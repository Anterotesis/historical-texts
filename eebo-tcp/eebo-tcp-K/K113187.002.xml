            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note>. The CONFESSIO AMANTIS, or the <hi>Lover's Confeſſion,</hi> is an Engliſh poem, in eight books, firſt printed by Caxton, in the year 1483. It was written at the command of Richard the ſecond; who meeting our poet Gower rowing on the Thames near London, invited him into the royal barge, and after much converſation requeſted him to <hi>book ſome new thing</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="bottom">TO THE REDER, in Berthlette's edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From the PROLOGUE. See ſupr. vol. i. p. 539. Notes.</note>.</p>
            <p>This tripartite work is repreſented by three volumes on Gower's curious tomb in the conventual church of Saint Mary Overee in Southwark, now remaining in its antient ſtate; and this circumſtance furniſhes me with an obvious opportunity of adding an anecdote relating to our poet's munificence and piety, which ought not to be omitted. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a poet, he largely contributed to rebuild that church in its preſent elegant form, and to render it a beautiful pattern of the lighter Gothic architecture: at the ſame time he founded, at his tomb, a perpetual chantry.</p>
            <p>It is on the laſt of theſe pieces, the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, that Gower's character and reputation as a poet are almoſt entirely founded. This poem, which bears no immediate reference to the other two diviſions, is a dialogue between a lover and his confeſſor, who is a prieſt of Venus, and, like the myſtagogue in the PICTURE of Cebes, is called Genius. Here, as if it had been impoſſible for a lover not to be a good catholic, the ritual of religion is applied to the tender paſſion, and Ovid's Art of Love is blended with the breviary. In the courſe of the confeſſion, every evil affection of the human heart, which may tend to impede the progreſs or counteract the ſucceſs of love, is ſcientifically ſubdivided; and its fatal effects exemplifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by a variety of appoſite ſtories, extracted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0373500102:10"/>
from claſſics and chronicles. The poet often introduces or recapitulates his matter in a few couplets of Latin long and ſhort verſes. This was in imitation of Boethius.</p>
            <p>This poem is ſtrongly tinctured with thoſe pedantic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations concerning the paſſion of love, which the French and Italian poets of the fourteenth century borrowed from the troubadours of Provence, and which I have above exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at large. But the writer's particular model appears more immediately to have been John of Meun's celebrated ROMAUNT DE LA ROSE. He has, however, ſeldom attempted to imitate the pictureſque imageries, and expreſſive perſonifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, of that exquiſite allegory. His moſt ſtriking pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits, which yet are conceived with no powers of creation, nor delineated with any fertility of fancy, are IDLENESS, AVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICE, MICHERIE or Thieving, and NEGLIGENCE, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Inſtead of boldly cloathing theſe qualities with corporeal attributes, aptly and poetically imagined, he coldly yet ſenſibly deſcribes their operations, and enumerates their properties. What Gower wanted in invention, he ſupplied from his common-place book; which appears to have been ſtored with an inexhauſtible fund of inſtructive maxims, pleaſant narrations, and philoſophical definitions. It ſeems to have been his object to croud all his erudition into this elaborate performance. Yet there is often ſome degree of contrivance and art in his manner of introducing and adapting ſubjects of a very diſtant nature, and which are totally foreign to his general deſign.</p>
            <p>In the fourth book, our confeſſor turns chemiſt; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing at large on the Hermetic ſcience, developes its principles, and expoſes its abuſes, with great penetration <note n="i" place="bottom">Lib. iv. f. 76. b. col. 2.</note>.

In another place he applies the Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautic expedition in ſearch of the golden fleece, which he relates at length, to the ſame viſionary philoſophy <note n="m" place="bottom">Lib. v. f. 101. a. ſeq.</note>.

            <p>In the ſeventh book, the whole circle of the Ariſtotelic philoſophy is explained; which our lover is deſirous to learn, ſuppoſing that the importance and variety of its ſpeculations might conduce to ſooth his anxieties by diverting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging his attention. Such a diſcuſſion was not very likely to afford him much conſolation: eſpecially, as hardly a ſingle ornamental digreſſion is admitted, to decorate a field na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo deſtitute of flowers. Almoſt the only one is the following deſcription of the chariot and crown of the ſun; in which the Arabian ideas concerning precious ſtones are interwoven with Ovid's fictions and the claſſical mythology.</p>

It might alſo be proved, that Gower, through this detail of the ſciences, copied in many other articles the SECRETUM SECRETORUM; which is a ſort of an abridgement of the Ariſtotelic philoſophy, filled with many Arabian innovations and abſurdities, and enriched with an appendix concerning the choice of wines, phlebotomy, juſtice, public notaries, tournaments, and phyſiognomy, rather than from the Latin tranſlations of Ariſtotle.

            <p>Theſe comprehenſive ſyſtems of all ſacred and profane events, which in the middle ages multiplied to an exceſſive degree, ſuperſeded the uſe of the claſſics and other eſtabliſhed authors, whoſe materials they gave in a commodious abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in whoſe place, by ſelecting thoſe ſtories only which ſuited the taſte of the times, they ſubſtituted a more agreeable kind of reading: nor was it by theſe means only, that they greatly contributed to retard the acquiſition of thoſe ornaments

of ſtyle, and other arts of compoſition, which an attention to the genuine models would have afforded, but by being written without any ideas of elegance, and in the moſt barbarous phraſeology. Yet productive as they were of theſe and other inconvenient conſequences, they were not without their uſe in the rude periods of literature. By gradually weaning the minds of readers from monkiſh legends, they introduced a reliſh for real and rational hiſtory; and kindling an ardour of inquiring into the tranſactions of paſt ages, at length awakened a curioſity to obtain a more accurate and authentic knowledge of important events by ſearching the original authors. Nor are they to be entirely neglected in modern and more poliſhed ages. For, beſides that they contain curious pictures of the credulity and ignorance of our anceſtors, they frequently preſerve facts tranſcribed from books which have not deſcended to poſterity. It is extremely probable, that the plan on which they are all conſtructed, that of deducing a perpetual hiſtory from the creation to the writer's age, was partly taken from Ovid's Metamorphoſes, and partly from the Bible.</p>
            <p>In the mean time there are three hiſtories of a leſs general nature, which Gower ſeems more immediately to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in ſome of his tales. Theſe are Colonna's Romance of Troy, the Romance of Sir Lancelot, and the GESTA ROMANORUM.</p>

            <p>In this mixture of moraliſation and narrative, the GESTA ROMANORUM ſomewhat reſembles the plan of Gower's poem. In the rubric of the ſtory of Julius and the poor knight, our author alludes to this book in the expreſſion, <hi>Hic ſecundum</hi> GESTA, &amp;c <note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. viii. f. 153. a. col. 1. And in other rubrics. In the rubric there is alſo GESTA ALEXANDRI, lib. iii. f. 61. a. col. 1. And in the ſtory of Sardanapalus, <q rend="inline">"Theſe olde GESTES tellen us,"</q> lib. iii. 167. a. col. 1.</note>. When he ſpeaks of the emperours of Rome paying reverence to a virgin, he ſays he found this cuſtom mentioned, <q rend="inline">"Of Rome among the GESTES olde <note n="b" place="bottom">Lib. v. f. 118. a. col. 2.</note>."</q> Yet he adds, that the GESTES took it from Valerius Maximus. The ſtory of Tarquin and his ſon Arrous is uſhered in with this line, <q rend="inline">"So as theſe olde GESTES ſeyne <note n="c" place="bottom">Lib. vii. f. 169. a. col. 1.</note>."</q> The tale of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, as I have hinted, is in the GESTA ROMANORUM; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for ſome parts of it Gower was perhaps indebted to Godfrey's PANTHEON abovementioned <note n="d" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol i. p. 150.

            <p>The poet is ſpeaking of a king whoſe officers and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers complained, that after a long attendance, they had not received adequate rewards, and preferments due to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. The king, who was no ſtranger to their complaints, artfully contrives a ſcheme to prove whether this defect proceded from his own want of generoſity, or their want of diſcernment.</p>

            <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that there is a much greater and a more beautiful variety of incidents in this ſtory as it is related in the GESTA ROMANORUM, which Shakeſpeare has followed, than in Gower: and was it not demonſtrable, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation preceded our author's age by ſome centuries, one would be tempted to conclude, that Gower's ſtory was the original fable in its ſimple unimproved ſtate.

            <p>In ſpeaking of our author's ſources, I muſt not omit a book tranſlated by the unfortunate Antony Widville, firſt earl of Rivers, chiefly with a view of proving its early po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity. It is the <hi>Dictes or Sayings of Philoſophres,</hi> which lord Rivers tranſlated from the French of William de Thignon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, provoſt of the city of Paris about the year 1408, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Les dictes moraux des philoſophes, les dictes des ſages et les ſecrets d' Ariſtote</hi>

            <p>It is pleaſant to obſerve the ſtrange miſtakes which Gower, a man of great learning, and the moſt general ſcholar of his age, has committed in this poem, concerning books which he never ſaw, his violent anachroniſms, and miſrepreſentations of the moſt common facts and characters. He mentions the Greek poet Menander, as one of the firſt hiſtorians, or <q rend="inline">"firſt enditours of the olde cronike,"</q> together with Eſdras, Solinus, Joſephus, Claudius Salpicius, Termegis, Pandulfe, Frigidilles, Ephiloquorus, and Pandas. It is extraordinary that Moſes ſhould not here be mentioned, in preference to Eſdras. Solinus is ranked ſo high, becauſe he recorded nothing but wonders <note n="x" place="bottom">Our author has a ſtory from Solinus concerning a monſtrous bird, lib. iii. f. 62. b. col. 2.

All Joſephus's works were printed in the old Latin tranſlation, at Verona 1480. fol. And frequently ſoon afterwards. They were tranſlated into French, German, Spaniſh, and Italian, and printed, between the years 1492 and 1554. See the COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANA GRECA, in Haym's Bibliothec. p. 6. 7.

            <p>The only claſſic Roman writers which our author cites are Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and Tully. Among the Italian poets, one is ſurpriſed he ſhould not quote Petrarch: he mentions Dante only, who in the rubric is called <q rend="inline">"a certain poet of Italy named Dante,"</q>

Among the aſtrological writers, he mentions Noah, Abraham, and Moſes.

At the mention of Ovid's name, the poet, with the dexterity and addreſs of a true maſter of

            <p>That this poem was written after Chaucer's FLOURE AND LEAFE, may be partly collected from the following paſſage, which appears to be an imitation of Chaucer, and is no bad ſpecimen of Gower's moſt poetical manner.

            <p>Chaucer at this time was ſixty-five years of age. The Court of Love, one of the pedantries of French gallantry, occurs often. In an addreſs to Venus, <q rend="inline">"Madame, I am a man of thyne, that in thy COURTE hath ſerved long <note n="r" place="bottom">Lib. i. f. 8. b. col. 1.</note>."</q> The lover obſerves, that for want of patience, a man ought <q rend="inline">"amonge the women alle, in LOVES COURTE, by <hi>judgement</hi> the name beare of paciant <note n="s" place="bottom">Lib. iii. f. 51. a. col. 1.</note>."</q> The confeſſor declares, that many perſons are condemned for diſcloſing ſecrets, <q rend="inline">"In LOVES COURTE, as it is ſaid, that lette their tonges gone untide <note n="t" place="bottom">Lib. iii. f. 52. a. col. 1.

            <p>There are alſo many manifeſt evidences which lead us to conclude, that this poem preceded Chaucer's CANTERBURY'S TALES, undoubtedly ſome of that poet's lateſt compoſitions, and probably not begun till after the year 1382. The MAN OF LAWES TALE is circumſtantially borrowed from Gower's CONSTANTIA <note n="u" place="bottom">Conf. Amant. Lib. ii f. 30. b. col. 2. See particularly, ibid. f. 35. b. col. 2. a. col. 1.

And Conf. Amant. Lib. iii. f. 48. a. col. 1. ſeq. Lib. viii. f. 175. a. col. 2. ſeq. I have juſt diſcovered, that the favourite ſtory of Apollonius, having appeared in antient Greek, Latin, Saxon, barbarous Greek, and old French, was at length tranſlated from French into Engliſh, and printed in the black letter, by Wynkyn de Worde, A. D. 1510. 4to. <q rend="inline">"Kynge Appolyn of Thyre."</q> [See ſupr. vol i. p. 350.] A copy is in my poſſeſſion.</note>. The WIFE OF BATHES TALE is founded

Although the GESTA ROMANORUM might have furniſhed both poets with this narrative. Chaucer, however, among other great improvements, has judiciouſly departed from the fable, in converting Sicily into the more popular court of king Arthur.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, in eſtimating Gower's merit, I have puſhed the notion too far, that becauſe he ſhews ſo much learning he had no great ſhare of natural abilities. But it ſhould be conſidered, that when books began to grow faſhionable, and the reputation of learning conferred the higheſt honour, poets became ambitious of being thought ſcholars; and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their native powers of invention to the oſtentation of diſplaying an extenſive courſe of reading, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the pride of profound erudition. On this account, the minſtrels of theſe times, who were totally uneducated, and poured forth ſpontaneous rhymes in obedience to the workings of nature, often exhibit more genuine ſtrokes of paſſion and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the profeſſed poets. Chaucer is an exception to this obſervation: whoſe original feelings were too ſtrong to be ſuppreſſed by books, and whoſe learning was overbalanced by genius.</p>
            <p>This affectation of appearing learned, which yet was natural at the revival of literature, in our old poets, even in thoſe who were altogether deſtitute of talents, has loſt to poſterity many a curious picture of manners, and many a romantic image. Some of our antient bards, however, aimed at no other merit, than that of being able to verſify; and attempted nothing more, than to cloath in rhyme thoſe ſentiments, which would have appeared with equal propriety in proſe.</p>

            <p>ONE of the reaſons which rendered the claſſic authors of the lower empire more popular than thoſe of a purer age, was becauſe they were chriſtians. Among theſe, no Roman writer appears to have been more ſtudied and eſteemed, from the beginning to the cloſe of the barbarous centuries, than Boethius. Yet it is certain, that his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical perſonifications and his viſionary philoſophy, founded on the abſtractions of the Platonic ſchool, greatly concurred to make him a favourite <note n="a" place="bottom">It is obſervable, that this SPIRIT OF PERSONIFICATION tinctures the writings of ſome of the chriſtian fathers, about, or rather before, this period. Moſt of the agents in the SHEPHERD of HERMAS are <hi>ideal</hi> beings. An ancient lady converſes with Hermas, and tells him that ſhe is the CHURCH OF GOD. Afterwards ſeveral virgins appear and diſcourſe with him; and when he deſires to be informed who they are, he is told by the SHEPHERD-ANGEL, that they are FAITH, ABSTINENCE, PATIENCE, CHASTITY, CONCORD, &amp;c.

            <p>The coronation of king Henry the fifth, was celebrated in Weſtminſter-hall with a ſolemnity proportioned to the luſtre of thoſe great atchievements which afterwards diſtinguiſhed the annals of that victorious monarch. By way of preſerving order, and to add to the ſplendor of the ſpectacle, many of the nobility were ranged along the ſides of the tables on large war-horſes, at this ſtately feſtival; which, ſays my chronicle, was a ſecond feaſt of Ahaſuerus <note n="q" place="bottom">Thomae de Elmham Vit. et Geſt. Henr. V. edit. Hearne, Oxon. 1727. cap. xii. p. 23. Compare Lel. Coll. APPEND. iii. 226. edit. 1770.</note>. But I mention this ceremony, to introduce a circumſtance very pertinent to our purpoſe; which is, that the number of harpers in the hall was innumerable <note n="r" place="bottom">Elmham, ubi ſupr. p. 23.</note>, who undoubtedly accompanied their inſtruments with heroic rhymes. The king, however, was no great encourager of the popular minſtrelſy, which ſeems at this time to have flouriſhed in the higheſt degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

            <p>It is in one of the royal manuſcripts of this poem in the Britiſh Muſeum that Occleve has left a drawing of Chaucer <note n="f" place="bottom">MSS. Reg. 17 D. vi. 1.</note>:

according to which, Chaucer's portraiture was made on his monument, in the chapel of Saint Blaſe in Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abbey, by the benefaction of Nicholas Brigham, in the year 1556 <note n="g" place="bottom">He was of Caverſham in Oxfordſhire. Educated at Hart-Hall in Oxford, and ſtudied the law. He died at Weſtminſter, 1559.</note>. And from this drawing, in 1598, John Speed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the print of Chaucer prefixed to Speght's edition of his works; which has been ſince copied in a moſt finiſhed engraving by Vertue <note n="h" place="bottom">In Urry's edit. 1721. fol.</note>. Yet it muſt be remembered, that the ſame drawing occurs in an Harleian manuſcript written about Occleve's age <note n="i" place="bottom">MSS. Harl. 4866. The drawing is at fol. 91.</note>, and in another of the Cottonian department <note n="k" place="bottom">MSS. Cotton. OTH. A. 18.</note>. Occleve himſelf mentions this drawing in his CONSOLATIO SERVILIS. It exactly reſembles the curious picture on board of our venerable bard, preſerved in the Bodleian gallery at Oxford. I have a very old picture of Chaucer on board, much like Occleve's, formerly kept in Chaucer's houſe, a quadrangular ſtone-manſion, at Woodſtock in Oxfordſhire; which commanded a proſpect of the ancient magnificent royal palace, and of many beautiful ſcenes in the adjacent park: and whoſe laſt remains, chiefly conſiſting of what was called Chaucer's bed-chamber, with an old carved oaken roof, evidently original, were demoliſhed about fifteen years ago. Among the ruins, they found an ancient gold coin of the city of Florence <note n="l" place="bottom">I think a FLOREIN, antiently common in England. Chaucer, PARDON.

Before the grand rebellion, there was in the windows of the church of Woodſtock, an eſcucheon in painted glaſs of the arms of ſir Payne Rouet, a knight of Henault, whoſe daughter Chaucer married.</p>
            <p>Occleve, in this poem, and in others, often celebrates Humphrey duke of Gloceſter <note n="m" place="bottom">As he does John of Gaunt.</note>; who at the dawn of ſcience
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0373500102:51"/>
was a ſingular promoter of literature, and, however unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for political intrigues, the common patron of the ſcholars of the times. A ſketch of his character in that view, is therefore too cloſely connected with our ſubject to be cenſured as an unneceſſary digreſſion. About the year 1440, he gave to the univerſity of Oxford a library containing ſix hundred volumes, only one hundred and twenty of which were valued at more than one thouſand pounds. Theſe books are called <hi>Novi Tractatus,</hi> or New Treatiſes, in the univerſity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regiſter <note n="n" place="bottom">Reg. F. fol. 52. 53. b.

They were the moſt ſplendid and coſtly copies that could be procured, finely written on vellum, and elegantly embelliſhed with miniatures and illuminations.

Only a ſingle ſpecimen of theſe valuable volumes was ſuffered to remain: it is a beautiful manuſcript in folio of Valerius Maximus, enriched with the moſt elegant decorations, and written in Duke Humphrey's age, evidently with a deſign of being placed in this ſumptuous collection. All the reſt of the books, which, like this, being highly ornamented, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like miſſals, and conveyed ideas of popiſh ſuperſtition, were deſtroyed or removed by the pious viſitors of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in the reign of Edward the ſixth, whoſe zeal was equalled only by their ignorance, or perhaps by their avarice.

               </gap> etymologiſts, to have corrupted the purity of the Engliſh language, by affecting to introduce ſo many foreign words and phraſes. But if we attend only to the politics of the times, we ſhall find theſe poets, as alſo ſome of their ſucceſſors, much leſs blameable in this reſpect, than the critics imagine. Our wars with France, which began in the reign of Edward the third, were of long continuance. The principal nobility of England, at this period, reſided in France, with their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, for many years. John king of France kept his court in England; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o which, excluſive of theſe French lords who were his fellow-priſoners, or neceſſary attendants, the chief nobles of his kingdom muſt have occaſionally reſorted. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the black prince made an expedition into Spain. John of Gaunt duke of Lancaſter, and his brother the duke of York, were matched with the daughters of Don Pedro king of Caſtile. All theſe circumſtances muſt have concurred to produce a perceptible change in the language of the court. It is rational therefore, and it is equitable to ſuppoſe, that inſtead of coining new words, they only complied with the common and faſhionable modes of ſpeech. Would Chaucer's poems have been the delight of thoſe courts in which he lived, had they been filled with unintelligible pedantries? The cotemporaries of theſe poets never complained of their obſcurity. But whether defenſible on theſe principles or not, they much improved the vernacular ſtyle by the uſe of this exotic phraſeology. It was thus that our primitive diction was enlarged and enriched. The Engliſh language owes its copiouſneſs, elegance, and harmony, to theſe innovations.</p>

            <p>I Conſider Chaucer as a genial day in an Engliſh ſpring. A brilliant ſun enlivens the face of nature with an unuſual luſtre: the ſudden appearance of cloudleſs ſkies, and the unexpected warmth of a tepid atmoſphere, after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter, fill our hearts with the viſionary proſpect of a ſpeedy ſummer: and we fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal ſerenity. But winter returns with redoubled horrors: the clouds condenſe more formidably than before; and thoſe tender buds, and early bloſſoms, which were called forth by the tranſient gleam of a temporary ſun-ſhine, are nipped by froſts, and torn by tempeſts.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the poets that immediately ſucceeded Chaucer, ſeem rather relapſing into barbariſm, than availing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of thoſe ſtriking ornaments which his judgment and imagination had diſcloſed. They appear to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to his vigour of verſification, and his flights of fancy. It was not indeed likely that a poet ſhould ſoon ariſe equal to Chaucer: and it muſt be remembered, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional diſtractions which enſued, had no ſmall ſhare in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the exerciſe of thoſe ſtudies which delight in peace and repoſe. His ſucceſſors, however, approach him in no degree of proportion. Among theſe, John Lydgate is the poet who follows him at the ſhorteſt interval.</p>
            <p>I have placed Lydgate in the reign of Henry the ſixth, and he ſeems to have arrived at his higheſt point of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence about the year 1430 <note n="t" place="bottom">In a copy of Lydgate's <hi>Chronicle of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Kings,</hi> there is a ſtanza of Edward the fourth.

But theſe pieces could not well be written by Lydgate. For he was ordained a ſubdeacon, 1389. Deacon, 1393. And prieſt, 1397. Regiſtr. Gul. Cratfield, abbatis de Bury, MSS. Cott. TIBER.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0373500102:58"/>
appeared before. He was a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Bury in Suffolk, and an uncommon ornament of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Yet his genius was ſo lively, and his accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo numerous, that I ſuſpect the holy father ſaint Benedict would hardly have acknowledged him for a genuine diſciple. After a ſhort education at Oxford, he travelled into France and Italy <note n="u" place="bottom">See one of his DITTIES, MSS. Harl. 2255. 41. fol. 148.

               </note>; and returned a complete maſter of the language and the literature of both countries. He chiefly ſtudied the Italian and French poets, particularly Dante, Boccacio, and Alain Chartier; and became ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed a proficient in polite learning, that he opened a ſchool in his monaſtery, for teaching the ſons of the nobility the arts of verſification, and the elegancies of compoſition. Yet although philology was his object, he was not unfamiliar with the faſhionable philoſophy: he was not only a poet and a rhetorician, but a geometrician, an aſtronomer, a the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologiſt, and a diſputant. On the whole I am of opinion, that Lydgate made conſiderable additions to thoſe amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our language, in which Chaucer, Gower, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleve led the way: and that he is the firſt of our writers whoſe ſtyle is cloathed with that perſpicuity, in which the Engliſh phraſeology appears at this day to an Engliſh reader.</p>
            <p>To enumerate Lydgate's pieces, would be to write the catalogue of a little library. No poet ſeems to have poſſeſſed a greater verſatility of talents. He moves with equal eaſe in every mode of compoſition. His hymns, and his ballads, have the ſame degree of merit: and whether his ſubject be the life of a hermit or a hero, of ſaint Auſtin or Guy earl of Warwick, ludicrous or legendary, religious or romantic, a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0373500102:59"/>
hiſtory or an allegory, he writes with facility. His tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were rapid from works of the moſt ſerious and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious kind to ſallies of levity and pieces of popular enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. His muſe was of univerſal acceſs; and he was not only the poet of his monaſtery, but of the world in general. If a diſguiſing was intended by the company of goldſmiths, a maſk before his majeſty at Eltham, a may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game for the ſheriffs and aldermen of London, a mumming before the lord mayor, a proceſſion of pageants from the creation for the feſtival of Corpus Chriſti, or a carol for the coronation, Lydgate was conſulted and gave the poetry <note n="x" place="bottom">See a variety of his pieces of this kind, MSS.

            <p>About the year 1430, Whethamſtede the learned and liberal abbot of ſaint Albans, being deſirous of familiariſing the hiſtory of his patron ſaint to the monks of his convent, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Lydgate, as it ſhould ſeem, then a monk of Bury, to tranſlate the Latin legend of his life in Engliſh rhymes. The chronicler who records a part of this anecdote ſeems to conſider Lydgate's tranſlation, as a matter of mere manual mechaniſm; for he adds, that Whethamſtede paid for the tranſlation, the writing, and illuminations, one hundred ſhillings.

            <p>Lydgate's manner is naturally verboſe and diffuſe. This circumſtance contributed in no ſmall degree to give a clearneſs and a fluency to his phraſeology. For the ſame reaſon he is often tedious and languid. His chief excellence is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, eſpecially where the ſubject admits a flowery diction.

But the common ſenſe of mankind had not yet attained a juſt eſtimate of things. Lydgate, in another piece, has verſified the rubrics of the miſſal, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the god Cupid: and declares, with how much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he frequently meditated on the holy legend of thoſe conſtant martyrs, who were not afraid to ſuffer death for the faith of that omnipotent divinity <note n="g" place="bottom">MSS. Fairfax, xvi. Bibl. Bodl.</note>. There are inſtances, in which religion was even made the inſtrument of love. Arnaud Daniel, a celebrated troubadour of the thirteenth century, in a fit of amorous deſpair, promiſes to found a multitude of annual maſſes, and to dedicate perpetual tapers to the ſhrines of ſaints, for the important purpoſe of obtaining the affections of an obdurate miſtreſs.</p>

            <p>The work is not improperly ſtyled a ſet of tragedies. It is not merely a narrative of men eminent for their rank and misfortunes. The plan is perfectly dramatic, and partly ſuggeſted by the pageants of the times. Every perſonage is ſuppoſed to appear before the poet, and to relate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſufferings: and the figures of theſe ſpectres are ſometimes finely drawn. Hence a ſource is opened for moving compaſſion, and for a diſplay of imagination. In ſome of the lives the author replies to the ſpeaker, and a ſort of dialogue is introduced for conducting the ſtory. Brunchild, a queen of France, who murthered all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and was afterwards hewn in pieces, appears thus.</p>

I muſt add, that it was Boethius's admired allegory on the CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY, which introduced perſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication into the poetry of the middle ages.</p>

            <p>Lydgate appears to have been far advanced in years when he finiſhed this poem: for at the beginning of the eighth book he complains of his trembling joints, and declares that age, having benumbed his faculties, has deprived him <q rend="inline">"of all the ſubtylte of curious makyng in Englyſshe to endyte <note n="u" place="bottom">B. vii.

            <p>I cannot quit this work without adding an obſervation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Boccacio, its original author, which perhaps may deſerve attention. It is highly probable that Boccacio learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many anecdotes of Grecian hiſtory and Grecian fable, not to be found in any Greek writer now extant, from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors Barlaam, Leontius, and others, who had lived at Conſtantinople while the Greek literature was yet flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some of theſe are perhaps ſcattered up and down in the compoſition before us, which contains a conſiderable part of the Grecian ſtory; and eſpecially in his treatiſe of the genealogies of the gods <note n="x" place="bottom">In fifteen books.

Peruſinus was librarian, about the year 1340, to Robert king of Jeruſalem and Sicily: and was the moſt curious and inquiſitive man of his age for ſearching after unknown or uncommon manuſcripts, eſpecially hiſtories, and poetical compoſitions, and particularly ſuch as were written in Greek. I will beg leave to cite the words of Boccacio, who records this anecdote. <q rend="inline">"Et, ſi uſquam CURIOSISSIMUS <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is natural to ſuppoſe that Boccacio, both from his connections and his curioſity, was no ſtranger to theſe treaſures: and that many of theſe pieces, thus imported into Italy by the diſperſion of the Conſtantinopolitan exiles, are only known at preſent through the medium of his writings. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that many oriental fictions found their way into Europe by means of this communication.</p>

            <p>This poem is the THEBAID of a troubadour. The old claſſical tale of Thebes is here cloathed with feudal manners, enlarged with new fictions of the Gothic ſpecies, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the deſcriptions, circumſtances, and machineries, appropriated to a romance of chivalry.

Tydeus and Polymite tilt at midnight for a lodging, before the gate of the palace of king Adraſtus; who is awakened with the din of the ſtrokes of their weapons, which ſhake all the palace, and deſcends into the court with a long train by torch-light: he orders the two combatants to be diſarmed, and cloathed in rich mantles ſtudded with pearls; and they are conducted to repoſe by <hi>many a ſtair</hi> to a ſtately tower, after being ſerved with a refection of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocras from golden goblets.

When Jaſon arrives at Cholcos, he is entertained by king Oetes in a Gothic caſtle. Amadis or Lancelot were never conducted to their fairy chambers with more ceremony and ſolemnity. He is led through many a hall and many a tower, by many a ſtair, to a ſumptuous apartment, whoſe walls, richly painted with the hiſtories of antient heroes, glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with gold and azure.</p>

Nor are we only preſented in this piece with the habits of feudal life, and the practices of chivalry. The poem is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with a multitude of oriental fictions, and Arabian traditions. Medea gives to Jaſon, when he is going to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat the brazen bulls, and to lull the dragon who guarded the golden fleece aſleep, a marvellous ring; in which was a gem whoſe virtue could deſtroy the efficacy of poiſon, and render the wearer inviſible. It was the ſame ſort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone, adds our author, which Virgil celebrates, and which Venus ſent her ſon Eneas that he might enter Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage unſeen. Another of Medea's preſents to Jaſon, to aſſiſt him in this perilous atchievement, is a ſilver image, or taliſman, which defeated all the powers of incantation, and was framed according to principles of aſtronomy <note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The hall of king Priam is illuminated at night by a prodigious carbuncle, placed among ſaphires, rubies, and pearls, on the crown of a golden ſtatue of Jupiter, fifteen cubits high <note n="c" place="bottom">B. ii. c. xi.</note>. In the court of the palace, was a tree made by magic, whoſe trunk was twelve cubits high; the branches, which overſhadowed diſtant plains, were alternately of ſolid gold and ſilver, bloſſomed with gems of various hues, which were renewed every day <note n="d" place="bottom">B. ii. c. xi.</note>. Moſt of theſe extravagancies, and a thouſand more, are in Guido de Colonna, who lived when this mode of fabling was at its height. But in the fourth book, Dares <hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phrigius is particularly cited for a deſcription of Priam's palace, which ſeemed to be founded by FAYRIE, or enchantment; and was paved with cryſtal, built of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, ſaphires, and emeralds, and ſupported by ivory pillars, ſurmounted with golden images <note n="f" place="bottom">Cap. xxvi.</note>.

            <p>Colonna, I believe, gave the Trojan ſtory its romantic additions. It had long before been falſified by Dictys and Dares; but thoſe writers, miſrepreſenting or enlarging Homer, only invented plain and credible facts. They were the baſis of Colonna: who firſt filled the faint outlines of their fabulous hiſtory with the colourings of eaſtern fancy, and adorned their ſcanty forgeries with the gorgeous trappings of Gothic chivalry. Or, as our author expreſſes himſelf in his Prologue, ſpeaking of Colonna's improvements on his originals.</p>

            <p>The account of the Trojan theatre muſt not be omitted, as it diſplays the imperfect ideas of the ſtage, at leaſt of dramatic exhibition, which now prevailed; or rather, the abſolute inexiſtence of this ſort of ſpectacle.

He defines a comedy to begin with complaint and to end with <hi>gladneſſe:</hi> expreſſing the actions of thoſe only who live in the loweſt condition. But tragedy, he informs us, begins in proſperity, and ends in adverſity: ſhewing the wonderful viciſſitudes of fortune which have happened in the lives of kings and mighty conquerours. In the theatre of Troy, he adds, was a pulpit, in which ſtood a poet, who rehearſed the <hi>noble dedes that were hiſtorial of kynges, prynces, and worthy emperours;</hi> and, above all, related thoſe fatal and ſudden cataſtrophes, which they ſometimes ſuffered by murther, poiſon, conſpiracy, or other ſecret and unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen machinations.</p>

            <p>In this detail of the dramatic exhibition which prevailed in the ideal theatre of Troy, a poet, placed on the ſtage in a pulpit, and characteriſtically habited, is ſaid to have recited a ſeries of tragical adventures; whoſe pathetic narrative was afterwards expreſſed, by the dumb geſticulations of a ſet of maſqued actors. Some perhaps may be inclined to think, that this imperfect ſpecies of theatric repreſentation, was the rude drama of Lydgate's age. But ſurely Lydgate would not have deſcribed at all, much leſs in a long and laboured digreſſion, a public ſhew, which from its nature was familiar and notorious. On the contrary, he deſcribes it as a thing obſolete, and exiſting only in remote times. Had a more perfect and legitimate ſtage now ſubſiſted, he would not have deviated from his ſubject, to communicate unneceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and to deliver ſuch minute definitions of tragedy and comedy. On the whole, this formal hiſtory of a theatre, conveys nothing more than an affected diſplay of Lydgate's learning; and is collected, yet with apparent inaccuracy and confuſion of circumſtances, from what the antient gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians have left concerning the origin of the Greek tragedy.

Or perhaps it might be borrowed by our author from ſome French paraphraſtic verſion of Colonna's Latin romance.</p>
            <p>Among the antient authors, beſide thoſe already mentioned, cited in this poem, are Lollius for the hiſtory of Troy, Ovid for the tale of Medea and Jaſon, Ulyſſes and Polyphemus, the Myrmidons and other ſtories, Statius for Polynices and Eteocles, the venerable Bede, Fulgentius the mythologiſt, Juſtinian with whoſe inſtitutes Colonna as a civilian muſt have been well acquainted, Pliny, and Jacobus de Vitriaco. The laſt is produced to prove, that Philometer, a famous philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, invented the game of cheſs, to divert a tyrant from his cruel purpoſes, in Chaldea; and that from thence it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into Greece. But Colonna, or rather Lydgate, is of a different opinion; and contends, in oppoſition to his authority, that this game, <hi>ſo ſotyll and ſo marvaylous,</hi> was diſcovered by <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent clerkes</hi> during the ſiege of Troy, and firſt practiced in that city.<note place="bottom">

            <p>I muſt not paſs over an inſtance of Lydgate's gallantry, as it is the gallantry of a monk. Colonna takes all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of ſatiriſing the fair ſex; and Lydgate with great politeneſs declares himſelf abſolutely unwilling to tranſlate thoſe paſſages of this ſevere moraliſt, which contain ſuch unjuſt and illiberal miſrepreſentations of the female cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Inſtead of which, to obviate theſe injurious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our tranſlator enters upon a formal vindication of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0373500102:103"/>
the ladies; not by a panegyric on their beauty, nor encomiums on thoſe amiable accompliſhments, by which they refine our ſenſibilities, and give elegance to life; but by a diſplay of that religious fortitude with which ſome women have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered martyrdom; or of that inflexible chaſtity, by means of which others have been ſnatched up alive into heaven, in a ſtate of genuine virginity. Among other ſtriking examples which the calendar affords, he mentions the tranſcendent grace of the eleven thouſand virgins who were martyred at Cologne in Germany. In the mean time, female ſaints, as I ſuſpect, in the barbarous ages were regarded with a greater degree of reſpect, on account of thoſe exaggerated ideas of gallantry which chivalry inſpired: and it is not improbable that the diſtinguiſhed honours paid to the virgin Mary might have partly proceeded from this principle.</p>
            <p>Among the anachroniſtic improprieties which this poem contains, ſome of which have been pointed out, the moſt conſpicuous is the fiction of Hector's ſepulchre, or tomb: which alſo merits our attention for another reaſon, as it affords us an opportunity of adding ſome other notices of the modes of antient architecture to thoſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The poet from Colonna ſuppoſes, that Hector was buried in the principal church of Troy, near the high altar, within a magnificent oratory, erected for that purpoſe, exactly reſembling the Gothic ſhrines of our cathedrals, yet charged with many romantic decorations.</p>

The ſtructure is ſupported by angels of gold. The ſteps are of cryſtall.

This is from the chemiſtry of the times. Before the body were four inextinguiſhible lamps in golden ſockets.

            <p>In the Bodleian library, there is a prodigious folio manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript on vellum, a tranſlation of Colonna's TROJAN HISTORY into verſe <note n="d" place="bottom">MSS. Laud. K. 76. fol.</note>; which has been confounded with Lydgate's TROYE-BOKE now before us. But it is an entirely different work, and is written in the ſhort minſtrel-metre. I have given a ſpecimen of the Prologue, above <note n="e" place="bottom">Supr. vol. i. p. 119. 120.</note>. It appears to me to be Lydgate's TROYE-BOKE diveſted of the octave ſtanza, and reduced into a meaſure which might more commodiouſly be ſung to the harp <note n="f" place="bottom">
                  <p>It may, however, be thought, that this poem is rather a tranſlation or imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome French original, as the writer often refers to <hi>The Romance.</hi> If this be the caſe, it is not immediately formed from the TROYE-BOKE of Lydgate, as I have ſuggeſted in the text. I believe it to be about Lydgate's age; but there is no other authority for ſuppoſing it to be written by Lydgate, than that, in the beginning of the Bodleian manuſcript now before us, a hand-writing, of about the reign of James the firſt, aſſigns it to that poet. I will give a few lines from the poem itſelf: which begins with Jaſon's expedition to Cholcos, the conſtant prelude to the Trojan ſtory in all the writers of this ſchool.</p>

            <p>Diocleſian, a powerful emperour in Germany, has a rupture with Barnard earl of Tholouſe, concerning boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of territory. Contrary to the repeated perſuaſions of the empreſs, who is extremely beautiful, and famous for her conjugal fidelity, he meets the earl, with a numerous army, in a pitched battle, to decide the quarrel. The earl is victorious, and carries home a great multitude of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, the moſt reſpectable of which is ſir Tralabas of Turky, whom he treats as his companion. In the midſt of their feſtivities they talk of the beauties of the empreſs; the earl's curioſity is inflamed to ſee ſo matchleſs a lady, and he promiſes liberty to ſir Tralabas, if he can be conducted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the emperour's court, and obtain a ſight of her without diſcovery. They both ſet forward, the earl diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed like a hermit. When they arrive at the emperour's court, ſir Tralabas proves falſe: treacherouſly imparts the ſecret to the empreſs that he has brought with him the earl
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0373500102:110"/>
of Tholouſe in diſguiſe, who is enamoured of her celebrated beauty; and propoſes to take advantage of ſo fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of killing the emperour's great and avowed enemy. She rejects the propoſal with indignation, injoyns the knight not to communicate the ſecret any farther, and deſires to ſee the earl next day in the chapel at maſs. The next day the earl in his hermit's weeds is conveniently placed at maſs. At leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chapel, he aſks an alms of the empreſs; and ſhe gives him forty florins and a ring. He receives the preſent of the ring with the higheſt ſatisfaction, and although obliged to return home, in point of prudence, and to avoid detection, comforts himſelf with this reflection.</p>

The monk pretending that the honour of his religion and character was affected by this inſinuation, challenges both the knights to combat: they are conquered; and the empreſs, after this trial, is declared innocent.

before I proceed in my ſeries, I will employ the remainder of this ſection in fixing the reader's attention on an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant circumſtance, now operating in its full extent, and therefore purpoſely reſerved for this period, which greatly contributed to the improvement of our literature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of our poetry: I mean the many tranſlations of Latin books, eſpecially claſſics, which the French had been making for about the two laſt centuries, and were ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to make, into their own language. In order to do this more effectually, I will collect into one view the moſt diſtinguiſhed of theſe verſions: not ſolicitous about thoſe notices on this ſubject which have before occurred inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; nor ſcrupulous about the charge of anticipation, which, to prepare the reader, I ſhall perhaps incur by lengthening this enquiry, for the ſake of comprehenſion, beyond the limits of the period juſt aſſigned. In the mean time it may be pertinent to premiſe, that from the cloſe communication which formerly ſubſiſted between England and France, manuſcript copies of many of theſe tranſlations, elegantly written, and often embelliſhed with the moſt ſplendid illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and curious miniatures, were preſented by the tranſlators or their patrons to the kings of England; and that they accordingly appear at preſent among the royal manuſcripts in the Britiſh Muſeum. Some of theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were tranſcribed, if not tranſlated, by command of our kings; and others brought into England, and placed in the royal library, by John duke of Bedford, regent of France.</p>

But to proceed, Caſſianus's COLLATIONES PATRUM, or the CONFERENCES, was tranſlated by John Goulain, a Carmelite monk, about 1363. Two tranſlations of that theological romance Boethius's CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLATION, one by the celebrated Jean de Meun, author of the ROMANCE OF THE ROSE, exiſted before the year 1340. Others of the early Latin chriſtian writers were ordered to be turned into French by queen Jane, about 1332. But finding that the archbiſhop of Rouen, who was commiſſioned to execute this arduous taſk, did not underſtand Latin, ſhe employed a mendicant friar.

The tranſlator in his Latin work called REPERTORIUM, a ſort of general dictionary, in which all things are proved to be allegorical, and reduced to a moral meaning, under the word ROMA, records this great attempt in the following manner. <q rend="inline">"TITUM LIVIUM, ad requiſitionem domini Johannis inclyti Francorum regis, <hi>non ſine labore et ſudoribus,</hi> in linguam Gallicam tranſtuli <note n="f" place="bottom">This was the tranſlation of Livy, which, with other books, the duke of Bedford, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of France, about 1425, ſent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to Humphrey duke of Glouceſter.

French, to poliſh and reform their old rude tranſlations made two hundred years before; and to reduce many of their metrical verſions into proſe. At the ſame time, the rage of tranſlating eccleſiaſtical tracts began to decreaſe. The latter circumſtance was partly owing to the introduction of better books, and partly to the invention of printing. Inſtead of procuring laborious and expenſive tranſlations of the antient fathers, the printers, who multiplied greatly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of this century, found their advantage in publiſhing new tranſlations of more agreeable books, or in giving antient verſions in a modern dreſs <note n="u" place="bottom">I take this opportunity of obſerving, that one of theſe was the romance of ſir LANCELOT DU LAC, tranſlated from the Latin by Robert de Borron, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Henry the ſecond or third.

Encouraged by this example, Jean de Luxembourgh, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence's cotemporary, tranſlated Tully's Oration againſt Verres. I muſt not forget, that Hippocrates and Galen were tranſlated from Latin into French in the year 1429. The tranſlator was Jean Tourtier, ſurgeon to the duke of Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, then regent of France; and he humbly ſupplicates Rauoul Palvin, confeſſor and phyſician to the ducheſs, and John Major, firſt phyſician to the duke, and graduate <hi>en l'eſtude d'Auxonford</hi>

The French romance, entitled L'ASSAILLANT, was now tranſlated from the Latin chronicles of the kings of Cologne: and the Latin tract DE BONIS MORIBUS of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Magnus, confeſſor to Charles the ſeventh, about the year 1422, was made French <note n="o" place="bottom">See ſupr. p. 61.

            <p>I am not exactly informed, when the ENEID of Virgil was tranſlated into a ſort of metrical romance or hiſtory of Eneas,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0373500102:128"/>
under the title of LIVRE D' ENEIDOS COMPILE PAR VIRGILE, by Guillaume de Roy. But that tranſlation was printed at Lyons in 1483, and appears to have been finiſhed not many years before. Among the tranſlator's hiſtorical additions, are the deſcription of the firſt foundation of Troy by Priam, and the ſucceſſion of Aſcanius and his deſcendants after the death of Turnus. He introduces a digreſſion upon Boccacio, for giving in his FALL OF PRINCES an account of the death of Dido, different from that in the fourth book of the Eneid. Among his omiſſions, he paſſes over Eneas's deſcent into hell, as a tale manifeſtly forged, and not to be believed by any rational reader: as if many other parts of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator's ſtory were not equally fictitious and incredible <note n="r" place="bottom">It was tranſlated, and printed, by Caxton, 1490.</note>.</p>
            <p>The concluſion intended to be drawn from this long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is obvious. By means of theſe French tranſlations, our countrymen, who underſtood French much better than Latin, became acquainted with many uſeful books which they would not otherwiſe have known. With ſuch aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, a commodious acceſs to the claſſics was opened, and the knowledge of antient literature facilitated and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ariſed in England, at a much earlier period than is imagined; and at a time, when little more than the productions of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative monks, and irrefragrable doctors, could be obtained or were ſtudied. Very few Engliſhmen, I will venture to pronounce, had read Livy before the tranſlation of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheur was imported by the regent duke of Bedford. It is certain that many of the Roman poets and hiſtorians were now read in England, in the original. But the Latin lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was for the moſt part confined to a few eccleſiaſtics. When theſe authors, therefore, appeared in a language almoſt as intelligible as the Engliſh, they fell into the hands of illiterate and common readers, and contributed to ſow the ſeeds of a national erudition, and to form a popular taſte.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0373500102:129"/>
Even the French verſions of the religious, philoſophical, hiſtorical, and allegorical compoſitions of thoſe more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened Latin writers who flouriſhed in the middle ages, had their uſe, till better books came into vogue: pregnant as they were with abſurdities, they communicated inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on various and new ſubjects, enlarged the field of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and promoted the love of reading, by gratifying that growing literary curioſity which now began to want materials for the exerciſe of its operations. How greatly our poets in general availed themſelves of theſe treaſures, we may collect from this circumſtance only: even ſuch writers as Chaucer and Lydgate, men of education and learning, when they tranſlate a Latin author, appear to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their work through the medium of a French verſion. It is needleſs to purſue this hiſtory of French tranſlation any farther. I have given my reaſon for introducing it at all. In the next age, a great and univerſal revolution in literature enſued; and the Engliſh themſelves began to turn their thoughts to tranſlation.</p>
            <p>Theſe French verſions enabled Caxton, our firſt printer, to enrich the ſtate of letters in this country with many valuable publications. He found it no difficult taſk, either by himſelf, or the help of his friends, to turn a conſiderable number of theſe pieces into Engliſh, which he printed. Antient learning had as yet made too little progreſs among us, to encourage this enterpriſing and induſtrious artiſt to publiſh the Roman autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is, however, remarkable, that from the year 1471, in which Caxton began to print, down to the year 1540, during which period the Engliſh preſs flouriſhed greatly under the conduct of many induſtrious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and even learned artiſts, only the very few following claſſics, ſome of which hardly deſerve that name, were printed in England. Theſe were, BOETHIUS <hi>de Conſolatione;</hi> both Latin and Engliſh, for Caxton, without date. The Latin ESO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIAN Fables, in verſe, for Wynkyn de Worde, 1503. 4to.

I believe the firſt Greek characters uſed in any work printed in England, are in Linacer's tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of <hi>Galen de Temperamentis,</hi> printed at Cambridge in 1521, 4to. A few Greek words, and abbreviatures, are here and there introduced.

But the printer apologiſes for his imperfections and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkillfulneſs in the Greek types; which, he ſays, were but recently caſt, and not in a ſufficient quantity for ſuch a work.

Aſhmol. Oxon. 34. membran.</note>. Our author is conciſe and compendious in his narrative of events from Brutus to the reign of king Henry the fourth: he is much more minute and diffuſe in relating thoſe affairs of which, for more than the ſpace of ſixty years, he was a living witneſs, and which occurred from that period to the reign of Edward the fourth. The poem ſeems to have been completed about the year 1470. In his final chapter he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the king, to recall his rival king Henry the ſixth, and to reſtore the partiſans of that unhappy prince.</p>
            <p>This work is almoſt beneath criticiſm, and fit only for the attention of an antiquary. Harding may be pronounced to be the moſt impotent of our metrical hiſtorians, eſpecially when we recollect the great improvements which Engliſh poetry had now received. I will not even except Robert of Glouceſter, who lived in the infancy of taſte and verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The chronicle of this authentic and laborious annaliſt has hardly thoſe more modeſt graces, which could properly recommend and adorn a detail of the Britiſh ſtory in proſe. He has left ſome pieces in proſe: and Winſtanly ſays, <q rend="inline">"as his proſe was very uſefull, ſo was his poetry as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull."</q> I am of opinion, that both his proſe and poetry are equally uſeful and delightful.

            <p>I am of opinion, that it was not cuſtomary for the royal laureate to write in Engliſh, till the reformation of religion had begun to diminiſh the veneration for the Latin language: or rather, till the love of novelty, and a better ſenſe of things, had baniſhed the narrow pedantries of monaſtic erudition, and taught us to cultivate our native tongue. In the mean time it is to be wiſhed, that another change might at leaſt be ſuffered to take place in the execution of this inſtitution, which is confeſſedly Gothic, and unaccommodated to modern manners. I mean, that the more than annual return of a compoſition on a trite argument would be no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. I am conſcious I ſay this at a time, when the beſt of kings affords the moſt juſt and copious theme for pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric: but I ſpeak it at a time, when the department is honourably filled by a poet of taſte and genius, which are idly waſted on the moſt ſplendid ſubjects, when impoſed by conſtraint, and perpetually repeated.</p>

When we read of the laureated poets of Italy and Germany, we are to remember, that they moſt commonly received this honour from the ſtate, or ſome univerſity; ſeldom, at leaſt not immediately, from the prince: and if we find any of theſe profeſſedly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the department of a court-poet, that they were not, in conſequence of that peculiar ſituation, ſtyled poets laureate.

            <p>BUT a want of genius will be no longer imputed to this period of our poetical hiſtory, if the poems lately diſcovered at Briſtol, and ſaid to have been written by Thomas Rowlie, a ſecular prieſt of that place, about the year one thouſand four hundred and ſeventy, are genuine.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that there are ſome circumſtances which incline us to ſuſpect theſe pieces to be a modern forgery. On the other hand, as there is ſome degree of plauſibility in the hiſtory of their diſcovery, as they poſſeſs conſiderable merit, and are held to be the real productions of Rowlie by many reſpectable critics; it is my duty to give them a place in this ſeries of our poetry, if it was for no other reaſon than that the world might be furniſhed with an opportunity of examining their authenticity. By exhibiting therefore the moſt ſpecious evidences, which I have been able to collect, concerning the manner in which they were brought to light <note n="a" place="bottom">I acknowledge myſelf greatly indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ingenious doctor Harrington of Bath, for facilitating my enquiries on this ſubject.</note>, and by producing ſuch ſpecimens, as in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect cannot be deemed unacceptable; I will endeavour, not only to gratify the curioſity of the public on a ſubject that has long engaged the general attention, and has never yet been fairly or fully ſtated, but to ſupply the more inquiſitive reader with every argument, both external and internal, for determining the merits of this intereſting controverſy.

            <p>In the year 1768, when the preſent new bridge at Briſtol was finiſhed and opened for paſſengers, an account of the ceremonies obſerved on occaſion of opening the old bridge, appeared in one of the Briſtol Journals; taken, as it was declared, from an antient manuſcript <note n="f" place="bottom">

               </note>. Curioſity was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally raiſed to know from whence it came. At length, after much enquiry concerning the perſon who ſent this ſingular memoir to the news-paper, it was diſcovered that he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0373500102:147"/>
was a youth about ſeventeen years old, whoſe name was Chatterton; and whoſe father had been ſexton of Radcliffe church for many years, and alſo maſter of a writing-ſchool in that pariſh, of which the church-wardens were truſtees. The father however was now dead: and the ſon was at firſt unwilling to acknowledge, from whom, or by what means, he had procured ſo valuable an original. But after many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſome threats, he confeſſed that he received a manuſcript on parchment containing the narrative above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, together with many other manuſcripts on parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from his father; who had found them in an iron cheſt, the ſame that I have mentioned, placed in a room ſituated over the northern entrance of the church.</p>
            <p>It appears that the father became poſſeſſed of theſe manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts in the year 1748. For in that year, he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the church-wardens of Radcliffe-church, to take from this cheſt ſeveral written pieces of parchment, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be illegible and uſeleſs, for the purpoſe of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into covers for the writing-books of his ſcholars. It is impoſſible to aſcertain, what, or how many, writings were deſtroyed, in conſequence of this abſurd and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable indulgence. Our ſchool-maſter, however, whoſe accompliſhments were much above his ſtation, and who was not totally deſtitute of a taſte for poetry, found, as it is ſaid, in this immenſe heap of obſolete manuſcripts, many poems written by Thomas Rowlie abovementioned, prieſt of Saint John's church in Briſtol, and the confeſſor of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman Cannynge, which he carefully preſerved. Theſe at his death, of courſe fell into the hands of his ſon.</p>
            <p>Of the extraordinary talents of this young man more will be ſaid hereafter. It will be ſufficient to obſerve at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that he ſaw the merit and value of theſe poems, which he diligently tranſcribed. In the year 1770, he went to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, carrying with him theſe tranſcripts, and many originals, in hopes of turning ſo in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

advantage. But from theſe flattering expectations, falling into a diſſipated courſe of life, which ill ſuited with his narrow circumſtances, and finding that a writer of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed taſte and judgement, Mr. Walpole, had pronounced the poems to be ſuſpicious, in a fit of deſpair, ariſing from diſtreſs and diſappointment, he deſtroyed all his papers, and poiſoned himſelf. Some of the poems however, both tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts and originals, he had previouſly ſold, either to Mr. Catcott, a merchant of Briſtol, or to Mr. Barrett, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſurgeon of the ſame place, and an ingenious antiquary, with whom they now remain <note n="g" place="bottom">Mr. Barrett, to whom I am greatly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But it appears, that among theſe there were but very few of parchment: moſt of the poems which they purchaſed were copies in his own hand. He was always averſe to give any diſtinct or ſatisfactory account of what he poſſeſſed: but from time to time, as his neceſſities required, he produced copies of his originals, which were bought by theſe gentlemen. The originals, one or two only excepted, he choſe to retain in his own poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The chief of theſe poems are, The TRAGEDY of ELLA, The EXECUTION of ſir CHARLES BAWDWIN, ODE to ELLA, The BATTLE of HASTINGS, The TOURNAMENT, one or two DIALOGUES, and a Deſcription of CANNYNGE'S FEAST.</p>
            <p>The TRAGEDY OF ELLA has ſix characters; one of which is a lady, named Birtha. It has a chorus conſiſting of minſtrels, whoſe ſongs are often introduced. Ella was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the caſtle of Briſtol, and a puiſſant champion againſt the Danes, about the year 920. The ſtory ſeems to be the poet's invention. The tragedy is opened with the following ſoliloquy.</p>

But he is oddly coupled with Chaucer in another reſpect, for he wrote only ſome Latin chronicles. Beſides, Lydgate muſt have been ſufficiently acquainted with Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's age; for he was living, and a young man, when Chaucer died. The writer alſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntions Stone, the Carmelite, as living with Chaucer and Turgotus: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was Lydgate's cotemporary. Theſe circumſtances, added to that of the extreme and affected meanneſs of the compoſition, evidently prove this little piece a forgery.</note>. I will give this piece at length.</p>

            <p>The BATTLE OF HASTINGS is called a tranſlation from the Saxon: and contains a minute deſcription of the perſons, arms, and characters of many of the chiefs, who fought in that important action. In this poem, Stonehenge is deſcribed as a Druidical temple.</p>
            <p>The poem called the TOURNAMENT, is dramatically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, among others, by the characters of a herald, a knight, a minſtrel, and a king, who are introduced ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>The following piece is a deſcription of an alderman's feaſt at Briſtol; or, as it is entitled, ACCOUNTE OF W. CANNYNGE'S FEAST.</p>

The ODE TO ELLA, and the EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE to Lydgate, with his ANSWER, were written on one piece of parchment; and, as pretended, in Rowlie's own hand. This was ſhewn to an ingenious critic and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent antiquary of my acquaintance; who aſſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> me, that the writing was a groſs and palpable forgery. It was not even ſkilfully counterfeited. The form of the letters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance, differed very eſſentially from every one of our early alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets. Nor were the characters uniform and conſiſtent: part of the ſame manuſcript exhibiting ſome letters ſhaped

according to the preſent round hand, while others were traced in imitation of the antient court and text hands. The parchment was old; and that it might look ſtill older, was ſtained on the outſide with ochre, which was eaſily rubbed off with a linen cloth. Care had alſo been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow caſt. To communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a ſtronger ſtamp of rude antiquity, the ODE was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten like proſe: no diſtinction, or termination, being made between the ſeveral verſes. Lydgate's ANSWER, which makes a part of this manuſcript, and is written by the ſame hand, I have already proved to be a manifeſt impoſition. This parchment has ſince been unfortunately loſt <note n="d" place="bottom">At the ſame time, another manuſcript on parchment, written, as pretended, by Rowlie, was ſhewn to this gentleman: which, tallying in every reſpect with the ODE to ELLA, plainly appeared to be forged, in the ſame manner, and by the ſame modern hand. It was in proſe; and contained an account of Saxon coins, and the riſe of coining in England, with a liſt of coins, poems, antient inſcriptions, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and other curioſities, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of Cannynge abovementioned. This parchment is alſo loſt; and, I believe, no copy remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NYNGE'S FEAST. It is likewiſe on parchment, and, I am ſorry to ſay, that the writing betrays all the ſuſpicious ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures which were obſerved in that of the ODE TO ELLA. I have repeatedly and diligently compared it with three or four authentic manuſcripts of the time of Edward the fourth, to all which I have found it totally unlike. Among other ſmaller veſtiges of forgery, which cannot be ſo eaſily deſcribed and explained here, at the bottom are added in ink two coats of arms, containing empalements of Cannynge and of his friends or relations, with family-names, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently delineated by the ſame pen which wrote the verſes. Even the ſtyle and drawing of the armorial bearings diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the hand of a modern herald. This, I believe, is the only pretended original of the poetry of Rowlie, now remaining.</p>

As to internal arguments, an unnatural affectation of antient ſpelling and of obſolete words, not belonging to the period aſſigned to the poems, ſtrikes us at firſt ſight. Of theſe old words combinations are frequently formed, which never yet exiſted in the unpoliſhed ſtate of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh language: and ſometimes the antiquated diction is moſt inartificially miſapplied, by an improper contexture with the preſent modes of ſpeech. The attentive reader will alſo diſcern, that our poet ſometimes forgets his aſſumed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and does not always act his part with conſiſtency: for the chorus, or interlude, of the damſel who drowns herſelf, which I have cited at length from the TRAGEDY of ELLA, is much more intelligible, and free from uncouth expreſſions, than the general phraſeology of theſe compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, ſaid to be tranſlated from the Saxon, Stonehenge is called a Druidical temple. The battle of Haſtings was fought in the year 1066. We will grant the Saxon original to have been written ſoon afterwards: about which time, no other notion prevailed concerning this miraculous monument, than the ſuppoſition which had been delivered down by long and conſtant tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was erected in memory of Hengiſt's maſſacre. This was the eſtabliſhed and uniform opinion of the Welſh and Armorican bards, who moſt probably received it from the Saxon minſtrels: and that this was the popular belief at the time of the battle of Haſtings, appears from the evidence of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote his hiſtory not more than eighty years after that memorable event. And in this doctrine Robert of Glouceſter and all the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh chroniclers agree. That the Druids conſtructed this ſtupendous pile for a place of worſhip, was a diſcovery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the ſagacity of a wiſer age, and the laborious diſcuſſion of modern antiquaries. In the EPISTLE to Lyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, prefixed to the TRAGEDY, our poet condemns the abſurdity and impropriety of the religious dramas, and recommends
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0373500102:162"/>
SOME GREAT STORY OF HUMAN MANNERS, as moſt ſuitable for theatrical repreſentation. But this idea is the reſult of that taſte and diſcrimination, which could only belong to a more advanced period of ſociety <note n="e" place="bottom">
                  <p>It would be tedious and trifling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to minute particulars. But I will mention one or two. In the ODE TO ELLA, the poet ſuppoſes, that the ſpectre of Ella ſometimes appears in the <hi>mynſter,</hi> that is Briſtol-cathedral. But when Rowlie is ſuppoſed to have lived, the preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral of Briſtol was nothing more than an Auguſtine monaſtery, in which Henry the eighth eſtabliſhed long afterwards a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and a dean and chapter, in the year 1542. <hi>Minſter</hi> is a word almoſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to Cathedrals: and I will venture to ſay, that the church of this monaſtery, before the preſent foundation took place, never was called <hi>Briſtol-minſter,</hi> or <hi>The min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> The inattention to this circumſtance, has produced another unfortunate anachro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm in ſome of Rowlie's papers.

                  <p>The deſcription of Cannynge's feaſt, is called an ACCOUNTE of CANNYNGE'S FEAST. I do not think, that ſo early as the year 1470, the word <hi>Accounte</hi> had loſt its literal and original ſenſe of a <hi>computus,</hi> or <hi>computation,</hi> and was uſed in a looſer acceptation for <hi>narrative</hi> or <hi>detail.</hi> Nor had it even then loſt its true ſpelling <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,</hi> in which its proper and primary ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification is preſerved and implied.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>But, above all, the caſt of thought, the complexion of the ſentiments, and the ſtructure of the compoſition, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove theſe pieces not antient. The ODE TO ELLA, for inſtance, has exactly the air of modern poetry; ſuch, I mean, as is written at this day, only diſguiſed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ſpelling and phraſeology. That Rowlie was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed literary character, a ſcholar, an hiſtorian, and an antiquarian, if contended for, I will not deny <note n="f" place="bottom">He is alſo ſaid to have been an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent mechanic and mathematician. I am informed, that one of Rowlie's manuſcripts diſcovered in Cannynge's iron cheſt, was a plan for ſupporting the tower of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-church in B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſtol, which had greatly declined from its perpendicular. In a late reparation of that church, ſome ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous works were found, minutely correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with this manuſcript.</note>. Nor is it impoſſible that he might write Engliſh poetry. But that he is the writer of the poems which I have here cited, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0373500102:163"/>
which have been ſo confidently aſcribed to him, I am not yet convinced.</p>
            <p>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that theſe poem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were compoſed by the ſon of the ſchool-maſter before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; who inherited the ineſtimable treaſures of Cannynge's cheſt in Radcliffe-church, as I have already related at large. This youth, who died at eighteen, was a prodigy of genius: and would have proved the firſt of Engliſh poets, had he reached a maturer age. From his childhood, he was fond of reading and writing verſes: and ſome of his early com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which he wrote without any deſign to deceive, have been judged to be moſt aſtoniſhing productions by the firſt critic of the preſent age. From his ſituation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, he became a ſkilful practitioner in various kinds of hand-writing. Availing himſelf therefore of his poetical talent, and his facility in the graphic art, to a miſcellany of obſcure and neglected parchments, which were commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly placed in his own poſſeſſion, he was tempted to add others of a more intereſting nature, and ſuch as he was enabled to forge, under theſe circumſtances, without the fear of detection. As to his knowledge of the old Engliſh literature, which is rarely the ſtudy of a young poet, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of obſolete words and phraſes were readily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable from the gloſſary to Chaucer, and to Percy's Ballads. It is confeſſed, that this youth wrote the EXECUTION OF SIR CHARLES BAWDWIN: and he who could forge that poem, might eaſily forge all the reſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, we will allow, that ſome pieces of poetry written by Rowlie might have been preſerved in Cannynge's cheſt: and that theſe were enlarged and improved by young Chatterton. But if this was the caſe, they were ſo much altered as to become entirely new compoſitions. The poem which bids the faireſt to be one of theſe originals is CANNYNGE'S FEAST. But the parchment-manuſcript of this little poem has already been proved to be a forgery. A circumſtance
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0373500102:164"/>
which is perhaps alone ſufficient to make us ſuſpect that no originals ever exiſted.</p>
            <p>It will be aſked, for what end or purpoſe did he contrive ſuch an impoſture? I anſwer, from lucrative views; or perhaps from the pleaſure of deceiving the world, a motive which, in many minds, operates more powerfully than the hopes of gain. He probably promiſed himſelf greater emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments from this indirect mode of exerciſing his abilities: or, he might have ſacrificed even the vanity of appearing in the character of an applauded original author, to the private enjoyment of the ſucceſs of his invention and dexterity.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved above, that Cannynge ordered his iron cheſt in Radcliffe-church to be ſolemnly viſited once in every year, and that an annual entertainment ſhould be provided for the viſitors. In the notices relating to this matter, which ſome of the chief patrons of Rowlie's poetry hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> lately ſent me from Briſtol, it is affirmed, that this order is contained in Cannynge's will: and that he ſpecifies therein, that not only his manuſcript evidences abovementioned, but that the POEMS of HIS CONFESSOR ROWLIE, which likewiſe he had depoſited in the aforeſaid iron cheſt, were alſo to be ſubmitted to this annual inſpection. This circumſtance at firſt ſtrongly inclined me to think favourably of the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of theſe pieces. At leaſt it proved, that Rowlie had left ſome performances in verſe. But on examining Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge's will, no ſuch order appears. All his bequeſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Radcliffe-church, of every kind, are the following. He leaves legacies to the vicar, and the three clerks, of the ſaid church: to the two chantry-prieſts, or chaplains, of his foundation: to the keeper of the PYXIS OBLATIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUM, in the north-door: and to the fraternity <hi>Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moracionis martirum.</hi> Alſo veſtments to the altars of ſaint Catharine, and ſaint George. He mentions his tomb built near the altar of ſaint Catharine, where his late wife is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerred. He gives augmentations to the endowment of his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0373500102:165"/>
two chantries <note n="g" place="bottom">Compare Willis, MITR. ABB. ii. 88.</note>, at the altars of ſaint Catharine and ſaint George, abovementioned. To the choir, he leaves two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-books, called <hi>Liggers,</hi> to be uſed there, on either ſide, by his two chantry-prieſts. He directs, that his funeral ſhall be celebrated in the ſaid church with a <hi>month's mind,</hi> and the uſual ſolemnities <note n="h" place="bottom">

            <p>Very few anecdotes of Rowlie's life have deſcended to poſterity. The following MEMOIRS of his life are ſaid to have been written by himſelf in the year 1460, and to have been diſcovered with his poetry: which perhaps to many readers will appear equally ſpurious.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I was fadre confeſſour to maſteres Roberte and maſtre William Cannings. Maſtre Roberte was a man after his fadre's own harte, greedie of gaynes and ſparying of alms deedes; but maſter William was mickle courteous, and gave me many marks in my needs. At the age of twenty-two years deceasd maſter Roberte, and by maſter William's deſyre,

Maſter William, ſaid I, if you command me I will go to Roome for you; not ſo farr diſtant, ſaid he: I ken you for a mickle learnd prieſt, if you will leave the paryſh of our ladie, and travel for mee, it ſhall be mickle to your profits.</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the phraſe <hi>to draw a picture</hi> might have been now known: but to <hi>draw,</hi> in its preſent uncombined uſe, had not yet acquired this meaning. So late as the reign of James the firſt, a Painter was often called a <hi>picture-drawer.</hi> In antient inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of furniture, a <hi>drawing</hi> never occurs as any ſpecies of production of the art of deſigning: it became a technical and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing term when that art began to attain ſome degree of maturity. <hi>Pictures,</hi> although this word is now confined to a preciſe ſignification, would not have been improper here. Yet the word <hi>Picture</hi> was not antiently uſed in its preſent ſenſe and manner: but, a <hi>picture with a cloth, a table with a picture,</hi> &amp;c.</note>, if of anie account at any price.

Maſter Canning thought no workman culd be found handie enough to do it.—The tale of the drawers deſerveth relation.—Thomas de Blunderville, a preeſte, although
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0373500102:167"/>
the preeſte had no allows, lovd a fair mayden, and on her begett a ſonn. Thomas educated his ſoon; at ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years he went into the warrs, and neer did return for five years.—His mother was married to a knight, and bare a daughter, then ſixteen, who was ſeen and lovd by Thomas, ſon of Thomas, and married to him unknown to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by Ralph de Meſching, of the Minſter, who invited, as cuſtom was, two of his brothers, Thomas de Blunderville and John Heſchamme. Thomas nevertheleſs had not ſeen his ſonn for five years, kenning him inſtauntly; and learning the name of the bryde, toke him aſyde and diſcloſd to him that he was his ſonn, and was weded to his own ſiſtre.—Yoyng Thomas toke on ſo that he was ſhorne.</p>

               <p>The abott of the minſter of Peterburrow ſold it me, he might have bargaynd twenty marks better, but maſter Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam would not depart with it. The prior of Coventree did ſell me a picture of great account, made by Badilian Y'al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyanne, who did lyve in the rayne of kyng Henrie the firſt, a mann of fickle temper, havyng been tendred ſyx pounds of ſilver for it, to which he ſaid naie, and afterwards did give it to the then abott<note n="n" place="bottom">This ſhould have been <hi>Prior.</hi> An <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> was never the title of the ſuperiour in cathedral-convents.

               <p>I had now mickle of ryches, and lyvd in a houſe on the hyll, often repayrings to maſtere William, who was now lord of the houſe. I ſent him my verſes touching his church, for which he did ſend me mickle good things.</p>
               <p>In the year kyng Edward came to Briſtow, Maſter Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſend for me to avoid a marriage which the kyng was bent upon between him and a ladie he neer had ſeen, of the familee of the Winddivilles, the danger where nigh, unleſs avoided by one remidee, an holie one, which was, to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a ſonn of holy church, beyng franke from the power of kynges in that cauſe, and can be wedded.—Mr. Cannings inſtauntly ſent me to Carpenter, his good friend, biſhop of Worceſter, and the Fryday following was prepaird and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynd the next day, the daie of Saint Mathew, and on Sunday ſung his firſt maſs in the church of our ladie <note n="o" place="bottom">Moſt probably Worceſter cathedral.</note>, to the aſtoniſhing of kyng Edward, who was ſo furiouſly madd and ravyngs withall, that maſter Cannings was wyling to give him three thouſand markes, which made him peace again, and he was admyted to the preſence of the kyng, ſtaid in Briſtow, partook of all his pleaſures and paſtimes till he departed the next year <note n="p" place="bottom">See above, p. 153.</note>.</p>

            <p>It is with regret that I find myſelf obliged to pronounce Rowlie's poems to be ſpurious. Antient remains of Engliſh poetry, unexpectedly diſcovered, and fortunately reſcued from a long oblivion, are contemplated with a degree of fond enthuſiaſm: excluſive of any real or intrinſic excellence, they afford thoſe pleaſures, ariſing from the idea of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which deeply intereſt the imagination. With theſe pleaſures we are unwilling to part. But there is a more ſolid ſatisfaction, reſulting from the detection of artifice and impoſture.</p>

Although concerned with three ſaints, he deals more in plain facts than in the fictions of religious romance; and, on the whole, his performance is rather hiſtorical than legendary. This is remarkable, in an age, when it was the faſhion to turn hiſtory into legend <note n="c" place="bottom">

A great tranſlator of the lives of the Saxon ſaints, from the Saxon, in which language only they were then extant, into Latin, was Goſcelinus, a monk of Saint Auſtin's at Canterbury, who paſſed from France into England, with Herman, biſhop of Saliſbury, about the year 1058 <note n="e" place="bottom">W. Malmeſbur. lib. iv. ubi infr.—Goſcelin. in Praefatt. ad Vit. S. Auguſtini. See Mabillon, ACT. BEN. Saec. i. p. 499.</note>. As the Saxon language was at this time but little underſtood, theſe tranſlations opened a new and ample treaſure of religious hiſtory: nor were they acquiſitions only to the religion, but to the literature, of that era. Among the reſt, were the Lives of ſaint Werburgh <note n="f" place="bottom">Printed, ACT. SANCTOR. Bolland. tom. i. februar. p. 386. A part in Leland, Coll. ii. 154. Compare MSS. C. C. C. Cant.

In the regiſter of Ely it is recorded, that he was the moſt eloquent writer of his age; and that he circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all over England, the lives, miracles, and GESTS, of the ſaints of both ſexes, which he reduced into proſe-hiſtories <note n="k" place="bottom">Cap. x.

He has the character of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Latin writer; and ſeems to have done the ſame piece of ſervice, perhaps in the ſame way, to other religious houſes. From his EPISTLES, it appears that he wrote the life of ſaint <hi>Wolfade,</hi> patron of the priory of canons regular of his native town of Stone in Staffordſhire, which he dedicated to the prior, William de Madely. Epiſt. iii. dat. 1399. [MSS. Bibl. Bodl. Sup. D i. Art. 123.] He was Latin ſecretary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral biſhops, and could poſſibly write a legend or a letter with equal facility. His epiſtles are 123 in number. The firſt of them, in which he is ſtiled <hi>chancellour to the biſhop of Wincheſter,</hi> is to the archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterbury.

                  <p>The moſt extraordinary compoſition of this kind, if we conſider, among other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that it was compiled at a time when knowledge and literature had made ſome progreſs, and when mankind were ſo much leſs diſpoſed to believe or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miracles, more eſpecially when the ſubject was quite recent, is the LEGEND of KING HENRY the SIXTH. It is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, <hi>De</hi> MIRACULIS <hi>beatiſſimi illius Militis Chriſti, Henrici ſexti, etc.</hi> That it might properly rank with other legends, it was tranſlated from an Engliſh copy into Latin, by one Johannes, ſtyled <hi>Pauperculus,</hi> a monk, about the year 1503, at the command of John Morgan, dean of Windſor, afterwards biſhop of ſaint David's. It is divided into two books: to both of which, prefaces are prefixed, containing proofs of the miracles wrought by this pious monarch. At the beginning, there is a hymn, with a prayer, addreſſed to the royal ſaint. fol. 72.

            <p>Among the many ſtriking contraſts between the manners and characters of antient and modern life, which theſe annals preſent, we muſt not be ſurpriſed to find a mercer, a ſheriff, and an alderman of London, deſcending from his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant occupations, to write verſes. This is Robert Fabyan, who yet is generally better known as an hiſtorian, than as a poet. He was eſteemed, not only the moſt facetious, but the moſt learned, of all the mercers, ſheriffs, and aldermen, of his time: and no layman of that age is ſaid to have been better ſkilled in the Latin language. He flouriſhed about the year 1494. In his CHRONICLE, or <hi>Concordance of hiſtories,</hi> from Brutus to the year 1485, it is his uſual practice, at the diviſion of the books, to inſert metrical prologues, and other pieces in verſe. The beſt of his metres is the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLAINT of king Edward the ſecond; who, like the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages in Boccacio's FALL OF PRINCES, is very dramatically introduced, reciting his own misfortunes <note n="o" place="bottom">Fol. 171. tom. ii. edit. 1533.

As an hiſtorian, our author is the dulleſt of compilers. He is equally attentive to the ſucceſſion of the mayors of London, and of the monarchs of England: and ſeems to have thought the dinners at guildhall, and the pageantries of the city-companies, more intereſting tranſactions, than our victories in France, and our ſtruggles for public liberty at home. One of Fabyan's hiſtorical anecdotes, under the important reign of Henry the fifth, is, that a new weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock was placed on the croſs of Saint Paul's ſteeple. It is ſaid, that cardinal Wolſey commanded many copies of this chronicle to be committed to the flames, becauſe it made too ample a diſcovery of the exceſſive revenues of the clergy. The earlier chapters of theſe childiſh annals faithfully record all thoſe fabulous traditions, which generally ſupply the place of hiſtoric monuments in deſcribing the origin of a great nation.</p>
            <p>Another poet of this period is John Watſon, a prieſt. He wrote a Latin theological tract entitled SPECULUM CHRISTIANI, which is a ſort of paraphraſe on the decalogue and the creed <note n="r" place="bottom">MSS. C. C. C. Oxon. 155. MSS. Laud. G. 12. MSS. Thoreſb. 530. There is an abridgement of this work, [MSS. Harl. 2250. 20.] with the date 1477. This is rather beyond the period with which we are at preſent engaged.</note>. But it is interſperſed with a great number of wretched Engliſh rhymes: among which, is the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hymn to the virgin Mary <note n="s" place="bottom">

            <p>Caxton, the celebrated printer, was likewiſe a poet; and beſide the rhyming introductions and epilogues with which he frequently decorates his books, has left a poem of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length, entitled the WORKE OF SAPIENCE <note n="w" place="bottom">Printed by him, without date. fol. in thirty-ſeven leaves.</note>. It comprehends, not only an allegorical fiction concerning the two courts of the caſtle of Sapience, in which there is no imagination, but a ſyſtem of natural philoſophy, grammar, logic, rhetoric, geometry, aſtronomy, theology, and other
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0373500102:201"/>
topics of the faſhionable literature. Caxton appears to be the author, by the prologue: yet it is not improbable, that he might on this occaſion employ ſome profeſſed verſifier, at leaſt as an aſſiſtant, to prepare a new book of original poetry for his preſs. The writer's deſign, is to deſcribe the effects of wiſdom from the beginning of the world: and the work is a hiſtory of knowledge or learning. In a viſion, he meets the goddeſs SAPIENCE in a delightful meadow; who conducts him to her caſtle, or manſion, and there diſplays all her miraculous operations. Caxton, in the poem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the <hi>gylted goddeſs</hi> and <hi>mooſt facundyous lady</hi> Clio, apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſes to thoſe <hi>makers</hi> who delight in <hi>termes gay,</hi> for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elegancies of language which as a foreigner he could not avoid, and modeſtly declares, that he neither means to rival or envy Gower and Chaucer.</p>

            <p>In the eighth chapter of our KALENDER are deſcribed the ſeven viſions, or the puniſhments in hell of the ſeven deadly ſins, which Lazarus ſaw between his death and reſurrection. Theſe puniſhments are imagined with great ſtrength of fancy, and accompanied with wooden cuts boldly touched, and which the printer Wynkyn de Worde probably procured from ſome German engraver at the infancy of the art <note n="e" place="bottom">Compare the torments of Dante's hell.

To the WRATHFULL is aſſigned a gloomy cavern, in which their bodies are butchered, and their limbs mangled

by demons with various weapons. The SLOTHFULL are tormented in a <hi>horrible hall dark and tenebrous,</hi> ſwarming with innum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The COVETOUS are dipped in cauldrons filled with boiling metals. The GLUTTONOUS are placed in a vale near a loathſome pool, abounding with venomous creatures, on whoſe banks tables are ſpread, from which they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually crammed with toads by devils. CONCUPISCENCE is puniſhed in a field full of immenſe pits or wells, overflowing with fire and ſulphur. This viſionary ſcene of the infernal puniſhments ſeems to be borrowed from a legend related by Matthew Paris, under the reign of king John: in which the ſoul of one Thurkhill, a native of Tidſtude in Eſſex is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by ſaint Julian from his body, when laid aſleep, into hell and heaven. In hell he has a ſight of the torments of the damned, which are preſented under the form and name of the INFERNAL PAGEANTS, and greatly reſemble the fictions I have juſt deſcribed. Among the tormented, is a knight, who had paſſed his life in ſhedding much innocent blood at tilts and tournaments. He is introduced, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly armed, on horſeback; and couches his lance againſt the demon, who is commiſſioned to ſeize and to drag him to his eternal deſtiny. There is likewiſe a prieſt who never ſaid maſs, and a baron of the exchequer who took bribes. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill is then conducted into the manſions of the bleſſed, which are painted with ſtrong oriental colouring: and in Paradiſe, a garden repleniſhed with the moſt delicious fruits, and the moſt exquiſite variety of trees, plants, and flowers, he ſees Adam, a perſonage of gigantic proportion, but the moſt beautiful ſymmetry, reclined on the ſide of a fountain which ſent forth four ſtreams of different water and colour, and under the ſhade of a tree of immenſe ſize and height, laden with fruits of every kind, and breathing the richeſt odours. Afterwards ſaint Julian conveys the ſoul of Turkhill back to

            <p>As the ideas of magnificence and elegance were enlarged, the public pageants of this period were much improved: and beginning now to be celebrated with new ſplendour, received, among other advantages, the addition of SPEAKING PERSONAGES. Theſe ſpectacles, thus furniſhed with ſpeakers, characteriſtically habited, and accompanied with proper ſcenery, co-operated with the MYSTERIES, of whoſe nature they partook at firſt, in introducing the drama. It was cuſtomary to prepare theſe ſhews at the reception of a prince, or any other ſolemnity of a ſimilar kind: and they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on moveable theatres, or occaſional ſtages, erected in the ſtreets. The ſpeeches were in verſe; and as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion moved forward, the ſpeakers, who conſtantly bore ſome alluſion to the ceremony, either converſed together in the form of a dialogue, or addreſſed the noble perſon whoſe preſence occaſioned the celebrity.

            <p>I have obſerved in a former work, and it is a topic which will again be conſidered in its proper place, that the frequent and familiar uſe of allegoric perſonifications in the public pageants, I mean the general uſe of them, greatly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to form the ſchool of Spenſer <note n="p" place="bottom">See Obſ. FAIRY QUEEN. ii. 90.</note>. But moreover from what is here ſaid, it ſeems probable, that the PAGEAUNTS, which being ſhewn on civil occaſions, derived great part of their decorations and actors from hiſtorical fact, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently made profane characters the ſubject of public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, dictated ideas of a regular drama, much ſooner than the MYSTERIES: which being confined to ſcripture ſtories, or rather the legendary miracles of ſainted martyrs, and the no leſs ideal perſonifications of the chriſtian virtues, were not calculated to make ſo quick and eaſy a tranſition to the repreſentations of real life and rational action.</p>
            <p>In the year 1501, when the princeſs Catharine of Spain came to London, to be married to prince Arthur, her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion through the city was very magnificent. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants were numerous, and ſuperbly furniſhed; in which the principal actors, or ſpeakers, were not only God the father, ſaint Catharine, and ſaint Urſula, but king Alphonſus the aſtronomer and an anceſtor of the princeſs, a Senator, an Angel, Job, Boethius, Nobility, and Virtue. Theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages ſuſtained a ſort of action, at leaſt of dialogue. The
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0373500102:209"/>
lady was compared to Heſperus, and the prince to Arcturus; and Alphonſus, from his ſkill in the ſtars, was introduced to be the fortune-teller of the match <note n="q" place="bottom">Chron. MS.</note>. Theſe machineries were contrived and directed by an eccleſiaſtic of great eminence, biſhop Fox; who, ſays Bacon, <q rend="inline">"was not only a grave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor for war or peace, but alſo a good ſurveyor of works, and a good maſter of ceremonies, and any thing elſe that was fit for the active part, belonging to the ſervice of court, or ſtate of a great king."</q> It is probable, that this prelate's dexterity and addreſs in the conduct of a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rareeſhow procured him more intereſt, than the gravity of his counſels, and the depth of his political knowledge: at leaſt his employment in this buſineſs preſents a ſtriking picture of the importance of thoſe popular talents, which even in an age of blind devotion, and in the reign of a ſuperſtitious monarch, were inſtrumental in paving the way to the moſt opulent dignities of the church. <q rend="inline">"Whoſoever, adds the ſame pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating hiſtorian, had theſe toys in compiling, they were not altogether PEDANTICAL <note n="r" place="bottom">Bacon's HENRY THE SEVENTH.

            <p>In the mean time it is to be granted, that profane cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were perſonated in our pageants, before the cloſe of the fourteenth century. Stowe relates, that in the year

1377, for the entertainment of the young prince Richard, ſon of Edward the black prince, one hundred and thirty citizens rode diſguiſed from Newgate to Kennington where the court reſided, attended with an innumerable multitude of waxen torches, and various inſtruments of muſic, in the evening of the Sunday preceding Candlemas-day. In the firſt rank were forty-eight, habited like eſquires, with viſors; and in the ſecond the ſame number, in the character of knights. <q rend="inline">"Then followed one richly arrayed like an EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEROR, and after him, at ſome diſtance, one ſtately-tyred like a POPE, whom followed twenty-four CARDINALLS, and after them eyght or tenne with blacke viſors not amiable, as if they had been LEGATES from ſome forrain princes."</q> But this parade was nothing more than a DUMB SHEW, unaccompanied with any kind of interlocution. This appears from what follows. For our chronicler adds, that when they entered the hall of the palace, they were met by the prince, the queen, and the lords; <q rend="inline">"whom the ſaid mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers did ſalute, <hi>ſhewing by a pair of dice their deſire to play with the prince,</hi>"</q> which they managed with ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance and ſkill, that the prince won of them a bowl, a cup, and a ring of gold, and the queen and lords, each, a ring of gold.

In the year 1487, while Henry the ſeventh kept his reſidence at the caſtle at Wincheſter, on occaſion of the birth of prince Arthur, on a ſunday, during the time of dinner, he was entertained with a religious drama called CHRISTI DESCENSUS AD INFEROS, or <hi>Chriſt's deſcent into hell</hi>

This is the only proof I have ever ſeen of choir-boys acting in the old MYSTERIES: nor

                  <p>The ſtrongeſt argument which induces me to give this poem to Hawes, and not to Lydgate, is, that it was printed in Hawes's life-time, with his name, by Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyn de Worde. Bale alſo mentions, among Hawes's poems, <hi>Templum Cryſtallinum</hi> in one book. There is, however, a no leſs ſtrong argument for giving it to Lydgate, and that is from Hawes himſelf; who, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing Lydgate's Works, in the PASTIME OF PLEASURE, ſays thus, [ch. xiv. edit. 1555. Signat. G. iiii. ut infr.]
<q>
                        <l>—And the tyme to paſſe</l>

                     </q>
And I muſt add, that this piece is expreſsly recited in the large catalogue of Lydgate's works, belonging to W. Thinne, in Speght's edition of Chaucer, printed 1602. fol. 376. Yet on the whole, I think this point ſtill doubtful: and I leave it to be determined by the reader, before whom the evidence on both ſides is laid at large.</p>

be a copy of the HOUSE OF FAME of CHAUCER, in which that poet ſees in a viſion a temple of glaſs, on the walls of which were engraved ſtories from Virgil's En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id and Ovid's Epiſtles. It alſo ſtrongly reſembles that part of Chaucer's ASSEMBLY OF FOULES, in which there is the fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a temple of braſs, built on pillars of jaſper, whoſe walls are painted with the ſtories of unfortunate lovers <note n="i" place="bottom">V. 290.</note>. And in his ASSEMBLY of LADIES, in a chamber made of beryl and cryſtal, belonging to the ſumptuous caſtle of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt Regard,</hi> the walls are decorated with hiſtorical ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſame kind <note n="k" place="bottom">V. 451.</note>. The ſituation of Hawes's TEMPLE on a craggy rock of ice, is evidently taken from that of Chaucer's HOUSE OF FAME. In Chaucer's DREAME, the poet is tranſported into an iſland, where <hi>wall and yate was all of glaſſe</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="bottom">V. 72.</note>. Theſe ſtructures of glaſs have their origin in the chemiſtry of the dark ages. This is Hawes's exordium.</p>

            <p>If the poems of Rowlie are not genuine, the PASTIME OF PLEASURE is almoſt the only effort of imagination and invention which had yet appeared in our poetry ſince Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. This poem contains no common touches of romantic and allegoric fiction.

The model of his verſification and phraſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is that improved harmony of numbers, and facility of diction, with which his predeceſſor Lydgate adorned our octave ſtanza. But Hawes has added new graces to Lydgate's manner.

PERSEVERANCE tells our hero, that this monſter was framed by the two witches STRANGENESS and DISDAINE, to puniſh La Bell Pucell for having baniſhed them from her preſence. His body was compoſed of the ſeven metals, and within it a demon was incloſed. They now enter a neighbouring temple of Pallas; who ſhews Amoure, in a trance, the ſecret formation of this monſter, and gives him a box of wonderful ointment. They walk on the ſea-ſhore, and eſpy two ladies rowing towards them; who land, and having told Amoure that they are ſent by PATIENCE to enquire his

They arrive in the iſland; and Amoure diſcovers the monſter near a rock, whom he now examines more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Amoure, in imitation of Jaſon, anoints his ſword and armour with the unguent of Pallas; which, at the firſt onſet, preſerves him from the voluminous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of fire and ſmoke iſſuing from the monſter's mouth. At length he is killed; and from his body flew out a <hi>foule ethiope,</hi> or black ſpirit, accompanied with ſuch a ſmoke that all the iſland was darkened, and loud thunder-claps enſued.

This was natural at the beginning of the typographic art. Many of Chaucer's poems were now recently printed by Caxton.</p>
                  <p>With regard to Millorie's book, much, if not moſt, of it, I believe, is taken from the great French romance of LANCELOT, tranſlated from Latin into French at the command of one of our Henrys, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Engliſh verſion of which is now in Benet library at Cambridge.

But, beſide the proofs there ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, in favour of that hypotheſis, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Henry the third paid great attention to theſe compoſitions, from the following curious anecdote juſt publiſhed, which throws new light on that monarch's character.</p>
                  <p>Arnaud Daniel, a troubadour, highly celebrated by Dante and Petrarch, about the year 1240 made a voyage into England, where, in the court of king Henry the third, he met a minſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

The king, who appears to have much intereſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the diſpute, allowed them ten days for <hi>compoſing,</hi> and five more for <hi>learning to ſing,</hi> their reſpective pieces: after which, each was to exhibit his performance in the preſence of his majeſty. The third day, the Engliſh minſtrel announced that he was ready. The troubadour declared he had not wrote a line; but that he had tried, and could not as yet put two words together. The following evening he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the minſtrel practiſing his <hi>chanſon</hi> to himſelf. The next day he had the good fortune to hear the ſame again, and learned the air and words. At the day appointed they both appeared before the king. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud deſired to ſing firſt. The minſtrel, in a fit of the greateſt ſurpriſe and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuddenly cried out, <hi>C'eſt ma chanſon, This is</hi> MY SONG. The king ſaid it was impoſſible. The minſtrel ſtill inſiſted upon it; and Arnaud, being cloſely preſſed, ingenuouſly told the whole affair. The king was much entertained with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; and ordering the wager to be withdrawn, loaded them with rich preſents. But he afterwards obliged Arnaud to give a <hi>chanſon</hi> of his own compoſition. Millot, ut ſupr. tom. ii. p. 491.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to deny, that Henry the ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged theſe pieces; for it partly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Gualter Mapes, archdeacon of Oxford, tranſlated, from Latin into French, the popular romance of SAINT GRAAL, at the inſtance of Henry the ſecond, to whom he was chaplain, about the year 1190.

Barklay's principal work is the SHIP OF FOOLES, above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. About the year 1494, Sebaſtian Brandt, a learned civilian of Baſil, and an eminent philologiſt, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a ſatire in German with this title <note n="i" place="bottom">I preſume this is the ſame Sebaſtian Brandt, to whom Thomas Acuparius, poet laureate, dedicates a volume of Poggius's works, Argentorat. 1513. fol. He is here ſtyled, <q rend="inline">"Juris utriuſque doctor, et. S. P. Q. Argentinenſis cancellarius."</q> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication is dated 1511. See Hendreich. PANDECT. p. 703.</note>. The deſign was to ridicule the reigning vices and follies of every rank and profeſſion, under the allegory of a Ship freighted with Fools of all kinds, but without any variety of incident, or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality of fable; yet although the poem is deſtitute of plot, and the voyage of adventures, a compoſition of ſuch a nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extremely popular. It was tranſlated into French <note n="k" place="bottom">By Joce Bade. Paris, 1497.</note>; and, in the year 1497, into tolerable Latin verſe, by James Locher, a German, and a ſcholar of the inventour Brandt <note n="l" place="bottom">See THE PROLOGUE.</note>. From the original, and the two tranſlations, Barklay formed a large Engliſh poem, in the balade or octave ſtanza, with conſiderable additions gleaned from the follies of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. It was printed by Pinſon, in 1509, whoſe name occurs in the poem.

            <p>The TOWRE OF VERTUE AND HONOUR, introduced as a ſong of one of the ſhepherds into theſe paſtorals, exhibits no very maſterly ſtrokes of a ſublime and inventive fancy. It has much of the trite imagery uſually applied in the fabrication of theſe ideal edifices. It, however, ſhews our author in a new walk of poetry. This magnificent tower, or caſtle, is built on inacceſſible cliffs of flint: the walls are of gold, bright as the ſun, and decorated with <hi>olde hiſtoryes and pictures manyfolde:</hi> the turrets are beautifully ſhaped. Among its heroic inhabitants are king Henry the eighth, Howard duke of Norfolk, and the earl of Shrewſbury. LABOUR is the porter at the gate, and VIRTUE governs the houſe. LABOUR is thus pictured, with ſome degree of ſpirit.</p>

                  <l>Fearfull is LABOUR, without favour at all,</l>

            <p>IT is not the plan of this work to comprehend the Scotch poetry. But when I conſider the cloſe and national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between England and Scotland in the progreſs of manners and literature, I am ſenſible I ſhould be guilty of a partial and defective repreſentation of the poetry of the former, was I to omit in my ſeries a few Scotch writers, who have adorned the preſent period, with a degree of ſentiment and ſpirit, a command of phraſeology, and a fertility of imagination, not to be found in any Engliſh poet ſince Chaucer and Lydgate: more eſpecially as they have left ſtriking ſpecimens of allegorical invention, a ſpecies of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which appears to have been for ſome time almoſt totally extinguiſhed in England.</p>
            <p>The firſt I ſhall mention is William Dunbar, a native of Salton in Eaſt Lothian, about the year 1470. His moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated poems are The THISTLE AND THE ROSE, and THE GOLDEN TERGE.</p>
            <p>The THISTLE AND THE ROSE was occaſioned by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of James the fourth, king of Scotland, with Margaret Tudor, eldeſt daughter of Henry the ſeventh, king of England: an event, in which the whole future political ſtate of both nations was vitally intereſted, and which ultimately produced the union of the two crowns and kingdoms. It was finiſhed on the ninth day of May in the year 1503, nearly three months before the arrival of the queen in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: whoſe progreſs from Richmond to Edinburgh was attended with a greater magnificence of parade, proceſſions, and ſpectacles, than I ever remember to have ſeen on any ſimilar occaſion <note n="a" place="bottom">See a memoir, cited above, in Leland's COLL. tom. iii. APPEND. edit. 1770. p. 265. It is worthy of particular notice, that during this expedition there was in the magnificent ſuite of the princeſs a company of players, under the direction of one John Ingliſh, who is ſometimes called Johannes. <q rend="inline">"Amonge the ſaide lordes and the qweene was in order, Johannes and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye, the menſtrells of muſicke, &amp;c."</q> p 267. See alſo, p. 299. 300. 280. 289. In the midſt of a moſt ſplendid proceſſion, the princeſs rode on horſe-back behind the king into the city of Edinburgh, p. 287. Afterwards the ceremonies of this ſtately marriage are deſcribed; which yet is not equal, in magnificence and expence, to that of Richard the ſecond with Iſabell of France, at Calais, in the year 1397. This laſt-mentioned marriage is recorded with the moſt minute circumſtances, the dreſſes of the king and the new queen, the names of the French and Engliſh nobility who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the preſents, one of which is a golden cup ſtudded with jewels, and worth three thouſand pounds, given on both ſides, the banquets, entertainments, and a variety of other curious particulars, in five large vellum pages, in an antient Regiſter of Merton priory in Surrey, in old French.

The poet replies, that the ſpring of the preſent year was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing and ungenial; unattended with the uſual ſong of birds, and ſerenity of ſky: and that ſtorms and ſhowers, and the loud blaſts of the horn of <hi>lord</hi> Eolus, had uſurped her mild dominion, and hitherto prevented him from wandering at leiſure under the vernal branches. MAY rejects his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and with a ſmile of majeſty commands him to ariſe, and to perform his annual homage to the flowers, the birds, and the ſun.

She crowns the roſe with <hi>clarefied</hi> gems, the luſtre of which illumines all the land. The roſe is hailed queen by the flowers. Laſt, her praiſes are ſung by the univerſal chorus of birds, the ſound of which awakens the poet from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful dream. The fairy ſcene is vaniſhed, and he calls to the muſe to perpetuate in verſe the wonders of the ſplendid viſion.</p>
            <p>Although much fine invention and ſublime fabling are diſplayed in the allegorical viſions of our old poets, yet this mode of compoſition, by dealing only in imaginary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, and by excluding real characters and human actions, neceſſarily fails in that chief ſource of entertainment which we ſeek in antient poetry, the repreſentation of antient manners.</p>
            <p>Another general obſervation, immediately reſulting from the ſubject of this poem, may be here added, which illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the preſent and future ſtate of the Scotch poetry. The marriage of a princeſs of England with a king of Scotland, from the new communication and intercourſe opened between the two courts and kingdoms by ſuch a connection, muſt have greatly contributed to poliſh the rude manners, and to improve the language, literature, and arts, of Scotland.</p>
            <p>The deſign of Dunbar's GOLDEN TERGE, is to ſhew the gradual and imperceptible influence of love, when too far indulged, over reaſon. The diſcerning reader will obſerve, that the caſt of this poem is tinctured with the morality and imagery of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE, and the FLOURE AND LEAFE, of Chaucer.</p>
            <p>The poet walks forth at the dawn of a bright day. The effects of the riſing ſun on a vernal landſcape, with its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companiments, are thus delineated in the manner of Lyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, yet with more ſtrength, diſtinctneſs, and exuberance of ornament.</p>

Immediately the poet receives a deadly wound, and is taken priſoner by BEAUTY; who now aſſumes a more engaging air, as the clear eye of REASON is growing dim by intoxication. DISSIMULATION then tries all her arts on the poet: FAIR CALLING ſmiles upon him: CHERISHING ſooths him with ſoft ſpeeches: NEW ACQUAINTANCE embraces him awhile, but ſoon takes her leave, and is never ſeen afterwards.

Dunbar is not leſs ſuited to ſatirical than to ſublime allegory: and that he is the firſt poet who has appeared with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſpirit in this way of writing ſince Pierce Plowman. His THISTLE AND ROSE, and GOLDEN TERGE, are generally and juſtly mentioned as his capital works: but the natural complexion of his genius is of the moral and didactic caſt. The meaſure of this poem is partly that of Sir THOPAS in Chaucer: and hence we may gather by the way, that Sir THOPAS was antiently viewed in the light of a ludicrous compoſition. It is certain that the pageants and interludes of Dunbar's age muſt have quickened his invention to form thoſe groteſque groupes. The exhibition of MORALITIES was now in high vogue among the Scotch. A Morality was played at the marriage of James the fourth and the princeſs Margaret <note n="d" place="bottom">MEMOIR, ut ſupr. p. 300.</note>. Mummeries, which they call GYSARTS, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of moral perſonifications, are ſtill known in Scotland: and even till the beginning of this century, eſpecially among the feſtivities of Chriſtmas, itinerant maſkers were admitted into the houſes of the Scotch nobility.</p>

            <p>ANother of the diſtinguiſhed luminaries, that marked the reſtoration of letters in Scotland at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſixteenth century, not only by a general emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in elegant erudition, but by a cultivation of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacular poetry of his country, is Gawen Douglaſs. He was deſcended from a noble family, and born in the year 1475 <note n="e" place="bottom">Hume, HIST. DOUGL. p. 219.</note>. According to the practice of that age, eſpecially in Scotland, his education perhaps commenced in a grammar-ſchool of one of the monaſteries: there is undoubted proof, that it was finiſhed at the univerſity of Paris. It is probable, as he was intended for the ſacred function, that he was ſent to Paris for the purpoſe of ſtudying the canon law: in conſequence of a decree promulged by James the firſt, which tended in ſome degree to reform the illiteracy of the clergy, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, that no eccleſiaſtic of Scotland ſhould be preferred to a prebend of any value without a competent ſkill in that ſcience <note n="f" place="bottom">Leſl.

Among other high promotions in the church, which his very ſingular accompliſhments obtained, he was provoſt of the collegiate church of ſaint Giles at Edinburgh, abbot of the opulent convent of Abberbrothrock, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Dunkeld. He appears alſo to have been nominated by the queen regent to the archbiſhoprick, either of Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow, or of ſaint Andrew's: but the appointment was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiated by the pope <note n="g" place="bottom">Thynne, CONTINUAT.

            <p>The poetical beauties of this ſpecimen will be reliſhed by every reader who is fond of lively touches of fancy, and rural imagery. But the verſes will have another merit with thoſe critics who love to contemplate the progreſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and to mark the original workings of genuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as they are the effuſion of a mind not overlaid by the deſcriptions of other poets, but operating, by its own force and bias, in the delineation of a vernal landſcape, on ſuch objects as really occurred. On this account, they deſerve to be better underſtood: and I have therefore tranſlated them into plain modern Engliſh proſe. In the mean time, this experiment will ſerve to prove their native excellence. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of poetic numbers and expreſſion, they ſtill retain their poetry; and, to uſe the compariſon of an elegant writer on a like occaſion, appear like Ulyſſes, ſtill a king and conqueror, although diſguiſed like a peaſant, and lodged in the cottage of the herdſman Eumaeus.</p>

The ſilver-ſcaled fiſhes, on the gravel, gliding haſtily, as it were from the heat or ſun, through clear ſtreams, with fins ſhining brown as cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, and chiſſel-tails, darted here and there.

Towers, turrets, battlements, and high pinnacles, of churches, caſtles, and every fair city, ſeemed to be painted; and, together with every baſtion and ſtory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their own ſhape on the plains. The glebe, fearleſs of the northern blaſts, ſpread her broad boſom.—The corn-crops, and the new-ſprung barley, recloathed the earth with a gladſome garment.—The variegated veſture of the valley covered the cloven furrow; and the barley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands were diverſified with flowery weeds. The meadow was beſprinkled with rivulets: and the freſh moiſture of the dewy night reſtored the herbage which the cattle had cropped in the day. The bloſſoms in the blowing garden

The budding cluſters of the tender grapes hung end-long, by their tendrils, from the trelliſes. The gems of the trees unlocking, expanded themſelves into the foliage of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's tapeſtry. There was a ſoft verdure after balmy ſhowers. The flowers ſmiled in various colours on the bending ſtalks. Some red, &amp;c. Others, watchet, like the blue and wavy ſea; ſpeckled with red and white; or, bright as gold. The daiſy unbraided her little coronet. The graſs ſtood embattelled, with banewort, &amp;c. The ſeeded down flew from the dandelion. Young weeds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among the leaves of the ſtrawberries. Gay gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, &amp;c. The roſe buds, putting forth, offered their <hi>red vernal lips</hi> to be kiſſed; and diffuſed fragrance from the criſp ſcarlet that ſurrounded their golden ſeeds. Lilies, with white curling tops, ſhewed their creſts open. The odorous vapour moiſtened the ſilver webs that hung from the leaves. The plain was powdered with round dewy pearls. From every bud, ſcyon, herb, and flower, bathed in liquid fragrance, the bee ſucked ſweet honey.—The ſwans clamoured amid the ruſtling reeds; and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the lakes and gray rivers where to build their neſts. The red bird of the ſun lifted his coral creſt, crowing clear among the plants and <hi>rutis gent,</hi> picking his food from every path, and attended by his wives Toppa and Partlet. The painted peacock with gaudy plumes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded his tail like a bright wheel, inſhrouded in his ſhining feathers, reſembling the marks of the hundred eyes of Argus. Among the boughs of the twiſted olive, the ſmall birds framed their artful neſts, or along the thick hedges, or rejoiced with their merry mates on the tall oaks.

The reply of SYR COMMONWEALTH to our poet's queſtion, is a long and general ſatire on the corrupt ſtate of Scotland.

Saint Jerom, it is true, tranſlated the bible into Latin, his own natural language; but had ſaint Jerom been born in Argyleſhire, he would have tranſlated it into Erſe. King David wrote the pſalter in Hebrew, becauſe he was a Jew. Hence he very ſenſibly takes occaſion to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the propriety and neceſſity of publiſhing the ſcriptures and the miſſal, and of compoſing all books intended for common uſe, in the reſpective vernacular language of every country. This objection being anſwered, which ſhews the ideas of the times, our author thus deſcribes the creation of the world and of Adam.</p>

It was in this reign, that the nobility of Scotland began to frequent the court; which ſoon became the theatre of all thoſe idle amuſements which were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to ſolicit the attention of a young king. All theſe abuſes are painted in this poem with an honeſt unreſerved indignation. It muſt not in the mean time be forgotten, that James poſſeſſed eminent abilities, and a love of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: nor is it beſide our preſent purpoſe to obſerve, that he was the author of the celebrated ballad called CHRIST'S KIRK ON THE GREEN <note n="i" place="bottom">Printed at Oxford, by Edm.

            <p>The COMPLAYNT OF THE PAPINGO is a piece of the like tendency. In the Prologue, there is a curious and critical catalogue of the Scotch poets who flouriſhed about the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, fifteenth, and ſixteenth centuries. As the names and works of many of them ſeem to be totally forgotten, and as it may contribute to throw ſome new lights on the neglected hiſtory of the Scotch poetry, I ſhall not ſcruple to give the paſſage at large, with a few illuſtrations. Our author declares, that the poets of his own age dare not aſpire to the praiſe of the three Engliſh poets, Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate. He then, under the ſame idea, makes a tranſition to the moſt diſtinguiſhed poets, who formerly flouriſhed in Scotland.</p>

            <p>The Scotch, from that philoſophical and ſpeculative caſt which characteriſes their national genius, were more zealous and early friends to a reformation of religion than their neighbours in England. The pomp and elegance of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic worſhip made no impreſſion on a people, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion ſought only for ſolid edification; and who had no notion that the interpoſition of the ſenſes could with any propriety be admitted to cooperate in an exerciſe of ſuch a nature, which appealed to reaſon alone, and ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all aids of the imagination. It was natural that ſuch a people, in their ſyſtem of ſpiritual refinement, ſhould warmly prefer the ſevere and rigid plan of Calvin: and it is from this principle, that we find moſt of their writers, at the reſtoration of learning, taking all occaſions of cenſuring
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0373500102:328"/>
the abſurdities of popery with an unuſual degree of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and aſperity.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of the poem before us, an allegory on the corruptions of the church is introduced, not deſtitute of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, humour, and elegance: but founded on one of the weak theories of Wickliffe, who not conſidering religion as reduced to a civil eſtabliſhment, and becauſe Chriſt and his apoſtles were poor, imagined that ſecular poſſeſſions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſimplicity of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>In the primitive and pure ages of chriſtianity, the poet ſuppoſes, that the Church married Poverty, whoſe children were Chaſtity and Devotion. The emperour Conſtantine ſoon afterwards divorced this ſober and decent couple; and without obtaining or aſking a diſpenſation, married the Church with great ſolemnity to Property. Pope Silveſter ratified the marriage: and Devotion retired to a hermitage. They had two daughters, Riches and Senſuality; who were very beautiful, and ſoon attracted ſuch great and univerſal regard, that they acquired the chief aſcendancy in all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affairs. Such was the influence of Senſuality in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that Chaſtity, the daughter of the Church by Poverty, was exiled: ſhe tried, but in vain, to gain protection in Italy and France. Her ſucceſs was equally bad in England. She ſtrove to take refuge in the court of Scotland: but they drove her from the court to the clergy. The biſhops were alarmed at her appearance, and proteſted they would harbour no rebel to the See of Rome. They ſent her to the nuns, who received her in form, with proceſſions and other honours. But news being immediately diſpatched to Senſuality and Riches, of her friendly reception among the nuns, ſhe was again compelled to turn fugitive. She next fled to the mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant friers, who declared they could not take charge of ladies. At laſt ſhe was found ſecreted in the nunnery of the Burrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor near Edinburgh, where ſhe had met her mother Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and her ſiſter Devotion. Senſuality attempts to beſiege
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0373500102:329"/>
this religious houſe, but without effect. The pious ſiſters were armed at all points, and kept an irreſiſtible piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, called <hi>Domine cuſtodi nos.</hi>

            <p>Other parts of Europe, from the ſame ſituations in life, afford inſtances of the ſame practice. Froiſſart has left a long narrative of an eminent robber, one Amergot Marcell; who became at length ſo formidable and powerful, as to claim a place in the hiſtory of France. About the year 1380, he had occupied a ſtrong caſtle for the ſpace of ten years, in the province of Auvergne, in which he lived with the ſplendor and dominion of a petty ſovereign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> having amaſſed, by pillaging the neighbouring country, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand francs. His depredations brought in an annual revenue of twenty thouſand floreins. Afterwards he
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0373500102:339"/>
is tempted imprudently to ſell his caſtle to one of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the king for a conſiderable ſum. Froiſſart introduces Marcell, after having ſold his fortreſs, uttering the following lamentation, which ſtrongly paints his ſyſtem of depredation, the feudal anarchy, and the trade and travelling of thoſe days. <q rend="inline">"What a joy was it when we rode forthe at adventure, and ſomtyme found by the way a ryche priour, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt, or a route of mulettes, of Montpellyer, of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, of Lymons, of Fongans, of Tholous, or of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſone, laden with clothe of Bruſſelles, or peltre ware comynge from the fayres, or laden with ſpycery from Bruges, from Damas, or from Alyſaunder! What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we met, all was ours, or els raunſomed at our pleaſures.

We were ever furnyſhed, as though we had been kings. Whan we rode forthe, all the country trembled for feare. All was oures, goynge or comynge. Howe toke we Carlaſte, I and the Bourge of Companye! and I and Perot of Bernoys toke Caluſet. How dyd we ſcale with lytell ayde the ſtronge caſtell of Marquell pertayninge to the erle Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyn! I kept it not paſt fyve dayes, but I receyved for it, on a fayre table, fyve thouſand frankes; and forgave one thouſand, for the love of the erle Dolphyn's chyldren.

I take this opportunity of obſerving, that the old Scotch poet Blind Harry belongs to this period; and, at the ſame time, of correcting the miſtake, which, in conformity to the common opinion, and on the evidence of Dempſter and Mackenzie, I have committed, in placing him towards the cloſe of the fourteenth century <note n="a" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. i. p. 321. Dempſter ſays he lived in 1361.</note>. John Major the Scotch hiſtorian, who was born about the year 1470, remembered Blind Harry to have been living, and to have publiſhed a poem on the achievements of Sir William Wallace, when he was a boy. He adds, that he cannot vouch for the credibility of thoſe tales which the bards were accuſtomed to ſing for hire in the caſtles of the nobility <note n="b" place="bottom">The poem as now extant has probably been reformed and moderniſed.</note>. I will give his own words. <q rend="inline">"Integrum librum Gulielmi Wallacei Henricus, a nativitate luminibus captus, meae infantiae tempore cudit: et quae vulgo dicebantur carmine vulgari, in quo peritus erat, conſcripſit.

            <p>I cannot return to the Engliſh poets without a hint, that a well-executed hiſtory of the Scotch poetry from the thirteenth century, would be a valuable acceſſion to the general literary hiſtory of Britain. The ſubject is pregnant with much curious and inſtructive information, is highly deſerving of a minute and regular reſearch, has never yet been uniformly examined in its full extent, and the materials are both acceſſible and ample. Even the bare lives of the vernacular poets of Scotland

have never yet been written with tolerable care; and at preſent are only known from the meagre outlines of Dempſter and Mackenzie. The Scotch appear to have had an early propenſity to theatrical repreſentations; and it is probable, that in the proſecution of ſuch a deſign, among ſeveral other intereſting and unexpected diſcoveries, many anecdotes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to illuſtrate the riſe and progreſs of our ancient drama, might be drawn from obſcurity.</p>

            <p>MOST of the poems of John Skelton were written in the reign of king Henry the eighth. But as he was laureated at Oxford about the year 1489 <note n="e" place="bottom">See ſupr. p. 130.</note>, I conſider him as belonging to the fifteenth century.</p>
            <p>Skelton, having ſtudied in both our univerſities, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the rectory of Diſs in Norfolk <note n="f" place="bottom">

            <p>Skelton was patroniſed by Henry Algernoon Percy, the fifth earl of Northumberland, who deſerves particular notice here; as he loved literature at a time when many of the nobility of England could hardly read or write their names, and was the general patron of ſuch genius as his age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. He encouraged Skelton, almoſt the only profeſſed poet of the reign of Henry the ſeventh, to write an elegy on the death of his father, which is yet extant. But ſtill ſtronger proofs of his literary turn, eſpecially of his ſingular paſſion for poetry, may be collected from a very ſplendid manuſcript, which formerly belonged to this very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed peer, and is at preſent preſerved in the Britiſh Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum <note n="k" place="bottom">MSS. Reg. 18 D. 11.</note>. It contains a large collection of Engliſh poems, elegantly engroſſed on vellum, and ſuperbly illuminated, which had been thus ſumptuouſly tranſcribed for his uſe. The pieces are chiefly thoſe of Lydgate, after which follow the aforeſaid Elegy of Skelton, and ſome ſmaller compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Among the latter are a metrical hiſtory of the family of Percy, preſented to him by one of his own chaplains; and a prolix ſeries of poetical inſcriptions, which he cauſed to be written on the walls and ceilings of the principal apartments of his caſtles of Lekinfield and Wreſſil <note n="l" place="bottom">

Titus and Geſippus were famous for their friendſhip; and their hiſtory forms an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting novel in Boccacio, the ſubſtance of which is this. Geſippus, falling into poverty, thought himſelf deſpiſed by Titus; and thence growing weary of life, gave out that he was guilty of a murther juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But Titus knowing the true ſtate of the caſe, and deſiring to ſave the life of his friend by loſing his own, charged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the murther: at which the real murtherer, who ſtood among the croud at the trial, was ſo ſtruck, that he confeſſed the fact. All three are ſaved; and Titus, to repair the broken fortunes of Geſippus, gives him his ſiſter in marriage, with an ample dower. Bocc. DECAM. Nov. viii. GIORN. x.

            <p>It is in vain to apologiſe for the coarſeneſs, obſcenity, and ſcurrility of Skelton, by ſaying that his poetry is tinctured with the manners of his age. Skelton would have been a writer without decorum at any period. The manners of Chaucer's age were undoubtedly more rough and unpoliſhed than thoſe of the reign of Henry the ſeventh. Yet Chaucer, a poet abounding in humour, and often employed in deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vices and follies of the world, writes with a degree of delicacy, when compared with Skelton. That Skelton's manner is groſs and illiberal, was the opinion of his cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries; at leaſt of thoſe critics who lived but a few years afterwards, and while his poems yet continued in vogue. Puttenham, the author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE, publiſhed in the year 1589, ſpeaking of the ſpecies of ſhort metre uſed in the minſtrel-romances, for the convenience of being ſung to the harp at feaſts, and in CAROLS and ROUNDS, <q rend="inline">"and ſuch other light or laſcivious poems which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more commodiouſly uttered by thoſe buffoons or Vices in playes than by any other perſon,"</q> and in which the ſudden return of the rhyme fatigues the ear, immediately ſubjoins: <q rend="inline">"Such were the rimes of Skelton, being indeed but a rude rayling rimer, and all his doings ridiculous; he uſed both ſhort diſtaunces and ſhort meaſures, pleaſing only the popular care <note n="o" place="bottom">Lib. ii. ch. ix. p. 69.</note>."</q> And Meres, in his PALLADIS

               </gap>kelton's characteriſtic vein of humour is capricious and groteſque. If his whimſical extravagancies ever move our laughter, at the ſame time they ſhock our ſenſibility. His feſtive levities are not only vulgar and indelicate, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently want truth and propriety. His ſubjects are often as ridiculous as his metre: but he ſometimes debaſes his matter by his verſification. On the whole, his genius ſeems better ſuited to low burleſque, than to liberal and manly ſatire. It is ſuppoſed by Caxton, that he improved our language; but he ſometimes affects obſcurity, and ſometimes adopts the moſt familiar phraſeology of the common people.</p>
            <p>He thus deſcribes, in the BOKE OF COLIN CLOUTE, the pompous houſes of the clergy.</p>

Roſſe of Warwick, who wrote about the year 1460, relates, that he ſaw in the abbat's hall at ſaint Alban's abbey a ſuite of arras, containing a long train of incidents belonging to a moſt romantic and pathetic ſtory in the life of the Saxon king Offa, which that hiſtorian recites at large <note n="u" place="bottom">

            <p>About the year 1512, Martin Coccaie of Mantua, whoſe true name was Theophilo Folengio, a Benedictine monk of Caſino in Italy, wrote a poem entitled PHANTASIAE MACA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RONICAE, divided into twenty-five parts. This is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque Latin poem, in heroic metre, checquered with Italian and Tuſcan words, and thoſe of the plebeian character, yet not deſtitute of proſodical harmony.

We muſt, however, acknowledge, that Skelton, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ſcurrility, was a claſſical ſcholar; and in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, he was tutor to prince Henry, afterwards king Henry the eighth: at whoſe acceſſion to the throne, he was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the royal orator.

James ſays, that Golias was not a name adopted by Mapes: but that there was a real wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that name, a collection of whoſe works he had ſeen. See MSS. [Bibl. Bodl.] JAMES, i. p. 320. Golias and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes appear to have been cotemporaries, and of a ſimilar genius. The curious reader will find many extracts from their poetry, which has very great merit in its way, among James's manuſcript collections. The facility of theſe old Latin rhymers is amazing: and they have a degree of humour and elegance far exceeding their age.</note>, than to copy the elegancies of Ovid, he would have appeared among the firſt writers of Latin poetry in England at the general reſtoration of literature.

            <p>I cannot quit Skelton, of whom I yet fear too much has been already ſaid, without reſtoring to the public notice a play, or MORALITY, written by him, not recited in any catalogue of his works, or annals of Engliſh typography; and, I believe, at preſent totally unknown to the antiquarians in this ſort of literature.

The priſoners, as we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are found guilty, and ordered into hell immediately. There is no ſort of propriety in calling this play the Necromancer:

for the only buſineſs and uſe of this character, is to open the ſubject in a long prologue, to evoke the devil, and ſummon the court. The devil kicks the necromancer, for waking him ſo ſoon in the morning: a proof, that this drama was performed in the morning, perhaps in the chapel of the palace.

England <note n="h" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. i. p. 279.</note>. The merchants, who frequented theſe fairs in numerous caravans or companies, employed every art to draw the people together. They were therefore accompanied by juglers, minſtrels, and buffoons; who were no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in giving their attendance, and exerting all their ſkill, on theſe occaſions. As now but few large towns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, no public ſpectacles or popular amuſements were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and as the ſedentary pleaſures of domeſtic life and private ſociety were yet unknown, the fair-time was the ſeaſon for diverſion. In proportion as theſe ſhews were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and encouraged, they began to be ſet off with new decorations and improvements: and the arts of buffoonery being rendered ſtill more attractive by extending their circle of exhibition, acquired an importance in the eyes of the people. By degrees the clergy, obſerving that the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of dancing, muſic, and mimicry, exhibited at theſe protracted annual celebrities, made the people leſs religious, by promoting idleneſs and a love of feſtivity, proſcribed theſe ſports, and excommunicated the performers.

            <p>Voltaire's theory on this ſubject is alſo very ingenious, and quite new. Religious plays, he ſuppoſes, came originally from Conſtantinople; where the old Grecian ſtage continued to flouriſh in ſome degree, and the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides were repreſented, till the fourth century. About that period, Gregory Nazianzen, an archbiſhop, a poet, and one of the fathers of the church, baniſhed pagan plays from the ſtage at Conſtantinople, and introduced ſelect ſtories from the old and new Teſtament. As the antient Greek tragedy was a religious ſpectacle, a tranſition was made on the ſame plan; and the choruſſes were turned into Chriſtian hymns <note n="l" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. i. p. 244.</note>. Gregory wrote many ſacred dramas for this purpoſe, which have not ſurvived thoſe inimitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions over which they triumphed for a time: one, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his tragedy called <gap reason="foreign">

ſpiritual dramas, in which at firſt a due degree of method and decorum was preſerved, was at length adopted from Conſtantinople by the Italians; who framed, in the depth of the dark ages, on this foundation, that barbarous ſpecies of theatrical repreſentation called MYSTERIES, or ſacred come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and which were ſoon afterwards received in France <note n="n" place="bottom">Hiſt.

                  </gap>.</note>. This opinion will acquire probability, if we conſider the early commercial intercouſe between Italy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople: and although the Italians, at the time when they may be ſuppoſed to have imported plays of this nature, did not underſtand the Greek language, yet they could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and conſequently could imitate, what they ſaw.</p>
            <p>In defence of Voltaire's hypotheſis it may be further obſerved, that the FEAST OF FOOLS and of the Ass, with other religious farces of that ſort, ſo common in Europe, originated at Conſtantinople. They were inſtituted, although perhaps under other names, in the Greek church, about the year 990, by Theophylact, patriarch of Conſtantinople, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably with a better deſign than is imagined by the eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical annaliſts; that of weaning the minds of the people from the pagan ceremonies, particularly the Bacchanalian and calendary ſolemnities, by the ſubſtitution of chriſtian ſpectacles, partaking of the ſame ſpirit of licentiouſneſs.

            <p>I muſt however obſerve here, what perhaps did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately occur to our lively philoſopher on this occaſion, that in the fourth century it was cuſtomary to make chriſtian parodies and imitations in Greek, of the beſt Greek claſſics, for the uſe of the chriſtian ſchools.

Apollinaris biſhop of Laodicea, abovementioned, wrote Greek tragedies, adapted to the ſtage, on moſt of the grand events recorded in the old Teſtament, after the manner of Euripides. On ſome of the familiar and domeſtic ſtories of ſcripture, he compoſed comedies in imitation of Menander. He wrote chriſtian odes on the plan of Pindar. In imitation of Homer, he wrote an heroic poem on the hiſtory of the bible, as far as the reign of Saul, in twenty-four books <note n="q" place="bottom">Sozomen (ubi infra) ſays, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled a ſyſtem of grammar, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But I muſt not omit a much earlier and more ſingular ſpecimen of a theatrical repreſentation of ſacred hiſtory, than this mentioned by Voltaire. Some fragments of an antient Jewiſh play on the EXODUS, or the Departure of the Iſraelites from Egypt under their leader and prophet Moſes, are yet preſerved in Greek iambics <note n="s" place="bottom">In Clemens Alexandrin. lib. i. STROM. p. 344. ſeq. Euſebius, PRAEPARAT. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANG. c. xxviii. xxix. Euſtathius ad HEX. p. 25. They are collected, and tranſlated into Latin, with emendations, by Fr.

The principal characters of this drama are Moſes, Sapphora, and God from the Buſh, or God ſpeaking from the burning buſh. Moſes delivers the prologue, or introduction, in a ſpeech of ſixty lines, and his rod is turned into a ſerpent on the ſtage. The author
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0373500102:378"/>
of this piece is Ezekiel, a Jew, who is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or the tragic poet of the Jews <note n="t" place="bottom">See Scaliger, ad EUSEB. p. 401.</note>. The learned Huetius endeavours to prove, that Ezekiel wrote at leaſt before the chriſtian era <note n="u" place="bottom">DEMOMSTRAT. EVANGELIC. p. 99.</note>. Some ſuppoſe that he was one of the ſeventy, or ſeptuagint, interpreters of the bible under the reign of Ptolomy Philadelphus. I am of opinion, that Ezekiel compoſed this play after the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and even in the time of Barocbas, as a political ſpectacle, with a view to animate his dejected countrymen with the hopes of a future deliverance from their captivity under the conduct of a new Moſes, like that from the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſervitude <note n="w" place="bottom">See Le Moyne, OBS. ad VAR. SACR. tom. i. pag. 336.</note>. Whether a theatre ſubſiſted among the Jews, who by their peculiar ſituation and circumſtances were prevented from keeping pace with their neighbours in the culture of the ſocial and elegant arts, is a curious ſpeculation. It ſeems moſt probable, on the whole, that this drama was compoſed in imitation of the Grecian ſtage, at the cloſe of the ſecond century, after the Jews had been diſperſed, and intermixed with other nations.</p>
            <p>Boileau ſeems to think, that the antient PILGRIMAGES introduced theſe ſacred exhibitions into France.</p>

The pilgrims who returned from Jeruſalem, ſaint James of Compoſtella, ſaint Baume of Provence, ſaint Reine, Mount ſaint Michael, Notre dame du Puy, and other places eſteemed holy, compoſed ſongs on their adventures; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing recitals of paſſages in the life of Chriſt, deſcriptions of his crucifixion, of the day of judgement, of miracles, and martyrdoms. To theſe tales, which were recommended by a pathetic chant and a variety of geſticulations, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the multitude gave the name of Viſions. Theſe pious itinerants travelled in companies; and taking their ſtations in the moſt public ſtreets, and ſinging with their ſtaves in their hands, and their hats and mantles fantaſtically adorned with ſhells and emblems painted in various colours, formed a ſort of theatrical ſpectacle. At length their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances excited the charity and compaſſion of ſome citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Paris; who erected a theatre, in which they might exhibit their religious ſtories in a more commodious and advantageous manner, with the addition of ſcenery and other decorations. At length profeſſed practitioners in the hiſtrionic art were hired to perform theſe ſolemn mockeries of religion, which ſoon became the principal public amuſement of a devout but undiſcerning people.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who are accuſtomed to contemplate the great picture of human follies, which the unpoliſhed ages of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope hold up to our view, it will not appear ſurpriſing, that the people, who were forbidden to read the events of the ſacred hiſtory in the bible, in which they were faithfully and beautifully related, ſhould at the ſame time be permitted to ſee them repreſented on the ſtage, diſgraced with the groſſeſt improprieties, corrupted with inventions and additions of

            <p>On the whole, the MYSTERIES appear to have originated among the eccleſiaſtics; and were moſt probably firſt acted, at leaſt with any degree of form, by the monks.

The oldeſt notice I can recover of this ſort of ſpectacle in an Engliſh univerſity, is in the fragment of an antient accompt-roll of the diſſolved college of Michael-houſe in Cambridge: in which, under the year 1386, the following expence is entered. <q rend="inline">"<hi>Pro ly pallio bruſdato et pro ſex larvis et barbis in comedia.</hi>"</q> That is, for an embroidered pall, or cloak, and ſix viſors and ſix beards, for the comedy <note n="m" place="bottom">Inter MSS.

At length our univerſities adopted the repreſentation of plays, in which the ſcholars by frequent exerciſe had undoubtedly attained a conſiderable degree of ſkill and addreſs, as a part of the entertainment at the reception of princes and other eminent perſonages. In the year 1566, queen Elizabeth viſited the univerſity of Oxford. In the magnificent hall of the college of Chriſt Church, ſhe was entertained with a Latin comedy

When the play was over, ſhe ſummoned the poet into her preſence, whom ſhe loaded with thanks and compliments: and at the ſame time turning to her levee, remarked, that Palamon was ſo juſtly drawn as a lover, that he certainly muſt have been in love indeed: that Arcite was a <hi>right martial knight, having a ſwart and manly countenance,</hi> yet with the aſpect of a Venus clad in armour: that the lovely Emilia was a virgin of uncorrupted purity and unblemiſhed ſimplicity, and that although ſhe ſung ſo ſweetly, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered flowers alone in the garden, ſhe preſerved her chaſtity undeflowered. The part of Emilia, the only female part in the play, was acted by a boy of fourteen years of age, a ſon of the dean of Chriſt-Church, habited like a young princeſs; whoſe performance ſo captivated her majeſty, that ſhe gave him a preſent of eight guineas <note n="w" place="bottom">This youth had before been introduced to the queen's notice, in her privy chamber at her lodgings at Chriſt-Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The firſt play, during this ſolemnity, was a paſtoral comedy called ALBA: in which five men, almoſt naked, appearing on the ſtage as part of the repreſentation, gave great offence to the queen and the maids of honour: while the king, whoſe delicacy was not eaſily ſhocked at other times, concurred with the ladies, and availing himſelf of this lucky circumſtance, peeviſhly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his wiſhes to depart, before the piece was half finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="f" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 637.</note>.

            <p>In tracing the hiſtory of our ſtage, this early practice of performing plays in ſchools and univerſities has never been conſidered, as a circumſtance inſtrumental to the growth and improvement of the drama. While the people were amuſed with Skelton's TRIAL OF SIMONY, Bale's GOD'S PROMISES, and CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO HELL, the ſcholars of the times were compoſing and acting plays on hiſtorical ſubjects, and in imitation of Plautus and Terence. Hence ideas of a legitimate fable muſt have been imperceptibly derived to the popular and vernacular drama. And we may add, while no ſettled or public theatres were known, and plays were chiefly acted by itinerant minſtrels in the halls of the nobility at Chriſtmas, theſe literary ſocieties ſupported ſome idea of a
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0373500102:395"/>
ſtage: they afforded the beſt accommodations for theatrical exhibition, and were almoſt the only, certainly the moſt rational, companies of players that exiſted.</p>

            <p>It is perhaps on this principle, that we are to account for plays being acted by ſinging-boys: although they perhaps acquired a turn for theatrical repreſentation and the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular arts, from their annual exhibition of the ceremonies of the boy-biſhop; which ſeem to have been common in almoſt every religious community that was capable of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a choir <note n="u" place="bottom">

I chuſe to give the deſcription in the words of this ſimple but pictureſque compiler. <q rend="inline">"There the queen had great entertainment, with banquets, eſpecially on Sunday night, made by the ſaid earl: together with a Maſk, and the warlike ſounds of drums and flutes, and all kinds of muſick, till midnight.

The children of the chapel-royal were alſo famous actors; and were formed into a company of players by queen Elizabeth, under the conduct of Richard Edwards, a muſician, and a writer of Interludes, already mentioned, and of whom more will be ſaid hereafter. All Lilly's plays, and many of Shakeſpeare's and Jonſon's, were originally performed by theſe boys <note n="c" place="bottom">Six of Lilly's nine comedies are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled COURT-COMEDIES: which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, were written profeſſedly for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

Lilly's court-comedies, and many others, were acted by the children of both choirs in conjunction.

               </gap> took its name, in the preſence of moſt of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom, in the years 1390, and 1409. In the ignorant ages, the pariſh-clerks of London might juſtly be conſidered as a literary ſociety. It was an eſſential part of their profeſſion, not only to ſing but to read; an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment almoſt ſolely confined to the clergy: and, on the whole, they ſeem to come under the character of a religious fraternity. They were incorporated into a guild, or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by king Henry the third about the year 1240, under the patronage of ſaint Nicholas. It was antiently cuſtomary for men and women of the firſt quality, eccleſiaſtics, and others, who were lovers of church-muſic, to be admitted into this corporation: and they gave large gratuities for the ſupport, or education, of many perſons in the practice of that ſcience. Their public feaſts, which I have already mentioned, were frequent, and celebrated with ſinging and muſic; moſt commonly at Guildhall chapel or college <note n="l" place="bottom">Stowe's SURV. LOND. ut ſupr. lib. v. p. 231.</note>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reformation, this ſociety was conſtantly hired to aſſiſt as a choir, at the magnificent funerals of the nobility, or other diſtinguiſhed perſonages, which were celebrated within the city of London, or in its neighbourhood. The ſplendid ceremonies of their anniverſary proceſſion and maſs, in the year 1554, are thus related by Strype, from an old chronicle. <q rend="inline">"May the ſixth, was a goodly evenſong at Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall college, by the Maſters of the CLARKS and their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, with ſinging and playing; and the morrow after, was a great maſs, at the ſame place, and by the ſame fraternity: when every clark offered an halfpenny. The maſs was ſung by diverſe of the queen's [Mary's] chapel and children. And after maſs done, every clark went their proceſſion, two and two together; each having on, a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice and a rich cope, and a garland. And then, fourſcore
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0373500102:403"/>
ſtandards, ſtreamers, and banners; and each one that bare them had an albe or a ſurplice. Then came in order the waits playing: and then, thirty clarkes, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing FESTA DIES. There were four of theſe choirs. Then came a canopy, borne over the Sacrament by four of the maſters of the clarkes, with ſtaffe torches burning, &amp;c <note n="m" place="bottom">ECCLES. MEM. vol. iii. ch. xiii. p. 121.</note>."</q> Their profeſſion, employment, and character, naturally dictated to this ſpiritual brotherhood the repreſentation of plays, eſpecially thoſe of the ſcriptural kind: and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice in ſhews, proceſſions, and vocal muſic, eaſily accounts for their addreſs in detaining the beſt company which England afforded in the fourteenth century, at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious farce, for more than a week.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this inquiry, a great part of which has been taken up in endeavouring to ſhew the connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween places of education and the ſtage, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the antient faſhion of acting plays in the inns of court, which may be ranked among ſeminaries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, although for a ſeparate profeſſion, is deducible from this ſource. The firſt repreſentation of this ſort which occurs on record, and is mentioned with any particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, was at Gray's-inn. John Roos, or Roo, ſtudent at Gray's-inn, and created a ſerjeant at law in the year 1511, wrote a comedy which was acted at Chriſtmas in the hall of that ſociety, in the year 1527. This piece, which probably contained ſome free reflections on the pomp of the clergy, gave ſuch offence to cardinal Wolſey, that the author was degraded and impriſoned <note n="n" place="bottom">Hollinſh. CHRON. iii. 894.</note>. In the year 1550, under the reign of Edward the ſixth, an order was made in the ſame ſociety, that no comedies, commonly called Interludes, ſhould be acted in the refectory in the intervals of vacation, except at the celebration of Chriſtmas: and that then, the whole body of ſtudents ſhould jointly contribute towards the dreſſes,

In the year 1561, Sackville's and Norton's tragedy of FERREX AND PORREX was preſented before queen Elizabeth at Whitehall, by the gentlemen of the Inner Temple <note n="p" place="bottom">Printed at London, 1565. 12mo.

In the year 1566, the SUPPOSES, a comedy, was acted at Gray's-inn, written by Gaſcoigne, one of the ſtudents. Dekker, in his ſatire againſt Jonſon above cited, accuſes Jonſon for having ſtolen ſome jokes from the Chriſtmas plays of the lawyers. <q rend="inline">"You ſhall ſweare not to bumbaſt out a new play with the old lyning of jeſtes ſtolne from the Temple-revells <note n="q" place="bottom">SATIROMASTIX, edit. 1602. ut ſupr.

The maſque with which his majeſty returned this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment on the ſhrove-tueſday following at Whitehall, was, I think, Carew's COELUM BRITANNICUM, written by the king's command, and played by his majeſty, with many of the nobility and their ſons who were boys.

            <p>In praiſe of this ſong it will be ſufficient to ſay, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds us of ſome favorite touches in Milton's COMUS, to which it perhaps gave birth. Indeed one cannot help ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving here in general, although the obſervation more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to another place, that a maſque thus recently exhibited on the ſtory of Circe, which there is reaſon to think had acquired ſome popularity, ſuggeſted to Milton the hint of a maſque on the ſtory of Comus. It would be ſuperfluous to point out minutely the abſolute ſimilarity of the two cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: they both deal in incantations conducted by the ſame mode of operation, and producing effects exactly parallel.</p>
            <p>From this practice of performing interludes in the inns of court, we may explain a paſſage in Shakeſpeare: but the preſent eſtabliſhment of the context embarraſſes that expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as it perplexes the ſentence in other reſpects.

            <p>WE are now arrived at the commencement of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century. But before I proceed to a formal and particular examination of the poetry of that century, and of thoſe that follow, ſome preliminary conſiderations of a more general nature, and which will have a reference to all the remaining part of our hiſtory, for the purpoſe of preparing the reader, and facilitating our future inquiries, appear to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>On a retroſpect of the fifteenth century, we find much poetry written during the latter part of that period. It is certain, that the recent introduction into England of the art of typography, to which our countrymen afforded the moſt liberal encouragement, and which for many years was almoſt ſolely confined to the impreſſion of Engliſh books, the faſhion of tranſlating the claſſics from French verſions, the growing improvements of the Engliſh language, and the diffuſion of learning among the laity, greatly contributed to multiply Engliſh compoſition, both in proſe and verſe. Theſe cauſes, however, were yet immature; nor had they gathered a ſufficient degree of power and ſtability, to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on our literature with any vigorous effects.</p>
            <p>But there is a circumſtance, which, among ſome others already ſuggeſted, impeded that progreſſion in our poetry, which might yet have been expected under all theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. A revolution, the moſt fortunate and important in moſt other reſpects, and the moſt intereſting that occur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the hiſtory of the migration of letters, now began to take place; which, by diverting the attention of ingenious men to new modes of thinking, and the culture of new lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, introduced a new courſe of ſtudy, and gave a temporary
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0373500102:414"/>
check to vernacular compoſition. This was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of claſſical learning.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of theſe annals we muſt have frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, from time to time, ſtriking ſymptoms of a reſtleſs diſpoſition in the human mind to rouſe from its lethargic ſtate, and to break the bonds of barbariſm. After many imperfect and interrupted efforts, this mighty deliverance, in which the mouldering Gothic fabrics of falſe religion and falſe philoſophy fell together, was not effectually completed till the cloſe of the fifteenth century. An event, almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous and unexpected, gave a direction to that ſpirit of curioſity and diſcovery, which had not yet appeared in its full force and extent, for want of an object. About the year 1453, the diſperſion of the Greeks, after Conſtantinople had been occupied by the Turks, became the means of gratifying that natural love of novelty, which has ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently led the way to the nobleſt improvements, by the introduction of a new language and new books<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and totally changed the ſtate of letters in Europe <note n="l" place="bottom">But it ſhould be remembered, that ſome learned Grecians, foreſeeing the perſecutions impending over their country, frequented Italy, and taught their language there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the taking of Conſtantinople.

In the year 1401, the Greek emperor, unable to reſiſt the frequent inſults of theſe barbarians, came into England to ſeek redreſs or protection from Henry the fourth. He landed at Dover, attended by many learned Greeks; and the next day was honourably received at Chriſt-church priory at Canterbury, by the prior, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Chyllenden.

            <p>This great change commenced in Italy; a country, from many circumſtances, above all others peculiarly qualified and prepared to adopt ſuch a deviation. Italy, during the darkeſt periods of monaſtic ignorance, had always maintained a greater degree of refinement and knowledge than any other European country. In the thirteenth century, when the manners of Europe appear to have been overwhelmed with every ſpecies of abſurdity, its luxuries were leſs ſavage, and its public ſpectacles more rational, than thoſe of France,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0373500102:415"/>
England, and Germany. Its inhabitants were not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, but enlightened, by that flouriſhing ſtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which its commodious ſituation, aided by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of other concomitant advantages, contributed to ſupport. Even from the time of the irruptions of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern barbarians, ſome glimmerings of the antient erudition ſtill remained in this country; and in the midſt of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and falſe philoſophy, repeated efforts were made in Italy to reſtore the Roman claſſics.

The many monuments of legitimate ſculpture and architecture preſerved in Italy, had there kept alive ideas of elegance and grace; and the Italians, from their familiarity with thoſe precious remains of antiquity, ſo early as the cloſe of the fourteenth century, had laid the rudiments of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the antient arts.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aring the way for this change, and which deſerves particular attention, was the innovation introduced into the Italian poetry by Petrarch: who, inſpired with the moſt elegant of paſſions, and cloathing his exalted feelings on that delicate ſubject in the moſt melodious and brilliant Italian verſification, had totally eclipſed the barbarous
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0373500102:416"/>
beauties of the Provencial troubadours; and by this new and powerful magic, had in an eminent degree contributed to reclaim, at leaſt for a time, the public taſte, from a love of Gothic manners and romantic imagery.</p>
            <p>In this country, ſo happily calculated for their favourable reception, the learned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ugitives of Greece, when their empire was now deſtroyed, found ſhelter and protection. Hither they imported, and here they interpreted, their antient writers, which had been preſerved entire at Conſtantinople. Theſe being eagerly ſtudied by the beſt Italian ſcholars, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated a taſte for the graces of genuine poetry and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and at the ſame time were inſtrumental in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating a more juſt and general reliſh for the Roman poets, orators, and hiſtorians. In the mean time a more elegant and ſublime philoſophy was adopted: a philoſophy more friendly to works of taſte and imagination, and more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſort of reading which was now gaining ground. The ſcholaſtic ſubtleties, and the captious logic of Ariſtotle, were aboliſhed for the mild and divine wiſdom of Plato.</p>
            <p>It was a circumſtance, which gave the greateſt ſplendour and importance to this new mode of erudition, that it was encouraged by the popes: who, conſidering the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of literature as a new expedient to eſtabliſh their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the minds of men, and enjoying an opulent and peaceable dominion in the voluptuous region of Italy, extended their patronage on this occaſion with a liberality ſo generous and unreſerved, that the court of Rome on a ſudden loſt its auſtere character, and became the ſeat of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and urbanity.

It is obvious to obſerve, how little conformable, this juſt taſte, theſe elegant arts, and theſe new amuſements, proved in their conſequences to the ſpirit of the papal ſyſtem: and it is remarkable, that the court of Rome, whoſe ſole deſign and intereſt it had been for ſo many centuries, to enſlave the minds of men, ſhould be the firſt to reſtore the religious and intellectual liberties of Europe. The apoſtolical fathers, aiming at a fatal and ill-timed popularity, did not reflect, that they were ſhaking the throne, which they thus adorned.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe who diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the exerciſe of theſe ſtudies, the firſt and moſt numerous were the Italian eccleſiaſtics. If not from principles of inclination, and a natural impulſe to follow the paſſion of the times, it was at leaſt their intereſt, to concur in forwarding thoſe improvements, which were commended, countenanced, and authoriſed, by their ſpiritual ſovereign: they abandoned the pedantries of a barbarous theology, and cultivated the pureſt models of antiquity. The cardinals and biſhops of Italy compoſed Latin verſes, and with a ſucceſs attained by none in more recent times, in imitation of Lucretius, Catullus, and Virgil. Nor would the encouragement of any other European potentate have availed ſo much, in this great work of reſtoring literature: as no other patronage could have operated with ſo powerful and immediate an influence on that order of men, who, from the nature of their education and profeſſion, muſt always be the principal inſtruments in ſupporting every ſpecies of liberal erudition.</p>
            <p>And here we cannot but obſerve the neceſſary connection between literary compoſition and the arts of deſign. No ſooner had Italy baniſhed the Gothic ſtyle in eloquence and poetry, than painting, ſculpture, and architecture, at the ſame time, and in the ſame country, arrived at maturity, and appeared in all their original ſplendour. The beautiful or ſublime ideas which the Italian artiſts had conceived from the contemplation of antient ſtatues and antient temples,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0373500102:419"/>
were invigorated by the deſcriptions of Homer and Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Petrarch was crowned in the capitol, and Raphael was promoted to the dignity of a cardinal.</p>
            <p>Theſe improvements were ſoon received in other countries. Laſcaris, one of the moſt learned of the Conſtantinopolitan exiles, was invited into France by Lewis the twelfth, and Francis the firſt: and it was under the latter of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch that he was employed to form a library at Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau, and to introduce Greek profeſſors into the univerſity of Paris <note n="t" place="bottom">Du Breul, ANTIQUITEZ de Paris, liv. ii. 1639. 4to. p. 563.

But although theſe gleams of ſcience long ſtruggled with the ſcholaſtic cloud which inveloped our univerſities, we find the culture of the claſſics embraced in England much ſooner than is ſuppoſed.

ſhort compaſs ſhews Becket's private ideas concerning the bigottries and ſuperſtitious abſurdities of his religion. The writer gives an account of a dinner in Becket's palace; at which was preſent, among many other prelates, a Ciſtercian abbot. This abbot engroſſed almoſt the whole converſation, in relating the miracles performed by Robert, the founder of his order. Becket heard him for ſome time with a patient contempt; and at length could not help breaking out with no ſmall degree of indignation, <hi>And theſe are your miracles!</hi>

            <p>We muſt however view the liberal ideas of theſe enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened dignitaries of the twelfth century under ſome reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It muſt be acknowledged, that their literature was clogged with pedantry, and depreſſed by the narrow notions of the times. Their writings ſhew, that they knew not how to imitate the beauties of the antient claſſics. Exulting in an excluſive privilege, the certainly did not ſee the ſolid and popular uſe of theſe ſtudies: at leaſt they did not chuſe, or would not venture, to communicate them to the people, who on the other hand were not prepared to receive them. Any attempts of that kind, for want of aſſiſtances which did not then exiſt, muſt have been premature; and theſe lights were too feeble to diſſipate the univerſal darkneſs. The writers who firſt appeared after Rome was ravaged by the Goths, ſuch as Boethius, Prudentius, Oroſius, Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, and Sedulius, and who naturally, from that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and becauſe they were Chriſtians, came into vogue at that period, ſtill continued in the hands of common readers, and ſuperſeded the great originals. In the early ages of Chriſtianity a ſtrange opinion prevailed, in conformity to which Arnobius compoſed his celebrated book againſt the gentile ſuperſtitions, that pagan authors were calculated to corrupt the pure theology of the goſpel. The prejudice however remained, when even the ſuſpicions of the danger were removed. But I return to the progreſs of modern letters in the fifteenth century.</p>

There is an anecdote on record, which ſtrongly marks Wolſey's character in this point of view. Notwithſtanding his habits of pomp, he once condeſcended to be a ſpectator of a Latin tragedy of DIDO, from Virgil, acted by the ſcholars of ſaint Paul's ſchool, and written by John Rightwiſe, the maſter, an eminent grammarian <note n="l" place="bottom">Wood, Ath.

this philological eſtabliſhment may juſtly be looked upon, as the firſt conſpicuous inſtance of an attempt to depart from the narrow plan of education, which had hitherto been held ſacred in the univerſities of England.

And it is at the ſame time worthy of remark, that this liberal prelate, in forming his plan of ſtudy, does not appoint a philoſophy-lecturer in his college, as had been the conſtant practice in moſt of the previous foundations: perhaps ſuſpecting, that ſuch an endowment would not have coincided with his new courſe of erudition, and would have only ſerved to encourage that ſpecies of doctrine, which had ſo long choaked the paths of ſcience, and obſtructed the progreſs of uſeful knowledge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Even the public diverſions of the court took a tincture from this growing attention to the languages, and aſſumed a claſſical air.

And when the French ambaſſadors with a moſt ſplendid ſuite of the French nobility were in England for the ratification of peace in the year 1514, amid the moſt magnificent banquets, tournaments, and maſques, exhibited at the ſame palace, they were entertained with a Latin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude; or, to uſe the words of a cotemporary writer, with ſuch an <q rend="inline">"excellent Interlude made in Latin, that I never heard the like; the actors apparel being ſo gorgious, and of ſuch ſtrange devices, that it paſſes my capacitie to relate them <note n="c" place="bottom">Cavendiſh, MEM.

            <p>Nor was the protection of king Henry the eighth, who notwithſtanding he had attacked the opinions of Luther, yet, from his natural livelineſs of temper and a love of novelty, thought favourably of the new improvements, of inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able influence in ſupporting the reſtoration of the Greek language. In 1519, a preacher at the public church of the univerſity of Oxford, harangued with much violence, and in the true ſpirit of the antient orthodoxy, againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines inculcated by the new profeſſors: and his arguments were canvaſſed among the ſtudents with the greateſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity. But Henry, being reſident at the neighbouring royal manor of Woodſtock, and having received a juſt detail of the merits of this diſpute from Pace and More, interpoſed his uncontrovertible authority; and tranſmitting a royal mandate to the univerſity, commanded that the ſtudy of the ſcriptures in their original languages ſhould not only be permitted for the future, but received as a branch of the academical inſtitution <note n="d" place="bottom">Eraſm.

The king, when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ended, to which he had liſtened with a ſmile of contempt, ordered a ſolemn diſputation to be held, in his own preſence: at which the unfortunate preacher oppoſed, and ſir Thomas More, with his uſual dexterity, defended, the utility and excellence of the Greek language. The divine, who at leaſt was a good courtier, inſtead of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his opinion, inſtantly fell on his knees, and begged pardon for having given any offence in the pulpit before his majeſty. However, after ſome ſlight altercation, the preacher, by way of making ſome ſort of conceſſion in form, ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly declared, that he was now better reconciled to the Greek tongue, becauſe it was derived from the Hebrew. The king, aſtoniſhed at his ridiculous ignorance, diſmiſſed the chaplain, with a charge, that he ſhould never again preſume to preach at court <note n="e" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 408.</note>.

began to be cultivated by the more ingenious clergy. Colet, dean of ſaint Paul's, a divine of profound learning, with a view to adorn and improve the ſtyle of his diſcourſes, and to acquire the graces of an elegant preacher, employed much time in reading Gower, Chaucer, and Lydgate, and other Engliſh poets, whoſe compoſitions had embelliſhed the popular diction <note n="h" place="bottom">Eraſm. EPISTOL. Jodoco Jonae. Ibid. Jun. 1521.</note>. The practice of frequenting Italy, for the purpoſe of acquiring the laſt poliſh to a Latin ſtyle both in eloquence and poetry, ſtill continued in vogue; and was greatly promoted by the connections, authority, and good taſte, of cardinal Pole, who conſtantly reſided at the court of Rome in a high character. At Oxford, in particular, theſe united endeavours for eſtabliſhing a new courſe of liberal and manly ſcience, were finally conſummated in the magnificent foundation of Wolſey's college, to which all the accompliſhed ſcholars of every country in Europe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited; and for whoſe library, tranſcripts of all the valuable manuſcripts which now fill the Vatican, were deſigned <note n="i" place="bottom">Wood, HIST. UNIV. OXON, i. 249.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the progreſs of theſe proſperous beginnings was ſoon obſtructed. The firſt obſtacle I ſhall mention, was, indeed, but of ſhort duration. It was however an unfavourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that in the midſt of this career of ſcience, Henry, who had ever been accuſtomed to gratify his paſſions at any rate, ſued for a divorce againſt his queen Catharine. The legality of this violent meaſure being agitated with much deliberation and ſolemnity, wholly engroſſed the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of many able philologiſts, whoſe genius and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were deſtined to a much nobler employment; and tended to revive for a time the frivolous ſubtleties of caſuiſtry and theology.</p>
            <p>But another cauſe which ſuſpended the progreſſion of theſe letters, of much more importance and extent, ultimately moſt
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:0373500102:448"/>
happy in its conſequences, remains to be mentioned. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged conceptions acquired by the ſtudy of the Greek and Roman writers ſeem to have reſtored to the human mind a free exertion of its native operations, and to have communicated a certain ſpirit of enterpriſe in examining every ſubject: and at length to have releaſed the intellectual capacity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from that habitual ſubjection, and that ſervility to ſyſtem, which had hitherto prevented it from advancing any new principle, or adopting any new opinion. Hence, under the concurrent aſſiſtance of a preparation of circumſtances, all centering in the ſame period, aroſe the reformation of religion. But this defection from the catholic communion, alienated the thoughts of the learned from thoſe purſuits by which it was produced; and diverted the ſtudies of the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed ſcholars, to inquiries into the practices and maxims of the primitive ages, the nature of civil and eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, the authority of ſcripture and tradition, of popes, councils, and ſchoolmen: topics, which men were not yet qualified to treat with any degree of penetration, and on which the ideas of the times unenlightened by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or warped by prejudice and paſſion, were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to throw juſt and rational illuſtrations. When the bonds of ſpiritual unity were once broken, this ſeparation from an eſtabliſhed faith ended in a variety of ſubordinate ſects, each of which called forth its reſpective champions into the field of religious contention. The ſeveral princes of chriſtendom were politically concerned in theſe diſputes; and the courts in which poets and orators had been recently careſſed and rewarded, were now filled with that moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſpecies of philoſophers, polemical metaphyſicians. The public entry of Luther into Worms, when he had been ſummoned before the diet of that city, was equally ſplendid with that of the emperor Charles the fifth <note n="k" place="bottom">Luther, Op. ii. 412. 414.</note>. Rome in return,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0373500102:449"/>
rouſed from her deep repoſe of ten centuries, was compelled to vindicate her inſulted doctrines with reaſoning and argument. The profound inveſtigations of Aquinas once more triumphed over the graces of the Ciceronian urbanity; and endleſs volumes were written on the expediency of auricular confeſſion, and the exiſtence of purgatory. Thus the cauſe of polite literature was for awhile abandoned; while the nobleſt abilities of Europe were waſted in theological ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and abſorbed in the abyſs of controverſy. Yet it muſt not be forgotten, that wit and raillery, drawn from the ſources of elegant erudition, were ſometimes applied, and with the greateſt ſucceſs, in this important diſpute. The lively colloquies of Eraſmus, which expoſed the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious practices of the papiſts, with much humour, and in pure Latinity, made more proteſtants than the ten tomes of John Calvin. A work of ridicule was now a new attempt: and it ſhould be here obſerved, to the honour of Eraſmus, that he was the firſt of the literary reformers who tried that ſpecies of compoſition, at leaſt with any degree of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity. The polite ſcholars of Italy had no notion that the German theologiſts were capable of making their readers laugh: they were now convinced of their miſtake, and ſoon found that the German pleaſantry prepared the way for a revolution, which proved of the moſt ſerious conſequence to Italy.</p>

In the year 1535, the king ordered lectures in humanity, inſtitutions which have their uſe for a time, and while the novelty laſts, to be founded in thoſe colleges of the univerſity, where they were yet wanting: and theſe injunctions were ſo warmly approved by the ſcholars in the largeſt ſocieties, that they ſeized on the venerable volumes of Duns Scotus and other irrefragable logicians, in which they had ſo long toiled without the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of knowledge, and tearing them in pieces, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed them in great triumph about their quadrangles, or gave them away as uſeleſs lumber <note n="d" place="bottom">See Dr. Layton's letter to Cromwell.

            <p>As all novelties are purſued to exceſs, and the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial improvements often introduce new inconveniencies, ſo this univerſal attention to polite literature deſtroyed philoſophy.
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0373500102:456"/>
The old philoſophy was aboliſhed, but a new one was not adopted in its ſtead. At Cambridge we now how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever find the antient ſcientific learning in ſome degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by the admiſſion of better ſyſtems.</p>
            <p>In the injunctions given by Henry to that univerſity in the year 1535, for the reformation of ſtudy, the dialectics of Rodolphus Agricola, the great favorite of Eraſmus, and the genuine logic of Ariſtotle, are preſcribed to be taught, inſtead of the barren problems of Scotus and Burlaeus <note n="g" place="bottom">Collier, ECCLES. HIST. vol. ii. p. 110.</note>. By the ſame edict, theology and cauſuiſtry were freed from many of their old incumbrances and perplexities: degrees in the canon law were forbidden; and heavy penalties were impoſed on thoſe academics, who relinquiſhed the ſacred text, to explain the tedious and unedifying commentaries on Peter Lombard's ſcholaſtic cyclopede of divinity, called the SENTENCES, which alone were ſufficient to conſtitute a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate library. Claſſical lectures were alſo directed, the ſtudy of words was enforced, and the books of Melancthon, and other ſolid and elegant writers of the reformed party, recommended. The politer ſtudies, ſoon afterwards, ſeem to have riſen into a flouriſhing ſtate at Cambridge. Biſhop Latimer complains, that there were now but few who ſtudied divinity in that univerſity <note n="h" place="bottom">SERMONS, &amp;c. p. 63. Lond. 1584. 4to.

            <p>It is generally believed, that the reformation of religion in England, the moſt happy and important event of our annals, was immediately ſucceeded by a flouriſhing ſtate of letters. But this was by no means the caſe. For a long time afterwards an effect quite contrary was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The reformation in England was completed under the reign of Edward the ſixth. The rapacious courtiers of this young prince were perpetually graſping at the rewards of literature; which being diſcouraged or deſpiſed by the rich, was neglected by thoſe of moderate fortunes. Avarice and zeal were at once gratified in robbing the clergy of their revenues, and in reducing the church to its primitive apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolical ſtate of purity and poverty <note n="n" place="bottom">See Collier's ECCL.

The miniſters of this abuſed monarch, by theſe arbitrary, diſhoneſt, and imprudent meaſures, only provided inſtruments, and furniſhed arguments, for reſtoring in the ſucceeding reign that ſuperſtitious religion, which they profeſſed to deſtroy. By thus impoveriſhing the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical dignities, they countenanced the clamours of the catholics; who declared, that the reformation was apparently founded on temporal views, and that the proteſtants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oppoſe the doctrines of the church, ſolely with a view that they might ſhare in the plunder of its revenues.

            <p>I muſt not, however, forget, as a remarkable ſymptom of an attempt now circulating to give a more general and unreſerved diffuſion of ſcience, that in this reign, Thomas Wilſon, originally a fellow of King's college in Cambridge, preceptor to Charles and Henry Brandon dukes of Suffolk, dean of Durham, and chief ſecretary to the king, publiſhed a ſyſtem a rhetoric and of logic, in Engliſh <note n="u" place="bottom">Firſt printed in the reign of Edward the ſixth.

an innovation almoſt equally daring with that of permitting the ſervice of the church to be celebrated in Engliſh: and accordingly the author, ſoon afterwards happening to viſit Rome, was incarcerated by the inquiſitors of the holy ſee, as a preſumptuous and dangerous heretic.</p>
            <p>It is with reluctance I enter on the bloody reign of the relentleſs and unamiable Mary; whoſe many dreadful mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms of men eminent for learning and piety, ſhock our ſenſibility with a double degree of horrour, in the preſent ſoftened ſtate of manners, at a period of ſociety when no po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is certain, that her reſtoration of popery, together with the monaſtic inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, its proper appendage, muſt have been highly perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the growth of polite erudition. Yet although the elegant ſtudies were now beginning to ſuffer a new relapſe, in the midſt of this reign, under the diſcouragement of all theſe inauſpicious and unfriendly circumſtances, a college was eſtabliſhed at Oxford, in the conſtitution of which, the founder principally inculcates the uſe and neceſſity of claſſical literature; and recommends it as the moſt important and leading object in that ſyſtem of academical ſtudy, which he preſcribes to the youth of the new ſociety <note n="w" place="bottom">In the year 1554.</note>.

In the beginning of the reign of queen Eliſabeth, which ſoon followed, when the return of proteſtantiſm might have been expected to produce a ſpeedy change for the better, puritaniſm began to prevail; and, as the firſt fervours of a new ſect are always violent, retarded for ſome time the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of ingenuous and uſeful knowledge. The ſcriptures being tranſlated into Engliſh, and every man aſſuming a right to dictate in matters of faith, and to chuſe his own principles, weak heads drew falſe concluſions, and erected an infinite variety of petty religions. Such is the abuſe which attends the beſt deſigns, that the meaneſt reader of the new Teſtament thought he had a full comprehenſion of the moſt myſterious metaphyſical doctrines in the chriſtian faith; and ſcorned to acquieſce in the ſober and rational ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſuch difficult ſubjects, which he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a competent and intelligent teacher, whom it was his duty to follow. The bulk of the people, who now poſſeſſed the means of diſcuſſing all theological topics, from their ſituation and circumſtances in life, were naturally averſe to the ſplendor, the dominion, and the opulence of an hierarchy, and diſclaimed the yoke of epiſcopal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The new deliverance from the numerous and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome ſuperſtitions of the papal communion, drove many pious reformers into the contrary extreme, and the rage of oppoſition ended in a devotion entirely ſpiritual and abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. External forms were aboliſhed, as impediments to the viſionary reveries of a mental intercourſe with heaven; and becauſe the church of Rome had carried ceremonies to an abſurd exceſs, the uſe of any ceremonies was deemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. The love of new doctrines and a new worſhip, the triumph of gaining proſelytes, and the perſecutions which accompanied theſe licentious zealots, all contributed to fan the flame of enthuſiaſm. The genius of this refined and falſe ſpecies of religion, which defied the ſalutary checks of all human authority, when operating in its full force,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:0373500102:464"/>
was attended with conſequences not leſs pernicious to ſociety, although leſs likely to laſt, than thoſe which flowed from the eſtabliſhment of the antient ſuperſtitions. During this unſettled ſtate of things, the Engliſh reformed clergy who had fled into Germany from the menaces of queen Mary, returned home in great numbers: and in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſufferings and learning, and their abilities to vindicate the principles of a national church erected in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that of Rome, many of them were preferred to biſhopricks, and other eminent eccleſiaſtical ſtations. Theſe divines brought back with them into England thoſe narrow principles concerning church-government and ceremonies, which they had imbibed in the petty ſtates and republics abroad, where the Calviniſtic diſcipline was adopted, and where they had lived like a ſociety of philoſophers; but which were totally inconſiſtent with the nature of a more extended church, eſtabliſhed in a great and magnificent nation, and requiring an uniform ſyſtem of policy, a regular ſubordination of officers, a ſolemnity of public worſhip, and an obſervance of exterior inſtitutions. They were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in the preſent circumſtances, thought to be the moſt proper inſtruments to be employed at the head of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs; not only for the purpoſe of vindicating the new eſtabliſhment by argument and authority, but of eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every trace of the papal corruptions by their practice and example, and of effectually fixing the reformation em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the church of England on a durable baſis. But, unfortunately, this meaſure, ſpecious and expedient as it appeared at firſt, tended to deſtroy that conſtitution which it was deſigned to ſupport, and to counteract thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which had been implanted by Cranmer in the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſyſtem of our religion. Their reluctance or refuſal to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, in a variety of inſtances, to the eſtabliſhed ceremonies, and their refinements in theological diſcipline, filled the church with the moſt violent diviſions; and introduced endleſs
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0373500102:465"/>
intricate diſputations, not on fundamental doctrines of ſolid importance to the real intereſts of chriſtianity, but on poſitive points of idle and empty ſpeculation, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no elegance of compoſition, and calling forth no vigour of abilities, exerciſed the learning of the clergy in the moſt barbarous and barren field of controverſial divinity, and obſtructed every purſuit of polite or manly erudition. Even the conforming clergy, from their want of penetration, and from their attachment to authorities, contributed to protract theſe frivolous and unbecoming controverſies: for if, in their vindication of the ſacerdotal veſtments, and of the croſs of baptiſm, inſtead of arguing from the jews, the primitive chriſtians, the fathers, councils, and cuſtoms, they had only appealed to common ſenſe and the nature of things, the propriety and expediency of thoſe formalities would have been much more eaſily and more clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. To theſe inconveniencies we muſt add, that the common eccleſiaſtical preferments were ſo much diminiſhed by the ſeizure and alienation of impropriations, in the late depredations of the church, and which continued to be carried on with the ſame ſpirit of rapacity in the reign of Eliſabeth, that few perſons were regularly bred to the church, or, in other words, received a learned education. Hence, almoſt any that offered themſelves were, without diſtinction or examination, admitted to the ſacred function. Inſomuch, that in the year 1560, an injunction was directed to the biſhop of London from his metropolitan, requiring him to forbear ordaining any more artificers and other illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate perſons who exerciſed ſecular occupations <note n="i" place="bottom">Strype's GRINDAL.

               </gap>ere were only two divines, and thoſe of higher rank, the preſident of Magdalen college <note n="l" place="bottom">Doctor Lawrence Humphreys, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the laſt note. Of whom it will not be improper to obſerve further in this place, that about the year 1553, he wrote an <hi>Epiſtola de Grecis literis et Homeri lectione et imitatione ad praeſidem et ſocios collegii Magdalenae, Oxon.</hi> In the CORNUCOPIA of Hadrian Junius, Baſil. 1558. fol.</note>, and the dean of Chriſt Church, who were capable of preaching the public ſermons before the univerſity of Oxford <note n="m" place="bottom">Wood, ut ſupr. i. 285.</note>. I will mention one inſtance of the extreme ignorance of our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour clergy about the middle of the ſixteenth century. In the year 1570, Horne, biſhop of Wincheſter, enjoined the minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory, every week, one chapter of ſaint Paul's epiſtles in Latin: and this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable taſk, almoſt beneath the abilities of an ordinary ſchool-boy, was actually repeated by ſome of them, before the biſhop, dean, and prebendaries, at a public epiſcopal viſitation of that church <note n="n" place="bottom">Regiſtr. Horne, Epiſc. Winton. fol. 80. b.</note>. It is well known that a ſet of homilies was publiſhed to ſupply their incapacity in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſermons: but it ſhould be remembered, that one reaſon for preſcribing this authoriſed ſyſtem of doctrine, was to prevent preachers from diſturbing the peace of the church by diſſeminating their own novel and indigeſted opinions.</p>
            <p>The taſte for Latin compoſition in the reign of Eliſabeth, notwithſtanding it was faſhionable both to write and ſpeak in that language, was much worſe than in the reign of Henry the eighth, when juſter models were ſtudied, and when the novelty of claſſical literature excited a general emulation to imitate the Roman authors. The Latinity of Aſcham's proſe has little elegance. The verſification and phraſeology of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:0373500102:467"/>
Buchanan's Latin poetry are ſplendid and ſonorous, but not marked with the chaſte graces and ſimple ornaments of the Auguſtan age. One is ſurpriſed to find the learned arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Grindal, in the ſtatutes of a ſchool which he founded, and amply endowed, recommending ſuch barbarous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate claſſics as Palingenius, Sedulius, and Prudentius, to be taught in his new foundation <note n="o" place="bottom">Strype's GRINDAL. B. ii. ch. xvii. p. 312. This was in iu 1583.</note>. Theſe, indeed, were the claſſics of a reforming biſhop: but the well-meaning prelate would have contributed much more to the ſucceſs of his intended reformation, by directing books of better taſte and leſs piety. That claſſical literature, and the public inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of youth, were now in the loweſt ſtate, we may collect from a proviſion in archbiſhop Parker's foundation of three ſcholarſhips at Cambridge, in the year 1567. He orders that the ſcholars, who are appointed to be elected from three the moſt conſiderable ſchools in Kent and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, ſhall be <q rend="inline">"the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>apteſt</hi> ſchollers, well inſtructed in the grammar, and, <hi>if it may be,</hi> ſuch as <hi>can make a verſe</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="bottom">Blomefield's NORFOLK, ii. 224.</note>."</q> It became faſhionable in this reign to ſtudy Greek at court. The maids of honour indulged their ideas of ſentimental affection in the ſublime contemplations of Plato's Phaedo: and the queen, who underſtood Greek better than the canons of Windſor, and was certainly a much greater pedant than her ſucceſſor James the firſt, tranſlated Iſocrates <note n="q" place="bottom">Aſcham's SCHOLEMASTER, p. 19. b. edit. 1589.

But this paſſion for the Greek language ſoon ended where it began: nor do we find that it improved the national taſte, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the writings, of the age of Eliſabeth.</p>
            <p>All changes of rooted eſtabliſhments, eſpecially of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional religion, are attended with ſhocks and convulſions, unpropitious to the repoſe ſcience and ſtudy.

               </gap> had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, every ſpecies of uſeful and elegant knowledge recovered its ſtrength, and aroſe with new vigour. Acquiſitions, whether in theology or humanity, were no longer excluſively confined to the clergy: the laity eagerly embraced thoſe purſuits from which they had long been unjuſtly reſtrained: and, ſoon after the reign of Eliſabeth, men attained that ſtate of general improvement, and thoſe ſituations with reſpect to literature and life, in which they have ever ſince perſevered.</p>
            <p>But it remains to bring home, and to apply, this change in the ſentiments of mankind, to our main ſubject. The cuſtoms, inſtitutions, traditions, and religion, of the middle ages, were favorable to poetry. Their pageaunts, proceſſions, ſpectacles, and ceremonies, were friendly to imagery, to perſonification and allegory. Ignorance and ſuperſtition, ſo oppoſite to the real intereſts of human ſociety, are the parents of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The very devotion of the Gothic times was romantic. The catholic worſhip, beſides that its numerous exteriour appendages were of a pictureſque and even of a poetical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diſpoſed the mind to a ſtate of deception, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, or rather authoriſed, every ſpecies of credulity: its viſions, miracles, and legends, propagated a general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to the Marvellous, and ſtrengthened the belief of ſpectres, demons, witches, and incantations. Theſe illuſions were heightened by churches of a wonderful mechaniſm, and conſtructed on ſuch principles of inexplicable archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture as had a tendency to impreſs the ſoul with every falſe ſenſation of religious fear. The ſavage pomp and the capricious heroiſm of the baronial manners, were replete with incident, adventure, and enterpriſe: and the intractable genius of the feudal policy, held forth thoſe irregularities of conduct, diſcordancies of intereſt, and diſſimilarities of ſituation, that framed rich materials for the minſtrel-muſe. The tacit compact of faſhion, which promotes civility by
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:0373500102:469"/>
diffuſing habits of uniformity, and therefore deſtroys pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of character and ſituation, had not yet operated upon life: nor had domeſtic convenience aboliſhed unwieldy magnificence. Literature, and a better ſenſe of things, not only baniſhed theſe barbarities, but ſuperſeded the mode of compoſition which was formed upon them. Romantic poetry gave way to the force of reaſon and inquiry; as its own inchanted palaces and gardens inſtantaneouſly vaniſhed, when the chriſtian champion diſplayed the ſhield of truth, and baffled the charm of the necromancer. The ſtudy of the claſſics, together with a colder magic and a tamer my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology, introduced method into compoſition: and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ambition of rivalling thoſe new patterns of excellence, the faultleſs models of Greece and Rome, produced that bane of invention, IMITATION. Erudition was made to act upon genius. Fancy was weakened by reflection and philoſophy. The faſhion of treating every thing ſcientifically, applied ſpeculation and theory to the arts of writing. Judgment was advanced above imagination, and rules of criticiſm were eſtabliſhed. The brave eccentricities of original genius, and the daring hardineſs of native thought, were intimidated by metaphyſical ſentiments of perfection and refinement. Setting aſide the conſideration of the more ſolid advantages, which are obvious, and are not the diſtinct object of our contemplation at preſent, the lover of true poetry will aſk, what have we gained by this revolution? It may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, much good ſenſe, good taſte, and good criticiſm. But, in the mean time, we have loſt a ſet of manners, and a ſyſtem of machinery, more ſuitable to the purpoſes of poetry, than thoſe which have been adopted in their place. We have parted with extravagancies that are above propriety, with incredibilities that are more acceptable than truth, and with fictions that are more valuable than reality.</p>

From the ſecond part of the firſt French quotation which I have diſtinguiſhed by Italics, it appears, that Walter Mapes, a learned archdeacon in England, under the reign of king Henry the ſecond, wrote a French SANGREAL, which he tranſlated from Latin, by the command of that monarch.

                  <p>Pag. 357. l. 7. ADD this Note. <q rend="inline">"Boccacio's ſituations and incidents, reſpecting the lovers, are often inartificial and unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting. In the Italian poet, Emilia walking in the garden and ſinging, is ſeen and heard firſt by Arcite, who immediately calls Palamon. They are both equally, and at the ſame point of time, captivated with her beauty; yet without any expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of jealouſy, or appearance of rivalry. But in Chaucer's management of the commencement of this amour, Palamon by ſeeing Emilia firſt, acquires an advantage over Arcite, which ultimately renders the cataſtrophe more agreeable to poetical juſtice. It is an unnatural and unanimated picture which Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacio preſents, of the two young princes violently enamoured of the ſame object, and ſtill remaining in a ſtate of amity. In Chaucer, the quarrel between the two friends, the foundation of all the future beautiful diſtreſs of the piece, commences at this moment, and cauſes a converſation full of mutual rage and reſentment. This rapid tranſition from a friendſhip cemented by every tie, to the moſt implacable hoſtility, is on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not only highly natural, but produces a ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected change of circumſtances, which enlivens the detail, and is always intereſting. Even afterwards, when Arcite is releaſed from the priſon by Perithous, he embraces Palamon at parting. And in the fifth book of the THESEIDE, when Palamon goes armed to the grove in ſearch of Arcite, whom he finds
<pb facs="tcp:0373500102:504"/>
ſleeping, they meet on terms of much civility and friendſhip, and in all the mechanical formality of the manners of romance. In Chaucer, this dialogue has a very different caſt. Palamon at ſeeing Arcite, feels a <hi>colde ſwerde</hi> glide throughout his heart: he ſtarts from his ambuſcade, and inſtantly ſalutes Arcite with the appellation of <hi>falſe traitour.</hi> And although Boccacio has merit in diſcriminating the characters of the two princes, by giving Palamon the impetuoſity of Achilles, and Arcite the mildneſs of Hector; yet Arcite by Boccacio is here injudiciouſly repreſented as too moderate and pacific. In Chaucer he returns the ſalute with the ſame degree of indignation, draws his ſword, and defies Palamon to ſingle combat. So languid is Boccacio's plan of this amour, that Palamon does not begin to be jealous of Arcite, till he is informed in the priſon, that Arcite lived as a favorite ſervant with Theſeus in diſguiſe, yet known to Emilia. When the lovers ſee Emilia from the window of their tower, ſhe is ſuppoſed by Boccacio to obſerve them, and not to be diſpleaſed at their ſigns of admiration. This circumſtance is juſtly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chaucer, as quite unneceſſary; and not tending either to promote the preſent buſineſs, or to operate in any diſtant conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. On the whole, Chaucer has eminently ſhewn his good ſenſe and judgement in rejecting the ſuperfluities, and improving the general arrangement, of the ſtory. He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently corrects or ſoftens Boccacio's falſe manners: and it is with ſingular addreſs he has often abridged the Italian poet's oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious and pedantic parade of antient hiſtory and mythology.</q>

The editor of the CANTERBURY TALES informs me, that Boccacio himſelf, in his DECAMERON, has made the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mention of this poem as of the THESEIDA: although without acknowledging either for his own. In the Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Sixth Day, he ſays, that <q rend="inline">"Dioneo inſieme con

Chaucer ſpeaks of himſelf as a tranſlator <hi>out of Latin,</hi> B. ii. 14. And he calls his author LOLLIUS, B. i. 394.—421. and B. v. 1652. The latter of theſe two paſſages is in the PHILOSTRATO: but the former, containing Petrarch's ſonnet, is not.

                     <q rend="inline">"The ingenious editor of the CANTERBURY TALES treats the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Chaucer imitated the Provencial poets, as totally void of foundation.

With reſpect to the manner and matter of his compoſitions, till ſome clear inſtance of imitation be produced, I ſhall be ſlow to believe, that in either he ever copied the poets of Provence; with whoſe works, I apprehend, he had very little, if any acquaintance."</q> Vol. i.

I have advanced the contrary doctrine, at leaſt by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and I here beg leave to explain myſelf on a ſubject ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially affecting the ſyſtem of criticiſm that has been formed on Chaucer's works. I have never affirmed, that Chaucer imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Provencial bards; although it is by no means impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he might have known their tales. But as the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar nature of the Provencial poetry entered deeply into the ſubſtance, caſt, and character, of ſome of thoſe French and Italian models, which he is allowed to have followed, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may be ſaid to have copied, although not immediately, the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of theſe writers. I have called his HOUSE OF FAME originally a Provencial compoſition. I did not mean that it was written by a Provencial troubadour: but that Chaucer's original was compounded of the capricious mode of fabling, and that extravagant ſtyle of fiction, which conſtitute the eſſence of the Provencial poetry. As to the
<pb facs="tcp:0373500102:517"/>
FLOURE AND THE LEAFE, which Dryden pronounces to have been compoſed <hi>after their manner,</hi> it is framed on the old allegoriſing ſpirit of the Provencial writers, refined and disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by the fopperies of the French poets in the fourteenth century. The ideas of theſe fablers had been ſo ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed, that they continued to operate long after Petrarch had introduced a more rational method of compoſition.</q>

But the CINQUANTE BALADES, or fifty French Sonnets abovementioned, are the curious and valuable part of lord Gower's manuſcript. They are not mentioned by thoſe who have written the life of this poet, or have catalogued his works. Nor do they appear in any other manuſcript of Gower which I have examined. But if they ſhould be diſcovered in any other, I will venture to pronounce, that a more authentic, unembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, and practicable copy than this before us, will not be produced: although it is for the moſt part unpointed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured with abbreviations, and with thoſe miſpellings which flowed from a ſcribe unacquainted with the French language.</p>
               <p>To ſay no more, however, of the value which theſe little pieces may derive from being ſo ſcarce and ſo little known, they have much real and intrinſic merit. They are tender, pathetic, and poetical; and place our old poet Gower in a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous point of view than that in which he has hitherto been uſually ſeen. I know not if any even among the French poets themſelves, of this period, have left a ſet of more finiſhed ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: for they were probably written when Gower was a young man, about the year 1350. Nor had yet any Engliſh poet treated the paſſion of love with equal delic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cy of ſentiment, and elegance of compoſition. I will tranſcribe four of theſe balades as correctly and intelligibly as I am able: although I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, there are ſome lines which I do not exactly comprehend.</p>

To the end of the Section, ADD, <q rend="inline">"What is here ſaid of Rowlie, was not only written, but printed, almoſt two years before the correct and complete edition of his Poems ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Had I been appriſed of that publication, I ſhould have been much more ſparing in my ſpecimens of theſe forgeries, which had been communicated to me in manuſcript, and which I imagined I was imparting to my readers as curioſities. I had as yet ſeen only a few extracts of theſe poems; nor were thoſe tranſcripts which I received, always exact. Circumſtances which I mention here, to ſhew the inconveniencies under which I laboured, both with regard to my citations and my criticiſms. Theſe ſcanty materials, however, contained ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence to convince me, that the pieces were not genuine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The entire and accurate collection of Rowlie's now laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the public, has been ſo little inſtrumental in inducing me to change my opinion, that it has ſerved to exemplify and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm every argument which I have produced in ſupport of my
<pb facs="tcp:0373500102:537"/>
ſuſpicions of an impoſition. It has likewiſe afforded ſome new proofs.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have been converſant in the works even of the beſt of our old Engliſh poets, well know, that one of their leading characteriſtics is inequality. In theſe writers, ſplendid deſcriptions, ornamental compariſons, poetical images, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoughts, occur but rarely: for many pages together, they are tedious, proſaic, and unintereſting. On the contrary, the poems before us are every where ſupported: they are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, poetical and animated. They have no imbecillities of ſtyle or ſentiment. Our old Engliſh bards abound in unnatural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, ſtrange imaginations, and even the moſt ridiculous abſurdities. But Rowlie's poems preſent us with no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous combinations, no mixture of manners, inſtitutions, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and characters. They appear to have been compoſed after ideas of diſcrimination had taken place; and when even common writers had begun to conceive, on moſt ſubjects, with preciſion and propriety. There are indeed, in the BATTLE OF HAST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS, ſome great anachroniſms; and practices are mentioned which did not exiſt till afterwards. But theſe are ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, as proceeded from fraud as well as ignorance: they are ſuch as no old poet could have poſſibly fallen into, and which only betray an unſkilful imitation of antient manners. The verſes of Lydgate and his immediate ſucceſſors are often rugged and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſical: but Rowlie's poetry ſuſtains one uniform tone of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and, if we bruſh away the aſperities of the antiquated ſpelling, conveys its cultivated imagery in a poliſhed and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtrain of verſification. Chatterton ſeems to have thought, that the diſtinction of old from modern poetry conſiſted only in the uſe of old words. In counterfeiting the coins of a rude age, he did not forget the uſual application of an artificial ruſt: but this diſguiſe was not ſufficient to conceal the elegance of the workmanſhip.</p>
               <p>The BATTLE OF HASTINGS, juſt mentioned, might be proved to be a palpable forgery for many other reaſons. It is
<pb facs="tcp:0373500102:538"/>
ſaid to be tranſlated from the Saxon of Turgot. But Turgot died in 1015, and the battle of Haſtings was fought in 1066. We will, however, allow, that Turgot lived in the reign of the Conqueror. But, on that ſuppoſition, is it not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that a cotemporary writer ſhould mention no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this action which we did not know before, and which are not to be found in Malmſbury, Ordericus Vitalis, and other antient chroniclers? Eſpecially as Turgot's deſcription of this battle was profeſſedly a detached and ſeparate performance, and at leaſt, on that account, would be minute and circumſtantial. An original and a cotemporary writer, deſcribing this battle, would not only have told us ſomething new, but would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been full of particularities. The poet before us dwells on incidents common to all battles, and ſuch as were eaſily to be had from Pope's HOMER. We may add, that this piece not only detects itſelf, but demonſtrates the ſpuriouſneſs of all the reſt. Chatterton himſelf allowed the firſt part of it to be a forgery of his own. The ſecond part, from what has been ſaid, could not be genuine. And he who could write the ſecond part was able to write every line in the whole collection. But while I am ſpeaking of this poem, I cannot help expoſing the futility of an argument which has been brought as a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive evidence of its originality. It is urged, that the names of the chiefs who accompanied the Conqueror, correſpond with the Roll of Battle-Abbey. As if a modern forger could not have ſeen this venerable record. But, unfortunately, it is printed in Hollinſhead's Chronicle.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that Chatterton, on account of his youth and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, could not write theſe poems. This may be true; but it is no proof that they are not forged. Who was their author, on the hypotheſis that Rowlie was not, is a new and another queſtion. I am, however, of opinion that it was Chatterton. For if we attend only to ſome of the pieces now extant in a periodical magazine, which he publiſhed under his own ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, and which are confeſſedly of his compoſition, to his
<pb facs="tcp:0373500102:539"/>
letters now remaining in manuſcript, and to the teſtimony of thoſe that were acquainted with his converſation, he will appear to have been a ſingular inſtance of a prematurity of abilities; to have acquired a ſtore of general information far exceeding his years, and to have poſſeſſed that comprehenſion of mind, and activity of underſtanding, which predominated over his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in life, and his opportunities of inſtruction. Some of his publications in the magazines diſcover alſo his propenſity to forgery, and more particularly in the walk of antient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which ſeem greatly to have ſtruck his imagination. Theſe, among others, are ETHELGAR, a <hi>Saxon poem</hi> in proſe; KENRICK, <hi>tranſlated from the Saxon;</hi> CERDICH, <hi>tranſlated from the Saxon;</hi> GODRED CROVAN, a Poem, <hi>compoſed by Doth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Syrric king of the iſle of Man;</hi> The HIRLAS, <hi>compoſed by Blythyn, prince of North Wales;</hi> GOTHMUND, <hi>tranſlated from the Saxon;</hi> ANECDOTE of CHAUCER, and of the ANTIQUITY of CHRISTMAS GAMES. The latter piece, in which he quotes a regiſter of Keinſham NUNNERY, which was a priory of Black canons, and advances many imaginary facts, ſtrongly ſhews his track of reading, and his fondneſs for antiquarian imagery. In this monthly collection he inſerted ideal drawings of ſix achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Saxon heraldry, of an inedited coin of queen Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgeo, wife of king Kinewalch, and of a Saxon amulet; with explanations equally fantaſtic and arbitrary. From Rowlie's pretended parchments he produced ſeveral heraldic delineations. He alſo exhibited a draught by Rowlie of Briſtol caſtle in its perfect ſtate. I very much doubt if this fortreſs was not almoſt totally ruinous in the reign of Edward the fourth. This draught, however, was that of an edifice evidently fictitious. It was exceedingly ingenious; but it was the repreſentation of a building which never exiſted, in a capricious and affected ſtyle of Gothic architecture, reducible to no period or ſyſtem.</p>
