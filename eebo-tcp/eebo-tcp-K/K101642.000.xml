            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—Stating that as we were the neareſt, and only male relations he had, to us he has taken the liberty of conſigning his remittances—with directions how he wiſhes them to be inveſted. Underſtanding that your reſidence in London was only caſual, and alſo thinking the trouble of buſineſs more ſuited to my time of life, he thought it better to addreſs his letter to me. In it, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains all the particulars of his marriage; and recommends his wife and daughter to our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
                  <p>No. His daughter we may hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect—Not being able to ſettle his affairs immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on the death of his father, he ſent her before him, unwilling to detain her from her mother.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, is the mother in England?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes;—and has been for ſeveral years. His marriage was without the conſent of his father, and, for ſome time, unknown to him—Enraged when he diſcovered it, he inſiſted on a ſeparation,—to avoid ruin, which would have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his father's reſentment, he was forced to comply. The child was ſuffered to remain with him—The wife was doom'd to return to England, where, for theſe fifteen years ſhe has lived in retirement.</p>

                  <p>They are recommended, it ſeems, to our attention; but, really, I don't well ſee how I can reconcile to myſelf, taking notice of, and introducing to my acquaintances, people, one doesn't know who—and that have been living one doesn't know where,</p>

wife and daughter of a nabob? Your high-bred friends will worſhip you for the introduction.

                  <speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
                  <p>You amaze me, child, that you don't extend your views—My ſon, the grandſon of the earl of Caſtlegreat, ought to aſpire to the proudeſt heireſſes of the nobleſt peers—not ſtoop to a thing of muſhroom growth.</p>

                  <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
                  <p>Then this glorious fortune may be mine. Invite them to your houſe. The mother having

long experienced a conſtrained ſecluſion from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, will, doubtleſs, be gratified with attentions from a woman of your rank—the daughter is young—I don't deſpair of ſucceſs with her; and the preference the father has ſhewn, in the truſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to me, makes me hope every thing from him. So, all ſeems fair for my ſucceſs; and half a million at leaſt is the prize. Think of that—think of that.</p>

                  <p>Why, yes, Sir; yes. You muſt know, Sir, that I am an old fellow that remember Mrs. Cleveland (Heaven bleſs her!) when ſhe was not the height of my knee. Often and often is the time that I have danced her o'top of it. Well, that is neither here nor there. When her father
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0778801500:10"/>
died—Ah! I ſhall never forget it—he has not left a better man behind him—there was not a dry eye in the village except the undertaker's, and folks do ſay he cried a bit. Well, her father, good ſoul! had met with ſo many loſſes and croſſes, that there was little enough left for his daughter to live like a lady on; ſo ſhe was perſuaded by her friends to take a voyage to India with a couſin of her's, who had married, and was going to ſettle there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. Cleveland has acquainted me with the reſt. There he married her, and from thence, by the ſeverity of his father, he was forced to ſend her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, poor dear! home ſhe came again, miſerable enough, to be ſure. Well, mayhap, all for the beſt; now ſhe will be as happy as the day is long. But for this many a year ſhe has led but a loneſome ſort of a life; for you may think my dame and I, though we love her like a child of our own, can't have been company good enough for her: but ſhe was as kind to us, and made as much of us, as though we had been the beſt people in the land.</p>

There vices were incurable, and they would have been as completely beggared by the ſkilful operations of others if all my thoughts had been engaged in the exerciſe of devotion, and my guineas appropriated to charitable donations—Nay, to preſerve my eſtimation with the world, I have raiſed from the earth thoſe whom others, leſs mindful of opinion, would have left groveling in miſery.—Pſha! when I ſcrutinize my conduct with an eye half inclined to condemnation, I find matter for praiſe inſtead of cenſure.

Ever after I panted for City honours—So, all my <hi>honeſt</hi> earnings I was determined to depoſit in trade. An opportunity ſoon offered—I was to become a ſleeping partner in a great houſe. I paid down my caſh to the laſt guinea—A docket was ſtruck againſt the firm the very next week, ſo the poor ſleeping partner had nothing but the open air for his ſlumbers; and, inſtead of being in the road to claim a ſeat at a Guildhall dinner, I had ſcarcely enough to purchaſe one in Porridge Iſland.</p>

                  <p>Yes; and I was in a very likely way to be adorned with an iron one;—but I was reſolved to take myſelf out of the reach of temptation and danger, by leaving London.</p>

                  <p>I came out in Richard the Third. I thought it deviliſh fine; but the good folks in the front thought otherwiſe. I ranted—they hooted—However, I out-roared them, and puſhed on till I got into Boſworth Field—"A horſe, a horſe! my kingdom for a horſe!" When a drunken, Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunting ſquire (I ſhall never loſe the ſound of his damn'd voice) bawled out of the boxes, that I ſhould have the beſt horſe in his ſtable, if I would ride away directly, and never come back again.</p>

                  <p>The actor's warn'd me it would not do. I thought it envy in them, and have ſome reaſon to think they ſent in a party to hiſs me. However, by way of comfort, they told me, though I ſhould never act tragedy, they thought I ſhould ſucceed in low comedy—Low comedy! only think of their impudence! Is this a face for low comedy? No, no, damn it! I could not ſtoop to that.</p>

                  <p>Oh, then I got a call, and mounted the habiliments in which you ſee me; this was lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; but my conſcience would not ſuffer me any longer to drain from the pockets of the poor, the earnings of their induſtry: nay, what is worſe, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter their innocent minds with groundleſs terrors, and inſpire them with prejudice againſt their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures.</p>

In a morning the faſhionable buſtle of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, the muſical thunder of a footman's rap—the dealing out tickets to the whole <hi>ton</hi>-world—and then at night, driving to twenty different aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies—ſeeing the whole world in the courſe of an evening—Oh, dear, dear, what a charming age to live in! we ſee more of life in one day, than our anceſtors did in their whole exiſtence.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Yes; but I doubt whether we are the happier for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Car.</speaker>
                  <p>To be ſure we are. What is all this but happineſs? care can never reach us, for in all this hurry nobody has time to think; and you know it is thinking makes one unhappy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I'm not Cynic enough to attempt to reaſon people out of their notions of happineſs; for as it exiſts in imagination, the idea is the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0778801500:22"/>
reality. But, my dear Caroline, I have told you my wiſh to be thought well of by this young Eaſt Indian. From living in the ſame houſe, and being nearly of an age, you will moſt likely contract a friendſhip.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Car.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; and her taking my brother for her lover, will be the beſt ſecurity for that friendſhip; for then, we can't be rivals—and nothing is ſo apt to make young ladies diſagree, as being both of the ſame mind.</p>

                  <p>No, no—Yes—one, mayhap—one may be alive—one ungracious boy—No, no; it be hardly poſſible, though there is a chance, a little chance—I have always kept a watch on the Old Bailey Seſſions Papers, and the County Aſſize liſts—and to be ſure I never found his name down in them; but there is little certainty or comfort in that—for you know, my poor wicked boy may have been hanged, or ſent to Botany Bay under ſome other name.</p>

                  <p>Yes—you muſt ſuppoſe I had his well doing at heart—and ſo I never ſpared him. I did hope, by good advice, and good example, and a good horſewhip, all together, to have made an honeſt man of him—But the rogue ſcampered away when he was but a younker, and ſo got looſe into the wide wicked world, with a bad diſpoſition, and neceſſity to whet it.

out, and in a moment throng'd. In one, leaſt crowded, was your father; he called to me, and earneſtly conjured me to come into it—As I was going to comply, I ſaw a poor old man kneeling to heaven to ſave him from the fate his feeble age denied him to contend againſt. The boat could ſafely hold but one—I placed him in it, ſeized on a friendly coop, and with it truſted to the waves.</p>

                  <p>I hope, Leonard, your own reflections will render that needleſs. Could you have fairly gained the girl's affections, I ſhould have rejoiced at your ſucceſs, and thought the ſociety of an amiable woman the likelieſt ſchool for forming an honeſt man; but force—to uſe force againſt a lovely, helpleſs female, none but a devil could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the thought, and none but devils could be found to execute it.</p>

                  <p>Well, ſir, take your courſe, but be cautious that you do not thwart me—Dare not to breathe a word of my deſigns, unleſs your devotion to your new tenets is warm enough to make you welcome a priſon in their defence. Mark me, a priſon. You may remember there are certain bonds of yours in my poſſeſſion that give me as entire a power over your perſon, as tho' you were my purchaſed ſlave.

            <byline>WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ. AND SPOKEN BY MRS. POPE.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>WELL, tho' our Bard has try'd his utmoſt art</l>
               <l>To ſhew how riches will pollute the heart,</l>
               <l>No doubt his labour has been all in vain,</l>
               <l>And poverty will ne'er one convert gain.</l>
               <l>How could the man attempt a taſk ſo bold!</l>
               <l>But what, forſooth, can authors know of gold?</l>
               <l>An ore that rarely darts on them a beam,</l>
               <l>Unleſs, perchance, in hope's deluſive dream;</l>
               <l>Hope, that miſleads them thro' life's weary way,</l>
               <l>And ſcarcely leaves at laſt the barren bay.</l>
               <l>What, wean the human heart from love of pelf!</l>
               <l>A toil, too hard for Hercules himſelf!</l>
               <l>Nay, that great hero, as we learn in ſtory,</l>
               <l>Strove for a little gain, as well as glory,</l>
               <l>Elſe why attack the dreadful ſcaly brute,</l>
               <l>If not to graſp the rich Heſperian fruit?</l>
               <l>Hence, av'rice is a paſſion not ſo odd,</l>
               <l>Since, as we find, it urg'd a demi-god.</l>
               <l>'Twas alſo ſaid of yore the female tribe,</l>
               <l>Are frail as men when tempted by a bribe,</l>
               <l>And mighty Jove, with all his boaſted pow'r</l>
               <l>Was forc'd to woo amid a golden ſhow'r.</l>
               <l>Oh! wond'rous charm of all-perſuaſive gold,</l>
               <l>That fires the timid, and ſubdues the bold.</l>
               <l>Gold, that can give the upſtart blockhead fame,</l>
               <l>And make a fawning world his wit proclaim;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0778801500:92"/>
That lends deformity reſiſtleſs grace,</l>
               <l>O'erthrows the mighty, and exalts the baſe;</l>
               <l>Great ſubſtitute for learning, genius, worth,</l>
               <l>Deſpotic ſovereign of adoring earth!</l>
               <l>But let me check the raſh injurious thought,</l>
               <l>For, in this court, no verdict can be bought.</l>
               <l>Here merit ſafely may aſſert her plea,</l>
               <l>While candour regulates the mild decree;</l>
               <l>And by that candour one who oft has try'd</l>
               <l>Its gen'rous force, his fate muſt now abide,</l>
               <l>In hopes one error more will pardon find,</l>
               <l>Since to his others you've ſo long been kind.</l>
