            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE preſent Volume pretends to no other
merit, than that of being a laborious ſelection
of the moſt intereſting parts of the various
ANA. To theſe valuable ſtores of Literature
I have added ſome Anecdotes, which appeared
to me amuſive and curious; and ſome Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
which, I hope, will not be deemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
            <p>The ANA form a body of Literature not
univerſally known. It may, therefore, be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to inform the reader, that in the early part
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1020400300:4"/>
of the laſt century, it was prevailing cuſtom
to take down for publication the Converſations,
or '<hi>Table-Talk,</hi>' as they have been ſometimes
called, of the moſt eminent Wits and Scholars.
To ſatisfy the demands of Famine, rather than
thoſe of Literature, ſome men were prompted to
ſell their Collections to the Bookſellers; and it
may be fairly preſumed, were leſs attentive
to the richneſs of the materials then to the
number of pages they were calculated to fill.
Others publiſhed them at the death of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
Friend, to diſplay the extent of his ſcience,
or the felicity of his genius; and it muſt be
confeſſed, that even theſe were not ſo ſcrupulous
as they ſhould have been of what they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into their Collections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1020400300:5"/>
Had ſuch Repoſitories of Literature been
judiciouſly formed, they would, have proved
a valuable acquiſition to the Republic
of Letters: but their reſpective Compilers
have evinced great inattention, or little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment;
nothing was diſcriminated in the
maſs of their materials; they appear to have
liſtened to the mouth of the Scholar whoſe
ſentiments they record, as the credulous Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt
did in ancient times to the Oracle he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.
Thus, whatever was unintelligible,
obſcure, or even falſe, was held by theſe Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Devotees in as great reverence as it's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite.</p>
            <p>It has been repeatedly urged, and allowed,
that the matter of elaborate Treatiſes, and even
ponderous Volumes, may not infrequently be
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1020400300:6"/>
comprized in conciſe Eſſays, or ſhort Remarks.
Some things of this kind are attempted in the
preſent Volume; and I have been prompted
towards it's publication, by a conviction that
it will furniſh much uſeful information to the
generality of readers.</p>
            <p>It is not juſt, however, that curioſity ſhould
be raiſed too high. If expectations are formed,
which are impoſſible to be gratified, abilities
infinitely ſuperior to mine muſt be humbled.
All the Anecdotes I offer will not be new: of
ſome, I pretend only to remind the reader; but
the greater part, I have frequently been tempted
to believe, will appear intereſting.</p>
            <p>The faſhionable and commercial world are
too much occupied to attend to ſerious diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and ſcientific reſearch: the one labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1020400300:7"/>
occupied in doing nothing, and the other
indefatigable in doing every thing. To the
literary labourer they leave the cultivation of
the fields and the gardens of Literature: they
are willing to purchaſe the productions of his
talents; but they expect to receive only the fruits
and the flowers. To ſuch, who form indeed the
generality of readers, it is preſumed, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Collection will not be found unuſeful.
Whatever is moſt intereſting in books rarely to
be met with, or whatever is moſt agreeable in
compilations which it would be impoſſible for
them to peruſe with patience, is here ſelected:
and, if it is not preſumptuous to add, the Man
of Letters, at the ſame time, may be reminded
of important Obſervations, ſtriking Anecdotes,
and attic Pleaſantries; which, however they
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1020400300:8"/>
deſerve to be retained, will, without ſome Vade
Mecum of this kind, ſoon eſcape from the
moſt tenacious memory. In a word, if this
Collection anſwers the hopes of the Editor,
it will be found a Miſcellany not unamuſive
to the Literary Lounger.</p>
            <p>As I have acknowledged that this Volume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
for the moſt part, only a Collection from
the Works of others, ſome Ariſtarchus may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaciouſly
diſcover, that it is not difficult to
make books in this manner. With this I
ſhall agree. But it will be admitted, that it
has coſt ſome care and ſome labour to collect
theſe materials. Should the uſeful and the
agreeable be found blended, I believe the
Public care little whether the Author has
written every ſentence himſelf; or, like me,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1020400300:9"/>
ſtands deeply indebted to the works of other
Writers.</p>
            <p>To improve an arrangement which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo perfect as I could wiſh, I have added a
copious INDEX: each Article alſo is titled, ſo
that wherever the book is opened, the ſubject
diſcuſſed immediately appears.</p>
            <p>To be uſeful, and to pleaſe the Public, is my
deſign. My Work is not adapted to extend,
or to beſtow, reputation: it is ſufficient, if it
attains it's humble pretenſion. A multifarious
Collection of this kind ſtands in great need of
Critical Candour: yet I ſhould feel myſelf
little ſolicitous concerning it's reception, if I
were certain that the urbanity of the Critic was
to dicide it's fate.</p>

The moſt valued of Gabriel Naudé's works
is his Apology for thoſe great Men who have
been accuſed of Magic. In that book, he has
recorded a melancholy number of the moſt
eminent ſcholars, who have found, that to have
been ſucceſsful in their ſtudies, was a ſucceſs
which harraſſed them with a continued perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
that ſometimes led them into the priſon,
and ſometimes bound them to the ſtake.</p>
               <p>Urbé Grandier, for whoſe life, replete with
intereſting anecdote, I refer the reader to
Bayle, was burnt alive through the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a rival, who formed a conſpiracy
againſt this amiable and unfortunate ſcholar,
by contriving to get the depoſitions of ſome
nuns to prove the crime of magic. Theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
muſt have been guilty of the moſt horrid
perjuries.</p>
               <p>Cornelius Agrippa was neceſſitated to fly his
country, and the enjoyments of a rich income,
merely for having diſplayed a few philoſophical
experiments which now every ſchool-boy can
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1020400300:16"/>
perform. The people beheld him as an object
of horror; and not infrequently, when he
walked the ſtreets, he found them empty at
his approach. He died, of diſeaſe and famine,
in an hoſpital.</p>
               <p>In the preſent day, when the lights of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
have become ſo generally expanded, we
perceive the little foundation of all theſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of magic. What a dreadful chain muſt
there have been of perjuries and conſpiracies!
One is willing to imagine, for the honour of
human nature, that ſo deep a malignity, and
ſo ſedate a cruelty, could not have tainted the
heart of men; but the ſimple recital of hiſtory
forms, too often, the ſevereſt ſatire on human
nature.</p>
               <p>Our great Roger Bacon, by a degree of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
which perhaps has never been equalled,
diſcovered ſome of the moſt occult ſecrets in
Nature. She ſeems, indeed—if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
myſelf—to have ſtood naked before him.
His honours have been ſtolen from him by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1020400300:17"/>
more modern authors, who have appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors
when they were copying Bacon. Yet,
for the reward of all his intenſe ſtudies, the
holy brethren, and the infallible Majeſty of
Rome, occaſioned him to languiſh in priſon
during the greater part of his life.</p>
               <p>The catalogue of the Perſecuted Learned is
indeed voluminous. We need not waſte our
tears on fictitious ſorrows, while the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of theſe men ſhall exiſt!</p>

               <head>FRIAR BACON.</head>
               <p>MY zeal for the memory of this illuſtrious
ſcholar impels me to tranſcribe, which it will
be found I ſeldom do, from a book that is in
every body's hands. From the faithful and
laborious Henry, have I collected what follows
concerning Roger Bacon—</p>
               <p>' We cannot but lament that Friar Bacon
met with ſo many diſcouragements in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of uſeful knowledge. If he had lived in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1020400300:18"/>
better times, or if he had even been permitted
to proſecute that courſe of enquiries and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
in which he engaged after his return
from Paris, it is highly probable that the world
would have many valuable diſcoveries that are
ſtill unknown.</p>
               <p>' An excellent modern writer, Dr. Friend,
having enumerated ſome of Bacon's diſcoveries,
adds—"Theſe are wonderful diſcoveries for a
man to make in ſo ignorant an age, who had
no maſter to teach him, but ſtruck it all out of
his own brain: but it is ſtill more wonderful
that ſuch diſcoveries ſhould lie ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed;
till, in the next ſucceeding centuries,
other people ſhould ſtart up, and lay claim to
thoſe very inventions to which Bacon alone
had a right."</p>
               <p>' Bacon diſcovered the art of making Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes,
the Camera Obſcura, Microſcopes,
Teleſcopes, and various other mathematical and
aſtronomical inſtruments. He diſcovered a
method of performing all the chymical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1020400300:19"/>
that are now in uſe. He combined the
mechanical powers in ſo wonderful a manner,
that it was for this he was accuſed of magic.
His diſcoveries in medicine were by no means
unimportant. That the ingredients of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
and the art of making it, were well
known to him, is now undeniable: but the
<hi>humane philoſopher,</hi> dreading the conſequences
of communicating this diſcovery to the world,
tranſpoſed the letters of the Latin words which
ſignify Charcoal, which made the whole obſcure.
It was done thus—<hi>Luru mope can vbre,</hi> (<hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonum
pulvere.</hi>) By this means he rendered it
difficult to diſcover this dangerous ſecret by the
peruſal of his works; and, at the ſame time,
ſecured to himſelf the honour of having known
it, by ſpecifying the other ingredients, if it
ſhould be diſcovered by any other perſon.
This accordingly happened after Bacon's
death; for, about the beginning of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
century, one Barthold Schwartz, a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
monk, and chymiſt, accidentally diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1020400300:20"/>
gunpowder, as he was pounding ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre,
ſulphur, and charcoal, in a mortar, for
ſome other purpoſe.'</p>
               <p>To this we may add, that the Chineſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
gunpowder in their wars; and were
familiar with the art of printing, probably,
ſome centuries before we made uſe of them in
Europe.</p>
               <p>Though Bacon is mentioned, in this artical,
as the inventor of optical glaſſes, Marville gives
a curious piece of information. He ſays, that
'it is generally known, that James Metius, a
Dutchman, invented, in 1609, <hi>ſpectacles</hi> and
<hi>teleſcopes</hi>; and that Galileo, being at Venice,
imitated as well as he could a teleſcope, and
aſtoniſhed the learned Venetians from the
tower of St. Mark with this novel invention.'
And he adds—'But there are <hi>few</hi> who know
that the <hi>principles</hi> of optics, on which teleſcopes
are formed, are to be found in <hi>Euclid,</hi> and in
the antient geometricians; and that it is through
want of reflection that this wonderful inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1020400300:21"/>
                  <hi>as well as many others,</hi> have remained ſo
long concealed in the majeſty of Nature, as
Pliny expreſſes it, till chance has drawn them
out.'</p>

               <head>THE RECOVERY OF MANUSCRIPTS.</head>
               <p>IT was a Florentine who found buried in a
heap of duſt, and in a rotten coffer belonging
to the monaſtery of Saint Gal, the works of
Quintilian; and, by this fortunate diſcovery,
gave them to the Republic of Letters.</p>
               <p>Papirius Maſſon found, in the houſe of a
book-binder of Lyons, the works of Agobart.
The mechanic was on the point of uſing the
manuſcripts to line the covers of his books.</p>
               <p>Raimond Soranzo, a celebrated lawyer in the
Papal Court at Avignon, about the middle of
the fourteenth century, had in his poſſeſſion the
two books of Cicero on Glory. He made a
preſent of them to Petrarch, who lent them to
an aged and poor man of letters, formerly his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1020400300:22"/>
preceptor. Urged by extreme poverty, the old

               <p>Leonard Aretin was one of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
ſcholars at the dawn of literature; but
he has done that which reflects on him great
diſhonour. He found a Greek manuſcript of
Procopius <hi>de Bello Gothico.</hi> This he tranſlated
into Latin, and publiſhed the work as his own.
Since, however, other manuſcripts of the ſame
work have been diſcovered; and the fraud of
Leonard Aretin is apparent.</p>
               <p>Machiavel acted more adroitly in a ſimilar
caſe. A manuſcript of the Apophthegms of the
Ancients, by Plutarch, having fallen into his
hands, he ſelected thoſe which pleaſed him,
and put them into the mouth of one of his
heroes.</p>
               <p>A page of the ſecond Decade of Livy was
found by a man of letters on the parchment of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1020400300:23"/>
his battledore, as he was amuſing himſelf in
the country. He ran directly to the maker of
the battledore: but arrived too late; the man
had finiſhed the laſt page of Livy, in compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a large order for theſe articles about a
week before.</p>
               <p>Sir Robert Cotton, being one day at his
tailor's, diſcovered that the man held in his
hand, ready to be cut up for meaſures, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Magna Charta, with all it's appendages of
ſeals and ſignatures. He bought this ſingular
curioſity for a trifle; and recovered, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
what had long been given over for loſt.—As this anecdote is entirely new to me, it may
be proper to point out that it is taken from
the Colomeſiana, page 186.</p>
               <p>Whether the Poems of Rowley be originals,
adulterations, or the compoſitions of Chatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
I do not venture to decide: this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is certain, that the finding them in the
worm-eaten cheſt, in the antient church at
Briſtol, has a very <hi>claſſical</hi> appearance, and is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1020400300:24"/>
undoubtedly in the nature of ſuch diſcoveries.
It is not probable—for he was, I believe, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the French language—that poor Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton,
like me, had laboured through all the
<hi>Ana,</hi> and caught the idea from their peruſal.</p>
               <p>We might be inclined to forgive a ſkilful
<hi>forgery</hi> of the two books of Cicero on Glory:
they muſt have been very important and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
for no man was more enthuſiaſtically
fond of glory than this orator. Petrarch ſpeaks

               </q>
               <p>THE greateſt authors of antiquity have
ſmarted under the laſh of Criticiſm. Chevrau
has collected a great number of inſtances. Leſt
I ſhould prove tedious, I only ſelect a few.</p>
               <p>It was given out, that Homer had ſtolen from
Heſiod whatever was moſt remarkable in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1020400300:25"/>
Iliad and Odyſſey. The Emperor Caligula
ſuppreſſed the works of this great poet; and
gave, for reaſon, that he certainly had as much
right as Plato, who had ſo ſeverely condemned
him.</p>
               <p>Sophocles was brought to trial by his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as a lunatic: and ſome, who blamed
the inequalities of this poet, have alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the vanity of Pindar; the hard and
rough verſes of Aeſchylus; and the manner in
which Euripides conducted his plots.</p>
               <p>Socrates, who has even been compared to
Jeſus Chriſt, as the wiſeſt and the moſt moral
of men, Cicero has treated as an uſurer, and
Athenaeus as an illiterate perſon. Mr. Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,
in one of his Obſervers, has induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
revived a calumny which moſt aſſuredly
only took it's riſe from the malignant buffoonery
of Ariſtophanes; who, as Jortin ſays, was a
great wit, but a great raſcal. Should ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
author draw his anecdotes from the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Foote, or of Peter Pindar, we know
well that he might delineate a ſpirited cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1020400300:26"/>
but nothing, at the ſame time, would
be more fictitious.</p>
               <p>Plato, who has been called, by Clement of
Alexandria, the Moſes of Athens; the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
of the Chriſtians, by Arnobius; and
the God of Philoſophers, by Cicero; has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
a variety of criticiſms. Athenaeus
accuſes him of envy; Theopompus, of lying;
Suidas, of avarice; Aulus Gellius, of robbery;
Porphyry, of incontinence; and Ariſtophanes,
of impiety.</p>
               <p>Ariſtotle, who according to ſome writers
has compoſed more than four hundred vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
and who for his work on animals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from Alexander eight hundred talents,
has not been leſs ſpared by the critics. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes
Laertius, Cicero, and Plutarch, have
forgotten nothing that can tend to ſhew his
ignorance, his ambition, and his vanity.</p>
               <p>If the reader does not feel himſelf weary, he
may read on.</p>
               <p>Virgil is deſtitute of invention, if we are to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1020400300:27"/>
give credit to Pliny, Carbilius, and Seneca.
Caligula has abſolutely denied him even medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity;
Herennus has marked his faults; and
Perilius Fauſtinus has furniſhed a thick vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
with his plagiariſms. Even the author of
his Apology has confeſſed, that he has ſtolen
from Homer his greateſt beauties.</p>
               <p>Horace cenſures the coarſe humour of Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;
and Horace, in his turn, has been blamed
for fiction and obſcurity.</p>
               <p>The majority of the critics regard Pliny's
Hiſtory only as a pleaſing romance; and
ſeem to have quite as little reſpect for Quintus
Curtius.</p>
               <p>Pliny cannot bear Diodorus and Vopiſcus;
and, in one comprehenſive criticiſm, treats all
the hiſtorians as narrators of fables.</p>
               <p>Livy has been reproached for his averſion
to the Gauls; Dion, for his hatred of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public;
Velleius Paterculus, for ſpeaking too
kindly of the vices of Tiberius; and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus
and Plutarch, for their exceſſive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1020400300:28"/>
to their own country. Others have
ſaid of Cicero, that there is no connection,
and, to adopt their own figure, no <hi>blood</hi> and
<hi>nerves,</hi> in what his admirers ſo warmly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol.
They ſay, he is cold in his extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
effuſions, too artificial in his exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums,
trifling in his ſtrained witticiſms, and
tireſome in his digreſſions.</p>
               <p>Quintilian does not ſpare Seneca; and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,
called by Cicero the Prince of
Orators, has, according to Hermippus, more of
art than of nature. To Demades, his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
appear too much laboured; others have
thought him too dry; and, if we may truſt
Eſchines, his language is by no means pure.</p>
               <p>Should we proceed with this liſt to our
own country, and our own times, it might be
curiouſly augmented; but, perhaps, enough has
been ſaid, to ſoothe irritated genius, and to ſhame
faſtidious criticiſm. 'I would beg the critics
to remember,' the Earl of Roſcommon writes,
in his Preface to his Verſion of Horace's Art
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1020400300:29"/>
of Poetry, 'that Horace owed his favour and
his fortune to the character given of him by
Virgil and Varius; that Fundanius and Pollio
are ſtill valued by what Horace ſays of them;
and that, in their Golden Age, there was a good
underſtanding among the ingenious, and thoſe
who were the moſt eſteemed were the beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured.'
I would hope, in ſpite of the daily
cries we hear from diſappointed writers, that
thoſe Journaliſts, whoſe ſtyle and ſentiments
render them reſpectable in the eyes of every
man of letters, maintain with rigid integrity
the fountains of criticiſm pure and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.
They cannot be inſenſible that their
volumes are not merely read, and then forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
but that they will remain as ſurviving

               <p>CARDINAL Perron, in the Perroniana, has
the following curious article of intelligence:
'In that part of Tartary which belongs to
the kingdom of Perſia there exiſts a flouriſhing
univerſity, where the Arabs cultivate literature.
Gioan Baptiſta Remondi, who was the firſt
who cauſed books in the Arabic language to
be printed in Europe, and who had even
ſtudied in this univerſity, has pretended to ſay,
that there were a number of Arabic books
tranſlated from many Greek authors who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unknown to the Europeans. It was the
Arabians who have preſerved a book of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes:
with many authors who have written

               <p>To this account may be added that which
Bell has given us in his Travels to Tartary.
It is—'That in Siberia there exiſts an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

ſcoured all Europe, and ſent out travellers to

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1020400300:33"/>
Paris a number of Arabic manuſcripts, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

               <p>A ſimilar impoſition was practiſed on the

long ardently deſired to inſpect it, as they
imagined it would contain many valuable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets

impoſtor having got an Ethiopic book into his

               <head>THE PORTRAITS OF AUTHORS.</head>
               <p>WITH the ancients, it was undoubtedly a
cuſtom to place the portraits of Authors
before their works. Martial will ſerve as a
teſtimony in this caſe. The hundred and
eighty-ſixth Epigram of his fourteenth Book
is a mere play on words, concerning a little
volume which contained the works of Virgil,
and which had his portrait prefixed to it. The
volume and the characters muſt have been
very diminutive. Antiquity records many ſuch
penmen, whoſe glory conſiſted in writing in
ſo ſmall a hand, that it was not legible to the
naked eye. One wrote a verſe of Homer on a
grain of millet; and another, more trifling
and indefatigable, tranſcribed the whole Iliad
in ſo conſined a ſpace, that it could be incloſed
in a nut ſhell. Menage ſays, that theſe things
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1020400300:37"/>
are not ſo improbable as they ſeem. This
trifling art is not loſt in modern times. He
ſays, he has read whole ſentences which were
not perceptible to the eye without the aſſiſtance
of the microſcope. He has even ſeen <hi>portraits</hi>
and <hi>pictures</hi> of the ſame kind; and, which
ſeems wonderful, what appeared lines and
ſcratches thrown down at random, were letters
in capitals: and the lineaments of Madame
la Dauphiné's face were preſerved with the
moſt pleaſing delicacy, and with correctneſs of
reſemblance. He read alſo an Italian poem,
in <hi>praiſe</hi> of this princeſs, which contained

               <p>Martial is not the only writer who takes
notice of the ancients prefixing their portraits
to their works. Seneca, in his ninth chapter

many of the luxurious great, who—like ſo

               <p>It was thus the art of criticiſm flouriſhed in

them with the beſt copies, or exerting
their own judgment and learning to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
of thoſe paſſages which were evidently
corrupt. At length, this avocation degenerated
into a low and obſcure ſtudy, the chief merit
of which conſiſted in the recovery and collation

topics, merely to convince us of their impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
but it ſhews a great defect in judgment
to be occupied on them in an advanced age.
'It is proper, however,' Fontenelle remarks,
'to apply one's ſelf to theſe enquiries; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we find, as we proceed, many valuable
diſcoveries of which we were before ignorant.'
The ſame thought Cowley has applied, in an
addreſs to his miſtreſs, thus—<q>
                     <l>Altho' I think thou never wilt be found,</l>
                     <l>Yet I'm reſolv'd to ſearch for thee:</l>
                     <l>The ſearch itſelf rewards the pains.</l>
                     <l>So, tho' the chymiſt his great ſecret miſs,</l>
                     <l>(For neither it in art nor nature is)</l>
                     <l>Yet things well worth his toil he gains;</l>
                     <l>And does his charge and labour pay</l>
                     <l>With good unſought experiments by the way.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame thought is in Donne. Perhaps
Cowley did not ſuſpect that he was an imitator.
What is certain, Fontenelle could not have
read either; and, perhaps, only ſtruck out the
thought by his own reflection.</p>

               <head>THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS.</head>
               <p>IN the preſent article, I am little more than
the tranſlator of the lively and ingenious Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neul
Marville.</p>
               <p>The Republic of Letters is of an ancient
date. It appears by the pillars Joſephus has
noticed, on which were engraven the principles
of the ſciences, that this republic exiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Deluge; at leaſt, it cannot be denied
that, ſoon after this great cataſtrophe, the
ſciences flouriſhed.</p>
               <p>Never was a republic greater, better peopled,
more free, or more glorious: it is ſpread on
the face of the earth, and is compoſed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of every nation, of every rank, of every
age, and of both ſexes. They are intimately
acquainted with every language, the dead as
well as the living. To the cultivation of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they join that of the arts; and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1020400300:46"/>
are alſo permitted to occupy a place.
But their religion cannot boaſt of uniformity;
and their manners, like thoſe of every other
republic, form a mixture of good and of evil:
they are ſometimes enthuſiaſtically pious, and
ſometimes inſanely impious.</p>
               <p>The politics of this ſtate conſiſt rather in
words, in vague maxims and ingenious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
than in actions, or their effects.
This people owe all their ſtrength to the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy
of their eloquence, and the ſolidity of
their arguments. Their trade is perfectly intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual,
and their riches very moderate; they
live in one continued ſtrife for glory and for
immortality. Their dreſs is by no means ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did;
yet they affect to deſpiſe thoſe who labour
through the impulſe of avarice or neceſſity.</p>
               <p>They are divided into many ſects, and they
ſeem to multiply every day. The ſtate is
ſhared between the Philoſophers, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
the Divines, the Lawyers, the Hiſtorians,
the Mathematicians, the Orators, the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1020400300:47"/>
and the Poets, who have each their
reſpective laws.</p>
               <p>Juſtice is adminiſtered by the Critics, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
with more ſeverity than juſtice. The
people groan under the tyranny of theſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
particularly when they are capricious
and viſionary. They reſcind, they eraſe, or
add, at their will and pleaſure, much in the
manner of the Grand Monarque—<hi>Car tel eſt
notre plaiſir</hi>; and no author can anſwer for his
fate, when once he is fairly in their hands.
Some of theſe are ſo unfortunate, that, through
the cruelty of the treatment they receive, they
loſe not only their temper, but their ſenſe and
wits.</p>
               <p>Shame is the great caſtigation of the guilty;
and to loſe one's reputation, among this people,
is to loſe one's life. There exiſt, however, but
too many impudent ſwindlers, who prey upon
the property of others; and many a vile ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
who ſnatches the bread from the hands of
men of merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1020400300:48"/>
The Public are the diſtributors of glory;
but, too often, the diſtribution is made with
blindneſs, or undiſcerning precipitation. It is
this which cauſes loud complaints, and excites
ſuch murmurs throughout the republic.</p>
               <p>The predominating vices of this ſtate are
preſumption, vanity, pride, jealouſy, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.
There is alſo a diſtemper peculiar to
the inhabitants, which is denominated <hi>hunger,</hi>
and which occaſions frequent deſolations
throughout the country.</p>
               <p>This republic, too, has the misfortune to
be infected with numerous Plagiariſts; a
ſpecies of banditti who rifle the paſſengers.
The corruptors of books, and the forgers, are
not leſs formidable; nor do there want im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors,
who form rhapſodies and beſtow pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
titles on unimportant trifles, who levy
heavy contributions on the public.</p>
               <p>There are alſo found an infinite number of
illuſtrious Idlers and Voluptuaries; who, only
ſeeking for thoſe volumes that afford amuſement,
draw all their ſubſiſtence from the ſtate, without
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1020400300:49"/>
contributing any thing either to it's advantage
or it's glory. There are alſo Miſanthropes,
born with an hatred of men: Pedants, who
are the terror of ſchoolboys, and the enemies
of urbanity and amiable manners.</p>
               <p>I will not notice the licentious Geniuſes of
the republic, who are in an eternal hoſtility of
ſentiments, and a warfare of diſputes; nor thoſe
faſtidious minds, who are too delicate not to
be offended every moment; nor thoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries,
who load their imagination with
crude and falſe ſyſtems.</p>
               <p>All theſe may be ſuppoſed to exiſt in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
ſo vaſt as that of Letters; where it is
permitted to every one to reſide, and to live
according to his own inclinations.</p>

               <head>ESDRAS.</head>
               <p>IT was Eſdras who wrote what is at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the Books of Moſes; which, as the
death of the latter is there mentioned, ſhews
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1020400300:50"/>
he could not have been the author. He, alſo,
at the return from the Babyloniſh captivity,
arranged into one body the Scriptures; and
many aſſure us, on the authority of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
that he corrected it in eighteen paſſages
which had been greatly altered and falſified. Is
there not reaſon to fear that he ſtill has left ſo
much to correct, that the body of writings, which
paſs under the name of the Holy Scriptures,
is little entitled to that ſacred appellation? It's
corruptions and errors are at leaſt evident.
Hobbes perfectly diſcredits Moſes being the
author of the Pentateuch, in his Leviathan.
It appears that Moſes delivered to Joſhua ſome
materials, which he depoſited in the ark; that
Joſhua gave them to the Judges or Elders; and
that, in the courſe of time, they took the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
in which they now appear.</p>
               <p>To this article we may add, that it is well
known to thoſe who are moſt intelligent in

loſt a book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
Judah; the third Epiſtle to the Corinthians;
and the third Epiſtle of Peter. Samuel wrote
a book on the Office and Inſtruction of a King;
Solomon compiled a work containing three

               <p>IT is in vain to account for the operations

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1020400300:54"/>
It's mutations, too, are wonderful. I am at
a loſs to account on what principles the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
inſtance took place. Vigneul Marville
ſupplies me with this anecdote—</p>
               <p>Brebeuf, when he was young, felt an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic
inclination for the works of Horace.
His friend Gautier, on the contrary, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with a taſte for Lucan. This preference
frequently occaſioned diſputes. To terminate
them, it was agreed that each of them ſhould
read the favourite poet of his friend; that they
ſhould examine with critical acumen, and decree
with candour. The conſequences are ſingular.
Gautier read Horace, became enamoured of his
verſes, and never after quitted them: while
Brebeuf was ſo charmed with Lucan, that he
grew intoxicated with the Pharſalia; and, in
tranſlating this epic, out-lucan'd Lucan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his bombaſtic and tumid verſes.</p>
               <p>That Gautier ſhould reject Lucan, after a
ſtudious peruſal of Horace, is not ſurprizing:
the wonder is, how Brebeuf could forget ſo
ſuddenly the graces and the rules of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1020400300:55"/>
Horace, to give into Lucan's corrupted
taſte.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke, in his elegant Eſſay on the
Sublime and Beautiful, ſays, that 'what is
called <hi>Taſte,</hi> in it's moſt general acceptation,
is not a ſimple idea, but is partly made up of
a perception of the primary pleaſures of ſenſe;
of the ſecondary pleaſures of the imagination;
and of the concluſions of the reaſoning faculty
concerning the various relations of theſe, and
concerning the human paſſions, manners, and
actions. All theſe are requiſite to form Taſte;
and the ground-work of all theſe is the ſame
in the human mind: for, as the ſenſes are
the great originals of all our ideas, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
of all our pleaſures, if they are not
uncertain and arbitrary, the whole ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of Taſte is common to all; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there is a ſufficient foundation for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
reaſoning for theſe matters.'</p>
               <p>In another place he obſerves—'<hi>Senſibility</hi>
and <hi>Judgment,</hi> which are the qualities that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1020400300:56"/>
compoſe what is commonly called a <hi>Taſte,</hi>
vary exceedingly in various people. From a
defect in the former of theſe qualities ariſes a
want of Taſte: a weakneſs in the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
a wrong or a bad one.'</p>
               <p>If this account is juſt, the ſenſibility and the
judgment of Brebeuf, of which the one was
ſo lively, and the other ſo vigorous, when in
his youthful days he was attached to Horace,
muſt have undergone a total change when he
became ſtudiouſly fond of Lucan. Yet this
is not to be conceived: for it is poſſible to
enlarge and to ſtrengthen our judgment; but,
ſurely, not to eradicate a correct one; at leaſt,
when a man is in the vigour of life and
health.</p>

Ever bold, yet moderate, chaſte, patient,

Yet he was ſo modeſt, that he affirmed he

was—that he was very ignorant. Such was his

future events. It was this deep foreſight into

               <p>THE origin of ſo many fables and intolerable
abſurdities, which have been entitled <hi>Legends,</hi>
ariſes from this circumſtance—</p>
               <p>Before any colleges were eſtabliſhed in the
monaſteries where the ſchools were held, the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1020400300:83"/>
profeſſors in rhetoric frequently gave their
ſcholars the life of ſome ſaint for a trial of their
talent at <hi>amplification.</hi> The ſtudents, being
conſtantly at a loſs to furniſh out their pages,
invented theſe wonderful adventures. The
good fathers of that age, whoſe ſimplicity was
not inferior to their devotion, were ſo delighted
with theſe flowers of rhetoric, that they were
induced to make a collection of theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
compoſitions; not imagining that, at
ſome diſtant period of time, they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
matters of faith. Yet, when James de
Voraigne, (Vicar-general of the Jacobins)
Peter Nadal, and Peter Ribadeneira, wrote the
Lives of the Saints, they ſought for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
in the libraries of the monaſteries; and,
awakening from the duſt theſe manuſcripts of
amplification, imagined they made an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
preſent to the world by laying before
them theſe bulky abſurdities. The people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them with all imaginable ſimplicity,
and, in the laſt century, it was dangerous
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1020400300:84"/>
for a man to dare even to ſuſpect the reality
of theſe pious fictions. We are indebted to
Tillemont, to Fleury, Baillet, Launoi, and
Bollandus, for having cleared much of this
rubbiſh; and, rejecting what was falſe, by an
enlightened criticiſm, have made that probable,
which before was doubtful.</p>
               <p>' What has been called <hi>The Golden Legend,</hi>
which is the compilation of the above Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne'
obſerves Patin, 'is a book replete with
the moſt ridiculous and ſilly hiſtories ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable'.
Melchior Canus, who was a learned
Dominican, greatly diſapproves of this legend;
and had ſaid, that 'it is a narrative at once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Saints, and every honeſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.
I do not know why it ſhould be called
<hi>golden,</hi> compoſed as it is by a man who had a
mouth of <hi>iron,</hi> and a heart of <hi>lead.</hi>'</p>
               <p>It will, probably, be agreeable to the reader,
to inſpect a ſpecimen of theſe legends. To
gratify his curioſity, I have ſelected the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and, that he may not complain of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1020400300:85"/>
tedious length of this article, it ſhall not be
given to him in the heavy ſtyle of James de
Voraigne, or of myſelf, but embelliſhed by the
luminous diction of Mr. Gibbon—</p>
               <p>' Among the inſipid legends of Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtory, I am tempted to diſtinguiſh the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
fable of <hi>The Seven Sleepers</hi>; whoſe
imaginary date correſponds with the reign of
the younger Theodoſius, and the conqueſt of
Africa by the Vandals. When the Emperor
Decius perſecuted the Chriſtians, ſeven noble
youths of Epheſus concealed themſelves in a
ſpacious cavern, on the ſide of an adjacent
mountain; where they were doomed to periſh
by the tyrant, who gave orders that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
ſhould be firmly ſecured with a pile of
ſtones. They immediately fell into a deep
ſlumber, which was miraculouſly prolonged,
without injuring the powers of life, during a
period of one hundred and eighty-ſeven years.
At the end of that time, the ſlaves of Adolius,
to whom the inheritance of the mountain had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1020400300:86"/>
deſcended, removed the ſtones, to ſupply ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
for ſome ruſtic edifice. The light of the
ſun darted into the cavern, and the Seven
Sleepers were permitted to awake. After a
ſlumber, as they thought, of a few hours, they
were preſſed by the calls of hunger; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that Jamblichus, one of their number,
ſhould ſecretly return to the city, to purchaſe
bread for the uſe of his companions. The
youth—if we may ſtill employ that appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—could no longer recognize the once
familiar aſpect of his native country; and his
ſurprize was increaſed by the appearance of a
large croſs, triumphantly erected over the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
gate of Epheſus. His ſingular dreſs and
obſolete language confounded the baker, to
whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius,
as the current coin of the empire; and Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blichus,
on the ſuſpicion of a ſecret treaſure,
was dragged before the judge. Their mutual
enquiries produced the amazing diſcovery, that
two centuries were almoſt elapſed ſince Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blichus
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1020400300:87"/>
and his friends had eſcaped from the
rage of a Pagan tyrant. The Biſhop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
the Clergy, the Magiſtrates, the people,
and, it is ſaid, the Emperor Theodoſius himſelf,
haſtened to viſit the cavern of the Seven
Sleepers; who beſtowed their benediction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
their ſtory, and at the ſame inſtant peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
expired.</p>
               <p>' This popular tale,' Mr. Gibbon adds,
'Mahomet learned when he drove his camels
to the fairs of Syria; and he has introduced it,
as a <hi>divine revelation,</hi> into the Koran.'—The

by the nations, from Bengal to Africa, who

               <p>ACCIDENT has frequently occaſioned the

Father Mallebranche will ſerve for an example.
Having compleated his ſtudies in Philoſophy
and Theology, without any other intention
than devoting himſelf to ſome religious order,
he little expected to become of ſuch celebrity
as his works have made him. Loitering, in
an idle hour, in the ſhop of a bookſeller, in
turning over a parcel of books, <hi>L'Homme de
Deſcartes</hi> fell into his hands. Having dipt
into ſome parts, he was induced to peruſe the
whole. It was this circumſtance that produced
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1020400300:91"/>
thoſe profound contemplations which gave birth,
to ſo many beautiful compoſitions in Phyſics,
Metaphyſics, and Morality, which have made
him paſs for the Plato of his age.</p>
               <p>Cowley became a Poet by accident. In his
mother's apartment he found, when very young,
Spenſer's Fairy Queen; and, by a continual
ſtudy of Poetry, he became ſo enchanted of the
Muſe, that he grew irrecoverably a Poet.</p>

               <p>D'Andilly, the Tranſlator of Joſephus, one

               <p>The attempts of theſe great monarchs availed
little: the claſh of arms taught a melancholy

might inſpire them to emulate theſe perfect

               <p>Xenophon, for inſtance, and Quintilian,
are excellent to form the education of young
ſcholars.</p>
               <p>Plato will fill the mind with great notions,
and elevate them into a contemplation of the
ſublimeſt metaphyſics.</p>
               <p>Ariſtotle will inſtruct them acutely to analyſe
the principle of compoſition, and to decide on
the beauties of the works of imagination.</p>
               <p>Cicero will ſhew them how to ſpeak and to
write with grace: Seneca, to philoſophiſe.</p>
               <p>The Elder Pliny opens the mind to a great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1020400300:101"/>
diverſity of knowledge. Aeſop and Phaedrus,
in an amuſive way, will form their manners.</p>
               <p>Epictetus, and the Emperor Antoninus, will
afford them advice and counſels in every ſtation
of human life.</p>
               <p>Plutarch offers the nobleſt examples of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
and furniſhes excellent matter for attic
converſations.</p>
               <p>Homer diſplays man in every poſſible ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and paints him always great.</p>
               <p>Virgil inculcates piety towards the gods, and
filial tenderneſs towards our parents.</p>
               <p>In Salluſt, the portraits of the great may be
contemplated; in Plautus and Terence, thoſe
of individuals; in Horace, and the Younger
Pliny, the delicate eulogiums which may be
adminiſtered to kings.</p>
               <p>But, before theſe great models are offered to
the ſtudy of our youth, as they claim a maturity
of judgment, let them firſt be initiated by ſome

               <p>Thus, for inſtance, wherever the Inquiſition

Menage, it is not allowed to employ the word
<hi>fatum,</hi> or <hi>fata,</hi> in any book.</p>
               <p>An author, deſirous of uſing the latter word,

               <p>THE <hi>Notes Variorum</hi> were, originally, but a
compilation of notes drawn from thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
critics who had laboured on the beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,

or had explained them in other works.
The firſt collections were very indifferent, their
ſelectors poſſeſſing no powers of diſcrimination.
Frequently, they have choſen the worſt: they
bring no proofs from the authors whom they
have abridged; and they are continually maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ideas. To make their collections
bulky, they have written as much on the clear
as on the obſcure paſſages, and have ſwelled
them with very frivolous digreſſions.</p>
               <p>The later editions of the <hi>Notes Variorum</hi>
have been made by more able compilers. As
they are ſo much the more preferable to the

There is, however, one thing valuable in the

               </p>
               <p>In the laſt century, it was a conſolation, at
leaſt, for the unſucceſsful writer, that he fell
inſenſibly into oblivion. If he committed the
<hi>private</hi> folly of printing what no one would
purchaſe, he had only to ſettle the matter with
his publiſher: he was not arraigned at the
<hi>public</hi> tribunal, as if he had committed a crime
of magnitude. But, in thoſe times, the nation
was little addicted to the cultivation of letters:
the writers were then few, and the readers were
not many. When, at length, a taſte for lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
ſpread itſelf through the body of the
people, vanity induced the inexperienced and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1020400300:111"/>
the ignorant to aſpire to literary honours. To
oppoſe theſe inroads into the haunts of the
Muſes, Periodical Criticiſm brandiſhed it's
formidable weapon; and it was by the fall of
others that our greateſt geniuſes have been
taught to riſe. Multifarious writings produced
multifarious ſtrictures; and if the rays of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm
were not always of the ſtrongeſt kind,
yet ſo many continually iſſuing, formed
a focus, which has enlightened thoſe whoſe
occupations had otherwiſe never permitted
them to judge on literary compoſitions.</p>
               <p>The origin of ſo many Literary Journals
takes it's birth in France. Denis de Sallo,
Eccleſiaſtical Counſellor in the Parliament of
Paris, invented the ſcheme of a work of this
kind. On the 30th of May 1665, appeared
the firſt number of his <hi>Journal des Sçavans.</hi>'
What is remarkable, he publiſhed his Eſſay in
the name of the Sieur de Hédouville, who was
his <hi>footman.</hi> One is led to ſuppoſe, by this
circumſtance, that he entertained but a faint
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1020400300:112"/>
hope of it's ſucceſs; or, perhaps, he thought
that the ſcurrility of criticiſm might be ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by it's ſuppoſed author. The work,
however, met with ſo favourable a reception,
that Sallo had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing it, in
the next year, imitated throughout Europe;
and his Journal, at the ſame time, tranſlated
into various languages. But, as moſt authors
lay themſelves too open to the ſevere critic, the
animadverſions of Sallo were given with ſuch
malignity of wit and aſperity of criticiſm, that
the Journal excited loud murmurs, and the
moſt heart-moving complaints poſſible. Sallo,
after having publiſhed only his third Journal,
felt the irritated waſps of literature thronging
ſo thick about him, that he very gladly abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the throne of Criticiſm.</p>
               <p>The reign of his ſucceſſor, Abbé Galloys—intimidated by the fate of Sallo—was of a milder
kind. He contented himſelf with only giving
the titles of books, accompanied with extracts.
Such a conduct was not offenſive to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1020400300:113"/>
and yet was not unuſeful to the public.
I do not, however, mean to favour the idea,
that this ſimple manner of noticing books is
equal to ſound and candid criticiſm.</p>
               <p>On the model of the <hi>Journal des Sçavans</hi>
were formed our <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions</hi>;
with this difference, however, that they only
notice objects of ſcience, ſuch as Phyſics and
Mathematics The Journal of Leipſic, entitled
<hi>Acta Eruditorum,</hi> appeared in 1682, under the
conduct of the erudite <hi>Menkenius,</hi> Profeſſor
in the Univerſity of that city. The famous
<hi>Bayle</hi> undertook, for Holland, a ſimilar work,
in 1684; and his <hi>Nouvelles de la Republique de
Lettres</hi> appeared the firſt of May in that year.
This new Journal was every where well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and deſerved to be ſo, for never were
criticiſms given with greater force. He poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
the art of comprizing, in ſhort extracts,
the juſteſt notion of a book, without adding
any thing irrelevant or impertinent. Bayle
diſcontinued this work in 1687, after having
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1020400300:114"/>
given thirty-ſix volumes in 12mo. Others
continued it to 1710, when it was finally
cloſed.</p>
               <p>A Mr. de la Roche formed an Engliſh
Journal, entitled <hi>Memoirs of Literature,</hi> about
the commencement of this century, which is
well ſpoken of in the Bibliotheque Raiſonnée.
It was afterwards continued by Mr. Reid,
under the title of <hi>The Preſent State of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
of Letters.</hi> He ſucceeded very well;
but, being obliged to make a voyage to China,
it interrupted his uſeful labours. He was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by Meſſieurs Campbell and Webſter;
but the laſt, for reaſons of which I am ignorant,
being diſmiſſed, it was again reſumed by Mr.
Campbell. This <hi>Journal</hi> does by no means
rival our modern <hi>Reviews.</hi> I do not perceive
that the criticiſm is more valuable; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the entertainment is inferior. Our
elder Journals ſeem only to notice a few of the
beſt publications; and this not with great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of ſentiment, or elegance of diction.</p>

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1020400300:115"/>
Of our modern Journals it becomes me to
ſpeak with caution. It is not treading on <hi>aſhes</hi>
ſtill glowing with latent fire, as Horace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
it, but it is ruſhing through conſuming
<hi>flames.</hi> Let it be ſufficient, that from their
pages I acknowledge to have acquired a rich
fund of critical obſervation; and, if I have
been animated by their eulogiums, I aſcribe
this honour, not ſo much to the confined abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
Nature has beſtowed on me, as to their
ſtrictures, which have taught me ſomething of

               <p>It has been a cuſtom to echo amongſt the

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1020400300:120"/>
but the power of his pencil ſeems not inferior

               <p>He ſays, that a civil war is our delight, and
the beheading a Monarch our amuſement.
This hardly deſerves the name of Wit; it is
certainly deſtitute of Truth. I have not infre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

more ſanguinary periods than England; and
that <hi>more</hi> of their Kings than of our own have
come to an untimely end. Let us recollect

               <head>THE TALMUD AND GEMARA.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Talmud</hi> is a collection of Jewiſh Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which had been orally preſerved. It
comprizes the <hi>Miſhna,</hi> which is the text; and
the <hi>Gemara,</hi> it's commentary. It is a compleat
ſyſtem of the barbarous learning of the Jews.
They have perſuaded themſelves, that theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
explications are of a Divine origin: for
they tell us, that the Pentateuch was written
out by their Legiſlator before his death; that the
number of Copies was thirteen, one for each
tribe, and the remaining one was depoſited in
the Ark. That the Oral Law, 'was what
Moſes continually taught, in his Sanhedrim, to
the Elders, and the reſt of the people;' the mode
of which honeſt David Levi informs us was
thus—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:1020400300:122"/>
' As ſoon as <hi>Moſes</hi> was returned to his tent
from receiving the words of God, he called
<hi>Aaron</hi> thither unto him, and firſt delivered
unto him the <hi>Text,</hi> which was to be the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law; and after that, the interpretation of it,
which was the <hi>Oral Law,</hi> in the ſame order
as he received <hi>both</hi> from <hi>God</hi> in the Mount.
Then Aaron ariſing, and ſeating himſelf at the
right-hand of Moſes, Eleazar, and Ithamar, his
ſons, went in the next; and being taught both
theſe Laws at the feet of the Prophet, in the
ſame manner as Aaron had been, they alſo
aroſe and ſeated themſelves; and then the
Seventy Elders, who conſtituted the Sanhedrim,
or Great Senate of the nation; and then enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all ſuch of the people as were deſirous of
knowing the word of God.'</p>
               <p>He then informs us that Moſes, Aaron, his
ſons, and the Elders, made the ſame repetition
before they withdrew—'So that the people
having heard <hi>both</hi> theſe Laws repeated to them
four times, they all had it thereby firmly fixed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1020400300:123"/>
in their memories; but the interpretation thereof
was to be delivered down, <hi>only by word of
mouth,</hi> to the ſucceeding generations,' for which
no reaſon is alledged.</p>
               <p>It appears afterwards, that at the end of the
40th year of their flight from Egypt, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the people became treacherous, and
Moſes was conſtrained to repeat, every now and
then, this ſame <hi>Oral Law</hi>; which (if it is not
profane to ſay) had been much better <hi>written</hi>
as the Pentateuch was.</p>
               <p>This hiſtory ſome may be inclined to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be apocryphal. It appears that the
Talmud was compiled by certain Jewiſh doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who were ſolicited for this purpoſe by
their nation, that they might have ſomething
to oppoſe to their Chriſtian adverſaries. Theſe
doctors were deſcendants of the Ten Tribes of
Iſrael, who were led into captivity by king Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manazar,
father of Sennacherib, in the reign
of King Hoſea. This book is a mixture of the
Syriac, the Hebrew, and the vulgar Hebrew,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1020400300:124"/>
which was the language ſpoken in the ſchools
of the Rabbins, and which differs as much from
the other, as the Latin of Bartolinus from that
of Cicero. This work contains nothing that is
valuable, but a very heavy load of pious abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
of inſipid ſtories and palpable contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The only apology that has been made
for theſe extravagancies and idle fictions, is,
that after the completion of the Talmud, thoſe
who ſucceeded in the Schools are diſtinguiſhed
by the name of <hi>Opinioniſts,</hi> and not by that of
<hi>Doctors</hi>; and that no Jew is compelled to receive
them as matters of faith, although we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that this work originated (as we have
already obſerved) from the Great Dictator of
the Written Law.</p>
               <p>As the Reader may be curious to know one of
theſe Rabbinical Reveries, we have compiled
ſome notices which they have given concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Adam's <hi>body</hi> was made of the earth of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
his <hi>head</hi> of the land of Iſrael, his <hi>other</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1020400300:125"/>
                  <hi>members</hi> of other parts of the world. R. Meir
thought he was compact of the earth gathered
out of the whole earth; as it is written—<hi>Thine
eyes did ſee my ſubſtance.</hi> Now it is elſewhere writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten—<hi>The eyes of the Lord are over all the earth.</hi>
R. Aha expreſsly marks the twelve hours
in which his various parts were formed. His
ſtature was from one end of the world to the
other; and it was for his tranſgreſſion that the
Creator, laying his hand in anger on him,
leſſened him; for before, (ſays R. Eleazar)
'with his hand he reached the firmament.'
R. Jehuda thinks his ſin was Hereſy; but R.
Iſaac thinks (as my author expreſſes it) that
'it was nouriſhing his foreſkin.'</p>
               <p>They farther inform us, that he was an
Hermaphrodite, having both ſexes, and a
double body; the female parts joined at the
ſhoulders, and back parts to the male; their
countenances turned from each other. And
this they prove by Moſes ſaying, '<hi>So God
created man in his image; male and female</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:1020400300:126"/>
                  <hi>created he them, and he called their name</hi> ADAM.'
Adam, being ſolitary, cut himſelf in two, (a
hint this to the Managers for their Panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimes)
and found himſelf fitted for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.
Leo Hebraeus thus reconciles the
fable of Plato's <hi>Audrogynus</hi> with the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Moſes, from which he thinks it is
borrowed. Plato relates, that Jupiter, in the
firſt forming of mankind, made them ſuch
<hi>audrogini,</hi> with two bodies, of two ſexes joined
in the breaſt, which he divided for their pride,
the navel ſtill remaining as a <hi>ſcar</hi> of the
wound then made.</p>
               <p>This article may be ſufficient to ſatiate
the Reader with a peruſal of the Talmud.
For his farther ſatisfaction, I refer him to

               <head>CARDINAL RICHELIEU.</head>
               <p>THE preſent anecdote concerning Cardinal
Richelieu may ſerve to teach the man of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1020400300:127"/>
how he deals out Criticiſm to the <hi>Great,</hi>
when they aſk his opinion of Manuſcripts, be
they in verſe or proſe.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal placed in a gallery of his
Palace the portraits of ſeveral illuſtrious men.
Among them was Blaiſe de Montluc, Mareſchal
of France. He was deſirous of compoſing
the inſcriptions which were to be placed
round the portraits. That which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Montluc, was conceived in theſe terms:
<hi>Multa fecit, Plura ſcripſit, Vir tamen, Magnus
fuit.</hi> He ſhewed it to Bourbon, the Royal
Profeſſor in Greek, and aſked his opinion
concerning it. Having read it, he expreſſed
his diſlike in warm terms, and thought it was
Latin much in the ſtyle of the Breviary; and,
if it had concluded with an <hi>Allelujah,</hi> it would
ſerve for an <hi>Anthem</hi> to the <hi>Magnificat.</hi> The
Cardinal agreed with the ſeverity of his ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and even acknowledged the diſcernment
of the Profeſſor; 'for,' he ſaid, 'it is really writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by a Prieſt.' But, however he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1020400300:128"/>
of Bourbon's critical power, he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without mercy his ingenuity. The penſion
his Majeſty had beſtowed on him was withheld
the next year.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal was one of thoſe ambitious
men who fooliſhly aſpire to excel in whatever
a true Genius is moſt excellent; and, becauſe he
ſaw himſef conſtantly diſappointed, he envied,
with all the venom of rancour, thoſe talents
which are ſo frequently <hi>all</hi> that men of genius
poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>Here are two intereſting anecdotes—He
was jealous of Balzac, becauſe his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
became ſo ſplendid: he even offered the
elder Heinſius ten thouſand crowns to write
a Criticiſm which ſhould ridicule his elaborate
compoſitions. This Heinſius refuſed, becauſe
Salmaſius threatened to revenge Balzac on his
<hi>Herodes Infanticida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He attempted to rival the reputation of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille's
Cid, by oppoſing to it one of the moſt
ridiculous productions that was ever exhibited
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1020400300:129"/>
in the theatre. It was an allegorical Tragedy,
in which the <hi>Miniſter</hi> had congregated the four
quarters of the world: it was diſtinguiſhed
by the name of <hi>Europe</hi>; and a great deal of
political matter was thrown together, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into ſcenes and acts. When he firſt ſent
it anonymouſly to the French Academy, it was
reprobated. He then tore it in rage, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
it about his ſtudy. Towards evening, like
another Medea lamenting over the members
of her own children, he and his ſecretary
paſſed the night in uniting the ſcattered limbs.
He then ventured to avow himſelf; and, having
pretended to correct this incorrigible tragedy,
the ſubmiſſive Academy retracted their cenſures—but the Public pronounced it's melancholy
fate, on it's firſt repreſentation. This was the
tragedy which was intended to thwart Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille's
Cid. Enraged at it's ſucceſs, Richelieu
even commanded the Academy to publiſh an
abuſive <hi>Critique</hi> of it, which is well known in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1020400300:130"/>
French literature. Boileau; on this occaſion,
has theſe two well-turned verſes—<q>
                     <l>En vain, contre le Cid, un Miniſtre ſe ligue;</l>
                     <l>Tout Paris, pour Chimene, a les yeux de Rodrigue.</l>
                  </q>
Thus tranſlated by a friend—<q>
                     <l>T' oppoſe the Cid, in vain a ſtateſman tries;</l>
                     <l>All Paris, for <hi>Chimene,</hi> has <hi>Rodrigue's</hi> eyes.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt confeſs, however, that Cardinal
Richelieu was a great politician. Whether his
<hi>Nouveau Teſtament</hi> be his entire compoſition, is
uncertain. He muſt, however, have ſupplied
the materials, as it contains much of what none
but himſelf could know. Theſe anecdotes will
ſerve to ſhew, to what a degree of ſelf-opinion
Vanity may level a great man. He who would
attempt to diſplay Univerſal Excellence, will
probably be diſappointed; it is certain he will
be impelled to practiſe meanneſſes, and to act
follies, which if he has the leaſt ſenſibility,
muſt occaſion him many a pang, and many a

               <head>CARDAN.</head>
               <p>THE famous Cardan was born at Milan, or
at Padua, the place of his nativity being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
in the year 1501. To great natural
powers, he added much acquired knowledge:
but, above all, he was ever deſirous of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, to uſe the expreſſion of a French
writer, he paſſed his life in continual medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
On him the Italians have made this acute
obſervation—that he has written more than he
had read, and taught more than he had learnt.
He died at Rome in 1576, where he attended
Pope Gregory the Thirteenth, in the character
of Phyſician. In his book, <hi>de Arcanis Aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis,</hi>
will be found a great number of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diſcoveries. Scaliger, who has written
againſt him, acknowledges that, in many parts
of his works, his intelligence ſeems greater than
that which any writer ever poſſeſſed; while, in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1020400300:132"/>
other parts, he betrays an imbecillity of mind
which would not be excuſeable in a boy. In
matters of Religion, his opinions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled:
he did not know where to chuſe. All
that has been ſaid of God, of Paradiſe, of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
of Hell, and of the Immortality of the
Soul, &amp;c. were things with him very diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
and we may add, that they have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo likewiſe to others not leſs eminent than

               <p>To oppoſe the Church of Rome in their idea

the immortality of the ſoul.</hi> He ſaid it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
with the body, but that God revived both.
So that, according to his opinion, no one could
enter into the viſible preſence of God till this
operation had taken place. The Romiſh
Church holding a contrary opinion, he treated
as impious what it inculcates concerning the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1020400300:133"/>
immortality of the ſoul. Theſe are dreadful
ſhifts for men who pretend to act by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe

               <p>Calvin was originally named <hi>Cauvin.</hi> His
ſtipend, as Miniſter at Geneva, was as miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as the income of a Welch Curate. He
was ſubject to <hi>eleven</hi> different maladies, which
continually afflicting him, irritated his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.
He had, indeed, ſo much acerbity in his
temper, that he became unſupportable to thoſe
who were near him. It was this that occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many Germans to ſay, 'that they preferred
being in Hell with Beza, to being in Paradiſe
with Calvin.' Every day he taught Theology,
preached, and held various conferences; yet,
in ſpite of all his occupations, he contrived to
leave behind him, as an author, nine ponderous
folios! He died at Geneva, in 1594, aged
fifty-five. He was a learned man; but he
has cauſed a world of woe. He ſtrove ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
to overturn every thing. He was cruel
and vindictive: he occaſioned the perſecution
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1020400300:134"/>
of Michael Servetus, who was ſo cruelly put
to death in the name of a Chriſtian Religion,
and by the hands of men who profeſs Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Gentleneſs; and all this for a difference
about the Trinity!</p>
               <p>It muſt, however, be recollected, that theſe

exaggerated, and the latter muſt be qualified by

writers on Sacred topics who greatly admire
theſe flouriſhes of his pen. We may approve
of their religious zeal, but not of their taſte in
compoſition. Balzac, who pretends to be his
admirer, gives a very ingenious reaſon for it:
he ſays—'It muſt be confeſſed that his ſtyle is
obſcure; but that, like the richeſt ebony,
through it's exceſs of darkneſs, it is bright.'
An idle conceit, like this, offers but a weak
apology for the defects of a writer.</p>

               <p>Malebranche ſays, that 'his manner of

But he was a viſionary, and deſtitute of

               <p>Salmaſius, the acuteſt commentator of the

of Abelard, was in fact written by Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1020400300:138"/>
Biſhop of Paris; a work which has
ſince been <hi>canonized</hi> in the Sorbonne, and on
which is founded the ſcholaſtic theology.
We may add alſo, that becauſe Abelard, in the
warmth of honeſt indignation, had reproved
the Monks of St. Denis, in France, and St.
Gildas de Ruys, in Bretagne, for the horrid
incontinence of their lives, they joined his
enemies, and aſſiſted to embitter the life of this
ingenious ſcholar; who, perhaps, was guilty of
no other crime than that of feeling too ſenſibly
an attachment to one who not only poſſeſſed
the enchanting attractions of the ſofter ſex,

that of one Iſaac de la Pereyre, of Bourdeaux.
He is the author of a book entitled, '<hi>The

Adam is not the firſt of men. He was always
dreaming on this during his life, and died in
it's firm belief. He would have been glad to
have known, that an ancient Rabbin was ſo

even ventured to reveal the name of the <hi>Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>

<hi>was a Rabbin,</hi> and that is ſaying enough.</p>
               <p>When this book firſt made it's appearance,
it was condemned to be burnt by the hand of
the common hangman. Menage has preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a pretty <hi>Bon Mot</hi> of the Prince de Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,
which paſſed about the time this book
made a noiſe. One Father Adam, a Jeſuit,
preached at St. Germain, before the Queen.
The ſermon was execrable; and being at the
ſame time very perſonal, was greately diſliked at
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1020400300:140"/>
Court. The Queen ſpoke concerning it to the
Prince, and aſked him his opinion. 'Madam,'
he replied, 'I am a <hi>Pre-Adamite.</hi>'—'What
does that mean?' ſaid the Queen.'—'It is,
Madam,' the Prince wittily anſwered, 'that
I do not think <hi>Father Adam</hi> to be the <hi>firſt</hi>

               <p>PLINY was by much too bold to advance, in
his Natural Hiſtory, lib. 7. cap. 35. that the

for, if this principle is eſtabliſhed, the good
will no more hope for a recompence of their
miſeries, nor the bad dread a puniſhment for
their crimes.</p>
               <p>Pliny was certainly a man of irreproachable
character: but the truth is, that, like moſt of
the Romans, he aſpired to glory, by ſhewing
that he could be an honeſt man without the hope
of any future reward. The ſentiment is noble,
but let it be confined to the narrow circle of
ſpeculative philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Pliny, to expreſs at the ſame time the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention

lived when gunpowder, fire-arms, and bombs,

Arioſto and Milton have ſatirized this diabolical
machinery, when they gave them to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1020400300:151"/>
than the <hi>Scaligers?</hi> Yet, from the
anecdotes and characters I collect of them, let
the reader contemplate the <hi>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two Scaligers, father and ſon, were two
prodigies of learning and of vanity. Schiop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius
has tore the maſk of that principality with
which the father had adorned himſelf; for the
elder Scaliger maintained that he was deſcended
from the Princes of Verona. Schioppius ſays,
and he is now credited, that he was originally
named Jules Burden; that he was born in the
ſhop of a gilder; had paſſed ſome part of his
life with a ſurgeon; and then became a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier.
The elevation of his mind made him
aſpire to honours greater than theſe: he threw
off his frock, and took the degree of Doctor
in Phyſic at Paris. In this character he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at Venice, and in Piedmont. He there
attached himſelf to a Prelate of the noble
Houſe of Rovezza, and followed him to Agen,
of which his patron was made Biſhop. He
there married the daughter of an apothecary.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1020400300:152"/>
Such were the parents of Joſeph Scaliger;
who, finding this chimerical principality in his
family, paſſed himſelf for a <hi>Prince</hi>; and, to
render the impoſitions of his father more
credible, he added many of his own.</p>
               <p>Naudé ſpeaks thus concerning them—'They
ſay, in Italy, that Scaliger's father married, at
Agen, the daughter of an apothecary; though
others affirm, the baſtard of a biſhop:' pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
of the prelate he followed. 'His ſon
Scaliger was viſited in the character of a <hi>Prince</hi>
at Leyden.'</p>
               <p>By this, I think, it appears that Naudé
gives him credit for the principality; for he
ſeems not in the leaſt to ſmile at the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>' The Duke de Nevers, having paid him a
viſit, offered him a conſiderable preſent, which
Scaliger civilly refuſed.'</p>
               <p>The pride of this ſuppoſititious Prince, who
was but a poor ſtudent, muſt have run high!</p>
               <p>' Schioppius,' adds Naudé, 'muſt have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1020400300:153"/>
been under the influence of ſome demon when
he wrote ſo bad a book againſt Scaliger:' yet
Menage obſerves of this work, that Joſeph
Scaliger died of the chagrin he felt on the
occaſion of Schioppius's book being publiſhed,
entitled, <hi>Scaliger Hypobolymaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' Yet we may,' obſerves Huet, 'ſay, with
Lipſius, that if the two Scaligers were not
actually Princes, they richly merited a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
for the beauty of their genius and the
extent of their erudition; but we can offer
no apology for their ridiculous and ſingular
haughtineſs.</p>
               <p>' When a friend was delineating his character,
the father wrote to him in theſe terms—"En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to collect whatever is moſt beautiful in
the pages of Maſiniſſa, of Xenophon, and of
Plato, and you may then form a portrait which,
however, will reſemble me but imperfectly."</p>
               <p>Yet this man poſſeſſed little delicacy of taſte,
as he evinces by the falſe judgments he paſſes
on Homer and Muſaeus; and, above all, by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1020400300:154"/>
thoſe unformed and rude poems with which
he has diſhonoured Parnaſſus. I have read
ſomewhere a French ſonnet by this man, which
is beneath criticiſm. Menage ſays, that the
collection of Scaliger's poems, which forms a
thick octavo volume, will hardly find it's equal
for bad compoſition, conſidering them as the
productions of a man of letters. Of a great
number of epigrams, there are but four or five
which are in the leaſt tolerable.</p>
               <p>Huet thinks that his ſon compoſed thoſe
letters which paſs under his name; and, as he
is an exquiſite judge of ſtyle, we ſhould credit
his opinion. But, though his poetry is ſo
deſtitute of ſpirit or grace, his proſe, it muſt
be allowed, is excellent: nothing can be more
noble, higher poliſhed, or more happily
turned.</p>
               <p>The ſon poſſeſſed a finer taſte: his ſtyle is
more flowing and eaſy, and yet is not the leſs
noble. His writings, like thoſe of the father,
breathe ſingular haughtineſs and malignity.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1020400300:155"/>
The Scaligerana will convince us that he was
incapable of thinking or ſpeaking favourably
of any perſon. Although he has reflected
honour on his age by the extenſiveneſs of his
learning, we muſt confeſs that he has not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fallen into groſs errors, even on thoſe
ſubjects to which he had moſt applied. As
for inſtance, Chronology, which was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
ſtudy; and although he imagined that
he ſtretched the ſceptre over the realms of
Criticiſm, no one has treated this topic with
leſs felicity. It was the reform of the Calendar
then pending at Rome which engaged him in
this ſtudy. He wiſhed to ſhew the world that
he was more capable than all thoſe who had
been employed. If the ſucceſs of this labour
had depended on the extent and variety of
erudition, he had eminently ſurpaſſed all thoſe
who had applied to this taſk; but he was their
inferior in the ſolidity of his judgment, in the
exactneſs of his arguments, and the profundity
of his ſpeculations. When he fondly believed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1020400300:156"/>
that he had found the Quadrature of the Circle,
he was corrected, and turned into ridicule, by
an obſcure ſchoolmaſter; who, having clearly
pointed out the paralogiſm which deceived him,
made his cyclometrics vaniſh at his touch.</p>
               <p>' Scaliger, the father, was,' ſays Patin, 'an
illuſtrious impoſtor. He had never been at
any war, nor at any court of the Emperor
Maximilian, as he pretended. He paſſed the
firſt thirty years of his life in one continued
ſtudy. Afterwards, he threw off his monk's
frock, and palmed on all Europe the ſingular
impoſition of his being a deſcendant of the
Princes of Verona, who bore the name of
Scaliger.</p>
               <p>Julius Scaliger had this peculiarity in his
manner of compoſition: he wrote with
ſuch accuracy, that his manuſcript and the
printed copy always correſponded page for
page, and line for line. This may appear
trifling information; but I am perſuaded that

Advocate, renounced the Bar, and reſigned
the honour of being <hi>Conſeiller d'Etat,</hi> which
his uncommon merit had obtained him,
though then only twenty-eight years of age.
His brother, <hi>De Sericourt,</hi> who had followed
the military profeſſion, quitted it at the ſame
time. Both conſecrating themſelves to the
ſervice of God, they retired into a little houſe
near <hi>the Port Royal</hi> of Paris. Their brothers,
<hi>De Sacy, De St. Elme,</hi> and <hi>De Valmont,</hi> joined
them. For ſome political reaſon, they were
conſtrained to remove themſelves from that
ſpot, and they then fixed their reſidence at
<hi>Port Royal des Champs.</hi> There again the
Court diſturbed them, after a reſidence of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1020400300:162"/>
little more than two months; but, about a

               <p>With theſe illuſtrious Recluſes many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

were their only occupations. They applied

that ſtation of life, which is deſpiſed by

wealth to provide for the comforts of a long
life: old, I diſliked oeconomy; as I believed
that we need not greatly dread want, when
we have but a ſhort time to be miſerable. I

Science; but to the moſt rational, that I may
ſtrengthen my reaſon. Sometimes, I ſeek for
the more delicate minds, that my taſte may
imbibe their delicacy; ſometimes, for the
gayer, that I may enrich my genius with their
gaiety: and, although I conſtantly read, I
make it leſs may occupation than my pleaſure.
In Religion, and in Friendſhip, I have only to

A Cardinal having cauſed a ſtatue to be
made at Rome, by the great <hi>Angelo,</hi> when it
was finiſhed, he came to inſpect it; and
having, for ſome time, ſagaciouſly conſidered
it, poring now on the face, then on the arms,
the knees, the form of the leg, and, at length,
on the foot itſelf; the ſtatue being of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
beauty, he found himſelf at a loſs to diſplay
his powers of criticiſm, but by laviſhing his
praiſe. But he recollected, that only to praiſe,
might appear as if there had been an obtuſeneſs
in the keenneſs of his criticiſm. He trembled to
find a fault, but a fault muſt be found. At length,
he ventured to mutter ſomething concerning
the noſe; it might, he thought, be ſomething
more Grecian. <hi>Angelo</hi> differed from his Grace,
but he ſaid he would attempt to gratify his
taſte. He took up his chiſſel, and concealed
ſome marble-duſt in his hand; and, feigning to
retouch the part, he adroitly let fall ſome of the
duſt he held concealed. The Cardinal obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

formed the broken cant of his criticiſms.
The honeſt Poet was ſtung with vexation;

As he returned home with Sir Samuel

'you are not ſo well acquainted with his

               <head>THE ART OF CRITICISM.</head>
               <p>AN eminent French Writer has thus very
ingeniouſly traced the origin of Criticiſm.</p>
               <p>The Art of Criticiſm is by no means a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
invention; but it muſt be confeſſed, that
in the laſt age alone it hath reached it's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
degree of perfection.</p>
               <p>According to Dion Chryſoſtom, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
is the inventor of Criticiſm; it is, at leaſt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that it appeared about his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> who flouriſhed at Samos, about
one hundred and fifty years before the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Aera, wrote nine books of Corrections of
the Iliad and Odyſſey, and ſpread a general
alarm amongſt the race of Authors; inſomuch
that, to the preſent day, a <hi>Critic,</hi> and an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarchus,</hi>
are ſynonimous words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1020400300:183"/>
As the Sciences were, for a long time, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
Criticiſm ſhared the ſame fate. There
were, however, even in the moſt barbarous
ages, a few learned men who cultivated it. At
the reſtoration of Letters, Criticiſm, by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of many celebrated Scholars, ſprung up
with new vigour. But two important events
contributed equally to the revival of Letters
and of Criticiſm: the taking of Conſtantinople,
by the Turks, which occaſioned ſeveral of the
learned to retire into Italy and France; and
the invention of Printing, which was diſcovered
about that time.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as this admirable Art was made
public, they applied themſelves to publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excellent Editions of all the good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
according to the moſt correct Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts.
They were indefatigable in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches
for the moſt ancient copies, and they
collated them with the modern ones, by the
ſtricteſt rules of Criticiſm.</p>
               <p>Some formed <hi>Dictionaries</hi> and <hi>Grammars</hi> of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1020400300:184"/>
different languages; and ſome <hi>Commentaries,</hi>
for illuſtrating the Text. Others compoſed
<hi>Treatiſes</hi> on Fabulous Hiſtory, on the Religion,
Government, and the Military Operations of
the Ancients. They dwelt on the minuteſt
particularities which concerned their Manners,
their Apparel, their Repaſts, their Amuſements,
&amp;c. In a word, they neglected nothing which,
after ſo wide an interval, might throw new
lights on what remained of the Grecian and
the Roman Compoſitions.</p>
               <p>The Learned of the Sixteenth Century made
new efforts, not only to clear the uncultivated
lands of the Republic of Letters, which had
remained unexplored by their predeceſſors, but
alſo to improve thoſe they had inherited. They
prided themſelves in the freeſt diſcuſſions; they
rummaged every library, to bring to light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed
Manuſcripts; they compared them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
they arranged thoſe hiſtorical facts
which were neceſſary to reſtore the texts, and
to ſix the dates; and they were careful, above
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1020400300:185"/>
all things, not to decide on the ſenſe of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
without a mature examination, and a
laborious collation.</p>
               <p>Yet, after the immenſe labours of Juſtus
Lipſius, the Scaligers, Turnebus, Budaeus, Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
and ſo many other learned men, Criticiſm
ſtill remained imperfect; and it is only in the
laſt age that it attained to the height which it
now has reached.</p>
               <p>This perfection of Criticiſm is owing to the
eſtabliſhment of ACADEMIES, particularly
thoſe of the French and the Belles Lettres
Academies. In their labours may be found
thoſe numerous and judicious Remarks, which
had eſcaped the penetration of the firſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in Europe.</p>
               <p>I cannot quit this Article, without obſerving,
that it is much to the diſhonour of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
character, no Academy, dedicated to the
BELLES LETTRES, has ever been eſtabliſhed.
To raiſe ſuch an ACADEMY, is a glory ſtill
reſerved for an Auguſtan Monarch.</p>

               <head>THE ABSENT MAN.</head>
               <p>WITH the character of Bruyere's Abſent
Man, it is probable, the reader is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.
It is tranſlated in the Spectator, and
it has been exhibited on the Theatre. The
general opinion runs, that it is a fictitious
character, or, at leaſt, one the Author has too
highly coloured: it was well known, however,
to his contemporaries, to be the Count De
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1020400300:187"/>
Brancas. The preſent Anecdotes concerning
the ſame perſon, have been unknown to, or
forgotten by, Bruyere; and, as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
genuine, and, at the ſame time,
to the full as extraordinary as thoſe which
characterize <hi>Menalcas,</hi> or the Abſent Man; it
is but reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the character,
however improbable it may appear, is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

               <p>One day, when the Count was walking in

croſſed the way, to ſpeak to him. 'God bleſs
thee, poor man!' exclaimed the Count. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefoucault
ſmiled, and was beginning to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
him—'Is it not enough,' cried the
Count, interrupting him, and ſomewhat in a
paſſion; 'is it not enough that I have ſaid,
at firſt, I have nothing for you? Such lazy
beggars as you hinder a gentleman from walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

loud laugh; and awakening the Abſent Man
from his lethargy, he was not a little ſurprized,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1020400300:188"/>
himſelf, that he ſhould take his friend for an
importunate mendicant!</p>
               <p>The Count was reading by the fire-ſide, but
Heaven knows with what degree of attention,
when the nurſe brought him his infant-child.
He throws down the book; he takes the child
in his arms—he was playing with her, when
an important viſitor was announced. Having
forgot he had quitted his book, and that it was
his child he held in his hands, he threw her
down violently on the table; and, probably,
was ſurprized to hear loud cries iſſue from his

ſhould they even convey to the reader their

which a fanatical Preacher employed, when
he called on the Lord to wipe his lips with
the <hi>napkin</hi> of his love; and when he talked of
the <hi>lamp</hi> of love, and the <hi>candle</hi> of divine
grace.</p>
               <p>Biſhop Latimer preached, in the year 1527,
a ſermon, in which he ſays—'Now, ye have
heard what is meant by this <hi>firſt card,</hi> and how
ye ought to <hi>play:</hi> I purpoſe again to <hi>deal</hi> unto
you another <hi>card</hi> of the ſame <hi>ſuit</hi>; for they be

               <p>About the middle of the Seventeenth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
a country miniſter—Fuller informs us—imitated theſe ridiculous alluſions of Latimer;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1020400300:190"/>
but the congregation, now ſomewhat more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
than in the good Biſhop's time, could not
refrain from immoderate peals of laughter.</p>
               <p>Perron obſerves, that in employing <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,</hi>
we muſt not deſcend from the <hi>general</hi>
to the <hi>particular:</hi> we may be allowed to ſay—the <hi>flames</hi> of love, but not the <hi>candle,</hi> the
<hi>lamp,</hi> and the <hi>wick</hi> of love. Saint Anſelm
exclaims—'<hi>Draw</hi> me, O Lord! that I may
<hi>run</hi> after thee; faſten me with the <hi>cords</hi> of thy

into an <hi>Enigma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pere Bouhours alſo obſerves, that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
muſt not be continued too far, and
that when they are thus overſtrained, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
trifling and frigid. Theſe two inſtances
will explain what is here meant—</p>
               <p>An Italian, on his return from Poland, ſaid,
that the perſons of that country were as white
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1020400300:191"/>
as their ſnows; but, that they were even colder
than they were white; and that frequently,
from their converſations, he caught a <hi>cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coſtar ſays, that the Lectures of Malherbe
were ſatiating and cloying to a degre—ſo as to
deſtroy the <hi>appetite</hi> of thoſe who heard them,
and to ſave them the expence of a <hi>dinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the firſt it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Cold,</hi> as
a figure, is an eſtabliſhed Metaphor; but that
from this cold we are likely to catch one, is
what paſſes the juſt limits of the Metaphor, as
well as thoſe lectures, which cloyed till they
occaſioned a loſs of appetite, and ſaved the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of a dinner.</p>
               <p>It was ſaying enough, that they were ſatiating
and diſagreeable, without adding the reſt, which
goes to ſuch an extreme, and which is not
likely. This, however, muſt be underſtood,
when the Author ſpeaks in a ſerious ſtyle:
for, if he means to employ ſuch Metaphors
with levity, and in joking, they would then
not ſhock us; becauſe, when we laugh, we
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1020400300:192"/>
may be allowed great latitude; and, according
to Ariſtotle and Quintilian, whenever we

               <p>An ancient Satiriſt ſays, that if we wiſh to

One was, the Standard of our Engliſh Coin,
when he compares it, in a note, with that of
ſome Foreign Coin he had to eſtimate. The
other point was, when, in ſpeaking of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

he adds—'They probably derived this cuſtom

This is a flagrant error; ſince it has
always been their cuſtom, rather to indulge
in feſtal enjoyments on that day. It is, with
them, a rule to obſerve no Faſt on the Sabbath,

ſhew, that the cry againſt <hi>Innovation</hi> is not
peculiar to the Clergy of the preſent day, even
againſt the opinions of the moſt moderate
amongſt their own body.</p>
               <p>' Such perſons were the brave Biſhops of
the Lionnois, who aſſembled a Synod to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the regulations of Saint Anthony in that
Province. The Monks of that place were
diſtinguiſhed by the title of the <hi>Hogs of Saint

pains of making <hi>eight repaſts</hi> in one day, to
ſhew the weakneſs of Human Nature!</p>
               <p>There were ſome Jeſuits, and ſome young

               </p>
               <p>The conteſt was renewed with vigour on the

               <head>ON THE CUSTOM OF SALUTING AFTER
SNEEZING.</head>
               <p>SOME Catholics—ſays Father Feyjoo—have
attributed the origin of this cuſtom to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of a Pope—Saint Gregory—who is ſaid
to have inſtituted a ſhort Prayer to be uſed on
ſuch occaſions, at a time when a Peſtilence
raged; the criſis of which was attended by
<hi>ſneezing,</hi> and, in moſt caſes, followed by <hi>death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rabbins have a tale, that, before Jacob,
men never ſneezed but <hi>once,</hi> and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<hi>died:</hi> but that that Patriarch obtained
the revocation of this law; the memory of
which was ordered to be preſerved in <hi>all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
by a command of every Prince to his
ſubjects to employ ſome ſalutary exclamation
after the act of ſneezing.</p>
               <p>Theſe accounts are, probably, alike fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
the pious fictions of pious men; both
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1020400300:197"/>
becauſe—continues Feyjoo—the enquiries of
Ariſtotle concerning this ſtrange circumſtance,
and the alluſions to it in Apuleius, Petronius,
Pliny, and others, prove it to have exiſted
many ages prior to Saint Gregory; and it is
related, in a Memoir of the French Academy
of Sciences, to have been found practiſed in
the New World, on the firſt diſcovery of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.
This is not only ſaid to be a fact, but
ſome Writers alſo give us an amuſing account
of the ceremonies which attend the <hi>ſneezing</hi> of
a King of Monomotapa—Thoſe who are near
his perſon, when this happens, ſalute him in
ſo loud a tone, that thoſe who are in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber
hear it, and join in the acclamation.
Thoſe who are in the adjoining apartments do
the ſame, until the noiſe reaches the ſtreet, and
becomes propagated throughout the city: ſo
that, at each ſneeze of his Majeſty, reſults a
moſt horrid cry from the ſaluations of many
thouſands of his vaſſals.</p>
               <p>That a cuſtom, ſo univerſally prevalent,

' A Student at Law, who ſtudied at Poitiers,
had tolerably improved himſelf in caſes of
Equity; not that he was overburthened with
Learning, but his chief deficiency was a want
of aſſurance and confidence to diſplay his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
His father paſſing by Poitiers, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him to read aloud, and to render his
memory more prompt by a continued exerciſe.
To obey the injunctions of his father, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to read at the <hi>Miniſtery.</hi> In order to obtain
a certain aſſurance, he went every day into a
garden, which was a very ſecret ſpot, being at
a diſtance from any houſe, and where there
grew a great number of fine large cabbages.
Thus, for a long time, as he purſued his ſtudies,
he went to repeat his leſſon to theſe cabbages,
addreſſing them by the title of <hi>Gentlemen</hi>;
and dealing out his ſentences, as if they had
compoſed an audience of Scholars at a Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
After having prepared himſelf thus
for a fortnight or three weeks, he began to
think it was high time to take the <hi>chair</hi>;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1020400300:200"/>
imagining that he ſhould be able to harangue
the Scholars, as well as he had before done his
cabbages. He comes forward, he begins his
Oration—but, before he had ſaid a dozen
words, he remained dumb, and became ſo
confuſed, that he knew not where he was:
ſo that all he could bring out was—<hi>Domini,
Ego bene video quod non eſtis caules:</hi> that is to
ſay—for there are ſome who will have every
thing in plain Engliſh—<hi>Gentlemen, I now
clearly ſee you are not cabbages.</hi> In the <hi>garden,</hi>
he could conceive the <hi>cabbages</hi> to be <hi>Scholars</hi>;

               <p>The hall of the School of Equity, at Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,

by the name, is moſt certainly an
impoſition; which, ſtriking on the feebleſt part
of the human mind, has ſo frequently been
ſucceſsful in carrying on it's deluſions.</p>
               <p>As late as the days of Mrs. Manley, the
authoreſs of the Atalantis, is there on record
a moſt ſingular deluſion of Alchymy. The
recollection, whether it was herſelf, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſon, on whom it was practiſed, has
now eſcaped me. From the circumſtances, it
is very probable, the Sage was not leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1020400300:211"/>
It appears, that an infatuated lover of this
deluſive Art met with one who pretended to
have the power of tranſmuting Lead to Gold.
This Hermetic Philoſopher required only the
materials, and time, to perform his golden
operations. He was taken to the country reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his Patroneſs: a long laboratory was
built; and, that his labours might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded
by any diſturbance, no one was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to enter into it. His door was contrived
to turn round on a ſpring; ſo that, unſeen, and
unſeeing, his meals were conveyed to him,
without diſtracting the ſublime contemplations
of the Sage.</p>
               <p>During a reſidence of two years, he never
condeſcended to ſpeak but two or three times
in the year to his infatuated Patroneſs. When
ſhe was admitted into the Laboratory, ſhe ſaw,
with pleaſing aſtoniſhment, ſtills, immenſe
cauldrons, long flues, and three or four Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canian
fires blazing at different corners of this
magical mine; nor did ſhe behold with leſs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1020400300:212"/>
reverence the venerable figure of the duſty
Philoſopher. Pale and emaciated, with daily
operations and nightly vigils, he revealed to
her, in unintelligible jargon, his progreſſes:
and, having ſometimes condeſcended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the myſteries of the Arcana, ſhe beheld,
or ſeemed to behold, ſtreams of fluid, and heaps
of ſolid Ore, ſcattered around the laboratory.
Sometimes he required a new ſtill, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
vaſt quantities of lead. Already this
unfortunate lady had expended the half of her
fortune, in ſupplying the demands of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.
She began, now, to lower her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
to the ſtandard of Reaſon. Two
years had now elapſed, vaſt quantities of lead
had gone in, and nothing but lead had come
out. She diſcloſed her ſentiments to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
He candidly confeſſed, he was himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at his tardy proceſſes; but that now he
would exert himſelf to the utmoſt, and that he
would venture to perform a laborious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which, hitherto, he had hoped not to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1020400300:213"/>
have been neceſſitated to employ. His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs
retired, and the golden viſions of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
reſumed all their luſtre.</p>
               <p>One day, as they ſat at dinner, a terrible
ſhriek, and one crack followed by another,
loud as the report of cannon, aſſailed their ears.
They haſtened to the laboratory: two of the
greateſt Stills had burſt; one part of the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
was in flames, and the deluded Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
ſcorched to death!</p>
               <p>An Author, who wrote in the year 1704,
preſents us with the following Anecdote, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

               <p>' The late Duke of Buckingham, being
over-perſuaded by a pack of knaves, who called
themſelves Chemical Operators, that they had
the ſecret of producing the Philoſopher's Stone,
but wanted money to carry on the proceſs; his
Grace engaged to aſſiſt them with money to
carry on the work, and performed his promiſe
at a vaſt expence. A laboratory was built,
utenſils provided, and the family filled with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1020400300:214"/>
the moſt famous Artiſts in the tranſmutation
of Metals—Adepts of a ſuperior claſs, who
would concern themſelves only about the
grand Elixir, and a pack of ſhabby curs, to
attend the fires, and do other ſervile offices;
and yet, forſooth, muſt be alſo called Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>
               <p>' This great charge continued upon the Duke
for ſome years; for, whoever was unpaid, or
whatever was neglected, money muſt be found
to bear the charge of the laboratory, and pay
the Operators; till this chimera, with other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies,
had cauſed the mortgaging and
ſelling many fine Manors, Lordſhips, Towns,
and good Farms.</p>
               <p>' All this time, nothing was produced by
theſe ſons of Art of any value; for, either the
glaſs broke, or the man was drunk and let
out the fire, or ſome other misfortune, ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the grand proceſs, at the time aſſigned
for a <hi>je ne ſçai quoi</hi> to be produced, that muſt
turn all things to gold. The Duke encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1020400300:215"/>
nothing but diſappointments, and the
Operators finding themſelves ſlighted, and
money very difficult to be had, the project
fell!'</p>
               <p>Penotus, who died at ninety-eight years of
age, in the Hoſpital of Sierdon in Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

him, above all things, to give himſelf
up to the ſtudy and practice of Alchymy.'</p>

               <p>Mr. Gibbon has this ſuccinct paſſage relative
to Alchymy—'The ancient books of Alchymy,
ſo liberally aſcribed to Pythagoras, to Solomon,
or to Hermes, were the pious frauds of more
recent adepts. The Greeks were inattentive
either to the uſe or the abuſe of Chymiſtry.
In that immenſe Regiſter, where Pliny has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
the diſcoveries, the arts, and the errors,
of mankind, there is not the leaſt mention of
the tranſmutations of metals; and the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Diocleſian is the firſt authentic event
in the hiſtory of Alchymy. The conqueſt of
Egypt, by the Arabs, diffuſed that vain ſcience
over the globe. Congenial to the avarice of
the human heart, it was ſtudied in China, as
in Europe, with equal eagerneſs and equal
ſucceſs. The darkneſs of the middle ages en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
a favourable reception to every tale of
wonder; and the revival of learning gave new
vigour to hope, and ſuggeſted more ſpecious
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1020400300:217"/>
arts to deception. Philoſophy, with the aid
of experience, has at length baniſhed the ſtudy
of Alchymy; and the preſent age, however
deſirous of riches, is content to ſeek them by
the humbler means of commerce and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.'</p>
               <p>After this, will it be credited that, even in
this enlightened age, a writer ſhould ſtand
forth as it's advocate? Mr. Andrews, in his
Anecdotes, has an article concerning Alchymy.
His account of Nicholas Flamel is not accurate.
He attributes 'his myſterious proſperity to
that <hi>great ſecret</hi> which has been ſought for
through ages, and which, <hi>to this day,</hi> has it's
<hi>believers.</hi>' Of theſe <hi>believers,</hi> undoubtedly, Mr.

that an ancient Greek author has written on
<hi>Phyſiognomy.</hi> This work is tranſlated into
Latin by the Count Charles de Montecuculli,
enriched with very learned annotations.</p>
               <p>One Walfon aſſured George Weller, who
publiſhed his Travels into Dalmatia, Greece,
and the Levant—a very curious work—that he
had purchaſed a cheſt-full of very ſcarce Arabic

               <p>The following curious phyſiological definition
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1020400300:226"/>
of PHYSIOGNOMY is extracted from a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by Dr. Gwither, of the year 1604—</p>
               <p>' Soft wax cannot receive more various and
numerous impreſſions than are imprinted on a
man's face by <hi>objects</hi> moving his affections:
and not only the <hi>objects</hi> themſelves have this
power, but alſo the very <hi>images</hi> or <hi>ideas</hi>; that
is to ſay, any thing that puts the animal ſpirits
into the ſame motion that the <hi>object</hi> preſent did,
will have the ſame effect with the object. To
prove the firſt, let one obſerve a man's face
looking on a pitiful object, then a ridiculous,
then a ſtrange, then on a terrible or dangerous
object, and ſo forth. For the ſecond, that <hi>ideas</hi>
have the ſame effect with the <hi>object,</hi> dreams
confirm too often.</p>
               <p>' The manner I conceive to be thus—The
animal ſpirits, moved in the ſenſory by an
object, continue their motion to the brain;
whence the motion is propagated to this or
that particular part of the body, as is moſt
ſuitable to the deſign of it's creation; having
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1020400300:227"/>
firſt made an alteration in the <hi>face</hi> by it's
nerves, eſpecially by the <hi>pathetic</hi> and <hi>oculorum
motorii</hi> actuating it's many muſcles, as the dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
to that ſtupendous piece of clock-work,
which ſhews what is to be expected next from
the ſtriking part. Not that I think the motion
of the ſpirits in the ſenſory continued by the
impreſſion of the object all the way, as from
a finger to the foot: I know it too weak, though
the tenſeneſs of the nerves favours it. But I
conceive it done in the medulla of the brain,
where is the common ſtock of ſpirits; as in an
organ, whoſe pipes being uncovered, the air
ruſhes into them; but the keys, let go, are
ſtopped again. Now, if by repeated acts, or
frequent entertaining of the ideas of a favourite
idea of a paſſion or vice which natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
has hurried one to, or cuſtom dragged,
the <hi>face</hi> is ſo often put into that poſture which
attends ſuch acts, that the animal ſpirits find
ſuch latent paſſages into it's nerves, that it is
ſometimes unalterably ſet: as the <hi>Indian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1020400300:228"/>
are, by long continuing in ſtrange
poſtures in their <hi>Pagods.</hi> But, moſt commonly,
ſuch a habit is contracted, that it falls inſenſibly
into that poſture, when ſome preſent object
does not obliterate that more natural impreſſion
by a new, or diſſimulation hide it.</p>
               <p>' Hence it is that we ſee great <hi>drinkers</hi> with
<hi>eyes</hi> generally ſet towards the noſe, the adducent
muſcles being often employed to let them ſee
their loved liquor in the glaſs at the time of
drinking; which were, therefore, called <hi>bibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
Laſcivious perſons</hi> are remarkable for the
<hi>Oculorum Mobilis Petulanta,</hi> as Petronius calls
it. From this alſo we may ſolve the <hi>Quaker's</hi>
expecting face, waiting the pretended Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and the melancholy face of the <hi>Sectaries</hi>;
the <hi>ſtudious</hi> face of men of great application of
mind; revengeful and <hi>bloody men,</hi> like execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
in the act: and though ſilence, in a
ſort, may awhile paſs for wiſdom, yet, ſooner
or later, Saint Martin peeps through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
to undo all. A <hi>changeable face</hi> I have
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1020400300:229"/>
obſerved to ſhew a <hi>changeable mind.</hi> But I
would by no means have what has been ſaid
underſtood as without exception; for I doubt
not but ſometimes there are found men with

               <p>IT was an ancient ceremony of the Jews,
which yet is religiouſly obſerved amongſt
them, to tear their cloaths in mourning and
affliction. Some Orientals ſtill practiſe this
cuſtom, when any thing uncommonly diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
happens. The Jews make uſe of much
ceremony on this occaſion—Sometimes, they
tear from the top to the bottom; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1020400300:233"/>
from the bottom to the top. The rent
muſt be of a particular length. When it is
done for the loſs of parents, it is never ſewed;
for the loſs of other perſons, it is ſewed at the
end of thirty days. This piece of religious
mummery, if it is of no other value, will at
leaſt ſerve to explain a paſſage, in which Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
in his Proverbs, ſays, that '<hi>There is a time
to rend, and a time to ſew.</hi>' Which means,
there is a time for affliction, and a time for
conſolation. Many of the Scripture-phraſes,
that appear unintelligible, are founded on
Jewiſh cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bruce, in his Travels, obſerved in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade,
the head-dreſs of the Governors of
Provinces. A large broad fillet was bound
upon their forehead, and tied behind their
head. In the middle of this was a HORN, or a
conical piece of ſilver, gilt, much in the ſhape
of our candle-extinguiſhers. This is called
<hi>Kirn,</hi> or <hi>Horn,</hi> and is only worn in reviews,

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1020400300:234"/>
borrowed from the Hebrews, our Traveller
conceives, will explain the ſeveral alluſions
made to it in Scripture. 'I ſaid unto fools,

up the HORN—Lift not up your HORN on

HORN ſhalt thou exalt like the horn of an

who have pretended to ſay, that the great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

under myſterious phraſes.</p>
               <p>' If it is difficult'—ſays De Bure—'to give
a juſt idea of this extravagant Work, it is,
however, more eaſy to inform the reader of
it's rarity. It has been long known amongſt
the Literary <hi>Connoiſſeurs</hi>; and it is certain,
that nothing is more difficult than to find a
compleat copy. Some curious Collectors have
endeavoured, by ſacrificing a great number of
copies, to join it's ſeparate parts; but they
have always found their endeavours fruſtrated.
This myſterious Work ſeems to have a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
concluſion.</p>
               <p>This rare Volume Conſiſts—according to
the moſt compleat Copy extant—of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and three fugitive and ſeparate Pieces,
which the Author cauſed, himſelf, to have
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1020400300:237"/>
printed, and which he diſtributed, himſelf, in
ſtreets, and houſes, to thoſe perſons who made
him ſome pecuniary preſent, as he himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, by the acknowledgments which he
makes in ſome of his pieces; where he puts
not only the name and the quality of thoſe to
whom he preſented them, but alſo the ſums
which he received from each individual.'</p>
               <p>The Abbé Ladvocat has given the following
ſuccinct account of this man—'He knew the
art of gaining his livelihood by diſtributing his
extravagancies to whoever he found was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to purchaſe them. They contain orations,
ſentences, but more frequently prophecies.
Many have ill-ſpent their time in explaining
the myſteries of his work; and, as is uſual in
theſe caſes, every one found what he ſought:
but the truth is, they are viſions which come
from a head leſs ridiculous than thoſe of the
perſons who received them with reſpect, and
recompenſed them with their money, unleſs
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1020400300:238"/>
they were guided to act thus by the benevolence
of Charity.'</p>
               <p>After what has been laid before the reader,
will it be believed that a compleat collection of
the Comte de Permiſſion's abſurdities would
fetch a very high price among a certain claſs
of <hi>Literati?</hi> It happens, however, that his
<hi>leaves,</hi> which reſemble in their deſign thoſe of
the Roman <hi>Sybils,</hi> are as difficult to be found.
There are men who diſplay a rich fund of
<hi>Erudition</hi> only by ſtudying <hi>Catalogues</hi>; and
feel themſelves as much enchanted by the

               <head>IMPOSITIONS OF AUTHORS.</head>
               <p>THERE have been ſome Authors who have
practiſed ſingular Impoſitions on the public.
Varillas, the French Hiſtorian, enjoyed for
ſome time a great reputation in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for his Hiſtoric Compoſitions. When they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1020400300:239"/>
became more known, the ſcholars of other
countries deſtroyed the reputation he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
acquired. 'His continual profeſſions
of ſincerity prejudiced many in his favour,
and made him paſs for a writer who had pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
into the inmoſt receſſes of the cabinet:
but the public were at length undeceived, and
were convinced that the Hiſtorical Anecdotes,
which Varillas put off for authentic facts, had
no foundation, being wholly his own invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!—though he endeavoured to make them
paſs for realities, by affected citations of titles,
inſtructions, letters, memoirs, and relations, all
of them imaginary!'</p>
               <p>Melchiſedec Thevenot, Librarian to the
French king, was never out of Europe; yet
he has compoſed ſome folio volumes of his
'Voyages and Travels,' by information and
memoirs, which he collected from thoſe who
had travelled. 'Travels,' obſerves the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler
of the Biographical Dictionary, 'related
at ſecond hand, can never be of any great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1020400300:240"/>
or moment.' Aſſuredly not; but they
may be pregnant with errors of all kinds.</p>
               <p>Gemelli Carreri, a Neapolitan gentleman,
who, for many years, never quitted his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
being confined by a tedious indiſpoſition,
amuſed himſelf with writing a voyage round
the world; giving characters of Men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
of Countries, as if he had really
viſited them. Du Halde, who has written ſo
voluminous an account of China, compiled it
from the Memoirs of the Miſſionaries, and
never travelled ten leagues from Pairs in his
life; though he appears, by his writings, to
be very familiar with the Chineſe ſcenery.</p>
               <p>This is an excellent obſervation of an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
Author. '<hi>Writers</hi> who never viſited
foreign countries, and <hi>Travellers</hi> who have
run through immenſe regions with fleeting
pace, have given us long accounts of various
Countries and People; evidently collected from
the idle reports and abſurd traditions of the
ignorant vulgar, from whom only they could
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1020400300:241"/>
have received thoſe relations which we ſee

               <p>To render a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> perfect, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to attend to theſe rules.—The Tranſlator
muſt poſſeſs a thorough knowledge of the two
Languages. He muſt be exact, not only in
giving the thoughts of his Author, but even
his own words, when they become eſſential and
neceſſary. He muſt preſerve the ſpirit and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
genius of his Author. He muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
every character by it's manners and it's
nature, by unfolding the ſenfe and the words
with ſuitable phraſes and parallel expreſſions.
He muſt yield beauties by other beauties, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1020400300:242"/>
figures by other figures, whenever the idiom
of Language does not admit of a cloſe verſion.
He muſt not employ long Sentences, unleſs
they ſerve to render the ſenſe more intelligible,
and the diction more elegant. He muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
a neatneſs in his manner; and, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this, he muſt know ſkilfully to contract or
enlarge his Periods. He muſt unite the too
conciſe Sentences of his Author, if his ſtyle,
like that of Tacitus, be cloſe and abrupt. He
muſt not only ſedulouſly attempt preciſion
and purity of diction, but he muſt ſtrive alſo
to embelliſh his verſion with thoſe graces and
images which frequently lie ſo cloſely hidden,
that nothing but a familiar converſancy with
his Author can diſcover them. And, laſtly, he
muſt preſent us with the ſentiments of his
Author, without a ſervile attachment to his
words or phraſes, but rather, according to his
ſpirit and his genius.</p>
               <p>A Tranſlator is a Painter who labours after
an original. He muſt carefully reveal the <hi>traits</hi>

               <head>THE ORIGIN OF NEWSPAPERS AND PERIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICAL
LITERATURE.</head>
               <p>THE Newſpapers of the preſent day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted
with their original models, have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a degree of excellence which is flattering
to modern induſtry to contemplate. While
political events are regiſtered with a celerity
unknown to our anceſtors, the ſentiments of
liberty are diſſeminated in the warm impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the moment. The frivolous purſuits
of the age offer an ample field to thoſe who
can point with force the keenneſs of Ridicule.
Faſhion, however verſatile, cannot eſcape the
eye of the ſatiriſt; and the follies of the night
are chronicled for the ſober contemplation of
the morning. Literature has been called in to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1020400300:244"/>
embelliſh theſe diurnal pages; and it has given
a ſtability and perfection of which the evaneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
nature of ſuch productions was hardly
thought ſuſceptible. It is, however, a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
truth, that ſuch excellent purpoſes have
been fruſtrated by a vile ſpirit of faction; a
ſpirit that, according to the ſenſible <hi>Rapin,</hi>
will ſooner overturn the Engliſh Conſtitution
than the united efforts of our moſt powerful
enemies. But ſuch diſcuſſions we leave to the
ſagacious politicians.</p>
               <p>Periodical Papers ſeem firſt to have been
uſed by the Engliſh during the Civil Wars of
the uſurper Cromwell, to diſſeminate amongſt
the people the ſentiments of Loyalty or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
according as their Authors were diſpoſed.
We ſeem to have been obliged to the Italians
for the idea; and, perhaps, it was their <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettas</hi>—from <hi>Gazzera,</hi> a magpie or chatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—which have given a name to theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
Honeſt <hi>Peter Heylin,</hi> in the preface to
his <hi>Coſmography,</hi> mentions that—'the affairs
of each Town, or War, were better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1020400300:245"/>
to the reader in the <hi>Weekly News-Books.</hi>'
In their origin they were ſolely devoted to
political purpoſes: but they ſoon became a
public nuiſance, by ſerving as receptacles
of party malice, and echoing to the fartheſt
ends of the kingdom the inſolent voice of Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They ſet the minds of Men more at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
enflamed their tempers to a greater
fierceneſs, and gave a keener edge to the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of civil diſcord.</p>
               <p>It is to be lamented, that ſuch works will
always find writers adapted to their ſcurrilous
purpoſes; but of a vaſt crowd that iſſued from
the preſs, though little more than a century
has elapſed, they are now not to be found but
in a few private Collections. They form a
race of Authors unknown to moſt readers of
theſe times: the name of their Chief, however,
has juſt reached us, but is on the point of
diſappearing.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange,</hi> who appears to have
greatly ſurpaſſed his rivals, and to have been
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1020400300:246"/>
eſteemed as the moſt perfect model of political
writing, merits little praiſe. The temper of
the man was factious and brutal, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of the Author very indifferent. In
his multifarious productions, and meagre
tranſlations, we diſcover nothing that indicates
one amiable ſentiment, to compenſate for a
barbarous diction, and a heavy load of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
traſh. His attempts at Wit are clumſy
exertions; the aukward efforts of a German
who labours on a delicate toy. When he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
the gravity of the ſage, he ſeems more
fortunate in extorting a laugh; burleſquing
the moſt ſolemn reflections by quaint and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
expreſſion.</p>
               <p>In the reign of <hi>Queen Anne</hi>—not unjuſtly
characterized by being diſtinguiſhed as the
Auguſtan Age of Engliſh Literature—Periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Prints, that till then had only ſerved po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
purpoſes, began to rank higher in the
eſtimation of the Public. Some had already
attempted to introduce literary ſubjects, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1020400300:247"/>
other topics of a more general ſpeculation. But
we ſee nothing that has eſcaped the waſte of
time, till <hi>Sir Richard Steele</hi> formed the plan
of his <hi>Tatler.</hi> He deſigned it to embrace the
three provinces, of Manners, of Letters, and
of Politics. He knew that this was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable
improvement; and, doubtleſs, he
thought, that if the laſt portion could be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it would ſtill have made it more perfect.
But violent and ſudden reformation is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be uſed; and the Public were to be
conducted inſenſibly into ſo new and different
a track from that to which they had been
hitherto accuſtomed. Hence Politics were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into his Paper. But it remained for the
chaſter genius of <hi>Addiſon</hi> to baniſh this diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
topic from his elegant pages. The
writer in Polite Letters felt himſelf degraded
by ſinking into the dull narrator of Political
Events. It is from this time, that Newſpapers
and periodical Literature became diſtinct
works.</p>

               <head>LITERARY COMPOSITION.</head>
               <p>IN a little Tract, printed in 1681, is to be
found ſome curious literary information. The
ingenious author attempts to mark out the
moſt profitable way of reading and writing
books. He firſt informs us of various vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
writers; of ſome, ſo infected with
the <hi>cacoethes ſcribendi,</hi> that they have compoſed
from ſix to ſeven thouſand volumes! He then
notices vaſt libraries; ſuch as that of Ptolomy,
King of Egypt, which was ſaid to contain
four hundred thouſand; or, as others write,
ſeven hundred thouſand volumes: and alſo that
of the younger Theodoſius at Conſtantinople,
containing ten myriads of books.</p>
               <p>He reflects that, ſince the invention of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an Author can publiſh as much in <hi>one day</hi>
as he has compoſed in <hi>one year.</hi> He laments,
that theſe multifarious volumes may prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1020400300:249"/>
to the Student; that ſuch a continued
novelty of matter will render his knowledge
leſs clear and digeſted than before this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
took place: though he is willing to allow
that this evil originates rather from the ill uſe
made of books, than from their number.</p>
               <p>He complains—a complaint, I fear, which
muſt ever exiſt—that the preſs is continually
pouring forth trivial, crude, and uſeleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances:
yet he obſerves—'If men would
take care that ill books be not written, and that
good books be not ill written, but that in their
compoſition a due regard be always had to
<hi>prudence, ſolidity, perſpicuity,</hi> and <hi>brevity,</hi> there
would be no cauſe left for us to complain of
the too great number of books.'</p>
               <p>By the idea of <hi>prudence,</hi> he would have us
underſtand, that an Author ſhould never raſhly
or inconſiderately apply himſelf to compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
let him learn well what he purpoſes to
teach to others. The greateſt Scholars have
always taken time to make their compoſitions
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1020400300:250"/>
approach perfection. Iſocrates ſpent ten, or,
as ſome will have it, fifteen years, in poliſhing
one Panegyric. Dion Caſſius employed twelve
years in writing his Hiſtory, and ten years in
preparing his Memoirs. Virgil employed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years to finiſh his Bucolics; and, after a
labour of eleven years, pronounced his Aeneid
imperfect. Jacobus Sannazarius wrote three
books <hi>de Partu Virginis,</hi> and dedicated twenty
years to this labour. Diodorus Siculus was
thirty years in compoſing his Hiſtory. Hence
he adviſes writers to reflect on the reply of
Zeuxis to one who boaſted of a more fluent
hand in painting—<hi>Diu pingo, quia eternitati
pingo</hi>—'I paint but a line every day; but I
paint for poſterity.'</p>
               <p>In works of importance, he would have us
be ſtudious of what he calls <hi>ſolidity.</hi> He means,
that our arguments ſhould be forcibly urged,
and ſkilfully applied; that every thing we
write tend to ſhew that we feel ourſelves the
conviction of what we would convince our
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1020400300:251"/>
reader; that nothing be feeble, doubtful, or
frivolous; that truth be firm, clear, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable
as poſſible. 'Not,' as he candidly
remarks, 'that this <hi>ſolidity</hi> can be every where
obſerved alike, it being above the infirmity of
man ſo to do; but men ſhould be very wary
not to flatter themſelves that others will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their bare ſay-ſo's.'</p>
               <p>By <hi>perſpicuity,</hi> he requires that the ſtyle
ſerve like a mirror to the mind of the Author;
ſo that the ſenſe may be lucidly preſented to
the reader. As for thoſe Authors who are
pleaſed to throw over their compoſitions an
affected obſcurity, he ſhrewdly remarks, that
they might gratify their humour and the
world much better by remaining ſilent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he would not have <hi>perſpicuity</hi> ſo far
indulged as to neglect <hi>brevity.</hi> 'For, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
makes a book uſeleſs; ſo, if drawn out
in length, it becomes tedious.' To obſerve
this <hi>brevity,</hi> he adviſes the writer not to give
into wild digreſſions, but always 'to keep cloſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1020400300:252"/>
to his main ſubject;' to reject, as much as
poſſible, trite ſentiments and familiar argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
to be ſparing of an idle amplification
of words; and, in controverſy, not ſo much to
combat his adverſaries by number as by weight
of argument.</p>
               <p>To cloſe this ſlight Review, which, I hope,
will not be found unuſeful, he exhorts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
youth not to delight in a multiplicity
of authors; to be ſelect in his choice, and then
ſtudiouſly to unite himſelf to thoſe authors
whom he finds moſt congenial to his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
An excellent rule this! And, to
conclude with a verſe from the Earl of Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common—<q>To chuſe an Author as he would a Friend.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the benefit of young Authors, I will add
the advice of a Veteran on Publication—</p>
               <p>Menage obſerves, that the works which are
moſt <hi>generally</hi> liked, give a more extenſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
than the moſt excellent ones, which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1020400300:253"/>
are only reliſhed by a few connoiſſeurs. The
diſhes at a feaſt ſhould rather be ſeaſoned to the
taſte of the invited than to that of the cooks,
however able they may be: for, as Martial
ſays—<q>
                     <l>— Coenae fercula noſtrae</l>
                     <l>Malim Convivis, quam placuiſſe Cocis.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To give a work which may be crowned with
the approbation of the public, it muſt be read
<hi>three times:</hi> the firſt, perfectly to underſtand
it; the ſecond, to criticiſe it; and the third, to
correct it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="article">
               <head>VIRGIL.</head>
               <p>VIRGIL has violated the immutable laws
of common ſenſe, which exiſt in full force in
all ages, and in all countries, by his ridiculous
Miracles, which are not leſs inſupportable than
thoſe which the ancient Chroniclers relate of
their Saints. Among theſe, we may obſerve,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1020400300:254"/>
is that of transforming into the Leaves of a
Tree, of which Polydore is the Root, the Lances
with which Polymneſtor had pierced him in
the third book of the Aeneid; in making the
branch of a tree produce a Golden Bough, in
the ſixth; and in metamorphoſing into Sea
Nymphs, in the eleventh book, the Ships of
Aeneas, which were ſet on fire. The leaſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
of his admirers would even defend
theſe miracles: ſurely, theſe fictions are
not miraculous, but ridiculous, and only ſerve
to blemiſh ſo beautiful a compoſition!</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo condemn, in Virgil, that cruel
Piety by which he has diſtinguiſhed Aeneas, in
cauſing him to immolate eight perſons on the
funeral-pile of Pallas. The example of Homer,
which he has here followed, cannot excuſe a
barbarity which ſhocks our feelings. This
cruel action was characteriſtic of the furious
Achilles in the circumſtance of the death of
Patroclus, but ſhould not have been performed
by the pious Aeneas. Beſides, Virgil, who
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1020400300:255"/>
had more judgment than Homer, and who
lived in a more poliſhed age, is leſs excuſeable
in having made his Hero commit ſo barbarous
an action.</p>
               <p>In the fourth book of the Aeneid, we are
compelled to animadvert on another ſault,
which pains our ſenſibility. In that book,
where the Poet expreſſes ſo well the madneſs
of a deſpairing Lover, Aeneas appears by much
too cold; and his excuſes are, indeed, not very
ingenious for his deſertion of Dido—in a word,
not a little unfeeling. To all the reproaches
of the paſſionate and tender Queen he has
only to oppoſe the orders of Jupiter, and the
ſeverity of his ſate. He cannot doubt of the
extreme violence of her paſſion; and he muſt
neceſſarily know to what an exceſs a woman
of her fervid ſpirit, who pretended to be united
to him as his wife, would carry it: yet he <hi>ſleeps,</hi>
in the moſt perfect tranquillity, in his veſſel,
till Mercury awakens him.</p>
               <p>Some of his adventures ſeem copies of each
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1020400300:256"/>
other. Sinon and Acheminedes preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Trojans on two very different
occaſions, but in nearly a ſimilar manner.
The one in his ſecond book, and the other in
the third, ſay the ſame things. The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the tempeſts too frequently reſemble
each other; and they begin two or three times
by the ſame verſes. This beautiful verſe—<q>Obſtupui, Steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haeſit,</q>
is too often repeated. There are alſo <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>;
which, probably, he would have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
had he lived.</p>
               <p>He relates, in the fifth book, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the death of Palinurus in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and Palinurus himſelf, in the ſixth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
it differently. In one, it is the god of
Sleep, under the figure of Phorbas, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cauſed the pilot to fall aſleep, precipitates
him and the rudder into the ſea; in the other,
it is a gale of wind that carries them both
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1020400300:257"/>
away. In one place, Palinurus is ſwallowed
up in a profound ſleep by the ſea; in the other,
he is perfectly awake, and has time to reflect
that the ſhip will now wander without a pilot.</p>
               <p>Virgil ſhould not have cauſed Aeneas to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from Hell by the gate of <hi>Ivory,</hi> but by
that of <hi>Horn.</hi> By employing here the gate of
Ivory, from whence iſſued fables and fictions,
formed at pleaſure—<hi>Sed falſa ad Coelum mittunt
inſomnia manes</hi>—is it not deſtroying, at a ſingle
ſtroke, the whole that he has been recounting in
that incomparable book; and tacitly informing
Auguſtus, that all he had imagined moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
for him and his anceftors is nothing but
a mere idle fiction?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond book of the Aeneid, Aſcanius
appears a little child, led by the hand of his
father: he could not have attained to more
than ſeven years. In the third, Andromache,
calling to mind Aſtyanax her ſon, and addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
herſelf to Aſcanius, ſays—'Were he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1020400300:258"/>
living, he would now, like you, have reached
the age of puberty—<q>Et nunc aequali tecum pubeſceret oevo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Aſcanius was not, then, a child, before he
went to Africa? Yet Virgil makes him again
but ſeven years in his fourth book, when Dido
holds Cupid in her lap, who had aſſumed his
figure: yet, in the <hi>very ſame book,</hi> he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
not as a <hi>child,</hi> but as a young and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
<hi>man,</hi> in a hunting-match, of which he
gives a deſcription.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are very irregular and diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
contradictions which are very material,
and which cannot be reconciled. Virgil, on
his death-bed, commanded his friends to burn
his Aeneid. The great Poet was conſcious
of it's unfiniſhed ſtate. Fortunately for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
they did not in this reſpect obey the
injunctions of their dying friend. The loſs had,
indeed, been irreparable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1020400300:259"/>
Let it not be conſidered, that I have collected
theſe criticiſms to diminiſh the reputation of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil.
His laurels are placed for above the reach of
envy. I am no Lauder; no Heron; but it is alone
by an enlightened criticiſm, and by contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the errors of our Maſters, that we may
hope, if we but faintly attain to their beauties,
at leaſt to eſcape from their errors.</p>
               <p>We can, however, defend Virgil from a
cenſure which attacks at once the Poet and the
Man. The Cardinal Sirlet, Turnebus, Muret,
Taubman, Julius Scaliger, and others not leſs
eminent, are much aſtoniſhed that Virgil, in
his ſixth book of the Aeneid, deſcribing the
Laurel Grove which he has aſſigned for the
reſidence of the Poets, makes no mention
of Homer. On this they have taxed Virgil
with ingratitude and envy; ſince here an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
preſented itſelf ſo favourably to beſtow
a beautiful eulogium on Homer, to whom he
ſtood ſo deeply indebted; and they have been
aſtoniſhed why he preferred to do this honour
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1020400300:260"/>
to the ancient Muſaeus. But this cenſure is
very unjuſt, and could only be occaſioned by
not reflecting ſufficiently on the order of time.
Let us conſider, that Virgil only follows his
Hero: if he ſpeaks of Muſaeus, it is that he
had no other deſign but to mention thoſe
Poets who died before the taking of Troy.
He was too judicious, to cauſe Aeneas to relate
that he had ſeen Homer amongſt the Poets,
who was not born till at leaſt one hundred and
ſixty years after the deſtruction of Troy.</p>
               <p>Virgil, in the ſecond book of the Georgics,
has beſtowed high eulogiums on the fertile
territory of Nole, in Campania: but, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of this city not chuſing to allow their
waters to run through his lands, he eraſed
<hi>Nole,</hi> and put <hi>Ora</hi> in it's place. So dreadful
is the vengeance of a Poet!</p>
               <p>The Banquet which Alcinous gives Ulyſſes,
in the Odyſſey, is very beautiful, and perfectly
gallant: but it appears there are none but men
preſent. That with which Dido entertains
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1020400300:261"/>
Aeneas is not by any means comparable to it in
feſtal elegance. In one, they ſing the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Gods, and other themes, not leſs
agreeable than gallant: in the other, they ſing
concerning the ſtars, and other philoſophical
matters. Let the feſtive ſplendours of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinous
be removed to the Court of Carthage,
and the feaſt of Dido to the Pheacian Iſland;
and every thing will then be in character.</p>
               <p>To this article may be added an account of a
thirteenth book of the Aeneid. A Poet, named
<hi>Maphaeus Vegius Laudanenſis</hi>—ſo Naudé writes
it, but I obſerve his Commentator tells us it
ſhould be <hi>Laudenſis</hi>—was born at Lodi, in the
year 1407. At ſixteen years of age, he gave
evident marks of an excellent genius. What
is moſt remarkable of him, is, that he has with
great felicity added a thirteenth book to the
Aeneid. Has this book ever been tranſlated
into Engliſh verſe?</p>

               <head>MILTON.</head>
               <p>IT is painful to obſerve the acrimony which
the moſt eminent Scholars infuſe frequently
in their controverſial writings. The polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the preſent times has, in ſome degree,
ſoftened the malignity of the Man in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Author; though it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
there are living writers who pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on being—as they expreſs it—of the
Warburtonian School; but who diſplay the
aſperity rather than the erudition of a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton.</p>
               <p>The celebrated controverſy of <hi>Salmaſius</hi> and
<hi>Milton</hi>—the firſt, the advocate of King Charles;
the other, the defender of the People—was of
that magnitude, that all Europe took a part in
the paper-war of theſe two great men. The
anſwer of Milton, who perfectly maſſacred
Salmaſius, is now read but by the few. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is addreſſed to the times, however great
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1020400300:263"/>
may be it's merit, is doomed to periſh with
the times; yet, on theſe Pages, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
will not contemplate in vain.</p>
               <p>It will form no unintereſting article to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a few of the rhetorical <hi>weeds</hi>—for <hi>flowers</hi>
we cannot well call them—with which they
mutually preſented each other. Their rancour
was at leaſt equal to their condition, though
they were the two moſt learned Scholars of a
learned Age.</p>
               <p>That the deformity of the body is an idea
we attach to the deformity of the mind, the
vulgar muſt acknowledge; but ſurely it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
in the enlightened Philoſopher thus
to compare corporeal matter with intellectual
ſpirit: yet Milbourne and Dennis—the laſt a
formidable Critic—have frequently conſidered,
that comparing Dryden and Pope to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the eye turned from with diſguſt, was
very good argument to lower their literary
abilities. Salmaſius ſeems alſo to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this idea, though his ſpies in England
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1020400300:264"/>
gave him wrong information; or, poſſibly, he
only drew the figure of his own diſtempered
imagination.</p>
               <p>Salmaſius ſometimes reproaches Milton, as
being but a puny piece of Man; a dwarf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the human figure; a being compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of nothing but ſkin and bone; a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
pedagogue, fit only to flog his boys: and
ſometimes elevating the ardour of his mind
into a poetic frenzy, he applies to him theſe
words of Virgil—'<hi>Monſtrum horrendum, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
ingens, cui lumen ademptum.</hi>' Our
great Poet thought this ſenſeleſs declamation
merited a ſerious refutation; perhaps he did
not wiſh to appear deſpicable in the eyes of
the Ladies. If the great Johnſon could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his pleaſure at learning that Milton wore
latchets to his ſhoes, his admirers muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
in this deſcription of himſelf. He ſays,
that he does not think any one ever conſidered
him as unbeautiful; that his ſize rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
mediocrity than the diminutive; that he
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1020400300:265"/>
ſtill felt the ſame courage and the ſame ſtrength
which he poſſeſſed when young, when, with
his ſword, he felt no difficulty to combat with
men more robuſt than himſelf; that his face,
far from being pale, emaciated, and wrinkled,
did him much credit; for though he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his fortieth year, he was in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
ten years younger. For all this he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for teſtimony on multitudes; who, though
they knew him but by ſight, would hold him
ridiculous if he did not reveal the truth.</p>
               <p>Morus, in his Epiſtle Dedicatory of his
<hi>Clamor Regii Sanguinis,</hi> compares Milton to a
Hangman: his diſordered viſion to the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his ſoul; and vomits forth ſo much
rancour and venom, that to collect his calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
ceaſes to become an amuſive employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>When Salmaſius found that his ſtrictures
on the perſon of Milton were falſe, and that,
on the contrary, it was uncommonly beautiful,
he then turned his battery againſt thoſe graces
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1020400300:266"/>
with which Nature had ſo liberally adorned his
adverſary. And it is now that he ſeems to
have ſet no reſtrictions to his pen; but, rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the irritation of Milton's ſucceſs, he
throws out the blackeſt calumnies, and the
moſt infamous aſperſions.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, when Milton firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to anſwer Salmaſius, he had loſt the uſe
of one of his eyes; and his phyſicians declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if he applied himſelf to the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,
the other would likewiſe cloſe for ever!
His patriotiſm was not to be baffled but with
life itſelf. Unhappily, the prediction of his
phyſicians took place! Thus a learned man,
in the occupations of ſtudy, falls blind; a
circumſtance which even now agonizes the
heart of Senſibility. Salmaſius conſiders it as
one from which he may draw cauſtic ridicule,
and ſatiric ſeverity.</p>
               <p>Salmaſius glories that Milton loſt his health
and his eyes in anſwering his apology for
King Charles! He does not now reproach him
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1020400300:267"/>
with natural deformities; but he malignantly
ſympathizes with him, that he now no more is
in poſſeſſion of that beauty which rendered
him ſo amiable during his reſidence in <hi>Italy.</hi>
He ſpeaks more plainly in a following page;
and, in a word, would blacken the auſtere
virtue of Milton with a crime too infamous to
name.</p>
               <p>Impartiality of Criticiſm obliges us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that Milton was not deſtitute of rancour.
And, when it was told him that his adverſary
boaſted he had occaſioned the loſs of his eyes,
he anſwered, with the ferocity of the irritated
Puritan—'<hi>And I ſhall coſt him his life!</hi>' A
prediction which was ſoon after verified: for
Chriſtina, Queen of Sweden, withdrew her
patronage from Salmaſius, and ſided with
Milton. The univerſal neglect the proud Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
felt, in conſequence, haſtened his death.</p>
               <p>The ſtory of his expulſion from Cambridge
was not forgotten—nor forgotten to be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.
Milton denies this, and relates it in a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1020400300:268"/>
manner honourable to himſelf. Salmaſius aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
his reader, that thoſe who well knew
Milton affirm, that he was incapable of Latin
compoſition; but—in his manner of raillery—he confeſſes Milton to be an extraordinary Poet;
and this he maintains by pointing out how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he violates, in his Latin verſes, the
laws of quantity. He adds, that the Author
might have ſpared himſelf the pains of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his Age; for, without this aid, his
reader muſt have been convinced that they
were the compoſitions of the raw Scholar. To
cloſe the virulence of his invectives, he tells
us, that Milton's book is written by a French
ſchoolmaſter in London, and that he only lent
his name.</p>
               <p>What Patin writes in his Letters, in the
ſame times, will ſhew what lame reports the
enemies of Milton helped about. He writes—'Monſieur de la Mothe le Vaier informs me,
that the book of Milton againſt the King of
England has been burnt by the common
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1020400300:269"/>
hangman—in Paris: that Milton is in priſon;
and, it is to be hoped, will be hung. Some
ſay that Milton wrote this Book in Engliſh;
and that a Peter de Moulin, who has put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch fine Latin, is in danger, for his pains,
of being burnt.' This is in the uſual ſtyle of
Patin's correſpondence; ſome truth, with much
fiction. Moulin was a Confeſſor of the Royal
party; and was, on the contrary, a favourite
with our ſecond Charles; and who, having
written againſt the Rebels, was one of the few
whoſe fidelity he rewarded.</p>
               <p>It is raking in offals to tranſcribe from the
infamous <hi>Lauder.</hi> His virulence, however,
cannot now irritate; it may amuſe. He ſeems
to have poached in Salmaſius for Epithets.
His Pamphlets, with the common lyes of the
day, have met the common fate. The preſent
paragraph is an odd mixture of pedantry, of
vile compoſition, and viler abuſe.</p>
               <p>' Milton, whom the preſent generation of
Writers, if they do not on ſome occaſions
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1020400300:270"/>
                  <hi>exeem</hi> from ſome human frailties and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
have yet in the main conſpired to
daub with the <hi>untempered mortar</hi> of <hi>unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
praiſe. By repreſenting him as all perfect,
all excellent, without the leaſt mixture of alloy,
was rather <hi>a devil</hi> incarnate: an abandoned
<hi>Monſter</hi> of mankind, of inſatiable <hi>avarice,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
<hi>ambition,</hi> implacable <hi>malice,</hi> unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled
<hi>impudence,</hi> and ſhocking <hi>impiety.</hi>" Such
is the declamation which <hi>Lauder,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
day, had the audacity to acknowledge as
his own compoſition.</p>
               <p>We will cloſe this Article with Bayle's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of Milton's Controverſial Latin Writings,
for of no others he pretended to judge.
'Milton is very expert in the Latin language.
No one can deny that his ſtyle is flowing,
animated, and flowery; and that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the people adroitly and ingeniouſly.
But, without entering too deeply into this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it muſt be confeſſed, that his manner is
exceptionable; it is not ſufficiently ſerious for
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1020400300:271"/>
the importance of his ſubject. We ſee him
at every moment—I do not ſay pouring forth
ſharp railleries againſt Mr. Salmaſius; that
would not injure his Work, but gain the
laughers on his ſide—attempting to be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cical,
and to play off the buffoon. This cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
particularly extends to his two anſwers of
Mr. Morus. They are replete with outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
jeſts. The character of the Author here
appears without a maſk; he is one of thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiric
geniuſes, who, indeed, are too fond of
collecting all the diſadvantageous reports of
others, and of having written, by the enemies
of another, all the calumnies they know; but
who feel a greater gratification to inſert thoſe
calumnies in the firſt libel they publiſh againſt
any one.'</p>
               <p>I hope this heavy charge laid to our great
Poet is not juſt. He felt great provocations
from Salmaſius and Morus; and he was deeply
concerned in one of the greateſt political re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions.
Surely, the ſublime conceptions of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1020400300:272"/>
Milton could not deſcend to collect the tattle
of Scandal. To do this, one muſt have a mind
as little, and a heart as rancorous, as ſome of
our modern verſificators.</p>

               <p>IT is a melancholy contemplation, to reflect on
the ſtrange trials to which, in the remoter
ages, thoſe ſuſpected of guilt were put. The
Ordeal conſiſted of various kinds: walking
blindfold amidſt heated plough-ſhares; paſſing
through two fires; holding in the hand a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot
bar; and plunging the hand into boiling
water. Challenging the accuſer to ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
when frequently the ſtouteſt champion
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1020400300:275"/>
was allowed to ſupply their place; the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
a morſel of conſecrated bread; the
ſinking or ſwimming in a river for witchcraft;
and various others. Though ſometimes theſe
might be eluded by the artifice of the prieſt,
what numbers of innocent victims have been
ſacrificed to ſuch barbarous ſuperſtitions!</p>
               <p>In the twelfth century, they were very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Hildebert, Biſhop of Mans, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
of high-treaſon by our William Rufus,
was preparing to undergo one of theſe trials;
when Ives, Biſhop of Chartres, convinced him
that they were againſt the canons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of the church.</p>
               <p>An Abbot of Saint Aubin of Angers, who
lived in 1066, having refuſed to preſent a horſe
to the Viſcount of Touars, which the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
claimed in right of his lordſhip, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
an Abbot firſt took poſſeſſion of the
ſaid abbey; the Eccleſiaſtic offered to juſtify
himſelf by the trial of the ordeal, or by duel,
for which he propoſed to furniſh a man.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1020400300:276"/>
The Viſcount, at firſt, agreed to the duel; but,
reflecting that theſe combats, though ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the church, depended wholly on the ſkill
or vigour of the adverſary, and could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
afford no ſubſtantial proof of the equity
of his claim, he propoſed to compromiſe
the matter in a manner which ſtrongly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizes
the times: he waved his claim, on
condition that the Abbot ſhould not forget to
mention, in his prayers, himſelf, his wife, and
his brothers! As the <hi>oriſons</hi> appeared to the
Abbot, in compariſon with the <hi>horſe,</hi> of little
or no value, he accepted the propoſal.</p>
               <p>Pope Eugene approved of, and even intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
the trial by immerſion in cold water.</p>
               <p>It was about that time, alſo, that thoſe who
were accuſed of robbery, were put to trial by a
piece of barley bread, on which the maſs had
been ſaid; and, if they could not ſwallow it,
they were declared guilty. This mode of trial
was improved, by adding to the <hi>bread</hi> a ſlice
of <hi>cheeſe</hi>; and ſuch were the credulity and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1020400300:277"/>
firm dependence on Heaven in theſe ridiculous
trials, that they were very particular in the
compoſition of this holy <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>cheeſe.</hi>
The bread was to be of unleavened barley,
and the cheeſe made of ewe's milk of the
month of May, no other of the twelve months
having any power to detect a criminal.</p>
               <p>Du Cange has obſerved, that the expreſſion
we long have employed—'<hi>May this piece of
bread choak me!</hi>' comes from this cuſtom.</p>
               <p>The anecdote of Earl Godwin's death by
ſwallowing a piece of bread, in making this
aſſeveration, is recorded in our hiſtory. If it be
true, it was a ſingular misfortune.</p>
               <p>Voltaire ſays, that they were acquainted in
thoſe times with <hi>ſecrets</hi> to paſs, unhurt, theſe
ſingular trials. He particularly mentions one
for undergoing that of boiling water. Theſe
are his words—'The whole ſecret is ſaid to
conſiſt in rubbing one's ſelf a long time with
the ſpirit of vitriol and allum, together with
the juice of an onion. None of the Academies
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1020400300:278"/>
of Science, in our days, have attempted to

               <p>But, amongſt theſe trials, not the leaſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
was that of <hi>the bleeding of a corpſe.</hi> If
a perſon was murdered, it was ſaid that, at the

This was once allowed in England; and is
ſtill looked on, in ſome of the uncivilized parts
of theſe kingdoms, as a detection of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.
It forms a rich picture to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our old writers; and their narrations
and ballads are laboured into pathos by dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on this phenomenon. Yet, what is this
evidence in the eyes of the enlightened philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher?
It does not always happen in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the murderer; it bleeds ſuddenly in
that of the innocent: and is it not natural to
ſuppoſe, that 'when a body is full of blood,
warmed by a ſudden external heat, having
been conſiderably ſtirred or moved, and a

               <head>SINGULARITIES OBSERVED BY VARIOUS NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS
IN THEIR REPASTS.</head>
               <p>I HAVE collected from a very curious book,
entitled—'<hi>L'Eſprit des Uſages et des Coutumes,</hi>'
the greater part of the preſent article.</p>
               <p>The Maldivian Iſlanders eat alone. They
retire into the moſt hidden parts of their houſes;
and they draw down the cloths that ſerve as
blinds to their windows, that they may eat
unobſerved. This cuſtom probably ariſes—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
our philoſophic Author—from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,
in the early periods of ſociety, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf to eat: he fears that another, with
as ſharp an appetite, but more ſtrong than
himſelf, ſhould come and raviſh his meal from
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1020400300:280"/>
him. Beſides, the ideas of Witchcraft are wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpread among Barbarians; and they are not
a little fearful that ſome incantation may be
thrown amongſt their victuals.</p>
               <p>In noticing the ſolitary meal of the Maldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
Iſlander, another reaſon may be alledged
for this miſanthropical repaſt. They never will
eat with any one who is inferior to them in
birth, in riches, or dignity; and, as it is a
difficult matter to ſettle this equality, they are
condemned to lead this unſociable life.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the Iſlanders of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippines
are remarkably ſociable. Whenever
one of them finds himſelf without a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to partake of his meal, he runs till he
meets with one; and, we are aſſured, that
however keen his appetite may be, he ventures
not to ſatisfy it without a gueſt.</p>
               <p>Savages, (ſays Montaigne) when they eat,
'<hi>S'eſſuyent les doigts oux cuiſſes, à la bourſe des
génitoires, et à la plante des pieds.</hi>' It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to tranſlate this paſſage without offending
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1020400300:281"/>
feminine delicacy; nor can we forbear exulting
in the poliſhed convenience of napkins!</p>
               <p>The tables of the rich Chineſe ſhine with a
beautiful varniſh, and are covered with ſilk
carpets very elegantly worked. They do not
make uſe of plates, knives, or forks: every
gueſt has two little ivory or ebony ſticks, which
he handles very adroitly.</p>
               <p>The Otaheiteans, who are lovers of ſociety,
and very gentle in their manners, feed ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from each other. At the hour of repaſt,
the members of each family divide; two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
two ſiſters, and even huſband and wife,
father and mother, have each their reſpective
baſket. They place themſelves at the diſtance
of two or three yards from each other; they
turn their backs, and take their meal in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſilence.</p>
               <p>The cuſtom of drinking, at different hours
from thoſe aſſigned for eating, is to be met
with amongſt many ſavage nations. It was
originally begun from neceſſity. It became an
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1020400300:282"/>
habit, which ſubſiſted even when the fountain
was near to them. ''A people tranſplanted,'
obſerves our ingenious Philoſopher, 'preſerve,
in another climate, modes of living which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to thoſe from whence they originally
came. It is thus the Indians of Brazil ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly
abſtain from eating when they drink,
and from drinking when they eat.'</p>
               <p>When neither decency or politeneſs are
known, the man who invites his friends to a
repaſt, is greatly embarraſſed to teſtify his
eſteem for his gueſts, and to preſent them with
ſome amuſement; for the ſavage gueſt impoſes
on him this obligation. Amongſt the greater
part of the American Indians the hoſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
on the watch to ſolicit them to eat;
but touches nothing himſelf. In New France,
he wearies himſelf with ſinging, to divert the
company while they eat.</p>
               <p>When civilization advances, we wiſh to ſhew
our confidence to our friends: we treat them as
relations; and it is ſaid that, in China, the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1020400300:283"/>
maſter of the houſe, to give a mark of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs,
abſents himſelf while his gueſts regale
themſelves at his table in undiſturbed revelry.</p>
               <p>The demonſtrations of friendſhip, in a rude
ſtate, have a ſavage and groſs character, which
it is not a little curious to obſerve. The Tartars
pull a man by the ear, to preſs him to drink;
and they continue tormenting him till he opens
his mouth. It is then they clap their hands,
and dance before him.</p>
               <p>No cuſtoms ſeem more ridiculous than thoſe
practiſed by a Kamtſchadale, when he wiſhes
to make another his friend. He firſt invites
him to eat. The hoſt and his gueſt ſtrip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a cabin, which is heated to an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
degree. While the gueſt devours the food
with which they ſerve him, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
ſtirs the fire. The ſtranger muſt bear
the exceſs of the heat as well as of the repaſt.
He vomits ten times before he will yield; but,
at length, obliged to acknowledge himſelf
overcome, he begins to compound matters.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1020400300:284"/>
He purchaſes a moment's reſpite by a preſent
of cloaths or dogs; for his hoſt threatens to
heat the cabin, and to oblige him to eat till he
dies. The ſtranger has the right of retaliation
allowed to him: he treats in the ſame manner,
and exacts the ſame preſents. Should his hoſt
not accept the invitation of his gueſt, whom he
has ſo handſomely regaled, he would come
and inhabit his cabin till he had obtained from
him the preſents he had in ſo ſingular a manner
given to him.</p>
               <p>For this extravagant cuſtom a curious reaſon
has been alledged. It is meant to put the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to a trial whoſe friendſhip is ſought. The
Kamtſchadale, who is at the expence of the
fires and the repaſt, is deſirous to know if the
ſtranger has the ſtrength to ſupport pain with
him, and if he is generous enough to ſhare
with him ſome part of his property. While
the gueſt is employed on his meal, he continues
heating the cabin to an inſupportable degree;
and, for a laſt proof of the ſtranger's conſtancy
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1020400300:285"/>
and attachment, he exacts more cloaths and
more dogs. The hoſt paſſes through the ſame
ceremonies in the cabin of the ſtranger; and
he ſhews, in his turn, with what degree of
fortitude he can defend his friend. It is thus
the moſt ſingular cuſtoms would appear ſimple,
if it were poſſible for the Philoſopher to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
them on the ſpot.</p>
               <p>As a diſtinguiſhing mark of their eſteem, the
Negroes of Ardra drink out of one cup at the
ſame time. The King of Loango eats in one
houſe, and drinks in another. A Kamtſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale
kneels before his gueſt; he cuts an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
ſlice from a ſea-calf; he crams it entire
into the mouth of his friend, furiouſly crying
out—'<hi>Tana!</hi>—There!' and, cutting away
what hangs about his lips, ſnatches and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
it with avidity.</p>
               <p>A barbarous magnificence attended the feaſts
of the ancient Monarchs of France. We are
informed that, after their coronation or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1020400300:286"/>

having ſent Dominic, with ſome miſſionaries,

of them were aſſaſſinated at Toulouſe, in the
year 1200. It was then he called in for aid
temporal arms, and publiſhed againſt them

on ſimilar occaſions, all kinds of indulgences
and pardons to thoſe who ſhould arm againſt
theſe <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as he ſtiled theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
men. Raimond, Count of Toulouſe,
was conſtrained to ſubmit. The inhabitants
were paſſed on the edge of the ſword, without

for having conſidered that, though

might remain numbers who would profeſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

               <p>It was as late as the year 1484 that it became
known in Spain. It was alſo to a Dominican,
John de Torquemada, that the Court of Rome
owed this obligation. As he was the Confeſſor
of Queen Iſabella, he had extorted from her a
promiſe that, if ever ſhe aſcended the throne,
ſhe would uſe every means to extirpate Hereſy
and Heretics. Ferdinand had conquered Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,
and had chaced from the Spaniſh realms
multitudes of unfortunate Moors. A few had
remained; who, with the Jews, he obliged to
become Chriſtians: they at leaſt aſſumed the
name; but it was well known that both theſe

rather than thoſe of the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Torquemada pretended that this diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would greatly hurt the intereſts of the
Holy Religion. The Queen liſtened with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful
diffidence to her Confeſſor; and, at
length, gained over the King to conſent to the

               <p>' A man was ſeen with a profundity of mind
that exceeds our belief. As finiſhed a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
as he was a ſkilful Politician; capable of
undertaking any thing, and of concealing what
he undertook; equally indefatigable and
active in peace as in war; who left nothing
to Fortune which he could ſeize from her by

the advantage of being given by one who was
a witneſs to what he obſerves—</p>
               <p>' He was gentle and cruel when either was
neceſſary for his intereſts. He had no faith
in religion, no honour in his profeſſions, no
fidelity to his friends, than as the ſemblance
of theſe virtues ſerved towards his aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He knew better than any man to put
into practice all the pious grimaces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating
manners of the falſe votariſts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and to conceal, under an humble air
and popular addreſs, an unmeaſurable ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In a word, he poſſeſſed, in the ſupreme
degree, all the qualities of a great Politician;
and there was nothing wanting to compleat
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1020400300:300"/>
his good fortune, but to have acquired his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

               <p>THE origin of many, probably of moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions,
was in the endeavour to conceal ſome
deformity of the inventor. Thus Charles the
Seventh, of France, introduced Long Coats, to
hide his ill-made legs. Shoes, with very long
points, full two feet in length, were invented
by Henry Plantaganet, Duke of Anjou, to
conceal a very large excreſcence which he had
upon one of his feet.</p>

                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:1020400300:306"/>
Sometimes, Faſhions are quite reverſed in
one age from thoſe of another. Thus Bags,
when firſt in faſhion in France, were only wore
<hi>en diſhabille.</hi> In viſits of ceremony, the hair
was tied in a ribband, and floated over the
ſhoulders—all which is exactly contrary to our
preſent faſhion. Queen Iſabella, of Bavaria,
as remarkable for her gallantry as the fairneſs
of her complexion, introduced a faſhion of
leaving the ſhoulders and part of the neck un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>In England, about the reign of Henry the
Fourth, they wore long-pointed Shoes, to ſuch
an immoderate length, that they could not
walk till they were faſtened to their knees
with chains. Luxury improving on this ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
mode, it was the cuſtom of an Engliſh
Beau of the fourteenth century to have theſe
chains of gold or ſilver. A very accurate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of one of this deſcription may be found
in Henry's Hiſtory of Great Britain, in his
chapter on Manners, &amp;c. Vol. IV. The

               <p>To this article, as it may probably arreſt
the volatile eye of our fair Reader, we add
what may ſerve as a hint for the heightening
of her charms. Tacitus remarks of <hi>Poppea,</hi>
the Queen of Nero, that ſhe concealed <hi>a part</hi>

               <p>TITLES frequently remain when the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

few know why the Ottoman Emperor is called
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1020400300:308"/>

This was the occaſion. Mahomet the

that this ſplendid title was accorded to
him, but to the vaſt extent of his dominions,
in compariſon with thoſe of the Sultan of
Iconia, or Cappadocia, his contemporary, who
was diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi>The Little

               <p>THE preſent article, which I have drawn
from Abbé Raynal, preſents two pictures of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1020400300:309"/>
the debaſement of the human race, which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
Hiſtory has never paralleled.</p>
               <p>' There is a tribe amongſt the Indians which
is the refuſe of the reſt. The members of it
are employed in the meaneſt offices of ſociety.
They bury the dead, carry away dirt, and live
upon the fleſh of animals that <hi>die natural
deaths.</hi> They are prohibited from entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>temples</hi> and public <hi>markets</hi>; neither are
they allowed the uſe of <hi>the wells,</hi> that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all their inhabitants. Their dwellings
are at the <hi>extremity</hi> of the towns, or conſiſt of
<hi>ſolitary</hi> cottages in the country; and they are
even <hi>forbidden to appear in the ſtreets</hi> where
the Bramins reſide. As all other Indians, they
may employ themſelves in the labours of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture:
but only for the benefit of <hi>the other
tribes</hi>; for they are not permitted to have lands
of their own, not even upon leaſe. Such is
the degree of horror they excite, that if, by
chance, they were <hi>to touch any one</hi> not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their tribe, they would be deprived, with
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:1020400300:310"/>
impunity, of <hi>a life</hi> reckoned too abject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the protection of the laws. Moſt of them
are employed in the culture of rice. Near the
fields where they carry on this work, there is
a kind of hut, into which they retire when they
hear <hi>a cry,</hi> which always comes from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to give them notice of ſome order from
the perſon on whom they depend; to which
they anſwer, not coming out of their retreat.
They take the ſame precautions whenever
they are warned, by a confuſed kind of noiſe,
of the approach of <hi>any man</hi> whatever. If they
have not time to hide themſelves, they fall
<hi>proſtrate</hi> on the ground, with their faces down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
with all the marks of humiliation
which the ſenſe of their diſgrace can ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>' Whenever the harveſts do not anſwer to the
avidity of an oppreſſive maſter, he ſometimes
cruelly <hi>ſets fire</hi> to the huts of theſe unhappy
labourers; and if they <hi>attempt</hi> to eſcape the
flames, <hi>he fires upon them</hi> without mercy! The
condition of theſe wretched people is horrible
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1020400300:311"/>
in every reſpect, even in <hi>the manner</hi> in which
they are forced to provide for their moſt <hi>urgent
wants.</hi> In the duſk of the evening, they come
out from their retreats in bands; they direct
their ſteps towards the market, at a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from which they begin <hi>to bellow!</hi> The
merchants approach; and they aſk for what
they want. They are ſupplied, and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are laid on the very ſpot where the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
deſtined for the payment of them has been
previouſly depoſited. When <hi>the purchaſers</hi>
can be aſſured that they ſhall not be ſeen by
any one, they come out from behind the hedge
where they had <hi>concealed</hi> themſelves, and carry
away, with <hi>precipitation,</hi> what they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in ſo ſingular a manner.'</p>
               <p>After contemplating this diſhonourable pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man, (a degeneracy in Human Nature
which probably the reader could hardly ſuſpect)
he may deepen the philoſophic reverie by what
the Abbé gives us in continuation.</p>
               <p>' Yet this very tribe of <hi>Pouliats</hi> have <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:1020400300:312"/>
one among themſelves, called <hi>Pouliches.</hi>
Theſe laſt are forbidden the uſe of fire; they
are not permitted to build huts, but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the neceſſity of living in a kind of <hi>neſt
upon the trees,</hi> or in the foreſts. When preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with hunger, they <hi>howl</hi> like wild beaſts, to
excite compaſſion. The moſt charitable then
depoſit ſome rice, or other food, at the foot of
a tree, and <hi>retire</hi> with all poſſible haſte to give
the famiſhed wretch an opportunity of taking
it without meeting with his benefactor, who
would think himſelf polluted by coming near
him.'</p>
               <p>To clear up this curious information, which
ſtretches to the utmoſt the belief of the reader,
the Abbé preſents us with an excellent philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
argument. 'This extreme diſgrace,' he
ſays, 'into which a conſiderable part of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
nation is plunged, has always appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an inexplicable circumſtance. Men of the
utmoſt ſagacity have never been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how a people, humane and ſenſible,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:1020400300:313"/>
could have brought themſelves to reduce their
own brethren to ſo abject a ſtate. To ſolve
this difficulty, let us be permitted to hazard a
conjecture. In our half barbarous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
dreadful torments, or an ignominious
death, are allotted to thoſe criminals who have
diſturbed, in a greater or leſs degree, the peace
of ſociety. May we not therefore reaſonably
ſuppoſe that, in the ſoft climate of India, a
more moderate ſyſtem of legiſlature may have
been ſatisfied with <hi>excluding</hi> from their tribes
all kinds of malefactors? This puniſhment
muſt appear to them ſufficient to put a ſtop to
the commiſſions of ſuch crimes; and it was
certainly the beſt adapted to a country where
the effuſion of blood was always forbidden
by religious as well as moral principles. It
would certainly have been a very proper cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
if <hi>the children</hi> had not inherited the
infamy of their parents: but there were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furmountable
prejudices which militated againſt
this reinſtatement; a family never being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1020400300:314"/>
again into a tribe after it had been once
expelled from it.'</p>
               <p>The ſolution of the Abbé is ingenious and
probable: but the Moſaic threat of vengeance
extending to the third and fourth generation, is
uncongenial to the mild ſpirit of humane philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.
Yet is this threat on record in thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
which are ſaid to have been written
by the finger of God himſelf. Surely this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
accord with the unwearied benevolence of
a paternal Deity! Let us rather acknowledge,
with a ſigh, that there are multitudes of the
human race who really believe themſelves to
be the property of a ſmall number of men who
oppreſs them. The image of the Creator is ſo
debaſed in ſome parts of the globe, that it may
be ſaid, the hand of the oppreſſor has effaced
every mark of it's original greatneſs.</p>

               <head>'KING OF ENGLAND, FRANCE, &amp;c.'</head>
               <p>NOTHING can be more empty and ridiculous
than the title which our Monarchs aſſume of
'<hi>The King of France.</hi>' It would characterize
a great Prince to eraze from his true honours
this fictitious one. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarch ſhould
not ſuffer his dignity to be expoſed to the ſmile
of the Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>Charpentier very temperately ſtates the only
two principles by which our Kings can aſſume
this title. The firſt, from Edward the Third
being ſon of Iſabella of France, who was ſiſter
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1020400300:319"/>
to three Kings of France—Louis Hutin, Philip
the Long, and Charles the Fair, who died
without children. So that Edward, their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
diſputed the crown of France with
<hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> on the foundation of the
Salique Law, which had never yet been agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.
This law ſays, that the kingdom of
France <hi>ne tombant point en quenouille</hi>: <hi>i. e.</hi>
'the ſceptre of France ſhall never degenerate
into a diſtaff.' The children of the daughters
of France can never ſucceed to it. As the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Monarchs of England are not deſcendants
of this <hi>Edward,</hi> they cannot have any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to the crown of France, if it had not
been a maxim with them, that the rights once
devolved on the crown are for ever unalienable
and impreſcriptible. The ſecond principle is,
the donation which Charles the Sixth made of
the Crown of France to our Henry the Fifth,
his ſon-in-law, to the excluſion of his ſon
Charles the Seventh.</p>
               <p>We may add, here, that Cromwell offered
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1020400300:320"/>
to ſell Cardinal Mazarine all the vouchers for
France which are preſerved in the Tower, for
a hundred thouſand crowns. It was at this
price he rated the claims of England to the
Crown of France; but the Cardinal wiſely
deemed even that ſum too high a price.</p>
               <p>If it be a maxim with our crown, of which
I am ignorant, that the rights once devolved
upon it, are unalienable and impreſcriptible, it
may be ſaid that we poſſeſs the United States
of America; but, I believe, this ſovereignty
would not be ſo eaſily permitted as that of the
French monarchy.</p>

               <p>Here is another to be added to this liſt. In

Portugal. His body is interred at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers,

Maria. Nothing on earth was capable of
obliging this Prince to renounce his crown.
He paſſed over to England, and came to
France, where he reſided; and died, in great
poverty, at the age of ſixty-four years. This
dethroned Monarch was happy in one thing,
which is indeed rare. In all his miſeries,

he had a ſervant, who proved a tender and

he only wiſhed to be buried at the feet of
his dear maſter. This hero in loyalty, to whom

who had been treated unfortunately by Nature,
that ſhe could not endure their preſence.</p>

not be diſpleaſed to attend to the following

               <p>Thomas Parr was born in the laſt year of
King Edward the Fourth, anno 1483. He
married his firſt wife, Jane, at eighty years of
age; and, in above thirty years, ſhe brought
him but two children, the eldeſt of which did
not live above three years. He married his
ſecond wife, Catherine, when he was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty years of age, by whom he
had one child. He lived till he had attained
to ſomething above one hundred and fifty years
of age. Thomas, Earl of Arundel, cauſed
him to be brought to Weſtminſter about two
months before his death: there he paſſed
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:1020400300:336"/>
moſt of his time in ſleep; and an ocular wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                     <l>From head to heel, his body had, all over,</l>
                     <l>A quickſet, thickſet, nat'ral, hairy cover.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſuppoſed this removal, by taking him
from his native air, and the diſturbance of
much company, haſtened his death. He died
there, November 15, 1634, in the ninth year
of King Charles the Firſt, and was buried in
the Abbey.</p>
               <p>Henry Jenkins lived till he was an hundred
and ſixty-nine years of age. A remarkable
circumſtance diſcovered the age of this man.
Being ſworn a witneſs in a cauſe of an hundred
and twenty years, the judge could not help
reproving him, till he ſaid he was <hi>then</hi> butler
to the Lord Conyers; and, at length, his name
was found in ſome old regiſter of the Lord
Conyers's menial ſervants. Dr. Tancred Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon,
who ſent the account of this man to
the Royal Society, adds farther, that Henry
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1020400300:337"/>
Jenkins, coming into his ſiſter's kitchen to beg
an alms, he aſked him, how old he was? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little pauſing, he ſaid, he was about one
hundred and ſixty-two or three. The Doctor
aſked him, what Kings he remembered? He
ſaid, 'Henry the Eighth.' What public things
he could longeſt remember? He ſaid, 'The
fight at Flowden Field.' Whether the King
was there? He ſaid, 'No, he was in France,
and the Earl of Surrey was General.' How
old he was then? He ſaid, 'About twelve
years old.' The Doctor inſpected an old Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
that was in the houſe, and found that the
Battle of Flowden Field was one hundred and
fifty-two years before; that the Earl he named
was General; and that Henry the Eighth was
then at Tournay.</p>
               <p>Jenkins was a poor man, and could neither
write nor read. He died December the 8th,
1670.</p>

               <p>THE Feudal government introduced a ſpecies
of ſervitude which till that time was unknown,
and which was called the Servitude of the
Land. The Bondmen, or Villains, did not
reſide in the houſe of the Lord: but they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
depended on his caprice; and he ſold
them, as he did the animals, with the field
where they lived, and which they cultivated.</p>
               <p>It is difficult to conceive with what inſolence
the petty Lords of thoſe times tyrannized over
their Villains: they not only oppreſſed their
ſlaves with unremitted labour, inſtigated by a
vile cupidity; but their whim and caprice led
them to inflict miſeries without even any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

               <p>In Scotland, they had a right to enjoy the

               <p>Others, to preſerve this privilege when they
could not enjoy it in all it's extent, thruſt their
leg, booted, into the bed of the new-married

to paſs the firſt night at the top of a tree, and
there to conſummate the marriage; to paſs the
bridal hours in a river; to be bound naked to
a cart, and to trace ſome furrows as they were
dragged; or to leap, with their feet tied, over
the horns of ſtags.</p>
               <p>Sometimes their caprice commanded the
bridegroom to appear in drawers at their caſtle,
and plunge into a ditch of mud; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they were compelled to beat the waters
of the ponds, to hinder the frogs from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing
the Lord!</p>
               <p>There was a time when the German Lords
reckoned, amongſt their privileges, that of
robbing on the highways of their territory!</p>
               <p>I beg leave to remind the reader of the

ſhameful behaviour of Geoffrey, Lord of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,

that, by this mode, he might reſtore to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

               <head>GAMING.</head>
               <p>GAMING appears to be an univerſal paſſion.
Some have attempted to deny it's univerſality;
they have imagined that it is chiefly prevalent
in cold climates, where ſuch a paſſion becomes
moſt capable of agitating and gratifying the
torpid minds of their inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But, if we lay aſide ſpeculation, and turn
to facts, we are ſurely warranted in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that, as the love of Gaming proceeds
from a varice—that diſhonourable paſſion which,
probably, for ſome wiſe purpoſes, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial
to the human heart—it is not unjuſt to
conclude, that it exiſts with equal force in
human nature; and, conſequently, the fatal
propenſity of Gaming is to be diſcovered, as
well amongſt the inhabitants of the frigid and
torrid zones, as amongſt thoſe of the milder cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.
The ſavage and the civilized, the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
and the learned, are alike captivated with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:1020400300:344"/>
the hope of accumulating wealth without the
labours of induſtry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore has lately given to the Public
an elaborate Work, which profeſſedly treats of
the three moſt important topics which a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the preſent day can diſcuſs—Suicide,
Gaming, and Duelling. He has collected a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of inſtances of this deſtructive paſſion
being prevalent in all nations; and I ſhall juſt
notice thoſe which appear moſt ſingular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dice,</hi> and that little pugnacious animal the
<hi>Cock,</hi> are the chief inſtruments employed by
the numerous nations of the Eaſt, to agitate
their minds and ruin their fortunes; to which
the Chineſe—who are deſperate gameſters—add
the uſe of <hi>Cards.</hi> When all other property
is played away, the Aſiatic gambler ſcruples
not to ſtake his <hi>wife,</hi> or his <hi>child,</hi> on the caſt of
a die, or courage and ſtrength of a martial
bird. If ſtill unſucceſsful, the laſt venture he
ſtakes is, <hi>himſelf!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Iſland of Ceylon, <hi>cock-fighting</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:1020400300:345"/>
to a great height. The Sumatrans are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the uſe of dice. A ſtrong ſpirit of
play characterizes a Malayan. After having
reſigned every thing to the good fortune of the
winner, he is reduced to a horrid ſtate of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration;
he then looſens a certain lock of
hair, which indicates war and deſtruction to all
the raving gameſter meets. He intoxicates
himſelf with opium; and, working himſelf up
into a fit of phrenzy, he bites and kills every
one who comes in his way. But, as ſoon as
ever this lock is ſeen flowing, it is <hi>lawful</hi> to
fire at the perſon, and to deſtroy him as faſt as
poſſible. I think it is this which our ſailors
call, 'To run a muck.' Thus Dryden writes—<q>
                     <l>Frontleſs, and ſatire-proof, he ſcours the ſtreets,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>runs</hi> an Indian <hi>Muck</hi> at all he meets.</l>
                  </q> Thus alſo Pope—<q>
                     <l>Satire's my weapon, but I'm too diſcreet</l>
                     <l>To <hi>run a Muck,</hi> and tilt at all I meet.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon could not diſcover the derivation of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:1020400300:346"/>
the word <hi>Muck.</hi> I think I have heard that
it refers to their employing, on theſe fatal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
a <hi>muck,</hi> or lance; but my recollection
is, probably, imperfect.</p>
               <p>To diſcharge their gambling debts, the
Siameſe ſell their poſſeſſions, their families,
and, at length, themſelves. The Chineſe play
<hi>night</hi> and <hi>day,</hi> till they have loſt all they are
worth; and then they uſually go and hang
themſelves. Such is the propenſity of the
Japaneſe for high play, that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to make a law, that 'Whoever ventures
his money at play, ſhall be put to death.' In
the newly-diſcovered iſlands of the Pacific
Ocean, they venture even their hatchets, which
they hold as invaluable acquiſitions, on running
matches. 'We ſaw a man,' as Cooke writes
in his laſt voyage, 'beating his breaſt, and
tearing his hair, in the violence of rage, for
having loſt three hatchets at one of theſe races,
and which he had purchaſed with nearly half
his property.'</p>

               <head>THE ATHENIANS.</head>
               <p>MARVILLE has given this pleaſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Athenians—</p>
               <p>' The Greeks were ſo poliſhed a nation, that
they treated others as rude and barbarous;
but, of all the Greeks, the Athenians poſſeſſed
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:1020400300:348"/>
a more refined delicacy in the politer Arts, and
an exquiſite taſte for Eloquence. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Orators who aroſe amongſt them had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized
them with the moſt perfect beauties
of compoſition.</p>
               <p>' Pericles, whoſe eloquence they compared to
lightnings and thunders, had ſo accuſtomed
their minds to ſuffer nothing but what was
pure, elegant, and finiſhed, that thoſe who had
to ſpeak in public, looked upon the loweſt of
the people as ſo many cenſurers of what they
were going to ſay. But, if the genius of this
people had become ſo delicate by the attic elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of their Orators, the native haughtineſs
of the Greeks was much increaſed by their
ſervile adulation; ſo that it required a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dexterity to ſtretch the empire of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
over men who always would be treated
like maſters.</p>
               <p>' The eſtabliſhment of the ſingular law of
<hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> which was occaſioned by the tyranny
of Piſiſtratus, cauſed a double increaſe of pride
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:1020400300:349"/>
to this people, who were already ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Thus runs the ſentence of this famous
law—"Let no one of us excel the others; and,
if there ſhould be one found of this deſcription,
let him go and excel elſewhere." By this law,
thoſe whoſe great merit and high reputation
gave umbrage to their citizens, were baniſhed
for ten years.</p>
               <p>' It was, in it's commencement, obſerved
with ſo much rigour, that Ariſtides, who was
ſurnamed <hi>The Juſt,</hi> and who had performed ſo
many great actions for the glory of his country,
was condemned to baniſhment: and, although
this ſeverity had greatly abated of it's rigour
under Alcibiades, and that it was aboliſhed in
the courſe of time; there remained, in the
manners and minds of the Athenians, a
great jealouſy of thoſe who had diſtinguiſhed
themſelves by ſome extraordinary merit; and
a rigorous ſeverity towards their Orators, which
conſtrained them to be very circumſpect. The
rules they had impoſed on them went ſo far
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:1020400300:350"/>
as to prohibit their diſplaying ornaments too
elaborate, which might diſguiſe their real
ſentiments—images and motions, capable of
affecting and ſoftening their auditors—for they
regarded the firſt as falſe lights, that might
miſlead their reaſon; and the latter, as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to encroach on their liberty, by ſwaying
their paſſions. It is to this we muſt attribute
that coldneſs and auſterity which pervade the
diſcourſes of theſe Orators, and which rather
proceeded from the reſtraint laid on them than
from the qualities of their genius.</p>
               <p>' Beſides that the Athenians were haughty,
jealous of their power, and auſtere towards
their Orators, they had an impatience, and a
volatility of diſpoſition, which occaſioned
them frequently to paſs from one extreme to
another, by ſudden and unexpected reſolutions,
and often broke all the meaſures and ſchemes
of thoſe who attempted to gain them over to
their ſentiments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:1020400300:351"/>
' A hand raiſed, or a loud cry from ſome
factious perſon, in an aſſembly, was often the
ſignal for an advice that was to be diſcloſed, or
of a counſel which was to be taken: and as it
happens, that thoſe who are the moſt inſolent
when they command, are the moſt ſupple when
they obey; the Athenians, who had been ſo
haughty during the proſperity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public,
were the moſt abject ſlaves to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
of Alexander; and afterwards to the
Romans, when they became their maſters.
This feeble people had, in the bottom of their
hearts, a fund of meanneſs and of timidity,
which made them conſtrain their Orators to
conform themſelves to their manners and their
genius. To ſucceed with them, it became
neceſſary to appear to reſpect them, whilſt
they taught them to fear; to flatter and to
cenſure them, at the ſame time—a policy
which Demoſthenes, who well knew this
people, with great ſucceſs ſo ſkilfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:1020400300:352"/>
' This people has, however, produced great
men, and in great numbers; but they had ſo
ſeldom a ſhare in the public reſolutions, that
their merit, of which they have left ſo many
illuſtrious teſtimonies, cannot, however, make
a general rule to judge of the character of this
people.'</p>
               <p>To this ingenious diſcrimination of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Athenians, I cannot forbear tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
an animated deſcription of their luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
carried to ſuch an exceſs of refinement,
and opulent elegance, that thoſe who are fond
of cenſuring our modern diſſipations, may be
reminded, that we have never yet approached
thoſe of the Grecians or the Romans. It is
extracted from Dr. Gillies's Hiſtory of Greece.</p>
               <p>' Inſtead of the bread, herbs, and ſimple
fare, recommended by the Laws of Solon,
the Athenians, ſoon after the 80th Olympiad,
availed themſelves of their extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
to import the delicacies of diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
which were prepared by all the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:1020400300:353"/>
of cookery. The wines of Cyprus were
cooled with ſnow in ſummer; in winter, the
moſt delightful flowers adorned the tables and
perſons of the wealthy Athenians. Nor was it
ſufficient to be crowned with roſes, unleſs
they were likewiſe anointed with the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
perfumes. Paraſites, dancers, and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons,
were an uſual appendage of every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
Among the weaker ſex, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for delicate birds, diſtinguiſhed by their
voice or plumage, was carried to ſuch exceſs,
as merited the name of madneſs. The bodies
of ſuch youths as were not addicted to hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and horſes, which began to be a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taſte, were corrupted by a commerce of
barlots, who had reduced their profeſſion into
<hi>ſyſtem,</hi> while their minds were ſtill more pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
by the licentious philoſophy of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts.
It is unneceſſary to croud the picture;
vices and extravagance took root in Athens in
an adminiſtration the moſt ſplendid and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:1020400300:354"/>
Perhaps, this laſt obſervation is cleared up
by the remarks of Marville; for it appears
that, although at the helm of adminiſtration
ſat ſuch illuſtrious characters, they had little
or no ſhare in the adminiſtration, ſince the
haughtineſs and volatility of the Athenians
were ſuch, that they would not even bear the
reprimands of their Orators.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that even the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics
in Athens poſſeſſed a claſſic taſte, and a
niceneſs of ear, which could only be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a general diffuſion of national ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.
For an anecdote of their <hi>Atticiſm,</hi> take

               <p>Philip of Macedon, in the preſent age,
would have merited the title of a Claſſical

without accompanying it by an oration. While
he was holding his diſcourſe to the people, he
committed a ſoleciſm in language, which the

When Sigiſmond, King of Sweden, was
elected King of Poland, he made a treaty with
the States of Sweden, by which he obliged
himſelf to paſs every fifth year in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
In the courſe of time, being conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the wars he had with the Ottoman Court,
with Muſcovy, and Tartary, to remain in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to animate, by his preſence, the wars he
held with ſuch powerful enemies; he failed,
during fifteen years, of accompliſhing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
To remedy this, in ſome ſhape, by the
advice of the Juſuits, who had gained the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
over him, he created a Senate, which was
to reſide at Stockholm, compoſed of forty cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Jeſuits, to decide on every affair of ſtate.
He publiſhed a declaration in their favour; and
preſented them with letters-patent, by which
he clothed them with the Royal authority.</p>
               <p>While this ſenate of Jeſuits was at Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zic,
waiting for a fair wind to ſet ſail for Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,

the uncle of Sigiſmond, the Prelates, and the
Lords, reſolved to prepare for them a ſplendid

               <p>But, in a private Council, they came to very

could not bear that a Senate of Prieſts ſhould
command, in preference to all the honours and

the Prince of Bithynia, addreſſing himſelf to
Prince Charles, uncle of the King, ſaid—'I
own no other King than you; and I believe
you are now obliged to receive us as your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
ſubjects, and to aſſiſt us to chaſe theſe
vermin from the ſtate.' All the others joined
him, and acknowledged Charles as their lawful
Monarch.</p>
               <p>Having reſolved to keep their declaration for
ſome time ſecret, they deliberated in what
manner they were to receive and to precede
this Senate in their entry into the harbour,
who were on board a great galleon, which they
had cauſed to caſt anchor two leagues from
Stockholm, that they might enter more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
in the night, when the fire-works
they had prepared would appear to the greateſt
advantage. About the time of their reception,
Prince Charles, accompanied by twenty-five
or thirty veſſels, appeared before the Senate.
Wheeling about, and forming a caracol of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:1020400300:361"/>
ſhips, they diſcharged a volley, and emptied
all their cannon on the galleon of this Senate,
which had it's ſides pierced through with the
balls. The galleon was immediately filled
with water, and ſunk, without one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Jeſuits being aſſiſted; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they cried to them, that this was the
time to perform ſome miracle, ſuch as they
were accuſtomed to do in India and Japan;
and, if they choſe, they could walk on the
waters!</p>
               <p>The report of the cannon, and the ſmoke
which the powder occaſioned, prevented either
the cries or the ſubmerſion of the Holy Fathers
from being obſerved: and, as if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
the Senate to the town, Charles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
triumphantly; went into the church,
where they ſung <hi>Te Deum</hi>; and, to conclude
the night, he partook of the entertainment
which had been prepared for the ill-fated
Senate.</p>

The Jeſuits of the city of Stockholm hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

who had cauſed the Senate to periſh.
They ſolicited the people to rebel; but they

made a public profeſſion of Lutheraniſm.</p>
               <p>Sigiſmond, King of Poland, began a war

proceeding from an exceſs of malevolence, or
an exceſs of patriotiſm. This paſſion cannot

have ever been a nation of haughty barbarians.
It cannot be ignorance, but wilful miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.
The anecdote was never related

honour on our ancient Monarch. The author
attempts to prove, that the Engliſh nation have
been overbearing from the remoteſt times; and
this he inſtances by giving the anecdote of
Canute in this ſenſeleſs narration—</p>
               <p>' Canute, King of England, imitating his
predeceſſors, who called themſelves Lords and
Sovereigns of the ſea, reſolved to take poſſeſſion
of this title ſolemnly, that, in future times, it

by obliging the ſea itſelf to come and pay him

this language to the ſea, when it rolled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him—"Know, that thou art ſubjected
to me: the earth on which I ſit is mine; and
that, till now, none has ever dared to revolt
from my will. I command thee, then, that
thou remain where thou art, without daring
to approach thy Lord, and ſoil his robes!"
Scarce had he concluded this ſpeech, when a
wave overturned his throne; and, having
wetted him from his head to his feet, taught
him in what manner he was to rely on the
obedience of this element.'</p>

               <head>THE ITALIANS.</head>
               <p>THE character of the Italians, even ſo late
as in the laſt century, preſents a melancholy
contemplation to the Philoſopher. How are
we to account for a whole nation being infected
with ſome of the darkeſt paſſions that ſtain the
human ſoul? Atheiſm and Debauchery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
every rank; and the hand of the Italian
continually graſped the dagger and the drug.
What yet heightens the enormity of theſe
crimes, is the 'immortal hatred'—to make uſe
of a poetical expreſſion—which characterized
this Nation of Aſſaſſins. Naudé, who draws
his remarks from perſonal obſervation, with
one or two anecdotes, will inform the reader
that theſe cenſures are not unjuſt.</p>
               <p>' Italy is crouded with thoſe kinds of men
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:1020400300:367"/>
who penetrate as far into Nature as their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
permit them; and, having done this,
will believe nothing more. To trace God, in
the diſorder in which the world is now, we
muſt poſſeſs modeſty and humility. Italy
abounds with Libertines and Atheiſts; yet the
number of their writers, who have written on
the Immortality of the Soul, is incredible.
But I am apt to think that thoſe very writers
believe no more than the reſt: for I hold this
maxim certain, that <hi>the doubt</hi> in which they
are in is one of the firſt cauſes that obliges
them to write; and add, alſo, that all their
writings are ſo feeble, that no one can
ſtrengthen, by their ſentiments, his faith.
Thus, inſtead of inſtructing, they make a
reader perfectly ſceptical.</p>
               <p>'Italy is a country, at the ſame time, full
of Impoſtures and Superſtitions: ſome do not
believe enough, and others believe every thing.
Every day, without truth, and without reaſon,
miracles take place. I remember that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:1020400300:368"/>
poor man was nearly drowned, and was
drawn out of the water almoſt dead. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
and his recovery was firmly believed to
be, becauſe he happened to have in his chaplet
a medal of Saint Philip of Neri. I did not ſee
any thing miraculous in this, I ſaid; and that
it certainly was not always a miracle when a
man eſcaped from being drowned: nor did I
believe that Saint Philip thought one moment
concerning the fate of this man.</p>
               <p>' It is but three months ſince, that the church
of this new ſaint fell in at Trepani, when more
than a dozen of the congregation, who were
invoking his favours, got wounded and killed.
It was then, rather, that the ſaint ſhould have
ſhewn his miraculous powers, and have faved
thoſe good Chriſtians who were ſupplicating
God and his ſaintſhip. Had this been the caſe,
it would have turned out an excellent Miracle,
and, what few Miracles are accompanied by,
have had a conſiderable number of witneſſes to
verify it.</p>

' The Italians are an agreeable people
enough; but, too frequently, they are found
vindictive and treacherous. Revenge and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
are the great ſins of the Italians and the
Eaſterns; and they poiſon to the very mice in
their houſes.</p>
               <p>' It is a maxim received into the politics of
this country, however it may be inimical to
the laws of Chriſtianity, that it is beſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and to avenge ourſelves before worſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.
As they have great ſenſe, they will never
offend you; but they will never pardon you,
if you offend them; and they will purſue their
revenge, after an interval of fifty years has
elapſed ſince the offence had been firſt given.
They have this Proverb much in eſteem—'<hi>Chi
offende, non perdona mai.</hi>'</p>
               <p>Deſcartes, in one of his Letters, writes thus—'Be not ſo deſirous to live under Italian ſkies;
there is a contagion that poiſons it's breezes;
the heat of the day kindles a fever in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
frame; the evening airs are unwholeſome;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:1020400300:370"/>
and the deep ſhades of the night <hi>conceal</hi> rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries
and aſſaſſinations!'</p>
               <p>The following anecdotes of Italian revenge
are of good authority. An Italian feigned to
be reconciled with one who had offended him.
One evening, when they walked out together
in a retired ſpot, the Italian ſeized him by the
back; and, drawing a dagger, threatened to
ſtab him if he did not abjure, and curſe the
Creator. The other, in vain, entreated that he
might not be obliged to commit what he felt a
horror in doing; but, to ſave his life, at length
he complied. The aſſaſſin, having now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
his wiſh, plunged the poignard in his
boſom; and exultingly exclaimed, that he had
revenged himſelf in the moſt dreadful manner
poſſible; for he had cauſed the body and the ſoul
of his enemy to periſh at a ſingle ſtroke!</p>
               <p>One Giuſeppe Bertoldo, after an abſence
of ten years, hearo that a perſon who had
ſerved him an ill turn, reſided in flouriſhing
circumſtances at India. He embarks directly;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:1020400300:371"/>
he arrives; he follows him cloſely for two
years; and, at length, having found him one
day alone, and unarmed, in a ſolitary ſpot, he
aſſaſſinates him.</p>
               <p>There is a narration, written in Italian, in a
manuſcript in the French King's Library,
tacked to the end of a Volume intitled—'<hi>Le

chain of treachery diſhonourable to the human
character. I had prepared a tranſlation of this
ſingular tranſaction; but, as I now find that
Mr. Andrews has juſt given it in the Adden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da

than thoſe we have noticed. I ſhall
add an inſtance of <hi>poiſoning,</hi> which cannot fail
to intereſt the reader of ſenſibility.</p>
               <p>Francis of Medicis, after the death of his

Venetian, named Bianca Capella, whom he
married. This lady, who paſſionately loved

the Duke her huſband, was the cauſe of his
death; attempting to revenge herſelf <hi>à l'Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi>—as my Author expreſſes it—of a Prince
who was a relation of Francis. She had, with
this deſign, poiſoned ſome olives that were to

met the ſervant, took two, and eat them: very

               <p>MR. Morin has formed a little Hiſtory of

of it's birth. Chronologiſts are ſilent;

Poverty, though of remote antiquity, did
not exiſt from the earlieſt times. In the firſt
Age, diſtinguiſhed by the epithet of the Golden,
it certainly was unknown. In the terreſtrial
Paradiſe it never entered. This Age, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
had but the duration of a flower: when
it finiſhed, Poverty began to appear. The
anceſtors of the human race, if they did not
meet her face to face, knew her in a partial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
She muſt have made a rapid progreſs
at the time of Cain; for Joſephus informs us,
he ſcoured the country with a banditti. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from this obſcure period, it is certain
ſhe was firmly eſtabliſhed in the Patriarchal
age. It is then we hear of Merchants, who
publicly practiſed the commerce of vending
ſlaves, which indicates the utmoſt degree of
Poverty. She is diſtinctly marked by Job:
this holy man proteſts, that he had nothing to
reproach himſelf with reſpecting the Poor, for
he had aſſiſted them in their neceſſities.</p>
               <p>As we advance in the Scriptures, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:1020400300:375"/>
the Legiſlators paid great attentions to
their relief. Moſes, by his wiſe precautions,
endeavoured to ſoften the rigours of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
ſtate. The diviſion of lands, by tribes
and families; the ſeptennial jubilees; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
to beſtow, at the harveſt-time, a certain
portion of all the fruits of the earth for thoſe
families who were in want; and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his moral law, to love one's neighbour
as one's ſelf; were ſo many mounds erected
againſt the inundations of Poverty. It was
thus that the Jews, under their Ariſtocratic
government, had few or no Mendicants.—Their Kings were unjuſt; and, rapaciouſly ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on inheritances which were not their right,
increaſed the numbers of the poor. From the
reign of David, there were oppreſſive gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
who devoured the people as their bread. It
was ſtill worſe under the foreign powers of
Babylon, of Perſia, and the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.
Such were the extortions of their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,
and the avarice of their Governors, that
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:1020400300:376"/>
the number of Mendicants was dreadfully
augmented; and, it was probably for that
reaſon that the opulent families conſecrated
a tenth part of their property for their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
as appears in the time of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.
In the preceding ages, no more was
given—as their Caſuiſts aſſure us—than the
fortieth, or thirtieth part; a cuſtom which this
unfortunate nation to the preſent hour preſerve
and look on it as an indiſpenſible duty; ſo
much ſo, that if there are no poor of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
where they reſide, they ſend it to the moſt
diſtant parts. The Jewiſh merchants always
make this charity a regular charge in their
tranſactions with each other; and, at the cloſe
of the year, render an account to the poor of
their nation.</p>
               <p>By the example of Moſes, the ancient Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators
were taught to pay a ſimilar attention
to their poor. Like him, they publiſhed laws
reſpecting the diviſion of lands; and many
ordinances were made for the benefit of thoſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1020400300:377"/>
whom fires, inundations, wars, or bad harveſts,
had reduced to want. Convinced that <hi>idleneſs</hi>
more inevitably introduced poverty than any
other cauſe, they puniſhed it rigorouſly. The
Egyptians made it criminal; and no vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds
or medicants were ſuffered, under any
pretence whatever. Thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of ſlothfulneſs, and ſtill refuſed to labour
for the public, when labours were offered to
them, were puniſhed with death. It was the
Egyptian taſk-maſters who obſerved that the
Iſraelites were an idle nation, and obliged them
to furniſh bricks for the erection of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
pyramids, which are the works of men
who otherwiſe had remained vagabonds and
mendicants.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſpirit inſpired Greece. Lycurgus
would not have in his republic either <hi>poor</hi> or
<hi>rich:</hi> they lived and laboured in common.
As, in the preſent times, every family has it's
ſtores and cellars; ſo they had public ones, and
diſtributed the proviſions according to the ages
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:1020400300:378"/>
and conſtitutions of the people. If the ſame
regulation was not preciſely obſerved by the
Athenians, the Corinthians, and the other
people of Greece, the ſame maxim exiſted in
full force againſt idleneſs.</p>
               <p>According to the laws of Draco, Solon, &amp;c.
a conviction of wilful poverty was puniſhed
with the loſs of life. Plato, more gentle in
his manners, would have them only baniſhed.
He calls them enemies of the ſtate; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,
as a maxim, that where there are
great numbers of mendicants, fatal revolutions
will happen; for, as theſe people have nothing
to loſe, they ſeize and plan opportunities to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb
the public repoſe.</p>
               <p>The ancient Romans, whoſe univerſal object
was the public proſperity, were not indebted to
Greece on this head. One of the principal
occupations of their Cenſors was to keep a
watch on the vagabonds. Thoſe who were
condemned as incorrigible ſluggards, were ſent
to the mines, or made to labour on the public
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1020400300:379"/>
edifices. The Romans of thoſe times, unlike
the preſent race, did not conſider the <hi>far niento</hi>
as a pleaſing occupation: they were convinced,
that their liberalities were ill-placed in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them on ſuch men. The little republics
of the <hi>Bees</hi> and the <hi>Ants</hi> were often held out
as an example; and the laſt, particularly,
where Virgil ſays, that they have elected over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,
who correct the ſluggards—<q>
                     <l>—Pars agmina cogunt</l>
                     <l>Caſtigant que moras.</l>
                     <bibl>VIRGIL.</bibl>
                  </q>

And, if we may truſt the narratives of our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
the <hi>Beavers</hi> purſue this regulation
more rigorouſly and exact than even theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
ſocieties. But their rigour, although
but animals, is not ſo barbarous as that of the
ancient Germans; who, Tacitus informs us,
plunged the idlers and vagabonds in the
thickeſt mire of their marſhes, and left them
to periſh by a kind of death that reſembled
their inactive diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:1020400300:380"/>
Yet, after all, it was not inhumanity that
prompted the ancients thus ſeverely to chaſtiſe
idleneſs: they were induced to it by a ſtrict
equity; and it would be doing them injuſtice
to ſuppoſe, that it was thus they treated thoſe
<hi>unfortunate poor</hi> whoſe indigence was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by infirmities, by age, or unforeſeen
calamities. They, perhaps, exceeded us in
genuine humanity. Every family conſtantly
aſſiſted it's branches, to ſave them from being
reduced to beggary; which, to them, appeared
worſe than death. The magiſtrates protected
thoſe who were deſtitute of friends, or inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of labour. When Ulyſſes was diſguiſed
as a mendicant, and preſented himſelf to Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,
this Prince, obſerving him to be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt
and healthy, offered to give him employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or otherwiſe to leave him to his ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
When the Roman Emperors, even in
the reigns of Nero and Tiberius, beſtowed their
largeſſes, the diſtributors were ordered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thoſe from receiving a ſhare whoſe bad
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:1020400300:381"/>
conduct kept them in miſery; for that it was
better the lazy ſhould die with hunger than be
fed in idleneſs.</p>
               <p>Whether the police of the ancients was more
exact, or whether they were more attentive to
practiſe the duties of humanity, or that ſlavery
ſerved as an efficacious corrective of idleneſs;
it clearly appears how little was the miſery,
and how few the numbers, of their poor. This
they did, too, without having recourſe to hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals.</p>
               <p>At the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, when
the Apoſtles commanded a community of riches
among their diſciples, the miſeries of the poor
became alleviated in a greater degree. If they
did not abſolutely live together, as we have
ſeen religious orders, yet the rich continually
ſupplied their diſtreſſed brethren: but matters
greatly changed under Conſtantine. This
Prince, with the beſt intentions, publiſhed
edicts in favour of thoſe Chriſtians who had
been condemned, in the preceding reigns, to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:1020400300:382"/>
ſlavery, to the mines, the galleys, or priſons.
The Church felt an inundation of prodigious
crowds of theſe unhappy men, who brought
with them urgent wants and corporeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
The Chriſtian families formed then
but a few: they could not ſatisfy theſe men.
The magiſtrates protected them: they built
ſpacious hoſpitals, under different titles, for
the ſick, the aged, the invalids, the widows,
and orphans. The Emperors, and the moſt
eminent perſonages, were ſeen in theſe hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals,
examining the patients. Sometimes
they aſſiſted the helpleſs, and ſometimes dreſſed
the wounded. This did ſo much honour to the
new religion, that Julian the Apoſtate intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
this cuſtom among the Pagans. But
the beſt things are ſeen continually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>Theſe retreats were found not ſufficient.
Many ſlaves, proud of the liberty they had
juſt recovered, looked on them as priſons;
and, under various pretexts, wandered about
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:1020400300:383"/>
the country. They diſplayed, with art, the
ſcars of their former wounds, and expoſed the
imprinted marks of their chains. They found
thus a lucrative profeſſion in begging, which
had been interdicted by the laws. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
did not finiſh with them: men of an
untoward, turbulent, and licentious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
gladly embraced it. It ſpread ſo wide,
that the ſucceeding Emperors were obliged to
inſtitute new laws; and it was permitted to
individuals to ſeize on theſe mendicants for
their ſlaves and perpetual vaſſals: a powerful
preſervative againſt this diſorder. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in almoſt every part of the world but
ours; and it is thus that nowhere they ſo
abound with beggars. China preſents us with
a noble example. No beggars are ſeen loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their country. All the world are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
even to the blind and the lame. Thoſe
who are incapable of labour, live at the public
expence. What is done <hi>there,</hi> may alſo be
performed <hi>here.</hi> Then, inſtead of that hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:1020400300:384"/>
importunate, idle, licentious poverty—as
pernicious to the police as to morality—we
ſhould ſee the poverty of the earlier ages hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
modeſt, frugal, robuſt, induſtrious, and
laborious. Then, indeed, the fable of Plato
might be realized: Poverty may be embraced
by the god of riches; and, if ſhe did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the vuluptuous offspring of Love, ſhe
would become the fertile mother of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the ingenious mother of the fine
Arts, and of all kinds of Manufactures.</p>

               <p>It avails little to exclaim againſt Slavery; it
is an evil ſo natural to man, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
totally to eradicate it. Man will be a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:1020400300:385"/>
and, if he poſſeſſed an adequate ſtrength,
he would enſlave whatever ſurrounded him.
Dominion is ſo flattering to pride, and to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that it is impoſſible to ſacrifice it's enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Even the Slave himſelf requires to be
attended by another Slave: it is thus with the
Negro of Labat; who, ſince his ſtate permits
of none, aſſumes a deſpotic authority over his
wife and children.</p>
               <p>There are Slaves even with ſavages; and, if
force cannot eſtabliſh ſervitude, they employ
other means to ſupply it. The Chief of the
<hi>Natchès</hi> of Louiſiana diſpoſes at his will of
the property of his ſubjects: they dare not
even refuſe him their head. He is a perfect
deſpotic prince. When the preſumptive heir
is born, the people devote to him all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at the breaſt, to ſerve him during his life.
This petit Chief is a very Seſoſtris; he is treated
in his cabin as the Emperor of China is in his
palace. Indeed, the origin of his power is
great: the <hi>Natchès</hi> adore the Sun, and this
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:1020400300:386"/>
Sovereign has palmed himſelf on them for the
Brother of the Sun!</p>
               <p>Servitude is ſometimes as pleaſing to the
ſlave as it is gratifying to the maſter; and can
any thing more ſtrongly convince us, that the
greater part of men are unworthy of taſting
the ſweets of liberty? It was thus, when the
Monarchs of France were deſirous of deſpoiling
the Barons of the authority they had uſurped,
the bondmen, accuſtomed to ſlavery, were ſlow
in claiming their liberty. To effect this, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
neceſſary to <hi>compel</hi> them by laws; and
Louis Hutin ordered, that thoſe villains, or
bondmen, who would not be enfranchiſed,
ſhould pay heavy fines.</p>
               <p>The origin of Slavery, in ſome countries,
ariſes from ſingular circumſtances. If a Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
met in his way a man, or woman, who
could not ſhew a paſſport from the King, he
would ſeize on the perſon as his right and
property.</p>
               <p>Formerly, in Circaſſia, when the huſband
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:1020400300:387"/>
and wife did not agree, they went to complain
to the governor of the town. If the huſband
was the firſt who arrived, the governor cauſed
the woman to be ſeized on and ſold, and gave
another to the huſband; and, on the contrary,
he ſeized on and ſold the huſband, if the wife
arrived the firſt.</p>
               <p>Liberality, and the deſire of obliging—who
could credit it?—occaſion the depriving others
of their liberty. An Iſlander of Mindanao, who
redeems his ſon from Slavery, makes him his
own ſlave; and children exerciſe the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
and rigour on their parents.</p>
               <p>In Rome, the debtor became the ſlave of his
creditor; and, when it happened that they could
take nothing from him who had loſt every
thing, they took his liberty. It is even believed,
that the law of the Twelve Tables permitted
them to cut into pieces an inſolvent debtor!</p>
               <p>It is ſince the eſtabliſhment of the commerce
and ſale of Negroes, that men have committed
the moſt enormous crimes. The Mulattoes
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:1020400300:388"/>
of Loanda ſeduce the young women wherever
they paſs: they return to them, ſome years
afterwards; and, under the pretext of giving
the children a better education, they carry them
off to ſell them.</p>
               <p>Thus, alſo, the women of Benguela, in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
with their huſbands, allure other men
to their arms. The huſband falls ſuddenly on
them, impriſons the unfortunate gallants, and
ſells them the firſt opportunity; and he is not
puniſhed for theſe violences.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Negroes ſell their children, their
parents, and their neighbours! They lead to
the country-houſe of the merchant their unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
victims, and there deliver them into
the hands of their purchaſer. While they are
loaded with chains, and ſeparated for ever from
their moſt endearing connections, it is in vain
they raiſe loud and melancholy cries: the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
vender ſmiles, and ſays it is only a cunning
trick. Le Maire informs us, that an old Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro
reſolved to ſell his ſon: but the ſon, who
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:1020400300:389"/>
ſuſpected his deſign, haſtened to the factor;
and, having taken him aſide, ſold him his
father!</p>
               <p>The Iſlanders of Biſſagos are paſſionately
fond of ſpirituous liquors; and, on the arrival
of a veſſel, the weakeſt, without diſtinction of
age, friendſhip, or relationſhip, become the
prey of the ſtrongeſt, that they may ſell them
to purchaſe liquors.</p>
               <p>It appears that, in the Eaſt, and particularly
at Batavia, the life of a ſlave entirely depends
on the caprices of his maſter: the ſlighteſt
fault brings on him the moſt afflicting treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They bind him to a gallows; they
flog him unmercifully with ſplitted canes; his
blood flows in a ſtream, and his body is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with wounds: but, fearful that he may
not die in ſufficient tortures, they ſcatter abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
over them ſalt and pepper. So little
care is paid to theſe unfortunate men amongſt
the Maldivians, that they lie entirely at the
mercy of every one. Thoſe who practiſe on
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:1020400300:390"/>
them any ill treatment, receive only half the
puniſhment that the laws exact from any one
who had ill-treated a free perſon. The ſlighteſt
chaſtiſement which is inflicted on them, at
Java, is to carry about their necks a piece of
wood, with a chain, and which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to drag all their lives.</p>
               <p>The ſlaves of the kingdom of Angola, and
many other countries of Africa, never addreſs
their maſters but on their knees. They do
not even allow them the honours of decent
burial; they throw their bodies in the woods,
where they become the food of wild beaſts.</p>
               <p>If thoſe on the Gold Coaſt eſcape, and are
retaken, they loſe an ear for the firſt offence
of this kind: a ſecond offence is puniſhed with
the loſs of the other. At the third, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their maſters either to ſell them to the
Europeans, or to cut off their heads.</p>
               <p>Religious fanaticiſm increaſes the inhumanity
of the pirates of Africa. The Moors and the
Europeans reciprocally deteſt each other; and,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1020400300:391"/>
ſince they redeem their captives, the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
have become unmerciful, that they may
the more powerfully excite their friends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
them with heavy ranſoms. We muſt
not credit every thing Hiſtorians record; but
it is certain that the police does not puniſh the
maſter who kills his ſlaves; that religious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
totally ſtifle the feelings of humanity;
and that the zealous Muſſulman inflicts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
tortures on theſe unfortunate men, that
they may abjure their religion.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards, and the Knights of Malta,
for their repriſals, chain to the galley all the
Mahometans they make priſoners; and, it is
thus that the fate of the Chriſtian ſlaves on the
Northern Coaſt of Africa, is the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of a war which never can termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>When the NEGROES of the Colonies ſolely
depend on a brutal maſter, who can paint the
horrors of their ſituation? Without dwelling
on the cruelties which they ſuffer in Africa,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:1020400300:392"/>
before they are ſold, and during the voyage;
the greater part believe, that, after their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkment
from America, the Europeans intend
to maſſacre them in the moſt terrible manner
imaginable: to burn, calcine, and pulverize
their bones, to be employed as gunpowder;
and they alſo imagine, that the Europeans
manufacture an oil with their fat and marrow.</p>
               <p>If they do not finiſh their taſk, they are
laſhed with rods till they are covered with
blood. Sometimes they pour over their raw
wounds a pound of melted pitch; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they heighten their unſupportable ſmart
by ſcattering over them handfuls of pepper!</p>
               <p>The habit of ſuffering endows them with
an admirable patience. It is thus <hi>Labat</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
himſelf on this head. 'They are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
heard to cry out, or to complain. It is
not owing to inſenſibility, for their fleſh is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
delicate, and their feelings irritable.
It proceeds from an uncommon magnanimity
of ſoul, which ſets at defiance pain, grief,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:1020400300:393"/>
and death itſelf. I have more than once ſeen
ſome broken on the wheel, and others torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the moſt dreadful machines inventive
cruelty could produce, without their giving
vent to one murmur, or ſhedding one tear. I
ſaw a Negro burnt, who was ſo far from being
affected, that he called for a little lighted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
on his way to the place of execution;
and I obſerved him ſmoak with great calmneſs,
at the moment his feet were conſuming in the
midſt of the flames. There were two Negroes
condemned; the one to the gallows, the other
to be whipped by the hand of the executioner.
The Prieſt, in a miſtake, confeſſed him who
was not to have died. They did not perceive
it, till the moment the executioner was going
to throw him off; they made him deſcend; the
other was confeſſed; and, although he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only to be whipped, he mounted the ladder
with as much indifference as the firſt deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it, and as if the choice of either fate
was alike to him.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:1020400300:394"/>
How grievous muſt be the unfortunate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
of thoſe Negroes, when they poſſeſs a
ſoul ſo great, and ſentiments ſo ſublime! At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
examining once ſome ſlaves, obſerved
one of a noble ſlature, who appeared to him
not leſs vigorous than imperious; he glanced
on his companions, whenever they murmured
or wept, looks of reproach and diſdain. He
never turned his eyes on the overſeer; and,
if commanded to riſe, or to ſtretch his
leg, he did not by any means immediately
obey. His exaſperated maſter wearied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with laſhing his naked body with his rod.
He was going to diſpatch him in his fury, had
it not been obſerved to him, that if he ſold him,
he might get an uncommon price for a ſlave of
his appearance. The Negro ſupported this
perſecution with heroic intrepidity; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a rigid ſilence; a tear or two only trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down his cheek; when, as if he bluſhed
for his weakneſs, he turned aſide to hide them.
'I learnt,' Atkins writes, 'that he was a Chief
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:1020400300:395"/>
of ſome villages who had juſt come from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

               <p>In a word, they have reduced them to the

               <head>A NEW RELIGION.</head>
               <p>ALL the world knows how ſucceſsful ſome
impoſtors have been in the eſtabliſhment of
Religions. We Europeans are well perſuaded,
that the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian are derived
from Divine authority. We are perfectly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that Mahomet, Manco Capac, Confucius,
the Lama of Tartary, are impoſtors. Though
a greater number of nations reſpect <hi>their</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
holy ſcriptures than the true Bible, as
voyagers have made new diſcoveries, new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
have been diſcovered. The liſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
impoſtors it is not difficult to augment.
The Jews have ſeen five or ſix fictitious Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiahs—Sabbatei Sevi the moſt remarkable of
them. I am convinced, that not a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1020400300:397"/>
have failed in their eſtabliſhment; and
I will oppoſe to theſe impoſtors a man, who
was more learned and able than any of them.
But circumſtances were not favourable to his
ſyſtem: he had not, like Mahomet, to join with
his Alcoran, a good armoury of ſwords in his
poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>About the middle of the fifteenth century,
ſome time before the Turks had become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Conſtantinople, a great number of
Philoſophers flouriſhed. <hi>Gemiſtus Plethon</hi>
was one diſtinguiſhed by the excellence of his
genius, by the depth of his erudition, and
chiefly by his being a warm Platoniſt. Such
were his eminent abilities, that, in his old age,
thoſe whom his novel ſyſtem had greatly irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
either feared or reſpected him. He had
ſcarcely breathed his laſt moments, when they
began to abuſe Plato and our Plethon. Here
is an account, written by George of Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zond—</p>
               <p>' There has lately aroſe, amongſt us, a ſecond
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:1020400300:398"/>
Mahomet; and this ſecond, if we do not take
care, will exceed in greatneſs the firſt, by the
dreadful conſequences of his wicked doctrine,
as the firſt has exceeded Plato. A diſciple and
rival of this Philoſopher, in philoſophy, in
eloquence, and in ſcience, he had fixed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
in the Peloponneſe. His common name
was <hi>Gemiſtus,</hi> but he aſſumed that of <hi>Plethon.</hi>
Perhaps Gemiſtus, to make us believe more
eaſily that he was deſcended from heaven, and
to engage us to receive more readily his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
and his new law, wiſhed to change his
name, according to the manner of the ancient
patriarchs; of whom it is ſaid, that at the time
the name was changed they were called to the
greateſt things. He has writen with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
art, and with great elegance. He has given
new rules for the conduct of life, and for the
regulation of human affairs; and, at the ſame
time, has vomited forth a great number of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
againſt the Catholic religion. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
he was ſo zealous a Platoniſt, that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1020400300:399"/>
no other ſentiments than thoſe of Plato,
concerning the nature of the Gods, Souls,
Sacrifices, &amp;c. I have heard him, myſelf,
when we were together at Florence, ſay that,
in a few years, all men on the face of the
earth would embrace, with one common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and with one mind, a ſingle and ſimple
religion, at the firſt inſtructions which ſhould
be given by a ſingle preaching. And when I
aſked him, if it would be the religion of Jeſus
Chriſt, or that of Mahomet? he anſwered,
"Neither one nor the other; but a <hi>third,</hi>
which will not greatly differ from <hi>Paganiſm.</hi>"
Theſe words I heard with ſo much indignation,
that ſince that time I have always hated him:
I look upon him as a dangerous viper; and I
cannot think of him without abhorrence.'</p>
               <p>The pious writer of this account is too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
agitated: he might, perhaps, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
a ſmile of pity, or contempt; but the
bigots of religion are not leſs inſane than the
impious themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:1020400300:400"/>
It was when Plethon died, that the malice
of his enemies collected all it's venom. We
cannot but acknowledge, from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that his abilities muſt have been aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
vaſt, to have kept ſuch crowds ſilent:
and, it is not improbable, this ſcheme of
impiety was leſs impious than the majority
of the people imagined. Not a few Catholic
writers lament that his Book was burnt, and
greatly regret the loſs of Plethon's work;
which, they ſay, was not meant to ſubvert the
Chriſtian religion, but only to unfold the ſyſtem
of Plato, and to collect what he and other
Philoſophers had written on Religion and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
At the ſame time, however, we muſt
recollect the expreſs words of Plethon, which
we come from tranſcribing as given us by
George of Trebizond.</p>
               <p>Of his religious ſcheme, the reader may now
judge, by this ſummary account. The general
title of the volume ran thus—'This Book
treats of the Laws, of the beſt Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:1020400300:401"/>
and what all Men muſt obſerve in
their public and private Stations, to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the moſt perfect, the moſt innocent,
and the moſt happy Manner.' The whole was
divided into Three Books. The titles of the
chapters, where Paganiſm was openly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
are reported by Gennadius, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
it to the flames, but who has not
thought proper to enter into the manner of his
arguments, &amp;c. The impiety and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
of this new Legiſlator appeared, above
all, in the articles which concerned Religion.
He acknowledges a plurality of gods: ſome
ſuperior, whom he placed above the heavens;
and the others, inferior, on this ſide the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
The firſt, exiſting from the remoteſt
antiquity; the others younger, and of different
ages. He gave a King to all theſe gods; and
he called him ΖΕΥΣ—or <hi>Jupiter</hi>—as the Pagans
named this power formerly. According to
him, the Stars had a Soul; the Demons were
not malignant Spirits; and the World was
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:1020400300:402"/>
eternal. He eſtabliſhed Polygamy; and was
even inclined to a community of women. All
his work was filled with ſuch follies; and with
not a few impieties, which my pious Author
will not venture to give.</p>
               <p>What the intentions of Plethon were, it
would be raſh and ungenerous in us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
If the work was only an arrangement
of the Heathen notions, it was an innocent
and curious volume. It is allowed, that he was
uncommonly learned and humane, and had
not paſſed his life entirely in the ſolitary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
of his ſtudy.</p>
               <p>I cannot quit this article, without recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two ſimilar works even of the preſent day.
The ideas of the phrenetic <hi>Emanuel Sweden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
are warmly cheriſhed by a ſect, who have
ſo far diſgraced themſelves as to beſtow on their
ſociety the name of this man. It is but very
lately that a work was publiſhed, by a Mr. T.
Taylor, who openly profeſſed Paganiſm! A
book publiſhed by the <hi>Athenian Stuart,</hi> as he

               <p>OUR Edward the Fourth was a gay and
voluptuous Prince; and, what is ſingular, he
probably owed to his enormous debts, and
paſſion for the fair-ſex, his crown. He had
not <hi>one</hi> Jane Shore, but <hi>many.</hi> Hear honeſt
Philip de Comines, his contemporary. He
ſays, that what greatly contributed to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
London as ſoon as he appeared at it's
gates, was the great debts this Prince had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
which made his creditors gladly aſſiſt
him; and the high favour in which he was
held by the <hi>Bourgeoiſes,</hi> into whoſe good graces
he had frequently glided, and who gained him
over their huſbands—who, I ſuppoſe, for the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:1020400300:404"/>
tranquillity of their lives, were glad to depoſe
or raiſe Monarchs.</p>
               <p>Theſe are De Comine's words—'Many
ladies, and rich citizens wives, of whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he had great privacies and familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
gained over to him their huſbands
and relations.'</p>
               <p>This is the deſcription of his voluptuous
life: we muſt recollect, that the writer had been
an eye-witneſs, and was an honeſt man; while
modern Hiſtorians only view objects through
the coloured medium of their imagination, and
do not always merit the latter appellation.</p>
               <p>' He had been, during the laſt twelve years,
more accuſtomed to his eaſe and pleaſures than
any other Prince who lived in his time. He
had nothing in his thoughts but <hi>les dames,</hi> and
of them more than was <hi>reaſonable</hi>; and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-matches,
good eating, and great care of
his perſon. When he went, in their ſeaſons,
to theſe hunting-matches, he always cauſed to
be carried with him great pavilions for <hi>les</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:1020400300:405"/>
                  <hi>dames</hi>; and, at the ſame time, gave ſplendid
entertainments: ſo that it is not ſurprizing
that his perſon was as jolly as any one I ever
ſaw. He was then young, and as handſome
as any man of his age; but he has ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
enormouſly fat.'</p>
               <p>Since I have got old Philip in my hand, the
reader will not, perhaps, be diſpleaſed, if he
attends to a little more of his <hi>naiveté,</hi> which
will appear in the form of a <hi>converſazione</hi> of
the times. He now relates what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Edward and the King of France—</p>
               <p>' When the ceremony of the oath was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
our King, who was deſirous of being
friendly, began to ſay to the King of England,
in a laughing way, that he muſt come to Paris,
and be jovial amongſt our Ladies; and that he
would give him the Cardinal de Bourbon for
his Confeſſor, who would very willingly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
him of any <hi>ſin</hi> which perchance he might
commit. The King of England ſeemed well-pleaſed
at the invitation, and laughed heartily;
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:1020400300:406"/>
for he knew that the ſaid Cardinal was <hi>un fort
bon compagnon.</hi> When the King was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he ſpoke on the road to me; and ſaid,
that he did not like to find the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
ſo much inclined to come to Paris. "He
is," ſaid he, "a very <hi>handſome</hi> King; he likes
the women too much. He may probably find
one at Paris that may make him like to come
too often, or ſtay too long. His predeceſſors
have already been too much at Paris and in
Normandy." And that his company was not
agreeable <hi>this ſide of the ſea</hi>; but that, beyond
the ſea, he wiſhed to be <hi>bon frere et amy.</hi>'</p>
               <p>I feel an inclination to give another conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation-piece;
but, leſt the reader ſhould not ſo
keenly reliſh the honeſt old Narrator as myſelf,
it may be neceſſary to reſtrain my pen.</p>

               <head>A RELIC.</head>
               <p>HENRY the Third was deeply tainted with
the vileſt ſuperſtition. He was a Prince of a
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1020400300:407"/>
daſtardly diſpoſition; and, like all bigots,
endeavoured, by mean ſubterfuge and low
cunning, to circumvent others: incapable of
that noble frankneſs which characterizes an
honeſt man not bigotted to the ſenſeleſs rites
of ſuperſtition. As an inſtance of his bigotry,
take this account of a Relic which is too
curious to abridge—</p>
               <p>' Henry ſummoned all the great men of
the kingdom, A. D. 1247, to come to London
on the feſtival of Saint Edward, to receive an
account of a certain ſacred benefit which
<hi>Heaven</hi> had lately beſtowed on England. The
ſingular ſtrain of this ſummons excited the
moſt eager curioſity, and brought great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
to London at the time appointed. When
they were all aſſembled in Saint Paul's Church,
the King acquainted them, that the Great
Maſter of the Knights Templars had ſent him,
by one of his Knights, a phial of cryſtal, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>ſmall portion of the precious blood of Chriſt,</hi>
which he had ſhed upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:1020400300:408"/>
of the world, <hi>atteſted to be genuine</hi> by
the ſeals of the Patriarch of Jeruſalem, of
ſeveral Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Abbots.
This, he informed them, he deſigned to carry,
the next day, in ſolemn proceſſion, to Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,
attended by them, and by all the
Clergy of London, in their proper habits, with
their banners, crucifixes, and wax-candles;
and exhorted all who were preſent to prepare
themſelves for that ſacred ſolemnity, by ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the night in watching, faſting, and devout
exerciſes. On the morrow, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
was put in order, the King approached
the ſacred phial with <hi>reverence, fear,</hi> and
<hi>trembling</hi>; took it in both his hands; and,
holding it up higher than his face, proceeded
under a canopy, two aſſiſtants ſupporting his
arms. Such was the devotion of Henry on
this occaſion, that, though the road between
Saint Paul's and Weſtminſter was very deep
and miry, he kept his eyes conſtantly <hi>fixed on
the phial,</hi> or on <hi>heaven.</hi> When the proceſſion
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:1020400300:409"/>
approached Weſtminſter, it was met by two
Monks of that Abbey, who conducted it into
the church, where the King depoſited the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Relic; which,' ſays the Hiſtorian, 'made
all England ſhine with glory, dedicating it to
God and Saint Edward.'</p>

               <p>THE reader has frequently heard this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
Son of the Church mentioned; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
his name may have outlived the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

               <p>The Vicar of Bray, in Berkſhire, was a

was a Papiſt again under Queen Mary, and at

               <head>SPANISH ETIQUETTE.</head>
               <p>THE Etiquette—or Rules to be obſerved in
the royal palaces—is neceſſary, obſerves Baron
Bielfield, for keeping order at court. In Spain,
it was carried to ſuch lengths as to make mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
of their Kings. Here is an inſtance; at
which, in ſpite of the fatal conſequences it
produced, one cannot refrain from ſmiling—</p>
               <p>Philip the Third being <hi>gravely ſeated</hi>—as
Spaniards generally are—by a chimney where
the fire-maker of the court had kindled ſo great
a quantity of wood that the Monarch was
nearly ſuffocated with heat, his <hi>grandeur</hi> would
not ſuffer him to riſe from the chair; and the
domeſtics could not <hi>preſume</hi> to enter the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe it was againſt the <hi>Etiquette.</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:1020400300:411"/>
At length, the Marquis de Potat appeared, and
the King ordered him to damp the fires: but
<hi>he</hi> excuſed himſelf; alledging, that he was
forbidden by the <hi>Etiquette</hi> to perform ſuch a
function, for which the Duke D'Uſſeda ought
to be called upon, as it was his buſineſs. The
Duke was gone out; the <hi>fire</hi> burnt fiercer; and
the <hi>King</hi> endured it, rather than derogate from
his <hi>dignity.</hi> But his blood was heated to ſuch
a degree, that an eryſipelas broke out in his
head the next day; which, being ſucceeded
by a violent fever, carried him off in 1621,
and in the twenty-fourth year of his age.</p>
               <p>The palace was once on fire; when a ſoldier,
who knew the King's ſiſter was in her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and muſt inevitably have been conſumed
in a few moments by the flames, at the riſk of
his life, ruſhed in, and brought her Highneſs
ſafe out in his arms: but the Spaniſh <hi>Etiquette</hi>
was here woefully broken into! The loyal
ſoldier was brought to trial; and, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to deny that he had entered her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:1020400300:412"/>
the judges condemned him to die! The
Spaniſh Princeſs, however, condeſcended, in
conſideration of the circumſtance, to <hi>pardon</hi>
the ſoldier, and very benevolently ſaved his
life!</p>
               <p>After this, we may exclaim, with our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

               <p>THE Cardinal Bellarmin, in his Treatiſe <hi>du

with the ſecret tracks and the formidable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
of '<hi>the bottomleſs pit,</hi>' as Swedenburgh
was with the ſtreets and bye-corners of '<hi>the

               <p>He informs us, that there are, beneath the
earth, four different places, or a profound
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:1020400300:413"/>
place divided into four parts. He ſays, that
the deepeſt place is <hi>Hell</hi>; which contains
all the ſouls of the damned, where will be
alſo their bodies after the Reſurrection, and
where likewiſe will be incloſed all the Demons.
The place neareſt Hell is <hi>Purgatory,</hi> where
ſouls are purged; or, rather, where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the anger of God by their ſufferings.
He ſays, that the ſame fires, and the ſame
torments, alike afflict in both theſe places;
and that the only difference between Hell and
Purgatory, conſiſts in their duration. Next to
Purgatory, is the <hi>Limbo</hi> of thoſe <hi>Infants</hi> who
die without having received the Sacrament:
and the fourth place is the <hi>Limbo</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>;

veneration. It has even been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the bigots, that the more ridiculous,
or the more unintelligible, may be the ſubject
for belief, the greater merit it is to receive it
without heſitation. Men have perſuaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that what bears the ſtrongeſt evidence
of falſhood, is the ſacred truth of a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Deity. And it had been well if, on ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
points, they had only <hi>differed</hi> with their
more rational or innocent fellow-creatures.
But theſe bigots have written, in the warm <hi>blood</hi>
of humanity, the articles of their faith. They
have reared an altar to Superſtition, on which
they have not ſacrificed the Scape-Goat, or the

They have agonized the individual

<hi>true</hi> Hiſtory will be acceptable, for it's tender
and amorous incident, to the fair reader.</p>
               <p>The Lord De Coucy, vaſſal to the Count De
Champagne, was one of the moſt accompliſhed
youths of his time. He loved, with an exceſs
of paſſion, the lady of the Lord Du Fayel, who
felt for him reciprocal ardours. It was with
the moſt poignant grief, this lady heard her
lover acquaint her, that he had reſolved to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the King and the Count De Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:1020400300:418"/>
to the wars of the Holy Land; but ſhe
could not oppoſe his wiſhes, becauſe ſhe hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that his abſence might diſſipate the jealouſy
of her huſband. The time of departure hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, theſe two lovers parted with ſorrows
of the moſt lively tenderneſs. The lady, in
quitting her lover, preſented him with ſome
rings, ſome diamonds, and with a ſtring that
ſhe had woven herſelf of his own hair, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with ſilk and buttons of large pearls,
to ſerve him, according to the faſhion of thoſe
days, to tie a magnificent hood which covered
his helmet. This he gratefully accepted, and
inſtantly departed.</p>
               <p>When he arrived in Paleſtine, he received at
the ſiege of Acre, in 1191, in gloriouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
the ramparts, a wound, which was
declared mortal. He employed the few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had to live, in writing to the Lady
Du Fayel; and he made uſe of thoſe fervid
expreſſions which were natural to him in his
afflictive ſituation. He ordered his Squire to
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:1020400300:419"/>
embalm his heart after his death, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
it to his beloved miſtreſs, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
he had received from her hands in quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her.</p>
               <p>The Squire, faithful to the dying commands
of his maſter, returned immediately to France,
to preſent the heart and the preſents to the
Lady of Du Fayel. But, when he approached
the caſtle of this lady, he concealed himſelf in
the neighbouring wood, till he could find ſome
favourable moment to compleat his promiſe.
He had the misfortune to be obſerved by the
huſband of this lady, who recognized him, and
who immediately ſuſpected he came in ſearch
of his wife with ſome meſſage from his maſter.
He threatened to deprive him of his life, if he
did not divulge what had occaſioned him to
come there. The Squire gave him for anſwer,
that his maſter was dead; but Du Fayel not
believing it, drew his ſword to murder him.
This man, frightened at the peril in which he
found himſelf, confeſſed every thing; and put
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1020400300:420"/>
into his hands the heart and letter of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
Du Fayel, prompted by the felleſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
ordered his cook to mince the heart;
and, having mixed it with meat, he cauſed a
ragout to be made, which he knew pleaſed the
taſte of his wife, and had it ſerved to her.
This lady eat greedily of the diſh. After the
repaſt, Du Fayel inquired of his wife, if ſhe
had found the ragout according to her taſte:
ſhe anſwered him, that ſhe had found it excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
'It is for this reaſon,' he replied, 'that
I cauſed it to be ſerved to you, for it is a kind
of meat which you very much liked. You
have, Madam,' the ſavage Du Fayel continued,
'eat the heart of the Lord De Coucy.' But this
ſhe would not believe, till he ſhewed her the
letter of her lover, with the ſtring of his
hair, and the diamonds ſhe had given him.
Then, ſhuddering in the anguiſh of her ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and urged by the darkeſt deſpair, ſhe
told him—'It is true that I loved that heart,
becauſe it merited to be loved: for never could
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:1020400300:421"/>
it find it's ſuperior; and, ſince I have eaten of
ſo noble a meat, and that my ſtomach is the
tomb of ſo precious a heart, I will take care
that nothing of inferior worth ſhall be mixed
with it.' Grief and paſſion choaked her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.
She retired into her chamber: ſhe
cloſed the door for ever; and, refuſing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of conſolation or food, the amiable victim
expired on the fourth day.</p>

Some have given them a very early original,
imagining they are noticed in the 108th Pſalm,
where the Royal Prophet declares, he will caſt
his <hi>Shoe</hi> over Edom. They go ſtill higher;
ſuppoſing them to be uſed in the times of the
Judges, Ruth iv. 7. where it is ſaid, it
was the cuſtom for a man to take off his <hi>Shoe,</hi>
and give it to his neighbour, as a token of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming

tell us, <hi>the word</hi> which in theſe two texts is

thoſe gathered with <hi>Gloves. Athenaeus</hi> ſpeaks
of a celebrated glutton, who always came to
table with <hi>Gloves</hi> on his hands, that he might
be able to handle and eat the meat while hot,
and devour more than the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>Theſe authorities ſhew, that the ancients
were not ſtrangers to <hi>Gloves</hi>; though, perhaps,
their uſe might not be ſo common as amongſt
us. When the ancient ſeverity of manners
declined, the uſe of <hi>Gloves</hi> prevailed among
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:1020400300:424"/>
the Romans; but not without ſome oppoſition
from the Philoſophers. <hi>Muſonius,</hi> a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
who lived at the cloſe of the firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
of Chriſtianity, among other invectives
againſt the corruption of the age, ſays, <hi>It is a
ſhame, that perſons in perfect health ſhould clothe
their hands and feet with ſoft and hairy cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
Their convenience, however, ſoon made
their uſe general. <hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger informs
us, in his account of his uncle's journey to
Veſuvius, that his ſecretary ſat by him, ready
to write down whatever occurred remarkable;
and that he had <hi>Gloves</hi> on his hands, that
the coldneſs of the weather might not impede
his buſineſs.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the ninth century, the
uſe of <hi>Gloves</hi> was become ſo univerſal, that
ever the Church thought a regulation in that
part of dreſs neceſſary. In the reign of <hi>Lewis
le Debonnaire,</hi> the Council of Aix ordered, that
the Monks ſhould only wear <hi>Gloves</hi> made of
ſheep-ſkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:1020400300:425"/>
That Time has made alterations in the form
of this, as in all other apparel, appears from the
old pictures and monuments.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to point out the various
uſes of <hi>Gloves</hi> in the ſeveral ages; for, beſide
their original deſign for a covering of the
hand, they have been employed on ſeveral
great and ſolemn occaſions: as in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Inveſtitures,</hi> in beſtowing lands; or,
in conferring <hi>dignities.</hi> Giving poſſeſſion by
the delivery of a <hi>Glove,</hi> prevailed in ſeveral
parts of Chriſtendom in later ages. In the
year 1002, the Biſhops of Paderborn and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerco
were put into poſſeſſion of their Sees by
receiving a <hi>Glove.</hi> It was thought ſo eſſential
a part of the epiſcopal habit, that ſome Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots
in France, preſuming to wear <hi>Gloves,</hi> the
Council of Poitiers interpoſed in the affair, and
forbid them the uſe of them, on the ſame
footing with the ring and ſandals, as being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Monſieur Favin obſerves, that the cuſtom of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:1020400300:426"/>
bleſſing <hi>Gloves</hi> at the Coronation of the Kings
of France, which ſtill ſubſiſts, is a remain of
the Eaſtern practice of Inveſtiture by <hi>a Glove.</hi>
A remarkable inſtance of this ceremony is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the German Hiſtory. The unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Conradin</hi> was deprived of his crown and
his life by the uſurper <hi>Mainfroy.</hi> When, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſcended the ſcaffold, the injured Prince
lamented his hard fate, he aſſerted his right to
the Crown; and, as a token of Inveſtiture,
threw his <hi>Glove</hi> among the crowd; begging it
might be conveyed to ſome of his relations,
who ſhould revenge his death. It was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up by a Knight, who brought it to Peter,
King of Arragon, who was afterwards crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at Palermo.</p>
               <p>As the delivery of <hi>Gloves</hi> was once a part
of the ceremony uſed in giving poſſeſſion; ſo
the depriving a perſon of them, was a mark of
diveſting him of his office, and of degrading
him. Andrew Herkley, Earl of Carliſle, was,
in the reign of Edward the Second, impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:1020400300:427"/>
of holding a correſpondence with the Scots,
and condemned to die as a traitor. Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
relating other circumſtances of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation,
ſays—'His ſpurs were cut off
with a hatchet; and his <hi>Gloves</hi> and ſhoes
were taken off, &amp;c.'</p>
               <p>Another uſe of <hi>Gloves</hi> was in a duel: on
which occaſion, he who threw one down, was
thereby underſtood to give defiance; and he
who took it up, to accept the challenge.</p>
               <p>The uſe of ſingle combat, at firſt deſigned
only for a trial of innocence, like the ordeal
fire and water, was, in ſucceeding ages, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
for deciding right and property. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
by the <hi>Glove</hi> was continued down to
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as appears by
an account given by Spelman, of a duel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be fought in Tothill Fields, in the
year 1571. The diſpute was concerning ſome
lands in the county of Kent. The Plaintiffs
appeared in Court, and demanded a ſingle
combat. One of them threw down his <hi>Glove.</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:1020400300:428"/>
which the other immediately took up, carried
off on the point of his ſword, and the day of
fighting was appointed; but the matter was
adjuſted in an amicable manner by the Queen's
judicious interference.</p>
               <p>Though ſuch combats are now no longer in
uſe, we have one ceremony ſtill remaining
among us, in which the challenge is given by
a <hi>Glove</hi>; viz. at the Coronation of the Kings
of England: upon which occaſion, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
champion, compleatly armed, and well
mounted, enters Weſtminſter Hall, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
that, if any man ſhall deny the Prince's
title to the crown, he is ready to maintain and
defend it by ſingle combat. After which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
he throws down his <hi>Glove,</hi> or gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
as a token of defiance.</p>
               <p>This cuſtom of challenging by the <hi>Glove</hi> is
ſtill in uſe in ſome parts of the world. It is
common in Germany, on receiving an affront,
to ſend a <hi>Glove</hi> to the offending party, as a
challenge to a duel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:1020400300:429"/>
The laſt uſe of <hi>Gloves</hi> to be mentioned here
was for carrying the <hi>Hawk,</hi> which is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
In former times, Princes and other
great men took ſo much pleaſure in carrying
the Hawk on their hand, that ſome of them
have choſen to be repreſented in this attitude.
There is a monument of Philip the Firſt
of France ſtill remaining; on which he is
repreſented at length, on his tomb, holding a
<hi>Glove</hi> in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chambers ſays that, formerly, judges
were forbid to wear <hi>Gloves</hi> on the bench. No
reaſon is aſſigned for this prohibition. Our
judges lie under no ſuch reſtraint; for both
they and the reſt of the court make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of receiving <hi>Gloves</hi> from the ſheriffs,
whenever the ſeſſion or aſſize concludes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any one receiving ſentence of death, which
is called a <hi>Maiden Aſſize.</hi> This cuſtom is of
great antiquity.</p>
               <p>Our curious Antiquarian has alſo preſerved
a very ſingular anecdote concerning <hi>Gloves.</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:1020400300:430"/>
Chambers informs us, that it is not ſafe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to enter the ſtables of Princes without
pulling off the <hi>Gloves.</hi> He does not, indeed,
tell us in what the danger conſiſts. A friend
from Germany explains the matter. He ſays,
it is an ancient eſtabliſhed cuſtom in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that whoever enters the ſtables of a Prince,
or great man, with his <hi>Gloves</hi> on his hands,
is obliged to forfeit them, or redeem them by
a fee to the ſervants. The ſame cuſtom is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in ſome places at the death of the ſtag;
in which caſe, the <hi>Gloves,</hi> if not taken off, are
redeemed by money given to the huntſmen
and keepers. This is practiſed in France; and
the late King never failed of pulling off one of
his <hi>Gloves</hi> on that occaſion. The reaſon of this
ceremony is not known.</p>
               <p>We meet with the term <hi>Glove-money</hi> in our
old records; by which is meant, money given
to ſervants to buy <hi>Gloves.</hi> This, no doubt,
gave riſe to the ſaying of <hi>giving a pair of</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:1020400300:431"/>
                  <hi>Gloves,</hi> to ſignify making a preſent for ſome
favour or ſervice.</p>
               <p>To the honour of the <hi>Glove,</hi> it has more
than once been admitted as a term of the tenure
or holding lands. One Bortran, who came in
with William the Conqueror, held the Manor
of Farnham Royal by the ſervice of providing
a <hi>Glove</hi> for the King's right-hand on the day
of his coronation, and ſupporting the ſame
hand that day while the King held the royal
ſceptre. In the year 1177, Simon de Mertin
gave a grant of his lands in conſideration of
fifteen ſhillings, one pair of <hi>white Gloves</hi> at
Eaſter, and one pound of cummin.</p>

               <p>THE preſent is an article that, perhaps,
may be thought by many readers apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal.</p>
               <p>When Muretus was at Rome, (ſays Scaliger)—by was of Parentheſis, I muſt obſerve, the
relator and the auditor were the two firſt ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in Europe—there came, one day, to the
palace of the French ambaſſador, a Florentine
of a very ill-favoured countenance, and whoſe
eyes were continually declined on the ground.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:1020400300:433"/>
It was ſaid, that he poſſeſſed, in a wonderful
degree, an Artificial Memory. To give a proof
of his powers, he begged the company, who
were numerous, to ſeat themſelves regularly,
that he might not be diſturbed; and that they
would order to be written down to the number
of <hi>fifty thouſand words:</hi> aſſuring them, that if
they pronounced them diſtinctly, and if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they were read ſlowly, he would repeat
every word without heſitation. This was done.
They would only have troubled him with a
few: but he inſiſted that they ſhould proceed.
The Secretary of the Ambaſſador was employed
full <hi>two hours</hi> in writing the moſt ſingular
words the company could ſelect; and, among
them, was a Cardinal Peleve, who gave him
Polyſyllables in the beſt or longeſt manner of
our late Lexicographer. The Florentine, to the
aſtoniſhment of the audience, recited them
without the ſmalleſt omiſſion; and this he did,
beginning ſometimes at the end, and ſometimes
in the middle. He ſaid, that this Artificial
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:1020400300:434"/>
Memory had cauſed him totally to loſe his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jedediah Buxton's</hi> ſingular memory appears
to have been of a different caſt: he could only
<hi>count</hi> words, &amp;c. for when he went to the
play, he is ſaid to have enumerated the <hi>words</hi>
of Garrick, and the <hi>ſteps</hi> of the dancers; but
he had not, like this man, any one who could
be capable of contradicting him.</p>

Louis the Seventh of France cropped his hair,

She revenged herſelf, by becoming
ſomething more than a coquette. The King
obtained a divorce. She then married the

wars which for three hundred years ravaged
France, and which coſt the French nation three
millions of men. All which, probably, had
never taken place, if Louis the Seventh had
not been ſo raſh as to crop his hair and ſhave
his beard, by which he became ſo diſguſtful in

There was a work of this kind which Menage
has noticed, and which muſt have appeared a
little miracle. In the year 1675, the Duke of
Maine received a gilt cabinet, about the ſize
of a moderate table. On the door was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed—<hi>The Chamber of Wit.</hi> The inſide
diſplayed an alcove and a long gallery. In an
arm-chair was ſeated the figure of the Duke
himſelf, compoſed of wax, the reſemblance the
moſt perfect imaginable. On one ſide ſtood
the Duke de la Rochefoucault, to whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
a paper of verſes for his examination.
Mr. De Marcillac, and Boſſuet, Biſhop of
Meaux, were ſtanding near the arm-chair. In
the alcove, Madame de Thianges, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
de la Fayette, ſat retired, reading a book.
Boileau, the Satiriſt, ſtood at the door of the
gallery, hindering ſeven or eight bad Poets
from entering. Near Boileau, ſtood Racine,
who ſeemed to beckon to La Fontaine to come
forwards. All theſe figures were formed of
wax; and this imitation muſt have been at
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:1020400300:438"/>

Charpentier, who died in the year 1702,
'lead ſober lives, when compared with their

from the world to make eight repaſts
<hi>per diem!</hi> The order of the Chartreux was of
a different complexion. It was, in it's orginal
inſtitution, more auſtere than that of La

food, it was written, that with <hi>barley bread,</hi>

MIRRORS.</head>
               <p>IN the Summer, after ſome days of fine wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
during the heat of the day, if a ſtorm
happens, accompanied with a few light Showers
of rain; and if the Sun appears immediately
after with all it's uſual ardour, it burns the
foliage, and the flowers on which the rain had
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:1020400300:443"/>
fallen, and deſtroys the hopes of the orchard.
The burning heat, which the ardour of the Sun
produces at that time on the leaves and flowers,
is equal to the intenſe heat of <hi>burning Iron.</hi>
Naturaliſts have ſought for the cauſe of this
ſtrange effect, but they have ſaid nothing
which ſatisfies a reaſonable mind. This is,
however, the fact. In the ſerene days of the
Summer, it is viſible that there gathers on the
foliage and the flowers as, indeed, on every
other part, a little duſt, ſometimes more and
ſometimes leſs, ſcattered by the wind. When
the rain falls on this duſt, the drops mix to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and take an oval or round form, as we
may frequently obſerve in our houſes, on the
duſty floor or cieling, when they ſcatter water
before they ſweep them. It is thus theſe globes
of water, mingled on the foliage, form ſo
many of thoſe convex glaſſes which we call
Burning, Mirrors, and which produce the ſame
effect. Should the rain be heavy and laſt long,
the Sun would not then produce this burning
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:1020400300:444"/>
heat, becauſe the force, and the duration of the
rain, will have deſtroyed the duſt which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe drops of water; and theſe drops, loſing
their globular form, in which alone conſiſted
their cauſtic power, will be diſperſed without
any extraordinary effect. For this obſervation,
which, to the Naturaliſt muſt appear curious
and novel, he is indebted to the ingenious

               <head>BLEEDING AND EVACUATION, TWO REME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIES
FOR LOVE.</head>
               <p>HUET has a very ſingular obſervation on
Love, which he exemplifies by an Anecdote
as ſingular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love,</hi> he ſays, is not merely a paſſion of
the ſoul, but it is alſo a diſeaſe of the body,
like <hi>the Fever.</hi> It is frequently in the blood,
and in the mind, which are terribly agitated;
and, to be cured, it may be treated as <hi>metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically</hi>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:1020400300:445"/>
as any other diſorder. Great perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and copious Bleedings, that carry away
with the humour the inflammable ſpirits, would
purge the blood, calm the emotions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
every part in it's natural ſtate.</p>
               <p>The great Condé, having felt a violent paſſion
for Mademoiſelle de Vigean, was conſtrained to
join the army. While his abſence laſted, his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was continually nouriſhed by the tendereſt
recollections of Love, and by an intercourſe of
a continued correſpondence, till the concluſion
of the campaign, when a dangerous ſickneſs
brought him to the moſt imminent danger.
To the violence of his illneſs, violent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were applied; and every thing that was
moſt efficacious in phyſic was given to the
Prince. He regained his <hi>health,</hi> but he had
loſt his <hi>Love:</hi> the great Evacuations had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away his paſſion; and when he thought
himſelf a Lover, he found he had ceaſed to
Love.</p>
               <p>On this Anecdote it is to be obſerved, that
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:1020400300:446"/>
the fact is well authenticated; and, however the
reader may feel himſelf inclined to turn Wit on
this occaſion, it's veracity cannot in the leaſt be
injured. But it muſt be confeſſed, that <hi>Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi>
may not always have on a deſpairing
lover the ſame happy effect. 'When we would
explain the mechaniſm of the human paſſions,'
obſerves an ingenious writer, 'the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
muſt be multiplied.' This fact, then,
does not tend to ſhew that the ſame remedies
will cure every lover, but that they did cure
the Prince de Condé.</p>
               <p>There is, however, another ſpecies of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation,
not leſs efficacious, for a deſpairing
ſwain, which will probably amuſe the reader.</p>
               <p>A German gentleman burned with an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
flame for a German Princeſs. She was
not inſenſible to a reciprocal paſſion; and to
have him about her perſon, without giving
ſcandal, ſhe created him her General. They
lived ſome time much pleaſed with each other;
but the Princeſs became ſickle, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:1020400300:447"/>
grew jealous. He made very ſharp remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances;
and the Princeſs, who wiſhed to be
free, gave him his <hi>congé,</hi> and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to quit her. But his paſſion at every
hour increaſed: he found he could not live out
of her preſence; and he ventured to enter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly
into her cabinet. There he threw
himſelf at her feet, and entreated her forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The Princeſs frowned, and condeſcended
to give no other anſwer than a command to
withdraw from her Royal Highneſs's preſence.
The deſpairing lover exclaimed, that he was
ready to obey her in every thing but that; that
he was reſolved, in this, to diſobey her; and
that he preferred to die by her hand. In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, to give force to his eloquence, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
his naked ſword to the German Princeſs;
who, perhaps, being little acquainted with the
flowers of rhetoric, moſt cruelly took him at
his word, and run him through the body.
Fortunately, the wound did not prove mortal:
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:1020400300:448"/>
he was healed of his wound at the end of three
months; and likewiſe of his paſſion, which had
flowed away with the effuſion of blood.</p>

               <head>INFECTIOUS DISEASES.</head>
               <p>THE preſent article, from the learned Biſhop
of Avranches, if not a valuable, forms at leaſt
an ingenious ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>Neither Naturaliſts or Phyſicians have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
us, what is the cauſe which renders
contagious ſo many diſeaſes, while others are
not in the leaſt infectious. The gout, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
the epilepſy, the apoplexy, are not caught
by frequenting the company of the diſeaſed;
but the plague, the dyſentery, the itch, the
bloody-flux, occaſion frequently terrible ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
by their infection. This is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the fact. It may be ſaid, in general, that
all contagious diſeaſes produce <hi>worms,</hi> which
are contained in ulcers, puſtules, or pimples,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:1020400300:449"/>
either internal or external, ſome leſs and ſome
more, and of different kinds. We ſhall not
here examine the cauſe of the productions of
theſe <hi>worms</hi>; but their effect is common and
unvaried, and ſometimes viſible. It is alſo
well known that theſe worms, by undergoing
a revolution, which in them is natural, change
into the fly ſtate, and become <hi>gnats</hi>; this is
done in a ſhort time, and in infinite numbers.
As ſoon as theſe flies, imperceptible by their
diminutive ſize, can lift themſelves by their
wings, they take their flight. They are there
ſcattered abroad; and, entering the bodies of
men by reſpiration, they infuſe that poiſon by
which they are engendered, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
that corruption from whence they have
ſprung.</p>
               <p>It is thus great fires have been found very
ſerviceable in public contagions: kindled in
divers places, they have, as many imagine,
purified the air. The air is, indeed, purified,
but not in the manner generally ſuppoſed,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:1020400300:450"/>
by rarifying and changing it's compoſition,
but in burning and conſuming theſe flying
<hi>gnats</hi> with which the air is filled; and which,
attracted by the light of the flames, mix with
them, and are deſtroyed in the ſame manner
as moths are by a candle. An oppoſite cauſe
produces alſo the ſame effect; I mean, a ſharp
froſt, that kills and deſtroys theſe terrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,
if not entirely, at leaſt, the greater
part: for it has been known, that ſo great have
been their numbers, that many have eſcaped
the rigours of the froſt, and have continued the
infection; as it happened ſome centuries back,
in the dreadful Plague, which deſolated Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
and the neighbouring countries.</p>

Charles the Fifth, and Louis the Thirteenth,

The proof is, that very frequently bees
are found incloſed in morſels of Amber-gris.
This opinion is ingenious: it is given by the
Abbé Longuerue; but the opinions of what
Amber-gris is compoſed are ſo various, that
the fact is, we are ignorant of it.</p>

               <head>PIOUS FRAUDS.</head>
               <p>THE Abbey of Signi, in Champagne, was
uncommonly rich and extenſive: but at this
we muſt not be aſtoniſhed. Saint Bernard had
promiſed thoſe who aſſiſted to found it, as
much "<hi>Spatium,</hi>" or place in Heaven, as
they gave <hi>land</hi> to his Order of Citeaux. The
good people of thoſe days had more faith in
Saints than their graceleſs poſterity; and, had
the Magiſtrates not reſtrained their pious zeal,
this Abbey would have occupied a whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>

                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:1020400300:455"/>
So alſo, when Pope Urban had to combat
with Clement the Seventh, he was obliged to
have recourſe to the ſcheme of Saint Bernard.
This is not wonderful: but it is wonderful,
that, as ſoon as he publiſhed a Bull, promiſing
a plenary remiſſion of their <hi>Sins,</hi> and a place
in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> to all who fought in his cauſe,
or contributed money to ſupport it, our own
nation flew up in arms; and, as an old Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
obſerves—'As ſoon as theſe Bulls were
publiſhed in England, the whole people were
tranſported with joy, and thought that the
opportunity of obtaining ſuch ineſtimable

               <head>CHINESE PHYSICIANS.</head>
               <p>THE Phyſicians of China, by feeling the

Without their patient's ſpeaking, they reveal
infallibly what part is affected. They are at
once Doctors and Apothecaries, compoſing the
remedies they preſcribe. They are paid when
they have compleated a cure; but they receive
nothing when their remedies do not take effect.
Our Phyſicians, it muſt be confeſſed, are by no
means ſo ſkilful as the Chineſe: but, in one
thing, they have the advantage over them;
which is, in taking their fees before they have
performed the cure. And it is thus that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
with little or no learning, ride in their
chariots in London; while, in Pekin, they are
very learned, and walk on foot.</p>

               <head>FEMALE BEAUTY, AND ORNAMENTS.</head>
               <p>THE Ladies in Japan gild their teeth; and
thoſe of the Indies paint them red. The blackeſt
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:1020400300:457"/>
teeth are eſteemed the moſt beautiful in Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zurat,
and in ſome parts of America. In
Greenland, the women colour their faces with
blue and yellow. However freſh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of a Muſcovite may be, ſhe would
think herſelf very ugly if ſhe was not plaiſtered
over with paint. The Chineſe muſt have
their feet as diminutive as thoſe of the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goats;
and, to render them thus, their youth
is paſſed in tortures. In Ancient Perſia, and
aquiline noſe was often thought worthy of the
crown; and, if there was any competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Princes, the people generally went
by this criterion of majeſty. In ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
the mothers break the noſes of their
children; and, in others, preſs the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two boards, that it may become ſquare.
The modern Perſians have a ſtrong averſion
to red hair: the Turks, on the contrary, are
warm admirers of theſe diſguſting locks. The
Indian Beauty is thickly ſmeared with bear's
fat; and the female Hottentot receives from
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:1020400300:458"/>
the hand of her lover, not ſilks, or wreaths of
flowers, but warm guts and reeking tripe, to
dreſs herſelf with enviable ornaments.</p>
               <p>At China, ſmall eyes are liked; and the
girls are continually plucking their eye-brows,
that they may be ſmall and long. The Turkiſh
women dip a gold bruſh in the tincture of a
black drug, which they paſs over their eye-brows.
It is too viſible by day, but looks
ſhining by night. They tinge their nails with
a roſe-colour.</p>
               <p>An ornament for the noſe appears to us
perfectly unneceſſary. The Peruvians, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
think otherwiſe; and they hand on it a
weighty ring, the thickneſs of which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
by the rank of their huſbands. The
cuſtom of boring it, as our Ladies do their ears,
is very common in ſeveral nations. Through
the perforation are hung various materials;
ſuch as green cryſtal, gold, ſtones, a ſingle and
ſometimes a great number of gold rings. This
is rather troubleſome to them in blowing their
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:1020400300:459"/>
noſes; and the fact is, ſome have informed us,
that the Indian Ladies never perform this very
uſeful operation.</p>
               <p>The female head-dreſs is carried, in ſome
countries, to ſingular extravagance. The
Chineſe Fair carries on her head the figure of
a certain bird. This bird is compoſed of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or of gold, according to the quality of the
perſon: the wings, ſpread out, fall over the
front of the head-dreſs, and conceal the temples.
The tail, long and open, forms a beautiful tuft
of feathers. The beak covers the top of the
noſe; the neck is faſtened to the body of the
artificial animal by a ſpring, that it may the
more freely play, and tremble at the ſlighteſt
motion.</p>
               <p>The extravagance of the Myantſes is far more
ridiculous than the above. They carry on their
heads a ſlight board, rather longer than a foot,
and about ſix inches broad: with this they
cover their hair, and ſeal it with wax. They
cannot lie down, nor lean, without keeping the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:1020400300:460"/>
neck very ſtraight; and, the country being very
woody, it is not uncommon to find them with
their head-dreſs entangled in the trees. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they comb their hair, they paſs an hour
by the fire in melting the wax; but this comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is only performed once or twice a year.</p>
               <p>To this curious account, extracted from Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halde,
we muſt join that of the inhabitants of
the Land of Natal. They wear caps, or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
from ſix to ten inches high, compoſed of
the fat of oxen. They then gradually anoint the
head with a purer greaſe; which, mixing with
the hair, faſtens theſe <hi>bonnets</hi> for their lives!</p>

An officer, having ſpoken ſomewhat
too free of the Miniſter Louvois, was—as once
was the cuſtom—immediately conſigned to the
Baſtile. He begged the Governor to permit
him the uſe of his lute, to ſoften, by the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

great numbers of mice; and, deſcending from
their woven habitations, crouds of ſpiders, who
formed a circle about him, while he continued
breathing his ſoul-ſubduing inſtrument. His

               <p>THE Locuſts, ſo frequently mentioned in
the Scriptures, and in many ancient Authors,
are a ſpecies of Graſhoppers that have nothing
in them diſguſtful. The Parthians, the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,
and the Arabs, found them delicious
food. After cauſing them to fall from the
trees by means of ſmoke, aſcending from fires
kindled at their feet, they ſalted, dried them in
the ſun, and preſerved them for food through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the year. Saint John the Baptiſt ate them
with wild honey, according to the cuſtom of
the poor of thoſe times. They appear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in Aſia, and in Africa, in ſuch prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
numbers, that they darken the air, and
conſume in an inſtant the fruits and herbage of
a whole country; the heaps of thoſe which die
infect the air and occaſion a contagion. It is
probable, that theſe Phenomena are the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi>

of the ancients, which even came to devour
the meats on the table of the King of Bythinia;
and if we add, that Calais and Zethus, the
Children of Boreas, chaſed them from this
country, and purſued them to the Iſles of Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phades,
which are in the Ionian Sea, where
they cauſed them to periſh, all this fiction may
be underſtood thus—that the Northern winds
had blown them into this Sea: and it is true,
that nothing ſo certainly delivers a country
which is infected with theſe inſects, as a ſtrong

               <head>ANTI-MOINE, OR ANTIMONY; COFFEE; AND
JESUIT'S BARK.</head>
               <p>THE origin of <hi>Antimony</hi> is a remarkable
circumſtance. Baſil Valentin, Superior of a
College of Religioniſts, having obſerved that
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:1020400300:469"/>
this mineral fattened the Pigs, imagined that
it would produce the ſame effect on the Holy
Brotherhood. But the caſe was ſeriouſly
different: the unfortunate Fathers, who gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
made uſe of it, died in a very ſhort time.
This is the origin of it's name, which I have
written according to the pure French word. In
ſpite of this unfortunate beginning, Paracelſus
reſolved to bring this mineral into practice;
he thought he could make it uſeful, by mixing
it with other preparations, but he did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
according to his hopes. The Faculty, at
Paris, were on this occaſion divided into two
parties: the one maintained, that <hi>Antimony</hi>
was a <hi>poiſon</hi>; the other affirmed, that it was an
excellent <hi>remedy.</hi> The diſpute became more
general, and the Parliament and the Sorbonne
interfered in the matter: but ſome time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the world began to judge rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this excellent mineral; and it's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
effects have occaſioned the Faculty to
place it among their beſt remedies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:1020400300:470"/>
The uſe of COFFEE is ſaid to have a ſimilar
origin; that, however, was never attended
with ſuch dreadful effects. A Prior of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
in the part of Arabia where this berry
grows, having remarked, that the Goats who
eat of it became extremely briſk and alert, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to try the experiment on his Monks, of
whom he ſo continually complained for their
lethargic propenſities. The experiment turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out ſucceſsful; and, it is ſaid, it was owing
to this circumſtance, that the uſe of this Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian
berry came to be ſo univerſal.</p>
               <p>A caſual circumſtance diſcovered that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
febrifuge, the JESUIT'S BARK. An
Indian, in a delirious fever, having been left
by his companions by the ſide of a river, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
to quench his burning thirſt, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
drank copious draughts of the water,
which, having long imbibed the virtues of the
bark, which abundantly floated on the ſtream,
it quickly diſperſed the fever of the Indian.
He returned to his friends; and, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:1020400300:471"/>
the nature of his remedy, the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
crouded about the margin of the holy
ſtream, as they imagined it to be, till they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
exhauſted all it's virtues. The Sages of
the tribe, however, found at length in what
conſiſted the efficacy of the ſtream. The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans
diſcovered it, in the year 1640, to the
lady of the Vice-roy of Peru, who recovered
by it's uſe from a dangerous fever. In 1649,
the reputation of this remedy was ſpread about
Spain, Italy, and Rome, by the Cardinal de
Lugo and other Jeſuits. And thus, like the
Antimony, it's name is ſignificant of it's
origin.</p>

               <p>I RECOLLECT a pretty Story, which, in

to Solomon.</p>
               <p>The power of this Monarch had ſpread his
wiſdom to the remoteſt parts of the known
world. A private Scholar in general, paſſes
his life in obſcurity; and Poſterity—a ſolitary
conſolation—ſpreads his name to the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
regions. But when a King is a Student,
the caſe is reverſed. Queen Sheba, attracted
by the ſplendour of his reputation, or, more
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:1020400300:473"/>
probably, urged by the inſatiable curioſity of
the female, viſited this poetical King at his
own court, with the ſole intention of <hi>aſking
him queſtions.</hi> The Rabbin cannot inform me,
if her examination of the Monarch was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made in the chamber of audience; there
is reaſon to ſuſpect that they frequently retired,
for the ſolution of many a hard problem, to the
philoſophic ſolitude of a private cabinet. But
I do not intend by any means to make this
work (as my Lord Lyttleton anſwered to a
curious female concerning his Hiſtory) 'a

               <p>It is ſufficient, that the incident I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
paſſed as Solomon ſat ſurrounded by his
court. At the foot of the throne ſtood the
inquiſitive Sheba; in each hand, ſhe held a
wreath of flowers; the one, compoſed of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
the other, of artificial flowers. Art, in
the labour of the mimic wreath, had exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
emulated the lively hues, and the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
beauties of Nature; ſo that, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:1020400300:474"/>
it was held by the Queen for the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the King, it was deemed impoſſible
for him to decide—as her queſtion imported—which wreath was the natural, and which the
artificial. The ſagacious Solomon ſeemed
poſed; yet, to be vanquiſhed, though in a trifle
by a trifling woman, irritated his pride. The
ſon of David—he who had written treatiſes
on the vegetable productions 'from the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
to the hyſſop,' to acknowledge himſelf
outwitted by a woman, with ſhreds of papers
and glazed paintings! The honour of the
Monarch's reputation for divine ſagacity
ſeemed diminiſhed; and the whole Jewiſh
court looked ſolemn and melancholy. At length,
an expedient preſented itſelf to the King; and,
it muſt be confeſſed, worthy of the Natural
Philoſopher. Obſerving a cluſter of Bees
hovering about a window, he commanded that
it ſhould be opened: it was opened; the
Bees ruſhed into Court, and alighted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
on one of the wreaths, while not a

ſingle one fixed on the other. The deciſion
was not then difficult; the learned Rabbins
ſhook their beards in rapture, and the baffled
Sheba had one more reaſon to be aſtoniſhed at
the wiſdom of Solomon.</p>
               <p>This would make a pretty poetical Tale. It

               <p>IT was anciently the cuſtom in Rome, when a

this manner of recitation, which indeed muſt

a bell rung; which was uſual when

deſerted by all his auditors, except one perſon;

The Poet, imagining him to be a man who
poſſeſſed a correct taſte, and for this reaſon
remained there to hear the laſt verſe of his

'to your judicious manner of treating me.

               <p>A certain widow, who felt a very ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
towards the holy bond of matrimony,
thought it moſt decent to take the advice of
the Curate of her pariſh, who paſſed for what
is called <hi>a very good-natured ſoul,</hi> becauſe he
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:1020400300:478"/>
was diſpoſed to let every one act as they
thought proper. 'I am,' ſaid ſhe, 'a poor
unhappy woman, who has loſt the beſt huſband
in the world. My apprentice knows all the
ways of his old maſter. I have often thought
I ſhould do well to marry this young man;
but I wiſh to take your advice.' The Curate
immediately anſwered, that ſhe had then better
take him. 'Ah! but I have my fears,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
the widow: 'when a ſervant becomes
a maſter, it is dangerous.' The Curate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of this ſentiment, and adviſed her not
to marry him. 'But what ſhall I do?' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
the widow: 'I cannot proceed in the
buſineſs my late huſband left, unleſs I find
another.'—'True,' the Curate replied; 'you
will then do well to marry him.'—'Very well,'
ſhe anſwered: 'but, if he happens to turn out
bad, he may ruin me!'—'Very juſt,' replied
the Curate; 'you muſt not marry him then.'
It was in vain: the good-natured Eccleſiaſtic,
to get rid of her importunities, always agreed
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:1020400300:479"/>
with her ſentiments. He obſerved her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
for the apprentice; and, at length, he
found this expedient to terminate her objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
'Go, Madam, and take advice of the
Bells of the Steeple: when they ring, they
will tell you what you ſhould do.' When the
bells rung, the widow attentively liſtened; and,
according to her wiſhes, ſhe heard diſtinctly,
'<hi>Prens ton valet, prens ton valet!</hi>' Upon
theſe ſtrong arguments, in favour of the young
man, ſhe married him. Scarce had the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon
cloſed, when ſhe received very cruel
treatment from her late apprentice; and ſhe
who was miſtreſs, now became a ſervant. She
went to complain to the good-natured Curate

He told her, that ſhe had miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

               <p>THE preſent anecdote, to it's merit as an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
deception, may add that of being a fact.</p>
               <p>When Mademoiſelle De Gournay arrived at
Paris, ſhe deſired to ſee the Marquis of Racan,
an eminent wit and poet. Two of Racan's
friends knew the time they had appointed for
his waiting on her; and they reſolved to be
revenged on Racan for many a ridiculous ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to which he had expoſed them. One of
theſe gentlemen, about two hours before the
time appointed, waited on Mademoiſelle De
Gournay, and announced himſelf as Racan.
He endeavoured to talk with the lady about
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:1020400300:481"/>
her own works, which he had purpoſely turned
over the night before; and, though he did not
perfectly ſatisfy Mademoiſelle De Gournay in
point of his abilities, beſides committing ſome
groſs blunders, ſhe could not, however, but
think the Marquis was a very polite gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
He had ſcarce parted from her, when
another Marquis De Racan was announced.
She naturally ſuppoſed that it was the firſt,
who had forgotten to ſay ſomething to her,
and returned for this purpoſe; when, to her
great ſurprize, another ſtranger entered. She
could not help queſtioning him repeatedly if
he was the real Marquis De Racan; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him of what had juſt paſſed. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Racan appeared very much hurt; and
declared, that he would be revenged of the
inſult the ſtranger had mutually offered them.
But, to cut the matter ſhort, Mademoiſelle De
Gournay ſoftened the choleric man; and was
infinitely pleaſed with the ſecond Marquis De
Racan, who exceeded the firſt in every reſpect.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:1020400300:482"/>
Scarce had this ſecond counterfeit Racan iſſued,
when the <hi>real Racan</hi> was announced! This
began to exerciſe the patience of Mademoiſelle
De Gournay. 'What, more Racans in one
morning!' ſhe exclaimed. However, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſee the third. As ſoon as he entered,
ſhe raiſed her voice, and aſked him if he meant
to inſult her? Racan, who, at the beſt, was but
an indifferent ſpeaker, remained ſilent with
aſtoniſhment. He muttered ſomething; and
Mademoiſelle de Gournay, who was naturally
violent and iraſcible, imagined that he was ſent
to impoſe upon her. She pulled off her ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and fell upon the real and unfortunate
Racan with the rage of an irritated virago, and
made him gladly retreat from a viſit where he
had expected to meet with a very different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>

pleaſe in declamation, having mounted the

quit the pulpit would have been diſhonourable;
to ſpeak was more difficult, for he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

extremity? He reſolved to remain collected,
and to make the beſt uſe of his voice and action,
without pronouncing any thing but uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
words, imperfect ſentences, and pathetic
exclamations: ſuch as <hi>fors, buts, ifs, yets,

a thouſand graceful manners. The pulpit
ſhook; and the vault of the church, which was
vaſt, re-echoed to all the vociferations he ſent
forth. The audience preſerved a profound
ſilence: every one inclined his ear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled

were never ſpoken. Thoſe who ſat near the
pulpit, ſaid—'We are too near; we cannot
hear a ſentence!' Thoſe who ſat remote, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the diſtance, which cauſed them to
loſe the moſt wonderful ſermon they ever

in this manner for three quarters of an

When he withdrew, their acclamations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

they ſpeak ſo much concerning the great Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge-Pot
of the Cordeliers of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
It is, in fact, a ſingular piece: it can
contain from five to ſix hundred pounds of
meat, and near two tuns of water; ſo that it is
no trifling occupation with thoſe good Fathers
to make a ſoup. This deep Pot, broad and
high in proportion to it's depth, does not admit
of any thing being put in or drawn out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
aſcending a ladder. A gluttonous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier
always took the opportunity, when the
cooks were gone to church, to repair there, and
ſteal ſome delicious bit from this enormous
Pot. He drew it up with an iron fork, and
conveyed it to his cell, to regale himſelf, with
two or three others of his comrades who had
the ſecret of conveying wine from the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:1020400300:487"/>
This Monk having one day mounted the
ladder, to draw, as uſual, ſome delicate morſel
from the Pot, which then happened to be not
more than two-thirds full, he was obliged to
ſtretch himſelf to an unuſual degree; and
the fork, by the ponderous weight of the piece
he had greedily ſtuck it into, ſlipped from his
hands. He did his beſt to extricate it; but,
overturned by his own weight and eagerneſs,
he tumbled into the Pot, and was ſoon ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
without any power of aſſiſtance, in the
boiling lake of broth. A few hours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the cooks came to ſerve the refectory.
All the broth was emptied, the baſons were
filled, and brought to their uſual places for the
uſe of the religioniſts. They then returned, to
bring the meat from the Pot; but how great
was their ſurprize, when, on aſcending the
ladder, the firſt piece that preſented itſelf was
the unfortunate Cordelier, quite entire! With
great labour they hauled him out. The Prior,
who was privately informed of this ſingular
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:1020400300:488"/>
incident, thought proper to have him conveyed

               <p>I IMAGINE, that when our <hi>Coſways</hi> viſit each
other, if it happens that their friend is not at
home, they are incapable, by the perfection of
their art, to leave any peculiar beauties behind
them, of which a Connoiſſeur could ſay—'Certainly <hi>Coſway</hi> has been here to-day; for

               <p>The ancient <hi>Apelles,</hi> on a viſit to a brother
Artiſt, acted in this manner—He went pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to Rhodes to ſee <hi>Protogenes.</hi> When he
arrived at the Painter's houſe, he found him
abſent; but, obſerving on his eaſel an unfiniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
picture, he ſnatched a bruſh, and drew a
line exquiſitely delicate. When the ſlave
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:1020400300:489"/>
aſked him to leave his name, he anſwered—'Your maſter will know who I am when he
ſees his picture.' The ſlave, on his maſter's
return, informed him of what had paſſed.
Protogenes, examining the line, exclaimed—'This muſt be by the hand of Apelles! he
is certainly at Rhodes!' He took up the
bruſh, and drew another line ſtill more delicate
than the former; and inſtructed the ſlave,
when the ſtranger ſhould return, only to ſhew
him that line. Apelles returned; and, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he beheld himſelf ſurpaſſed! But what
did he do? He took the bruſh, and <hi>divided</hi> the
line of Protogenes into two parts by a third,
which it was impoſſible a fourth could divide.
Protogenes, when he examined it, exclaimed—'Now do I know, for certain, that Apelles is

intermarriage which overcame the enmity
of the two Courts of France and Spain, though
it could not that of the two nations, preſents
us with a humorous contraſt of their manners,
diſpoſitions, habits, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>' A Frenchman,' ſays our Author, 'enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for ſome refreſhment: a Spaniard would rather
periſh with hunger or thirſt. A Frenchman
ſalutes a lady by kiſſing her: a Spaniard, on
preſenting a lady his hand, will cover it with
his cloak, and retreat back ſeveral paces to bow
to her at a hundred ſteps diſtant.</p>

' I have often been tempted,' ſays the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
who was a Spaniard, 'to aſk the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
if it was poſſible that a French child
could be brought into the world in the ſame
manner as a Spaniſh infant—ſo diſſimilar they
prove from their birth!</p>
               <p>' The French have a lively apprehenſion,
hating idleneſs, and reducing their knowledge
into practical uſe; but they do not penetrate
deeply into any matter. The Spaniard, on the
contrary, is fond of abſtract and abſtruſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
and dwells continually on an object.
The French are afraid of believing too much;
the other, of believing too little. The former
will diſpatch the weightieſt buſineſs in the midſt
of noiſe and tumult, amidſt the levity of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
or gaieties of the table; whilſt the
grave Spaniard cannot bear the buzzing of a
fly to diſturb his fixed attention. In love, the
one are light and talkative; the other, conſtant
and ſecret. The Spaniard will diſguiſe his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
under a thouſand pretences, and invent

whilſt the Frenchman will preſs his wants
upon you with the moſt perſevering impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
In every minutia, this difference
is traced; both at the toilette and table:
in mixing wine, the Spaniard puts the water
firſt in the glaſs; whilſt the Frenchman puts
the wine firſt. A troop of Frenchmen will
walk abreaſt in the ſtreet with abundance of
tattle; whilſt the Spaniards will walk with
meaſured gravity, in a defile, like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
A Frenchman, diſcovering a perſon
at a diſtance, beckons with an uplifted hand,
drawn towards his face: the Spaniard bends
his hands downwards, and moves it towards
his feet.'</p>
               <p>This contraſt of humours and manners he

climate: in the one country, ſettled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;

               <head>ANIMALS IMITATE LANGUAGE AND
ACTION.</head>
               <p>SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE, in his Memoirs,
relates a ſtory concerning an old Parrot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Prince Maurice, that readily
anſwered to ſeveral queſtions promiſcuouſly
put to it. However ſingular the fact may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
he aſſures us it was told him as ſuch by
the Prince himſelf.</p>
               <p>Scaliger tells us, that he ſaw a Crow, in the
French King's court, that was taught to fly at
Partridges, or any other fowl, from the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner's
hand.</p>
               <p>Cardinal Aſſanio had a Parrot that was
taught to repeat the Apoſtles Creed, verbatim,
in Latin; and in the court of Spain there was
one that could ſing the Gamut perfectly.</p>
               <p>In the Roman Hiſtory an anecdote is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
the truth of which we have no reaſon
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:1020400300:494"/>
to doubt. When the ſovereignty of the world
was depending between Caeſar and Antony, a
poor man at Rome bred up two Crows; and
taught them to pronounce, in their prattling
language, a ſalutation to the Emperor: and,
that he might be provided againſt all events,
one of them ſaluted Caeſar, and the other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony.
When Auguſtus was returning as the
conqueror, this man, with the Crow on his
hand, met him; and it was an ingenious and
agreeable flattery, to which Auguſtus was not
inſenſible, to be ſaluted by a Crow with the
acclamations of victory. He rewarded the
novel adulator munificently. The neighbour
of the man, however, having in vain eſſayed
to teach the ſame language to two Crows he
had deſtined for this purpoſe, ſtung with
envy at his happier fate, revealed to Auguſtus
that this man had another Crow at his houſe,
which he had intended to have ſaluted Antony,
had Fortune favoured his party. This mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:1020400300:495"/>
intelligence intercepted the bounty of
Auguſtus.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, nothing appears more wonderful
than the ſight of an unwieldy Elephant danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The manner of teaching this grave ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſo ludicrous an action is thus cruelly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed—They bring a <hi>young Elephant</hi> upon an iron
floor heated underneath; and play on a muſical
inſtrument, while he lifts up his legs, and ſhifts
his feet about, by reaſon of the torture of the
heat. This, frequently repeated, occaſions him
to dance at the leaſt ſound of muſic.</p>
               <p>But let us not ſuppoſe, that animals that
thus imitate the actions and language of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creatures, poſſeſs, therefore, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
rationality and mental intelligence: for
when an Elephant, for inſtance, dances to
muſic, it is not from any principles of reaſon,
but from the concatenation of the two ideas of
<hi>heat</hi> and <hi>muſic,</hi> to which cuſtom has habituated
him. So a Parrot may anſwer any queſtion it
is accuſtomed to hear; but this action needs
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:1020400300:496"/>
not the aid of reaſon, ſince it may be effected
by <hi>an habitual idea</hi> of things. Even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
ranks of animals receive their <hi>ideas</hi> by
the <hi>ſenſes.</hi> Such and ſuch ſounds often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
and ſuch and ſuch actions immediately
preceding or immediately following thoſe
ſounds, muſt neceſſarily form a <hi>complex idea</hi>
both of the ſound and action; ſo that, when
either ſuch action or ſuch ſound is repeated, an
idea of the other muſt neceſſarily attend it.
Thus Dogs are taught to fetch and carry; and
Parrots ſpeak more words than one together.
Theſe words, <hi>Poor Poll!</hi> for inſtance, being
often repeated together, if one be mentioned,
and the other left, there muſt neceſſarily be an
idea of the other ſound, becauſe cuſtom and
habit link them together. As two words are
taught, ſo may three; and, if three, why not
many? It is thus, by a <hi>complex idea,</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
dances; for, when he hears muſic, the
idea of the heated floor occaſions him to
dance.</p>

                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:1020400300:497"/>
The arguments here alledged for the power

               <p>THERE can be no doubt that <hi>Noah</hi> was the
Pagan <hi>Saturn.</hi> Noah was a juſt man in his
days: he endeavoured to enlighten the wicked
race amongſt whom he lived by his counſels,
and to inſtruct them by his example. Thus,
according to Aurelius Victor, and Diodorus,
Saturn ſoftened the wicked inclinations of
men, and endeavoured to bring them back to
their ancient purity of manners, by a civilized
and regulated life.</p>
               <p>Between the Deluge and the birth of Phaleg
there was an interval of one hundred years;
when, the world not being yet ſhared out,
Noah had a natural right to be the Sovereign
of his children. This is the Golden Age the
Poets ſo much celebrate, where every thing
was in common.</p>
               <p>

Moſes calls Noah, <hi>Iſch—hadama—</hi> that is, the
Man of the Earth—for Labourer.</p>
               <p>The Mythologiſts, who accommodated
their Fables to Hiſtory, obſerving that the
Hebrew word bore two ſignifications, either
<hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Huſband,</hi> ſay, that <hi>Rhea,</hi> or the Earth,
was the wife of Saturn; and, as the Man of
the Earth alſo relates to Agriculture, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to Saturn the art of cultivating fields,
vines, and meadows, repreſenting him with a
ſcythe in his hands.</p>
               <p>From the paſſage in Geneſis, where it is ſaid
Noah was intoxicated with the liquor of the
vines he had planted, they have ſaid alſo that
Saturn preſided over Ebriety. Hence they
called that day in the year in which the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
attended their ſlaves, <hi>The Saturnalian
Feaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Plato ſays, in his Timaeus, that Saturn, Rhea,
and their family, were born of the Ocean and
Thetis; which correſponds with Noah and his
family coming from the waters of the Deluge.</p>

Saturn had, for ſucceſſors, his three children,
Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto; and Noah ſhared
out the earth to his three ſons, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth. This laſt, who is Neptune, had for his
portion all the iſles and peninſulas of the ſea.</p>
               <p>Moſes ſays, that God conſecrated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

muſt have been the greateſt enemy of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
it is very probable that, hating him,
they made him Pluto, who is the god of Hell

               <p>Cham, or Ham, had for his portion Africa,
Arabia, and Egypt; which, after his name,
was anciently called Chemie, where he was
adored, during many ages, under the name of
Jupiter Ham, Hammon, &amp;c. And why the
Pagans ſaid of Jupiter, that he <hi>cut</hi> thoſe parts

               <p>THE fate of the Latin Tongue may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into ſix Ages. The Barbarous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated
Age; the Middle Age; the Golden,

               <p>The Barbarous Age laſted from four to five
hundred years; from Romulus, in whoſe reign
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:1020400300:508"/>
more Greek than Latin was ſpoken, till Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
Andronicus, the firſt who cauſed Plays to
be acted at Rome.</p>
               <p>The Middle Age extends itſelf from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus
till the days of Cicero. During this
interval of time, many Authors began to write
the Latin Language. The moſt diſtinguiſhed
are, Ennius, Naevius, Plautus, Terence, and
Lucretius. The Poem of the laſt writer does
ſo much honour to this Age, that we muſt
candidly acknowledge, it would not be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
even of the Golden Age of pure Latinity,
were it ſomewhat leſs obſcure.</p>
               <p>The Golden Age of the Latin Language be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in the reign of Circero, and finiſhed
with the reign of Auguſtus; ſo that, without a
metaphor, it is but an Age. Then flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Varro, Cicero, Julius Caeſar, Cornelius
Nepos, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Severus Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novanus,
Salluſt, and others; a part of whoſe

The Silver Age, which commences at the
death of Auguſtus, and terminates with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine
the Pious, was very fruitful in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
compoſitions; but it's Language began to
loſe ſomewhat of it's richneſs and it's purity,
in ſpite of the indefatigable Quintilian, who
vainly attempted to revive the Golden Age.
Seneca, whoſe ſtyle is one continued affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

points, antitheſis, and other trivial ſports of

ſhocks a correct taſte. It was him who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Latin Language.</p>
               <p>The Age of Braſs commences from the reign
of Antonine, and reaches till Honorius, under
whoſe reign the invaſions of the Barbarians
took place. Beſides profane Authors, who

than to detract any thing from the worth

their imperfections being rejected; for it is
neither ſo boiſterous as <hi>the Dutch,</hi> nor ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate

               <p>Mr. Sheridan thus ingeniouſly has written
on the ſame topic—'Upon a fair compariſon,
it will appear that <hi>the French</hi> have emaſculated
their Tongue, by rejecting ſuch numbers of
their conſonants; and made it reſemble one of
their painted <hi>Courtezans,</hi> adorned with frip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries

indeed, but not manly. That <hi>the Italian</hi>
has beauty, grace, and ſymmetry, like the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

               <p>I contemplate with great pleaſure the claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical

When I recollect the ſweetneſs of

               <p>The Golden Age of the Engliſh Language,
however, ſeems approaching to it's firſt ſtate.
Nothing contributes ſo much to corrupt it's
purity as an inundation of Frech tranſlations,
rather than tranſlations from the French. The
avarice of ſome, and the hunger of others, are
continually pouring on us whole volumes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured

whole ſentences in French are aukwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
as improvements, doubtleſs, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the deficiences of Engliſh Language, or
rather thoſe of the Tranſlator.</p>
               <p>Yet, it muſt be confeſſed, there are ſome few
<hi>French words</hi> which, with great felicity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
a ſenſe of which we have no exact or

uſe of phraſes which may ſerve tolerably well

to cenſure our Language. Perhaps, he
was no competent judge of it's demerits; at

now a century ſince he flouriſhed; and, if we
reflect on the ſtate of our Language in his day,
it will not be found totally unjuſt.</p>
               <p>' The ſtyle of the Engliſh writers is long
and embarraſſed, very difficult to tranſlate into
Latin, into French, or into Italian. We muſt
recollect this when we read the works of the
Engliſh Authors in their own language with
an intention to tranſlate them. Perhaps, the
Engliſh would bear better to be tranſlated into
Spaniſh than into French, as the French is
more happily rendered into Greek than into
Latin. The Italian will find no language which,
without injuring it's delicacies and it's dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutives,
can afford a verſion. The German
Language is well enough adapted to the

Sir Richard Steele, ſo celebrated for

Grammar, accompanied with excellent Notes.
The Grammar of Dr. Wallis is only proper
for thoſe who are converſant with the Latin.'</p>
               <p>Perhaps, the above-mentioned Grammar
is quite forgotten. I have in my poſſeſſion 'A
Grammar of the Engliſh Tongue, with Notes,
giving the Grounds and Reaſon of Grammer
in general,' printed for John Brightland, 1711.'
To which is prefixed, 'The Approbation of

Richard Steele, dreſſed out in maſquerade.
He ſays, 'that this Grammer of the Engliſh

Tongue has done that juſtice to our Language
which, till now, it never obtained. The <hi>Text</hi>

all my female correſpondents to buy, read, and
ſtudy, this Grammar, that their letters may be

               <p>THERE is this difference between theſe three
Languages. The <hi>Italian</hi> owes much of it's
merit and it's ſoftneſs to it's peculiar turn of
phraſe, and the manner in which it employs
it's diminutives: thus it expreſſes, with
great felicity, the ſentiments of Love. The
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> draws all it nobleneſs, and it's pomp,
from gigantic expreſſions and hyperboles, of
which no other Language will admit. The
<hi>French</hi> appears to hold a middle rank between
theſe two Languages: it can expreſs with
ſtrength and vivacity the Language of Reaſon,
by repreſenting things as they are; it is thus
well calculated for the compoſitions of Hiſtory,
Controverſy, Theology, and Philoſophy. It
ſeems, however, to be very unfortunate in
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:1020400300:520"/>
it's Poetical productions: the French are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aware of it themſelves; but there is no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
ear that has been accuſtomed to Engliſh
verſification, that can bear with any degree of
patience it's tireſome monotony. A French
Poet, who was as great an admirer of Latin
verſes as of wine, compares French verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the drinking of water. It's ſatiric
verſe, however, has the preference.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Italian,</hi> of all the European Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
after the French, is the moſt general in
uſe. The facility with which it is acquired,
is one great cauſe of it's univerſality. Yet it
muſt be remarked, that if it is attained in ſome

appeared in 1620; and ſome time afterwards,
a Grammar, by Jean Maire, printed at Leyden
in 1636, to which are appended the Fables of
Lockman. The Arabic Language is intelligent
and energetic. It is full of graceful turns,
and figurative expreſſions, which give it great
elevation and ſtrength. It is harmonious; and
it's good Authors increaſe it's natural har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
by the care they take in their proſaic
compoſitions, to vary their periods, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce

               <p>ALMOST all thoſe writers who have treated
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:1020400300:528"/>
on the Hebrew Language, would fain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
us, that it is the firſt that men have
ſpoken: but—what is more impertinent in
them—they have the aſſurance to inform us
that it is the Language of God himſelf; nor
is this opinion by any means novel, ſince Saint
Gregory of Nyſſa has, even in his life-time,
reprobated the idea, and calls it a folly, and a
ridiculous vanity of the Jews; as if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſays, had been a maſter of Grammar.
La Motte le Vayer writes in his Letters, that
the moſt partial partizans which ever the
Hebrew has had, muſt confeſs, that excepting
the inferior Languages, ſuch as the Baſk and
the Breton, &amp;c. there is not among the living
or the dead Languages, any which do not
preſent us with more valuable compoſitions
than the Hebrew does, if we except the Old
Teſtament. He adds, that he can well do
without making uſe of a barbarous jargon that
never repays us for the laceration which it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions

               <p>The Hebrew Grammars which the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
have compoſed, are infinitely more perfect
than thoſe of the Jews. Their knowledge in
the writings of their Rabbins is not inferior;
and to this they have added a clear and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
method, which is very neceſſary in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
whoſe idioms and modes of expreſſion
the great diſtance of time has ſo obſcured,
that it is almoſt impoſſible to attain to any
perfect knowledge, or to decide with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

               <p>Buxtorf, the father, has ſurpaſſed all thoſe

Ludolphus has given us a Grammar of the

               <p>One Louis de Dieu has given a Perſian

               <p>A Tartarian Grammar has been given by

               <head>ON THE USE OF THE PAGAN MYTHOLOGY
IN POETRY.</head>
               <p>A REVOLUTION has taken place in modern
Poetry, which is of the greateſt importance to
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:1020400300:533"/>
the lovers of the art. This is no leſs than a
total baniſhment of the Heathen Mythology
from our Poetry. The great <hi>Johnſon</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
not infrequently, a ſingularity of opinion
to an enforcing of truth—or, let us confeſs,
who has given ſtrong marks of a deficiency in
poetical taſte—has confounded the beauties of
the Pagan Mythology with it's abuſe. We
are to read the criticiſms of this great man
with caution; we muſt recollect that, in his
examination of <hi>Milton,</hi> his prejudices warp
his judgment; and, in his animadverſions on
<hi>Gray,</hi> his criticiſms were uncandid and unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical.
He tells us, in his Life of <hi>Prior,</hi>
'That his fictions are Mythological, and that
they are ſurely deſpicable:' for he adds—'By
the help of ſuch eaſy fictions, and vulgar
topics, without acquaintance with life, and
without knowledge of art or nature, a poem
of any length, cold and lifeleſs like this, may
be eaſily written on any ſubject.'</p>
               <p>This is dictated by the uncharitable ſpirit of
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:1020400300:534"/>
criticiſm. It is ſtrange, that a man of ſuch
active faculties, and of ſuch critical ſagacity,
ſhould not have perceived, that when the Poet
wanders in the unbounded regions of Fancy,
he hath little to do with the mere ſtate of
Nature; that, expatiating in the wide range
of Imagination, he does not ſo much <hi>borrow</hi>
from Nature, but rather <hi>adorns</hi> her by the
creation of new beings. Hence the pipe of
the ſhepherd is the <hi>ſhrill ſhell of Pan</hi>; the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
of the waters is <hi>the ſigh of the Naiad</hi>;
and the dewy flowers, that ſparkle on the eye,
are the <hi>glittering tears of Aurora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will allow that a Pedant, well-read in his
Pantheon, may produce, what ſome may be
apt to take for a Poem, by a mere mechanical
effort. He may call Apollo and the Muſes,
Minerva and Venus; but let him beware of
what he is about. Theſe celeſtial beings are
no leſs dangerous than what, in our Britiſh
Solomon's time, was thought to be the raiſing
of the devil; of whom one ſaid, that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:1020400300:535"/>
not, with book in hand, he could raiſe him
eaſily enough; but, when he had done that,
the danger lay in the manner he was to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his devilſhip. The Pedant may, indeed,
lug into his verſe the reluctant Gods and
Godeſſes; but they will not have the air of
divinities. It requires the moſt ſkilful hand,
and ſome of the fineſt touches of genius, to
place them in a novel ſituation; to poliſh the
finiſhed piece into claſſical beauty, and exhauſt
on them the pomp and brilliancy of his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>Let us not, then, haſtily reſign our faith, in
the theology of ancient Poetry. If it appears
trite and inſipid in the hands of a mere verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,
let us reflect, that every thing in ſuch a
writer will have the ſame effect. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that no order of beings have yet been
found ſo agreeable to the imagination, when
this poetic machinery is diſplayed by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of ſuperior genius. How admirably has
<hi>Gray,</hi> in his Progreſs of Poetry, embelliſhed
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:1020400300:536"/>
with theſe beautiful forms the third ſtanza of
the firſt Antiſtrophy. Allegorical Perſonages,
which <hi>Spenſer</hi> has unfortunately employed,
ſoon weary. The enchantment of mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
fiction is continued, and is ſuſceptible of
continual variety.</p>
               <p>The omnipotence of the divinities of Poetry
is eternal: it is true, they do not always yield
their inſpiration. Venus ſtill reſides in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos;
Diana ſtill embelliſhes the woods; the
Nymphs inhabit their accuſtomed oak; and
there is not a pure ſtream but, in it's cryſtaline
cave, is ſtill honoured with the preſence of it's
Naiad.</p>
               <p>I venerate the abilities of this our late <hi>Cory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeus</hi>;
but, if we are blindly to follow the
<hi>dictum</hi> of our leader, farewel to that free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
by which, through the medium of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinions, we at length attain to truth. The
critical powers of <hi>Boileau</hi> may well be oppoſed
to thoſe of <hi>Johnſon</hi>; and however the Engliſh
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:1020400300:537"/>
dreſs, which Sir <hi>William Soame</hi> has given him,
may be inferior to the original <hi>Boileau,</hi> he may
yet be underſtood.</p>

               <head>ON THE POETRY OF BARON HALLER.</head>
               <p>IT was once the intention of the Editor to have
preſented a tranſlation of the Poetry of Baron
Haller to the public.</p>
               <p>The Poet, whom I am now going to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the reader, is better known in this
country for his extenſive learning and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
labours in phyſiology, than for thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
pieces which place him ſo conſpicuouſly
amongſt the modern Poets of Germany.</p>
               <p>If England hath not beſtowed on him the
honours of a Poet, France, however, hath
not been backward in this reſpect. His Poetry
hath been elegantly tranſlated, and multiplied
by repeated editions. There are thoſe who
have placed him on an equality with the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Geſner: and, perhaps, he is only not
equal to him in not having produced a Poem
of the magnitude of his Death of Abel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="523" facs="tcp:1020400300:542"/>
If it is allowed me to give the character of
Haller as a Poet, I will ſay, that he does not
ſwell into that turgid eloquence, which wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the mental eye by a cumbrous accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſplendour. It is the characteriſtic of
the German Poets, that they do not know
when to ſtop; the ſtrength of their genius
tranſports them into obſcurity: by ſoaring too
high, they ſtrain the temperate eye of the
Critics; judgment to them is a ſilken ſtring,
too feeble to chain the wing of an eagle.</p>
               <p>I do not mean, however, to countenance or
excuſe certain pieces which, they inform us,
are tranſlations from the German; and which,
indeed, may well diſguſt the world with all
German Poetry. But, I believe that the bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſt
of theſe writers is rather to be attributed
to themſelves, than to the unfortunate Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
who, certainly, had he originally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in ſo aukward a ſtyle, would not have been
thought worthy of a tranſlation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:1020400300:543"/>
Haller is beautiful in his deſcriptions, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
in his Odes, and tender in his elegies.
He is not leſs to be admired as a Satiriſt; and
Berne once trembled at the preſence of it's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal.
His numbers are highly poliſhed; and
it is hard to render juſtice to the delicate lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of his Muſe.</p>
               <p>The following Poem is not partially choſen,
but for it's convenient length. There is an
elegant ſimplicity, added to a cloſeneſs of
thought; which, if it does not always wear
the fantaſtic air of novelty, impreſſes in the
feeling heart that philoſophical conſolation
worthy of the genius of Haller.</p>
