            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

To ſhew how far Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> is concerned in, and anſwerable for the Obſervations I have made, is my preſent Deſign. In his Treatiſe entitled UNION, This Gentleman's erroneous Principles, and the licentious Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines he maintains, are very plain and evident. In the Preface to this Tract, the Author ſays, he is <q rend="inline">"Not afraid to tread the moſt unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Path, and walk therein <hi>undiſturbed,</hi> notwithſtanding the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Accuſations of <hi>Singularity, Novelty</hi> and <hi>Hereſy.</hi>"</q> I would by no Means, attempt to diſturb him in his <hi>Reveries:</hi> But as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to animadvert upon, to enter my Proteſt againſt, and by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to detect and confute ſome erroneous Poſitions, deluſive Aſſertions, and unſcriptural Doctrines he has been pleaſed to make and advance; I would therefore rather chooſe to ſubmit an Appeal to the Chriſtian World, than <hi>diſturb</hi> the Author himſelf with an Addreſs thereon. For when Error and Falſehood is advanced to the World, for the Truths of the Goſpel, and the Doctrines of Chriſtianity; I hope a Zeal for the Truth, conſiſtent with the Spirit of Meekneſs, will juſtify my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to point out ſuch Principles, try them by the Standard of GOD's Word, ſhew their Inconſiſtency with the Oracles of Truth, and the dangerous Effects and licentious Conſequences they are pregnant with, and which they muſt naturally bring forth.

               <p>
                  <hi>The glorious Oeconomy of Salvation diſplayed, in the Grace of the Holy Trinity. The Father's Love in the Gift of his Son for his People. The Love of Jeſus in their Redemption and Juſtification, and the Spirit's Energy on their Hearts, producing Repentance, Faith and Holineſs, laid down as conſiſtent with the Scripture, illuſtrated from Nature, and the Fruits and Effects demonſtrable in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preſent</hi> Antinomian <hi>unſcriptural Tenets.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE only meritorious and procuring Cauſe of the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pardon, and Salvation of Sinners, is the Life and Death atoning Blood, and ſpotleſs Righteouſneſs of the GOD-man Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:0417200700:4"/>
This is the peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Doctrine of the Goſpel of the Grace of GOD. Therefore it has been received and gloried in as ſuch, by the People of GOD in every Age of the Chriſtian Church. But that it follows from hence, that Sinners are made Partakers of Glory, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and eternal Life, without <hi>Repentance, Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denied, it being contrary to the Purpoſe and Will of GOD, as it is clearly revealed and fully expreſſed in the ſacred Pages: For, the very End and Deſign of our Lord's coming in the Fleſh, was to purchaſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for his People, the out-pouring of the Holy Spirit, under whoſe divine Energy and ſovereign Influences upon their Hearts, they are enabled to repent, believe and become obedient to the Goſpel of their Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Repentance, Faith and Holineſs, are the <hi>Graces</hi> and Bleſſings of the new Covenant. Every Member of Jeſus is made a Partaker of them. His Blood and Righteouſneſs entitles them to the Kingdom of Glory, and by theſe Graces their Souls are qualified and prepared for the Enjoyment of it: And it is exceeding plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious from the Tenor of Scripture, that the Love and Grace of GOD the Father and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is magnified, manifeſted, and diſplayed, by and thro' the Holy Spirit's Agency, in quickning, regenerating and ſanctifying the Souls of the Elect, as fully and as truly, as the Love of the Father is diſplayed by the Gift of his Son, or the Grace of our bleſſed Saviour in giving himſelf a Sacrifice for their Sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming them to GOD by his precious Blood.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the Gift of Jeſus Chriſt for loſt Sinners, is the Reſult of that Love, which dwelt in the Breaſt of GOD the Father from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to his People. And the Gift of the Holy Spirit to enlighten their Minds and ſanctify their Souls, is in Conſequence of Chriſt having undertook and finiſhed the Work of their Redemption. Jeſus being now gone to the Father, according to his moſt true Promiſe, ſends the Comforter. Jeſus being glorified as the Head, the Spirit deſcends on his Members, to accompliſh and produce ſuch ſpiritual Bleſſings upon the Heart, and in the Life of the Heirs of Promiſe, which Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> is pleaſed entirely to explode and deny, to treat with the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to ſtigmatize, as the Marks of the <hi>falſe Chriſt,</hi> and the Workings of the <hi>Spirit of Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without this inward Work upon the Heart, under the ſovereign and vital Operations of the Holy Spirit; it is plain from GOD's Word, and the Condition of Mankind in its Fallen State; as alſo from the Experience and Teſtimony of the People of GOD, in every Age of the Church, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Meſes,</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, and from Chriſt to this Day, that no Man is able of himſelf to turn to GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:0417200700:5"/>
by true Repentance, to <hi>believe with his Heart unto Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or to bring forth <hi>Fruit unto Holineſs,</hi> unto eternal Life. And if the Soul is deſtitute of theſe Graces, Profeſſion is vain and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. Notions and Opinions are lighter than Vanity. Knowledge is but pompous Ignorance, and, as yet, the Goſpel preached, has affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a Profeſſor no more than outward Sound. For, <hi>except ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ye ſhall periſh,</hi> Luke xiii. 3. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark xvi. 16. <hi>And without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii. 14. Theſe Declarations from our Saviour himſelf, and from the Spirit of Truth, will be an eternal Bar to the Salvation and Glory of every Soul that dies in an impenitent, unbelieving, unholy State, notwithſtanding all the ſoft Caſuiſtry, and artful Sophiſtry of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Deceivers.</p>
            <p>From GOD's firſt creating that great Luminary the Sun, its power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shining, invigorating Rays, enlightening and enlivening Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, have ſhed a genial Warmth and prolific Energy upon the whole Creation, whereby all Nature appears with Chearfulneſs, and is enriched with Fruitfulneſs: And, no ſooner did the Glory of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> begin to dawn, after the Darkneſs and Miſery of the Fall of Man, but with ſpiritual and heavenly Rays, Jeſus enlightened, quickened, animated and refreſhed the Hearts of his People, producing Chearfulneſs and Joy in their Soul, and Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heavenly Graces in their Life and Practice. By Virtue of their Union with Chriſt as the Source of Life, and Fountain of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, Believers <hi>receive out of his Fulneſs Grace for Grace:</hi> But more eſpecially under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, the Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Holy Spirit, is manifeſted with ſuperior Energy and meridian Brightneſs; hence is the Goſpel emphatically ſtiled <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 8.</p>
            <p>Now to allow of the Power and Influence which the Sun hath upon the Earth, and yet to deny that Life and Fruitfulneſs are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the natural World by his impregnating Rays, is contrary both to Reaſon and Obſervation in natural Things. So in ſpiritual Matters, to contend for the Union of the Soul with Jeſus, the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and yet deny that ſpiritual Life and Fruitfulneſs, is thereby communicated to his Members, is repugnant both to Scripture and Experience. And yet, however abſurd and irrational this Notion is, ſuch is Mr. <hi>Relly</hi>'s avowed Tenet. Yea, it is plain and obvious from the whole Drift of this Author's Treatiſe, that he denies and explodes what the Scripture maintains, namely, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus, are influenced to perſonal Holineſs, or, (to uſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0417200700:6"/>
Language) that they ever do or can, bring forth <hi>the Fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Phil. i. 11. <hi>Fruit unto Holineſs,</hi> Rom. vi. 22. <hi>Fruit unto GOD,</hi> chap. vii. 4. in themſelves.</p>
            <p>But well would it be for this Author, and for all thoſe who oppoſe the plain Truths of GOD, in this Point, did they but conſider this ſcriptural Diſtinction, though Believers bring forth Fruit unto GOD, <hi>in</hi> themſelves, yet not <hi>of</hi> and <hi>from</hi> themſelves. Their <hi>Sufficiency to every good Word and Work is of GOD.</hi> Being united to the Lord Jeſus, they receive, Life, Strength and Power out of his Fulneſs. They are taught by his Word, influenced by his Spirit, to live to the Glory of GOD. They partake of Holineſs in and from the Lord Jeſus, whereby, they are enabled to produce the Fruits of Holineſs and good Works in their Lives and Converſations. Though the Fruits which they bear and bring forth, do not make them holy, or are the Cauſe of their Holineſs, any more than the Grapes which grow on the Vine, make or conſtitute it a Vine, or are the Source and Cauſe of its Fruitfulneſs; yet, ſuch Fruits, which are agreeable to the Word of GOD, and produced <hi>in and by them,</hi> thro' the Grace and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of GOD, prove and evidence, that they are new Creatures in Chriſt Jeſus: That their Souls are born again of the Spirit of GOD: That they <hi>live in the Spirit,</hi> are <hi>led by the Spirit, and bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> Yea, being made good Trees, they bring forth good Fruit; and ſo anſwer our Lord's Deſcription, <hi>By their Fruits ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Juſt as plain, as that theſe Words inform us, Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> is an <hi>Iriſh Biſhop.</hi> Reader, I appeal to your Judgment. Does any Thing like it appear from the Words of the Apoſtle? Is not this Concluſion the moſt forced and unnatural; an Inference or Deduction quite Foreign to the Senſe of the Apoſtle? For the beloved Diſciple in the very next Verſe aſſerts, <hi>he that hath not the Son, hath not Life:</hi> Therefore, ſo far from its being plain, that there is not the leaſt Shadow of common Senſe or Reaſon to ſupport this Gloſs; but it is as contrary to the Apoſtle's Meaning, as Light is to Darkneſs, and Error to Truth. Amazing, that any Author ſhould attempt to palm ſuch glaring Abſurdity, ſuch palpable Falſhood upon Mankind, for the Truths of Chriſtianity!</p>
            <p>But to what End or Purpoſe is this falſe Gloſs put upon theſe Words? It is to propagate a Notion which has no Foundation in the Word of GOD, but is utterly repugnant to it; <hi>viz.</hi> A Union of Sentiment, with the Author of a ſophiſtical, unſcriptural Tract, entitled, <hi>Heaven open to all Men: or, a Theological Treatiſe, proving that</hi> all Men <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and made finally happy.</hi> This Author's Theology, and Mr. <hi>Relly</hi>'s Notion in his <hi>Treatiſe of Union,</hi> &amp;c. are quite ſimilar. For the whole World conſiſts but of two Sorts of Perſons, Believers and Unbelievers. Now that Believers in Chriſt have eternal Life, is clear from the Word of GOD: And Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> aſſerts, he that believeth not, hath eternal Life, as fully as him who believeth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to Mr. <hi>Relly, all Mankind,</hi> Believers and Unbelievers, ſhall be ſaved and made finally happy. Here lies the very Sinew of this Perſon's Deluſion: Univerſal Salvation is the grand Baſis upon which his Figment of UNION is founded. But this Path of Doctrine is unfrequented by any of the Saints of GOD: Never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Word of GOD, therefore is truly, the Path of <hi>Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, Novelty,</hi> and <hi>Hereſy.</hi> In the Sincerity of my Heart, I pray this Author may want Company, and enjoy Solitude and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Let us have Recourſe to the ſacred Oracles of Truth, and ſhew the Inconſiſtency of this Notion with GOD's revealed Will, and then we will reſcue this Text from the falſe and corrupt Opinion which it is brought to eſtabliſh. When our bleſſed Lord gave that extenſive Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, to <hi>preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> he paſſes this Declaration as the certain Effect and Conſequence, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark xvi. 16. Now will not Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> upon his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0417200700:8"/>
Hypotheſis tell us, he that is damned, hath nevertheleſs everlaſting Life in Chriſt as fully as he that is ſaved? Again, our Saviour told the <hi>Jews, If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your Sins.</hi> John viii. 24. Which Sentence ſtands forth againſt Unbelievers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eternal Life to this Day. But will Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> explain away our Lord's Meaning, and inform us, that thoſe who die in their Sins, yet have eternal Life in Chriſt? But our Lord in the ſame Chapter plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts the contrary of ſuch Perſons, <hi>whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi> And the ſame Spirit who ſpake by Jeſus, hath by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> deſcribed the awful State of ſome, to whom the Goſpel is <hi>a Savour of Death unto Death,</hi> and of others who are <hi>loſt, to whom the Goſpel is hid;</hi> and aſſigns this Reaſon for it, that <hi>the God of this World blinds the Minds of thoſe who believe not.</hi> And again he declares that <hi>the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not GOD, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power,</hi> 2 Theſ. i. 7, 8, 9. And once for all; for there is no End of quoting Paſſages of Scripture to conſute this impious and heretical Poſition. Chriſt himſelf declares, <hi>he that believeth not, is condemned already.—He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of GOD abideth on him,</hi> John iii. 18. 30.</p>
            <p>How can we reconcile a State of Wrath and Condemnation, with Poſſeſſing GOD's Love and Favour; a loſt State, and not ſeeing Life, with having eternal Life; being puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from GOD, and yet enjoying Salvation as his Gift fully given? The Bible hath no ſuch Inconſiſtency: Nor in any Part of it doth it declare that Unbelievers have eternal Life, but quite the reverſe; nor doth it teach us to ſuppoſe with the Author of <hi>Union,</hi> that all thoſe who ſhall have their Portion with Unbelievers, to whom the Lord will denounce the awful Doom, <hi>depart ye Curſed,</hi> &amp;c. yet have eternal Life as fully given them in Chriſt, as thoſe <hi>who believe to the ſaving their Souls,</hi> and on whom our Saviour will pronounce the joyful Sentence, <hi>come ye Bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. Surely before a Perſon can advance ſuch Abſurdity, he muſt be <hi>given up to a ſtrong Deluſion to believe a Lie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to wreſt the Scriptures to his own Deſtruction.</hi> It is no ſmall Degree of Art and Sophiſtry which this Author affects, ſo as to explain away the true Senſe and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture Language, and to dreſs it up in a falſe Garb, and to give ſuch a Turn to Scripture Phraſes, as beſt ſuits a vitiated

            <p>Let us now conſider the plain Senſe, and full Import of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Meaning in that Paſſage, which has been ſo groſsly perverted, and ſhockingly corrupted, to ſupport Falſhood and Hereſy. Far, very far from a fair and honeſt Quotation hath this Author given. He has tranſpoſed the Words o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Apoſtle. I ſuſpect his Deſign hereby. It is the better to accommodate the Words, to ſupport his Tenets. Elſe, why ſhould he not give his Readers the Words in the Order they are placed? Why has he exhibited them in a mangled, disjointed Form? My Reaſons for Suſpicion of Mr. <hi>Relly</hi>'s Method of quoting S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Apoſtles Words, 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of GOD hath the Witneſs in himſelf,</hi> are plain; even the Witneſs of eternal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0417200700:10"/>
Life, in and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And again, <hi>He that believeth not GOD, hath made him a Liar, becauſe he believeth not the Record which GOD hath given of his Son: i. e.</hi> that Sinners are ſaved through Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt only. It is good to compare Scripture with Scripture: And we have a Declaration from our Lord's own Mouth, which runs parallel with this, <hi>GOD ſo loved the World, as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever</hi> believeth <hi>on him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> John iii. 16. Now on the contrary, he that <hi>believeth not,</hi> he denieth, oppoſeth, and rejecteth the Way of eternal Life and Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt, and ſeeks for, and expects to find Righteouſneſs in ſome other Way and Method, contrary to the Goſpel of the Grace of GOD: and thus he gives the Lie to the Record of Truth, the Report of the everlaſting Goſpel, yea to the GOD of Truth himſelf; than which nothing doth more enhance and aggravate the Sin of Unbelief. And therefore ſo far from Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers having eternal Life, they can in no Scripture Senſe be ſaid to have Part or Lot in the Matter; perhaps never may; nay, we are aſſured never will, if they die in Unbelief. For as many as are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal Life, BELIEVE. In Verſe 11. the Apoſtle goes on, <hi>this is the Record that GOD hath given to US, eternal Life.</hi> To us! To whom? to all Mankind? No ſuch thing, as appears very clear, if we conſider to whom the Apoſtle is addreſſing himſelf. <hi>Theſe Things write I unto you</hi> that believe <hi>on the Name of the Son of GOD, that ye may know that ye have eternal Life.</hi> Hence it is very plain and obvious, the Apoſtle was not writing to, nor ſpeaking of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers at all, nor of all Mankind in General; for he afterwards fully declares the contrary, Verſe 13. <hi>we know,</hi> (we who believe) <hi>that we are of GOD, and that the whole World lieth in Wickedneſs.</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereto, he ſays, <hi>he that hath the Son hath Life;</hi> ſpiritual Life: He is quickened by Jeſus: Hath an experimental Knowledge of Chriſt by Faith: He hath the Earneſt of eternal Life: He dwells in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him: He is one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with him: (bleſſed Union! not notional, but ſcriptural:) He ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Life of eternal Glory.—But <hi>he that hath not the Son of GOD, hath not Life;</hi> he is dead, dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, deſtitute of the Life of GOD in his Soul: He is ignorant of the Love of the Father: Hath no Knowledge of Chriſt's Love, and being deſtitute of Faith in his Blood and Righteouſneſs, has no right to eternal Life, nor any Mectneſs for it, but is under the ſecond Death; if he abide in Unbelief, <hi>he ſhall not ſee Life.</hi> So that nothing is more plain, than that, without Faith in Jeſus, no Sinner can be ſaved; and that eternal Salvation is connected with Faith.</p>
            <p>

Such is the full Import, ſuch the obvious Senſe of the Apoſtle in this Paſſage. How unjuſtly it is brought to ſupport the preſent <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> Dream, and Antichriſtian Deluſion, that <hi>all Mankind</hi> ſhall be ſaved, or that any Sinner hath eternal Life, without Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; let the Chriſtian World judge. To them I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal and ſubmit the following Conſideration.</p>
            <p>When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been bitten by Serpents, <hi>the Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>make a fiery Serpent, and ſet it upon a Pole; and it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is bitten, when he</hi> looketh <hi>upon it, ſhall live,</hi> Numb. xxi. 8. Now if after <hi>Moſes</hi> had done this, he had told <hi>all the People,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"GOD hath provided an Antidote; therefore your Cure is effected, without looking to the Remedy."</q> Would not ſuch a Procedure, (as much as in him lay) counteract the Deſign of GOD, prevent the Cure, and cauſe the Death and Deſtruction of the People? This Type our Lord refers to himſelf, <hi>John</hi> iii. 14, 15. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up; that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> But if Preachers, inſtead of ſhewing the Neceſſity of Sinners <hi>looking to Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>believing</hi> on Him, that they might not periſh, but have everlaſting Life; ſhould tell Mankind, that they are <hi>all</hi> ſaved by Chriſt, and though they do not believe, have nevertheleſs eternal Life given them in Chriſt; do they not hereby oppoſe GOD's Method of Salvation, and act contrary to the Apoſtle's Practice? whoſe Advice to a ſenſible, convicted Sinner was, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts xvi. 31. and thus, as much as in them lies, do they cauſe the People to err, to deceive their own Souls, ſo as to fancy themſelves to be in a State of Salvation, when they are in a State of Wrath, and under Condemnation.</p>

Singular and unparallelled this Obſervation! According to this Gloſs, here are two Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Apoſtle, Chriſt and the Sinner, and Chriſt's Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, counted for Juſtification. But can any Man of common Senſe and Underſtanding, rather can any Chriſtian who has been taught <hi>the Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> receive and admit ſuch ſtrange and extravagant Flights of Fancy, for ſolid Scripture Truths? Surely not.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's Faith counted for Righteouſneſs! no more than the Crown of Thorns or purple Robe which was put on Jeſus in the Day of his Humiliation and Suffering, is counted for Righteouſneſs. Who is it that juſtifieth the Ungodly? <hi>it is GOD,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> What is the procuring Cauſe of Juſtification? the perfect Righteouſneſs, and ſpotleſs Obedience of Jeſus, who is the Surety for Sinners, and in their Nature, and on their Account, hath fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and yielded full Satisfaction to divine Juſtice, and this is reckoned, counted, and imputed to every convinced Sinner <hi>who believeth on Jeſus with his Heart unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> as the Scriptures teſtify, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 10. Hence <hi>GOD is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>the Juſtifier</hi> (of whom?) <hi>of him who believes in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. iii. 26. This is the plain Senſe and Meaning of this Text. That the Phraſe, <hi>his Faith,</hi> hath no other Antecedent, but <hi>him,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He worketh not, but believeth,</hi> is clear. And therefore this can have no Relation to Chriſt, but to him who believes, and works not to obtain Life: For this I appeal to every one who hath common Underſtanding to read.</p>
            <p>This Author is pleaſed to tell us next, <q rend="inline">"that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſays you are juſtified by your own Faith, which will produce Righteouſneſs in you to evidence it."</q> This is a bold Aſſertion indeed! A ſevere, if not a blaſphemous Cenſure, not only levelled againſt the Writings of the inſpired Penmen, but alſo falls upon the Perſon and Doctrine of the Lamb of GOD himſelf, who ſpake as never Man ſpake, who taught the Doctrines of Repentance, Faith and Holineſs, as abſolutely neceſſary to eternal Glory. Now Faith is ſpoken of and deſcribed in Scripture, not as any Work of Man, but as <hi>the Gift of GOD,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0417200700:13"/>
wrought in the Heart of a Sinner by the Grace and Power of his Spirit. And therefore, as the Sinner is the Subject who poſſeſſes it, and as the Heart is the Seat of it, ſo in this Senſe, it may be called our <hi>own Faith:</hi> As any Gift, which is freely beſtowed, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thus in Scripture, this Phraſe, <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> frequently occurs, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith,</hi> &amp;c. chap. iii. 28. <hi>we conclude, a Man is juſtified by Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Now I can't ſuppoſe my Reader to be ſo void of common Underſtanding, as to imagine that in theſe, or Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when we are ſaid to be juſtified <hi>by</hi> Faith, it is meant, that we are juſtified <hi>for</hi> Faith, as though it was the meritorious or procuring Cauſe of Juſtification in the Sight of GOD. No, that is effected by the perfect Righteouſneſs, Sacrifice and Blood-ſhedding of the Lord Jeſus <hi>only:</hi> And this being revealed, publiſhed, and declared by the Goſpel, as the only Refuge for loſt and periſhing Sinners to fly to. <hi>That</hi> ungodly Sinner, who is convinced of Sin, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to have Recourſe to this Method, who truſts in, relies upon, and by Faith receives, applies, and appropriates Jeſus Chriſt to his Soul, is thereby enriched with all the Privileges of the Goſpel; <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification, Pardon, Peace, Holineſs, and Salvation: juſt as a Perſon is enriched by receiving any valuable Gift. So this Gift of Righteouſneſs, which is by Jeſus Chriſt, is apprehended and received by Faith, and is <hi>unto all, and upon all them who believe:</hi> They are delivered from the Guilt of Sin, freed from the Condemnation of the Law, and Righteouſneſs is imputed to them through Faith: And thus in a ſound, Scripture Senſe, Chriſt's People are actually juſtified by Faith, as reſpecting, looking to, and receiving the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt Jeſus. But every Soul who is deſtitute of this Faith in Jeſus, is in a State of Wrath, and under the Sentence of Condemnation by the juſt and holy Law of GOD. And ſurely, that Soul who is poſſeſſed of this <hi>precious Faith,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 1.

to ſuch who are ſatisfied with it, in that Day when GOD ſhall judge the Secrets of all Hearts by Jeſus Chriſt.—But there is not wanting a Cloud of Witneſſes, as an inconteſtible Proof of the Nature and Evidences of a true Faith, and that by it, the Worthies of Old <hi>wrought Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. their Names and their Works ſtand on Record in the eleventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as a ſtimulating Example to all ſucceeding Believers, and as a Contraſt to all carnal, diſſolute and licentious Profeſſors of the Religion of the Bible.</p>
            <p>Thus in full Contradiction to this <hi>Author</hi>'s whimſieal Notion of <hi>Union,</hi> the Scriptures abundantly ſhew and declare, what is the Nature of a real, vital Union of Chriſt with Believers, by the Fruits and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which reſult from it.

               </p>

            <p>IN the laſt Chapter we have ſeen the Effects of a truly Chriſtian Faith rejected, in this we ſhall ſee the Cauſe denied by thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Author, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſpiritual and ſupernatural Change which paſſeth upon the Heart and State of Believers under the Agency and Influence of the Holy Spirit, producing Repentance unto Life, Faith unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sanctification unto Holineſs of Heart and Life. Now Jeſus is truly glorified by theſe divine Effects appearing in his Members; whereby, the Underſtanding, which is naturally dark, is enlightened: The Will which is ſtubborn and contrary to the Will of GOD, is bowed and brought into Subjection; and the Affections which are alienated from GOD and his Truths, are brought to love and eſteem Jeſus, and the Way of Salvation by him.</p>
            <p>Though to ſave Appearance of not <hi>totally</hi> denying the Work of the Spirit, Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> is pleaſed to tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 108, he <q rend="inline margQuotes">"would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſpeaking lightly of the Spirit of Truth, or of his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Heart of Man, according to the Scripture Account thereof, which is there undeniably made, to conſiſt in receiving the Things which are his (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt,) and in ſhewing them to us; that Jeſus alone might be glorified."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I would aſk, and appeal to Scripture, is this the only Work and Office of the Holy Spirit? Is there no Work wrought by his divine Energy in and upon the Heart of GOD's People?

By the Holy Ghoſt they are enlightened, convinced of Sin; Faith is wrought in their Hearts by his Power; <hi>Repentance unto Salvation is granted</hi> unto them; they are ſanctified, and led by the Spirit; and through the Spirit are enabled to mortify the Deeds of the Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 13. GOD's <hi>Spirit bears Witneſs with their Spirits, that they are the Children of GOD,</hi> chap. viii. 16. <hi>And ſeals them unto the Day of eternal Redemption,</hi> Eph. iv. 30. Thus doth the Scripture of Truth teſtify of the Work of the Spirit, on the Hearts of the Members of Jeſus, producing theſe holy and happy Effects. But in direct Oppoſition to all this, Hear Mr. <hi>Relly</hi>'s Declaration, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Spirit of Error pretends to ſhew Mankind other Excellencies than what are found in Jeſus.

For ſurely, what is GOD's Will and good Pleaſure to work in and by his People, muſt in the Nature of Things be good, well-pleaſing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his Sight. To ſay otherwiſe muſt be aſcribing the groſſeſt Abſurdity to GOD, yea, the moſt ſhocking Blaſphemy againſt him. Thus are Believers <hi>inwardly</hi> ſanctified through Faith in the Blood of Jeſus, and by the Power of his Spirit, unto actual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Heart and Life, to which they are called; and are <hi>ſtrengthened by the Spirit in the inner Man, to delight in the Law of GOD,</hi> and to <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> in every good Word and Work. And to confront this Author's Aſſertion; St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts Believers <hi>to do Good</hi> and to communicate, expresſly aſſerting, that with ſuch <hi>Sacrifices GOD is well-pleaſed,</hi> Heb. xiii. 15.</p>
            <p>As in the firſt Creation, the Almighty Fiat called forth Fruit from the Earth, and it was ſo: So likewiſe, in the <hi>new Creation,</hi> in the Souls of Believers, the ſame ſovereign Voice in his Word, through the Power of his Spirit, calls forth Fruitfulneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Graces in the Heart, and the outward Fruits of good Works
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0417200700:24"/>
in the Life of new Creatures, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>the Seed of GOD remaineth in them,</hi> 1 John iii. 9. And though the Earth is of itſelf ſluggiſh, inert Matter, incapable of producing Fruits, yet as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the influence of the Elements, Vegetation and Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is increaſed; ſo in the new Creation, Believers who are in their natural and earthly State, dead and inactive to ſpiritual Actions, yet under the Influences of GOD's Spirit, through Means he is pleaſed to own and bleſs, ſuch as attending the Ordinances, Prayer, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Meditation, the Goſpel preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, the Soul is made Fruitful in Knowledge, Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>increaſeth with the Increaſe of GOD,</hi> Col. ii. 19. in ſuch Things as are good, acceptable and well-pleaſing to GOD, through Jeſus Chriſt. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to Believers, <hi>We beſeech you Brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jeſus, that as you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of us, how you ought to walk and to</hi> PLEASE <hi>GOD, ſo you would</hi> ABOUND <hi>more and more,</hi> 1 Theſ. iv. 1. And the beloved Diſciple, <hi>John</hi> iii. 22. teſtifies, <hi>we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe Things which are</hi> pleaſing <hi>in his Sight.</hi> Thus doth it appear that Jeſus is Sanctification to his Members. Being united to him, they derive Sanctification from him, inwardly in their Souls, which ſhews itſelf out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in a holy Walk. And indeed the very End of Believers being dead to the Law, to all Hopes and Expectations of obtaining Salvation for the Sake of their own Works is, that being influenced by evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles, Faith and Love, they might <hi>live unto GOD.</hi> Hence, ſaith he, <hi>Sin ſhall not have the Dominion over you,</hi> (that believe) <hi>becauſe ye are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> Rom. vi. 14. Not under Fears of Wrath and Hell, but under a Senſe of Love and Salvation. And what Inference doth the Apoſtle draw from hence? Doth he join with the licentious and horrid Aſſertion ſo much uſed by ſome in this our Day, <q rend="inline">"The more Sin you commit, the more Glory you bring to the Merits of Chriſt"</q>? No! he deteſts and abhors ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. <hi>What then, ſhall we ſin becauſe we are not under the Law, but under Grace? GOD forbid!</hi> ver. 15. And every one who is influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the ſame Spirit, by whoſe Teaching <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, will join him and ſay, <hi>far from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, in every Point of View, we ſee the Doctrines of Grace are <hi>according to Godlineſs,</hi> they have no Tendency to Libertiniſm and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs: Neither diſcourage the Performance of good Works, nor encourage in Sin, but lead to Holineſs in all Manner of Converſation, and to thoſe Things which are ſpiritually good, well-pleaſing and acceptable with GOD. It is true, there were from the Beginning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0417200700:25"/>
thoſe, who <hi>wreſted the Scripture to their own Deſtruction;</hi> perverted the Truths of GOD; <hi>ungodly Mex, who turned the Grace of GOD, i. e.</hi> (the Doctrines of the Goſpel of the Grace of GOD) <hi>into Laſciviouſneſs.</hi> So it is in this our Day. Is not the Author of UNION, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> acting thus? Do not his Writings fully prove it? For, according to Mr. <hi>Relly</hi>'s Doctrine, neither the Law nor the Goſpel, the Fear nor the Love of GOD, ever produce any Effect or Influence in the Life and Converſation of Chriſtians, of a good, holy or righteous Nature. Nay, ſo far is he from teaching or exhorting Men to this, that he is at the Pains (according to his uſual and very ingenuous Method) to mangle a Text, to diſcourage and reprove, what he deems, ſuch unchriſtian Practice.</p>
            <p>Thus ſays this Author, <hi>p.</hi> 126. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Our Saviour reproved the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> in the ſharpeſt Manner, for growing rich and increaſing in Goods,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is another glaring Inſtance of this Writer's handling the Word of GOD deceitfully. It is not ſufficient with him to deny and oppoſe the plain Truths of GOD, but he alſo takes the Liberty to mutilate the Senſe and alter the Meaning thereof. For, there is no ſuch Reproof to be found in all the Book of GOD. On the Contrary, St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts Believers, <hi>to do Good and be rich in good Works,</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 18. The plain Truth here is, our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Church was, <hi>becauſe thou ſayeſt I am rich,</hi> &amp;c.

She fancied her State to be, what in reality it was not, as the Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 17. fully ſhews. Therefore our Saviour, ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> for being rich and increaſed in Goods, in a ſpiritual Senſe, that he gives her Advice in the next Verſe how ſhe might become ſo. <hi>I counſel th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now what a ſhocking Perverſion of our Lord's Meaning is here!
