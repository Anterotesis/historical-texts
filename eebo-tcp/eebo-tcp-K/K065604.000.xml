         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

down to write my defenſe of
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh

a little moved at the treatment
you had been pleaſed to give to one or two
of thoſe Great Men, whom I am proud to call
my Maſter, and whoſe memories on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I ſhall always reverence and honour.
<hi>But now,</hi> you tell me, <hi>I may be ſuppoſed cool.</hi>
I am ſo: partly through the length of time
that has intervened; and partly by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſeverity of the diſcipline you have
undergone. It has had, I ſee, a marvellous
effect upon you. One may plainly perceive
an alteration, notwithſtanding your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to conceal it, not only in your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0030600600:9"/>
but in your language, your behaviour,
and your very air. You no longer breathe
that ſuperiority and contempt of all mankind
you were wont to ſhew. This change in you
has greatly mitigated <hi>the paſſion</hi> with which I
was before <hi>overcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this calm and cool ſtate therefore when

ſtartled at my own audaciouſneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
in entring the liſts againſt ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable

find, this preſumption of mine appeared ſo
extraordinary, that though you are ſo good as
to qualify it by the ſofter name of <hi>courage,
you could not but admire it, it ſeemed unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to you, till you reflected on my ſeeming ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

are fair and candid men. What ſhould
make them otherwiſe? Are their opinions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted

this the Caſe; yet ſurely there would be
found among them fair and candid men. I
am ſure I know many ſuch among another
ſet of men in theſe very circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Ay, but this other ſet of men, you will
ſay, have nothing but truth to defend. I
grant it. And I take this to be the caſe of
the Mathematicians likewiſe. They are at
leaſt as good reaſoners as any other ſet of
men whatſoever, and conſequently are as
likely to know truth, when they meet it, and
have nothing to hinder them from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it. It is therefore on their judgment,
not their favour, that I depend.</p>
               <p>But you ſpeak of <hi>the ignorance of the other
part of my Readers.</hi> Alas! Sir, of what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
can that be to me? To me, <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethes,</hi>
who aim at truth alone, who have
no intereſt in deceiving them?</p>
               <p>Were I indeed the Author of the Minute
Philoſopher: <hi>Had</hi> I any <hi>other end to ſerve
than truth</hi>: Were I maſter of aſſurance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to miſlead my reader at the inſtant
that I call out to him to mind his way; to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0030600600:11"/>
deſire him to examine, while I am miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him; to throw duſt in his eyes, and
bid him ſee: then undoubtedly much might
be done. But theſe are arts I neither need
nor practiſe. I content my ſelf with the
plain honeſt way of giving my Reader the
beſt light I can, neither miſleading him my
ſelf, nor ſuffering him to be miſled by others.
With this view it is that I divide my reply
into the ſame number of ſections with your
defenſe, and confine my ſections to the ſame
matter with yours. This will indeed make
what I have to ſay ſomewhat leſs methodical,
but then it will enable the Reader more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
to compare us together, and to make a
more certain deciſion between us.</p>
               <p>The taking this method, Sir, will make it
plainly appear, that what I aim at is only
manifeſting the truth; and conſequently that
the reaſon of my courage in encountering
you, is my being verily perſuaded that I have
truth and juſtice on my ſide. I know and am
aware of your ſuperior accompliſhments:
But <hi>Philalethes</hi> is my name: And truth will
prevail againſt the pens of men or angels.

               <p>XVII. You begin this ſection with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
your ſelf to me in the following
manner. "I have ſaid (and I venture ſtill to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0030600600:22"/>
ſay) that a fluxion is incomprehenſible:
That ſecond, third and fourth fluxions
are yet more incomprehenſible: That it is
not poſſible to conceive a ſimple infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimal:
That it is yet leſs poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an infiniteſimal of an infiniteſimal,
and ſo onward. What have you to ſay to
this?" Truly very little. Only I don't
well comprehend, how one incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
can be MORE incomprehenſible than
another incomprehenſible: How it can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be LESS poſſible to conceive one thing
than to conceive another thing, which other
thing it is not at all poſſible to conceive.</p>
               <p>For clearing up theſe aſſertions I have had
recourſe, purſuant to your directions, to the
fourth ſection of the Analyſt, which is the
only one relating to fluxions, of the three
you refer me to. But all the ſatisfaction I
there meet with is, That <hi>your imagination is
very much ſtrained and puzzled</hi> with one
thing; That <hi>it ſeems ſtill more difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
another thing; That a third <hi>ſeems an
obſcure myſtery</hi>; That a fourth <hi>exceeds, if you
miſtake not, all human underſtanding</hi>; That
<hi>take</hi> another <hi>in what light one pleaſes, the
clear conception of it will, if you miſtake not,
be found impoſſible.</hi> This to me ſeems to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0030600600:23"/>
amount to thus much. The Author of the
<hi>Minute Philoſopher</hi> cannot comprehend the
principles of fluxions: Therefore no man
living can comprehend them. He cannot
underſtand them: Therefore they exceed
all human underſtanding. A notable proof
of my Hypotheſis, that that Gentleman has
too good an opinion of himſelf, and too
mean a one of all other men.</p>
               <p>You go on addreſſing your ſelf to me;
<hi>Do you attempt to clear up the notion of a
fluxion? Nothing like it.</hi> Very true, nor did
I ever undertake it. Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> has
done it incomparably well to thoſe who are
qualified to read his Works, and thither I
refer you. May not I expoſe your blunders,
without pretending to explain his doctrine
better than he has done it himſelf?</p>
               <p>But you tell me, <hi>I only aſſure you (upon my
bare word) from my own experience, and that
of ſeveral others whom I could name, that the
doctrine of fluxions may be clearly conceived and
diſtinctly comprehended.</hi> Why pray, Sir, what
did you require more? <hi>You appealed to the
trial of every thinking reader.</hi> I am one of
your <hi>thinking readers.</hi> I have made the <hi>trial</hi>
you deſired. I acquaint you with the reſult
of that <hi>trial,</hi> and all the return you make
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0030600600:24"/>
me is, <hi>Can you think I will take your word
when I refuſe to take your Maſter's?</hi> I appeal
to all my thinking readers whether this be
civil uſage. You ſay, you don't underſtand
fluxions. I ſay I do. I believe you: And
yet you won't believe me.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, my judgment tells me is all the
anſwer I ought to make to the invitations you
ſo frequently give me upon this head. I am
ſenſible it were better to hold ſo ſlippery an
adverſary to the points we have already in
hand, than before theſe are ſettled, to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
new matter. Beſides, I am afraid of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the common fate of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s
interpreters, to be leſs intelligible than my
Maſter. I apprehend likewiſe that, let me
take ever ſo much pains to ſatisfy and oblige
you, I ſhall meet with no better uſage than
when you appealed to me: That all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
I am to expect is, <hi>Alas! I find no ſenſe
or reaſon in what you ſay.</hi> And yet I am ſo
deſirous of contributing my aſſiſtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your laudable deſign of <hi>putting this
controverſy in ſuch a light as that every reader
may judge thereof,</hi> that I think I muſt run
that hazard. But I deſire it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

the point <hi>C,</hi> at that very inſtant of time an
increment begins to be generated, or begins
to exiſt, which therefore is properly called a
naſcent increment. And as the generating
point at that inſtant of time is ſuppoſed to be
juſt ſetting out, and not as yet to have moved
to the leaſt imaginable diſtance from the
point <hi>C,</hi> nor conſequently to have generated
the leaſt imaginable increment, it is plain that

be leſs than any quantity that can be aſſigned.</p>
                                 <p>In like manner when the generating point

of Fluxions! I am much miſtaken if
a little attention do not enable thee clearly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0030600600:29"/>
to conceive them. When thou haſt done
this, then wilt thou be rightly prepared for
underſtanding the following fundamental
propoſition, upon which Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>
has eſtabliſhed his Method of Fluxions: the
whole buſineſs of which Method is, from
the proportion between the Fluxions, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the naſcent increments, of flowing
quantities, to determine the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the flowing quantities themſelves;
<hi>&amp; vice verſa.</hi>

                              <p>The Fluxions, or Velocities, of flowing
quantities are very nearly as the increments
of thoſe flowing quantities, generated in very
ſmall equal particles of time: And they are
exactly in the firſt proportion of the naſcent
increments, or in the laſt proportion of the
evaneſcent increments.</p>

                           <div type="demonstration">

                              <p n="1">1. If the velocities are uniform, it is
plain that the increments generated in any
equal times muſt be as thoſe velocities.</p>
                              <p n="2">
                                 <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0030600600:30"/>
2. And if the velocities are not uniform,
but are perpetually changing, yet in a very
ſmall particle of time their change will be
very little, and the increments will be very
nearly the ſame as if the velocities were
uniform, <hi>i. e.</hi> the increments will be very
nearly as the velocities with which they begin
to be generated.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. And as the firſt ratio of the naſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
muſt be the ſame, whether the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities
be uniform or variable, it follows
that the naſcent increments muſt be exactly
as the velocities with which they begin to be
generated. <hi>Q. E. D.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Here, Sir, I muſt beg leave to obſerve to
you, that if Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> had proceeded
no farther than the firſt part of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and had contented himſelf with eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
the proportion between the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and their velocities very nearly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
going to the utmoſt exactneſs, yet his
Method had been no leſs ſcientifical and no
leſs demonſtrative than it now is. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
you were very much overſeen in
charging him and his followers with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
blindfold, and not knowing what
they were doing, even though you had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0030600600:31"/>
in proving that his Method did not
come up to the rigor of Geometry.</p>
                              <p>To prevent cavils, I muſt farther obſerve
that the third part of this demonſtration
might eaſily be put into a more diffuſive
form, and might be deduced ſtep by ſtep
from the <hi>Methodus rationum primarum &amp; ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timarum.</hi>
But this at preſent is no way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
eſpecially as you admit the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be true. All that I have to do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is to explain it a little more particularly,
and this I ſhall be the more careful in doing;
becauſe this proportion of naſcent or evane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
increments is what I apprehend, you
are ſo often pleaſed to call a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
nothings. With what juſtice you do
ſo the Reader may eaſily judge, if he gives
himſelf the trouble of conſidering what
follows.</p>
                              <p>In the firſt place, and above all, it is here
to be diligently attended to, that Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi> no where ſettles or determines the
magnitude of naſcent or evaneſcent incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
any farther than to ſay it is leſs than
any finite magnitude. On the contrary, he
expreſly declares that their magnitude can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be aſſigned or determined. Nor indeed
has he any occaſion to determine their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0030600600:32"/>
but only the proportion between
them, this being all that is requiſite in his
Method.</p>
                              <p>Now the proportion between two evane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
increments is eaſily to be conceived,
though the abſolute magnitude of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
is utterly imperceptible to the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
For thoſe increments may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
or repreſented by any two finite
quantities bearing the ſame proportion to
one another: And as theſe finite quantities
may be clearly conceived, the proportion
between them may likewiſe be clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the proportion of the evane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
increments may be clearly conceived
by this means. Of this ſeveral examples
may be found in Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s <hi>Methodus ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
primarum &amp; ultimarum,</hi> and one in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of him may be ſeen in this Letter, Sect.
XXXII.</p>
                              <p>This being premiſed, I come now to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
and explain the Propoſition, to
which end I ſhall make uſe of the following
eaſy example.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0030600600:33"/>
                                 <figure/>
Let the right

line <hi>AbB,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into two
equal parts in
the point <hi>b,</hi>
revolve about
the point <hi>A,</hi> and with any continued motion,
even or uneven, remove into the ſituation
<hi>AcC.</hi> Then will the points <hi>B</hi> and <hi>b</hi> deſcribe
the circular arcs <hi>BC, bc:</hi> The velocity of
the point <hi>B</hi> will be always double of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the point <hi>b:</hi> The arc <hi>BC</hi> will be
double of the arc <hi>bc:</hi> And the increment
<hi>BD</hi> will be double of the increment <hi>bd.</hi>
In all this there is no difficulty between us.</p>
                              <p>I ſay farther, The naſcent or evaneſcent
increment of the arc <hi>BC</hi> is double of the
naſcent or evaneſcent increment of the arc
<hi>bc.</hi> This you won't underſtand. I explain
it thus, beginning firſt with the naſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
                              <p>As ſoon as the line <hi>AbB</hi> begins to revolve
upon the point <hi>A,</hi> and thereby begins to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the ſituation <hi>AbB</hi>; at that inſtant
of time do the points <hi>B</hi> and <hi>b</hi> begin to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
their ſeveral increments. And as the
velocity of the point <hi>B</hi> is always double of
the velocity of the point <hi>b,</hi> it is manifeſt that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0030600600:34"/>
the increment of the arc <hi>BC</hi> begins to be
generated with twice the velocity that the
increment of the arc <hi>bc</hi> begins to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with; <hi>i.e.</hi> that the naſcent increment
of <hi>BC</hi> is generated with twice the velocity
that the naſcent increment of <hi>bc</hi> is generated
with; and conſequently that the former
naſcent increment is by this propoſition
double of the latter naſcent increment.</p>
                              <p>To come now to the evaneſcent incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
let us ſuppoſe the line <hi>AbB</hi> to have
removed into the ſituation <hi>AdD</hi> very near
to <hi>AbB,</hi> whereby the increments <hi>BD, bd</hi>
have been generated. Next let us imagine
the line <hi>AbD</hi> to return gradually to its firſt
ſituation <hi>AbB,</hi> and thereby let the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>BD, bd</hi> grow continually leſs and
leſs, and at laſt entirely vaniſh and become
nothing. Then as the firſt of theſe two incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is double of the ſecond, and decreaſes
twice as faſt as the ſecond, it muſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
bear the ſame proportion to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
and conſequently the laſt proportion
of theſe two increments, their proportion at
the inſtant of evaneſcence will be the ſame as
at firſt, namely that of 2 to 1. You tell
me, when they vaniſh, they become nothing.
I allow it. You ſay, to talk of a proportion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0030600600:35"/>
between nothings is to talk nonſenſe. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with you. But their laſt proportion is
not their proportion after they are vaniſhed
and are become nothing: It is their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when they vaniſh: It is the proportion
with which they vaniſh.</p>
                              <p>You will tell me, perhaps, this is unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.
I expect it. I ask you therefore,
which vaniſhes firſt? The increments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
Or the proportion between them?
I think, Sir, even you will not venture to ſay,
that the increments vaniſh before their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
vaniſhes; or that the proportion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
before the increments vaniſh. If ſo;
we are agreed thus far, that the increments
vaniſh and their proportion vaniſhes at one
and the ſame inſtant of time. This propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therefore which vaniſhes at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of time that the increments vaniſh, is
the proportion with which the increments
vaniſh, or, in other words, is the laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the evaneſcent increments.</p>
                              <p>This, I hope, will appear ſufficiently
clear to an attentive Reader: But for his
farther ſatisfaction I ſhall beg leave to lay
before him another example.</p>
                              <p>Let the point <hi>A</hi> with a given uniform ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
deſcribe or generate the flowing line <figure>
                                    <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0030600600:36"/>
                                 </figure>
                                 <hi>AB:</hi> And let the point <hi>D</hi> with a velocity
continually increaſing deſcribe or generate
the flowing line <hi>DE:</hi> Alſo let both points
arrive at the line <hi>CF,</hi> (cutting the two flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lines) at the ſame inſtant of time, and
with velocities exactly equal.</p>
                              <p>Then it is plain, that if we take two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
<hi>Ff, Cc,</hi> generated in the ſame
particle of time, <hi>Ff</hi> will a little exceed <hi>Cc.</hi>
But if we ſuppoſe the generating points to
return towards the line <hi>CF,</hi> and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
velocities in every point of the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>Ff, Cc,</hi> to be the very ſame in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
as they had been before in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the line <hi>CF</hi>; it is manifeſt that the
more the increments are diminiſhed by the
gradual return of the generating points to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the line <hi>CF,</hi> the nearer will the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between them approach to that of a
perfect equality. This is eaſily conceived,
and admits of no diſpute.</p>
                              <p>Farther, if the generating points be ſuppoſed
to return exactly to the line <hi>CF,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0030600600:37"/>
by the increments vaniſh and become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
the ratio with which the increments
vaniſh into nothing, or the laſt proportion
of the evaneſcent increments, will be that of
a perfect equality. For, as during the time
that the generating points are returning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the line <hi>CF,</hi> the increments <hi>Ff, Cc</hi>
are continually more and more diminiſhed,
and the velocities with which the increments
decreaſe, approach more and more to the
ratio of equality; ſo at the inſtant of time
that thoſe points actually arrive at the line
<hi>CF,</hi> at that ſame inſtant the increments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
vaniſh, and at the very ſame inſtant
the velocities with which they decreaſe
and in decreaſing vaniſh, arrive at the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
of perfect equality: which therefore is
the ratio of the velocities with which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
vaniſh, and conſequently, by this
propoſition, is the ratio of the evaneſcent
increments.</p>
                              <p>It is to be carefully attended to, that the
proportion here given as the proportion of
the evaneſcent increments, is not their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
before they vaniſh. For then <hi>Ff</hi>
will exceed <hi>Cc.</hi> Nor is it their proportion
after they have vaniſhed. For then they are
become nothing and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                                    <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0030600600:38"/>
But it is their proportion at the inſtant that
they vaniſh, or the proportion with which
they vaniſh.</p>
                              <p>I might obſerve farther, that as the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
do not come to this proportion before
they vaniſh, ſo neither do they vaniſh before
they come to this proportion: but at one and
the ſame inſtant of time they come to this
proportion and vaniſh, they vaniſh and come
to this proportion. But I am now afraid I
have taken up too much of my reader's

at large; becauſe with another pious
art you have thought fit to truncate the one,
and to leave out the other, for particular
reaſons which I ſhall by and by lay before
the reader. Where, ſaid I, do you find
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> uſing ſuch expreſſions as
<hi>the velocities of the velocities, the ſecond,
third and fourth velocities, the incipient ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity

               <p>To theſe two Queſtions you are ſenſible
it is incumbent upon you to ſeem to give an
anſwer, and you are likewiſe ſenſible you
have none to give. In this <hi>perplexity</hi> it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place you curtail my firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
cutting off the latter part of it with an

one of your definitions, and that the leaſt

                  <hi>celerity of an incipient celerity.</hi> There's one
difficulty cleverly got over.</p>
               <p>In the next place you entirely cut off my
ſecond queſtion. In which I find you have
two advantages. The firſt is to avoid giving
an anſwer to it. The ſecond, not to let your
reader ſee Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s definition,
which I had inſerted into that queſtion.</p>
               <p>But ſetting all this aſide, after you have
propoſed my queſtion in your own manner,
what anſwer do you give to it? Do you
ſhew me where Sir <hi>I. N.</hi> uſes ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
No. You don't pretend to it. What
then? Why truly you endeavour to ſhew,
by comparing together two independent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
taken from two different treatiſes of
Sir <hi>I. N.</hi> that you may juſtifiably call a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

think otherwiſe. Yet ſtill this will only
ſhew that a definition of your own may be
uſed; but will not ſhew it to be Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi>'s definition, nor to be equally clear
with Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s definition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>pious art</hi> I at firſt mentioned, ſtill
ſubſiſts with the addition of two or three

the matter in debate, as well as to complete
what I had begun in my ſeventeenth ſection
towards clearing up the firſt principles of

ſecond, but of third, fourth and fifth fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

               <p>That great Man making uſe of the liberty
which has always been allowed to Inventors,
of giving new names to new conceptions,
and of defining thoſe names as they thought
fit, has been pleaſed to call by the name of
fluxion, the velocity with which a flowing
quantity increaſes or decreaſes. If this velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
do not always continue the ſame, but
undergo any change, the velocity of that
change is called a fluxion of a fluxion, or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
fluxion; and as the change is ſwifter or
ſlower, the ſecond fluxion is ſaid to be greater
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0030600600:45"/>
or leſs. For inſtance, if the firſt fluxion or
velocity of the flowing quantity continually
increaſe, the ſecond fluxion is the velocity
with which the firſt velocity increaſes, and
is proportional to the momentaneous increaſe
of that firſt velocity.</p>
               <p>In like manner the third fluxion is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the change of the ſecond fluxion;
the fourth fluxion is the velocity of the
change of the third; the fifth the velocity

               <p>Here perhaps it may not be amiſs to aſſiſt
the reader's imagination by repreſenting the
proportions betwen fluxions of all the ſeveral
orders in a ſenſible manner. I ſay their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions:
for, as I ſaid before, Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi> makes no enquiry into, nor ever
conſiders the abſolute magnitude of fluxions,
or moments, or naſcent increments, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the proportion between them. And this
I deſire may be carefully remembred.</p>

to have met with a greater inſtance of
diſtingenuity and wilful miſrepreſentation in
any controverſy I have ever looked into,
than what the reader will obſerve to run
through theſe three ſections. You had in the
Analyſt charged the Mathematicians with
unjuſtly omitting a certain rectangle in their
computation of the increment of the rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of two flowing quantities, and thereupon
had thought fit to repreſent them as <hi>not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

means,</hi> with abundance of the like compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
plentifully diſperſed all over the
Analyſt.</p>
               <p>To this I had replied, Firſt, that this
omiſſion, at the worſt, could not cauſe them
to deviate from the truth the leaſt imaginable
quantity, in computing the moſt immenſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0030600600:49"/>
magnitude: Secondly, that as they clearly
ſaw and could plainly demonſtrate this inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy
of the omiſſion, they could not
juſtly be ſaid to proceed blindfold: Thirdly,
that this pretended error or omiſſion of theirs
was only a blunder of your own.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, you ſpend three ſections
in endeavouring to make your reader believe,
that the main ſtreſs of my defence of Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> and his followers is, That this
error of theirs is <hi>of no ſignificancy in practice</hi>;
without taking the leaſt notice of the ſecond
part of my reply, and barely mentioning the

I grant it is not. Why then have I ſaid ſo
much about the ſmallneſs of the error? I
will even tell you the plain truth. Though,
as you take notice, I <hi>live in the univerſity,</hi>
yet I have been in <hi>London</hi> too, and <hi>am</hi> a little

curious to know what this diſcovery was,
that was like to do ſo much ſervice to the

and apply the old ſaying, <hi>Parturiunt montes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of them indeed could make nothing
of what I had ſaid about the length of a
ſubtangent, or the magnitude of the orb of

the information given him by one of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

               <p>XXVII. Now, gentle Reader, we come
to the point. You are to be ſhown the firſt
inſtance of <hi>my courage in affirming with ſuch
undoubting aſſurance things ſo eaſily diſproved.</hi>
My antagoniſt <hi>intreats you to obſerve how
fairly I proceed.</hi> I deſire you to be upon
your guard, to look well about you. After
this, if either of us endeavour to throw duſt
in your eyes, knock him down: Which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
of us ſhall attempt to falſify the
words of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> or thoſe of his
opponent, to the Pump, to the <hi>Thames,</hi>
to the <hi>Liffy</hi> with him, pump him, duck
him for a Pickpocket. The diſpute here is
about a matter of fact, and I will endeavour
to ſtate the caſe ſo plainly, that it ſhall be
impoſſible either to miſtake or to evade it.</p>
               <p>In Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s demonſtration of
the rule for finding the moment of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctangle
of two flowing quantities, mention
is made of three ſeveral rectangles, to each
of which the flowing rectangle is equal, at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0030600600:52"/>
three different times, or in three different
ſtates.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is the rectangle
<hi>A</hi>−½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−½<hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is the rectangle <hi>AB.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is the rectangle <hi>A</hi>+½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>+½<hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had obſerved, Sir, that you were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in taking it for granted, that what
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> was endeavouring to find
by the ſuppoſitions made in this demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was the increment of the ſecond of
theſe rectangles, the rectangle <hi>AB.</hi> The
reaſon I gave for ſuppoſing you in a miſtake,
was expreſſed in the following words. "For
neither in the demonſtration it ſelf, nor
in any thing preceding or following it,
is any mention ſo much as once made of
the increment of the rectangle <hi>AB.</hi>" This
therefore is a matter of fact that you diſpute
with me: But how you diſpute it, is worth
obſerving. It greatly imports you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
me, and yet you cannot, you dare
not contradict what I ſay. Notwithſtanding
this you will contradict me. Methinks I ſee
my reader ſtare. I ſhall be taken for a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
And yet I ſpeak the words of truth
and ſoberneſs. <hi>I affirm,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the direct
contrary.</hi> Contrary to what? To what I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0030600600:53"/>
have ſaid? No. You cannot, you dare not
do it. Your reader would immediately turn
to Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> and detect you. But you
can firſt alter what I ſay, and then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
me. Inſtead of my words alone, you can
give the reader other words which are not
mine, and yet are ſo intermixed with mine
and diſtinguiſhed by inverted comma's, that
every reader ſhall take them for mine; and
then you can <hi>affirm the direct contrary.</hi> You
cannot ſay Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> makes mention
of the increment of the rectangle <hi>AB:</hi> But
you can affirm that he makes mention of the
rectangle <hi>of ſuch flowing quantities:</hi> That he
makes expreſs mention of the increment of
<hi>ſuch rectangle:</hi> Of the increment of <hi>that
rectangle whoſe ſides have</hi> a <hi>and</hi> b <hi>for their
incrementa tota:</hi> That he underſtands his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementum</hi>
as belonging to the <hi>rectangulum
quodvis.</hi> You go on declaiming about <hi>the
words, the ſenſe, the context, the concluſion
of the demonſtration</hi> and <hi>the thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated:</hi>

I refer it to him likewiſe, and reply to
all you have here ſaid, that the firſt of the
three rectangles mentioned above, namely
the rectangle <hi>A</hi>−½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−½<hi>b</hi> is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctangle
of two flowing quantities, but is
not the rectangle <hi>AB</hi>; is a rectangle whoſe

but is not the rectangle <hi>AB</hi>; is the <hi>rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulum
quodvis</hi> in its firſt ſtate, but ſtill is not
the rectangle <hi>AB.</hi> The queſtion is, as
your ſelf declare, about <hi>matter of fact.</hi> It
is not therefore about what Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
means, but what he mentions: Not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
what he underſtands, but what he
declares: Not about his ſenſe, but his

this demonſtration and every thing prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

he does not ſo much as once mention the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement

this plain caſe by diſtinguiſhing between an</hi>

                  <hi>increment and a moment. But it is evident
to every one, who has any notion of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the</hi> incrementum <hi>in the concluſion
muſt be the</hi> momentum <hi>in the Lemma; and
to ſuppoſe it otherwiſe is no credit to the Author.</hi>
Now, Sir, to ſhew you how little I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to <hi>perplex the caſe,</hi> I hereby declare
that I abſolutely and fully agree with you
that the <hi>incrementum</hi> in the concluſion is the
<hi>momentum</hi> in the Lemma. Let us now ſee
whither this our agreement will lead us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>momentum</hi> in the Lemma we both
agree to be the <hi>momentum</hi> of the rectangle
<hi>AB.</hi> The <hi>incrementum</hi> in the concluſion
is manifeſtly the exceſs of the rectangle
<hi>A</hi>+½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>+½<hi>b,</hi> above the rectangle
<hi>A</hi>−½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−½<hi>b,</hi> i.e. the increment of the
rectangle <hi>A</hi>−½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−½<hi>b.</hi> Therefore we
are agreed that the moment of the rectangle
<hi>AB</hi> is the increment of the rectangle
<hi>A</hi>−½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−½<hi>b.</hi> Conſequently you were
miſtaken in ſuppoſing that the moment of
the rectangle <hi>AB</hi> was the increment of the
ſame rectangle <hi>AB.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You quote Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me to ſhew that a moment is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
or decrement. Why Sir! You
make me ſtare. Did not I plainly tell you
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0030600600:56"/>
in my defence that the moment of <hi>AB</hi>
was an increment? Did not I likewiſe tell
you what increment it was, namely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of <hi>A</hi>−½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−½<hi>b</hi>? If you will
be pleaſed to put on your mathematical
ſpectacles, or rather to put on the ingenuity
of a Scholar and a Gentleman, (for your
eyes are good enough) you will plainly ſee
that the diſtinction I make, is not between a
moment in general and an increment in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but between a particular moment and
a particular increment, between the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the rectangle <hi>AB</hi> and the increment
of the rectangle <hi>AB,</hi> i.e. the exceſs of the
rectangle <hi>A</hi>+<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>+<hi>b</hi> above the rectangle
<hi>AB.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve me well, Sir, what I have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and what I ſtill affirm, and what before
I have done, I ſhall prove paſt a poſſibility
of being denied, is this. The moment of
<hi>AB</hi> is neither the increment nor the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>AB</hi>; neither the exceſs of <hi>A</hi>+<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>+<hi>b</hi> above <hi>AB</hi>; nor the defect of <hi>A</hi>−<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−<hi>b</hi> from <hi>AB.</hi> This ſeems to you <hi>a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi>
aſſertion. But one of yours, which
you call a <hi>very plain and eaſy</hi> one, is to me
much more wonderful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0030600600:57"/>
I aſked, which of theſe two quantities,
the increment of <hi>AB,</hi> or the decrement of
<hi>AB,</hi> you would be pleaſed to call the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>AB</hi>? Your anſwer is, <hi>Either of
them.</hi> This to me is a very wonderful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for ſo great and ſo accurate a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician
to make, and if I have not quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
my Logick, I ſhall draw as wonderful
an inference from it. The moment of <hi>AB</hi>
is equal to the increment of <hi>AB:</hi> The ſame
moment of <hi>AB</hi> is equal to the decrement
of <hi>AB. Ergo,</hi> the increment of <hi>AB</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the decrement of <hi>AB.</hi> That is,
<hi>Ab</hi>+<hi>Ba</hi>+<hi>ab</hi>=<hi>Ab</hi>+<hi>Ba</hi>−<hi>ab,</hi> i.e.
2<hi>ab</hi>=<hi>o.</hi> Therefore the rectangle <hi>ab,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which the Author of the Minute Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
has made ſuch a pother, is by his
own confeſſion equal to nothing.</p>
               <p>Your example in numbers does by no
means come up to our caſe. I ſhall beg leave
to ſtate it a little more pertinently. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that all numbers are either odd, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Upon this you pronounce an unknown
number to be even, without giving any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it. I repreſent to you that, ſince the
number is unknown, it may as well be odd
as even; and therefore to pronounce it either
the one or the other, without any reaſon for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0030600600:58"/>
ſo doing, is no better, and no more like an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetician,
than to toſs up croſs or pile
what you ſhall call it. You may call this
mirth, if you pleaſe; but the argument is
not the leſs ſtrong againſt you for this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
levity.</p>
               <p>Nor is the accommodation I propoſed in
the diſpute between an increment and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
for the title of moment, at all the
leſs reaſonable for being delivered in a ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous
manner, under which other perſons
can plainly diſcern a ſerious argument, and I
perceive you find it much eaſier to rally than
to anſwer that argument. To ſay truth,
there is no anſwer to be given to it; it is a
demonſtration againſt you as ſtrong as any in
<hi>Euclid,</hi> that the moment of the rectangle
<hi>AB</hi> is a middle arithmetical proportional
between the increment and decrement of the
ſame rectangle <hi>AB.</hi> If ſo;</p>

by this you are duly ſenſible of my candour.

a fair occaſion of repreſenting another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>The queſtion with me was, Whether the

the velocity with which the increment, or
the velocity with which the decrement, of

I could ſee no poſſibility of a reaſon to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
me either way. This led me to fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a middle arithmetical proportional be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

of the rectangle <hi>AB:</hi> As I had before ſhewn

may be deemed equal to a third velocity;
or two velocities may be deemed equal and

                  <hi>no velocity at all.</hi> Nor I neither. But in
the rectangle <hi>AB</hi> conſidered as flowing,
whether increaſing or diminiſhing, I can
conceive ſome velocity or other: And if it
flow with an accelerated velocity; I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that velocity to be different in every

equal particle of time; I can conceive
the uniform velocity that would generate the
increment in the given time, to exceed the
uniform velocity that would generate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
in the ſame time: And theſe two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities
being unequal, I can conceive an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical

manner as I had before ſuppoſed an arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
mean between the increment and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

me there appears no more difficulty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

finite quantity is divided or diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
halves. For naſcent quantities may bear
all imaginable proportions to one another, as
well as finite quantities. One example of this
I have already given in ſect. 17. p. 27. where
the naſcent increments <hi>BD, bd,</hi> bear to
each other the proportion of 2 to 1; and
conſequently the naſcent increment <hi>bd</hi> is
equal to one half of the naſcent increment
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0030600600:64"/>
                  <hi>BD.</hi> And by dividing the revolving line

very eaſy to conceive what number one

               <p>It is poſſible you may be ſo exceedingly
ſcrupulous as to object that, though a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as <hi>bd,</hi> is here ſhewn to be equal to
half of another moment <hi>BD,</hi> yet ſtill this
does not come up to the caſe of Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton's</hi> demonſtration, where one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſuppoſed not only to be double of
another, as in this caſe, but to be actually
divided into two equal parts. I am willing
to have all poſſible regard for the tenderneſs
and delicacy of your underſtanding in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any thing that makes againſt you,
and therefore ſhall readily you give the beſt

of time ſet out from <hi>B</hi> with one half of the
former velocity, to deſcribe the line <hi>BC.</hi>
Then will this ſecond point arrive at <hi>C</hi> in
the ſame given time as the firſt point will
arrive there. Now let us ſuppoſe the lines
<hi>AC, BC,</hi> to be gradually deſtroyed by this
motion of their reſpective deſcribing points
<hi>A</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> It is manifeſt that theſe lines will
be to one another as 2 to 1, not only at the
firſt, but all the time they are diminiſhing.
And as by the approach of the points <hi>A</hi> and
<hi>B</hi> to the point <hi>C</hi> theſe lines will be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<hi>ſine fine,</hi> and will at laſt vaniſh into
nothing by the actual arrival of thoſe points
at <hi>C</hi>; the proportion beforeſaid of 2 to 1
will ſtill ſubſiſt between them to the inſtant
of their evaneſcence, and even at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.
Here then we have the evaneſcent
line <hi>AB</hi> actually divided into two equal
parts, as was above propoſed. For this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
does not ceaſe before the line vaniſhes,
any more than the line vaniſhes before the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0030600600:66"/>
diviſion ceaſes. The whole line <hi>AC</hi> does
not vaniſh before its half <hi>BC</hi>; nor the half
<hi>BC</hi> before the whole <hi>AC:</hi> But the whole
line <hi>AC</hi> and the half line <hi>BC</hi> vaniſh at one
and the ſame inſtant of time.</p>
               <p>I am ſatisfied that what I have here laid
before you, in order to aſſiſt you in conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an evaneſcent quantity diſtinguiſhed into
two equal parts, will be of little uſe, unleſs
I clear up the reſt of thoſe <hi>ſtrange conceits,
if words without a meaning may be called ſo,
which,</hi> you ſay, <hi>I utter with that extreme
ſatisfaction and complacency,</hi> that <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
account, in which you find no ſenſe or
reaſon, and bid the reader find it if he can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here, I own, you have fairly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
me. I am at a ſtand, at a loſs, in as
great a perplexity, as when my hunger was
equally divided between the two bottles of
hay, without ſeeing any poſſibility of its
being ſatisfied. Oh for a whiſper from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ghoſt! But alas! What would even
that avail me againſt a Freethinker in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
againſt a man ſo hardened in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
that he will not believe, though
one ſhould ariſe from the dead, not upon
<hi>the word of a Ghoſt, how venerable ſoever</hi>?
What then can be done? I had, I thought,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0030600600:67"/>
rendered that account as clear as words
could make it. I had ſhown not only what
a moment was, but to prevent, as far as
poſſible, all miſtakes about it, I had moſt
carefully and circumſpectly ſhown what it
was not. Since that account was publiſhed,
I had obſerved ſeveral perſons to be greatly
ſatisfied with that paragraph, and ſome to
have rectified their notions by it. What
then can be the reaſon of this <hi>phaenomenon,</hi>
that the perſpicacious Author of the Minute
Philoſopher cannot comprehend what every
body elſe ſo eaſily underſtands, cannot ſee
what to others appears as clear as the day?
Is it that he has hurt his ſight by poring ſo
long upon objects too ſmall to be diſcerned,
as <hi>a triangle in a point</hi>? Or has he blinded
himſelf by gazing upon a light too ſtrong
for his eyes, with endeavouring to find ſpots
in the Sun? Or has he crack'd his brain by
his meditations upon a ſcience too hard for
an <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eſſay on Viſion. Sect. CLIII to CLIX.</note> Angel? Hark! Is not that he, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming

But hold! Theſe circumſtances ſurely
can never ſuit my correſpondent; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
I remember, he abominates the very
ſound of <hi>Miltonick</hi> verſe. I muſt certainly
be miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Is it then, that by having been long in
the dark, and fixing his attention upon dim
and obſcure objects which he had not light
enough to perceive diſtinctly, his pupil is
ſo dilated as not to be able to diſtinguiſh
things in open day? I was going to ſay,
like a Cat that had loſt her <hi>Membrana nicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
But perhaps this compariſon, though
with ſo ſagacious an Animal, may give
him offence. What then ſhall I ſay? I have
it. I beg his pardon for theſe offenſive gueſſes.
It was my own fault I was not underſtood
by him. This comes of ſaving ſixpence to
one's reader. Had I put a figure in that
place, all had been right. But I was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have none. For, I knew, my Book-ſeller,
who underſtands his buſineſs as well
as <hi>Jacob Tonſon,</hi> would not have failed of
clapping on the other ſixpence to the price
of my performance, which would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
me in my deſign of making Truth
come cheaper than error. But it will be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0030600600:70"/>
asked, why the want of a figure to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſhould be of greater diſadvantage to
him than to other readers. I anſwer, this
proceeds from an infirmity that I have long
obſerved in him, though every body may
not have taken notice of it, and though it
is, as I believe, unknown to himſelf. It is,
that his Ideas are almoſt all ſenſible. He has
few or none of thoſe Ideas which are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or partly, intellectual, and which have no
ſenſible images to repreſent them. But of
this diſeaſe I may perhaps ſpeak more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
another time; at preſent I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to obviate this defect in him by the
following figure.

               <p>Let therefore <hi>RALB,</hi> or <hi>RL,</hi> repreſent

<hi>eRbq, iRcr, oRdſ, uRft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then will the rectangle <hi>A</hi>−½<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−½<hi>b</hi>
be repreſented by the rectangle <hi>Rr</hi>; the

               <p>Likewiſe the rectangle <hi>A</hi>+<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>+<hi>b</hi>
will be repreſented by <hi>Rt</hi>; and the difference
between this rectangle and the rectangle
<hi>AB,</hi> or the increment of <hi>AB,</hi> will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by the gnomon <hi>Lt</hi> lying without
the rectangle <hi>RL.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now ſee if by the help of this
figure my <hi>unintelligible account</hi> of a moment
can be cleared up.

                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then, the moment of the rectangle
<hi>AB,</hi> or <hi>RL,</hi> is neither the increment from
<hi>AB</hi> to <hi>A</hi>+<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>+<hi>b</hi>; nor the decrement

<hi>Lt</hi> nor <hi>Lq.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not a moment common to <hi>AB</hi> and
<hi>A</hi>+<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>+<hi>b,</hi> which may be conſidered as
the increment of the former, or as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement

common to <hi>RL</hi> and <hi>Rt,</hi> which may be

the decrement of <hi>Rt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it a moment common to <hi>AB</hi> and
<hi>A</hi>−<hi>a</hi> × <hi>B</hi>−<hi>b,</hi> which may be conſidered as

of <hi>Rq.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is the moment of the very indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual

that only; and ſuch as being conſidered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
either as an increment or decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhall be exactly and perfectly the

peculiar only to <hi>RL</hi>; and if <hi>RL</hi> be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as an increaſing quantity, <hi>rſ</hi>; may be
conſidered as an increment; if <hi>RL</hi> be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

as a decrement. But whether <hi>rſ</hi>; be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

is one and the ſame quantity.</p>
               <p>And the way to obtain ſuch a moment,

               </p>
               <p>I hope, by this time, Sir, you may have
diſcovered ſome <hi>ſenſe and reaſon in what I ſay</hi>
in my account of a moment: but if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
or will not diſcover any, I flatter myſelf
the reader both will and can. And having
now a figure before me, I ſhall take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0030600600:75"/>
of ſhewing you, that there is ſome
<hi>reaſoning</hi> couched under what you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to take for <hi>mirth and humour,</hi> in
the proof that I have given, <hi>pag.</hi> 45, 46.
of my Defence, that the moment of the rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
<hi>AB</hi> is not the increment or decrement
of <hi>AB,</hi> but a middle arithmetical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
between them.</p>
               <p>After propoſing to you what by your own
confeſſion is the increment, and what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of the rectangle <hi>AB,</hi> I aſk, you
ſay, <hi>with an intention to puzzle you,</hi> which
of theſe you will call the moment of <hi>AB.</hi>
I ſuppoſed it impoſſible for you to give any
anſwer to that queſtion, and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
it my own way. You now ſay, <hi>Either
of them:</hi> And you call this a <hi>plain and eaſy
anſwer.</hi> My queſtion was, What is the
moment of the rectangle <hi>RL</hi>? You anſwer,
<hi>EITHER Lt,</hi> or <hi>Lq.</hi> I aſk again, How
can I take EITHER <hi>Lt,</hi> or <hi>Lq,</hi> for the
moment of <hi>RL,</hi> when <hi>Lt</hi> and <hi>Lq</hi> are une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual?
If the moment be equal to <hi>Lt,</hi> then
muſt <hi>Lq</hi> be leſs than the moment: And if
the moment be equal to <hi>Lq,</hi> then muſt <hi>Lt</hi>
be greater than the moment. Which then
muſt I take for the moment, ſince each of
them can never be equal to the moment?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0030600600:76"/>
All the Anſwer I can get out of you is, <hi>EI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER
of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Things ſtanding thus, I offer this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to your conſideration. Since, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you, I may take <hi>Lt</hi> for the moment
of <hi>RL</hi>; and ſince, according to you I may
likewiſe take <hi>Lq</hi> for the moment of <hi>RL</hi>;
it is manifeſt that, according to you, I may
take <hi>Lt</hi> and <hi>Lq</hi> added together for twice
the moment of <hi>RL.</hi> Conſequently, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you, I may take the half of <hi>Lt</hi> and
the half of <hi>Lq</hi> added together for the
moment of <hi>RL,</hi> i.e. I may take <hi>rſ</hi>; for the
moment of <hi>RL.</hi> I hope I may now be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to ſay, "Believe me there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
you muſt acquieſce."</p>
               <q>—Fruſtra cerno te tendere contra.</q>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, Sir, you may now compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
my meaning, when I ſay, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>AB</hi> is not the increment of <hi>AB,</hi>
tho' I allow the moment of <hi>AB</hi> to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement,
agreeably to Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s
definition of the word moment. But ſtill it
is poſſible, you may doubt whether the ſenſe
I aſſign to the word moment, be Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi>'s ſenſe of that term, or a new one that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0030600600:77"/>
I have affixed to it in oppoſition to you.
This is the next point to be cleared up.</p>
               <p>And here I beg leave to obſerve in the firſt
place, the preſumption is ſtrong in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that by the moment of <hi>AB</hi> Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>
means ſomething different from the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>AB.</hi> For if theſe two words ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
preciſely the ſame thing, it is probable
he would have uſed them indifferently,
ſometimes the one and ſometimes the other.
Whereas the fact is, that, after he has done
with defining his terms, he never mentions
the word increment but in one place, and
then he does not ſpeak of the increment of
the rectangle <hi>AB,</hi> but only of the increment
of the rectangle, <hi>i.e.</hi> of the flowing rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
taken at large. But where he names his
rectangle, or other flowing quantity, as <hi>AB,</hi>
                  <hi>ABC, A2</hi>, <hi>A3</hi>, &amp;c. He never mentions
the increment of <hi>AB,</hi> of <hi>ABC,</hi> of <hi>A2</hi>, &amp;c.
but always the moment of <hi>AB,</hi> the moment
of <hi>ABC,</hi> the moment of <hi>A2</hi>, of <hi>A3</hi>, &amp;c.
And when ſuch a writer as Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>
chuſes conſtantly to uſe one term, rather than
another ſeemingly of the ſame ſignification,
it is to be preſmed he has ſome reaſon for
ſo doing.</p>
               <p>But farther, we are to take notice that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> the moment of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0030600600:78"/>
a flowing quantity is ever proportional to the
velocity of the ſame flowing quantity. Let
the velocity and the moment of a flowing
quantity vary as they will, yet if any inſtant
of time be taken, theſe three things will be
given, ſuch as they are at that ſame inſtant,
namely, the rectangle itſelf, its velocity, and
its moment. And this velocity and moment
are always proportional. If therefore it ſhall
be ſhown, that the moment of a flowing
quantity, ſuch as I ſuppoſe it, is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to the velocity of that ſame flowing quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
it will follow that what I ſuppoſe to
be the moment, is the ſame with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
intended by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order therefore to render the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this point as eaſy and as clear as
poſſible, I ſhall once more have recourſe to
that well known and familiar inſtance of a
flowing quantity I have ſo often made uſe of,
<hi>viz.</hi> that of a line deſcribed by the motion
of a point.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>x</hi> repreſent the time, in which a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
line is generated, in all the following
caſes, and ſince time flows uniformly, let
the conſtant quantity <hi>ẋ</hi> repreſent the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or increment, (for in this particular
caſe they are both one) of the time <hi>x.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0030600600:79"/>
Caſe 1. If the velocity of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
point be uniform, the flowing line will
be as the time in which it is generated, and
conſequently the line may alſo be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>x,</hi> and its moment or increment may
be repreſented by <hi>ẋ</hi> In this caſe therefore
the moment <hi>ẋ,</hi> being conſtant, muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
to the velocity, which is likewiſe
conſtant.</p>
               <p>Caſe 2. Let the velocity be equably acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
as in the caſe of a falling body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Galileo</hi>'s Theory. Then will the
velocity be as the time, and conſequently
the velocity likewiſe may be repreſented by
<hi>x.</hi> And the flowing line being as the time
and velocity jointly, that line may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by <hi>x2</hi>. Now the ſuppoſed moment
of this line <hi>x2</hi>, is 2<hi>xẋ,</hi> and I ſay, 2<hi>xẋ</hi> is
proportional to <hi>x</hi> the velocity of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
line. For ſince <hi>ẋ</hi> is a conſtant quantity,
it is evident that 2<hi>xẋ</hi> is as 2<hi>x</hi>; and 2<hi>x</hi> is
as <hi>x.</hi> Therefore 2<hi>xẋ</hi> is as <hi>x.</hi> In this caſe
therefore the ſuppoſed moment is as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the flowing quantity.</p>
               <p>Caſe 3. Let the velocity be as the ſquare
of the time, and be repreſented by <hi>x2</hi>. Then
will the flowing line ſtill be as the velocity
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0030600600:80"/>
and the time jointly, and conſequently may be
repreſented by <hi>x3</hi>, the ſuppoſed moment
of which, <hi>viz.</hi> 3<hi>x2</hi>
                  <hi>ẋ,</hi> is evidently as <hi>x2</hi>, or as
the velocity.</p>
               <p>Caſe 4. In general, let the velocity be as
any power of the time, and conſequently be
repreſented by <hi>x<hi>n</hi>−1</hi>. Then may the flowing
line be repreſented by the time and the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
jointly, or by <hi>x</hi> × <hi>x<hi>n</hi>−1</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi> by <hi>x</hi>^<hi>n.</hi> And
the ſuppoſed moment of this line will be
<hi>nx<hi>n</hi>−1</hi>
                  <hi>ẋ,</hi> which is manifeſtly as <hi>x<hi>n</hi>−1</hi>, that is,
as the velocity.</p>
               <p>The moment therefore ſuppoſed by me
is ever proportional to the velocity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
is the moment ſuppoſed by Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I am upon this conſideration, it
may not be amiſs for a more compleat illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of what we have been talking of,
to conſider a little more particularly the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
caſe, or that of the flowing quantity
<hi>x2</hi>, anſwering to the rectangle <hi>AB</hi> of Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi> I ſhall therefore take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of laying before my reader in one
view, the decrement, the moment, and the
increment of the flowing quantity <hi>x2</hi>, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the ſeveral velocities that would ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0030600600:81"/>
them reſpectively, with an uniform
motion, in a given time.</p>

               <p>Here it appears that as the moment is a
middle arithmetical proportional between
the decrement and increment; ſo is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the flowing line, or the velocity that
would generate the moment in the given
time 2<hi>ẋ,</hi> a middle arithmetical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
between the velocities that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
generate the decrement and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the ſame given time. And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
equally holds, whether the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be evaneſcent, or finite quantities of
whatſoever magnitude.</p>
               <p>Whence I infer, that although it were not
poſſible to conceive an evaneſcent moment
divided into two equal parts, yet as finite
ones may be conceived to be ſo divided, that
demonſtration of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s which
you object againſt, will ſtill hold firm and
entire, by ſubſtituting finite moments in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0030600600:82"/>
room of evaneſcent moments. Which is a
ſecret you were not aware of.</p>
               <p>One more obſervation, and I have done.
You would have us take the increment of
<hi>AB,</hi> or in this caſe the increment of <hi>x2</hi>, for
the moment of <hi>x2</hi>; that is, you would have
us take 2<hi>xẋ</hi>+<hi>ẋẋ,</hi> and not 2<hi>xẋ,</hi> for the
moment of <hi>x2</hi>: And yet you allow that the
moment of <hi>x2</hi> is proportional to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of <hi>x2</hi>. But the velocity of <hi>x2</hi> is <hi>x</hi>; and
the quantity you give us as the moment,
namely 2<hi>xẋ</hi>+<hi>ẋẋ,</hi> is not proportional to
this velocity <hi>x.</hi> Therefore by your own
conceſſion, that quantity is not the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But the quantity that Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
aſſigns, namely 2<hi>xẋ,</hi> has juſt now been
ſhown to be proportional to <hi>x,</hi> the velocity
of <hi>x2</hi>, and therefore is the true moment.
Now therefore I may ſafely repeat my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and <hi>ask with my accuſtomed air,</hi>
"What ſay you, Sir? Is this a juſt and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
reaſon for Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s proceeding
as he did? I think you muſt acknowledge
it to be ſo."</p>
               <p>But hark you! Why all this outcry about
Ghoſts and Viſions? Pray who firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

no other intent or purpoſe in the world but
your own diverſion.</p>
               <p>In conſideration of which I hope I may
be pardoned for bringing in one more,
though I can give no better reaſon for it,
than that the Apparition runs ſtrongly in my

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0030600600:88"/>
that this aſſertion, true or falſe, is no way
material to the point in debate between us.
You were fully anſwered before I laid down

before I vindicate it. Why therefore did I
make that aſſertion? Dear Sir, the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

in this part of ſcience. In due time it may

               <p>Do not miſtake me, Sir, I am not going

               <p>My aſſertion was, That the moment of

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0030600600:89"/>
to be diminiſhed <hi>ad infinitum</hi>; and this by

               </p>
               <p>You anſwer, <hi>If</hi> a <hi>and</hi> b <hi>are real quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
then</hi> ab <hi>is ſomething, and conſequently
makes a real difference; but if they are nothing,
then the rectangles whereof they are coefficients,
become nothing likewiſe; and conſequently the</hi>
momentum <hi>or</hi> incrementum, <hi>whether Sir</hi>
Iſaac<hi>'s or mine, are in that caſe nothing at
all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By giving this for an anſwer to my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is plain you have no notion of what
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> means by a quantity being
infinitely diminiſhed, though he has ſo fully
and clearly explained himſelf in the <hi>ſcholium</hi>
of that ſection of the <hi>Principia,</hi> which I ſo
often refer you to.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a given line to be gradually dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
during a given time, by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
motion of a point, ſo that at the end of
the given time the line would entirely vaniſh
and become nothing. Then if the motion
of the point, and the gradual diminution
of the line conſequent thereupon, be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſtop before the expiration of the
given time, it is plain that the line will not
as yet have been diminiſhed <hi>ad infinitum</hi>; it
will ſtill be ſomething, it will be a real
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0030600600:90"/>
quantity, it will be a finite quantity. But
if the motion go on, without ſtop or ſtay, to
the end of the given time, it is manifeſt that
the line muſt be diminiſhed <hi>ſine fine, ſine
limite,</hi> it muſt be diminiſhed <hi>ad infinitum,</hi>
it muſt vaniſh, it muſt become nothing.
The end of this diminution <hi>ad infinitum,</hi>
the vaniſhing of the line, and its becoming
nothing, theſe three muſt all happen at one
and the ſame inſtant of time, namely at the
expiration of the given time. So that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
before the expiration of the given time,
or before the quantity becomes nothing, it
cannot truly be ſaid to be actually diminiſhed
<hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Therefore while <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> are
real quantities, they are not yet diminiſhed
<hi>ad infinitum,</hi> they may be farther dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
And conſequently the firſt part of
your anſwer is quite beſide the purpoſe: It
tends only to ſhew that there is a real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the moment and increment,
before the inſtant of time when I ſuppoſe
them to become equal; that while they are
unequal, there is a difference between them.
A great diſcovery, and undoubtedly true!</p>
               <p>You proceed in your anſwer, <hi>If they,</hi> i.e.
a <hi>and</hi> b, <hi>are nothing, then the rectangles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are coefficients, become nothing likewiſe:</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0030600600:91"/>
                  <hi>and conſequently the</hi> momentum <hi>or</hi> incremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
<hi>whether Sir</hi> Iſaac'<hi>s or mine, are in that
caſe nothing at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This likewiſe is undoubtedly true. But it
is ſo far from contradicting Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
doctrine, that it is perfectly agreeable
to it. What he ſays, and what I contend
for, is this.</p>
               <p>Though ſo long as <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> are real quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
their rectangle <hi>ab</hi> is a real quantity,
and there is a real difference between the
two quantities <hi>aB</hi>+<hi>bA</hi> and <hi>aB</hi>+<hi>bA</hi>+<hi>ab</hi>:
Yet, when by a continual diminution
<hi>ad infinitum a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> vaniſh, their rectangle
<hi>ab,</hi> or the difference between the two quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
<hi>aB</hi>+<hi>bA</hi> and <hi>aB</hi>+<hi>bA</hi>+<hi>ab,</hi> vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
likewiſe, and there is no longer any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
left between thoſe quantities, <hi>i.e.</hi>
thoſe quantities are equal. But you ſay,
when <hi>ab,</hi> when the difference between theſe
two quantities vaniſhes, the quantities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
do likewiſe vaniſh. I agree with you.
Their difference therefore vaniſhes when
they vaniſh: And they vaniſh when their
difference vaniſhes: Or, The quantities
themſelves, and the difference between them,
vaniſh at one and the ſame inſtant of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0030600600:92"/>
You ſee I agree perfectly with you, that
the moment and increment vaniſh at the
ſame inſtant that their difference vaniſhes.
All I contend for is this, That the moment
and increment vaniſh with a ratio of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that they do ſo, I am going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
after Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>Let the rectangle <hi>AE</hi> repreſent 2<hi>xẋ,</hi> the
moment, and let the rectangle <hi>AF</hi> repreſent
2<hi>xẋ</hi>+<hi>ẋẋ,</hi> the increment of the flowing
ſquare <hi>x2</hi>. I ſay when <hi>ẋ</hi> vaniſhes, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
2<hi>xẋ,</hi> and the increment 2<hi>xẋ</hi>+<hi>ẋẋ,</hi> will
vaniſh with a ratio of equality.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0030600600:93"/>
rectangles <hi>AE, AF</hi> be proportional to the
rectangles <hi>Ae, Af.</hi> Now let <hi>CB</hi> be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and vaniſh into nothing
by the coincidence of the point <hi>C</hi> with the

coincide, the lines <hi>CFf, BEe</hi> will likewiſe
coincide, <hi>i.e.</hi> the rectangles <hi>Ae, Af,</hi> will
coincide and become perfectly equal, and at
the ſame inſtant the rectangles <hi>AE, AF,</hi>
i.e. the moment and increment, will vaniſh.
But at the inſtant that the rectangles <hi>Ae, Af</hi>
become equal, the rectangles proportional to
theſe, <hi>AE</hi> and <hi>AF</hi> muſt likewiſe become e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.
Therefore theſe rectangles vaniſh and
become equal at one and the ſame inſtant of
time, or vaniſh with a ratio of equality.
<hi>Q.E.D.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am ſo deſirous of leaving both you, Sir,
and my reader without any ſcruple upon this
point, that I cannot content myſelf with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrating, that in fact the thing is as
I ſay, unleſs I likewiſe ſhew you by what
means it comes to be ſo. The caſe is this.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>ẋ</hi> is gradually diminiſhed, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
between the increment and moment is
likewiſe perpetually diminiſhed, and tends
to a certain limit which it can never paſs,
and can never arrive at till <hi>ẋ</hi> is diminiſhed <hi>ad</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0030600600:94"/>
                     <hi>infinitum,</hi> and vaniſhes into nothing. That
limit is equality.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe while <hi>ẋ</hi> is gradually diminiſhed,
the increment and moment are perpetually
diminiſhed, and tend to a certain limit, which
they can never arrive at till <hi>ẋ</hi> is diminiſhed
<hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and vaniſhes into nothing. That
limit is nothing.</p>
                  <p>So that the ratio of the increment and
moment, and the increment and moment, do
both arrive at their ſeveral limits, <hi>i.e.</hi> at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
and at nothing, at one and the ſame
inſtant of time. That is, the increment and
moment become equal and vaniſh, vaniſh
and become equal, at the ſame inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Methinks, Sir, you and I are now ſo far
agreed, that it is pity there ſhould be any
difference between us about the <hi>Lemma</hi> I
quoted to you. But as it may be of ſome

to us both another time, I am willing to

though I greatly fear it will be loſt

uſe of it, than you did of the friendly advice I
gave you in my laſt letter, to weight very well
what Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> ſays, before you cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

<hi>let the increments be nothing, or let there be no

the Reader believe that this is the whole of
the queſtion between us: That we have each
of us ſpent four or five pages, and may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſpend twice as many more before we
have done, in wrangling about the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of four <hi>Latin</hi> words. If ſo, methinks
his beſt way will be to let us wrangle by our
ſelves, and to tranſlate thoſe four words
himſelf as he thinks fit, without ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
his head about us.</p>
               <p>But I take the queſtion between us to be
of a little more extent, and of ſomewhat
more importance. What I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to eſtabliſh the ſenſe of, is not thoſe four
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0030600600:99"/>
words alone, but the whole paſſage taken
together, <hi>i.e.</hi> in the ſtyle of divines, the
text and the context. The whole paſſage is,
<hi>Evaneſcant jam augmenta illa &amp; eorum ratio
ultima erit,</hi> and I have endeavoured to ſettle
the meaning of this whole paſſage taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by comparing it with an equivalent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,

               <p>The queſtion therefore between us is not
barely how thoſe four words may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated:
If they ſtood alone, they might be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
twenty different ways: But the queſtion
is, how theſe four words ought to be tranſlated
in conjunction with the other words that
follow; how the whole paſſage ought to be
tranſlated, ſo as to let the Reader underſtand
the meaning and deſign of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>
in that paſſage. His deſign is manifeſtly to
conſider the proportion between the evane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
augments, or to conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with which the augments vaniſh.
He plainly makes two ſuppoſitions in
this paſſage. The firſt is, that the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
vaniſh, or become nothing. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that the augments have a laſt ratio.
And his buſineſs is to determine what this
laſt ratio is: Now the queſtion between you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0030600600:100"/>
and me is, when, at what inſtant of time
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> ſuppoſes the augments to
have this laſt ratio? You will needs have it,
that he ſuppoſes the augments firſt to vaniſh,
to become nothing, and then conſiders the
proportion between thoſe nothings. I
maintain, that he conſiders the proportion
between the augments, not after they are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
but at the inſtant that they vaniſh,
in the very point of evaneſcence. And I am
juſtified by his own words, where he more
fully explains himſelf,<note n="*" place="bottom">Schol. Sect. 1. Libr. 1. Princip.</note>

You ſee therefore, Sir, the hard words, you
ſay, I have uſed, do not fall upon my Friends,
but fall where I intended them. The blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of making the quantities firſt become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and then ſettling the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thoſe nothings, ſtands juſt as it did.
It puts me in mind of an Evidence, who was
inſtructed to ſwear that a certain will was
made juſt as the Teſtator was dying, and
was therefore ſubſequent to another will
made ſome time before his death. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
reſolved to make ſure work, and ſwore
poſitively that this was the laſt will, for it
was made after the Teſtator was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0030600600:101"/>
You ſee likewiſe you had no reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of making me acknowledge, that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
and becoming nothing were equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
terms with Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi> Indeed,
how was it poſſible to think otherwiſe? A
naſcent augment muſt have been nothing
before it began to exiſt, and an evaneſcent
augment muſt be nothing after it ceaſes to
exiſt.</p>
               <p>As it is my buſineſs chiefly to keep upon
the defenſive, and I have hitherto had very
little occaſion to act offenſively, I did in my
firſt Letter conſider your important <hi>Lemma</hi>
and reaſoning upon it, no farther than was
neceſſary to juſtify Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> againſt
the conſequences you draw from that <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
But now, as you are pleaſed to ſhew
more than ordinary arrogance in this and the
following ſection, I hope the reader will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me, if I ſtep out of my way to call you
a little to account. A vigilant General,
who is aſſaulted in his entrenchments by an
overbearing and inſolent Enemy, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
obſerve that Enemy in the heat of his
attack, to lay himſelf ſo open, as to give a
fair opportunity of ſallying out and chaſtiſing
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0030600600:102"/>
And it may not be amiſs to ſhew, that
Mathematicians are not the only perſons,
who <hi>falſely imagine their rational faculties to
be more improved than thoſe of other men, which
have been exerciſed in a different manner, and
on different ſubjects.</hi> That there are other
perſons, who <hi>erect themſelves into judges and
oracles, concerning matters,</hi> which they have
<hi>never</hi> ſufficiently <hi>conſidered nor comprehended.</hi>
And if this appear, it will ſurely <hi>furniſh a
fair</hi> argumentum ad hominem <hi>againſt men,
who reject that very thing in</hi> Geometry <hi>which
they admit in</hi> Logick. It will be <hi>a proper way
to abate the pride, and diſcredit the pretenſions
of theſe</hi> Logicians and Metaphyſicians, <hi>who
inſiſt upon clear Ideas in points of</hi> Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
<hi>if it be ſhewn that they do without
them in their own ſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of your <hi>Lemma</hi> is this. If
one ſuppoſition be made, and be afterwards
deſtroy'd by a CONTRARY ſuppoſition;
then every thing that followed from the
firſt ſuppoſition, is deſtroyed with it. This
being laid down, you proceed thus. Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> ſuppoſes certain increments to
exiſt, or that there are certain increments.
In conſequence of their ſuppoſed exiſtence,
he forms certain expreſſions of thoſe incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0030600600:103"/>
with intent to deduce the proportion
of the increments from thoſe expreſſions.
He afterwards ſuppoſes that thoſe incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
vaniſh, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſay you, that the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are nothing, that there are no incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>I forbear making any remarks upon your
interpretation of the word vaniſh. I admit
it to be as you are pleaſed to make it, that
the firſt ſuppoſition is, there are increments;
and that the ſecond ſuppoſition is, there are
no increments. What do you infer from
this? The ſecond ſuppoſition, ſay you, is
contrary to the former, and deſtroys the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and in deſtroying the former it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
the expreſſions, the proportions, and
every thing elſe derived from the former
ſuppoſition. Not too faſt, good Mr. <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</hi>
If I ſay, the increments now exiſt,
and, the increments do not now exiſt; the
latter aſſertion will be contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
ſuppoſing now to mean the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of time in both aſſertions. But if I
ſay at one time, the increments now exiſt;
and ſay an hour after, the increments do not
now exiſt; the latter aſſertion will neither
be contrary, nor contradictory to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
becauſe the firſt now ſignifies one
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0030600600:104"/>
time, and the ſecond now ſignifies another
time, ſo that both aſſertions may be true.
The caſe therefore in your argument does
not come up to your <hi>Lemma,</hi> unleſs you will
ſay Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> ſuppoſes that there are
increments, and that there are no increments,
at the ſame inſtant of time. Which is what
you have not ſaid, and what, I hope, you will
not dare to ſay.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſtill maintain, that
whether the ſecond ſuppoſition be eſteemed
contrary, or not contrary, to the firſt, yet
as the increments, which were ſuppoſed at firſt
to exiſt, are now ſuppoſed not to exiſt, but
to be vaniſhed and gone, all the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their ſuppoſed exiſtence, as their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
proportions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt now be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be vaniſhed and gone with them.
I cannot allow of this neither.</p>
               <p>Let us imagine your ſelf and me to be
debating this matter, in an open field, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from any ſhelter, and in the middle
of a large company of Mathematicians and
Logicians. A ſudden violent rain falls.
The conſequence is, we are all wet to the
ſkin. Before we can get to covert, it clears
up, and the Sun ſhines. You are for going
on with the diſpute. I deſire to be excuſed,
I muſt go home and ſhift my cloaths, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0030600600:105"/>
adviſe you to do the ſame. You endeavour
to perſuade me I am not wet. The ſhower,
ſay you, is vaniſhed and gone, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
your coldneſs, and wetneſs, and every
thing derived from the exiſtence of the
ſhower, muſt have vaniſhed with it. I tell
you I feel my ſelf cold and wet. I take my
leave, and make haſte home. I am perſuaded
the Mathematicians would all take the ſame
courſe, and ſhould think them but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Logicians, that were moved by your
arguments to ſtay behind.</p>
               <p>Another example may make all clear. I
know a certain Gentleman, who about the
firſt day of <hi>April</hi> 1734, was verily perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he ſaw more clearly into the principles
of fluxions, than Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> had ever
done. The conſequence of this perſuaſion
was, that he publiſhed a book, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
convinced all mankind of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
He has ſince had ſuch reaſons given
him, as have entirely altered his opinion.
His former perſuaſion is vaniſhed and gone;
but the book that was the conſequence of
that perſuaſion, is not vaniſhed and gone
with it. It would have been much for his
credit, and for the quiet of the poor Genle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
mind, if it had.</p>

               <p>XXXV. You miſtake me, Sir: What I
diſlike in you is not your <hi>modeſty,</hi> but your
arrogance. 'Tis your unparallel'd and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
inſolence, to the greateſt diſcoverer of
truth, of a mere mortal, that ever appeared
in the world.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, that <hi>placing the ſame
point in various lights is of great uſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have not ſhown Sir Iſaac Newton'<hi>s
various accounts of fluxions</hi> to be <hi>inconſiſtent.</hi>
I find them perfectly conſiſtent, and do
again profeſs my ſelf greatly obliged to him
for his condeſcenſion, in ſetting his doctrine
in ſeveral different lights, without which, <hi>I</hi>
ſtill <hi>doubt, I ſhould never have underſtood it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you ſeem to think it great vanity in
me, to talk as if I underſtood the doctrine
of Fluxions. Why, Sir! I hope Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi> wrote ſo as to be underſtood by
ſomebody. I have taken pains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
him, and I ſuppoſe many others to
underſtand him likewiſe: I prefer my ſelf to
no body, and I never compare my ſelf with
any body but one. It is where I ſpeak
of ſuch ordinary Proficients in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
as you and me. Even there, you ſee,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0030600600:107"/>
I have the good manners to place you firſt.
Had I ſaid, no body underſtands him, but I:
Or, I don't underſtand him, and therefore
no body can underſtand him, it were unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
vanity.</p>
               <p>You ſay, I inſult you, in asking what it is
you are offended at, who do not ſtill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
him? I neither inſult you, nor blame
you, for not underſtanding him: But it is, I
think, pretty extraordinary for a man, who
ſo often profeſſes not to underſtand Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton,</hi> to complain that Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> takes too
much pains to explain and illuſtrate his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
by ſetting it in ſeveral different lights.
As to your requeſt to help you out of the
dark, I have done my beſt, and hope you ſee
much better than you did. The eye-water I
have applied, might poſſibly give you ſome
pain; but it will do you a power of good.

yourſelf to me in the following words.
"You will have it, that I repreſent Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi>'s concluſions as coming out right,
becauſe one error is compenſated by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contrary and equal error, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he never knew himſelf nor thought
of: that by a twofold miſtake he arrives,
though not at Science yet at Truth: that
he proceeds blindfold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which is
untruly ſaid by you, who have miſapplied
to Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> what was intended
for the <hi>Marquis de l'Hoſpital</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers."
If this was untruly ſaid by me,
I aſſure you it was not a wilful untruth. You
ſee Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> fell into that miſtake as well
as I. And I do not know a ſingle perſon
who has read the Analyſt, but is in the ſame
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0030600600:109"/>
miſtake. However, a miſtake it undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
is; no body ought in the leaſt to diſpute
it, after a perſon of your character has made
the publick declaration juſt now recited, and
has farther aſſured us, that <hi>this double error
doth concern the Marquis alone, and not Sir</hi>
Iſaac Newton. Far be it from me to call the
truth or ſincerity of this declaration in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
On the contrary, I aſk your pardon
for my miſtake; and to make you all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in my power, I do hereby retract,
recant and abjure my error, and abandon my
picture, my <hi>ingenious portraiture of Sir</hi> Iſaac
Newton <hi>and</hi> Dame Fortune, to the flames.
If you are not yet ſatisfied, I beg leave to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the following reaſons in mitigation of
my offence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your diſcourſe ſeemed to me to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to a follower of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi>
And as in Sect. XX. of the Analyſt, where
this affair of the double error begins, you
perpetually addreſs yourſelf to him in the
ſecond perſon, as <hi>you demonſtrate, you are
converſant, you conceive, you proceed, you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
your concluſions, your logick and method,</hi>
&amp;c. I too haſtily judged that the double er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
related to this follower, and conſequently
to his maſter.</p>

                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0030600600:110"/>
2. As this affair is purſued through eleven
Sections, beginning at Sect. XX. and ending
with Sect. XXX. I find Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s
way of notation to be uſed in three of thoſe
Sections, and the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s notation in two.
I find Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s language and expreſſion, as
increments, moments, fluxions, infinitely
diminiſhed, vaniſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be uſed in nine
of thoſe Sections, and the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s language
and expreſſion, as differences, infiniteſimals,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſeven of thoſe Sections. Whence it
ſeemed to me, that Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> was as
much concerned in this matter, as the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In one of thoſe Sections, namely Sect.
XXVI. you refer to Sect. XII, and XIII.; in
the firſt of which Sections, <hi>viz.</hi> Sect. XII. I
find this Quotation, <hi>Philoſophiae Naturalis
Principia Mathematica, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>lemm.</hi> 2. and
Sect. XIII. contains nothing elſe but your
inſtance of falſe reaſoning taken from Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Book of Quadratures. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in another of thoſe Sections, namely
Sect. XXVIII. I find the ſame thirteenth
Section quoted. From all which it ſeemed
to me, that Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> was rather more
concerned in this affair than the <hi>Marquis,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0030600600:111"/>
whoſe works I do not find to be quoted in
any of thoſe Sections, ſo much as once.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The arguments uſed in the Analyſt
ſeemed to me to bear equally hard againſt
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> and the <hi>Marquis</hi>; ſo that I
could not ſee how you could condemn the
one, and acquit the other, of either of the
two errors.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations had ſo fully poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
my mind, that Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by you to be guilty of this double er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
that nothing, but my firm perſuaſion of
your veracity and integrity, could ever have
removed that apprehenſion. I muſt own, I
have ſtill one ſcruple upon my thoughts. If
you will be ſo good as to remove that, my
mind will be perfectly eaſy about this affair.
It is this.</p>
               <p>The firſt error in giving 2<hi>xdx</hi> for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
or 2<hi>xẋ</hi> for the moment of <hi>xx,</hi> is
common to the <hi>Marquis</hi> and Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Marquis</hi> makes a ſecond error, which
perfectly corrects the firſt, whence his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
comes out right.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> makes no ſecond error to
correct his firſt, and therefore his concluſion
ought to come out wrong.</p>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0030600600:112"/>
And yet Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s concluſion comes out
exactly right, and is the ſame with the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi>'s
concluſion. The more I conſider this,
the more it puzzles me: Poſſibly, for want of
the <hi>Philoſophia prima,</hi> which you are ſo great

               <p>XLIII. The ſame, or ſomething worſe.
I apprehend it was, as you ſay, <hi>diſcreetly</hi>
done, to fix upon two or three of the main
points, and to <hi>overlook</hi> the reſt of the <hi>difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
propoſed in the Analyſt,</hi> particularly the
Queries, threeſcore and ſeven in number.
You tell me, I am <hi>not afraid nor aſhamed
to repreſent the Analyſts as very clear and
uniform in their conceptions of theſe matters.</hi>
Where have I ſo repreſented them? I
know there is a great diverſity of opinions
among Analyſts: Some follow <hi>Monſieur Leib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz,</hi>
ſome the <hi>Marquis de l'Hoſpital,</hi>
ſome, other writers, and ſome, whom I take
to be the better judges, follow Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton,</hi> and theſe are <hi>uniform</hi> ſo far as they
follow their maſter, and <hi>clear</hi> ſo far as they
underſtand him.</p>

perhaps 5 or 6, of every one of thoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0030600600:116"/>
one would think that Country, where
you have reſided for thoſe ten months, muſt
be better ſtocked with Mathematicians
than all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> I hope they are
not all <hi>Infidels.</hi> If they are, it is a mercy
they are not very able <hi>Infidels,</hi> at leaſt ſo far
as one can judge of them by their mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

               <p>XLV, XLVI, XLVII, XVIII. You come
now to the point of Metaphyſicks in diſpute

and unintelligibly, as plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
me <hi>you have ſome other end to ſerve
than truth.</hi> And upon reviſing what I had
before addreſſed to you upon this ſubject, I
think I neither can, nor need, ſet that matter
in a clearer light, than I have already done. I
perceive likewiſe, my rebukes have had a good
effect upon you. You make excuſes. <hi>It was

your ſelf with ſome modeſty, <hi>all this looks
very like a contradiction</hi>; with ſome other
ſigns of grace, that give me hopes, as you
are now made to ſee your errors, you may
in time be brought to acknowledge them.</p>
               <p>It muſt be owned in your favour, you
have already recanted the principal of them,
and that which led to all the reſt, as amply
and fully, as from you could poſſibly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
You had expreſſed your ſelf in Art.
CXXV of your new Theory of Viſion, in the
following words. "After reiterated endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to apprehend the GENERAL
IDEA of a Triangle, I have found it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
incomprehenſible." But now,
<q>Ut primum diſcuſſaeumbrae, &amp; lux redditamenti,</q>
your eyes being opened, (pardon me this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)
by the arguments I have done my
ſelf the honour of laying before you, you
are pleaſed to ſay, "This implies that I
hold, there are no GENERAL IDEAS.
But I hold the direct contrary, that there
are INDEED GENERAL IDEAS,
but not formed by abſtraction in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſet forth by Mr. <hi>Locke.</hi>"</p>

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0030600600:118"/>
I am ſo much pleaſed with this piece of
ingenuity and candid proceeding, that for
the ſake of it I willingly excuſe all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
however inconſiſtent with this recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Particularly your making no difference
between a round ſquare, and a ſpace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by three right lines. For the
ſame reaſon I willingly paſs by your ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that the words of my definition have no
ideas, or conceptions of the mind, joined with
them, and conſequently that the definition
has no meaning. For to make the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
have a meaning, ſome particular idea,
ſimple or compound, muſt be joined to every
word uſed in it; and a compound idea, made
up of all thoſe particular ideas, muſt be joined
to, and always go along with the whole defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And theſe two, the compound idea
and the definition are inſeparable, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
be underſtood. Methinks therefore,
inſtead of ſeparating theſe, it were better to
make a diſtinction between this compound
idea anſwering to the definition of a triangle,
and the image, or ſenſible repreſentation of
a triangle; two things which I have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you often to confound, both here and in
your other writings. The compound idea
is general, but the image, if exactly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0030600600:119"/>
to and adequately perceived by the mind,
muſt always be particular.</p>
