            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Britiſh poſſeſſions in India are now become ſo extenſive as to require for their defence a numerous body of our countrymen; many of whom, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a new and injurious climate, as well as other unfavourable changes, fall victims to the conſequences of emigration. The prevention of this fatality may, in ſome caſes, exceed the utmoſt efforts of medicine; but it is certain that in others, and thoſe by far the greateſt number, the operation of the cauſes above-mentioned prove chiefly delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious from the imperfect knowledge hitherto attained of the nature of diſeaſes in India. Among thoſe to which Europeans are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expoſed, the moſt common, and perhaps likewiſe the moſt fatal, is the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patitis, or Inflammation of the Liver; an accurate inveſtigation of which muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0059501700:5"/>be an object of the firſt importance to every practitioner in that country.</p>
            <p>There are as yet only three publications on this diſeaſe in England, and they are defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as they were given by their authors, in conſequence of ſome caſes which they met with at ſea; inconſiderable either in number or variety when compared with thoſe which happen in the field.</p>
            <p>The Author of the preſent Treatiſe landed in India with the care of a thouſand of his Majeſty's troops, and other regiments fell to his charge. He thus had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing the Hepatitis in all it's varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of form, and of attending minutely to it's phoenomena.</p>
            <p>This led him to attempt an innovation in the practice, which he found ſucceſsful for the laſt nine months of his continuance in that country.</p>
            <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0059501700:6"/>
            <p>Since his Eſſay on the Hepatitis has been in the preſs, the report of four new-raiſed regiments being to be ſent to India, has induced him to add an Eſſay on the Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic Affections, which preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves immediately on the arrival of the troops with whom he landed in that country.</p>
            <p>Spaſms are very likely to be the firſt diſeaſes of Europeans in India. And as the Author recollects no Engliſh Treatiſe on the Spaſms in India drawn from perſonal obſervation, he has given the annexed conciſe account, rather than delay it's publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation until he could find leiſure to enlarge upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>He has however omitted nothing either in the Hepatitis or Spaſms which he can think of that has any immediate reference to the practical parts of theſe ſubjects; though he is far from entertaining the idea that he
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0059501700:7"/>has at length exhauſted either of them by his own obſervations.</p>
            <p>He truſts that the endeavour to furniſh the officer and inexperienced practitioner to theſe climates with the means of preventing and of curing two of the moſt formidable diſeaſes of the Eaſt, will amply apologize for the numerous defects which a critical reader may, no doubt, diſcern in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pages.</p>

               <head>AN ESSAY ON THE HEPATITIS IN INDIA.</head>
               <p>THOSE who are converſant in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writings, or have attended much to diſſections in hoſpitals, know in how many patients the liver, which had never been ſuſpected of any diſeaſe, has been found, after death, in a morbid ſtate. It is a fact, that, in a great number of ſuch caſes, the affected part has gone through all the different ſtages of the latent diſeaſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0059501700:10"/>without ever exhibiting any of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms by which we are taught, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of noſologiſts, to diſtinguiſh it.</p>
               <p>Without paying any regard to defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſhall therefore proceed to a faithful relation of the Hepatitis, as it appeared in ſeveral hundreds of the men and officers, during and after a campaign of twenty-two months, in the Carnatic and Tanjore countries of India.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe is more common to the military than to any other ſet of people, and to thoſe eſpecially who ſerve on the Coromandel coaſt, as in this quarter the fatigues of the troops are the greateſt. In Bengal, where all the expeditions are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on only by water, in veſſels covered from the rays of the ſun, and where the proviſions are better and more regularly ſupplied, diſeaſed livers are much leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. From the hiſtory of this diſeaſe, it will appear not to be ſo acute as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imagined; but that it may, and very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0059501700:11"/>often does, continue in a chronic ſtate, for weeks, months, ſometimes years, and becomes ſuddenly acute by intemperance in drinking, or the improper uſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. The ſymptoms of vomiting, hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup, or pain of the ſide or ſhoulder, too generally imagined to be neceſſary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of this diſeaſe, will not be found to have accompanied one half of the caſes of diſeaſed liver, which have gone through all their different ſtages.</p>
               <p>Without taking any notice of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pathology of the diſeaſe, I ſhall divide the phenomena into three ſtages, viz. the chronic, acute, and ſuppurative; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them in the order in which they appeared. To prove the acute ſtage not to be alſo a ſuppurative one, I have no facts. But as one of theſe ſtages always yields to a-peculiar treatment, and the other ſeldom to any, the diſtinction may not be unneceſſary.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0059501700:12"/>
                  <head>THE FIRST, OR CHRONIC STAGE.</head>
                  <p>FOR ſome time before the pain of the ſhoulder and ſide becomes violent, the animal ſpirits are much diminiſhed: the ſtools begin to be very irregular, ſome days ſcarce any, at others very profuſe and acrid: the countenance is tumid and bloated. Sometimes the tunica albuginea of the eyes is yellow, but more commonly of a dull white appearance. The ſkin, eſpecially of the muſcular parts of the body, is dry and ſqualid.</p>
                  <p>The urine is generally more or leſs high coloured, and ſmall in quantity; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration ſcanty and partial; the tongue dry with thirſt. The ſtomach is extremely variable: frequently, before dinner, there is a momentary ſickneſs, which is almoſt as inſtantly ſucceeded by a ſenſation of hunger. After eating, all theſe ſymptoms
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0059501700:13"/>are alleviated for an hour or two, and then ſucceeded, either by heartburn or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gripes; the pulſe is ſmall, hard, and quick, eſpecially towards the evening; the gums contract a hardneſs; the ſhoulders appear daily more elevated. In many there is a dull pain in the lumbar region.</p>
                  <p>After theſe ſymptoms have continued for ſome time, an induration of a part of the liver may be ſometimes felt, by laying the patient on his back, with the head low, and the knees a little elevated. The patient frequently continues in this ſtate for a conſiderable time, until the dejection of ſpirits, which always more or leſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this diſeaſe, prompts him to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate uſe of wine, which ſcarcely ever fails to accelerate the approach of the acute or inflammatory ſtage.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0059501700:14"/>
                  <head>THE SECOND, OR INFLAMMATORY STAGE.</head>
                  <p>THE countenance, which, from the beginning of the preceding ſtage, had contracted a morbid appearance, becomes now, at intervals, more florid than was common to the patient even in his beſt health. The ſtools are ſmall, frequent, and reſembling thoſe in the dyſentery. The pain of the ſhoulder and ſide, which before was obtuſe and ſhifting, eſpecially that of the former, becomes ſuddenly very acute. When this pain of the ſhoulder is felt, it always correſponds with that part of the liver which is moſt immediately diſeaſed; being more or leſs anteriorly or poſteriorly ſituated, according as the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior or poſterior parts of the liver are the ſeat of the complaint: and with the left lobe the left ſhoulder is frequently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. In this ſtage the pain of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0059501700:15"/>ſhoulder is frequently increaſed on every motion of the diaphragm, attended with a troubleſome ſhort cough, and catching of the breath, in inſpirations, as well as an increaſed pain on the region of the liver being touched. Sometimes the eaſieſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is on the diſeaſed ſide, at other times on the oppoſite; but more commonly on the back, with the head rather low. The Hepatitis, in this ſtage, begins its attack as often with a flux and teneſmus as with a fixed pain of the ſhoulder; and in this caſe the perſon falls a ſacrifice to a miſtaken conception of the diſeaſe. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this fallacious appearance the ſick is commonly relieved by ſalts, or ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle laxatives, until, the acute ſtage being palliated, the diſeaſe aſſumes the primitive chronic form; in which ſtate he continues with irregular ſecretions, the urine high coloured, the countenance of a ſallow complexion, and every day impreſſed with an air of additional melancholy. Many unfortunate perſons, driven to deſpair, by the continuance of the complaint for one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0059501700:16"/>or two years, have at length periſhed by violent means, which their ungovernable impatience had ſuggeſted. The period moſt uſually fatal is the acceſſion of the third ſtage, which is haſtened by the uſe both of aſtringents and bitters.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>THE THIRD, OR SUPPURATIVE STAGE.</head>
                  <p>IN a few days or weeks after the dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teric ſymptoms have abated, the patient becomes ſo tired of the looſeneſs which remains, that he is deſirous of having it flopped. For this purpoſe, the common practice is to order aſtringents or bitters, which indeed ſoon check the looſeneſs; but, in a ſhort time after, he is attacked with a deep hollow-ſounding cough, from that ſide of the lungs which correſponds to the lobe of the liver moſt diſeaſed.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0059501700:17"/>
                  <p>Whenever the cough commences the greateſt part of that ſide of the liver is generally occupied with an abſceſs, by which its ſubſtance is already conſumed; though this purulent collection ſeldom gave any token of its exiſtence, until it had opened to itſelf a paſſage through the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm and lungs, or into the cavity of the abdomen. In this emergency the patient is either ſuffocated by the ſudden inundation of the lungs, or miſerably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires by the more ſlow effects of incurable inanition, which is promoted by an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted diſcharge of the aliments, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with flatulence and gripes.</p>
                  <p>Where no aſtringents have been given, there are ſometimes diſcovered more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial ſuppurations, which are eaſily opened with the knife, and cured in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe which ſucceed the ſudden ſtoppage of the looſeneſs, when this inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is attended with a deep hollow-ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0059501700:18"/>cough, prove equally mortal, whether they point outwardly or penetrate the cavities.</p>
                  <p>In theſe forms the Hepatitis moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made its appearance. But there is another ſhape, under which it remained for years, without running into the more acute ſtages, eſpecially among the natives and thoſe Europeans who had arrived in the country at a very early period. This form is that of an intermittent fever, irregular in its acceſſions, ſometimes uſhered in by a cold, though oftener only by a hot ſtage; but never without the pulſe becoming ſmaller and quicker: the duration of the hot or ſweating ſtage likewiſe bearing no proportion to the length or ſhortneſs of the cold one. It is called the Hill-fever, from its being endemic in the hilly parts of the Carnatic; and is often conſidered as incurable.</p>
                  <p>In all the caſes I have ſeen of this kind the livers were diſeaſed, eſpecially the left
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0059501700:19"/>lobes; and the patients were reſtored to health only by treating their complaints as diſeaſed livers.</p>
                  <p>Authors generally mention vomitings as concomitant ſymptoms when the concave parts, and hiccups, when the convex parts of the liver are diſeaſed. But I have ſeen both parts impoſthumated without either of theſe ſymptoms; and indeed have very ſeldom met with them in any hepatic complaints. A nauſea and want of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite are much more common in the latter ſtages of this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The pain in this diſeaſe is uſually aſcribed to an adheſion of the convex part of the liver to the peritoneum; the conſequence of which is, that the patients are induced to lie on the diſeaſed ſide. But when the concave part is affected, to recline on the oppoſite ſide is an eaſier ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Matthews has remarked that only perſons in whom the thorax is narrow have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0059501700:20"/>any pain in the epigaſtric, and thoſe in whom it is broad, in the lumbar region</p>
                  <p>But, as far as I ever could obſerve, theſe pains alternated in each of the patients independently of any difference in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the cheſt.</p>
                  <p>Whether the pain of the ſhoulder ariſes from the adheſion to the diaphragm, as ſome have ſuppoſed, or from the junction of the phrenic nerve, with the third and fourth of the cervical, I cannot pretend to ſay; but that it does not depend always upon the enlargement of the liver, I can with great confidence affirm; having ſeen many amazingly enlarged, by abſceſſes formed in them, where this ſymptom had never been obſerved by the patients.</p>
                  <p>The free deſcent of the tranſverſe ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, upon which reſpiration much depends, being impeded, a greater or leſs degree of dyſpnoea muſt neceſſarily enſue.</p>

                  <p>I never yet ſaw the diſeaſe in any who was not an adult.

                  <p>THE melancholy which takes place in the Hepatitis, the diminution of bile in melancholy, the increaſed ſecretion of bile from anger, ſun-ſtrokes and injuries of the cranium, with their conſequences, all ſerve to prove a remarkable ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the liver and brain. I am therefore inclined to believe, that, next to the rays of the ſun and exceſſes in ſpirituous liquors, all the depreſſing paſſions are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the moſt certain remote cauſes of this diſeaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">The melancholy which often attends people in Britain, after very active lives in Aſia, is generally attributed to moral cauſes. But perhaps the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical cauſes may have a far greater ſhare in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction than has been commonly imagined. A certain gloom appears to be inſeparable from a diſeaſed liver. Few perſons who have been long in that country, expoſed to the rays of the ſun by long marches, whoſe livers are not in the firſt ſtage of this diſeaſe.

                  <head>GREAT REPLETION AFTER LONG FASTING.</head>
                  <p>AS the troops were frequently expoſed to long faſting, they were very apt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their ſtomachs. To prove this to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0059501700:28"/>be a highly debilitating cauſe, the following recent and well-known fact may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. At the famine at Madras, in October 1782, ſeveral native children were taken by the Engliſh to their tables; by their extreme voracity, their viſcera ſoon became diſeaſed, their bellies tumefied, and ſchirrous indurations were to be felt in all thoſe who had not their diet limited for a conſiderable time.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall afterwards have occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the effects of mercury, in treating of the cure of this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now hazard a few conjectures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the proximate cauſe of this diſeaſe; though I would not be underſtood as being dogmatical on a point of ſo much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of a relaxation of the ſyſtem, eſpecially of the ultimate branches of the vena portarum, the ſecretion of bile is not only diminiſhed, but that which is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0059501700:29"/>ſecreted is more watery than uſual, and leſs endowed with the natural qualities of the bile. On this account chylification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes imperfect, and all the different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinal phaenomena are produced. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have related the diſſection of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients affected with dyſenteries, whoſe livers were found diſeaſed; and theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances are conformable to the doctrine now mentioned. In many caſes of chronic dyſenteries I found the livers in one of the ſtages above deſcribed. The ſpaſm of the colon, in thoſe complaints, therefore, can only be conſidered as the effects of the ſtate of the bile, and not the proximate cauſe of this diſeaſe. Though ſalts frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the tormina and ſpaſms, they never are ſufficient to remove the diſeaſe, except where they induce a new and continued energy in the biliary ducts, ſo that ſtools copiouſly and regularly charged with a deep yellow bile are produced. As a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation of this opinion, I may add, that the moſt obſtinate of theſe dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries readily yielded to the ſame treatment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0059501700:30"/>as the Hepatitis after every other method had failed.</p>
                  <p>From the gradual diminution of bile in the Hepatitis, as well as the gradual dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions of energy in the ſyſtem, there is every reaſon to ſuſpect: the extremities of the vena portarum to be the ſeat of this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>From the few nerves ſent to the liver, there is but little reaſon to expect much energy through the medium of thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; and on account of the diſtance of the vena portarum from the heart, there is ſtill leſs reaſon to expect much influence from a <hi>vis a tergo.</hi> Why, then, along continued weakneſs of the ſyſtem ſhould always produce diſeaſed livers in India, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me not to be ſo difficult a queſtion, as why the ſame cauſe ſhould not render this a more frequent diſeaſe in other cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the diagnoſtic ſymptoms,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0059501700:31"/>the pain of the ſhoulder and ſide, when it exiſts, is a very certain characteriſtic of the diſeaſe; but it cannot be conſidered as a pathognomonic ſymptom, as it is by no means conſtant.</p>
                  <p>The elevation of the ſhoulders, as the diſeaſe advanced, was evident; but this poſſibly may take place in other morbid affections.</p>
                  <p>The hardneſs of the gums was a very conſtant attendant; but this, likewiſe, is common to many perſons, both in a ſtate of health and diſeaſe; and therefore, of itſelf, can form no certain diagnoſtic.</p>
                  <p>The puſhing the fingers againſt the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondres would ſometimes give a ſenſe of pain or itching to one of the ſhoulders. But, upon the whole, I am of opinion that the preſence of this diſeaſe can only be aſcertained by attending to the whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of phaenomena; as it ſo often exiſts without the pain of the ſide and ſhoulder,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0059501700:32"/>and as the hardneſs of the gums and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſhoulders, appear not of themſelves to be evident and ſufficient diagnoſtics.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ſtage, if the cure be properly attended to, we may with certainty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a favourable termination of the diſeaſe. We may be equally confident in the prognoſis of the ſecond ſtage, when the tongue becomes furred, and the gums leſs hard from the treatment about to be recommended. In the third ſtage, the tongue frequently remains clean, and the gums cannot be affected. The prognoſis in the laſt ſtage can never be favourable, unleſs we can be ſure that the ſuppuration is ſmall and ſuperficial.</p>
                  <p>The indication of cure in this diſeaſe is to reſtore the energy of the ſyſtem, and of the vena portarum. This may be done frequently in the firſt, and ſometimes ſecond ſtages of the diſeaſe, by change of climate, and avoiding the other remote cauſes. But
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0059501700:33"/>all the common methods uſed in northern climates proved in theſe caſes ineffectual. From ſmall doſes of neutral ſalts, ſuch as the ſal glauberi given at intervals, ſo as to keep up a conſtant action, the diſeaſe was ſometimes brought back from the ſecond ſtage to the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The vitriolic acid was tried frequently without any kind of advantage: it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned an unnatural appetite, and commonly haſtened the progreſs of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The bark, and bitters of every kind, were attended with ſimilar effects.</p>
                  <p>As theſe remedies have been long found to be ineffectual, practitioners of late years have had recourſe to mercury, introducing it to the ſyſtem both by the mouth and ſkin; and by this treatment they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much more ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>Soon after my arrival in India, I ſaw ſeveral caſes treated in this manner with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0059501700:34"/>evident advantage. A hard gum had always been obſerved to be a conſtant attendant on this diſeaſe. I had not ſeen many caſes before I began to obſerve that the patient ſeldom or never was relieved until the gums were made ſore or ſpungy; and when they could not be thus affected, a ſuppuration almoſt always took place. I entertained hope that this ſtate of the gums would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me with a certain criterion, to judge when a ſufficient quantity of mercury was thrown into the ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate of uncertainty, I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to obſerve that a ſmall quantity of mercury, taken by the mouth, affected the gums very much, and often without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any other ſenſible alteration. On the contrary, when a large quantity was applied to the ſkin, the time required to affect the gums was much longer, and the alterations on the ſyſtem were much greater.</p>
                  <p>This obſervation firſt ſugeſted to me the ſuppoſition, that, when the mercury was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0059501700:35"/>introduced by the ſtomach, it might have a tendency to paſs off by the mouth before the ſyſtem was much affected; whereas, when it was introduced by the ſkin, a large quantity could be retained in the ſyſtem before the gums became affected: and therefore, if any advantage was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from mercury in this diſeaſe, this latter method, in which larger quantities could be introduced into the ſyſtem, ought naturally to be preferred.</p>
                  <p>The two following caſes, related to me by the gentlemen themſelves, firſt led me to believe the neceſſity of much mercury in the cure of this diſeaſe.</p>

The dyſenteric ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms diſappeared, but his mouth remained for ſeveral days very troubleſome.

Fourteen drachms of mercurial ointment, applied in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of two drachms a day, removed the dyſentery, without affecting the gums. In about two months the dyſentery recurred, and was again relieved by frictions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued during another week. At the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſix or eight days from this period he was ſuddenly attacked with what he thought to be only a painful crick of the left ſide of the neck. For this complaint recourſe was had to topical applications of opium and volatile liniment, hot flannels, and fotuſes, but without any effect; and, about two hours after, a pain, not leſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0059501700:41"/>violent, was felt about the left hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondre, and extended over the ſtomach.

In compliance with the patient's anxiety, mercury was exhibited by the mouth. A few doſes of calomel produced ulcerations of the gums, but no ſpongineſs, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſymptoms. The mercury was diſcontinued on account of theſe ulcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations about the gums.

                  <p>Being now informed of the ſucceſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the third caſe, I determined, notwithſtanding the exhauſted ſtate of the patient, to puſh the mercury by the ſkin only, until the gums ſhould become af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Half an ounce of the ſtrongeſt mercurial ointment was rubbed in about the back, abdomen, and thighs. Before this friction was completely finiſhed, the patient became ſo much relieved, as to be able to lie at his full length, in any ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation but on the diſeaſed ſide. A drachm of the ointment was continued to be rubbed in, night and morning, with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent good effect; and, after the friction had been repeated twelve times, the gums became uniformly ſpongy. From that time the pain ceaſed, the pulſe became ſofter and ſlower, and the patient ſpeedily returned to a better ſtate of health than he had ever before enjoyed in India. He
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0059501700:43"/>remained more than a year after in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of that country, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any kind of relapſe. His gums remained not very long ſpongy, nor did his ſaliva continue to flow ſo profuſely as in thoſe caſes where the mercury had been taken by the mouth. He is now in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and ſuffers no inconvenience from change of climate</p>
                  <p>This, and the preceding caſe, impreſſed me with an opinion that there was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to avoid exhibiting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury by the mouth when the patient was put under a courſe of frictions.</p>
                  <p>In order to try whether this opinion was well-founded, I procured a large quantity of good mercurial ointment, and proceeded to the cure of a variety of caſes with the frictions, unaſſiſted by any other remedy. I now obſerved, that, by this method, the gums were much ſlower in being affected; but, when they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0059501700:44"/>the diſeaſe appeared to be entirely removed.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the patient was relieved two or three days before the gums were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. But, more frequently, relief was not to be expected till a few hours before the gums became ſpongy; from which time the ſecretions, the appetite, the pulſe, the ſpirits, and the complexion, very ſpeedily became natural. I alſo obſerved, that, where the mercury was given by the ſtomach, the gums, after becoming ſore, remained hard and of a natural colour in many places. In other parts there were troubleſome ulcerations, attended with a copious ſpitting. Whereas, from mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial frictions alone, ulcerations never came on ſuddenly, but were always preceded by ſuch a regular ſwelling and change of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the gums, as to render their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention extremely eaſy. I continued in India nine months after I had adopted this practice. All the confirmed liver caſes (amounting to an immenſe number)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0059501700:45"/>which from that time came under my care, were, by this method, cured without ſuppurations; nor was there any relapſe, ſo far as I could learn, during my ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reſidence in the country.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add the following caſe to thoſe I have already given.</p>

                  <head>CASE V.</head>
                  <p>Lieutenant C. of the Company's ſervice, about twenty-five years of age, had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, after his arrival, which was five years before, in India, laboured under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated attacks of the Hepatitis. Mercurial frictions and pills had conſtantly relieved him, until a few weeks before I ſaw him: he had then gone through his uſual courſe with but little relief, and his mouth had become too ſore to perſiſt in any farther trial of it. As no medical perſon was near him, he had recourſe to repeated doſes of ſalts. His mouth was relieved
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0059501700:46"/>by the ſalts, but his diſeaſe continued. He came under my care about a week after, and was immediately put upon the frictions, with one drachm of mercurial, ointment night and morning. Near three ounces of ointment were uſed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before the gums were affected; they then began to ſwell and aſſume a deep red colour. From this time he enjoyed a total ceſſation of pain, and recovered a better ſtate of health than he had ever before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in that country.</p>
                  <p>After theſe caſes had happened our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment was carried round to Bengal in the Vanſittart Engliſh Indiaman. This ſhip had juſt returned from Batavia; and many of her crew were then labouring under chronic dyſenteries contracted in that ſettlement. I was aſked, by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of the ſhip, to ſee one of the worſt caſes.</p>
                  <p>From what I had then learned of the diſeaſes of the country, I pronounced the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0059501700:47"/>caſe to be a Hepatitis. The ſurgeon could hardly be perſuaded of this, as the man had never complained of pain of the ſhoulder or ſide, nor been ſeized either with vomitings or hiccups. But in two days a large tumor in the region of the right lobe of the liver confirmed my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
                  <p>The tumor was opened, and about three Engliſh pints of matter inſtantly diſcharged from the liver. The man died a few days after the operation. The reſt of the ſick crew were recovered by treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their caſes as diſeaſed livers.</p>
                  <p>After relating ſo many inſtances of the good effefts of mercury, it may be expected that I ſhould offer ſome opinion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its mode of operation. On this ſubject I ſhall be extremely brief.</p>
                  <p>As there are no ſtimuli, that I know of, which can ſupport, for ſo great a length of time, an increaſed action of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0059501700:48"/>vaſcular ſyſtem, I preſume this muſt be the reaſon why mercury has the advantage over all other medicines of that claſs, and may truly be ſaid to poſſeſs very peculiar powers.</p>
                  <p>But mercury, given by the ſtomach, never can be made to keep up that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued action, ſo neceſſary for the cure of this, and perhaps of every other diſeaſe, which has been ſlow in its progreſs.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all I have ſaid of this moſt excellent, though in the end debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating medicine, I am of opinion that it ſhould never be uſed too ſoon; and that, when adopted, it ought to be perſiſted in regularly. The uſe of ſmall doſes of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel, as a prophilactic, I am convinced has often been the means of producing this diſeaſe. I would, therefore, adviſe no perſon to have recourſe to mercury as a preventive, nor ever to begin with it in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe; as, during that period, a change of ſituation and diet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0059501700:49"/>may prove ſufficient to effect the cure. But, in the ſecond ſtage, the frictions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be not only the moſt expedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ious, as well as the moſt ſucceſsful, method of treatment.</p>
                  <p>It may be proper to obſerve that, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mercurial courſe, acids ſhould be avoided; and animal food generally proves the beſt kind of diet. Not leſs than a drachm of the ſtrongeſt ointment ſhould be thoroughly rubbed in, either upon the ſide, or ſome other extenſive ſurface, every night and morning.</p>
                  <p>The mercurial frictions, having relieved or entirely removed the pain, ought not to be diſcontinued until the gums become affected; otherwiſe the patient is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a relapſe, with a greater tendency to ſuppuration.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, towards the concluſion of the mercurial courſe, viz. about the time the gums become affected, a kind of eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipilatous eruption breaks out all over the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0059501700:50"/>body: but, by a diſcontinuance of the mercury, this may be ſoon removed. In other caſes it was obſerved that the ſtools firſt becoming copious after the courſe, were ſometimes mixed with a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of gelatinous matter, which had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the appearance of hydatids. As this ſymptom ſeldom appeared till health was returning, no variation of treatment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Slight pains of the muſcles of the arms, thighs, ſhoulders, and ſide, remain for ſome time after the uſe of mercury; but none of them are attended with any catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in reſpiration, as in the Hepatitis, and deſerve no particular attention. For ſome time after the mercurial courſe, however, the great increaſe of perſpiration, eſpecially about the abdomen, renders it abſolutely neceſſary to keep that part well covered; otherwiſe the hot winds, which blow with ſo much force in that country, are apt to produce violent ſpaſmodic pains of the bowels.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0059501700:51"/>
                  <p>The appetite becomes exceedingly keen after the mercurial courſe, and renders the greateſt precautions neceſſary that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be not overcharged. The dinner ſhould be made of one good diſh of roaſt meat, or cury, without greaſe, with but a very moderate uſe of vegetables or fruit. Two or three glaſſes of wine after dinner are as much as ought to be indulged in for ſome time. Drinking of grog, or any ſpirituous liquors, ſhould not be uſe; and all warm weak drinks ought likewiſe to be avoided. As the few glaſſes of wine after dinner are preſcribed with the view of promoting digeſtion, no other liquid ought to be taken for at leaſt an hour after, that the power of the wine may not be weakened.</p>
                  <p>The mercurial courſe, not unfrequently, produces ſo great a ſecretion of bile as to render the uſe of vegetables and acids almoſt, if not totally, impracticable. This effect ſometimes ariſes to what is called in India a mercurial flux; and may be then
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0059501700:52"/>removed, by abſtaining from all acids and vegetables and adhering a few days entirely to a diet of animal food, with the uſe of ſpirits and water, or Madeira wine. A ſimilar flux happens on firſt arriving in warm climates, which yields to the ſame method of cure, being only a preternatural increaſed ſecretion of bile, occaſioned by the abuſe of acids, fruits, or vegetables. After the Hepatitis is removed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, but cautious, uſe of acids, in hot climates, proves the beſt means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a relapſe.</p>

            <head>ON SPASMODIC AFFECTIONS IN INDIA.</head>
            <p>SPASMS were the firſt diſeaſes which appeared amongſt the troops who arrived at Madras in October 1782, under the command of Major General Sir John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne. More than fifty of theſe freſh men were killed by them within the firſt three days after they were landed in that country, and in leſs than a month from that time, upwards of a thouſand had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from attacks of theſe complaints.</p>
            <p>The teſtanus or ſpaſm is diſtinguiſhed by medical writers into various ſpecies,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0059501700:54"/>according either to the particular parts affected with contraction, or the duration of the diſeaſe. But as all theſe different appearances (at leaſt when not ariſing from wounds) ſeem to proceed from the ſame cauſes, to yield to the ſame method of cure, and to afford nothing particular with reſpeſt to the prognoſis of the diſeaſe, I ſhall, without ſpecifying their diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deſcribe the various phaenomena, as generally obſerved in India.</p>
            <p>I muſt, however, previouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that though I have ſeen man wounds in India, I never ſaw a wounded perſon affected with ſpaſms, except in the agonies of death; and therefore I can by no means affirm that the following obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations are equally applicable to thoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanic affections, which are deſcribed by authors as ariſing from wounds; becauſe ſuch caſes, from their peculiar exciting cauſes, muſt be ſtill more untraceable and hazardous.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0059501700:55"/>
            <p>The ſymptoms which commonly firſt preſented themſelves were coldneſs of the ſurface of the body, eſpecially of the hands; feebleneſs of the pulſe, and ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic contractions of the lower extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meties, ſoon extending to the muſcles of the abdomen, diaphragm, and ribs. As the ſpaſms advanced, the muſcles might be ſeen to aſſume the rigidity of cartilages; ſometimes cauſing the body to remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably extended; ſometimes bending the trunk through its whole length, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly; and ſometimes, though ſeldomer, backwards. The parts in which the ſpaſms began generally remained rigid; but thoſe which were ſubſequently ſeized with them, had momentary intermiſſions of the contractions; the only intervals of relief experienced by the patient from the moſt tormenting pains. The hands and feet then generally became ſodden, with cold ſweats; the nails livid, the pulſe more feeble and frequent, and the breath
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0059501700:56"/>ſo condenſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to be both ſeen and felt, iſſuing in a cold ſtream at a conſiderable diſtance. The thirſt was inſatiable; the tongue whitiſh, but never dry; vomitings became almoſt inceſſant; the ſpaſms, cold ſweats, and thirſt, increaſed with the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings; which laſt, if not checked, ſoon terminated the exiſtence of the patient.</p>
            <p>In this manner, moſt commonly, was the ſucceſſion of phaenomena; but often they were ſo rapid in their attack, that they ſeemed to ſeize the patient all in conjunction inſtantaneouſly.</p>
            <p>In ſome few, the extremities remained warm; in others alſo the ſpaſms were only clonic or convulſive. Some died in the firſt hour of the attack; others lived a day or two with remiſſions; when they died either of univerſal ſpaſms, or an apoplexy. On the diſſection of the bodies after death, it appeared that no injury
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0059501700:57"/>had been ſuſtained by the brain, liver, gall, bladder, ſtomach, or heart.</p>
            <p>All who recovered of this diſeaſe were obſerved to have very languid ſecretions for a conſiderable time after, and frequently carbuncles, which would ſometimes yield neither to bark, opium, nor wine.</p>
            <p>At a general meeting of the faculty at Madras, this diſeaſe was unanimouſly judged to proceed from the four follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſes, viz.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Damps from the earth,</l>
               <l>The not uſing of capſicum,</l>
               <l>Bad arrack,</l>
               <l>A coffee made of ſtramonium.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The facts adduced in ſupport of the firſt of theſe were, that fowls put into coops at night, in that ſeaſon of the year, and on the ſame ſoil that the men ſlept, were always found dead the next morning, if the coop was not placed at a certain
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0059501700:58"/>height above the ſurface of the earth. And as a ſufficient number of cotts had nor been previouſly procured for all the troops, many of them were obliged to ſleep on the ground.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>CAPSICUM.</head>
               <p>As the men had not then learned to eat capſicum with their meat, according to the general practice of Aſia, this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was conſidered as a prediſponent cauſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>A bad kind of arrack, made from ſome of the moſt intoxicating vegetables, is often privately ſold amongſt the ſoldiery, and was therefore conſidered as one probable cauſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the coffee made of ſtramo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, which the natives both ſell and drink themſelves, as the cheapeſt of all modes of intoxication, it muſt be obſerved
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0059501700:59"/>that there were no proofs of any of the men having drank of this coffee.</p>
               <p>Towards aſcertaining the moſt general exciting cauſe of this diſeaſe, I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the following facts.</p>
               <p>Drunkenneſs was very ſeverely puniſhed in all the newly arrived regiments; and to prevent detection the men, after the rolls were called in the evening, uſed to drink ſeven or eight large drams, and go to bed; immediately on awakening, their thirſt was uſually ſo great, that they drank three or four pints of cold water, which ſeldom failed to produce the diſeaſe. The firſt circumſtance which led me to ſuſpect this, and which was afterwards confirmed by the confeſſions of ſeveral of the men who recovered, was my obſerving that all the patients in the worſt caſes were brought into the hoſpital about four o'clock in the morning. They were attacked with the vomitings, and other ſymptoms,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0059501700:60"/>almoſt immediately after they had drank the cold water.</p>
               <p>A muſſulman, in the ſouthern parts of the Tanjore country, having uſed the cold bath immediately after coition, was ſiezed with an univerſal ſpaſm, and died in leſs than half an hour.</p>
               <p>An officer, after being twelve months in India, became my patient, for a large venereal ulcer, which laid bare a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able portion of the urethra. After the ulcer was perfectly healed, and his mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial courſe finiſhed, he expoſed himſelf in his ſleep to a ſtream of air. On waking the next morning he found his jaw ſtiff, but as the day became hot the ſtiffneſs went off. On mentioning it to me, he was deſired to ſleep warmer for the future, on the preſumption that it was occaſioned by an increaſe of perſpiration, and irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from the uſe of mercury. He felt no returns of his complaint until near a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0059501700:61"/>fortnight after, when he was induced by the cloſeneſs and heat, during the firſt part of the night, again to ſet open the doors and windows. The winds blowing very ſtrong towards the morning awaked him, when he found himſelf affected with the moſt dreadful ſpaſms in every part of his body, attended with cold ſweats, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtiffneſs of his extremeties; all which ſymptoms could not be removed for the ſpace of ſixteen hours.</p>
               <p>This, and the caſe of an officer of the Company's ſervice, who, immediately after the fatigue of a very hot day's march, plunged himſelf into a tank of cold water, are the only two caſes of ſpaſms I ever ſaw amongſt officers<note n="*" place="bottom">By officers, however, this diſeaſe is often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the <hi>coup de ſoliel,</hi> or ſun ſtroke, becauſe each, if not attended to, very ſpeedily puts a period to life. In the firſt or mildeſt attacks of the ſun ſtroke, it exhibits the phaenomena of a ſynocha; in the ſecond, thoſe of phrenitis; and in the laſt ſtage, ſomnolency, cold ſweats, and death ſometimes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a few convulſive motions.</note>; though above three
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0059501700:62"/>hundred of the 101ſt private ſoldiers were attacked with them on the firſt month of their arrival at Madras<note n="*" place="bottom">Officers, however, as well as private men, have been ſuddenly killed in that country by ſpaſms, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by expoſing themſelves to the winds, with nothing on but their ſhirts, when wet with perſpiration. This will be very eaſily conceived by thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the common method of cooling liquor in India, by keeping the ſides of the bottles moiſt with wet cloths, and expoſed to the evaporating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the winds.</note>.</p>
               <p>From all theſe circumſtances I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to agree with thoſe authors who have conſidered cold<note n="†" place="bottom">By this expreſſion I mean relative, not abſolute cold. I ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uld not have thought this explanation neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as poſitive cold is now ſcarcely by any admitted in this country, had I not been informed that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious gentleman recommends an ice-houſe for the cure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>is diſeaſe, becauſe it is an endemic of the torrid climates. A gentleman who arrived in India with a ſimilar ſpeculative opinion, enjoined the uſe of the cold bath in a number of tetanic caſes; and had the mortification to find that, in all, he accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the death of the patients ſo quickly, that ſcarce any of them could ſurvive two minutes alter coming out of the bath. The irritability of the body is very ſenſibly increaſed on the firſt expoſure to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a hot climate. Until that increaſed irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability be considerably diminiſhed, a perſon is unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and remains too weak to bear with ſafety the meridian heat, or evening dew; neither can he ſafely take medicines in equal doſes with thoſe who are ſeaſoned to a hot climate.</note> as the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exciting cauſe of this diſeaſe.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0059501700:63"/>
               <p>The prognoſis of this diſeaſe is formed with greater certainty from the warmth or coldneſs of the extremeties, than from either the univerſality of the ſpaſms, or the frequency or ſteadineſs of the pulſe. Thus if the ſpaſms were ever ſo general, with warmth of the extremeties, there was no immediate danger: on the contrary, if the ſpaſm was ever ſo trifling, with cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there was every danger to be feared.</p>
               <p>The warm bath, and wrapping up in blankets, with the uſe of opium, were what I at firſt chiefly depended upon in the cure of this diſeaſe. But what the faculty
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0059501700:64"/>there relied on moſt, was the liberal uſe of hot Madeira wine.</p>
               <p>If one bottle ſhould be thrown up, as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt as it was drank, they recommended a ſecond and third bottle. But this practice is not very ſucceſsful: for; in the worſt caſes, the reachings are the moſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>treſſing ſymptoms; as the cold ſweats and ſpaſms are conſtantly obſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with them. And though the thirſt be always inſatiable, yet to allow no more than half an ounce of ſome warm liquid at a time, and that of the moſt cordial kind, with thirty or forty drops of laudanum, proved a more ſucceſsful plan than indulging the patient in a full draught. This cordial and laudanum I uſed to repeat as faſt as it was thrown up. But when the patient retained a doſe, I repeated the cordial, without the opium, but in the ſame ſmall quantities, and at intervals. For a draught of any liquid was ſure to make the vomitings recur, and with them the cold ſweats, thirſt, and ſpaſms.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0059501700:65"/>
               <p>Afterwards, being in a ſituation where the warm bath could not be had recourſe to, and being then ſatisfied by my own obſervations, by the teſtimony of many of the faculty at Madras, and by the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The practice of the natives in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is to uſe frictions, and hot dry ſand,

               <p>A Dutch phyſician in that country is ſaid to have been always very ſucceſsful in this diſeaſe, by treating it in the following manner: to ſtrip the patient, lay him on a cane couch, under which were placed ſtoves of fire; to cover the trunk and limbs from the air with a blanket, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the heat from the ſtoves ſhould be confined about the body; to have fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the ſame time uſed under the blankets, with warm flannel<note n="*" place="bottom">A to giving opium in a ſolid form, either in this diſeaſe or cholera mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As I never had any caſes of ſpaſms after learning this method, I never had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of giving it a trial.</p>
