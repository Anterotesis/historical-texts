            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <note place="margin">The climate and ſoil of India,</note>GOVERNMENT derives its form from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; its ſpirit and genius from the inherent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners  of the people. The languor occaſioned by the hot climate of India, inclines the native to indolence and eaſe; and he thinks the evils of deſpotiſm leſs ſevere than the labour of being free. Tranquillity is the chief object of his deſires. His happineſs conſiſts in a mere abſence of miſery; and oppreſſion muſt degenerate into a folly, which defeats its own ends before he calls it by the name of injuſtice. Theſe phlegmatic ſentiments the Indian
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0828300200:5"/>
carries into his future ſtate. He thinks it a mode of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which paſſion is loſt, and every faculty of the ſoul ſuſpended, except the conſciouſneſs of exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">favourable to deſpotiſm.</note>Other motives of paſſive obedience join iſſue with the love of eaſe. The ſun, which enervates his body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces  for him, in a manner ſpontaneouſly, the various fruits of the earth. He finds ſubſiſtence without much toil; he requires little covering but the ſhade. The chill blaſt of winter is unknown; the ſeaſons are only marked by an arbitrary number of nights and days. Property being in ſome meaſure unneceſſary, becomes of little value; and men ſubmit, without reſiſtance, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of right, which may hurt but cannot deſtroy them. Their religious inſtitutions incline them to peace and ſubmiſſion. The vulgar live with the auſterity of philoſophers, as well as with the abſtinence of devotees. Averſe themſelves to the commiſſion of crimes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent no injuries from others; and their low diet cools their temper to a degree which paſſion cannot inflame.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Encourage conqueſt.</note>The fertility of the ſoil, which in other kingdoms conſtitutes the great proſperity of the natives, was a  ſource of misfortune to the Indians. Notwithſtanding their abſtinence and indolence, they were in ſome degree induſtrious, and, in want of but few things themſelves,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0828300200:6"/>
their own arts, and the natural productions of their country, rendered them opulent. Wealth accumulated, in the progreſs of time, upon their hands; and they became objects of depredation to the fierce nations of the northern Aſia. The facility of incurſion, among a peaceable and harmleſs race of men, encouraged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The victors, inſtead of carrying the ſpoil into their native country, ſat down where it had been found; and added the miniſtration of the conquered to the other enjoyments of wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Aſia always the ſeat of ſlavery.</note>Aſia, the ſeat of the greateſt empires, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways  the nurſe of the moſt abject ſlaves. The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Perſia have not been able to ſtop the progreſs of the tide of deſpotiſm; neither has it been frozen in its courſe through the plains of the northern Tartary, by the chill air of the North. But though deſpotiſm go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns Aſia, it appears in different countries under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious forms. The Arabs of the deſart alone poſſeſs liberty, on account of the ſterility of their ſoil. Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of revolution and change, they ſee, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern, empires falling and riſing around. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unconquered by arms, by luxury, by corruption; they alter not their language, they adhere to their cuſtoms and manners, they retain their dreſs. Their whole property conſiſts of flocks and herds, of their
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0828300200:7"/>
tents and arms. They annually make a ſmall and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary preſent to the chief of their blood. They revolt againſt oppreſſion; and they are free by neceſſity, which they miſtake for choice. When men are obliged to wander for ſubſiſtance, deſpotiſm knows not where to find its ſlaves.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nature of the Tartar</note>The Tartar, though a wanderer like the Arab, was  never equally free. A violent ariſtocracy always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the country of the former, except in a few ſhort periods, when the fortune of one eſtabliſhed a tranſient deſpotiſm over the whole. There man is armed againſt man, chief againſt chief, and tribe againſt tribe. War is no longer a particular profeſſion, but the conſtant occupation of all. Men are more afraid of men in the ſolitudes of Tartary, than of beaſts of prey. The traveller moves with great circumſpection, and hears an enemy in every blaſt of wind. When he ſees a tract in the ſand, he croſſes it, and begins to draw his ſword. Though the barrenneſs of the country has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the growth or introduction of luxury, avarice prevails, and he that has the leaſt to loſe is the moſt independent, where life is invariably riſqued for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ſpoil. Robbery acquires the more honourable name of Conqueſt; and the aſſaſſin is dignified with the title of Warrior.</p>

               <note place="margin">and Afgan ariſtoeracies.</note>In the mountains which ſeparate Perſia from India,  the nature and face of the country have formed a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies of ſociety. Every valley contains a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ſubject to a prince, whoſe deſpotiſm is tempered, by an idea eſtabliſhed among his people, that he is the chief of their blood, as well as their ſovereign. They obey him without reluctance, as they derive credit to their family from his greatneſs. They attend him in his wars, with the attachment which children have for a parent; and his government, though ſevere, partakes more of the rigid diſcipline of a general, than of the caprice of a deſpot. Rude as the face of their country, and fierce and wild as the ſtorms which cover their mountains, they love incurſion and depredation, and delight in plunder and in battle. United firmly to their friends in war, to their enemies faithleſs and cruel. They place juſtice in force, and conceal treachery under the name of addreſs. Such are the Afgans or Patans, who conquered India and held it for ages.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Deſpotiſm of the Patans different</note>The deſpotiſm which the Patans eſtabliſhed in their  conqueſts, partook of the violence of their national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter at home. Their government was oppreſſive through pride, and tyrannical from paſſion rather than from avarice. Reinforced by ſucceſſive migrations from the mountains of Afganiſtân, they retained their native

ſpirit in the midſt of the luxuries of India. When the monarch became voluptuous and degenerate, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his place with ſome hardy chieftain from the north, who communicated his own vigour to the great machine of the ſtate. The empire was ſupported by a ſucceſſion of abilities, rather than by an hereditary ſucceſſion of princes; and it was the countrymen, and not the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the firſt conquerors, who continued the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Patâns over India.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">from that of the Moguls.</note>The conqueſt of India by the family of Timur, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded  from the abilities of one man, and not from the effort of a nation. Baber himſelf was a ſtranger in the country in which he reigned, before he penetrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Indus. His troops conſiſted of ſoldiers of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, from various countries; his officers were men who owed their rank to merit, not to ſucceſſion. The religion of Mahommed, which they in common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and their obedience to one leader, were the only ties which united the conquerors upon their arrival; and they were ſoon diſſipated in the extenſive dominions which their arms ſubdued. The character of the prince went down on the current of government; and the mild diſpoſition of his ſucceſſors contributed to confirm the humane deſpotiſm which he had introduced into his conqueſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0828300200:10"/>
               <note place="margin">Cauſe of that difference,</note>A continued influx of ſtrangers from the northern  Aſia, became neceſſary for the ſupport of princes who profeſſed a different faith with their ſubjects, in the vaſt empire of India. The army was recruited with ſoldiers from different nations; the court was occupied by nobles from various kingdoms. The latter were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Mahommedan religion. In the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſpirit of the Coran, they loſt their primary and characteriſtical ideas upon government; and the whole ſyſtem was formed and enlivened by the limited principles which Mahommed promulgated in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of Arabia.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">from their religion.</note>The faith of Mahommed is peculiarly calculated for  deſpotiſm; and it is one of the greateſt cauſes which muſt fix for ever the duration of that ſpecies of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Eaſt. The legiſlator furniſhes a proof of this poſition in his own conduct. He derived his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from the ſword, more than from his eloquence and addreſs. The tyranny which he eſtabliſhed was of the moſt extenſive kind. He enſlaved the mind as well as the body. The abrupt argument of the ſword brought conviction, when perſuaſion and deluſion failed. He ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a revolution and change in the human mind, as well as in ſtates and empires; and the ambitious will continue to ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

on the paſſive obedience of thoſe whom Fortune has once placed beneath their power.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Deſpotiſm</note>The unlimited power which Mahommedaniſm gives  to every man in his own family, habituates mankind to ſlavery. Every child is taught, from his infancy, to look upon his father as the abſolute diſpoſer of life and death. The number of wives and concubines which the more wealthy and powerful entertain, is a cauſe of animoſity and quarrel, which nothing but a ſevere and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power in the maſter of a family can repreſs. This private ſpecies of deſpotiſm is, in miniature, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of what prevails in the ſtate; and it has the ſame effect, in reducing all the paſſions under the dominion of fear. Jealouſy itſelf, that moſt violent of the feelings of the ſoul, is curbed within the walls of the haram. The women may pine in ſecret, but they muſt clothe their features with cheerfulneſs when their lord appears. Contumacy is productive of immediate puniſhment. They are degraded, divorced, chaſtiſed, and even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put to death, according to the degree of their crime or obſtinacy, or the wrath of the offended huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. No enquiry is made concerning their fate. Their friends may murmur; but the laws provide no redreſs; for no appeals to public juſtice iſſue forth from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</p>

               <note place="margin">of the maſters of families.</note>Young men, with their minds moulded to ſubjection,  become themſelves maſters of families in the courſe of time. Their power being confined within their own walls, they exerciſe in private, that deſpotiſm which they in public dread. But though they are freed from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic tyranny, they ſtill continue ſlaves. Governors, magiſtrates, and inferior officers, inveſted with the power of the principal deſpot, whoſe will is law to the empire, exerciſe their authority with rigour. The idea of paſſive obedience is carried through every vein of the ſtate. The machine connected in all its parts, by arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſway, is moved by the active ſpirit of the prince; and the lenity or oppreſſiveneſs of government, in all its departments depends upon the natural diſpoſition of his mind.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Law of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for murder.</note>The law of compenſation for murder, authoriſed by  the Coran, is attended with pernicious effects. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the ſpirit of the poor; and encourages the rich in the unmanly paſſion of revenge. The price of blood in India is not the third part of the value of a horſe. The innate principles of juſtice and humanity are weakened, by theſe means; ſecurity is taken from ſociety, as rage may frequently get the better of the love of money. A religion which indulges individuals in a crime, at which the reſt of mankind ſhudder, leaves ample room for the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0828300200:13"/>
cruelty of a prince. Accuſtomed to ſit in judgment on criminals, he becomes habituated to death. He miſtakes paſſion for juſtice. His nod is condemnation; men are dragged to execution, with an abruptneſs which prevents fear. The incident has no conſequence, but to impreſs terror on the guilty or ſuſpected; and the ſpectators ſcarcely heed a circumſtance, which its frequency has made them to expect.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bathing.</note>The frequent bathing inculcated by the Coran, has,  by debilitating the body, a great effect on the mind. Habit makes the warm bath a luxury of a bewitching kind. The women ſpend whole days in water; and haſten by it the approach of age. The indolence of the men, which induces them to follow every mode of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid pleaſure, recommends to them a practice which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed has made a tenet of religion. The prohibition of wine is alſo favourable to deſpotiſm. It prevents that free communication of ſentiment which awakens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from a torpid indifference to their natural rights. They become cold, timid, cautious, reſerved and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted; ſtrangers to thoſe warm paſſions, and that cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful elevation of mind, which render men in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure honeſt and ſincere. In the Eaſt, there are no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places of meeting, no communications of ſentiments, no introduction to private friendſhip. A fullenneſs, and
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0828300200:14"/>

and hurries them forward in a few years to age. One man retains his vigour beyond the common ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of three women through their prime; and the law for a multiplicity of wives is neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the human race. But the cuſtom weakens pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection; for as a huſband cannot equally divide his regard among many women, the children of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite will be preferred. Even theſe will not be much beloved. The loſs of a child is no misfortune; and the care of preſerving it is leſſened, by the opportunity which the number of his women furniſhes to the father for begetting more. The child himſelf is no ſtranger to this indifference; and he fails in proportion in his duty. Beſides, the jealouſy between mothers in the haram grows into hatred among their ſons. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection between brothers is annihilated at home; and when they iſſue forth into the world, they carry their animoſities into all the various tranſactions of life.</p>

His affection for the woman is not the pledge of his fidelity; but his honour is, in her perſon, in the cuſtody of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.

Men indulge themſelves under the veil of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; and rejoice in their good fortune, when their pleaſures can eſcape the eye of their prince. Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs is, therefore, preferred to luxury. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the company of women is the chief object of life among the great; and when they retire into the ſanctuary of the haram, they forget, in a variety of charms, their precarious ſituation in the ſtate. The neceſſary privacy enhances the indulgence; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſenſibility, perhaps, peculiar to the natives of a hot climate, carries pleaſure to an exceſs which unmans the mind.

as has been obſerved, reared to perfect growth by the Mahommedan faith. When a people have been long ſubjected to arbitrary power, their return to liberty is arduous and almoſt impoſſible. Slavery, by the ſtrength of cuſtom, is blended with human nature; and that undefined ſomething, called Public Virtue, exiſts no more. The ſubject never thinks of reformation; and the prince, who only has it in his power, will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no innovations to abridge his own authority. Were even the deſpot poſſeſſed of the enthuſiaſm of public ſpirit, the people would revolt againſt the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of freedom; and revert to that form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which takes the trouble of regulation from their hands.</p>

               <note place="margin">on the nature</note>The ſimplicity of deſpotiſm recommends it to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent  and ignorant race of men. Its obvious impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, its prompt juſtice, its immediate ſeverity againſt crimes, dazzle the eyes of the ſuperficial, and raiſe in their minds a veneration little ſhort of idolatry for their prince. When he is active and determined in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the great machine moves with a velocity which throws vigour into the very extremities of the empire. His violence, and even his caprices, are virtues, where the waters muſt be always agitated to preſerve their freſhneſs; and indolence and irreſolution can be his
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0828300200:19"/>
only ruinous vices. The firſt indeed may injure the ſtate; but by the latter it muſt be undone. A ſevere prince, by his jealouſy of his own authority, prevents the tyranny of others; and, though fierce and arbitrary in himſelf, the ſubject derives a benefit from his being the ſole deſpot.

Though no civil regulation can bind the prince, there is one great law, the ideas of mankind with regard to right and wrong, by which he is bound. When he becomes an aſſaſſin, he teaches others to uſe the dagger againſt himſelf; and wanton acts of injuſtice, often repeated, deſtroy by degrees that opinion which is the ſole ſoundation of his power. In the indifference of his ſubjects for his perſon and government, he becomes liable to the conſpiracies of courtiers, and the ambitious ſchemes of his relations. He may have many ſlaves, but he can have no friends. His perſon is expoſed to injury. A certainty of impunity may arm even cowards againſt him; and thus, by his exceſſive ardour for power, he with his authority loſes his life.</p>

He came with an intention to govern the nations whom he ſubdued; and ſelfiſh motives joined iſſue with humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in not only ſparing, but protecting the vanquiſhed. His invaſion was no abrupt incurſion for plunder; and he thought the uſual income of the crown a ſufficient reward for his toil. His nobles were gratified with the emoluments of government; and, from diſpoſition, an enemy to uſeleſs pomp and grandeur, he choſe that his treaſury ſhould be gradually filled with the ſurplus of the revenue, than with the property of individuals, whom the fortune of war had placed beneath his power. Awed by his high character, the companions of his victories carried his mildneſs and ſtrict equity through all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of government.

The offences of the firſt rank of nobility came under the cognizance of this council, as well as other matters of ſtate. They were a kind of jury, who found the matters of fact, and the ſovereign pronounced the ſentence.

A certain portion of the revenue was remitted to court; and the deputy, in a venal court, found frequently means to retain the favour of his prince, when he diſobeyed his commands. Every idea of loyalty was, towards the decline of the empire, deſtroyed among the people of the diſtant provinces. They heard of an emperor, as the ſuperſtitious hear of a guardian angel, whom they never behold. An indifference for his fate ſucceeded to his want of power. A peaſant, at the end of many months, was informed of a revolution

They became a ſecurity to the people againſt the impoſitions of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. An appeal lay from his deciſions, by a petition to the emperor in the hall of audience. This doctrine was inculcated by the edicts; and ſome of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed took advantage of the promiſe of juſtice which they contained. Their petitions, whenever they found acceſs to the throne, were heard with the attention which a jealous prince pays to his own power; and there are many inſtances in which the governors of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces have been ſeverely puniſhed for an act of injuſtice to a poor peaſant.

Perſonal abilities, under ſuch a ſyſtem, are more neceſſary than under eſtabliſhed laws. A weak prince brings more calamities than a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil war. A minority is dreadful; and it can ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, where the voice of the prince is the living law, which moves the whole machine of the ſtate.</p>

Some of the reigning princes trace their families, with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, above four thouſand years; many of them, in a dubious manner, from the dark period which we place beyond the flood.

Their governors encourage induſtry and commerce; and it is to the ingenuity of the Hindoos, we owe all the fine manufactures in the Eaſt.

Facts coming from afar made little impreſſion: their novelty could not rouze, nor their variety amuſe the mind. With a ſelf-denial uncommon in a ſpirited nation, we heard, without emotion, of the great actions of ſome of our countrymen; and, if we liſtened to any detail of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

                     <note place="margin">Deſign of the author.</note>The current of public opinion has, at length, taken  another direction. Men are rouzed into attention, with regard to a ſubject which concerns the welfare of the ſtate. They begin to decide, in their own minds, upon affairs which ſtand in need of the interpoſition of the nation; and they ſhew an inclination to be informed, as well as a willingneſs to correct miſtakes and to redreſs grievances. This conſideration has induced the author of the following obſervations, to ſubmit them, with all due deference, to the public. He has been, for years, a ſilent ſpectator of the tranſactions of the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Eaſt; and it is, from the means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he has poſſeſſed, that he hopes to give ſomething new to the world.

<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:0828300200:37"/>
to the 170th year before the Chriſtian aera, when it was diſſolved by civil diſcord and war. Bengal, like many other provinces, ſtarted up into an independent king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and was governed by ſucceſſive dynaſties of Rajas, who chiefly reſided at the now deſerted capital of Ghor. Under theſe princes, it continued a powerful and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kingdom, to the beginning of the thirteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, when it was firſt invaded by the Mahommedans, under a prince of the race of Chillagi, who poſſeſſed the countries near the ſource of the Oxus. The name of this Tartar invader was Eas-ul-dien; but he was ſoon after reduced to ſubjection by Altumſh, the Patan em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Delhi, who formed Bengal into a province, governed by a lieutenant, who derived his authority from the conqueror.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">of the various revolutions</note>Bengal, during the dominion of the Patans in India, was frequently ſubject to revolution and change. When  a prince of abilities ſat on the throne of Delhi, it held of the empire; when the emperor was weak, it became an independent ſovereignty under its governor. When the valour and conduct of Baber put an end to the government of the Patans at Delhi, ſome of that race remained untouched in Bengal. The misfortunes of Humaioon, in the beginning of his reign, not only prevented him from extending the conqueſts of his ſather, but deprived him even of the throne which Baber
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:0828300200:38"/>
had acquired; and death followed too ſoon, upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, to permit him to reduce the wealthy kingdom of Bengal by his arms. The glory of this conqueſt was reſerved for his ſon, the illuſtrious Akbar, who, by the expulſion of Daoôd, the laſt king of Bengal of the Patan race, annexed it in the year 1574 to his empire. Viceroys from Delhi governed the kingdom, from that period, till the debility of Mahommed Shaw gave ſcope to the uſurpation of Aliverdi; and now, by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful revolution of ſortune, the ſovereigns of that diſtant province are created by the deputies of the Eaſt India company.</p>

To impoſe nothing merely ſpeculative upon the public, the Writer of the Diſſertation has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to derive his information from undoubted authority. He has, therefore, tranſlated and annexed to his work, the commiſſions granted by the court of Delhi to its principal officers in the provinces: From which it will appear, that the deſpotiſm of the houſe of Timur was circumſcribed by eſtabliſhed forms and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, which greatly tempered the rigid ſeverity of that form of government.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Policy of the Moguls.</note>THE Mogul Tartars, when they conquered India, carried a ſyſtem of neceſſary policy through the countries which their arms had ſubdued. Inſtead  of ſeizing the lands of the vanquiſhed, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them in their poſſeſſions. The number of the conquerors bearing no proportion to the conquered, ſelf-preſervation obliged the firſt to adhere together, and to hold the ſword in their hands. Had they attempted to ſettle in different provinces, they would have ſoon ceaſed to be a people; and their power would have been broken by ſeparation. They retained, therefore, their military character; and, when they reduced a province, they made the taxes paid to former princes, the invariable rule of their impoſts. The people changed their lords, but if their government ſuffered any change, it was in the ſubſtitution of a milder deſpotiſm, in the place of the fierce tyranny of the Patans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Tributary Rajas.</note>Many of the Rajas, or indigenous Indian princes, had,  from the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Mahommedans in India, been permitted to retain a great part of their ancient poſſeſſions, which they continued to govern by their own laws, without any appeal from their juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:0828300200:40"/>
to the courts of juſtice eſtabliſhed by Imperial commiſſions. The only mark of homage paid by the Rajas, was a certain annual tribute. The houſe of Timur, no leſs remarkable for their prudence than for their clemency and juſtice, never encroached upon the privileges of the tributary princes. They found, that though the Rajas paid not to the crown above half the ſum raiſed upon the ſubject, their policy, induſtry, and good government, were ſo much ſuperior to thoſe of the Moguls, that the countries which they poſſeſſed, yielded as much in proportion to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as thoſe which they had farmed out to Zemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of their own nation and faith. In the two provinces which the Britiſh nation now poſſeſs, and which, for the future, we will diſtinguiſh by the general name of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, many diſtricts of greater extent than any county in Britain, are ſtill poſſeſſed by the aboriginal Rajas. But we are more rigid than the Moguls: we have encroached on their privileges, and annihilated their power. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the domination of the houſe of Timur, one fourth of Bengal was ſubject to theſe hereditary lords.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Mahomme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan Zemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars.</note>The diviſion of the province which was more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately  under the Mahommedan government, was parcelled out into extenſive diſtricts, called Chucklas, reſembling, in ſome meaſure, our counties, into leſſer
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:0828300200:41"/>
diviſions, like our ancient tithings. Theſe were lett to Zemindars, or farmers of the Imperial rents, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times poſſeſſed a whole diſtrict, or Chuckla; as the Zemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar of Purnea, who aſſumed the ſtyle and ſtate of a Nabob, though only a farmer of the revenue, under the unfortunate Surage-ul-Dowla. The court of Delhi, under the beſt princes, was venal. A ſum of money, ſecretly and properly applied, oſten ſecured the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his office to the Zemindar during life; and he even was ſometimes enabled to tranſmit it to his heirs, till, by length of time, they were, in ſome meaſure, conſidered as lords of their reſpective diſtricts.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Their power</note>The farmers, however, had no leaſe from the crown of the lands over which they preſided. Their authority  for collecting the rents from the inferior tenants, was derived from a written agreement, for a certain annual ſum to be paid to the treaſury, excluſive of the Imperial taxes. To prevent impoſition on the poorer ſort, in every diſtrict there was eſtabliſhed a regiſter, in which the rents and impoſts upon every village and farm were entered, and open to the inſpection of all. The regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered rents and impoſts were collected by the Crorie of the diſtrict, who was eſtabliſhed in his office by an Imperial commiſſion. He was accountable for the whole, even to the laſt Dâm, as the commiſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, to the Fotadâr or treaſurer of the diſtrict, who

Theſe were, from time to time, permitted to raiſe the rents upon the inferior tenants, in proportion to the general improvement of the lands. The ſurplus, which was known to government from the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters of the diſtricts, was, in part, allowed to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſarmers, for the purpoſe of building houſes for the huſbandmen, for furniſhing them with implements of agriculture, for embanking to prevent inundations, for making reſervoirs of water for the dry ſeaſon; and, in general, for all expences attending the improvement and cultivation of the lands; which otherwiſe would have rendered the accounts of government intricate and perplexed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">by the crown.</note>The great farmers, however, were not permitted to  oppreſs the tenants with exorbitant rents; neither was it their intereſt to extort from the huſbandmen ſums which would render them incapable of cultivating their lands, and of living comfortably upon the fruits of their toil. In the Imperial officers of the revenue, the poor
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:0828300200:43"/>
had friends, and the Zemindar ſpies upon his conduct. They were ſuch checks upon him, that he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal nothing from their obſervation. They tranſmitted monthly accounts of his tranſactions to court. If the tenants were able, without oppreſſion, to pay the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional rent, the demands of the crown roſe at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the year upon the farmer, in proportion to the new impoſt; if they were found incapable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burden, the Zemindar was turned out of his office for his avarice and imprudence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A double revenue.</note>A double revenue, it appears from what has been  already obſerved, roſe to the crown from the lands; the ancient rent, eſtabliſhed at the conqueſt of India by the Moguls, and the ſums which proceeded from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual contracts with the great farmers. The viceroy of the province was veſted with the power of letting the lands; and he was obliged to tranſmit to the receiver-general a record of the ſums payable by each Zemindar. The cauſe of this mode of raiſing the revenue is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. The detail of accounts, the making of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts with the inferior tenants, would have rendered the buſineſs of government too minute and too expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and to have permitted the general farmers to manage their diſtricts without either check or controul, would have given birth to ſcenes of oppreſſion,

Men, who poſſeſſed eſtates for life, and ſometimes in perpetuity, free from all taxation, by virtue of Imperial grants, were diſtinguiſhed by the ſame title. Theſe grants were generally given to learned and religious men, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſervants at court, to ſoldiers who had deſerved well of their prince, and they were reſpected by ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emperors, and ſeldom revoked. One ſixth part of the lands in Bengal had been conferred, in perpetuity, by different princes, on their favourites and adherents. Many of theſe eſtates have fallen into the Eaſt India Company, from a failure of heirs; and others daily fall, as the property is not transferable by ſale. A minute enquiry might greatly increaſe our revenue. Many grants ſaid to be derived from the emperor, are only from the governors of the province; many are in the poſſeſſion of men who cannot trace their blood to the original proprietors. A ſucceſſion of revolutions has rolled one part of Bengal upon the other; and it is not hitherto ſettled from confuſion.</p>

This, however, was nothing more than an aſſignment on the revenues of the crown, ariſing from a ſpecified tract of land in a diſtrict, named in the body of the grant. The grantee had no buſineſs with the tenants, as he never reſided on the eſtate allotted for his ſubſiſtence. He ſent his agent every ſeaſon to the public officers of the diſtrict; and his receipt to them, for his allowance, was received by the Dewan, as a part of the Imperial revenue. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of ſervice, none for the maintenance of troops, was annexed to this grant. Theſe are the fables of men who carried the feudal ideas of Europe into their relation of the ſtate of India. The armies of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were paid out of the public treaſury.

This ſpecies of property was repeatedly ſecured by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral edicts, for the encouragement of building, for the accommodation of citizens, and the improvement of towns. Grants of this kind did not always proceed from the crown.

The exact ſum tranſmitted annually to Delhi, before the diſſolution of the empire, is not eaſy to aſcertain; but we can form ſome judgment of the amount, from the ruinous policy of the Imperial court, when its ancient vigour began to decline.

The country profited, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by the refractorineſs of its governor; if his avarice prompted him to raiſe more on the ſubject, the latter was more able than before to pay the additional impoſt, from the revenue being kept and expended in the province.

Many now in Britain were eye-witneſſes of the truth of this aſſertion. We appeal to the teſtimony of thoſe who marched through Bengal after the death of Surage-ul-Dowla, that, at that time, it was one of the richeſt, moſt populous, and beſt cultivated kingdoms in the world. The great men and merchants were wallowing in wealth

A noble governor ſent to command in Bengal, by the Eaſt India Company, arrived in that kingdom in the May of 1765. The expulſion of the Nabob Caſſim Ali, and the reduction of Suja-ul-Dowla, by our arms, had enabled the ſervants of the Company to eſtabliſh peace upon their own terms.

A perpetual commiſſion for the office of Dewan, or receiver-general of the revenues of Bengal, Behâr, and Oriſſa was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, from SHAW ALLUM, for the Company.

The annuity was moderate to the lineal ſucceſſor of Timur. He was, at the ſame time, guaranteed in the poſſeſſion of the province of Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habâd; and thus a kind of proviſion was made for a prince, who retained nothing of what belonged to his illuſtrious anceſtors, except the empty title of emperor of Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan. This treaty, however, though it dazzled with its ſplendor, was neither ſolid nor advantageous in itſelf. The emperor, inſtead of being placed at Allahabâd, ought to poſſeſs the province, out of which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended viſier Suja-ul-Dowla, had been recently driven; or ſhould that meaſure be ſuppoſed to inveſt him with dangerous power, the territories of Bulwant Singh, equal in revenue to Allahabâd, might have been conferred

The merchants, who formerly came down toward the mouths of the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to purchaſe commodities, have diſcontinued a trade, not only ruined by impoſts, but even unſafe from banditti.

We may venture to affirm, upon the whole, that the balance in favour of Bengal, from all its Aſiatic commerce, exceeds not annually one hundred thouſand pounds. The council of Calcutta have calculated it at leſs than half that ſum. They eſtimated, in the year 1768, the importation of bullion into Bengal, for the ſpace of four years, at fifteen lacks of roupees; which amounts annually to forty-ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds of our money.

Salt is produced by filtrating the earth near the mouths of the Ganges, and by then boiling the water which is impregnated with ſaline particles. The proceſs is ſimple and cheap, where wood for fuel coſts nothing. The low price at which ſalt could be conveyed through all the branches of the Ganges, rendered it an advantageous article of trade with the inland ports of Hindoſtan. Great quantities were ſent to Benâris and Mirzapour, from the markets of which, the provinces of Oud and Allahabâd, the territories of the Raja of Bundela, and of all the petty princes of the kingdom of Malava, were ſupplied. This trade, by a ſociety of Monopoliſts in Calcutta, was ſeized in the year 1765. Avarice got the better of prudence; and a rage for preſent gain cut off all future proſpects.

It would be endleſs to trace the intrigues of the farmers upon this occaſion: it would be difficult to expoſe all the artful villany of the miniſter. The Zemindars, however wealthy they may be, feign ſuch poverty, as not to be able to make up the balances of the preceding year. They have even been known to carry the farce ſo far, as to ſuffer a ſevere whipping before they would produce their money.</p>

When  they ſeem rich, the impoſt is raiſed; and the bribe muſt in proportion be greater. Their love of money is often more powerful than the fear of bodily pain. When they have long groaned under the laſh, ſome banker or money-broker appears, who, for the exorbitant intereſt of ten per cent. per month, diſcharges the debt. The farmer, by ſuch means as theſe, often deceives the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the miniſter and reſident, and obtains his lands for another year, becauſe no one elſe will offer a ſum which the poſſeſſor finds ſo much difficulty to pay. A friend, in the ſecret, gives ſecurity for the rents;

                     <note place="margin">collecting the revenue.</note>In the year 1767, the Author of the Enquiry, who reſided, at the time, in Bengal, had the curioſity to  calculate the expence of the Bundubuſt, or yearly ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He formed his eſtimate from the accounts of various Zemindars, and he avers, without exaggeration, that the expences amounted to twenty-ſeven and one-half per cent. of the rents of their lands; which may amount to a million ſterling. Theſe trivial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites were ſhared between Mahommed Riza, his friends, and the bankers of Murſhedabâd. The place of the Company's reſident at the Durbâr, or the court of the Nabob, was HONESTLY worth one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds a-year.</p>

Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the uncertainty of their ſituation, they raiſed the rents, to the laſt farthing, on the wretched te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; who, unwilling to forſake their ancient habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and houſehold gods, ſubmitted to impoſitions which they could not pay.

Year after year brought new tyrants, or confirmed the old, in the practice of their former oppreſſions.

Their cruelty to their inferiors recoiled, at length, on themſelves. Many of them were bound to ſtakes and whipped; but their poverty ceaſed to be feigned.

Many of the inferior tenants, reduced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, fled the country, hoping to derive from other deſpotiſms, that lenity, which our indolence, to ſpeak the beſt of ourſelves, denied. Thoſe that remained were deprived of the ſmall ſtock neceſſary for cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a great part of the lands lay waſte.

The frauds and oppreſſions committed in Bengal, in the collection of the revenue, are as various as they are without number. The interior policy ſubſiſting in that kingdom, will throw new light on the ſubject. Some of the lands in Bengal go under the deſignation of Comâr, having no native tenants, being cultivated by vagrant huſbandmen, who wander from place to place in queſt of labour. A farmer takes frequently large tracts of theſe lands upon contract. He obliges himſelf to be anſwerable to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for the produce; but he keeps the accounts himſelf. The vagrant huſbandmen whom he employs, having neither implements of agriculture nor ſtock, are, from time to time, ſupplied with ſmall ſums by the farmer, and, when the harveſt is gathered in, he appropriates to himſelf two thirds of the crop; after paying himſelf from the remainder, for the intereſt of the ſums advanced to the vagrants. The accounts delivered in to government
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:0828300200:98"/>

Stewards are appointed to ſuperintend them, without the power of making new contracts with the tenants, or of raiſing upon them the rents, being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only for the rents of the lands, as they ſtand upon the rolls of the diſtrict. Theſe rolls, however, are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral falſe and defective.

The Sicca roupee, as the coin is called, continues to circulate, at the above value, till towards the latter end of the firſt year.

This gain of two per centum is intended as an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bring in the ſilver, that the government may have an opportunity, every year, of robbing the public of three per centum upon the greater part of their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpecie.

To increaſe the revenues was the point to which their ſervants invariably directed their attention; but the means employed defeated their views, and became ruinous to a people whom their arms had ſubdued.

The tranſitory acquiſition, upon the opinion that all the ſpecie of Bengal had centered in Great Britain, would have no deſirable effect. The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive wealth would glide through our hands; and we would have only our folly to regret, when the ſources would happen to become dry. Bengal, without ruin to itſelf, could ſpare none of its ſpecie; and the objects to which our aim ſhould have been directed, are as obvious as they are ſalutary. We ought to have encouraged agriculture, the trade with the reſt of Aſia, and internal manufacture.</p>

Manufactures, by theſe means, would not only fall in their price, but they would be produced in a greater quantity; larger inveſtments might be made by the Company, the conſumption would encreaſe, and the profits riſe.

The Company have, in the mean time, been endeavouring, by every poſſible meaſure, to encreaſe their inveſtments, without raiſing the price. Various oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have, for this purpoſe, been adopted. This wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expedient is of ſhort duration. The manufacturer

An eſtabliſhed idea of property is the ſource of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry among individuals, and, of courſe, the foundation of public proſperity. When mankind are reſtrained from poſſeſſing any thing which they can call their own, they are but paſſengers in their native country, and make only thoſe ſlight accommodations which ſuit fugitive wayfarers through the land. A careleſſneſs for induſtry is the natural conſequence of the tranſitorineſs of the fruits of toil; and men ſit ſluggiſhly down, with their hands in their boſoms, when they are not for a moment certain of poſſeſſing property, much leſs of tranſmitting it to their poſterity or friends.</p>

                  <head>Concluding Reflections.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Preſent</note>ARGUMENTS deduced from general principles,  however obvious they may appear, ſtrike not the bulk of mankind ſo forcibly as facts. The revenues of Bengal, without including the Jagieers, amounted, in the year 1766, to near three millions and ſix hundred thouſand pounds of our money. The charges of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, the Nabob's government, penſions, civil, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and marine expences, being deducted, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a balance of one million three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, for the Company. The expences have ſince been encreaſing yearly, and the revenues decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Both were haſtening to that middle point, which would balance the accounts of the Britiſh nation, with the fortune of their arms in the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">ruinous ſtate</note>To conceal this decreaſe as much as poſſible, men fell on a very ſhallow and poor expedient. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants  of the Company protracted the time of cloſing
<pb n="cli" facs="tcp:0828300200:149"/>
the accounts to make up the uſual ſum; and, by theſe means, an encroachment of five months was, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, made upon the ſucceeding year. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this circumſtance, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that the collections are not fixed to a particular term. They are continued without intermiſſion, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the five months, which may amount to one million five hundred thouſand pounds, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from the accounts made up, ſince the Dewanny was ſubmitted to our management.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</note>Notwithſtanding this deception, it was not the only  deficiency in the ſtate of money affairs. The reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the year 1769 had, beſides, fallen ſhort five hundred thouſand pounds; and what further reduction the famine which enſued may have made, time can only demonſtrate. By the beſt accounts from Bengal, there was not a balance of five hundred thouſand pounds remaining, after all expences were paid; and this was not above half the ſum neceſſary to purchaſe the annual inveſtments of the Company. No fair concluſion, however, can be drawn from the produce of one year; and the vigilance of the Court of Directors has ſince eſtabliſhed ſome beneficial regulations. To flatter the ſanguine, we will ſuppoſe, that the net balance will amount, on the preſent ſooting, to one million. The
<pb n="clii" facs="tcp:0828300200:150"/>
ſum is juſt ſufficient for the inveſtments of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; without leaving a ſingle farthing in the treaſury to anſwer any extraordinary emergency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Obvious</note>The advantages of the propoſed plan are obvious;  and, therefore, eaſily explained. Let it be ſuppoſed, that the rent-roll of the year 1766 ſhall be taken as the rule of the quit-rent to be paid, after the ſale of the lands. Let none think this ſum too much. Under the management of the proprietors, the lands would in a few years produce, thrice the ſum of three millions ſix hundred thouſand pounds; but the ſubject muſt receive a bride for his induſtry. The Company, at preſent, complain, that the Talookdârs, or thoſe who poſſeſs lands in property, run away with all the tenants. Their eſtates are flouriſhing, whilſt our limited policy of letting the lands by the year, has created ſolitudes around. After a thorough examination of fictitious tenures, private encroachments and public embezzlements, we may, with great propriety, venture to add, at leaſt one million to the above ſum. But to ſpeak with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which precludes reply, we ſhall only take it for granted, that four hundred thouſand pounds are, by theſe means, only gained. Even this ſum will fix the annual revenue at four millions; and there let it reſt till the proſperity of the country ſhall authoriſe an encreaſe, by ſlight impoſts on trade and the articles of conſumption.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Advantages</note>The abolition of the tyrannical and impolitic govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment  of the Nabob, will be a ſaving of five hundred thouſand pounds on the annual expences. The fact is notorious, that the real expence of this ſecondary and intermediate government, in penſions and in the mode of collection, exceeds ſix hundred thouſand pounds; but the judicial and fiſcal ſyſtems eſtabliſhed in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plan will not exceed one hundred thouſand pounds, with all the advantages of a ſalutary and equitable admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of juſtice and law. To this ſum we may add the five hundred thouſand pounds which have fallen off from the revenue, as the firſt-fruits of the plan; all which, ſuppoſing the expences of the civil, military, and marine departments to remain as at preſent, would make an annual difference of one million four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, in favour of the Company. The inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Company might in that caſe be increaſed, yet leave a ſum for the treaſury in Calcutta for emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</p>

Two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in ſpecie would be ſufficient. To employ the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus to advantage, together with the ten millions, which are ſuppoſed to ariſe from the ſale of the lands, a bank ought to be eſtabliſhed for the purpoſe of lending out ſums of money, not exceeding three years purchaſe on landed ſecurity to the Proprietors, at the intereſt of ſeven per centum. The land-holders would be, by theſe

means, enabled to raiſe the neceſſary ſums, at leſs than half the intereſt which they now pay; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany would have good ſecurity for their advances. Let us ſuppoſe, that, in the courſe of a few years, ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions were lent upon theſe terms, that ſum would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an annual intereſt of ſeven hundred thouſand pounds; which, upon the whole plan, makes a yearly balance, in favour of the Company, of TWO MILLIONS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS MORE THAN THEY AT PRESENT RECEIVE, excluſive of a PRODIGIOUS and GROWING TREASURE; and the moderate impoſts which may be hereafter laid on articles of luxury.</p>

It would produce, even partially followed, immenſe, ſudden, and permanent advantages; but no human foreſight can abſolutely eſtimate the preciſe ſums. Though the Author of the Enquiry has not the vanity to ſuppoſe that his ſcheme is, in all its branches, infallible, he will venture to pledge himſelf to his country, that, ſhould the more material parts of his ſyſtem be adopted, the advantages to be derived from it would not fall ſhort of his calculations. His know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the kingdom of Bengal, and its various re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, gives him a confidence on this ſubject, to which he is not intitled by his abilities.</p>

                  <note place="margin">General</note>THE great abilities of Akbar confirmed the houſe of Timur on the throne, and eſtabliſhed tranquillity over all their vaſt conqueſts in India. Vigorous in his meaſures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out  tyranny, he impreſſed the minds of men with awe, and checked that ſpirit of diſcord and private ambition, which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in more feeble reigns. Government becoming ſettled and uniform in its regulations, the arts of civil life began to increaſe and flouriſh, among a people naturally induſtrious and ingenious. The ſplendor of the court, the wealth of individuals, created a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0828300200:163"/>
general taſte for pomp and magnificence; and the crowded levees of the great, where all endeavoured to excel in the art of pleaſing, rendered the Indians equal in politeneſs to the nations of Europe. Learning was not unknown, if we exclude the abſtruſe ſciences. The Arabian and Brahmin ſyſtems of philoſophy were ſtudied; and the powers of the mind were generally cultivated and improved.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>This character of civilization, it muſt be confeſſed, tallies not  with the political conduct of the people. But neceſſity and ſelf-preſervation make a kind of apology for crimes under deſpotiſm, which would be unpardonable in a community governed by general and known laws. In ſtates ſubject to arbitrary government, there is no ſecurity, no honour, no independence in private life. The nation is divided into two ſorts of people, the oppreſſors and the oppreſſed. Every man of ſpirit, of family, and of fortune, muſt, in ſelf-defence, endeavour to poſſeſs a ſhare of the government under which he was born. When he ſtarts forth from obſcurity, he muſt adopt the political principles of his country, or be ruined in all his ſchemes, however repugnant theſe principles may be to the general dictates of humanity, and the particular diſpoſition of his own mind.

yet the dominions of the family of Timur, in their northern and ſouthern frontiers, fell under the thirty-ſixth and ninetenth parallels of latitude; and they extended themſelves, from eaſt to weſt, about twenty-five degrees. The revenues, according to the Imperial regiſter, were thirty-two millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, received in the exchequer, excluſive of the cuſtomary preſents, and the eſtates of the officers of the crown, which at their death reverted to the emperor, and amounted, at a mediùm, to twenty millions more of our money.

Selim, Akbar's only ſurviving ſon, notwithſtanding the diſputes which he had formerly with his father, was ſtill looked upon as the heir of the empire. But the Viſier's daughter being married to Chuſero, the eldeſt ſon of Selim, that miniſter was deſirous of placing the reins of government in the hands of his ſon-in-law. He was ſupported in this ſcheme by many of the nobles; the moſt enterprizing and powerful of whom was Raja Man Singh, whoſe ſiſter was the mother of Chuſero. The Raja, from the antiquity of his family, and his own addreſs, commanded all the Hindoo intereſt in the empire; and he had, at that very time, twenty thouſand of his native ſubjects of the Rajaput tribe in and near the environs of the capital, prepared to execute his orders. Selim being apprized of the powerful confederacy againſt him, waited upon his father Akbar, two days before his death, and laid before him all their ſchemes. The emperor called them to his preſence, reprimanded them ſeverely; and having publicly acknowledged Selim his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

The promiſe extorted by the emperor from the Viſier and Man Singh in favour of Selim, had no effect on their conduct. He was no ſooner dead than they aſſembled their party in the houſe of the former, and renewed their deliberations in favour of Chuſero, in prejudice of his father. Selim in the mean time was not idle. He convened all his friends in his own palace. Things remained in ſuſpenſe for ſome hours. Ferid Bochari, who commanded the city-guards, took at length a ſpirited reſolution. He ordered the gates to be ſhut, to prevent any troops from entering the city; and, taking the keys in his hand, haſtened to the palace of Selim. He preſented them on his knees, and ſaluted him emperor. All preſent followed his example. The news ſoon reached the houſe of the Viſier. The party of Chuſero was ſtruck with a ſudden panic. They broke up from council, and made all poſſible haſte to pay their reſpects to the new ſovereign. The Viſier took care not to be the laſt. The hopes of Chuſero were daſhed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was ſeized with fear, and fled down the river in a ſmall canoe, with Raja Man Singh, and concealed himſelf in that prince's houſe till he obtained a pardon from his father.

The moſt remarkable event of Selim's life, before his acceſſion, was, his diſobedience to his father's orders, rather than his rebellion againſt him, about two years prior to that monarch's death. Inſolent at firſt, he refuſed to return to his duty, and was once actually at the head of ſeventy thouſand men. Upon the death of the prince Daniâl, he, however, ſubmitted, having then a nearer proſpect of the throne; Akbar having upbraided him for his diſobedience at firſt, and his puſillanimity afterwards, for throwing himſelf upon an enraged ſovereign's mercy, when he was at the head of a great army, received him into favour. When Selim took the reins of government in his hands, he aſſumed the titles of Noor-ul-dien Mahommed JEHANGIRE, or Mahommed the Light of the Faith and CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD. He dated the commencement of his reign from the twentieth of the ſecond Jemmâd 1014, which anſwers to the 21ſt of October 1605, being then in the thirty-ſeventh year of his age.

Man Singh was diſpatched to his ſubaſhip of Bengal; Chan Azim to that of Malava.

Agra; and entered the town, when the troops, who garriſoned the place, were on the parade. They halted for refreſhment; and they had the good fortune not to be ſuſpected by the officer who commanded at Muttra. Huſſein Beg Chan Buduchſhi, who had been governor of the province of Cabul during a conſiderable part of the former reign, being turned out of his office by the emperor, was on his way to court. Having travelled in the night on account of the heat of the weather, he happened to enter the city of Muttra at the oppoſite gate juſt when the prince arrived. They met in the market-place. Chuſero was no ſtranger to the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Huſſein; and eſteeming him a great acquiſition to his party, from his known bravery and popularity among the Tartars, who formed a great part of the imperial army, he called him aſide, and having ſounded him, laid open his whole plan. Huſſein being conſcious of no crime againſt the ſtate, thought himſelf highly injured by Jehangire.

Small parties of horſe were at the ſame time diſperſed through the country on every ſide; and ſuch as did not immediately take up arms in favour of Chuſero were ſubmitted to military execution, and all the ſeverities of war.

Some more reſolute defended themſelves againſt the rebels, and to their valour owed their lives. The orders of the prince, it muſt be owned, did not extend to ſuch rigour and cruelty.

He ordered him to be brought before him, with a golden chain from his left hand to his left foot, according to the laws of his anceſtors, Zingis and Timur. Huſſein, loaded with iron chains, was placed on the right hand of Chuſero; Abdul Rahim, another of the principal rebels, on his left. Jehangire ſternly aſked his ſon, <q rend="inline">"What could induce thee, Sultan Chuſero, to rebel againſt thy ſovereign and father?"</q> Chuſero was ſilent: the emperor began to relent.

Any information from the prince would be unneceſſary. The conſpirators had impeached one another; and three hundred of the chiefs were already ſeized. The prince was delivered over, in cloſe confinement, into the hands of the paymaſter-general. Huſſein was ſentenced to be ſewed up in the raw hide of an ox, and to be thrown in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into the ſtreet.

He lived for ſeveral days in that miſerable condition. Three hundred pales in the mean time were ſet up in two rows along the public road. The rebels, to that number, were drawn alive on the pales. Chuſero was brought every day, as long as any of the unhappy wretches breathed, under their tortures, to view the horrid ſight.

                  <note place="margin">Story of Chaja Aiaſs.</note>About twenty years before this period, Chaja Aiaſs, a native  of the weſtern Tartary, left that country to puſh his fortune in Hindoſtan. He was deſcended of an ancient and noble family, fallen into decay by various revolutions of fortune. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had received a good education, which was all his parents could beſtow. Falling in love with a young woman, as poor as himſelf, he married her; but he found it difficult to provide for her the very neceſſaries of life. Reduced to the laſt extremity, he turned his thoughts upon India, the uſual reſource of the needy Tartars of the north. He left privately friends, who either would not or could not aſſiſt him, and turned his face to a foreign country. His all conſiſted of one ſorry horſe, and a very ſmall ſum of money, which had proceeded from the ſale of his other effects. Placing his wife upon the horſe, he walked by her ſide. She hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be with child, and could ill endure the fatigue of ſo great a journey. Their ſcanty pittance of money was ſoon expended: they had even ſubſiſted, for ſome days, upon charity, when they arrived on the ſkirts of the Great Solitudes, which ſeparate Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary from the dominions of the family of Timur, in India. No houſe was there to cover them from the inclemency of the weather; no hand to relieve their wants. To return, was certain miſery; to proceed, apparent deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His diſtreſs</note>They had faſted three days: to complete their misfortunes, the  wife of Aiaſs was taken in labour. She began to reproach her huſband for leaving his native country at an unfortunate hour; for exchanging a quiet, though poor life, for the ideal proſpect of wealth in a diſtant country. In this diſtreſſed ſituation ſhe brought forth a daughter. They remained in the place for ſome hours, with a vain hope that travellers might paſs that way. They were diſappointed. Human feet ſeldom tread theſe deſarts: the ſun declined a-pace. They feared the approach of night: the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0828300200:182"/>
place was the haunt of wild beaſts; and ſhould they eſcape their hunger, they muſt fall by their own. Chaja Aiaſs, in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, having placed his wife on the horſe, found himſelf ſo much exhauſted that he could ſcarcely move. To carry the child was impoſſible: the mother could not even hold herſelf faſt on the horſe. A long conteſt began between Humanity and Neceſſity: the latter prevailed, and they agreed to expoſe the child on the high-way. The infant, covered with leaves, was placed under a tree; and the diſconſolate parents proceeded in tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">in the deſart.</note>When they had advanced about a mile from the place, and the  eyes of the mother could no longer diſtinguiſh the ſolitary tree under which ſhe had left her daughter, ſhe gave way to grief; and throwing herſelf from the horſe on the ground, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <q rend="inline">"My child! my child!"</q> She endeavoured to raiſe herſelf; but ſhe had no ſtrength to return. Aiaſs was pierced to the heart. He prevailed upon his wife to ſit down. He promiſed to bring her the infant. He arrived at the place. No ſooner had his eyes reached the child, than he was almoſt ſtruck dead with horror. A black ſnake, ſay our authors, was coiled around it; and Aiaſs believed he beheld him extending his fatal jaws to devour the infant. The father ruſhed forward. The ſerpent, alarmed at his vociferation, retired into the hollow tree. He took up his daughter unhurt, and returned to the mother. He gave her child into her arms; and, as he was informing her of the wonderful eſcape of the infant, ſome travellers appeared, and ſoon relieved them of all their wants. They proceeded gradually and came to Lahore.</p>

and he received him with attention and friendſhip. To employ him, he made him his own ſecretary. Aiaſs ſoon recommended himſelf to Aſiph in that ſtation; and, by ſome accident, his diligence and ability attracted the notice of the emperor, who raiſed him to the command of a thouſand horſe. He become, in proceſs of time, maſter of the houſehold; and his genius being ſtill greater than even his good fortune, he raiſed himſelf to the office and title of Actimâd-ul-Dowla, or high treaſurer of the empire.

He was naturally high-ſpirited and proud; and it was not to be expected, that he would yield to indignity and public ſhame.—His family, his former reputation was high.—Born of noble parents in Turkomania, he had ſpent his youth in Perſia; and had ſerved, with uncommon renown, Shaw Iſmaël the third of the Sufvi line. His original name was Aſta Jillô, but having killed a lion, he was dignified with the title of Shere Afkun, or the Overthrower of the Lion. Under the latter name he became famous in India. In the wars of Akbar, he had ſerved with great reputation. He had diſtinguiſhed himſelf, in a particular manner, under Chan Chanan, at the taking of Sind, by exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prodigies of perſonal ſtrength and valour.

He received him graciouſly, and conferred new honours upon him. Shere Afkun, naturally open and generous, ſuſpected not the emperor's intentions. Time, he thought, had crazed the memory of Mher-ul-Niſſa from Jehangire's mind. He was deceived. The monarch was reſolved to remove his rival; but the means he uſed were, at once, fooliſh and diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He appointed a day for hunting; and ordered the haunt of an enormous tiger to be explored. News was ſoon brought, that a tiger of an extraordinary ſize was diſcovered in the foreſt of Nidarbari. This ſavage, it was ſaid, had carried off many of the largeſt oxen from the neighbouring villages. The emperor directed thither his march, attended by Shere Afkun, and ſeveral thouſands of his principal officers, with all their trains.

He ſeemed not to underſtand their meaning: at length three Omrahs ſtarted forth from the circle, and ſacriſicing fear to ſhame, fell at the emperor's feet, and begged permiſſion to try ſingly their ſtrength againſt the formidable animal. The pride of Shere Afkun aroſe. He had imagined, that none durſt attempt a deed ſo dangerous. He hoped, that after the refuſal of the nobles, the honour of the enterprize would devolve in courſe on his hands. But three had offered themſelves for the combat: and they were bound in honour to inſiſt on their prior right. Afraid of loſing his former renown, Shere Afkun began thus in the preſence: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"To attack an animal with weapons is both unmanly and unfair. God has given to man limbs and ſinews as well as to tigers: he has added reaſon to the former to conduct his ſtrength."</q>The other Omrahs objected in vain,  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That all men were inferior to the tiger in ſtrength; and that he could be overcome only with ſteel."</q>

A ſnare, however, was prepared for him. Jehangire had meanly condeſcended to give private orders to the rider of one of his largeſt elephants to waylay his rival, in one of the narrow ſtreets, when he next ſhould return to court, and there to tread him to death. As accidents of that kind ſometimes happen, from the rage of thoſe animals in the rutting ſeaſon, the thing might have paſſed without ſuſpicion. Shere was carried in his palanky. He ſaw the elephant in his way. He gave orders to the bearers to return back: the elephant came forward. They threw the palanky, with their maſter, in the ſtreet, and ſled to ſave their lives. Shere ſaw his danger. He had juſt time to riſe. He drew a ſhort ſword, which always hung by his ſide: with this weapon he ſtruck the elephant acroſs the root of the trunk, which he cut off with one blow. The animal roared, turned from him, fell down and expired. The emperor was looking out at a window. Here tired with amazement and ſhame. Shere continued his way to the palace. Without any ſuſpicion of treachery, he related the particulars to Jehangire. The latter diſguiſed his ſentiments, but reliquiſhed not his deſigns. He
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0828300200:188"/>
praiſed the ſtrength and valour of Shere, who retired ſatisfied and unſuſpecting from the preſence.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſcomfits</note>Whether the emperor endeavoured to conquer his paſſion for  Mher-ul-Niſſa, or felt remorſe from his own behaviour, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but, for the ſpace of ſix months, no further attempts were made againſt the life of Shere, who now retired to the capital of Bengal. The former deſigns of Jehangire were no ſecret. They were the ſubject of common converſation, little to the advantage of the character of a great prince. Abſolute monarchs, however, are never without men who flatter their worſt paſſions, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to their moſt pernicious pleaſures. Kuttub, Suba of Bengal, was one of theſe convenient ſycophants. To ingratiate himſelf with the emperor, though perhaps not by his expreſs commands, he hired forty ruſſians, to attack and murder Shere, when an opportunity ſhould offer. Shere was apprized of the intentions of Kuttub. He continued within doors: but ſuch was his confidence in his own ſtrength and valour, that at night he would not permit his ſervants to remain in his houſe. They, according to cuſtom, retired each to his own home. An old porter only remained of the men ſervants, under the ſame roof with Shere. The aſſaſſins were no ſtrangers to a circumſtance common in India. They made their obſervations upon the houſe. They found that there was a room, on the right hand, within the the principal door, which Shere uſed, as a writing-chamber. This room communicated, by a narrow paſſage, with the ſleeping apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When it was dark, they took advantage of the old porter's abſence, and conveyed themſelves, without diſcovery, into the houſe.</p>

he was fallen aſleep, ſtole ſilently into his apartment. They prepared to plunge their daggers into his body, when one of them, who was an old man, being touched with remorſe, cried out with a loud voice: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Hold! have we not the emperor's orders? Let us behave like men. Shall forty fall upon one, and that one aſleep!"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Boldly ſpoken,"</q> ſaid Shere; ſtarting that inſtant from his bed. Seizing his ſword, he placed himſelf in a corner of the room. There he was attacked by the aſſaſſins. In a few minutes, many of the villains lay, weltering in their blood, at his feet. Scarce one half eſcaped without a wound. The old man, who had given warning, did not attempt to fly. Shere took him by the hand, praiſed and thanked him for his behaviour, and, having enquired about thoſe who had hired the aſſaſſins, diſmiſſed him, with handſome preſents, to relate the particulars abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">He is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note>The fame of this gallant exploit reſounded through the whole  empire. Shere could not ſtir abroad for the mob, who preſſed around him. He, however, thought proper to retire from the capital of Bengal, to his old reſidence at Burdwan. He hoped to live there in obſcurity and ſafety, with his beloved Mher-ul-Niſſa. He was deceived. The Suba of Bengal had received his government, for the purpoſe of removing the unfortunate Shere; and he was not ungrateful. After deliberating with himſelf about the means, he, at laſt, fell upon an effectual expedient. Settling the aſſairs of his government at Tanda, which was, at that time, the capital of Bengal, he reſolved, with a great retinue, to make the tour of the dependent provinces. In his rout he came to Burdwan. He made no ſecret to his principal oſſicers, that he had the emperor's orders for diſpatching Shere. That devoted Omrah, hearing that the Suba was entering the town in which he reſided, mounted his horſe, and, with two ſervants only, went to pay his reſpects. The Suba received Shere with aſſected
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0828300200:190"/>
politeneſs. They rode, for ſome time, ſide by ſide; and their converſation turned upon indifferent aſſairs. The Suba ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtopt. He ordered his elephant of ſtate to be brought; which he mounted, under a pretence of appearing with becoming pomp in the city of Burdwan. Shere ſtood ſtill, when the Suba was aſcending; and one of the pikemen, pretending that Shere was in the way, ſtruck his horſe, and began to drive him before him. Shere was enraged at the affront. He knew that the pikeman durſt not have uſed that freedom without his maſter's orders: he ſaw plainly, that there was a laid deſign againſt his life. He turned round upon the pikeman; and threatened him with inſtant death. He fell on the ground and begged for mercy. Swords were drawn. Shere had no time to loſe. He ſpurred his horſe up to the elephant, on which the Suba was mounted; and having broke down the amari or caſtle, cut him in two; and thus the unfortunate Kuttub became the victim of his own zeal to pleaſe the emperor. Shere did not reſt here: he turned his ſword on the other officers. The firſt that fell by his hands, was Aba Chan, a native of Caſhmire; who was an Omrah of five thouſand horſe. Four other nobles ſhared the ſame fate. A death attended every blow from the hand of Shere. The remaining chiefs were at once aſtoniſhed and frightened. They ſled to a diſtance, and formed a circle around him. Some began to gall him with arrows; others to ſire with their muſquets. His horſe, at length, being ſhot with a ball in the forehead, fell under him. The unfortunate Shere, reduced to the laſt extremity, began to upbraid them with cowardice. He invited them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to ſingle combat; but he begged in vain. He had already received ſome wounds. He plainly ſaw his approaching fate. Turning his ſace toward Mecca, he took up ſome duſt with his hand; and, for want of water, threw it, by way of ablution, upon his head. He then ſtood up, ſeemingly unconcerned. Six balls
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0828300200:191"/>
entered his body, in different places, before he fell. His enemies had ſcarce the courage to come near, till they ſaw him in the laſt agonies of death. They praiſed his valour to the ſkies: but in adding to his reputation, they took away from their own.</p>

He was afraid that Mher-ul-Niſſa, in the firſt paroxiſms of grief, might make away with herſelf. That lady, however, bore her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes with more fortitude and reſignation. She was unwilling to adopt the manners of her country, upon ſuch tragical occaſions. She even pretended, in vindication of her apparent inſenſibility, to ſollow the injunctions of her deceaſed lord. She alleged that Shere, foreſeeing his own fall by Jehangire, had conjured her to yield to the deſires of that monarch without heſitation. The reaſons, which ſhe ſaid, he gave, were as fecble as the fact itſelf was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.

Her vanity was diſappointed. Though ſhe was received with great tenderneſs and affection, by Rokia Sultana Begum, the emperor's mother, Jehangire refuſed to ſee her. Whether his mind was then ſixed on another object, or remorſe had taken poſſeſſion of his ſoul, authors do not agree. They, however, aſſert, with great improbability, that the emperor was ſo much aſſected with the death of his ſavourite, the Suba of Bengal, that he reſolved to puniſh Mher-ul-Niſſa, for an accident in which ſhe had no concern. Be that as it will, he gave orders to ſhut her up in one of the worſt apartments of the ſeraglio. He even
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0828300200:192"/>
would not deign to ſee her; and, contrary to his uſual munificence to women, he allowed her but fourteen anas, about two ſhillings of our money, a-day, for the ſubſiſtance of herſelf and ſome female ſlaves. This coldneſs to a woman whom he paſſionately loved when not in his power, was at once unaccountable and abſurd.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Not ſeen by the emperor,</note>Mher-ul-Niſſa was a woman of a haughty ſpirit, and could not brook this treatment. She had no remedy. She gave herſelf up,  for ſome time, to grief, as if for the death of her huſband; but it was diſappointment only that preyed upon her mind. She was at length reconciled to her condition, from a hope of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of re-kindling the emperor's former love. She truſted to the amazing power of her own beauty; which, to conquer, required only to be ſeen. The emperor's mother, who was deeply intereſted for Mher-ul-Niſſa, could not prevail upon her ſon to ſee her. He turned away from her in ſilence, when ſhe ſpoke of the widow of Shere. An expedient, however, offered itſelf to Mher-ul-Niſſa. To raiſe her own reputation in the ſeraglio, and to ſupport herſelf and ſlaves with more decency, than the ſcanty pittance allowed her would admit, ſhe called forth her invention and taſte in working ſome admirable pieces of tapeſtry and embroidery, in painting ſilks with exquiſite delicacy, and in inventing female ornaments of every kind. Theſe articles were carried, by her ſlaves, to the diſſerent ſquares of the royal ſeraglio, and to the harams of the great officers of the empire. The inventions of Mher-ul-Niſſa excelled ſo much in their kind, that they were bought with the greateſt avidity. Nothing was faſhionable among the ladies of Delhi and Agra, but the work of her hands. She accumulated, by theſe means, a conſiderable ſum of money, with which ſhe repaired and beautified her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

                  <note place="margin">till the end of four years.</note>In this ſituation the widow of Shere continued four years,  without once having ſeen the emperor. Her fame reached his ears from every apartment in the ſeraglio. Curioſity at length vanquiſhed his reſolution. He determined to be an eye-witneſs of the things which he had ſo often heard, concerning Mher-ul-Niſſa. He reſolved to ſurprize her: and communicating his reſolution to none, he ſuddenly entered her apartments, where he found every thing ſo elegant and magnificent, that he was ſtruck with amazement. But the greateſt ornament of the whole was Mher-ul-Niſſa herſelf. She lay half reclined, on an embroidered ſopha, in a plain muſlin dreſs. Her ſlaves ſat in a circle round her, at work, attired in rich brocades. She ſlowly aroſe, in manifeſt confuſion; and received the emperor with the uſual ceremony of touching firſt the ground, then her forehead with her right hand. She did not utter one word; but ſtood with her eyes fixed on the ground. Jehangire remained for ſome time ſilent. He admired her ſhape, her ſtature, her beauty, her grace; and that inexpreſſible voluptuouſneſs of mein, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reſiſt.</p>

He at length ſat down on the ſopha, and requeſted Mher-ul-Niſſa to ſit by his ſide. The firſt queſtion he aſked, was, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Why this difference between the appearance of Mher-ul-Niſſa and her ſlaves?"</q>She very ſhrewdly replied,  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Thoſe born to ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude muſt dreſs as it ſhall pleaſe thoſe whom they ſerve.

He took her at once in his arms. His former affection returned, with all its violence; and the very next day, public orders were iſſued to prepare a magnificent feſtival, for the celebration of his nuptials with Mher-ul-Niſſa. Her name was alſo changed by an edict into Noor-Mâhil, or the Light of the Seraglio. The emperor's former favourites vaniſhed before her; and during the reſt of the reign of Jehangire, ſhe bore the chief ſway in all the affairs of the empire.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Promotion of her family.</note>The great power of Noor-Mâhil appeared, for the firſt time,  in the immediate advancement of her family. Her father, who, in the latter end of the reign of Akbar, had been chief treaſurer of the empire, was raiſed to the office of abſolute viſier and firſt miniſter. Ferid Bochari, who, under the title of Mortaza Chan, managed the affairs of the empire, had been, by a ſtroke of the palſy, rendered unfit for buſineſs, which opened the way for the promotion of the Actemâd-ul-Dowlat. The two brothers of Noor-Mâhil were raiſed to the firſt rank of nobility, by the titles of Acticâd Chan and Aſiph Jah. Her numerous relations poured in from Tartary, upon hearing of the fortune of the houſe of Aiaſs. Some of them were gratified with high employments, all with lucrative ones. Her father was not dazzled with the ſplendor of his high ſtation. He was a man of probity in private life, of ability in office. He became a great and good miniſter. His name is revered to this day in Hindoſtan. The talents of her brothers were rather popular than great. They behaved with honour and moderation upon every occaſion; ſtrangers to inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and enemies to oppreſſion. The invidiouſneſs of their ſituation did not raiſe envy. Men allowed, that merit intitled

Eaſy in his temper, and naturally  voluptuous, the powers of his ſoul were locked up in a pleaſing enthuſiaſm of love, by the engaging converſation and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary beauty of Noor-Mâhil. The ſtate, however, did not ſuffer from the negligent indolence of the emperor. An ample field was left for the virtues and abilities of the new viſier; who turned his attention more to domeſtic improvement than to foreign conqueſt. Agriculture, which had been much neglected, was encouraged. Many provinces, deſolated by former diſturbances and wars, were, by degrees, repeopled and cultivated. Security of property was given to the farmer; the induſtry of the mechanic was protected. The country aſſumed a new face: the uſeful arts were revived and flouriſhed in the cities. The viſier even extended his improvements to deſarts. Foreſts, formerly the haunts of wild beaſts, were cut down; and villages and towns

The revenues of the empire gradually increaſed: to prevent extortion in the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every Suba was obliged to tranſmit monthly to court, a ſtate of the improvements and regulations made, in conſequence of public inſtructions from Agra. When the improvements were not adequate to the taxes, the Subas were either ſeverely repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or degraded. No diſtinctions were made, in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice, between the Mahommedan and Hindoo. Both were worſhippers of God, each in his way; both members of the ſame community, and ſubjects of the ſame lord.</p>

They entered Cabul, with a conſiderable army, and began to exerciſe all the cruelties of war. The inhabitants, rendered deſperate by misfortune, took arms againſt the plunderers. The city became a ſeene of ſlaughter and diſtreſs. Nadili Meidani, a gallant man, and an officer of rank in the province, haſtened to the relief of Cabul.

Aſman, an Afgan, deſcended of the race of the Patan princes, who reigned in India before the empire fell under the dominion of the houſe of Timur, ſtirred up a rebellion. He had formerly made many attempts to recover the throne of his fathers; but this was his moſt formidable and reſolute effort. Sujait, an officer of rank, was diſpatched againſt the rebel by Iſlam Chan, Suba of Bengal. Both armies ſoon came to an action. Sujait was on the point of being defeated. He drove his elephant, as the laſt reſort of deſpair, through the thickeſt of the enemy, in ſearch of Aſman, who was mounted on a horſe. The elephant having ſeized the horſe, daſhed him and his rider againſt the ground; but when the animal was about to tread the unfortunate Aſman under his feet, one of his attendants came and wounded the elephant in the trunk. The elephant, with the pain of the wound, plunged in ſuch a manner, that Sujait was thrown off, and fell headlong on the ground. His life was ſaved by his men; who ſeeing him expoſing his perſon, became leſs careful about their own. In their effort to extricate their chief, they repulſed the enemy. Aſman, bruiſed with his fall, was carried back to his tent, where he ſoon after expired. His death gave the victory to Sujait, and quaſhed the rebellion in Bengal. Sujait, for this ſignal ſervice, was raiſed by the emperor to the title of Ruſtum Zimân, which ſignified the Hercules of the Age.</p>

Cuttub, deſcended of the Rohilla tribe of Afgans, and a native of Atcha, found his way to Behâr. That province was poſſeſſed by a number of his nation, who had ſettled there under the Patan em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He affirmed that he was the prince Chuſero, the reigning emperor's ſon; and he accompanied his impoſture with a probable ſtory of his eſcape from priſon. The misfortunes of Chuſero had rendered him popular. Many believed the tale. Many, in love with innovation and ſpoil, joined the ſtandard of Cuttub. He numbered, in leſs than a week, ſeven thouſand among his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. He aſſumed immediately the Imperial titles, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, with his motley army of banditti, toward Patna, the capital of the province of Behâr. Aſſil Chan, the Suba of the province, was abſent at Gazipoor, about one hundred and twenty miles from Patna; and his deputy commanded in the city, when Cuttub appeared before it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Quaſhed.</note>The city of Patna was too large and ill-garriſoned with troops  to make any defence. Cuttub entered it, with little oppoſition. He took poſſeſſion of the palace, women, and wealth of the Suba; and, giving up Patna to plunder, divided the ſpoil among his adherents. Some, who were no ſtrangers to the perſon of Sultan Chuſero, endeavoured to expoſe the impoſture. They ſuffered for their raſhneſs, and were put to death. Some, conſcious of the impoſition, were afraid to own their folly; and, having gone ſo far, were unwilling and aſhamed to recede. Aſſil himſelf, at firſt, gave ſome credit to a report brought from all quarters. He knew not how to behave. He affected the party of Chuſero; and he feared the emperor. Ten days after Patna was ſurprized by Cuttub, Aſſil was convinced, by various letters, that the leader of the inſurrection was not the prince. He haſtened from Gazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poor, with all the forces he could collect. On the third day he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0828300200:200"/>
preſented himſelf before Patna. Cuttub marched out and gave him battle. The inſurgents were defeated and fled. In the hurry of their flight they neglected to ſhut the gates; and the enemy entered at their heels. The pretended prince, driven to the laſt extremity, ſhut himſelf up, with a few friends, in the Suba's houſe. He defended himſelf for ſome time. Aſſil, having loſt twenty men in endeavouring to ſcale the walls, was ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to kill the impoſtor with a brick-bat; and thus a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous kind of death put an end to the ambitious views of Cuttub.</p>

Freſh diſturbances broke out in a different corner of the empire. Amar Sinka, prince of Odipour, in the Decan, ſetting ſuddenly upon the Imperial troops on the frontier, defeated them. The action hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened near the city of Brampour, among the mountains of Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. The emperor was alarmed. He placed his ſecond ſon, Purvez, at the head of thirty thouſand horſe; and gave him, at the ſame time, a commiſſion to take the command of all the troops on the confines of the Imperial dominions and the Decan. The force, had it even been well conducted, was no more than adequate to the ſervice. Amar Sinka, who went under the title of Rana, or THE PRINCE, by way of eminence, deduced his deſcent from the Imperial family, who reigned in the great city of Kinôge over all India for many centuries, before that empire was invaded by the followers of Mahommed. He added power to his noble birth.

The ſpirit of diſcord ſpread from the council of war to the army. Each of the great Omrahs had his partizans and abettors. Faction and tumult reigned in every corner of the camp. The prince was naturally mild; he wanted experience; and he was deſtitute of that intrepid firmneſs and ſeverity, which is neceſſary to awe mankind into obedience. He deſcended to intreaty where he ought to command; and when he endeavoured to reconcile them, their paſſion became more inflamed, as every check was removed by his known ſoftneſs of diſpoſition.</p>

Proviſions and forage became ſcarce: the fields around were red with the freſh graves of the dead. But though the council of war diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed about an attack, they concurred in a retreat. They fled with precipitation to Ajmere. The enemy hung on their rear. The Omrahs wrote ſeparately letters to court, with accuſations againſt each other's conduct. Chan Chanan was recalled to Agra, diveſted of all his employments; and he even thought himſelf happy in being able to ſave his life. The diſgrace of this noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man redounded not to the honour of Chan Jehan.

On the ſecond of Shabân, of the one thouſand and twenty-ſecond year of the Higera, he moved the Leſcar or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial camp, with a profeſſed deſign of putting himſelf at the head of the troops employed againſt the Rana. The magnificence of the emperor's progreſs to Ajmere, deſerves a brief deſcription. When the monarchs of Hindoſtan take the field, their camps are a kind of moving cities. That of Jehangire, in his preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, was in circumference at leaſt twenty miles. The Leſcar is divided, like a regular town, into ſquares, alleys, and ſtreets. The royal pavilion is always erected in the center: no man raiſes his nearer than the diſtance of a muſket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot around. Every man of quality, every artificer, knows his ground, the ſpace allotted for him, on which ſide, how far from the emperor he muſt pitch his tent. The pavilions of the great officers of the court are, at a diſtance, known by their ſplendor; at hand, by marks which diſtinguiſh the various ranks of the owners. The ſhops and apartments of tradeſmen are alſo known by rule; and no man is for a moment at a loſs how to ſupply his wants. The Leſcar, from a riſing ground, furniſhes one of the moſt agreeable proſpects in the world. Starting up, in a few hours, in an uninhabited plain, it raiſes the idea of a city built by enchantment: and fills the mind with delightful wonder and ſurprize. Even thoſe who leave their houſes in cities, to follow the prince in his progreſs, are frequently ſo charmed with the Leſcar, when ſituated in a beautiful and convenient place, that they cannot prevail with themſelves to remove. To prevent this inconvenience to the court, the emperor, after ſufficient time is allowed to the tradeſmen to follow, orders them to be burnt out of their tents.</p>

Having ſuperſeded Mohâbet, he entered the mountains without heſitation. The enemy was ſeized with a panic, and fled before him. He made himſelf maſter of Brampour, the capital of the Rana's dominions, with little oppoſition. Several ſkirmiſhes were fought; but no deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive battle.

Churrum knew that the blame of the war did not reſt on the Hindoos. He therefore replied, That excuſes on the ſide of the Rana were unneceſſary; that it was the duty of every prince to exert the power placed in his hands, in defence of his ſubjects and dominions; but as war had been kindled, and the fortune of the Mahommedans had prevailed, he thought it his duty to uſe his ſucceſs with moderation; and that he was willing to put an immediate end to all differences, by a ſolid and laſting peace. The Rana conſented to pay a tribute to the family of Timur. Some diſſiculties aroſe about the ſum: the deciſion was left to Jehangire.

Jehangire treated him, in his converſation, with the higheſt diſtinction; and he ſeemed anxious to expreſs to the world his affection and regard. A court was appointed for him. Eſtates were ſettled upon him, for the maintenance of a body-guard of a thouſand horſe, and fifteen thouſand foot, ſubject only to his commands. Sultan Purvez, in the mean time, declined in his father's eſteem in proportion as Churrum roſe.

Chan Chanan, in ſome meaſure reſtored to favour, remained with Purvez, and managed, under him, the affairs of the province. In the end of the autumn of the 1024 of the Higera, Sir Thomas Roe, the Engliſh Ambaſſador to the court of Agra, arrived at Brampour. Politeneſs and affability were natural to Purvez. Full of honour and good-nature, his virtues were of the milder caſt: too indolent for the fatigues of buſineſs, diffident of his own abilities. He poſſeſſed the perſonal courage of a good ſoldier; but he was deſtitute of the conduct neceſſary to a great general. He followed implicitly the advice of others, when there was no diſagreement in their opinions; when there was, he was embarraſſed, and could not decide.

The preſents given by the ambaſſador were agreeable to the emperor; but a fine coach ſent by King James pleaſed him moſt of all.

After an obſtinate conflict of ſome hours, the Coolies were obliged to fly. Eder took the way of the deſart; and left his caſtle and treaſure to the victor. Laël, in the mean time, was on an excurſion of depredation in another corner of Guzerat. He had robbed a great caravan of all its merchandize; and it was the news of this misfortune that directed Abdalla to the enemy.

Shaw Jehân was deſtined for the command of the army; and Chan Chanan, to deprive him of the honour of a victory over an enemy, who had apparently reſiſted all his own and his pupil's efforts, perſuaded the confederates to ſue for peace, in the Imperial preſence; without alleging their fear of Shaw Jehân as anyways conducive to their offers of pacification. The emperor, however, would not receive their ſubmiſſion, but through the hands of the prince; anxious to raiſe the conſequence of his favourite ſon in the eyes of his ſubjects.</p>

After a tedious journey, he arrived at Mando, in the province of Malava; and took up his reſidence in that city. He did one very popular action on his march.

His affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the beauty of his perſon, recommended him to the vulgar; and they loved him on account of his misfortunes. Many cauſes concurred to make the emperor adopt this meaſure. He was informed, that ſome friends of Shaw Jehân were plotting againſt the life of Chuſero. The miniſter, Aſaph Jah, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Sultana's brother, had alſo behaved rudely to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate prince, and betrayed ſymptoms of diſlike and revenge. Shaw Jehân was probably at the bottom of all. His friends, without his permiſſion, would ſearce have attempted the life of his brother; and he had been lately married to the daughter of Aſaph Jah. The emperor was enraged at their wickedneſs and preſumption; and, by an act of power, fruſtrated, for the time, their deſigns.</p>

An incident at Surat was magnified into an inſult upon the Imperial power, by the prince and his party.

An ambaſſador from Perſia was not ſo ſucceſsful: he was received with little ceremony, and diſmiſſed with a coolneſs little ſhort of contempt. He came to negociate a loan at the court of Agra; and Jehangire was in no humour to give any of his money away. The emperor even deſcended into meanneſs, on the occaſion. The Perſian had been ſerved in all neceſſaries from court. A bill was ordered to be ſent him, when he announced his deſign of departing.

Bred up in the ſchool of Adverſity, Actemâd-ul-Dowla had learned to ſubdue his paſſions, to liſten to the dictates of Reaſon, to feel for the misfortunes of mankind. Having raiſed himſelf from ſervitude to authority, from indigence to honour and wealth, he knew the duties of every ſtation. He was not leſs converſant with the world in practice, than he was from his extenſive reading and the well-weighed reflections of his own mind. An oeconomiſt in every thing, but in charity, he was only covetous of wealth to relieve the needy and the poor. He choſe rather to maintain the dignity of his rank by the number of his friends, than by that of domeſtics, followers, and ſlaves. The people loved him as a father, but feared him as a father too; for he tempered ſeverity with moderation, and lenity with the rigour of the laws. The empire flouriſhed under his wiſe adminiſtration. No evil but luxury prevailed. That weed takes root in proſperity; and, perhaps, can never be eradicated from ſo rich a ſoil.—The empreſs was inconſolable for the death of her father. She propoſed, at once, as a proof of her affection and magnificence, to perpetuate his memory in a monument of ſolid ſilver. The Imperial architect ſoon convinced her, that a metal ſo precious would not be the moſt laſting means of tranſmitting the viſier's fame to poſterity. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"All ages," ſaid he, "are full of a varice; and even the empire of the houſe of Timur, like all ſublunary things, is ſubject to revolution and change."</q> She dropt her purpoſe; and a magnificent fabric of ſtone ſtill retains, in Agra, the name of Actemâd-ul-Dowla.</p>

She diſpoſed of the higheſt offices at pleaſure; and the greateſt honours were conferred at her nod. Aſiph was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his ſiſter's humours.

                  <note place="margin">Expedition into the mountains of Sewalic.</note>Toward the cloſe of the year, the Raja Bickermajît was ſent, with a conſiderable force, to the mountains of Sewalic, to the north-eaſt of the Ganges. In the numerous vallies which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect  that immenſe ridge of hills, many tribes lived, under their native princes, who had never been ſubdued by the arms of the followers of Mahommed. Safe in their inacceſſible retreats, they often iſſued out, in a depredatory manner, from their faſtneſſes, and haraſſed, with incurſions, the northern provinces. Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>majît, after having encountered with great difficulties, penetrated into the heart of their country, and ſat down before the fort of Eangurra, which was ſituated upon a rocky mountain, and thought impregnable. It fell ſoon into his hands; but the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the tribes was not finiſhed till the cloſe of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year. Twenty-two petty princes agreed to pay a certain tribute; and they ſent hoſtages to Agra, as ſecurities for their future obedience.</p>

Jehangire, who, from his affection to his ſon, was highly pleaſed with this increaſe in his family, called the infant AURUNGZEBE, or the Ornament of the Throne.—To avoid the approaching heat of the ſeaſon, the emperor reſolved to remove his court to the delightful country of Caſhmire. Shaw Jehân accompanied his father in his progreſs. They entered the mountains of Sewalic, in their way, and viſited the fort of Ean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurra, which had ſome time before ſurrendered to Bickermajît. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hangire, in a pretended zeal for religion, ordered all the images of the gods of the Hindoos, which were found in a temple within the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, to be broken to pieces; and he aſſiſted in conſecrating the place for the worſhip of God, after the manner preſcribed in the Coran.</p>

Jehangire, after reflecting upon the contemptuous treatment which he had  given to the Perſian ambaſſador, had reſolved to remove any coldneſs which might ariſe on that account, between the two empires. He, for that purpoſe, had diſpatched Chan Alum, with magnificent preſents to Shaw Abas of Perſia. This nobleman was received with every mark of reſpect. The treaties between the two crowns were renewed and confirmed; and the Perſian loaded him with rich preſents, accompanying them with a letter of friendſhip to Jehangire; without mentioning the injurious reception of his own miniſter at the Indian court.</p>

Conſiderable ſums were iſſued from the treaſury, for mending the great roads of the empire. Wells were dug at the end of every two miles; and a building for the reception of way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farers, was erected near each well. This improvement began on the road to Caſhmire, where Jehangire arrived in the beginning of the year 1029. He was highly pleaſed with that moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful province. The principal valley of which it conſiſts, being much more elevated than the plains of India, is cool and pleaſant in the hotteſt ſeaſon of the year. A profound tranquillity reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all the empire, Jehangire remained many months in Caſhmire. He went daily to the chace; and wandered, after a variety of rural pleaſures, over the face of that charming and flouriſhing country.

The refractory tributaries backed this violent meaſure with an army of ſixty thouſand horſe. They encamped at Ballapour. The chiefs of the confederates were Nizam-ul-Muluc, Adil Chan, and Cuttub. They were deſcended of the Mahommedan princes, who, at the fall of the Patan empire, had aſſumed the ſtate and independence of princes in the Decan.</p>

He gave him a commiſſion to command the Imperial army ſtationed in and near that city. The prince did not continue long at Agra. He marched, on the twentieth of Siffer, toward Brampour. His force conſiſted of forty thouſand horſe. Abdul Huſſein, an experienced officer, was his ſecond in command. Letters came to the prince, on his march, from the Imperial governor of Mando, that a conſiderable detachment of the enemy had croſſed the Nirbidda, and were laying waſte the country. Abdul Huſſein was immediately detached againſt them, with five thouſand horſe. That general came up with the plunderers, defeated them, ſlew many on the ſpot, and purſued the fugitives to the hills.

The Imperialiſts recovered their ſpirit, upon the prince's arrival with an army; and the hopes of the inſurgents began to vaniſh. Some petty Rajas, who had

joined the confederates, took the firſt opportunity of throwing themſelves at the feet of Shaw Jehân. They were pardoned, but obliged to pay the arrear of their tribute, which amounted to fifty lacks. The Mahommedan princes, being deſerted by the Hindoo Rajas, their troops mutinied, and diſſentions roſe in their councils. They ſeparated in diſguiſt and deſpair, each to his own territory. Shaw Jehân divided his army into five parts, and followed the rebels. In the ſpace of a few months, without any conſiderable action, he reduced the inſurgents to their former obedience; forcing them to pay the arrears of their tribute, which was now ſettled at the annual ſum of fifty-five lacks of roupees.</p>

Jehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire juſtly doubted his ſincerity, when he profeſſed, that it was a regard for a brother that induced him to wiſh to have Chuſero in his poſſeſſion. He knew the ambition of Shaw Jehân: he ſtill had an affection for Chuſero. Aſiph Jah, even the favourite Sultana had gone into the views of Shaw Jehân; but the emperor remained long inflexible. Shaw Jehân, for ſome time, ſeemed to drop his deſigns. He, in the mean time, grew daily in his father's eſteem; and Chuſero declined in proportion as his brother roſe. When the alarming news from the Decan arrived at Lahore, the emperor's hopes reſted all on Shaw Jehân. The artful prince, in the critical moment, renewed his requeſt, with regard to Chuſero, and he was delivered into his hands.</p>

He expatiated upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain fate of Shaw Jehân; and upon the doubtfulneſs of their own fortune, as connected with that prince. One Raja Bandor, a notorious villain, underſtood the meaning of Shaw Jehân's friend.

He immediately, with a numerous army, took the route of Delhi, where, at that time, his father reſided. The news of his march flew before him, and reached the ears of Jehangire. That monarch became anxious, irreſolute, and perplexed; and to complete the confuſion in his councils, advices were, at the ſame time, received, that Shaw Abas, king of Perſia, at the head of a great force, had ſurpriſed Candahar. The emperor was thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck at this double intelligence of approaching misfortune. The rebellious prince had the flower of the Imperial army under his command. Jehangire, as the laſt reſort, had recourſe to policy. Inſtead of arming for his own defence, he diffembled his knowledge of his ſon's intentions. He wrote him affectionate letters from day to day. He praiſed his former actions. He commended his preſent alacrity, in coming ſo expeditiouſly to his aid againſt the Perſian. Shaw Jehân was not to be flattered out of his deſigns. He ſaw through his father's policy, and he gradually advanced; but being overtaken by the rains, he was obliged to halt ſome months at Mando, the capital of the province of Malava.</p>

Etabâr Chan, who commanded the fortreſs, was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to riſk the treaſure on the road, as the news of Shaw Jehân's near approach was arrived. The importunities of Aſiph pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. Etabâr with a party eſcorted the treaſure: ſome of the enemy appeared in view. Etabâr immediately retired, with his convoy, to the caſtle of Agra; and Aſiph made the beſt of his way to Delhi. Shaw Jehân, immediately upon his arrival, ordered the caſtle to be aſſaulted; but Bickermajît, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the attack, was ſo warmly received, that he was glad to retire, with the loſs of five hundred men. The prince, enraged at this diſappointment, delivered up to plunder ſome of the nobility's houſes at Agra; and then took the rout of Delhi.</p>

A letter,  in the mean time, was brought to him from his rebellious ſon.

an edict declaring his ſon a rebel, ſhould he not diſband his army, and return to his duty, by a certain day. Another edict confiſcated all his eſtates, by recalling the grants which had been given him, for a magnificent ſubſiſtence. The eſtates were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Sultan Shariâr; who was, at the ſame time, invéſted with a commiſſion to carry on, with the utmoſt vigour, the Perſian war. Ruſtum Suffavi, an experienced and able officer, was placed next in command to the prince in the expedition. Ruſtum was himſelf a Perſian, a near relation to Shaw Abas, and deduced his paternal deſcent from the Imperial family of Suffvi.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Preparations againſt him.</note>The Imperial edicts made no impreſſion on Shaw Jehân. The emperor flew from the pen to the ſword. The troops ſtationed  near the capital flocked to his ſtandard: others joined him from the provinces. Aſiph Jah and the Sultana had foreſeen the ſtorm, and the adherents of the emperor were on their march to Delhi, when the rebel prince was on his route from the Decan. Jehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire, in a few days, ſaw forty thouſand horſe under his command.

He, therefore, alleged, that his demands had been made in ſo peremptory a

Aſiph Jah, the viſier, oppoſed this meaſure, by affirming that it was imprudent to riſque all, with a ſmall force, while reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were daily expected. The emperor ſuſpected his fidelity; and he had ſome reaſon. Aſiph was ſaid to have provided againſt all events, by keeping up a correſpondence with Shaw Jehân. His enemies affirmed, that it was his advice which haſtened the prince from the Decan; though this agrees but little with the preparations which Aſiph had made againſt Shaw Jehân from foreſeeing his rebellion. Jehangire, however, believed his miniſter guilty. He gave himſelf up to rage and deſpair.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His dream.</note>In the heat of his imagination upon the occaſion, he fell aſleep in his tent. He dreamed that he ſaw a pole fixed in the ground,  before the Imperial palace. On the top of the pole, which almoſt reached the ſkies, a meteor ſeemed to play, and to lighten the whole world with its ſplendor. An elephant came from the weſt and overturned the pole. The meteor fell and expired on the ground, leaving the whole earth in profound darkneſs. Jehangire ſtarted from his bed. Naturally ſuperſtitious, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw ſome coming evil in his dream. He related it, in the morning, to his Omrahs. None ventured to interpret it; and when they ſtood in ſilence in the preſence, a courier arrived, with advice that Mohâbet Chan, with all the forces of Punjâb, was at the diſtance of a few miles from the Imperial camp. This ſudden
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0828300200:229"/>
and unexpected reinforcement diffuſed an univerſal joy. The emperor cried out, That his dream was interpreted. Mohâbet joined the army in the evening; and private orders were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately iſſued to the officers to prepare for action by the dawn of day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">He prepares for battle.</note>The Imperial army was in motion while yet it was dark; and Shaw Jehân, apprized of their march, did not decline to engage.  He advanced apace. The two armies came in ſight of each other oppoſite to Tuglick-abad. The Imperialiſts were commanded in chief by Aſiph Jah, the viſier, who was poſted in the center. Mohâbet Chan had charge of the right wing; Nawaſis Chan, of the left. Abdalla commanded the advanced guards, conſiſting of three thouſand horſe. The Emperor himſelf ſtood behind the center; and to encourage the generals, ſent to each ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, as a mark of his confidence and favour.</p>

He retired to a ſmall diſtance; and Raja Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>majît marſhalled his troops in order of battle. The Raja placed himſelf in the center: Raja Bimé commanded the right, Darab Chan the left wing. The action was begun by the advanced guards on both ſides. Thoſe of Shaw Jehân were defeated, at the firſt onſet, by a ſtrange accident. Abdalla, who commanded the advanced guard of the Imperialiſts, ſpurring on his horſe among the enemy, with a few officers in the ſecret, joined the rebels. His troops, miſtaking their commander's perfidy for valour, ruſhed forward to ſupport him; and having engaged the enemy hand to hand, drove them back upon their own line.</p>

He preſſed forward with the center of the Imperialiſts, and came to  action with Raja Bickermajît. The ſhock was violent, and the battle continued obſtinate for ſome time. Both the commanders exerted themſelves to the utmoſt. At length the fortune of Aſiph prevailed. Raja Bickermajît fell, pierced through the head with an arrow. The center of the rebels immediately fled; and, at that inſtant, Mohâbet drove the left wing from the field. Raja Bimé, in the mean time, preſſed hard upon Nawaſis Chan, who commanded the right wing of the Imperialiſts. The duſt was ſo great, that the contending armies were involved in darkneſs. They felt for each other with their ſwords. Nawaſis was driven from the field. Many of his officers were killed, and ſome taken priſoners. Raja Bimé, imagining he was returning after a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory, fell in with the troops of Aſiph Jah. They mixed undiſtinguiſhed with each other. Slaughter and confuſion reigned. Wounds were inflicted at random. Chance governed all. Every individual conſidered himſelf as in the midſt of ten thouſand foes. The armies retreated to their camps. The field was left to the dead.</p>

Though both the emperor and Shaw Jehân had been kept out of the line at the beginning of the action, by the aſſiduity of their friends, when the battle became hot, they mixed with their reſpective armies. Bickermajît, obſerving the emperor, preſſed forward to ſeize him; but in the attempt was ſlain. The ſpirit of the rebels fell with their leader. Shaw Jehân preſented himſelf to the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways in vain. Neither threats nor promiſes would do. A panic had ſeized them; and though the prince cried aloud, That

He reſolved ſeriouſly to prevent future miſery and diſtreſs, by an  immediate death. His adherents, however, prevailed upon him to retreat. He fled to the mountains of Mewat; his army falling off as he fled. Jehangire was the more aſtoniſhed at his good fortune, the more it was unexpected. When the news of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla's treachery was brought him, he had given all over for loſt. He diſtruſted Aſiph Jah; and he ſent a meſſenger to recal him from the front, when that miniſter was upon the point of engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy. Fortunately for the emperor, the meſſenger did not come up to the viſier till the affair was decided. The latter obeyed Jehangire, and brought him the news of victory.</p>

Jehangire received him with an exceſs of joy. The victory over his rebellious ſon had elevated his ſpirits, and diſſipated all his fears. He ſent his ſeraglio before him to Agra; and raiſed Purvez, under the tuition of Mohâbet, to the command of the army. Shaw Jehân, in the mean time, with a few adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, purſued his way to the Decan; and Purvez was ordered to follow him with a conſiderable force.

                  <note place="margin">Affairs in the Decan.</note>We muſt, for a moment, loſe ſight of the prince, in the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of his adherents. The Emperor in his extreme affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Shaw Jehân, had, while yet he remained in his duty,  ſubmitted to his government an extenſive diviſion of the empire, conſiſting of ſeveral provinces. In that number was the rich king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Guzerat. Bickermajît, who was ſlain in the action near Delhi, had been governor of that province; and when he joined the prince in his expedition againſt his father, Suffvi Chan was left in the ſuperintendency of Guzerat. Abdalla, whoſe perfidy, in deſerting his ſovereign in the late battle, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, was rewarded, by the prince, for his treachery, with the government vacant by the death of Bickermajît. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave the prince in his diſtreſs, Abdalla diſpatches his friend Offâder Chan to command, in the mean time, in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Offâder arriving with a ſmall force at Ahmedabad, the capital, diſplaced Suffvi Chan, the Imperial governor. Suffvi fled to Hankſi. He wrote from thence to Naſir, the governor of Patan. Underſtanding that Suffvi was no ſtranger to the march of Sultan Dawir Buxſh the ſon of Chuſero, under the tuition of his maternal grandfather Chan Azem, to command for the emperor in Guzerat, Naſir blamed him for his flight. He met Suffvi, with a force at Caperbenîz. They reſolved to march to Ahmed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abad: and ſetting forward in the evening, they arrived next morning under the walls of the city. Dividing their forces into three bodies; each body attacked a gate. The elephants broke them open: the Imperialiſts entered, and Offâder was ſeized.</p>

News was brought to him in  that city, that Guzerat was loſt. He was much affected; but Abdalla made light of the matter. That Omrah marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ahmedabad with ſeven thouſand horſe. When he arrived
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0828300200:233"/>
at Waſſet, he found Suffvi, now the Imperial Suba, ready unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to receive him. This lord, finding that prince Dawir Buxſh and Chan Azem had lagged on their march, provided himſelf with an army. He poſted his forces about twelve miles from Ahmedabad. Abdalla endeavoured to turn his rear. He was prevented by the vigilance of Suffvi; and he, therefore, reſolved to come to battle. Dividing his army into three columns, he advanced, in that order, upon the enemy. Naſir Chan ſupported Suffvi, with his courage and conduct. The battle was obſtinate. Many officers of rank fell on the ſide of Abdalla. He was routed, with great ſlaughter. He fled to Surat. The country people cut off the greateſt part of the ſhattered remains of his followers in their retreat. He ſoon after, with a few troops, betook himſelf to Brampour.</p>

The diſturbances in Guzerat convinced Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hangire, that the flames of civil war could be only extinguiſhed by the total ruin of Shaw Jehân. He, therefore, ordered Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vez and Mohâbet, at the head of the Rajaputs, in the Imperial pay, to purſue the rebel and to take him alive. Shaw Jehân left Mando, with a reſolution to try his fortune in a battle. He paſſed the river Nirbidda and threw up works to defend the ford. He was, by this time, reduced to great diſtreſs. His adherents gradually deſerted him. He became tired of hoſtilities which promiſed no ſucceſs. He ſent to his brother Purvez, for very moderate terms. Purvez, by the advice of Mohâbet, amuſed him with hopes, without coming to any determined point. The uſual precautions were neglected on the ſide of Shaw Jehân; and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hâbet, who watched an opportunity, croſſed the river and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him in his camp.

Muchlis Chan, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial governor of that province, fled to Allahabad, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the prince. The gates of Patna, the capital, were left open to receive him. He kept his court in the Suba's palace. The Zemindârs crowded, from all quarters, into the city, made their ſubmiſſion, and, with preſents, obtained his favour. But what was of greater conſequence to the prince, Mubârick, governor of the impregnable fort of Rhotas, which had never been taken by force, came and preſented to him the keys. Shaw Jehân was exceedingly rejoiced at this piece of good fortune.

The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial army came up with Deria, who commanded one of the three diviſions of the rebels, at Manicpour. He was inſtantly defeated; and he fell back to Benâris. Abdalla, at the ſame time, evacuated Allahabad, and joined Shaw Jehân. A council of war was called. Their deliberation was ſhort. They reſolved to give immediate battle to Purvez and Mohâbet.</p>

his army on the banks of a brook called Toniſh. Abdalla com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the right wing; Naſir Chan the left; the prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took his poſt in the center. The advanced guards were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Raja Bimè: and the whole field was marſhalled by Sujait Chan, who was at the head of the reſerve in the rear. The artillery, under the direction of Rumi was drawn up in one place before the center, inſtead of being diſpoſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly along the line. The army of the rebels exceeded forty thouſand horſe: the Imperaliſts were more in number.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The army of Shaw Jehân</note>Mohâbet, in the mean time, was not idle. He formed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der  of battle the army of Prince Purvez.

The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his diſpoſition are not related.—The action was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the artillery on the ſide of Shaw Jehân. But more than a thouſand ſhot were expended before one took place: the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being yet at too great a diſtance, Mohâbet would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his artillery to play, till he was ſure of doing execution. The cannonade continued near an hour. Some of Rumi's guns were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, his men were driven from others. Shaw Jehân immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ordered his advanced guard to charge a body of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, who were coming forward, with haſty ſtrides, to ſeize his artillery. The two advanced parties fought with great bravery. Thoſe of Shaw Jehân at length gave ground. Raja Bimè, who commanded them, preferred death to flight.

who commanded the reſerve of the rebels, threw himſelf into the interval left by Shaw Jehân's retreat. He fought, for ſome time, with great bravery, and furniſhed the prince with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of rallying his broken ſquadrons. But Sujait was, in his turn, defeated; and driven back in great confuſion. Shaw Jehân advanced to the charge: but advice was brought him, that Naſir was defeated on the left; and that ſome of the enemy, who had paſſed his flanks, were ſeen advancing in his rear.</p>

Bengal, Behâr and Orixa fell into the hands of Purvez.

He was hunted, like a wild beaſt, from place to

place. All mankind were his enemies; and he was their foe. Where he thought he could not overcome, he fled: he ſpread devaſtation through places where he could prevail. He was, however, tired of rapine; worn down by contention and hoſtility. He wrote letters of compunction to his father. He enlarged on his own guilt; he even added, if poſſible, to his own wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and misfortune. Jehangire was often full of affection; he was always weak. He was ſhocked at the miſerable condition of a ſon, whom he once had loved.

Shaw Jehân embraced the offer with joy. He delivered up the forts; he ſent his children to Agra. He, however, found various pretences for not appearing in perſon at court.

                  <note place="margin">Mohâbet in high favour.</note>THE valour and abilities of Mohâbet, in conducting the war againſt Shaw Jehân, raiſed ſentiments of gratitude in the breaſt of Jehangire. His ſon, Channa Zâd, had been lately  gratified with the government of Cabul; and others, his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and friends, were advanced to lucrative and honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. The great victory near Benâris confirmed the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's high opinion of Mohâbet, and the news of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant event filled him with exceſſive joy. His grateful feelings for his general roſe in proportion to the decreaſe of his fears for his throne. Theſe ſentiments, however, did not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Mohâbet had a great many enemies: his ſovereign had but little firmneſs. The abilities of the former had raiſed envy; and nature had given to the latter a diſpoſition too eaſy and pliant, to be proof againſt miſrepreſentation. To explain the cauſes of an event which almoſt transferred the empire from the houſe of Timur to other hands, we muſt look back to ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances prior to this period.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Accuſed of intended treaſon.</note>Chan Chanan, mentioned as the tutor of Purvez, in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Candeiſh, had, through ſome diſguſt, attached him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the fortunes of Shaw Jehân, when that prince ſucceeded  his brother in the command of the Imperial army in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. It was by that lord's advice, that he cut off Chuſero: by his advice he rebelled againſt his father. He accompanied the prince in his expedition to Agra and Delhi; and, though he took no part in the fatigues of the field, he ruled in the cabinet. When the affairs of Shaw Jehân became deſperate, after his retreat to the Decan, he adviſed him to ſue for a pardon, through his brother Purvez. He himſelf undertook to be his meſſenger to Purvez, to whoſe temper and character he could have been no ſtranger. When he arrived in the Imperial camp, he found no diſpoſition in Mohâbet to relinquiſh by terms, the advantages which had been obtained by the ſword. Having failed in his endeavours for the prince, he applied for himſelf. Mohâbet was ſhocked at this reiteration of treachery; and he perſuaded Purvez to throw him and his family into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The latter were ſent, under an eſcort, to Agra; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was detained, in cloſe confinement, in the camp, and his eſtate was confiſcated by an Imperial edict.</p>

Purvez, who had a commiſſion from his father to govern the eaſtern provinces, conferred the ſuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Bengal upon Mohâbet, who ſent his ſon Channa Zâd, lately arrived in the army, to manage his government in his own abſence. Dara the ſon of Chan Chanan, had been made ſuba of Bengal, by Shaw Jehân. That young lord was ſeized by the people, and delivered into the hands of Channa Zâd, as ſoon as he arrived at the capital of the province. He immediately ſent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0828300200:244"/>
Dara to his father; who, having informed the emperor of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, received orders to put him to death, as an obſtinate rebel. Mohâbet obeyed, and ſent the unfortunate ſuba's head to Agra.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His enemies at court.</note>Chan Chanan, though confined in the camp of Purvez, found means, by letters, to inſinuate himſelf into the good graces of the Sultana, and her brother the viſier. The two laſt had been  long the enemies of Mohâbet; and the former imputed the death of his ſon to that lord, and was reſolved to revenge the injury. He wrote to the Sultana: he ſent letters to Aſiph. He informed them that Mohâbet was forming deſigns to raiſe Purvez to the throne. This was carried to the emperor's ears. He ordered Chan Chanan to be releaſed: and that Omrah, who remained with Purvez, accuſed Mohâbet, by letters to the emperor, of intended treaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The emperor alarmed.</note>Jehangire, naturally ſuſpicious, was alarmed. The ſpirit of  jealouſy and diſtruſt took poſſeſſion of his mind. He forgot the ſervices of Mohâbet in his own fears. He ordered him to court; and raiſed Chan Jehân Lodi from the government of Guzerat to the command of the army under Purvez. Mohâbet, before the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's orders arrived, had ſet out with Purvez, for Bengal. He had been guilty of a neglect, which gave colour to the accuſations of his enemies. The elephants taken in battle are Imperial property. Theſe he had retained, together with the preſents which his ſon Channa Zâd had received in reſettling the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. A ſecond peremptory order was ſent to him. He was acquainted, that he was appointed to the ſubaſhip of Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jâb; but that the emperor deprived him of Lahore, which had been uſually annexed to that government. He was thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck at the ſudden change in the emperor's mind. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to obey. He went to take his leave of Purvez. The

prince was cold and ſtately; and ſeemed to forget his friend in the diſpleaſure of his father.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Mohâbet commanded to court.</note>Senſible of his own abilities, conſcious of his honour, elevated  by his reputation in war, Mohâbet was diſguſted, beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, at this return for his ſervices. He reſolved to retire to his caſtle of Rintimpour: but an order arrived to deliver that fortreſs into the hands of one of the Sultana's creatures. This latter circumſtance confirmed what his friends at court had written to him before, that his life was in danger, ſhould he truſt himſelf in the Imperial preſence. He wrote to Jehangire. He expreſſed his aſtoniſhment at his diſpleaſure. He declared his perfect confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the honour of his prince; but he expreſſed his well-grounded diſtruſt of his adviſers. The letter produced nothing but an order for his immediate appearance at court. To refuſe was to rebel. He wrote again to the emperor. <q rend="inline">"I will," ſays he, "ſerve my ſovereign with my life againſt his enemies, but I will not expoſe it to the malice of his friends. Aſſure me of ſafety, and I will clear myſelf in the preſence."</q> Jehangire, upon receiving this letter, was enraged. He diſpatched a courier, with his laſt commands for his appearance. He at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to obey. Five thouſand Rajaputs, in the Imperial pay, from an affection for their general, offered him their ſervice to conduct him to court.

they were afraid of his force. They perſuaded the emperor not to admit him into the camp. When, therefore, he arrived near the tents, he was ordered to ſtop, till he accounted for the revenues of Bengal, and the plunder taken at the battle of Benâris. Mohâbet was enraged: he diſpatched his ſon-in-law to the emperor, to complain of an indignity ſo unworthy of his fidelity and ſervices. He could not have choſen a worſe meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. The emperor had been much offended with Mohâbet, for giving his daughter in marriage without his conſent; and he had reſolved to be revenged. When, therefore, the young lord alighted from his elephant in the Imperial ſquare, he was ſuddenly ſeized; he was ſtript of his clothes, covered with rags, baſtinadoed, and ſent out of the camp riding backward on a ſorry jade, amid the ſhouts of the whole army.</p>

He bore it with ſeeming pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. He was ſhocked at the weakneſs of the emperor, which had yielded ſo much to the malice of a vindictive woman. He ſeparated, by degrees, his retinue from the camp. He found he could not truſt himſelf in the hands of his enemies; and he took at once a bold reſolution. The emperor was on his march to Cabul, and he reſolved to watch his motions. He hovered, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night, round the ſkirts of the camp; and the morning preſented a favourable opportunity for the execution of his ſcheme.</p>

The advanced guard began to move over the bridge in the morning, and was gradually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the other troops. The emperor remained in the old

camp. He was not in an enemy's country, and he uſed no precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When the greateſt part of the army had paſſed, Mohâbet ſuddenly advanced with his faithful Rajaputs. He ſeized the bridge, and ſet it on fire; leaving two thouſand of his men under the command of his ſon, to defend the flames, and to ſtop the return of the enemy. Having made this diſpoſition, he rode with great ſpeed to the Imperial ſquare. He was firſt obſerved by the officers of the houſehold, paſſing by the haram in ſeeming diſorder. His countenance was pale, but determined. They were alarmed; and he ruſhed forward to the emperor's tent.</p>

                  <note place="margin">takes him</note>The writer of the Acbal Namma, who was then lord of the wardrobe, ſuſpecting that Mohâbet meant to aſſaſſinate the emperor,  drew his ſword, and followed him with great ſpeed. The Omrahs in waiting did the ſame. When they had advanced to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial tent, they found Mohâbet ſurrounded by five hundred Raja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts on foot, ſtanding at the door, with ſwords by their ſides and pikes in their hands. The lords were immediately ſeized and diſarmed. The emperor, hearing the noiſe and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without, cut his way through the ſcreens, and entered the bathing-tent, which was behind his ſleeping apartment. Mohâbet alighted and entered; not finding the emperor, he preſſed forward with forty Rajaputs, to the bathing-tent. Some of the Imperial guards ſtood at the door. The officer who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, ſternly aſked Mohâbet, Why he preſumed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude on the emperor's privacy? He anſwered him, by putting his hand upon his ſword and frowning upon him, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined countenance. A panic ſeized the guards. They made way for him to paſs.

His death was regretted, more, perhaps, than that of an abler man might have been. He never committed injuries, and mankind gave him credit for benevolence.

He reduced the kingdom of Guzerat; he defeated with twenty thouſand horſe, an army of ſeventy thouſand, under the confederate princes of the Decan. He was a ſcholar, as well as a ſoldier. He was the moſt learned man of his time: ſhrewd in politics, eloquent to a proverb. He tranſlated the commentaries of the emperor Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into the Perſic, from the Mogul language. He underſtood the Arabic, the Pehlvi, and all the dialects of India. He was alſo a good poet, and many of his pieces have come down to our time.

                  <note place="margin">Schemes of Mohâbet.</note>MOHABET, after his conference with Aſiph, made the beſt of his way to the dominions of the Rana. He had been recommended by letters from the viſier, to that prince; and he  was received with extraordinary marks of diſtinction. A cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, omitted in its place, will contribute to throw light on the ſequel. A correſpondence, by writing, between Mohâbet and Aſiph would be a meaſure full of peril to both. They had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſeize upon the accidents that might ariſe in the courſe of time, for the ſervice of Shaw Jehân. The viſier was to be the judge, as having the beſt acceſs to know the period fit for their purpoſe, from his reſidence at court and intimate knowledge of its affairs. Mohâbet left a ring in his hands, which, when it ſhould be ſent, was the ſignal for him to eſpouse openly the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the prince.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0828300200:262"/>
began to decline viſibly in his health. The proſpect of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diſſolution rendered it unneceſſary to wreſt from him by force a ſcepter which he was ſoon to reſign to death. Mohâbet remained quiet with the Rana; who, holding a friendly correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Shaw Jehân, took an opportunity of informing that prince, that his noble gueſt was no enemy to his cauſe.—Jehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire had, for ſeven years, been troubled with a ſlight aſthma. His diſorder increaſed toward the end of the preceding year; and he reſolved to make a progreſs to Caſhmire, for the benefit of the air. The autumn proved very ſevere in that elevated country. He was ſeized with a violent cold, which fell upon his lungs. The ſharpneſs and purity of the air rendered his breathing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. He complained of a kind of ſuffocation; and became impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <note place="margin">Oct. 27th.</note> under his diſorder. He commanded the camp to move, with ſlow marches, toward Lahore. He was carried in a litter as far as the town of Mutti, which ſtands about half way on the road from Caſhmire. At Mutti his difficulty of breathing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. He was growing worſe every day, and the army halted. On the ninth of November of the year 1627 he expired; having lived fifty-eight and reigned twenty-two lunar years and eight months.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>Jehangire was neither vicious nor virtuous in the extreme.  His bad actions proceeded from paſſion; and his good frequently from whim. Violent in his meaſures without cruelty, merciful without feeling, proud without dignity, and generous without acquiring friends. A ſlave to his pleaſures, yet a lover of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; deſtitute of all religion, yet full of ſuperſtition and vain fears. Firm in nothing but in the invariable rigour of his juſtice, he was changeable in his opinions, and often the dupe of thoſe whom he deſpiſed. Sometimes calm, winning, and benevolent, he gained the affections of thoſe who knew him not; at other
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0828300200:263"/>
times, moroſe, captious, reſerved, he became terrible to thoſe in whom he moſt confided. In public, he was familiar, complaiſant, and eaſy to all; he made no diſtinction between high and low; he heard, with patience, the complaints of the meaneſt of his ſubjects; and greatneſs was never a ſecurity againſt his juſtice: in private, he was thoughtful, cold, and ſilent; and he often clothed his countenance with ſuch terror, that Aſiph Jâh frequently fled from his preſence, and the Sultana, in the plenitude of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over him, was known to approach him on trembling knees. His affection for his children bordered on weakneſs. He was as forgetful of injuries as he was of favours. In war he had no abilities; he was fond of peace and tranquillity; and rather a lover than an encourager of the arts of eivil life. Naturally averſe to tyranny and oppreſſion, property was ſecure under his adminiſtration: he had no avarice himſelf to render him unjuſt, and he was the determined and implacable enemy of extortion in others. He was a man of ſcience and of literary abilities; and the memoris of his life, which he penned himſelf, do him more honour as a good writer, than the matter, as a great monarch. Upon the whole, Jehangire, though not a faultleſs man, was far from being a bad prince: he had an inclination to be virtuous, and his errors proceeded from a defect more than from a depravity of ſoul: His mother was thought to have introduced a tincture of madneſs into his blood; and an immoderate uſe of wine and opium rendered ſometimes frantic a mind naturally inflamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His private life and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</note>Though Jehangire was often ſerious and diſtant among his  domeſtics, he was fond of throwing off the character of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and of enjoying freely the converſation of his ſubjects. He often diſappeared in the evening from the palace, and dived into obſcure punch-houſes, to paſs ſome hours in drinking and talking with the lower ſort. He had no enemies, and he was under no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0828300200:264"/>
apprehenſions concerning the ſafety of his perſon. Being in the hall of audience, acceſſible to all ranks of men, after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the uſual ceremonies, he was often known in his nocturnal excurſions. But the people loved his familiar openneſs, and did not by rudeneſs abuſe the truſt repoſed in them by their prince. He often deſired his companions at the bowl to aſk no favours of him, leſt SELIM, in his cups, might promiſe what JEHANGIRE, in his ſober ſenſes, would not chuſe to perform. When the liquor began to inflame him, he was rather mad than intoxicated. He flew from one extreme of paſſion to another; this moment joyful, the next melancholy and drowned in tears. When in this ſituation, he was fond of arguing upon abſtruſe ſubjects. Religion was his favourite topic. He ſometimes praiſed the Mahommedan faith, ſometimes that of the Chriſtians; he was now a follower of Zoroaſter, and now of Brahma. In the midſt of theſe devout profeſſions, he would, ſometimes, as ſtarting from a dream, exclaim, That the prophets of all nations were impoſtors; and that he himſelf, ſhould his indolence permit him, could form a better ſyſtem of religion than any they had impoſed on the world. When he was ſober, he was diveſted of every idea of religion, having been brought up a Deiſt under the tuition of his father Akbar.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Scheme of eſtabliſhing a new faith.</note>The variety of opinions, on the ſubject of religion, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed  in India, occaſioned great uneaſineſs both to Jehangire and his father Akbar. The tenets of Mahommedaniſm, which the family of Timur had brought along with them into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, were the religion eſtabliſhed by law; but the majority of their ſubjects were of different perſuaſions. The followers of the Brahmin faith were the moſt numerous, and the next were the Perſian Guebres, who worſhipped the element of Fire, as the beſt repreſentative of God. The Chriſtians of Europe and of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0828300200:265"/>
poſſeſſed ſeveral factories in the principal cities and ports, and they wandered in purſuit of commerce over all the empire. The different opinions among all theſe ſects, on a ſubject which mankind reckon of the laſt importance, were the ſource of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, animoſities, and quarrels. Akbar was chagrined. He tolerated every religion; he admitted men of all perſuaſions into his confidence and ſervice; and he had formed ſerious thoughts of promulgating a new faith, which might reconcile the minds of all his ſubjects. He eſteemed himſelf as equal in abilities to Mahommed, and he had more power to enforce his doctrine. But, foreſeeing the diſtractions which this arduous meaſure might occaſion, he dropt his deſign; and, inſtead of eſtablishing a new faith, contented himſelf with giving no credit to any of the old ſyſtems of religion. Jehangire in his youth had imbibed his father's principles. He began to write a new code of divine law; but he had neither the auſterity nor the abilities of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. He ſhewed more wiſdom in relinquiſhing, than in forming ſuch a viſionary ſcheme.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His violence.</note>Jehangire was ſubject to violent paſſions upon many occaſions. Complaints againſt his nobles, and even againſt his favourite ſons,  were received with an eagerneſs, and a rage againſt the offenders, more eaſily imagined than deſcribed. When his mind was heated with a relation of oppreſſion, he often burſt out into a loud excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <q rend="inline">"Who in my empire has dared to do this wrong?"</q> His violence flew before the accuſation; and to name any perſon to him, was to convince him of his guilt. Shaw Jehân had been known, when in the greateſt favour, to have come trembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his father, at the accuſation of the meaneſt ſubject; and the whole miniſtry, and the ſervants of the court, frequently ſtood abaſhed, pale, diſtant, and in terror for themſelves, when a poor man in rags was relating his grievances to the emperor.</p>

                  <note place="margin">An inſtance</note>His exceſſive ſeverity in the execution of impartial juſtice, was the great line which marks the features of the character of Jehangire. He had no reſpect of perſons, when he animadverted  upon crimes. His former favour was obliterated at once by guilt; and he perſevered, with undeviating rigour, to revenge upon the great, the injuries done to the low. The ſtory of Seif Alla remains as a monument of his ſavage juſtice. The ſiſter of the favourite Sultana had a ſon by her huſband Ibrahim, the Suba of Bengal, who, from his tender years, had been brought up at court by the empreſs, who having no ſons by Jehangire, adopted Seif Alla for her own. The emperor was fond of the boy; he even often ſeated him upon his throne. At twelve years of age Alla returned to his father in Bengal. Jehangire gave him a letter to the Suba, with orders to appoint him governor of Burd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan. Alla, after having reſided in his government ſome years, had the misfortune, when he was one day riding on an elephant through the ſtreet, to tread by accident a child to death. The parents of the child followed Alla to his houſe. They loudly demanded an exemplary puniſhment on the driver; and the governor, conſidering it an accident, refuſed their requeſt, and ordered them to be driven away from his door. They abuſed him in very opprobrious terms; and Alla, proud of his rank and family, expelled them from the diſtrict of Burdwan.</p>

They called aloud for juſtice; and the emperor wrote a letter to Alla with his own hand, with peremptory orders to reſtore to the injured parents of the child their poſſeſſions, and to make them ample amends for their loſs and the fatigue of their journey. The pride of Alla was hurt, at the victory obtained over him; and inſtead of obeying the orders of his prince, he threw them into priſon,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0828300200:267"/>
till they made ſubmiſſions to him for their conduct. But as ſoon as they were releaſed, they travelled again to Lahore. Alla was alarmed, and wrote letters to the Sultana and Aſiph Jâh, to prevent the petitioners from being admitted into the preſence. They hovered to no effect, for ſome months, about the palace. They could not even come within hearing of the emperor, till one day, that he was taking his pleaſure in a barge upon the river. They preſſed forward through the crowd; and thrice called out aloud for juſtice. The emperor heard them, and he recollected their perſons. He ordered the barge to be rowed, that inſtant, to the bank; and, before he inquired into the nature of their complaint, he wrote an order for them to receive a penſion for life, from the Imperial treaſury. When they had explained their grievances, he ſaid not a word, but he commanded Alla to appear immediately at court.</p>

                  <note place="margin">in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</note>Alla obeyed the Imperial command; but he knew not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Jehangire, which that prince had locked up in his  own breaſt. The youth encamped with his retinue, the night of his arrival, on the oppoſite bank of the river; and ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to announce his coming to the emperor. Jehangire gave orders for one of his elephants of ſtate to be ready, by the dawn of day; and he at the ſame time directed the parents of the child to attend. He himſelf was up before it was light, and having croſſed the river, he came to the camp of Alla, and commanded him to be bound. The parents were mounted upon the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; and the emperor ordered the driver to tread the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate young man to death. But the driver, afraid of the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sultana, paſſed over him ſeveral times, without giving the elephant the neceſſary directions. The emperor, however, by his threats obliged him at laſt to execute his orders. He retired home in ſilence; and iſſued out his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

The Subas of provinces avoided oppreſſion, as the poor had a determined avenger of their wrongs, in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. He upon every occaſion affected the converſation of the lower ſort. They had immediate acceſs to his perſon; and he only ſeemed pleaſed, when he was humbling the pride of his nobles, upon the juſt complaints of the vulgar. He boaſted of his humanity, as well as of his juſtice. He had uſed to ſay, That a monarch ſhould even feel for the beaſts of the field; and that the birds of heaven ought to receive their due at the foot of the throne.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Dawir Buxſh raiſed to the throne.</note>As ſoon as Jehangire expired, Aſiph, at the head of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial retinue, proceeded with the body to Lahore. When he  arrived on the banks of the Gelum, he diſpatched a Hindoo named Narſi, with the ring to Mohâbet, as the ſignal for that lord to eſpouſe the cauſe of Shaw Jehân. The will of Jehangire had been opened immediately upon his demiſe. He had, at the inſtigation of the Sultana, named his fourth ſon Shariâr, as his ſucceſſor in the throne; but that prince had, ſome weeks before, ſet out for Lahore. When the news of the death of Jehangire arrived at that city, the prince ſeized upon the Imperial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and encouraged the troops to join him, by ample donations. The viſier was alarmed. To gain time for the execution of his deſigns in favour of Shaw Jehân, he proclaimed Dawir Buxſh, the ſon of prince Chuſero, emperor of the Moguls. His

Being ill of a venereal diſorder himſelf, he  appointed Baiêſâr, the ſon of his uncle, the prince Daniâl, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his army. The troops of Aſiph were inferior in number to thoſe of Shariâr; but they were, in ſome meaſure, diſciplined, and inured to the field. Shariâr had croſſed the Gelum before the arrival of Aſiph; who drew up his forces upon the firſt appearance of the enemy. It was rather a flight than a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The raw troops of Shariâr gave way, before they came to blows. He was not himſelf in the action: he ſtood on a diſtant hill, and fell in into the current of retreat. He ſhut himſelf up in the citadel of Lahore; which was inveſted the next day by the army of Aſiph. The friends of Shariâr deſerted him; and made terms for themſelves. The unfortunate prince hid himſelf in a cellar within the haram. He was found, and dragged to the light by Feroſe Chan; and Alliverdi bound his hands with his girdle, and brought him to Dawir Buxſh. He was ordered to be confined; and the ſecond day he was deprived of ſight.</p>

He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the prince of the death of Jehangire; and acquainted Mohâbet of the plan, formed by the viſier, to ſecure the throne for the former; and that Dawir Buxſh was only raiſed, as a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary bulwark againſt the deſigns of the Sultana, and to appeaſe the people, who were averſe to Shariâr. Shaw Jehân, by the

He had detached a part of his army to ſeize Malava, and all the Imperial territories bordering upon that province. The meſſenger of Shaw Jehân was received with coldneſs. The anſwer given him was undeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and evaſive; and he was diſmiſſed without any marks either of reſentment or favour.

Caſſim, the governor of Agra, came with the keys, and touched the ground with his forehead before the emperor; who entered the city the next day, amid the acclamations of the populace.

                  <note place="margin">State of Perſia and Uſbekian Tartary.</note>The ſtate of Perſia ſuffered no change during the reign of the  emperor Jehangire in Hindoſtan. Shaw Abas, ſirnamed the Great, who was in his twentieth year on the throne of the family of Seifi at the death of Akbar, outlived Jehangire. He covered with ſplendid exploits, and a rigorous adherence to juſtice, the natural ſeverity and even cruelty of his character; and acquired the reputation of a great, though not of an amiable prince. The Uſbec Tartars of Great Bucharia, who had made encroachments on the Perſian dominions during the interrupted reigns of the immediate predeceſſors of Abas, loſt much of their conſequence in the time of that victorious prince. Domeſtic troubles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the ſucceſſion converted the weſtern Tartary into a ſcene of blood; and offered an object of ambition to Abas. He invaded Choraſſan; he beſieged the capital Balick, but he was obliged to retreat, by the activity and valour of Baki, who had poſſeſſed himſelf, after various viciſſitudes of fortune, of the throne of the Uſbecs. Baki, dying in the third year of his reign,

was ſucceeded by his brother Walli; who being expelled by his uncle, took refuge, with many of the nobles, in the court of Shaw Abas. The Perſian aſſiſted him with an army. He was ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in many engagements, defeated his uncle's forces, and took the city of Bochara; but his fortune changed near Samarcand, and he fell in a battle, which he loſt. The views of Abas, on the weſtern dominions of the Uſbecs, which had formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Perſia, fell with his ally Walli.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note>THE ideas upon government which the Tartars of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Aſia carried into their conqueſts in Hindoſtan, were often fatal to the poſterity of Timur. Monarchy deſcends through  the channel of primogeniture; but deſpotiſm muſt never fall into the hands of a minor. The prince is the center of union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the members of the ſtate; and, when he happens to be a child, the ties which bind the allegiance of the ſubject are diſſolved. Habituated to battle, and inured to depredation, the Tartars always adopted for their leader, that perſon of the family of their princes who was moſt proper for their own mode of life; and loſt ſight of hereditary ſucceſſion in the convenience of the nation. When they ſettled in better regions than their native country, they did not lay aſide a cuſtom ſuited only to incurſion and war. The ſucceſſion to the throne was never determined by eſtabliſhed rules; and a door was opened to intrigue, to murder, and to civil war. Every prince, as if in an enemy's country, mounted the throne through conqueſt; and the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0828300200:275"/>
ſafety of the ſtate, as well as his own, forced him, in a manner, to become an aſſaſſin, and to ſtain the day of his acceſſion with the blood of his relations. When therefore the Deſpot died, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was not the only ſource of broils among his ſons. They contended for life as well as for the throne; under a certainty that the firſt muſt be loſt, without a poſſeſſion of the ſecond. Self-preſervation, that firſt principle of the human mind, converted frequently the humane prince into a cruel tyrant, and thus neceſſity prompted men to actions, which their ſouls perhaps abhorred.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Acceſſion of Shaw Jehân.</note>Shaw Jehân had this apology for the murder of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;  and the manners of the people were ſo much adapted to an idea of neceſſity in ſuch a caſe, that they acquieſced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring under his government. He mounted the throne of the Moguls in Agra, on the firſt of February of the year 1628 of the Chriſtian Aera; and, according to the pompous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eaſtern princes, aſſumed the titles of THE TRUE STAR OF THE FAITH, THE SECOND LORD OF THE HAPPY CONJUNC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS, MAHOMMED, THE KING OF THE WORLD. He was born at Lahore on the fifth of January 1592, and, on the day of his acceſſion, he was thirty-ſix ſolar years and twenty-eight days old. To drive away the memory of the late aſſaſſinations from the minds of the people, and to gratify the nobles, who had crowded from every quarter to Agra, he uſhered in his reign with a feſtival, which exceeded every thing of the kind known in that age, in magnificence and expence. The pompous ſhews of the favourite Sultana, in the late reign, vaniſhed in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior grandeur of thoſe exhibited by Shaw Jehân.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Promotions.</note>In the midſt of feſtivity and joy, Shaw Jehân did neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the ſtate nor the gratitude which he owed to his friends.  Aſiph Jâh, though not yet arrived from Lahore, was confirmed in the office of viſier. His appointments to ſupport the dignity
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0828300200:276"/>
of his ſtation, and as a reward for the part he acted, in ſecuring the poſſeſſion of the throne to the emperor, amounted to near a million ſterling. Mohâbet who, in Shaw Jehân's progreſs from the Decan to Agra, had been preſented with the government of Ajmere, was raiſed to the high office of captain-general of all the forces, and to the title and dignity of Chan Chanan, or firſt of the nobles. His ſon Chanazâd, who had been raiſed to the title of Chan Zimân, was placed in the government of Malava. Behâr was conferred on Chan Alum, Bengal on Caſim, Allaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bâd on Janſapar Chan. The emperor, in beſtowing the province of Cabul on Liſcâr, exhibited an inſtance of juſtice. He had, during his rebellion, taken eight lacks of roupees by force from that Omrah, and when he appointed him to Cabul, he at the ſame time gave him a draught on the treaſury for the money; ſignifying to Liſcâr, <q rend="inline">"That neceſſity being removed, there was no excuſe for the continuance of injuſtice."</q> Fifty Mahommedan nobles, together with many Indian Rajas, were raiſed to honours, and gratified with preſents.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Aſiph arrives at Agra.</note>During theſe tranſactions at Agra, Aſiph purſued his journey  in very ſlow marches from Lahore. His ſiſter, the favourite of the late emperor, being ruined in all her ſchemes of ambition, was left, in a kind of conſinement at Lahore, in the Imperial palace. The four ſons of the reigning emperor, Dara, Suja, Aurungzêbe, and Morâd, had been ſent as hoſtages for their father's good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to Jehangire. They were in the Imperial camp when that monarch expired; and Aſiph treated them with kindneſs and reſpect. He arrived at Agra on the twenty-ſecond of March, and preſented his ſons to the emperor, when he was celebrating the feſtival of the Noroſe, which is kept by the followers of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed at the vernal equinox in every year. The emperor was ſo much rejoiced at the ſight of his children, who had been all
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0828300200:277"/>
born to him by his favourite wife the daughter of Aſiph, that he conferred upon their grandfather, the pompous title of THE FATHER OF PRINCES, THE STRENGTH OF THE REALM, AND PROTECTOR OF THE EMPIRE.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Children of the emperor.</note>The Imperial prince Dara Shêko was thirteen years old at the  acceſſion of his father to the throne; Suja was in the twelfth, Aurungzêbe in the tenth, and Morâd in the fourth lunar year of his age. The eldeſt of the emperor's children, by the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Sultana, the daughter of Aſiph, was the princeſs Jehânara, which name ſignifies THE ORNAMENT OF THE WORLD. She was fourteen years of age when Shaw Jehân mounted the throne. Senſible, lively and generous, elegant in her perſon, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in her mind, ſhe obtained an abſolute empire over her father. A ſimilarity of diſpoſition with the open and ſincere Dara, attached her to the intereſt of that prince; and he owed, in a great meaſure, the favour of his father to her influence. Roſhenrai Begum, or THE PRINCESS OF THE ENLIGHTENED MIND, was the ſecond daughter of Shaw Jehân, and his fourth child by the favourite Sultana. Her wit was ſharp and penetrating, her judgment ſound, her manner engaging like her perſon; ſhe was full of addreſs, and calculated for ſtratagem and intrigue. She reſembled the pervading genius of Aurungzêbe, and ſhe favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deſigns. The emperor's third daughter was Suria Bânu, or THE SPLENDID PRINCESS; a name ſuited to her exquiſite beauty. She was eaſy and gentle in her temper, ſoft and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her addreſs, humane, benevolent and ſilent: averſe to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and art, full of dignity and honourable pride. She took no part in the intrigues which diſturbed the repoſe of the ſtate, devoting her time to the accompliſhments of her ſex, and a few innocent amuſements.</p>

                  <note place="margin">State of the empire.</note>Shaw Jehân found himſelf in the peaceable poſſeſſion of the extenſive empire of his father, and he had abilities to govern it with dignity, juſtice and preciſion. Tranquillity was eſtabliſhed  at home; and there were no enemies to diſturb him from abroad. Shaw Abas ſoon after died in Perſia; and the ſcepter fell into the weak and inactive hands of his grandſon Seſi; a prince, incapable of either governing his ſubjects with dignity, or of giving any diſturbance to his neighbours. The ſpirit of the Uſbecs had declined; and they were exhauſted by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſucceſſions and civil wars. The Indian nations, beyond the pale of the empire, were peaceable and unwarlike: incapable of committing injuries, and too diſtant from the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive them. The Portugueze, though the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful European nation in India, were not formidable to the empire, though hated by the prince. Shaw Jehân, when in arms againſt his father, had ſolicited their aſſiſtance. They had not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him their aid, but, in a manly manner, reproached him for having demanded it againſt his parent and ſovereign. He was ſenſible of the juſtice of the reproof, and therefore could not forgive it. The Sultana was their enemy. She had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her huſband to one of their ſettlements; and ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged beyond meaſure againſt them for the worſhip they paid to images.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lodi ſubmits.</note>The diſreſpect ſhewn by Lodi who commanded in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, to Niſhar Chan the emperor's meſſenger, produced a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceding  commiſſion to the latter againſt the former. Niſhar produced the Imperial mandate: but Lodi would not obey. Mohâbet was ordered with a force againſt the refractory general; and Niſhar, on account of his not having acted with a proper ſpirit, was recalled. Chan Zimân, from his government of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lava, marched with all his forces to the aid of his father Mohâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0828300200:279"/>
Lodi was ſoon reduced to extremities. He ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Mohâbet, with a requeſt of his mediation with the emperor, explaining away his conduct, by the difficulty of decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in favour of the reigning emperor againſt the will of Jehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire. <q rend="inline">"But now," continues he, "that Shaw Jehân remains alone of the poſterity of Timur, Lodi cannot heſitate to obey his commands."</q> Theſe letters were received by Mohâbet before things came to open hoſtility. He tranſmitted them to Agra, and Lodi was reſtored, in appearance, to favour.</p>

He looked upon a civil war as a certain event in India; and he reſolved to ſeize on the opportunity preſented by Fortune. He ordered ten thouſand of his beſt horſe under Nidder Mahommed, accompanied with a good train of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, to penetrate into the province of Cabul. That general entered the Imperial dominions, and laid ſiege to the fortreſs of Zohâc. But the place was ſo ſtrong, and ſo well defended by Zingis, who commanded the garriſon, that Mahommed, after ſuffering a conſiderable loſs, raiſed the ſiege. The Uſbecs, however, did not retreat to their own country. Mahommed, after being repulſed at Zohâc, attempted to ſurprize Cabul, and, having failed in the enterprize, he ſat down before that city.</p>

They ſoon advanced  their batteries to the counterſcarp of the ditch, and, by a conſtant fire, made ſeveral breaches in the wall. Ziffer, the late Suba, had left the place; and Liſcâr, the new governor, was not yet arrived. The command of the garriſon was in Jacob Chan; who defended himſelf ſo well, that the enemy was beat back with great loſs in

a general aſſault. Mahommed, though repulſed, was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. He raiſed, with great labour, mounds to command the walls; and drove the beſieged from the rampart. The breach, however, had been repaired, and the Uſbecs durſt not attempt to ſcale the walls.</p>

Having left his ſon in his command in the ſouth, Mohâbet haſtened with all expedition to the north. Twelve thouſand horſe attended him; and he was to take up the forces of Punjâb on his way. The ſiege had now continued three months; the Uſbecs had again made a practicable breach, and the ditch was almoſt filled, when the news of the march of Mohâbet arrived in the camp of Mahommed. He redoubled his diligence; and the garriſon, who knew nothing of ſuccour, began to deſpair. When, therefore, the Uſbecs began to prepare for a ſecond general aſſault, the beſieged ſallied out with all their forces. The battle was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and bloody; but Mahommed was at length obliged to give way; and the garriſon hung on his heels beyond the frontiers of the province. Mohâbet, upon the news of this defeat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Agra; and civil conteſts took up the attention of the Uſbecs at home.</p>

The Indian prince of that country, whoſe name was Hidjâr Singh, having come to pay his reſpects at the court of Agra, found that an addition was made, in the books of the Imperial treaſury, to the tribute which he and his anceſtors had formerly paid to the houſe of Timur. Inſtead of petitioning for an abatement of the impoſt, he fled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

taking leave of the emperor. When he arrived in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he armed his dependants to the number of fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. He garriſoned his fortreſſes, and occupied the paſſes which led to his country. The emperor was enraged at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of this petty chieftain. He ordered Mohâbet to enter his country with twelve thouſand horſe and three thouſand foot, by the way of Gualiâr. Lodi, lately received into favour, with twelve thouſand more, was commanded to invade Bundel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund from the ſouth; and Abdalla, with ſeven thouſand horſe, from the eaſt, by the way of Allahabâd. Theſe three armies, under three experienced and able officers, were more than neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſervice; but the emperor was deſirous to ſhew an inſtance of vigour at the commencement of his reign, to raiſe the terror of his diſpleaſure, and to eſtabliſh tranquillity and good order by the means of fear.</p>

Shaw Jehân was rigid to an extreme; and his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity gave always place to policy. He ordered the unfortunate prince into confinement, intimating that a warrant ſhould ſoon be iſſued for his execution. Mohâbet, who admired the intrepid conſtancy of the Raja, ſhewed an inclination to intercede for his life; but the ſtern looks of the emperor impoſed ſilence upon him. He, however, the next day carried his priſoner into the preſence: the rigid darkneſs of Shaw Jehân's countenance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; and the captain-general ſtood at a diſtance, in cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Raja. The emperor ſaw them; but he was ſilent. The prince, and even Mohâbet, deſpaired of ſucceſs. They came the third day into the preſence, and ſtood, as uſual, at a diſtance. The Raja was in fetters, and Mohâbet chained his own hand to that of the priſoner. <q rend="inline">"Approach, Mohâbet," ſaid Shaw Jehân.

This change in the government of the frontier provinces was productive of diſturbances. The Nizam of Golconda, who had been kept quiet by the reputation of Mohâbet and his ſon, invaded, upon the departure of the latter, the Imperial province of Candeiſh.

An edict of indemnity had been promulgated to all the Omrahs who had oppoſed the acceſſion of Shaw Jehân to the throne; and Lodi thought that there was no probability of his being excluded from the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence granted to others.

The uſher, in a rage, ſtruck Azmut over the head with his rod, and inſiſted upon his throwing himſelf again on the ground. Azmut, full of fire and valour, drew his ſword. He aimed a blow at the uſher's head; but one of the mace-bearers warded it off, and ſaved his life.</p>

Huſſein, his other ſon, followed his father's example. The tumult encreaſed, and the emperor leapt from his throne. Lodi and his ſons ruſhed out of the preſence.

Their houſe was contiguous to the palace; and they ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up, with three hundred dependants. The houſe being incloſed with a ſtrong wall, no impreſſion could be made upon it without artillery; and as a ſiege ſo near the gates of the palace would derogate from the majeſty of the emperor, Shaw Jehân endeavoured to entice Lodi to a ſurrender, by a promiſe of pardon. His friends at court, however, acquainted him, that that there was a reſolution formed againſt his life; and he reſolved to make his eſcape, or to die in the attempt.</p>

His wives ſaw his grief, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. They conſulted together in an inner apartment. Their reſolution was noble, but deſperate; they raiſed their hands againſt their own lives. The groans reached the ears of Lodi. He ruſhed in; but there was only one taper burning, which, in his haſte, he overturned and extinguiſhed. He ſpoke, but none anſwered. He ſearched around, but he plunged his hand in blood. He ſtood in ſilence a while; and one of his ſons having brought a light, diſcovered to his eyes a ſcene of inexpreſſible horror. He ſaid not a word; but the wildneſs of his eyes was expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the tempeſt which rolled in his mind. He made a ſignal to his two ſons, and they buried the unfortunate women in the garden. He hung for ſome time in ſilence over their common grave. Then ſtarting at once from a profound reverie, he iſſued forth in a ſtate of horror and deſpair. He ordered his drums to be beaten, his trumpets to be ſounded. His people gathered around him. They mounted their horſes in the court-yard, and he himſelf at once threw open the gate. He iſſued out with his two

Lodi, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out halting, rode forward near forty miles. He was ſtopt by the river Chunbil, which was ſo high, ſo rough and rapid, on account of the rains, that he could not ſwim acroſs it, and all the boats had been carried down by the ſtream. This was an unexpected and terrible check; but as the weather was now fair, he hoped that the torrent would ſoon fall; and in that expectation, he and his followers ſtood on the bank. In the midſt of his anxiety, the Imperial troops appeared. He called his people together, and told them, he was reſolved to die in arms. There was a paſs behind him, which opened between two hills into a narrow plain. He took immediate poſſeſſion of the paſs; the river, which had cut off all hopes of flight, ſerved to cover his rear.</p>

The ſhock was violent; and the ſlaughter, on both ſides, was as great and expeditious, as the ſmall place in which they engaged would permit. Huſſein had a reſource in numbers; Lodi had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in which he could conſide but his valour. Scarce one hundred of his men now remained unhurt; he himſelf was

The latter action was ſo ſhort, that it was over before Lodi and Huſſein had extricated themſelves from the ſtream. When they aſcended the oppoſite bank of the river, they looked back with anxiety for Azmut; but Azmut was no more to be ſeen:

The Imperialiſts, however, being at length haraſſed by long marches, bad roads, and continual ſkirmiſhing, gave over the purſuit. Lodi remained a few days at Bundela, then he traverſed the provinces of Berâr and Odipour, in his rout to Golconda, and preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the Nizâm at Dowlatabad.

The more noble and generous paſſions of his mind were now up in arms.

He foreſaw a ſtorm in that quarter, ſhould time be given to Lodi to reconcile the jarring intereſts of princes, who were the avowed enemies of the houſe of Timur. Shaw Jehân was naturally provident. He judged of futurity by the paſt; and he was rapid in deciſion.

He placed himſelf at the head of one hundred thouſand horſe; which, together with infantry, artillery and attendants, increaſed the number of the army to three hundred thouſand men. He advanced toward the Decan; and the governors of the provinces through which he paſſed, fell in with their forces into his line of march. On the borders of Chandeiſh, he was met by Eradit Chan, the Suba of the province, who conducted him to his own reſidence, the city of Brampour. The emperor encamped his army in the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of Brampour; and diſpatched meſſengers to the tributary princes of the Decan. The principal of theſe were, Adil ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of Bejapour, Kuttub, who ſtyled himſelf king of Hydrabad and Tellingana, and the Nizam prince of Golconda. He threatened them with utter deſtruction ſhould they not come perſonally to make their ſubmiſſion, after having diſbanded the armies which they had raiſed to ſupport the rebellion of Lodi. He alſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them, either to deliver up or expel the man who had, by encouraging their ſchemes, projected their ruin.

The terror of the Imperial army had made each prince unwilling to quit his own dominions, leſt they ſhould become the theatre of invaſion and war. They ſaw the ſtorm gathering, but they knew not where it was to fall: and when they were afraid of all quarters, they took no effectual means for the defence of any. They were beſides divided in their councils. Ancient jealouſies and recent injuries were remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the good of the whole was forgot. Diſtruſt prevailed, indeciſion and terror followed; and the unfortunate Lodi, in ſpite of his activity, his zeal and abilities, found but ſmall ground on which he could reſt his hopes.</p>

He reſolved upon revenge. The Nizam, as being the firſt who had received Lodi under his protection, was the firſt object of his reſentment. He raiſed Eradit, the governor of Chandeiſh, to the title of Azim Chan, and ſubmitted an army of twenty-five thouſand men to his command. The force was not judged ſufficient for the reduction of the Nizam; but the emperor would not truſt Eradit with the abſolute command of a more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army. He fell upon the expedient of detaching two other armies, conſiſting each of fourteen thouſand horſe, under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate commands of Raja Gop Singh and Shaiſta Chan. Theſe two generals were to act in conjunction with Eradit, but they were not abſolutely under his orders.

The Raja of Naſic had inſulted Shaw Jehân in his exile and misfortunes; nor did he ever forget an injury which affected his pride. The Hindoo prince ſuffered for his inſolence; his country being, without mercy, ſubjected to fire and ſword. The emperor told Huſſein at parting: <q rend="inline">"The Raja of Naſic liſtened not to me in my diſtreſs; and you muſt teach him how dangerous it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult a man, that may one day be ſovereign of the world."</q> The expreſſion alluded to his own name; but a jeſt was unfit for the tragedy which was acted in the deſolated country of Naſic.</p>

That province  lying contiguous to Golconda, Bakîr had received orders to make a diverſion on that ſide. He accordingly had marched with a conſiderable force; and found the ſide of the country neareſt to Oriſſa uncovered with troops. He laid ſiege to Shud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Shikeriſt, Chizduar and Berimal, places of great ſtrength in Golconda; and they fell ſucceſſively into his hands.

Though he directed all the motions of the armies, he was not forgetful  of the civil government of his vaſt empire. With a juſtice which bordered on ſeverity, he quaſhed all petty diſturbances through his dominions. He inquired minutely into every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. He heard all complaints againſt his own officers; and when the people were aggrieved, he removed them from their employments. Nor was he, in the midſt of public buſineſs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent of that grandeur and magnificence which, by raiſing awe in his ſubjects, gave weight to his commands. He ſelected a hundred out of the ſons of the nobility, who were of the moſt diſtinguiſhed merit, and created them Omrahs in one day. He gave to each a golden mace, and they were, by their inſtitution, always to attend the preſence. They were all uniformly dreſſed in embroidered cloaths, with golden helmets, ſwords inlaid, and ſhields ſtudded with gold.

Six Omrahs of rank fell on the Imperial ſide; but Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit having formed his army in order of battle, Lodi thought proper to give way, and to ſhelter himſelf in the hills.

Nor was the expedition under Raw Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton into Tellingana attended with more ſucceſs than that under Eradit. The general was inactive, and the army weak.

Lodi, after his defeat, made the beſt of his way to Dowlatabâd, with an intention of throwing himſelf into that capital, to defend it to the laſt extremity. He was too late by ſome hours: Eradit was in the city. He fled, and took poſſeſſion of a paſs near Dowlatabâd, where he defended himſelf till night, againſt the whole force of the Imperialiſts. He eſcaped in the dark, and wandered over Golconda. The army of the Nizam had, by this time, thrown themſelves into the fortreſſes, and the open country was over-run by the enemy. To complete the misfortunes of that prince, his nobles daily deſerted him, with their adherents, and joined Shaw Jehân.

When her huſband aſcended the throne, he dignified her with the title of Mumtâza Zemâni, or, THE MOST EXALTED OF THE AGE. Though ſhe ſeldom interfered in public affairs, Shaw Jehân owed the empire to her influence with her father. Nor was he ungrateful: he loved her living, and lamented her when dead. Calm, engaging, and mild in her diſpoſition, ſhe engroſſed his whole affection: and though he maintained a number of women for ſtate, they were only the ſlaves of her pleaſure. She was ſuch an enthuſiaſt in Deiſm, that ſhe ſcarce could forbear perſecuting the Portugueſe for their ſuppoſed idolatry; and it was only on what concerned that nation, ſhe ſuffered her temper, which was naturally placid, to be ruffled. To expreſs his reſpect for her memory, the emperor raiſed at Agra, a tomb to her name, which coſt in building the amazing ſum of ſeven hundred and fifty thouſand pounds.</p>

An extraordinary drought, which burnt up all vegetables, dried up the rivers, and rent the very ground, occaſioned a dreadful famine. The Imperial camp could not be ſupplied with proviſions: diſtreſs prevailed over the whole face of the empire. Shaw Jehân remitted the taxes in many of the provinces, to the amount of three millions ſterling; he even

The ſcarcity of proviſions prevailed in Perſia: the famine raged with ſtill greater violence in the Weſtern Tartary. No rain had fallen for ſeven years in that country.

Looking from the thicket into the narrow plain where the fugitives lay, they perceived, to their aſtoniſhment, a number of men richly dreſſed, ſleeping on the ground; and fine horſes ſtanding near, with furniture of ſilver and gold. The temptation was too great to be withſtood by men who had never ſeen ſo much wealth before. They ruſhed upon the ſtrangers; and ſtabbed them in their ſleep. While they were yet dividing the ſpoil, Nuſerit came. The robbers were ſlain; and the head of the Raja was brought back to the army, which Nuſerit had left under the command of Aurungzêbe.

But the ſtrength of Dowlatabâd was not proof againſt treachery. Fatté, the ſon of Maleck Amber, who was the governor, ſold it to Mohâbet for a ſum of money, and an annual penſion of twenty-five thouſand pounds, ſecured on the Imperial treaſury.</p>

The delivery of the Nizâm into the hands of the Imperial general, was one of the conditions impoſed on Fattè for the bribe which he received. The prince was carried to Agra.

He delighted to encourage him in the martial exerciſes, which the prince ardently loved; and though he did not abate in his regard for his other ſons, they repined at the preference given to Aurungzêbe.

The whole empire rung with his praiſe; and the action was celebrated in verſe by Saib Selim, the beſt poet of the age. The prince Suja, naturally high-ſpirited and jealous, ſhewed violent ſigns of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content at the preference given to Aurungzêbe. He began to look upon his younger brother as deſigned for the throne; and his haughty mind could not endure the thought. He wiſhed to be abſent from a ſcene which gave him uneaſineſs; and he prevailed on Mohâbet to write to the emperor, requeſting that he ſhould be ſent to him to the Decan. Shaw Jehân conſented. Suja was created an Omrah of five thouſand horſe; and, having received ſixty thouſand pounds for his expences from the treaſury, he took leave of his father.</p>

Dara would not be ſatisfied with theſe reaſons; and the emperor, to make him eaſy, gave him the command of ſix thouſand horſe. The prince, however, could not forget the prior honours of Suja. He was told that Mohâbet deſigned that prince for the throne; and there were ſome grounds for ſuſpicion on that head.

Mohâbet ſat down before Bizida; but the garriſon defended the place with ſuch obſtinacy, that the Imperialiſts made little progreſs. The warm valour of Suja could not brook delay. He attributed to the inactivity of Mohâbet, what proceeded from the bravery of the enemy, and the ſtrength of the place. He raiſed by his murmuring a diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the officers of the army. Mohâbet remonſtrated againſt the behaviour of Suja; and gave him to underſtand, that he himſelf, and not the prince, commanded the troops. Suja was obſtinate. Mohâbet ſent expreſſes to court, and the prince was recalled. He was enraged beyond meaſure at this indignity; but it was prudent to obey. He left the camp; and Mohâbet, falling ſick, was obliged to raiſe the ſiege.

His abilities ſeemed to riſe with the occaſion; and Fortune could preſent nothing in battle which his prudence had not foreſeen. In his political character, he was bold in his reſolves, active and determined in execution. As his own ſoul was above fear, he was an enemy to cruelty; and he was ſo honeſt himſelf, that he ſeldom ſuſpected others.

He attempted high and arduous things, rather from a love of danger than from ambition; and when he had attained the ſummit of greatneſs, and might have reſted there, he deſcended the precipice, becauſe it was full of peril. Jehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire owed twice to him his throne; once to his valour, and once to his moderation; and his name gave the empire to Shaw Jehân, more than the friendſhip of Aſiph Jâh.</p>

The diſpute was carried ſo high between theſe two great men in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the reign of Shaw Jehân, that it was agreed they ſhould not come to court on the ſame day. The emperor did not chuſe to interfere in the conteſt: they were both his benefactors, both were powerful in the ſtate; and it would not be prudent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige one, by giving preference to the claims of the other.

The prince Aurungzêbe attended his father on this expedition, and was highly in favour. He propoſed, with a youthful ardor which pleaſed the emperor, to take a circuit with the Imperial camp, through the province of Bundela, to view the ſtrong holds which he himſelf, under the tuition of Nuſerit, had ſome time before taken from the unfortunate Judger Singh.

The emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached a part of the army under Abdalla to ſuppreſs the inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.  Abdalla at the ſame time received a commiſſion to govern Behâr in quality of Suba.

He ſhut himſelf up in a fortreſs which was inveſted on all ſides. When a breach was made in the walls, and the orders for the aſſault were iſſued, the Raja came out of his caſtle, leading his children in his hand. He might have been pardoned; but his wife appearing behind him, ſealed his doom. She was extremely handſome, and Abdalla, though old himſelf, wiſhed to grace his haram with a beautiful widow. The unfortunate Raja, therefore, was put to death on the ſpot as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Candahâr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to the empire.</note>The news of the defeat and death of the Raja of Budgepour had  ſcarce arrived at court, when Shaw Jehân received an agreeable piece of intelligence from the northern frontier of the empire. The feeble adminiſtration of Sefi, who ſucceeded Shaw Abas in the throne of Perſia, had thrown the affairs of that kingdom into confuſion. Ali Murdan commanded in the fortreſs of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahâr. His fidelity was ſuſpected; and, beſides, he ſaw no end of the troubles which diſtracted his country. He reſolved to ſave himſelf from the malice of his enemies, by delivering the city to the emperor of Hindoſtan, from whoſe hands it had been wreſted by Shaw Abas. A negociation was therefore ſet on foot by Ali Murdan with Seid Chan, the governor of Cabul. His terms were only for himſelf. Seid cloſed with him in the name of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. He ſent his ſon in haſte with a force to Candahâr, which

                  <note place="margin">Perſian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</note>Sefi no ſooner heard of the treachery of Ali Murdan, than  he iſſued orders for a force to march from Choraſſan to retake Candahâr. This expedition was under the conduct of Scâhôſh. That officer appeared before the city with ſeven thouſand horſe; but Seid, who commanded in the place, ſallied out with an inferior force, and totally defeated the Perſians, for which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervice he was raiſed, by the name of Ziffer Jung, to the dignity of ſix thouſand horſe. Gulzâr, the governor of Moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, was removed to Candahâr; and as a general war with Perſia was apprehended, the prince Suja was diſpatched with a great army to the province of Cabul. Before Gulzâr arrived at his new government, Seid following his victory over the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, penetrated into Seiſtân. Buſt, Zemindâwir, and other places fell into his hands; and all the diſtrict which had formerly been annexed to the government of Candahâr, was reduced to ſubjection by his arms.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ali Murdan rewarded.</note>The emperor was ſo overjoyed at the recovery of Candahâr,  that he received Ali Murdan with every mark of eſteem and gratitude. He was raiſed to the rank of ſix thouſand horſe, with the title of captain-general of the Imperial forces, and inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the government of Caſhmire. The ſervice he had done was great, but the reward of treachery was extravagant. Ali, however, ſeemed to poſſeſs abilities equal to any rank. Bold, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and ambitious, he graſped at power; and when he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, he kept it during his life by management and intrigue. His generoſity rendered him popular; and before his death he is ſaid to have numbered ſixteen thouſand families of Afgans, Uſbecs, and Moguls among his clients and dependants.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Invaſion from Aſſam.</note>The moſt remarkable tranſaction of the year 1638, next to the recovery of Candahâr, was an invaſion of the province of Bengal by the Tartars of Aſſâm. They ruſhed down the river Birram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puta  in armed boats, to where it falls into the Ganges, below Dacca. They plundered ſome of the northern diſtricts, and made themſelves maſters of ſeveral ſmall forts. Iſlam, governor of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, hearing of the invaſion, marched againſt the enemy with all the Imperial troops ſtationed in the province. They had the folly to come to action with the Suba, and he gave them a ſignal defeat. Four thouſand were killed on the ſpot, and five hundred armed veſſels fell into the hands of the conqueror. The remaining part of the invaders fled; and the governor purſued them into their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Fifteen forts, with the king of Aſſam's ſon-in-law, fell into his hands. The whole province of Cochâgi was reduced; and he invaded that of Buldive. The latter was very obſtinately defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Few paſſes led into it, being environed with mountains. The Suba at laſt forced the paſſes, and the enemy fled to the hills.</p>

Worn out with fatigue, haraſſed with grief, and tormented with vexation, he was ſeized with a contagious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which infected his family, and carried him and them off in a few days. His people, however, would not quit their hills. The enemy ſpread devaſtation over the plain below; and the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Aſſâmites beheld from the woods, the ſmoke of their burning towns. But the unbounded ravages of Iflam occaſioned his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The grain was inadvertently deſtroyed in the fire which conſumed the towns of Buldive, and a ſcarcity of proviſions began to be felt in the Imperial camp. Iſlam marched back with the ſpoils of Aſſâm; but he ſuffered incredible hardſhips from the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the roads, the torrents which fell from the hills, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, which the rainy ſeaſon, now come on, had raiſed in the

He was greatly pleaſed with the ſucceſs of his arms, as none of the Mahommedan princes, who had reigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in India, ever penetrated into thoſe countries.</p>

The Rajaputs, properly ſo called, did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the right of Huſſinet. He had an elder brother, and they adhered to him. The flames of a civil war were kindied; but the emperor interfered; and, after having examined the claims of both the princes, he confirmed the Raja's will in favour of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinet, whom he raiſed to the rank of four thouſand horſe.

It extended as far as Lahore; and in the mountains of Cabul and Caſhmire, many villages, with all their inhabitants, were overwhelmed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The emperor, in the mean time, kept his court at La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hore. Peace being eſtabliſhed on every ſide, he applied himſelf to the management of the civil government of the empire. He iſſued many ſalutary edicts for the ſecurity of property, the improvement of the country, and the encouragement of commerce. In the midſt of his cares for the good of the ſtate, he was afflicted with the death of Afzil Chan, a man of great literary talents, who had been his preceptor. The young princes were alſo educated under his care, and they mourned him as a father. He had been raiſed to the firſt honours of the empire. He obtained the rank of ſeven thouſand, and the management of the civil affairs of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were in a great meaſure in his hands. The emperor, to ſhow his great veneration for his abilities, allowed him an annual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of three hundred and ſeventy-five thouſand pounds.</p>

Dara was dignified with the  title of an Omrah of ten thouſand horſe and ten thouſand foot; and Suja with the rank of ſeven thouſand horſe and as many of foot. The emperor having frequently declared his intentions of leaving the throne to Dara, gave him always the firſt place in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and power. He ſhewed an inclination of habituating his other ſons to a ſubmiſſion to Dara; and whatever marks of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior affection he might beſtow on his younger ſons in private, in public he directed his principal attention to the eldeſt.

Averſe to idleneſs in his command of the army in the Decan, he made an incurſion, under pretence of injuries, into the country of Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana. The forts fell into his hands, and the chiefs ſubmitted to a tribute; but the ſterility and poverty of thoſe regions did neither anſwer the expence of the war, nor that of keeping the poſſeſſion of the conquered country. He therefore evacuated the places which he had taken, and depended for the tribute on the future fears of the enemy. Having brought back the army within the limits of the empire, Aurungzêbe, who was jealous of the influence of Dara with the emperor, requeſted leave of abſence, and came to Lahore, where his father at the time reſided.</p>

His wife dying, he returned on the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>third of June 1638 to Lahore, where he was married with great pomp and ſolemnity to the daughter of Azim.

Shaw Jehân, who was a ſevere juſticiary, would not even have his repreſentatives in the provinces ſuſpected of partiality in the diſtribution of the laws. He heard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the pooreſt ſubjects, from the moſt diſtant corners of the empire, and the influence of the firſt men in the ſtate was not ſuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to protect the delinquents from his reſentment. He was, therefore, beloved by the people, and reverenced and feared by the great. An Imperial order was iſſued to Abdalla to appear in

The banditti who infeſted the country, fled precipitately to their mountains, and diſperſed themſelves to their ſeveral homes. Some examples of juſtice upon thoſe who fell into the hands of the Imperialiſts, confirmed the tranquillity which now was general over all the empire. The attention of the emperor to the improvement of his dominions, his impartial execution of juſtice, his exact but not oppreſſive mode of collecting the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, rendered his people happy and his empire flouriſhing. A lover of pleaſure himſelf, though not fond of parade and ſhew, his haram was a conſiderable market for the fineſt manufactures; and the ample proviſion made for his ſons and nobles, rendered his capital a cluſter of princely courts, where magnificence and elegant luxury prevailed in the extreme. He divided his time between the hall of audience and the haram.

In public deeds he was ſtyled, The Strength of the Realm, the Protector of the Empire, the Powerful Prince, the Lord of Lords, the revered Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Wiſdom, the Leader of Armies, in rank great as ASIPH, and a Lion in War.</p>

                  <note place="margin">He leaves his fortune to prince Dara.</note>Though three ſons and five daughters ſurvived the viſier, he adopted his grandſon Dara, the Imperial prince, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted  him heir to all his fortune. He excuſed himſelf to his ſons, by ſaying, that he had already raiſed them to high ranks and employments in the ſtate; and that, if they conducted themſelves with prudence and wiſdom, the favour of the emperor would be to them an ample fortune. <q rend="inline">"But, ſhould Folly be the ruler of your conduct," continued Aſiph, "you do not deſerve to poſſeſs the wealth which I have acquired by my ſervices."</q> There was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the conduct of Aſiph upon this occaſion. The emperor loved money; and he might have availed himſelf of the law, which conſtitutes the prince the heir of all his officers; and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of that kind might prove fatal to the influence and intereſt of the family of the viſier. He, however, divided, before his death, three hundred and ſeventy-five thouſand pounds among his children and ſervants. Dara, in terms of his will, took poſſeſſion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0828300200:337"/>

He was a great orator, a fine writer, an able politician. In his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate character, he was mild, affable, humane, generous; in his public, ſevere, reſerved, inflexible, exact. He never excuſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence; he puniſhed diſobedience. His orders, therefore, were no ſooner iſſued than they were executed; his very nod was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, underſtood, and obeyed. He was poſſeſſed of political as well as perſonal courage; as little afraid of the unjuſt reproaches of his friends, as he was of the weapons of his enemies; and he was often heard to ſay, <q rend="inline">"That he who fears death is unworthy of life."</q> He was uniform in his conduct, impartial and dignified in his actions, conſiſtent with himſelf. He courted not popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by his meaſures: juſtice, propriety, and the ultimate good of the ſtate, and not the applauſe of the vulgar, were his objects in all his deciſions. He was fit for the field, as well as adapted for the cabinet; and had he not gained renown with the pen, he would have commanded it with the ſword. In his youth, he was addicted to poetry. He wrote upon heroic ſubjects; and the fire of his genius was ſuch, that the very ſound of his verſe animates the ſoul to war. The glory and happineſs of India during his long adminiſtration were great; and when war raged on the frontiers, the interior provinces enjoyed uninterrupted peace. The field in which he moved was extenſive, but his eye comprehended the whole. An eaſtern writer continues the metaphor, and ſays, <q rend="inline">"That he rendered that field flouriſhing and fruitful. He paſſed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0828300200:338"/>
through it with reputation and luſtre, and when he ſunk into the grave, a cloud of ſorrow obſcured the face of the empire."</q>

He poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed not the abilities of his family; being of an infirm and ſickly conſtitution, with a delicate, rather than a vigorous and active mind. Mirza Miſti, the ſecond ſon of Aſiph, was a youth of great hopes; vigorous, active, and full of fire. He loſt his life in a drunken frolic; for being one day at the river Behât in Caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, when it foamed over its banks, he ſpurred his horſe into the ſtream, by way of bravado, and, for his temerity, was drowned. Mirza Huſſein, the third ſon of the viſier, was a man of moderate abilities; and his fourth ſon, who had been digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the title of Shaw Nawâz, was a nobleman of great reputation and high diſtinction in the empire.</p>

The puniſhment of death ſeemed to have been laid aſide from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this regin. Tirbiet Chan was, this year, ordered back from the government of Cabul, for his ſeverity in exacting the revenue from the poor. The emperor himſelf had been a witneſs of the miſerable condition to which the people of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince were reduced, by the floods in the rivers Choſhal and Behât; and they had not yet recovered from that grievous calamity.

HE is the only object of attention; and when he ſits in the midſt of tranquillity, the page of the hiſtorian  languiſhes in the detail of unimportant events. His hall of audience is a court of ſummary juſtice. His deciſions are rapid; and they are generally impartial, as his ſituation has placed him beyond the limits of fear and of favour. But there is a ſameneſs which never plcaſes, in the tranſactions of a government whoſe operations run through one unchangeable channel; and it is for this reaſon only, we paſs lightly over the more peaceable years of the reign of Shaw Jehân. In theſe he acted in the character of a judge, a mere determinator, if the word may be uſed, of

differences between individuals; and it muſt be confeſſed, that he had abilities to ſee, and integrity to do what was right.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Emperor arrives at Agra.</note>Lahore, during the former reign, had been conſidered as the  capital of the empire, and the moſt ſettled reſidence of the prince. Jehangire, whoſe lungs were weak, wiſhed to breathe in the free air of the north; and the improvements which he made in the palace and gardens, had rendered Lahore the moſt convenient and beautiful, if not the moſt magnificent of the Imperial reſidences. Shaw Jehân, however, whoſe attention to the affairs of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was always uppermoſt in his mind, thought Lahore too diſtant from the ſouthern provinces; which, on account of their wealth, were the moſt important diviſion of his dominions. He therefore reſolved, as there was a proſpect of permanent tranquillity on the northern frontier, to remove his court to Agra, where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the month of November. The cavalcade which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his progreſs, was magnificent and numerous beyond deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The armies returned from the north were in his train; and half the citizens of Lahore, who, from his long reſidence in that place, were become in a manner his domeſtics, accompanied him on his march. He pitched his tents in the gardens of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite wife, Mumtâza Zemân. The tomb of that princeſs was now finiſhed at a great expence; and he endowed with lands a monaſtery of Fakiers, whoſe buſineſs it was to take care of the tomb, and to keep up the perpetual lamps over her ſhrine.</p>

emperor's attention to the execution of juſtice was interrupted by his love for women. A ſon was in the mean time born to Dara, the Imperial prince. Shaw Jehân, who loved his ſon, gave a magnificent feſtival upon the occaſion. His poſterity began to multiply apace. A ſon was born to Aurungzêbe, whom he named Mahommed Mauzim; and Morâd had this year a daughter whom he called Zêbe-ul-Niſſa, or, The Ornament of Women. The emperor, in the courſe of the year, made an excurſion to Ajmere; and after he returned to Agra, Dara was ſeized with a violent fever, which endangered his life.</p>

Returning one night from viſiting her father to her own apartments in the haram, ſhe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bruſhed with her clothes one of the lamps which ſtood in the paſſage. Her clothes caught fire; and, as her modeſty, being within hearing of men, would not permit her to call for aſſiſtance, ſhe was ſcorched in a terrible manner. She ruſhed into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram in flames; and there were no hopes of her life. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was much afflicted. He gave no audience for ſeveral days. He diſtributed alms to the poor; he opened the doors of priſons; and he, for once, became devout, to bribe Heaven for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his favourite child. He, however, did not in the mean time neglect the common means. Anit-Alla, the moſt famous phyſician of the age, was brought expreſs from Lahore; and the Sultana, though by ſlow degrees, was reſtored to health.</p>

When he was brought into the emperor's preſence, he was forced, by the lords in waiting, to make the uſual ſubmiſſions, and the emperor pronounced his pardon from the throne; deſiring him at the ſame time to take his place among the lords, in the rank which had been conferred upon him on a former occaſion. He accordingly took his place; but being a young man of a proud and ungovernable ſpirit, he burnt with rage at the late indignity, as well as at the paſt injury done him by the emperor, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him his younger brother. He drew his dagger in ſecret; and ruſhed furiouſly toward the throne. Sillabut Chan, the paymaſter-general of the forces, threw himſelf before Amar, who plunged his dagger in his body, and ſtretched him dead at his feet. Chilulla, Seid Sallâr, and ſeveral other lords drew immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately their ſwords, and ſlew the Hindoo prince on the ſpot. The emperor, who had deſcended from his throne with his ſword in his hand, ordered the body to be dragged out of the hall of audience. A number of his followers, ſeeing their maſter dead, fell upon the guards, and fought till they were cut off to a man.</p>

He was naturally fond of his children: he liked their ſpirit, and loved their aſpiring genius. He was, however, too prudent not to foreſee the diſturbances which were likely to riſe from even their good qualities. His affection, when they were young, prevented him from following the policy of other Deſpots, by ſhutting up every acceſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from their minds: and to keep them at court after they had commanded armies and provinces, would be a perpetual ſource of animofity between them, and of uneaſineſs to himſelf.

Twenty-five thouſand pounds had been annually paid to her out of the treaſury; and, as her power ceaſed with the death of her conſort, ſhe was too proud even to ſpeak of public affairs, and ſhe, therefore, gave up her mind to ſtudy, retirement, and eaſe.

Their power, it is true, is ſometimes exerted in the haram; but, like the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the magnet, it is ſilent and unperceived.

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe, in the mean time, reſtored his ranks, and returned to the charge.

The latter, in his frequent expeditions at the head of armies, found various opportunities of gaining friends, by the places of honour and profit which he had, by his commiſſion, to beſtow; and he was not of a diſpoſition to relinquiſh by negligence, the influence which he had acquired by favours. Cool, ſubtle, and ſelf-denied, he covered his actions with ſuch an appearance of honeſt ſincerity, that men imputed his attention to their own merit, and not to his deſigns. The penetrating eye of his father had pierced the veil which he had thrown over his ambition; but the implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which Aurungzêbe paid to all his commands flattered him into a kind of oblivion of his former obſervations on the duplicity of his character. Dara had carried his jealouſy of Aurungzêbe into a kind of averſion to his perſon. He envied him when ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0828300200:364"/>
and he triumphed over his misfortunes: but his exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was as ſecret as his hatred, as both proceeded from fear, a paſſion which his ſoul diſdained to own.</p>

He applied to his father for an army: inſinuating, that the bad ſucceſs which attended his brother, proceeded from his want of knowledge and conduct. A very large ſum was iſſued from the Imperial treaſury; and the army and artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery in the provinces beyond the Indus were ſubmitted to the command of Dara. That prince inveſted Candahâr. The ſiege continued five months, without any impreſſion being made. The ſtores were at laſt exhauſted, the troops were diſpirited, and Dara found himſelf under the neceſſity of retreating with loſs of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Shaw Jehân was ſilent upon the occaſion; and even Aurungzêbe, who triumphed in ſecret over Dara's diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, attributed, in his converſation, this freſh miſcarriage to the ſtrength of the place, more than to his brother's want of abilities in war.</p>

He foreſaw the tumult and  diſorder which were likely to ariſe from the ambition of his younger ſons after his death; and he reſolved to habituate them, in his lifetime, to the authority of their elder brother. Having ordered all the nobles to attend the preſence; he deſcended from his throne, took Dara by the hand, and placed him under the Imperial conopy; commanding the lord of the requeſts to read aloud an edict, changing the name of Dara into that of Shaw Belind Akbal, or THE EMPEROR OF EXALTED FORTUNE. <q rend="inline">"Behold," ſaid Shaw Jehân, "your future prince!

He was received with the uſual honours, and eſcorted by a party of the Imperial cavalry to court. The preſents which he brought to the emperor were rather curious and rare, than valuable. He was treated with the higheſt diſtinction; a table was kept for him at the public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and he was gratified with a conſiderable preſent in money for his own private uſe. He remained for ſome months in Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan; and Caim Beg, an Omrah of diſtinction, returned with him to Conſtantinople, on the part of the emperor.</p>

The emperor detached thirty thouſand horſe, under Sadulla the viſier, to chaſtiſe him for his inſolence, and to demoliſh the works. The Hindoo prince hung out the flag of deſiance, and the viſier inveſted Chitôr. Parties were at the ſame time, detached on all ſides to lay waſte the open country. The refractory prince had not the ſpirit neceſſary to ſupport his rebellion. He ſent, on the eleventh day, to Sadulla a moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive overture of peace.

                  <note place="margin">Riſe and character of Jumla.</note>The moſt memorable tranſaction of the year was the promotion  of Mahommed Jumla, to the rank of five thouſand horſe. He was recommended to the emperor by the prince Aurungzêbe; and as he is to make a great figure in the ſequel of the hiſtory, there is a propriety in premiſing ſomething concerning his origin and gradual riſe. Jumla was a Perſian, born in Ardiſtan, a village in the neighbourhood of Iſpahan. His parents, though of ſome rank, were extremely poor: he, however, found means to acquire ſome knowledge of letters, which circumſtance procured for him the place of clerk to a diamond merchant, who made frequent journies to Golconda. In that kingdom he quitted his maſter's ſervice, traded on his own account, and acquired a conſiderable fortune, which enabled him to purchaſe a place at the court of Cuttub, ſovereign of Tellingana. In that ſtation he behaved ſo well that he attracted the notice of his prince, who raiſed him to a conſiderable rank in the army. His military promotion opened a field for the abilities of Jumla. He yielded to few in conduct; in courage to none. He roſe by his merit to the head of the forces of Tellingana. He led the army into the Carnatic; and, in a war which continued ſix years, reduced that country to ſubjection. But when he conquered for his ſovereign, he acquired wealth for himſelf. Cuttub wiſhing to ſhare with his general in the ſpoil, diſobliged him; and he attached himſelf to the fortunes of Aurungzêbe, who then commanded for his father in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered provinces of the Decan. The prince, who was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent judge of character, ſaw ſomething extraordinary in Jumla.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0828300200:367"/>
He found him, upon trial, a fit inſtrument for his ambition; and he exerted all his influence at court in his favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Promotions.</note>Soon after the promotion of Jumla, the eldeſt ſon of the prince Suja was ſent by his father from Bengal to pay his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects  to the emperor. Shaw Jehân, naturally fond of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, was ſtruck with the accompliſhments of his grandſon; and raiſed him to the rank of ſeven thouſand horſe. To avoid giving umbrage to Dara, always jealous of diſtinctions beſtowed on his brothers, Cipper Shekô, the ſecond ſon of that prince, was promoted to the ſame rank of nobility. A magnificent feſtival was given on the occaſion; at which the dependants of the two dignified princes aſſiſted. Though jealouſy prevailed in private between the poſterity of Shaw Jehân, in public there was nothing but harmony and affection: Dara who, with the ſtate of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, poſſeſſed alſo a part of the power, treated the ſon of Suja with diſtinction and reſpect. His fears of the ambition of Aurungzêbe abſorbed all his ſuſpicions concerning the deſigns of his other brothers. Suja, who was a man of pleaſure, was not ſo formidable as the hypocritical auſterity of Aurungzêbe; and the open valour of Morâd, without the neceſſary balance of prudence, was not an object of ſerious terror.</p>

His aſſiduity and ability in buſineſs recommended him, in an uncommon degree, to the emperor's affections; and the bier of the miniſter was bathed with the tears of his prince. His parts were rather ſolid than ſhining: induſtry and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable perſeverance made up for the defects of his genius. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience rendered him maſter of the detail of finance; and he was by habit converſant in the inferior intrigues, which are the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0828300200:368"/>
ſprings of actions of moment. His mind was too much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in its powers, to comprehend, at one view, the great line of public affairs; but he could execute with preciſion what he could not plan with judgment. He was fond of military fame, but he was unſucceſsful in the field; though neither deficient in conduct nor diſtitute of courage. Superſtition, which was none of the follies of the age, was the greateſt defect in his character; and his ſanctity was ſaid to be frequently a cloke for diſhonourable deeds.</p>

                  <note place="margin">War in Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda.</note>The influence of Jumla with Aurungzêbe, was the ſource of a  new war in the Decan, though another cauſe was aſſigned, to reconcile the emperor to the meaſure. Cuttub Shaw, ſovereign of Tellingana and of a great part of Golconds, had, upon the deſertion of Jumla, impriſoned the ſon of that lord, and ſeized upon his wealth. Aurungzêbe complained, in repeated letters, of Cuttub to his father; alleging, that he was dilatory in the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his annual tribute to the empire. He therefore applied for leave to bring the refractory prince to reaſon by force. The emperor, jealous of his authority, gave permiſſion for the march of an army into the dominions of Cuttub. Mahommed, the eldeſt ſon of Aurungzêbe, commanded in this expedition; a brave, an obſtinate, and a haughty prince, not to be ſwayed from his purpoſe either by argument or fear.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Mahommed the ſon of Aurungzêbe</note>Mahommed, at the head of twenty thouſand horſe, entered  ſuddenly the dominions of Cuttub; and that prince, expecting nothing leſs than hoſtilities, was totally unprepared for war. He ſent meſſengers to the camp of the Imperialiſts; and paid down the arrears of the tribute. He, at the ſame time, releaſed Amîn, the ſon of Jumla; and endeavoured to ſooth Mahommed with rich preſents. This, however, was not the ſole object of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0828300200:369"/>
of the Imperialiſts. The fortune of Jumla was ſtill in the hands of Cuttub. A juſt reſtitution was demanded; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in vain objected, that the accounts between him and Jumla were not ſettled; and, therefore, that till they were adjuſted, he could form no judgment of the ſum which ought to be paid. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed continued obſtinate, and advanced to the gates of Hydra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad. When things appeared ready to come to extremities, a few cheſts of money and ſome caſkets of jewels were delivered by Cuttub, as the whole wealth of Jumla. Amîn made greater claims in the name of his father; and the prince, offended at the prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Cuttub, ordered him to come out of the city to do him homage, as the grandſon of his emperor and lord.</p>

His mind revolted againſt the very idea of homage; and his rage  overcame his prudence. Mahommed entered Hydrabâd. Death and confuſion filled every ſtreet, and the city was ſubmitted to the ravages of fire and ſword. The ſpoils was great, but the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was immenſe. The avarice of the Imperialiſts was defeated by their fury. The flames moved quicker than depredation; ſo that except ſilver, gold, and jewels, which neither the rage of men nor of fire could deſtroy, nothing of value remained to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>

A number of his troops and many of the citizens fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their ſovereign. Mahommed immediately inveſted Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda. Cuttub, in his diſtreſs, reſolved to try the fortune of the field. He accordingly marched out with ſix thouſand horſe, twelve thouſand foot, and a great rabble of half-armed men, to

give battle to the Imperialiſts. The affair was ſoon decided. Cuttub was defeated; and the enemy entered the city at his heels. The horrors of war were renewed in every form. Mahommed waded through blood; Cuttub threw himſelf at his feet, but he was not to be appeaſed by ſubmiſſion. The unfortunate prince at length produced his beautiful daughter, Rizia, to the victor, and he ſheathed his ſword. He married her in form, and a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent feſtival was held to celebrate the nuptials. Mirth was mixed with ſorrow; and pageants of joy with the ſolemn funerals of the dead.</p>

Aurungzêbe wrote a pompous account of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his ſon to the emperor; and that monarch raiſed him to the rank of eleven thouſand horſe. Shaiſta, the ſon of the late viſier Aſiph, was ſecond in command in the expedition againſt Hydrabâd; and he, as a reward for his ſervices, was dignified with the honours of ſix thouſand horſe. Jumla, who had hitherto remained with Aurungzêbe at Brampour, charged himſelf with the letters of that prince to his father. His ſon Amîn attended him to court; and both were received with diſtinguiſhed marks of kindneſs and eſteem. His knowledge and abilities recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Jumla, in a high degree.

                  <note place="margin">Death and character of Ali Murdan.</note>In the month of November of the year 1656, died Ali Murdan, the nominal captain-general of the Imperial forces, on his return  from Agra to his province of Caſhmire. His defection from his ſovereign, the emperor of Perſia, and his delivering up the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant fortreſs of Candahâr, had highly recommended him to Shae Jehân; and he had abilities to keep the favour which he had once acquired. The deſigns of Shaw Sefi againſt his life, were a ſufficient apology for his revolt from that prince; and the fidelity with which he ſerved his benefactor, is a proof that neceſſity was the ſole cauſe of his treachery. He was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a dignified than a great character; more ſit for the fatigues of the ſield than for the intrigues of the cloſet. He was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant to his prince, a conſtant and unſhaken friend, an active and a gallant officer. A love of money, which did not amount to abſolute avarice, was the greateſt defect of his mind; but, were we to judge from the number of his dependants, he was poſſeſſed of a generous diſpoſition. Being always abſent from court in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0828300200:372"/>
the government of various provinces, he had no opportunity for expending his vaſt income; and he therefore amaſſed great wealth. The emperor became the heir of his fortune, which, in money and jewels, amounted to one million eight hundred and ſeventy-five thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Expedition into Bijapour.</note>Intelligence of the march of Jumla flew before him to the  kingdom of Bijapour. Ali, the viſier of the deceaſed Adil, who had raiſed the ſon of that prince to the throne, had foreſeen the ſtrom which was now gathering over his head. He levied forces; he fortified his diſmantled caſtles and towns. Jumla, in the mean time, advanced to Brampour. Aurungzêbe joined him with his forces; and, with his uſual affected humility, pretended to ſubmit himſelf to the command of his father's viſier. That miniſter, however, was too much attached to the intereſts of the prince to avail himſelf of his modeſty; and though Jumla bore the name of commander in chief, the orders of Aurungzêbe were only iſſued and obeyed. The greateſt harmony ſubſiſted between them; for they reckoned this preſent expedition as a fortunate prelude to their future deſigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Siege of Bider.</note>The rapid march of the Imperialiſts diſconcerted the meaſures  of Ali. He had collected an army, but it was too ſmall and the troops too raw to riſque the fortune of the field. He threw a numerous garriſon into Bider, which is one of the ſtrongeſt places in Hindoſtan. With a body of cavalry he himſelf haraſſed the enemy, leaving the command at Bider to Jân Jiſſi; who had been thirty years governor of that important fortreſs. Aurungzêbe arriving before Bider, reconnoitred it with great attention and care. He foreſaw the difficulty which would attend a ſiege; and he endeavoured, by bribes and large promiſes, to corrupt the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Jiſſi. That old officer rejected his propoſals with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0828300200:373"/>
and diſdain; and the prince, deſpairing of ſucceſs by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, prepared to enſure it by force: he accordingly made his approaches to Bider.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That city taken.</note>On the twenty-ſeventh day of the ſiege, a mine being ſprung, a practicable breach was made in the firſt wall. Aurungzêbe,  wiſhing to make a lodgment within the wall, ordered an aſſault. It happened that one of the principal magazines of the place was under a great baſtion in the ſecond wall, oppoſite to the breach. The beſieged having expended all their granadoes and ammunition in repelling the attack, this magazine was thrown open, that they might ſupply themſelves with more. A rocket by accident fell near the door of the magazine, upon ſome powder that had been ſcattered there in the confuſion. It took fire, and communicating with the magazine, blew up the baſtion, which was covered with people, and deſtroyed the greateſt part of the garriſon, who had been drawn together into that place to oppoſe the enemy. The governor and his three ſons were numbered among the dead. The aſſailants, in the mean time, ſuffered conſiderably from the exploſion. The whole place was expoſed. The Imperialiſts took advantage of the conſternation of the ſurviving part of the enemy. A thick darkneſs, occaſioned by the ſmoke and duſt, covered Bider: Aurungzêbe ruſhed over the ruins; and when light began to appear, he found himſelf in the midſt of the citadel. Though there was no reſiſtance, death ravaged all around him; for even his authority could not appeaſe, for ſome time, the rage of the troops.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Adil Shaw defeated,</note>Ali, who had looked on Bider as impregnable, had depoſited in  that city the greateſt part of his young ſovereign's wealth; and Aurungzêbe acquired an immenſe treaſure as well as an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected reputation, from the capture of the place. The miniſter,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0828300200:374"/>
though ſtruck with the loſs of his ſtrongeſt fortreſs, did not give all his hopes away. He collected a numerous army of Abyſſinian mercenaries under the walls of Kilburga; and placed the prince at their head. Aurungzêbe deſpiſed the enemy too much to march againſt him in perſon. He detached twenty thouſand horſe, under the command of Mohâbet, toward Kilburga; whilſt he himſelf ſat down before Kallian, which, after a ſiege of a few weeks, fell into his hands. Mohâbet, in the mean time, came to battle with Ali, and defeated his mercenary army with great ſlaughter. Aurungzêbe himſelf arrived in the camp ſoon after the battle, and inveſted Kilburga, where the fugitives had taken refuge.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and ſubmits.</note>Kilburga was large and well fortified. The garriſon was nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,  and made frequent ſallies. They at length iſſued forth with their whole force, came to battle, and were driven back into into the city with great ſlaughter. Theſe repeated efforts weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened thoſe within; but one of the generals of young Adil, who commanded a body of horſe, was very active in haraſſing from without, the Imperial army. He cut off their convoys; and a ſcarcity prevailed in their camp. Aurungzêbe, however, was not to be driven from his deſigns. He carried on the ſiege with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abating diligence; and, having made a practicable breach in the walls, he took Kilburga by aſſault on the eleventh of June 1657. Adil, led by his miniſter Ali, threw himſelf at the feet of the conqueror. The tribute of Bijapour was fixed at one million eight hundred and ſeventy-five thouſand pounds; and a great ſum toward defraying the expence of the war, was paid down by Adil. He, at the ſame time, was obliged to give up his ſtrongeſt forts, and to ſettle eſtates upon ſome of the adherents of Aurungzêbe. That prince having changed the name of the city of Bider to that

After the taking of Bider, the name of Aurungzêbe appeared firſt in the commiſſion for commanding the army. The attachment and gratitude of Jumla to that prince, induced him to requeſt the emperor to confer upon him the honour as well as the power in the expedition. The meaſure beſides was favourable to their concerted plans of ambition. Shaw Jehân was now become aged; and his exceſſes in venery had weakened his conſtitution. The ſcene of ambition was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and Aurungzêbe, who had opened his whole ſoul to Jumla, had concerted all his future meaſures with that lord. Orders, in the mean time, arrived, for the viſier to return to court.

He remained in a ſtate of inſenſibility for ſeveral days, and all hopes of his recovery va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But by the copious bleeding preſcribed by his phyſicians, he was at length relieved. His diſorder, however, returned, though not with the ſame violence; and, on the occaſion, the cuſtomary edict for the remiſſion of the taxes due for the year, when the life of the emperor is in danger, was iſſued, with the uſual formalities. Large ſums were, at the ſame time, given to the poor, and to Fakiers of reputed ſanctity, for their prayers to Heaven for the recovery of Shaw Jehân. The moſques were filled with the devout; and the people in general expreſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned

grief at the danger of a monarch, under whoſe auſpicious reign they had enjoyed protection and happineſs. All buſineſs was ſuſpended in Delhi. Silence prevailed over the whole place; except when that ſilence was broken by anxious enquiries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the emperor's health. Shaw Jehân was a ſtranger to the intereſt which he poſſeſſed in the hearts of his ſubjects, till he fell into a diſeaſe which was thought mortal by all.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Dara aſſumes the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The emperor being by his diſorder rendered incapable of giving any attention to buſineſs, the management of public affairs fell  into the hands of Dara. His father had prepared for an accident which might occaſion a ſuſpenſion of government. An edict had ſome time before been iſſued, bearing that the ſignet of Dara ſhould be conſidered as equally valid with that of the emperor, through all the dominions of the houſe of Timur. The prince, however, till Shaw Jehân fell ill, made no uſe of this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power. When his father became inſenſible, Dara mounted the throne. Warm, vehement, and precipitate, he acted the ſovereign with too much violence. He iſſued out a public order, that no perſon whatever ſhould preſume, under pain of death, to hold any correſpondence with his brothers, upon the preſent poſture of affairs. The agents of Aurungzêbe and Morâd at court, were ſeized, with their papers, and impriſoned. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in their hands, on account of the princes, was locked up; and, in ſhort, the whole conduct of Dara betrayed the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſuſpicions of the deſigns of his brothers.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His violence.</note>The ſuſpenſion of the viſier was among Dara's firſt acts of  power. He ſuſpected his ſidelity, as being raiſed to his office by the influence of Aurungzêbe. An Indian prince, by the title of Rai Raiân, was made temporary viſier; for the commiſſions given by Dara were limited expreſsly to the time of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's

illneſs. The prince, in the mean time, ordered all the nobles into the hall of preſence. He explained to them, with unfeigned tears, the hopeleſs condition of the emperor. He hinted the ambition of his brothers; and the dangers which would ariſe to the empire from a civil war. <q rend="inline">"The emperor," ſaid he, "more from an idea of juſtice, than from any ſuperior affection to me, has appointed me his ſucceſſor in the throne; and I find, in my own mind, no inclination to relinquiſh what Heaven and my father have thrown into my hands. Thoſe, therefore, who will ſhow the earlieſt zeal in my ſupport, ſhall command my gratitude. Be explicit and open, as I always am; and reſolve to continue faithful. Such of you as owe favours to my brothers, will not ſerve me with zeal. Let them, therefore, in their prudence, retire to their houſes. I want not their pretended ſupport; and I will not bear with their intrigues in favour of others."</q> The wiſhes of the prince were commands.

Several arrangements were made in the greater offices, during this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Chilulla was ſent back to the government of Delhi; and Daniſmund was turned out of his office of paymaſter-general of the Imperial forces.

On the 16th of November 1657, he arrived at a palace in the  country near Agra, and he continued daily to mend, till the 7th of February 1658, on which day he entered Agra in perfect health. The populace, who had exhibited their affection in ſilent ſorrow during his illneſs, crowded round him with tumultuous joy. His heart was opened at the ſhouts of his people; and he ordered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſums to be diſtributed among the poorer fort.

But if Dara's ſilial piety was great, the emperor's gratitude was not leſs. He exhibited to his ſon unbounded teſtimonies of his affection and regard.

                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of the civil wars.</note>SHAW Jehân, after a reign of thirty years of proſperity, found himſelf ſuddenly involved in trouble and misfortune. The ſtorm had been long gathering: it was foreſeen, but nothing  could prevent it from falling. The emperor, with abilities for buſineſs, was addicted to pleaſure; and, though he was deciſive in the preſent moment, he was improvident of the future. His affection for his ſons was the ſource of the calamities which ſhook his empire. Pleaſed with their promiſing parts when young, he furniſhed them with opportunities for exerting their talents in the cabinet, as well as in the field; and when they became, by their own merit, objects of public attention, it was dangerous, if not impracticable, to reduce them into private ſtations. The unſettled ſyſtem of ſucceſſion to the crown, had rouzed their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and awakened their fears. They were to each other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of terror, as well as of envy. They all looked forward with anxiety to the death of their father; and each ſaw in that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0828300200:381"/>
gloomy point, either a throne or a grave. Their hopes and fears increaſed with their growing age. They had provided themſelves againſt the important event of his demiſe; and when he was ſeized with what was deemed a mortal diſeaſe, they broke forth at once from that ſilent reſpect, which their reverence for the perſon and authority of a parent had hitherto impoſed on their minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Views of the emperor's ſons.</note>The means of ambition, which their reſpective ranks in the empire had placed in the hands of each of the ſons of Shaw  Jehân, were great; but their boldneſs to carry their ſchemes into execution was greater ſtill. High-ſpirited and intrepid, they wiſhed for no object which their natural courage durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to obtain: they were born for enterprize, and though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure ambitious, they loved danger more than power. Each was poſſeſſed of armies and of treaſures: and, being rivals in fame as well as in influence, they loſt all affection for one another, in the more violent paſſions of the mind. Dara, veſted with his claim of primogeniture, as well as with his father's declaration in favour of his ſucceſſion, conſtrued the ambition of his brothers into rebellion. Suja, in poſſeſſion of Bengal, was carried by his pride to the reſolution of ſeizing the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Aurungzêbe covered his ambition with motives of religion; and the vehement Moràd arrogated all to himſelf by his courage. The figure which the brothers are to make in the ſucceeding ſccnes, ſeems to demand a delincation of their reſpective charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Character of Dara.</note>Dara, the eldeſt ſon of Shaw Jehân, was polite in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, affable, open and free. He was eaſy of acceſs, acute in  obſervation, learned, witty and graceful in all his actions. He pryed not into the ſecrets of others; and he had no ſecret him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0828300200:382"/>
but what he diſdained to hide. He came fairly upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; he concealed nothing from them, and he expected that faith which he freely gave. Active, lively, and full of fire, he was perſonally brave; and he forgot misfortune in the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of his mind; which, neglecting paſt evils, looked forward to future good. Though elevated with ſucceſs, he never was dejected by bad fortune; and though no believer in a particular providence, he met with all the incidents of life as if they had been immoveably determined by Fate. In his public character, he was ſometimes moroſe, frequently haughty, always obſtinate, and full of pride. Self-ſufficient in his opinions, he ſcarce could hear advice with patience; and all he required of his friends was implicit obedience to his commands. But, with this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ill-nature, he was in his diſpoſition humane and kind; for though he was often paſſionate, his rage was not deſtructive; and it paſſed ſuddenly away without leaving a trace of malice behind. In his private character Dara was, in every reſpect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable. He was an indulgent parent, a faithful huſband, a dutiful ſon. When he returned at night to his family, the darkneſs which had covered his brow, throughout the day, was diſpelled; his countenance was lightened up with joy, and his whole converſation diſplayed a peculiar ſerenity and benevolence of diſpoſition. Though no enemy, from principle, to pleaſure, he was naturally virtuous; and he filled up his leiſure time with ſtudy, inſtead of thoſe enervating indulgences, which render the princes of the Eaſt effeminate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Suja.</note>Suja was humane in his diſpoſition, averſe to cruelty, an enemy  to oppreſſion. In the execution of juſtice, he had no reſpect of perſons but when the natural tenderneſs of his diſpoſition gave his mind a bias toward the unfortunate. Though honeſt, like his brother Dara, he was not ſo open and free. He never told a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0828300200:383"/>
falſehood; but he did not always tell the whole of the truth. He was more tranquil, more cloſe and reſerved than Dara; and he was more fitted for the intrigues of party, and that management which is neceſſary to direct the various paſſions of men to one point. He was generous to his friends; he did not diſdain to hear their advice, though he for the moſt part followed his own judgment of things. He was fond of pomp and magnificence; and much addicted to the pleaſures of the haram. Graceful and active in his own perſon, he loved in women that complete ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of limbs which rendered himſelf the favourite of the ſex; and he ſpared no expence in filling his ſeraglio with ladies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their beauty and accompliſhments. In their ſociety he ſpent too much of his time; but the warmth of his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not make him neglect the neceſſary affairs of life. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his long government of Bengal, he won the affections of the people by the ſoftneſs of his manners, and his exact and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous execution of juſtice; and the country flouriſhed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and agriculture, under the protection which he invariably gave to induſtry. In battle he was brave; nor was he deſtitute of the talents neceſſary for a general; and we much attribute his misfortunes in the field to the effeminacy of his troops, more than to his own want of conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe.</note>The character of Aurungzêbe differed in every reſpect from thoſe of his elder brothers. Deſtitute of that graceful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance  of perſon which rendered them popular as ſoon as ſeen, he acquired by addreſs that influence over mankind, which nature had on them beſtowed. In diſpoſition ſerious and melancholy, he eſtabliſhed an opinion of the ſolidity of his underſtanding, even among thoſe who had no opportunity of being acquainted with his great talents. Pliant and accommodating in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he gained mankind by flattering their pride; and he wrapt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0828300200:384"/>
up his behaviour in ſuch plauſibility, that they attributed his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to their own merit, more than to his deſigns. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon converſation turned always on trifles. In affairs of moment he was reſerved, crafty, and full of diſſimulation. Religion, the great engine of political impoſtors, he profeſſed in all its ſeverity. With it he deceived the weak, and awed into a kind of reverence for his perſon, the greateſt enemies of his power. Though not remarkable for humanity, he did not naturally delight in blood; but ambition was his darling paſſion, and before it vaniſhed all the ſofter feelings of the ſoul. Fear, which renders other tyrants cruel, had no place in his breaſt; but that provident caution, which wiſhes to ſhut up every acceſs to danger, made him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about the lives of his rivals. He had a particular talent for kindling diſſentions among thoſe who oppoſed his deſigns; and his art and cunning were more deſtructive to his enemies than his ſword.</p>

In rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in bending the bow, in throwing the lance, he met with few that could equal him in the armies which he commanded; and he was more deſirous of carrying the palm in the manly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the field, than in the intrigues of the cabinet. He deſpiſed all cabals: he gloried in keeping nothing ſecret. He thought it beneath his dignity to command mankind by art; and he openly profeſſed, that he diſdained to owe diſtinction to any thing but the ſword. <q rend="inline">"To poſſeſs a throne by the will of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to owe it to birth," ſaid Morâd, "is unworthy of a great prince; and had not my brother ſupported his pretenſions to the crown by arms, I would diſdain to wear it."</q> In battle his ſoul

But his very virtues were weakneſs; and his fate furniſhes a melancholy proof, that an open generoſity of ſpirit is never a match for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy and deceit. His ſplendid qualities, however, rendered him popular in the army; and Aurungzêbe, notwithſtanding his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of parts, owed, at laſt, his ſucceſs over Morâd, as much, atleaſt, to accident as to his known talents.

The emperor became more and more perplexed, as matters approached to a deciſion. He knew that the nobles loved not Dara: he knew that the beſt troops were abſent with Solimân. One expedient only remained, and that, if followed, would have inſured ſucceſs. He ordered the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial tent to be pitched without the walls; declaring, that he would take the field in perſon againſt the rebels. His frineds ſaw an end to his troubles in this reſolution. His own army to a man would die in defence of his power; and even the troops of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe and Morâd had openly declared, that they would not draw their ſwords againſt Shaw Jehân. The infatuation of Dara pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his father's deſigns. He had recourſe to intreaty, and when that failed, to commands. The emperor, whoſe intellects had been in ſome meaſure impaired by his illneſs, was, at firſt, ſhocked at the obſtinacy of Dara. That prince, whoſe ſilial piety was even greater than his ambition, waited upon his father. He threw himſelf at his feet, and earneſtly requeſted that he would not endanger his health by taking the field; as, upon his life, the proſperity of the empire depended, in days of ſo much trouble.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Charge given him by his father.</note>The emperor, having yielded to the intreaties of Dara, conjured him, though bent on war, to avoid coming to action till the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of his ſon. The malignity of his fate prevailed alſo over this  advice. He ſaid not a word to his father; but his countenance expreſſed chagrin and diſcontent. <q rend="inline">"Then go, my ſon," ſaid Shaw Jehân, "but return not without victory to me. Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſeems to darken the latter days of your father; add not to his grief by preſenting yourſelf before him in your diſtreſs, leſt he may be induced to ſay, That prudence, as well as fortune, were wanting to Dara."</q> The prince had ſcarce parted with his father, when news arrived of the march of the rebels from the city of Ugein. Dara placed himſelf immediately at the head of the army, which conſiſted of one hundred thouſand horſe, with a thouſand pieces of cannon. He advanced haſtily to the banks of the river Chunbul, which is twenty miles from Agra. A ridge of mountains, which extend themſelves to Guzerat, advance into the plain country, along the Chunbul, to within twenty-five miles of the river Jumna; and this paſs Dara occupied with ſtrong lines, ſtrengthened by redoubts, which were mounted with artillery.</p>

Aurungzêbe reconnoitred the ſituation of the enemy, but he was not to be forced. His army conſiſted not of forty thouſand men; and they were fatigued with the heat of the weather and the length of their march. But there was no time to be loſt. Solimân, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with laurels, was approaching faſt with the flower of the Imperial army, to ſupport his father's cauſe. No hopes preſented themſelves to Aurungzêbe; and he became, of a ſudden, ſullen, melancholy, and perplexed. To retreat was ruin: to advance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. He was loſt in ſuſpence. Morâd, with his uſual love
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0828300200:398"/>
of arduous undertakings, was for forcing the lines; but a letter from Shaiſta, the ſon of Aſiph Jâh, and who was third in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Imperial army, broke off that meaſure, by preſenting a better to the brothers. This treacherous lord informed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe, that to attempt the lines would be folly, and that the only means left him was to leave his camp ſtanding to amuſe Dara, and to march through the hills by a bye-road, which two chiefs, who were directed to attend him in the evening, would point out. The princes cloſed with the propoſal. The guides joined them in the evening, and they decamped with the greateſt ſilence, leaving their tents, baggage, and artillery under a ſtrong guard, who were to amuſe the enemy. The army moved about thirty miles that night; and the next day they were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the ſcouts of Dara, in full march toward Agra.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Dara's order of battle, June 5.</note>Dara decamped from his lines with precipitation, leaving the  greater part of his cannon behind him. By a forced march he puſhed between the enemy and the capital; and on the fourth of June he preſented himſelf before the rebels. On the morning of the fifth, the prince ordered the army to be formed in order of battle. Ruſtum Chan, an experienced general from Tartary, marſhalled the field. The artillery was placed in the front, joined together with chains to prevent the paſſage of the cavalry of the enemy. Behind the artillery ſtood a number of camels, mounted with ſmall ſwivels, which the riders of each camel, without lighting, could charge and diſcharge with eaſe. In the rear were drawn up the muſqueteers in three lines; and the two wings were formed of the cavalry, armed with bows and arrows together with ſabres. One third of the cavalry formed the reſerve behind the lines. Dara placed himſelf in the center, mounted on a lofty elephant, from which he could command a view of the field. The treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Shaiſta took the command of the right wing; and that of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0828300200:399"/>
left was deſtined by Dara for Ruſtum. That officer, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged the moſt experienced commander in Hindoſtan, was actually at the head of the army. He bore the commiſſion of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-general, and all orders were iſſued by him. He repreſented to Dara, before the action commenced, that he intended to place himſelf at the head of the reſerve in the rear, where he might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the movements of the field, and iſſue out his orders as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of affairs might require. <q rend="inline">"My poſt," ſaid Dara, "is in the front of battle; and I expect that all my friends ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of my danger, if they wiſh to ſhare the glory which I hope to obtain."</q> The generous and intrepid ſpirit of Ruſtum was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this reflection. He anſwered with a ſtern countenance and a determined tone of voice, <q rend="inline">"The front of battle has been always my poſt, though I never contended for an empire; and if I wiſhed to change it to-day, it was from an anxiety for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Dara."</q> The prince was ſtruck with the impropriety of his own conduct. He endeavoured to perſuade Ruſtum to remain at the head of the reſerve; but he went beyond hearing, and placed himſelf in the front of the left wing.</p>

He committed the left wing to his ſon Mahommed, and he placed himſelf on the right. Morâd was aſtoniſhed, and pleaſed at the eaſe with which Aurungzêbe aſſigned to him the poſt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. But the crafty prince had two reaſons for his conduct. Morâd was haughty, he had aſſumed the Imperial titles, and though, out of a pretended complaiſance to his father, he had laid them down, he looked forward with undeviating ardour to the throne. It was not the buſineſs of Aurungzêbe to offend him at this critical juncture. But his other reaſon was equally prudent. Ruſtum commanded the left wing of the enemy; and he was the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0828300200:400"/>
moſt renowned general of the times. He had paſſed many years in the ſervice of the Tartars and Perſians, being bred up to the the field from his youth, in which he had always eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf. He had been preſent in one hundred general actions; he was habituated to danger, and perfect maſter of his own mind in the moſt deſperate ſituations. Aurungzêbe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not truſt the experience of Ruſtum, againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of any but his own.</p>

Ruſtum advanced, on the left, with a haſty pace, directing the march of his troops by the motion of his ſword. Aurungzêbe ordered a part of his artillery to point toward Ruſtum; and that general received a cannon-ball in his breaſt, when he had advanced within five yards of the enemy. The whole wing ſtopt at the fall of Ruſtum: but Sitterſal, one of the chiefs of the Rajaputs, at the head of five thouſand horſe, fell in, ſword in hand, with Aurungzêbe. Shaw Mahommed, who commanded under the prince, oppoſed the Rajaputs with great bravery. A ſharp conflict enſued; and the Rajaputs began to file off, when their leader engaged perſonally with Shaw Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The Rajaputs ſtrove to cover their chief, but in vain; he was cut down by the ſabre of Mahommed. The whole wing fell into diſorder, but did not fly; and a promiſcuous ſlaughter cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the field with dead.</p>

He was obſerved by his army to look over all the line,  and they gathered courage from his intrepid demeanor. A part of the enemy's artillery was oppoſed to the very point where Dara advanced.

He however ſtood up on his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and, without any change in his countenance, called out with a loud voice to advance with ſpeed. He himſelf, in the mean time, fell in with the firſt line or Morâd.

                  <note place="margin">Morâd's bravery.</note>The whole center under Morâd was broken, and the prince  himſelf was covered with wounds. He endeavoured to lead his troops again to the charge; but they were deaf to his commands. He ordered his elephant to be driven among the thickeſt of the enemy; being determined to fall with his fortune, or, by a brave example, to re-animate his flying troops with hopes of recovering the day. His boldneſs was attended with ſucceſs. His ſquadron ſeeing the enemy ſurrounding their prince, were aſhamed of their terror, and poured around him. Arib Daſs, an Indian chief, thrice ſtrove to reach Morâd with his ſword; but he did not ſucceed, on account of the height of the elephant. He, however, cut the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which ſupported the roof of the Amari or caſtle, which falling upon the prince, incumbered him in ſuch a manner, that he could not defend himſelf. He however diſengaged himſelf, and dealt death with his arrows on every ſide. In the mean time Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the ſon of Aurungzêbe, was ſent by his father's orders from the left to the aſſiſtance of Morâd.

behind, followed him with great ardour. Dara did not retreat. He gave his orders with apparent compoſure. But a cannon-ball having taken off the head of his foſter-brother, who ſat with him on the elephant, he was almoſt blinded with the blood. A rocket, at the ſame time, paſſing by his ear, ſinged his turban; a ſecond followed, and having ſtuck in the front of the Amari, burſt, and broke it all to pieces. His colour was ſeen then to change. The lord who drove the elephant obſerved an alteration in the prince; and, whether through perſonal fear, or for the ſafety of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is uncertain, retreated a few paces. Dara reprimanded him with ſeverity; but the miſchief was already done. His ſquadrons ſaw the retreat of the prince; and their ſpirit flagged. He how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ordered the driver to turn his elephant toward the enemy, but that lord repreſented to him, that now, being marked out by the rebels, it were better for him to mount his horſe, and purſue the fugitives, for that now very few remained on the field. He alighted; but there was no horſe to be found. He fought for ſome time on foot. At length he mounted a horſe whoſe rider had been killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">is defeated.</note>Almoſt the whole of both armies had now left the field. Not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand  men remained with Dara, and ſcarce one hundred horſe with Aurungzêbe and Morâd. The latter however ſought with increaſing ardour. His young ſon, of about eight years of age, ſat with him upon the elephant. Him he covered with his ſhield, and dealt his arrows around on the enemy. Aurungzêbe, having in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to rally his flying ſquadrons, advanced with fifty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the aſſiſtance of Morâd, hoping more for an honourable death than for a victory. It was at the very inſtant that he came to blows with the Imperialiſts, that the unfortunate Dara diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his elephant. The ſquadrons who had ſtill adhered to that prince, ſeeing the elephant retreating with the Imperial ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0828300200:403"/>
thought that Dara had been killed. The cauſe for which they fought, in their opinion, no longer exiſted. They betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to flight; and when Dara had mounted his horſe, he found the field bare of all his troops. He fled with precipitation, and the rebel princes found themſelves at the head of only two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſemen, in poſſeſſion of an unexpected victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note>This battle, in which many thouſands were ſlain on both ſides,  was loſt to Dara by an accident; though that prince was guilty of previous follies, which made men forbode no good to his arms. Had he ſat on his elephant a few minutes longer, the princes his brothers would have been involved in thoſe irretrievable misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which now ſurrounded him. But his evil ſtars prevailed. He who never received counſel before, was ruined by hearkening to advice; and Aurungzêbe, who had placed his hopes on art and intrigue, owed, at laſt, his ſucceſs to his valour. Dara, like a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate gambler, threw all upon throw; and when Fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him in that, he turned the dye for his foes. Had he permitted Shaw Jehân to have taken the field, his brothers would ſcarce have dared to negociate for their lives; had he waited for his gallant ſon, it would not have been a conteſt but a flight. But ambition had dazzled the eyes of Dara, and he could not ſee things in their proper light. Had the emperor appeared at the head of his forces, his power would be at an end. Had So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limân arrived freſh from the conqueſt of Suja, the glory of victory would have reſted upon that prince.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note>THE deciſive battle, which quaſhed for ever the hopes of Dara, and gave the crown of Hindoſtan to Aurungzêbe, was fought within ſixteen miles of Agra. The victor, aſtoniſhed  at a piece of good fortune which he did not expect, purſued not his enemies beyond the field. The fugitives on both ſides had rallied, in the rear of the ſmall parties who continued the action, and preſented a ſhew of firmneſs, without any inclination of renewing the combat. To an unconcerned ſpectator it would have been difficult to determine which party had prevailed. The flight on each ſide was equal; and the field was left, by both armies, to the dead. But Dara was conquered in his own mind; he paſſed ſuddenly through the half-formed lines of his rallied army, and men, who wanted but an excuſe for flight, relinquiſhed their ground with precipitation. Aurungzêbe was firſt convinced
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0828300200:405"/>
of his victory by its conſequences; but whether from policy or fear is uncertain, he forbore to advance towards Agra. He gave time to his troops to recover from their terror; as well as room to his enemies to increaſe their panic: beſides, the affairs of his rival were not deſperate. Should the emperor take the field in perſon, the rebel princes, notwithſtanding the advantages which they had obtained, would have vaniſhed from his preſence. But his diſtemper had not left Shaw Jehân, and he was incumbered with the indolence of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Dara appears before his father.</note>The emperor had ſat all day, in anxious expectation, in the  tower over that gate of the citadel which looked toward the field of battle. Parties of fugitives had often alarmed his fears; but the expreſſes from Dara, during the time of action, had as often reſtored his hopes. The prince at length came to the foot of the wall, with marks of his own defeat. To mention the reſult of the battle was ſuperfluous; his appearance betrayed mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. <q rend="inline">"The rebels, I perceive, have prevailed," ſaid Shaw Jehân with a ſigh; "but Dara Shekô muſt have had ſome other cauſe than fear for his flight."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes," replied the prince, "there is a cauſe. The traitor Shaiſta Chan! I have loſt the empire, but let him not eſcape unpuniſhed."</q> The emperor bent his eyes to the ground, and for ſome time uttered not one word; at length ſuddenly ſtarting up, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What means Dara to do?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"To defend theſe walls,"</q> replied the prince. <q rend="inline">"You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive yourſelf," ſaid Shaw Jehân; "walls are no defence to thoſe who have failed in the field."</q> Having expreſſed himſelf in theſe words, he ordered the byeſtanders to remove. He then adviſed Dara to ſet out immediately for Delhi. He told him, That the governor of that city ſhould have orders to ſupply him with all the public money in his poſſeſſion; and that an expreſs ſhould be immediately diſpatched to his ſon Solimân, to march along the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0828300200:406"/>
northern banks of the Ganges, and to join him in the province of Doâb, which lies between that river and the Jumna.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Flies</note>Dara, approving of this advice, retired to his own palace, and  made preparations for his immediate flight. He loaded all his elephants and chariots with his women and ſlaves; and for want of beaſts of burden, he imprudently left his treaſure behind. About midnight, the unfortunate prince iſſued out of Agra, mounted on horſeback, accompanied by a few menial ſervants. One of the pikemen who attended him, had the inſolence to ride cloſe by his ſide, and to murmur in his ears concerning the loſs which he himſelf ſuſtained by ſuch an abrupt departure. Dara was enraged at this ſudden mark of his own fallen condition. <q rend="inline">"Slave!" ſaid he, "murmur not at your fate. Behold me, who but yeſterday commanded armies, reduced thus low, and forget your own trivial misfortunes. Behold me, who am called great as Darius," alluding to his own name, "obliged to fly by night, and be ſilent concerning your fate."</q> The pikeman was ſtruck by the reproof. He ſhrunk back, and the other ſervants wept. One of them was ſo much enraged that he prepared to chaſtiſe the ſlave; but Dara interpoſing ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Forbear! the friends of the unfortunate have a right to complain in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence."</q>

When he had rode two miles from Agra, he heard the noiſe of horſemen approaching from behind. He ſtood and drew his ſword; but they were two private ſoldiers, who, having perceived the prince paſſing through the gate of the city, took a reſolution to join him. They told their buſineſs; and Dara was prevented from thanking them by his tears. He had not advanced many
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0828300200:407"/>
miles, when an officer, with forty troopers joined him; and by the dawn of the morning, ſeveral men of diſtinction came up with him, with three hundred horſe. With this retinue he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his rout to Delhi; and arrived in that city on the third day after his departure from Agra.</p>

He underſtood that, in the confuſion, he had  neglected to carry along with him his treaſure. He immediately ordered fifty-ſeven mules to be loaded with gold coin, and to be ſent to his ſon under the protection of a detachment of the guards. But a tribe of Hindoos, who have ſince made a figure under the name of Jates, having intelligence of this treaſure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the party, and ſeized the money. This was a dreadful blow to Dara. Thirty lacks of the public money were only found in the poſſeſſion of the governor of Delhi; and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and bankers would ſubſcribe to no loan, in the preſent untoward poſture of the prince's affairs. The threats of military execution at laſt enabled him to raiſe conſiderable ſums, for which he gave orders on the Imperial treaſury. Soldiers flocked round his ſtandard; and he had, in a few days, the appearance of an army.</p>

He ſent letters to the Raja Joy Singh, he wrote to Debere Chan, who were next in command to Solimân Shekô. He exaggerated, if poſſible, the

His friends adviſed him not to obey; but his confidence was equal to his want of faith. He truſted in his own power; he was encouraged by the vicinity of the victorious princes. He went, and ſtood undaunted in the preſence. The emperor, offended before at his treachery, was enraged at his impudence. <q rend="inline">"You villain," ſaid he, "you ſon of a villain, how could you preſume to betray my ſon and me?"</q> Shaiſta took ſire at the reproach. <q rend="inline">"The name," he replied, "I confeſs, is not inſuitable to Aſiph Jâh; he inveſted Shaw Jehân with power, by delivering the heir of the crown into his hands."</q> The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſtarted from his throne, and drew his ſword. He looked furiouſly around on the nobles, and cried, <q rend="inline">"Will none of you ſeize the traitor?"</q> All were ſilent; the emperor repeated the ſame words. Fowlâd Chan ſtept forth, threw Shaiſta to the ground, and binding his hands behind him, aſked the further pleaſure of Shaw Jehân. <q rend="inline">"Throw him headlong," ſaid he, "from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial baſtion."</q> When they were dragging him to execution, Shaiſta cried out to the emperor, <q rend="inline">"Shall you, who are the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent of God, break his laws, by ſhedding blood on the ſeventh day of the holy month of Ramzân?"</q> Shaw Jehân hung down his head for a moment; and then ordered him to be kept bound till the next day.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reſcued.</note>The friends of Shaiſta were, in the mean time, appriſed of his danger. They gathered from all quarters, and collected near ten  thouſand men, who came to the gate of the citadel, and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily demanded him from the emperor. Shaw Jehân continued obſtinate during the night. In the morning, the force of the rebels had increaſed; and he perceived that they were reſolved to come to extremities. He ſent for the priſoner; and obliged him
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0828300200:410"/>
to write an order for them to diſperſe. They ſaw through this piece of policy. They refuſed to obey the commands of a man ſubject to another's power. Scaling ladders were actually applied to the walls; and the emperor was obliged to comply with the demands of the inſurgents, and to reſtore Shaiſta to his freedom.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The princes appear before Agra.</note>On the ninth of June, the confederate princes appeared with  their army before the capital. The city was in no condition to ſuſtain a ſiege; and the gates were left open. Aurungzêbe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to enter Agra, pitched his tent in a garden without the walls. His ſchemes were not yet ripe for execution; and he aſſumed an appearance of moderation. Morâd lay ill of his wounds; and, being unable to attend to buſineſs, a fair field was left for his brother. The emperor, when the van of the rebels appeared in ſight, ordered the gates of the citadel, which was a place of great ſtrength, to be ſhut. This reſolution alarmed Aurungzêbe. To attack his father would be a meaſure of great imprudence. His health being re-eſtabliſhed, his ſubjects ſtill looked up to him as their only lawful ſovereign. Aurungzêbe, therefore, reſolved to ſubſtitute art in the place of force.</p>

He ordered him to touch the ground in his name, before the emperor; and to ſignify to him, that Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe ſtill retained for him the affection of a ſon, and the loyalty of a ſubject; that his grief for what had happened was exceedingly great; that he lamented the ambition and evil deſigns of Dara, who had forced him to extremities; that he rejoiced extremely at the emperor's recovery from his indiſpoſition; and that he himſelf remained without the city, in humble expectation of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Shaw Jehân being no ſtranger to the dark, crafty, and intriguing diſpoſition of Aurungzêbe, received his meſſenger with

                  <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</note>Shaw Jehân, to expiſcate the real deſigns of his rebellious ſons, ſent his eldeſt daughter Jehanâra to viſit them, upon their arrival at  the gates of Agra. Aurungzêbe having owned the ſuperiority of Morâd, the princeſs went firſt to his tent. Morâd was of a diſpoſition that could neither conceal his hatred nor his love. He knew that Jehanâra was inviolably attached to the intereſts of his elder brother; and being at the ſame time fretful through the pain of his wounds, he treated her with diſreſpect, and even uſed harſh expreſſions. The haughty ſpirit of Jehanâra was impatient of inſult. She called for her chair in her rage, and told him, that his brutality was equal to his crimes. The behaviour of Morâd to his ſiſter was inſtantly carried to Aurungzêbe, by his ſpies. He ran out of his tent, and ſtopt her chair. <q rend="inline">"Will my ſiſter," he ſaid, "leave the camp without enquiring concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my health? My long abſence, Jehanâra, has, I fear, blotted me out of the memory of my relations. Should you not deign yourſelf to honour me with your preſence, it would have been kind to have ſent to me one of your meaneſt ſlaves, to give me ſome accounts of my father."</q> Having flattered her pride with ſuch expreſſions as theſe, he prevailed upon her to enter his tent, where ſhe was treated with the higheſt reſpect and diſtinction.</p>

He told her, that his happineſs  in life depended upon his father's forgiveneſs of his errors. <q rend="inline">"But why did I call them errors, Jehanâra?" ſaid he, "they are crimes; though I might plead as an excuſe, that I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

He is moſt offended at Morâd, who has added the name of Sovereign to his other crimes. He conſiders Aurungzêbe as only miſled by miſrepreſentation; Morâd as an obſtinate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined rebel.

But an affected  darkneſs returned upon his features when ſhe mentioned Morâd. <q rend="inline">"Dara's party," he then began, "is ruined; and Fortune has added to the friends of Morâd. The firſt is unpopular, on account of his paſſionate ſeverity among the nobility; the latter beloved, for the open honeſty of his diſpoſition and his unequalled valour. As for me," continued Aurungzêbe, "I am what I ſeem, a man devoted to the ſervice of God; a character little calculated to gain the favour of men. But ſhould Dara appear to have friends to ſupport my endeavours to regain the eſteem of my father, I venture to aſſure Jehanâra, that I will ſucceed or periſh in the attempt."</q> He ſpoke theſe words with ſuch an appearance of emphatic ſincerity, that the princeſs was overjoyed. In the openneſs of her heart, ſhe informed him of all the reſources of her brother Dara; and ſhe mentioned the names of his principal friends. Many who pretended to be in the intereſt of Aurungzêbe were of the number; though they had yielded for the preſent to the bias of fortune. Without any perſonal affection for Dara, they affected his cauſe from a principle of juſtice. <q rend="inline">"I am rejoiced,

He looked upon his ſchemes as completed; and thought he ſaw Aurungzêbe already ſubmitting to his clemency. In the fulneſs of his heart he ſat down and wrote a letter to Dara. He acquainted the prince, that the bad aſpect of his fortune began to change. <q rend="inline">"Aurungzêbe," ſaid he, "is diſguſted with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of Morâd.

Shaiſta Chan had his ſpies in the preſence; and one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed  him, that a letter had been written, and given in charge to Nahirdil. He ſuſpected that it was intended for Dara; and he occupied the road toward Delhi with ſome faithful friends. Nahirdil had ſcarce iſſued out of the gate of the city, when ſome horſemen ſurrounded and ſeized him. He was brought to Shaiſta, who peruſed the letter. Elevated with the diſcovery, he immediately went to the palace of Aurungzêbe; for that prince

had now taken up his reſidence in the city. The ſlave was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with the greateſt ſecrecy. The prince read the letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out emotion. He had always doubted the emperor's ſincerity, when he promiſed his forgiveneſs to a ſon who had ruined his armies in two battles. He, however, proſecuted his plan of deceit with indefatigable perſeverance. To beſiege his father in the citadel would be an unpopular, if not a dangerous meaſure. The reverence which the army ſtill had for their aged ſovereign, would prevent them from drawing their ſwords againſt him. But the citadel muſt be poſſeſſed, and the perſon of the father muſt be placed in the hands of his ambitious ſon; otherwiſe he may give his hopes to the wind.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe's ſchemes</note>On the fifteenth of June, Aurungzêbe was to have performed his promiſe of viſiting his father in the citadel. The emperor,  full of anxiety, looked forward to the appointed hour, in which he ſaw a period to his misfortunes. A letter from his ſon was delivered into his hands, when he expected him in perſon. He told his father, that his crimes were of ſo deep a dye, that he could not diveſt himſelf of fear that the injured emperor would not forgive him. <q rend="inline">"However much deſirous I am of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour, I cannot riſque my perſonal ſafety in the preſence. The guilty are always timid. Permit me, therefore, to receive the moſt convincing proofs of my ſovereign's forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and let my ſon, Mahommed, who reveres the perſon and authority of his grandfather, be admitted into the citadel with a guard for the protection of my perſon."</q> Shaw Jehân, anxious for the execution of his own project, found, that without conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe propoſals, it muſt be entirely fruſtrated. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returned for anſwer, that Mahommed, with a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, might come.</p>

The emperor, in the mean time, had concealed a  body of men in a court adjoining to the haram. The prince roaming about, lighted on theſe men. He complained to the emperor of an intention againſt his father's perſon; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plainly told him, that till theſe men were removed, he would ſend a meſſenger to Aurungzêbe to ſtop him from coming into the citadel. Shaw Jehân, whether he put ſome confidence in the promiſes of his ſon, or that he thought he could ſeize him by means of the women and eunuchs of the ſeraglio, is uncertain; but he removed the ſoldiers out of the fort, as a proof of his ſincerity. It afterwards appeared, that the emperor reſted his hopes on a number of robuſt Tartar women in the haram, whom he had armed with daggers; and who, from the ſpirit of their country, were fit for an undertaking of boldneſs.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Shaw Jehân taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note>Mahommed, contrary to his expectations, found his party ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior within the citadel. He, however, concealed his intentions.  Every thing was ſettled; and the emperor and his grandſon remained in ſilent expectation. News was at laſt brought, that Aurungzêbe had mounted his horſe; and that the proceſſion of his retinue was approaching. Shaw Jehân was elevated with hopes; but the crafty prince, as if ſtruck with a fit of devotion, ordered his cavalcade to change their courſe, and to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the tomb of Akbâr, where he intended to offer up his prayers to Heaven. When the emperor was informed of this circumſtance, he ſtarted up from his throne in great rage. <q rend="inline">"Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed," ſaid he to the prince, "what means Aurungzêbe by this behaviour? Is he more anxious to appeaſe the ſpirit of his great anceſtor for his crimes, than the offended majeſty of his own father?"</q> Mahommed calmly replied, <q rend="inline">"My father had never any

intention to viſit the emperor." "What then brought Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hither?" retorted Shaw Jehan. "To take charge of the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,"</q> Mahommed coolly rejoined. The emperor finding himſelf betrayed and outwitted by his grandſon, bore him down with a torrent of opprobrious names. The prince, ſeeing his paſſion riſing beyond the bounds of reaſon, retired from the preſence with the uſual obeiſance, and left his rage to ſubſide at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">He offers the empire</note>The emperor, after the heat of his paſſion was over, began to  reflect upon his deplorable condition. He accuſed his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more than his fortune; and he was aſhamed to have fallen into a ſnare which he himſelf had laid. Reſentment and a deſire of immediate revenge prevailed over every other paſſion of his ſoul. He ſent again for Mahommed. The prince came; and found his grandfather with his hand upon the Coran, and his eyes raiſed to the Imperial crown, which was ſuſpended over his head. <q rend="inline">"You ſee, Mahommed," he ſaid, "theſe ſacred objects, before an unfortunate old man. I am overwhelmed with rage, worn out with age and diſeaſe. It is in your power, young man, to make me, for once, happy in my latter days. Releaſe me from priſon; and by theſe," pointing to the crown, and holding the Coran in his hand, "I ſolemnly ſwear to make you emperor of the Moguls."</q> The prince was ſilent; but various paſſions flew alternately over his features. <q rend="inline">"And do you heſitate," begun Shaw Jehân, "to do an action, which will at once gain you the favour of Heaven and the empire of Hindoſtan?

He was ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; nor was he remarkable for his filial piety. He probably  doubted his grandfather's ſincerity; or he did not chuſe to truſt to propoſals impoſed by neceſſity. Aurungzêbe, however, eſcaped from imminent danger through the ſelf-denial of his ſon. Had the emperor appeared in public at the head of his friends, Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe would ſhrink from before him; and the haughty Morâd would fly. The nobles who adhered to the intereſt of the brothers, and even the common ſoldiers had repeatedly declared, that they would not draw their ſwords againſt a prince under whoſe long and auſpicious government their country had ſo much flouriſhed. The firſt repulſe received from Mahommed, did not induce the emperor to relinquiſh his deſigns. He ſent to him a ſecond time; but he refuſed to come to his preſence. He had ſtill the keys of the citadel in his poſſeſſion; and neither Aurungzêbe nor his ſon choſe to uſe force to obtain them from him. Two days paſſed in this ſuſpence. Shaw Jehân was obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and Mahommed ſtood on his guard within the walls. The firſt, however, deſpaired of gaining over the latter to his purpoſe; and, in the evening of the ſecond day, he ſent him the keys of the fortreſs, and deſired him to acquaint his father, that he might now come, in full ſecurity, to ſee his impriſoned ſovereign.</p>

That prince, who knew that he could have no hopes from his father, was much pleaſed at hearing of his impriſonment. Aurungzêbe, in the mean time, ſaluted him emperor, and ſaid; <q rend="inline">"Morâd had before the name, but he now has the power of a ſovereign. My wiſhes," continued he, "are now completely accompliſhed. I have contributed to raiſe a prince, worthy of the throne of our anceſtors, and I have but one favour to aſk for all the fatigue which I have undergone." "Speak your wiſhes," ſaid Morâd, "and they ſhall be inſtantly granted." "This world," replied Aurungzêbe, "has already overwhelmed me too much with its cares. I long to throw the burden away; I am tired of the vain buſtle and pageantry of life.

That prince, who was fond of action, prepared for the field; but he wanted money. The old emperor had concealed part of the Imperial treaſure; Aurungzêbe had ſecreted the reſt. The army of Morâd had not been paid for two months, and they began to murmur. The prince called together all the bankers of Agra. He offered to mortgage part of the revenue, for an immediate loan; but they refuſed to give him credit. He was enraged beyond meaſure, and he prepared to uſe force; when his brother adviſed him againſt an act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and promiſed to diſcharge the arrears due to the army out of his own private fortune. Morâd acceded to the propoſal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving its fatal tendency. Aurungzêbe, by this expedient, became at once popular in the army and in the city.</p>

The preparations for Mecca had been converted into preparations for the field. He told his brother, that he ſtill ſtood in need of his advice. He marched in front from Agra, with a diviſion of the army; and Morâd, having created his uncle Shaiſta, captain-general

The latter prince having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Muttra, received intelligence, that Dara had taken the rout of Lahore. He ſtopt, and waited for the arrival of his brother; who joined him the next day. The latter had, on his march, been convinced by his friends, that his brother had deſigns on his life; and ſelf-preſervation, as well as ambition, rendered it neceſſary for him to prevent the falling blow.</p>

When the brothers ſat at dinner, Nazir Shabâs, high-ſteward of the houſehold, who was in the ſecret, entered ſuddenly, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in Morâd's ear, that now was the time to make a rent in a magnificent dreſs. Aurungzêbe, whoſe eye could trace the thoughts in the features of the face, was alarmed at this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious whiſpering, as well as at the affected gaiety of his brother. He remained ſilent; and Morâd diſpatched Shabâs, with only deſiring him to wait the ſignal. Aurungzêbe was now convinced that there was a deſign againſt his life.

Morâd ſtarted up at this operation; and began to deal around his blows. The lords were terrified, and the prince began to call aloud

The other lords who were attached to the prince, being ſurrounded with armed men, were brought before Aurungzêbe, to whom they ſwore allegiance. A murmur ran through the camp; but it was an ineffectual ſound: and the army, as if but half wakened from a dream, fell faſt aſleep again.</p>

Before day-light appeared, he and his favourite were mounted on an elephant, in a covered amari or caſtle, and ſent off under an eſcort to Agra. Fearing that ſome attempts might be made to reſcue them, Aurungzêbe ordered three other elephants to be ſent off before them, attended by guards to elude purſuers. The precaution was unneceſſary. Mankind forſook Morâd with his fortune. In action, in the manly exerciſes of the field, he had many admirers; but the accompliſhments of his mind acquired him but few friends; and even thoſe whom he favoured with his generoſity, were diſguſted at his haughtineſs. He fell by attempting to be artful. Had he followed, in his deſigns againſt his brother, the natural bias of his own intrepid mind, he could not have failed; but he met that crafty prince in his own province of deceit, and he was foiled. This remarkable tranſaction happened in the camp near Muttra, on the ſixth of July 1658.</p>

to deſpiſe magnificence. His finances, at the ſame time, were low; and he prudently conſidered that money, in the preſent ſituation of affairs, would be better beſtowed upon an army, than on the idle pageantry of ſtate.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections</note>The means taken by Aurungzêbe to obtain the empire, were  ſcarce more juſtifiable, than thoſe by which he ſecured to himſelf the undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the throne. Religion, the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cloke of knavery in all countries, was the chief engine of his ambition; and, in that reſpect, he relied on the credulity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to a degree of unpardonable imprudence. His ſelf-denial and moderate profeſſions agreed ſo little with his actions, that it is even aſhoniſhing, how any perſon of common reflection could have been for a moment deceived. But the vulgar give implicit faith to ſanctity in its moſt queſtionable form; and Morâd, by whoſe popularity and valour his brother overthrew the hopes of Dara, ſuſpected not a duplicity to which his own ſoul was a ſtranger. To deceive that prince, was to ſecure the empire. Bearing more the appearance of an hermit himſelf, than that of a competitor for the throne, the army looked up to Morâd; who being addicted beyond meaſure to pleaſure, gave up the influence as well as the labour of buſineſs to his brother. Aurungzêbe, to ſupport his ambitious views, was obliged to have recourſe to arts which ſtamp his character with meanneſs, whilſt they prove the abilities of his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</note>Morâd, with many commendable qualities, was alſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by diſguſting weakneſſes. Inſtead of that haughty pride  which recommends itſelf in its very abſurdities, he was puffed up
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0828300200:426"/>
with unmanly vanity. A ſtranger to his own merit in thoſe things in which he excelled in the opinion of the world, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated to himſelf praiſe in provinces for which nature had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together rendered him unfit. With an open and generous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he wiſhed to be thought artful and ſevere; and blind to his abilities in the field, he endcavoured to carry the palm in the cabinet. To mention to him the deſigns of his brother, was a ſatire upon his penetration; to ſuggeſt to him caution, was, in his eyes, an accuſation of his courage. He looked not around him into the conduct of others; and he abhorred every enquiry into his own. Under the ſhadow of this careleſs and arrogant vanity in Morâd, his brother fabricated at leiſure his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. But his exceſſive eagerneſs to heighten the deceit, was the means of its being diſcovered. Morâd himſelf ſaw through the veil of flattery which he had laid over his ambitious views; but the vanity, which at firſt induced him to give faith to Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe, made him afterwards deſpiſe his inſincerity. He fell at laſt a victim to his own arrogant folly.</p>

                  <note place="margin">and riſe</note>Aurungzêbe, however, owed not altogether his ſucceſs either to his own hypocriſy, or to the weakneſs of his brother. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally  averſe to pomp and magnificence, he affected all his life that humble deportment which brings the prince near to the people. Without being virtuous from principle, he was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to vice from conſtitution; and he never did an act of injuſtice, till he aſpired to the throne. In his private character, he was an example of decency to others; an affectionate parent, a ſincere friend, a juſt maſter. Deſtitute of that elegance of perſon, and that winning behaviour which had rendered his brothers the idols of the people wherever they moved, he endeavoured to acquire a degree of popularity by the auſterity of his manners. Like the reſt of the family of Timur, he was bred up with very free no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0828300200:427"/>
upon the ſubject of religion; but various circumſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him afterwards to aſſume the appearance of a rigid devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee. His brothers, by encouraging men of all religions, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the followers of Mahommed. The poſterity of thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls, who under Baber conquered India, and ſoldiers of fortune from Tartary and Perſia, occupied the greateſt number of the places of profit and truſt in the empire. Theſe could not ſee, without envy, men of different perſuaſions from themſelves, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the confidence of princes who ſtill profeſſed the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommedan faith. Though ſilent at court, they murmured in ſecret; and lamented the declining ſtate of a religion, under the auſpices of which they had extended their government over India. Aurungzêbe, by his rigid adherence to the tenets incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Coran, gained the eſteem of all thoſe, who, if the expreſſion may be uſed, were the chains which kept together the nations of Hindoſtan under the houſe of Timur. But the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which Aurungzêbe derived from his devotion did not, for many years, ſuggeſt an ambition to aſpire to the empire. He only hoped, that under the cloke of ſanctity, he might paſs in ſafety his life under any of his brothers, whom Fortune might place on the throne.</p>

In his long march from the Decan, his troops ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a moſt exact diſcipline. No ravages were committed; no injuſtice done. When he ſat down with his army in a field of corn, he either paid the eſtimated value to the owners, or gave a receipt for it as a part of the revenue due to the crown. <q rend="inline">"Though I am forced," ſaid he, "into a war by the machinations of Dara, I cannot conſider myſelf as in an enemy's country."</q> When the people came to decide their differences before him, he remanded

He held the ſcepter of India thirty ſolar years, five months and two days; and when he was dethroned, he had arrived at the ſixty-ſeventh year of his age. The means by which Shaw Jehân obtained the empire of the Moguls, were not more juſtifiable than thoſe which he ſo much blamed in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe.

He traced oppreſſion to its moſt ſecret retreats; and, though a lover of money, no ſum could protect offenders from his juſtice. Theft and robbery were, by his prudent regulations, eradicated from his extenſive empire. The governors of the provinces were directed by an edict, to pay out of their private fortunes, the loſſes of the ſubject in that way; which were aſcertained upon oath in a court of juſtice. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the judge was a warrant for the money upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, which they were forced immediately to pay; otherwiſe they were, upon complaint to the emperor, turned out of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſeverely fined.</p>

Though eclipſed by the extraordinary abilities of Mohâbet in war, he was a good general, and an excellent ſoldier. His reputation was ſo high in that reſpect, that he not only kept his own dominions in peace at home, but even made extenſive conqueſts abroad. Rapid in all his meaſures, he cruſhed rebellion before it deſerved the name; for to ſuſpect it in any man, was with him to be prepared.

                  <note place="margin">Solimân</note>The new emperor had ſcarce mounted the throne near Delhi, when he was alarmed with intelligence of the march of Solimân,  by the ſkirts of the northern mountains, to join his father Dara at Lahore. We loſt ſight of that prince in the midſt of his mutinous army, near Allahabâd. The principal nobles who had attended him in his ſucceſsful expedition againſt Suja, deſerted his ſtandard at the firſt news of his father's defeat. The confinement of Shaw Jehân deprived him of more of his followers; but a number, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to deſerve the name of an army, ſtill remained in his camp. Though bold and unconcerned in action, Solimân was ſubject to political fears. The news of repeated misfortunes came daily from every quarter. He became perplexed and undeciſive: various expedients preſented themſelves to his view, but he could fix on none. His firſt reſolution was to return to Bengal; but, dubious of ſucceſs againſt Suja with a reduced and diſpirited army, he dropt that deſign, and gave himſelf up again to wavering ſchemes. He had none to adviſe him; and his own mind afforded no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource in diſtreſs. When intelligence of the march of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate princes from Agra arrived in his camp, he thought of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing the capital, and, by releaſing his grandfather, to add the weight of that monarch's name to his declining cauſe. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, but his evil ſtars prevailed. He changed his courſe, and directed his march to Lahore.</p>

The inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the ſoldier roſe with his contempt of his general. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity was loſt in licentiouſneſs; confuſion, rapine and inſolence

prevailed; and the whole army, inſtead of obeying the prince, placed a merit in their not deſerting his cauſe. That intrepidity and firmneſs which was neceſſary to the occaſion, no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Solimân. His ſtandard had been left by thoſe whom he thought his beſt friends, and a melancholy diſtruſt prevailed in his mind. To correct the licence of the ſoldiery, was to loſe their ſupport. He permitted them, with a vain hope of conciliating their affections, to ravage the country at large. But when they had loaded themſelves with ſpoil, they deſerted in whole ſquadrons, to ſecure their wealth as home, and to avoid the doubtful chance of war.</p>

                  <note place="margin">by his army;</note>Deſtitute of all authority, the prince moved along, ſullen and  ſilent, at the head of an army converted into a mob of banditti. He iſſued out no orders, under a certainty of their not being obeyed; and he even looked with indifference on the gradual decline in the number of his followers. Every morning preſented to his eyes at a diſtance, whole ſquadrons that had quitted his camp in the night. There only remained at laſt four thouſand miſerable wretches, who had ſuffered themſelves to be robbed of their booty. Fear, and not attachment, kept theſe round the ſtandard of Solimân. Their rapine had converted the whole country into an enemy, and there was no longer any ſafety in deſertion. They, however, marked their march with ruin, and covered their rear with the ſmoke of villages, which they had plundered and ſet on fire.</p>

                  <note place="margin">takes</note>Aurungzêbe received certain intelligence of the deſtructive rout of Solimân through the countries of Shinwâra and Muchlis-pour.  He detached Fidai Chan with a conſiderable force to interrupt his march. Shaiſta, who had been left in the government of Agra, was ordered with troops, by a different rout, to prevent the eſcape of the prince by the road through which he had come. He was in no condition to cope with either of thoſe lords. He turned his
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0828300200:436"/>
march to the north, and entered the almoſt impervious country of Serenagûr, where the Ganges iſſues from the mountains into the plains of India. Pirti Singh, the Raja, received the unfortunate fugitive with kindneſs and reſpect. He ſent his own troops to guard the paſſeſ, and permitted the forces of Solimân to encamp in his valleys, to recover from the fatigues of a tedious march. Aurungzêbe, upon receiving advices of the eſcape of the prince, recalled Fidai to the Imperial camp, and ordered Shaiſta to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Agra.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">refuge</note>Safe in the hoſpitality of the prince of Serinagûr, Solimân re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſhut up in a ſecluded country. The mountains, which  protected him from the enemy, prevented him from hearing of the fate of his friends. He became anxious and thoughtful, and diſcovered neither pleaſure nor amuſement in the rural ſports pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by others through the romantic vallies which formed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Raja. He loved to walk alone; to dive into the thickeſt woods; to mix his complaints with the murmur of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which, falling from a thouſand rocks, filled the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with an agreeable noiſe. One day, as the prince wandered from his party, he entered a narrow valley formed by one of the ſtreams which fall headlong from the impaſſable mountains that environ Serinagûr. In the center of the valley there ſtood a mound almoſt covered with trees; through the branches of which appeared undiſtinctly what ſeemed an Indian pagod. The ſtream, divided into two, ſurrounded the mound, and appeared to have worn away the foundations of the rock, on which the building ſtood; which circumſtance rendered it inacceſſible on every ſide. Solimân, pleaſed with this romantic ſcene, rode forward, and found that what he had miſtaken for a temple, was a houſe of pleaſure belonging to the Raja. Thither that prince often retired, with a few attendants, to enjoy the company of ſome Caſhmirian women of exquiſite beauty. Some of theſe were walking on the terrace
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0828300200:437"/>
when Solimân approached. He was ſtruck with their perſons; but he inſtantly retired.</p>

                  <note place="margin">in Serinagûr.</note>When he returned to the reſidence of the Raja, he mentioned  his adventure to that prince. His countenance was ſuddenly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, and he remained for ſome time ſilent. He at length ſaid, <q rend="inline">"All my dominions have I given up to Solimân, yet he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon one little valley which I reſerved for myſelf."</q> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limân excuſed his conduct by his ignorance; but though the Raja pretended to be ſatisfied, there appeared from that day forward a manifeſt change in his behaviour. He became cold and diſtant; and he was diſcontented and agitated when the fugitive prince came before him. Jealouſy, however, was not the cauſe of this alteration. Aurungzêbe had applied to him through his emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; and the honour of that prince contended with his avarice. Solimân became uneaſy at the doubtful gloom which hung on his countenance. He encamped, with his few followers, at ſome diſtance from the Raja's reſidence; and he began to watch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly the conduct of a prince, whom he ſtill called his protector and friend.</p>

He reflected on the paſt with regret; he looked forward to the future with fear. Agitated by various paſſions, he could ſix upon no determined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to extricate himſelf from misfortune; and a panic began to ſeize his troops from the irreſolute undeciſiveneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>

                  <note place="margin">of Dara.</note>Aurungzêbe, who had his ſpies in the camp of Dara, was no  ſtranger to the ſituation of his mind. To add to his panic, he marched from Karnal on the fifteenth of Auguſt, and directed his courſe toward Lahore. Dara, who had remained irreſolute on the banks of the Suttuluz, decamped, upon the news of the enemy's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, with precipitation. The advanced guard of Aurungzêbe paſſed the river without oppoſition; and Dara ſat down with his army behind the Bea, on the road to Lahore, to which city he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſoon after retired, leaving the troops under the conduct of Daood Chan, an able and experienced officer. Dara had great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources in the provinces behind Lahore. The governors had ſtill remained faithful to the old emperor; the revenues of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding year had not been paid; and the prince found a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum in the Imperial treaſury at Lahore. He ſoon raiſed twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand horſe, and his activity had begun to change the aſpect of his affairs. But he had hitherto been unſucceſsful: and he judged of the future by the paſt. He was diſturbed by the news of the approach of a part of the army of Aurungzêbe, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtructed a bridge on the Suttuluz, were on full march to the Bea.</p>

and redoubts, with a firm aſſurance of ſtopping the progreſs of the enemy. The rainy ſeaſon was now come on, and he was under no apprehenſions of not being able to keep the enemy for five months at bay. The northern provinces might, in the mean time, furniſh Dara with an army of hardy ſoldiers. Mohâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, who commanded in Cabul, was in his intereſt; and he rivalled his predeceſſor of the ſame name in his abilities in war. But the evil genius of Dara prevailed. He ſent orders to Daood to quit his poſt. That officer was aſtoniſhed: he ſent a remonſtrance againſt the meaſure to the prince, and the jealous mind of Dara ſuſpected his fidelity. Poſitive orders were ſent: Daood reluctant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed. The prince, finding himſelf wrong in his ſuſpicions, repented of his conduct. He flew into a violent paſſion againſt the accuſers of Daood, and he ordered that officer back to his poſt. It was now too late. The advanced guard of the enemy had croſſed the Bea; and Aurungzêbe, with the main body, arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Suttuluz on the twenty-fifth of Auguſt.</p>

Daood adviſed the prince to give battle, to confirm the courage of his troops by the defeat of a force ſo much inferior in point of numbers. The prince was obſtinate. He alleged, that though his army was more numerous than the enemy, they were not equal to them in diſcipline; that, ſuddenly gathered together, they had not been habituated to danger; and that to engage the rebels, for ſo he affected to call the abettors of Aurungzêbe, would be to haſten the completion of their wiſhes, by giving them an eaſy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. <q rend="inline">"But, Daood!" continued he, "I am not only unfortunate, but weak.

That to remain at Lahore without obtaining a victory, would be as improper as it appeared impoſſible; that ſtill they had rivers which might be defended againſt the whole force of Aurungzêbe; and that if the prince ſhould be pleaſed to blot all unworthy ſuſpicions from his mind, he himſelf would undertake to give him ſufficient time to collect a force in the provinces beyond the Indus. Dara embraced him with tears, and began to retreat. The army, diſcouraged at the apparent irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of their commander, began to fear for themſelves. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt all confidence in the abilities of the prince, they ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before them but diſtreſs to him, and ruin to themſelves. They deſerted in whole ſquadrons; and the unfortunate Dara ſaw his numbers hourly diminiſhing as he advanced toward Moultân. The van of the enemy under Chan Jehân hung cloſe on the heels of the fugitive, and his friends throughout the empire gave all their hopes to the wind.</p>

Chan Jehân, who commanded the vanguard, arriving in Moultân, the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prince fled toward Bicker, and the mountains beyond the Indus. In vain had it been remonſtrated to him by his followers, that he ought to have taken the rout of Cabul.

The troops, though ſilent, had not yet reconciled their minds to the force uſed againſt the perſon of Morâd; and they were, in ſome meaſure, ſhocked at the emperor's breach of faith to a friend as well as a brother. Shaw Jehân, though cloſely confined, had his emiſſaries and friends every where. Whiſpers concerning the unworthy uſage of that great prince were carried round, and heard with attention.

The Maraja was ſtill his friend. Proud and haughty beyond meaſure, he could not forget his defeat by Aurungzêbe, and he was chagrined at the cold reception which that prince had lately given to his proffered allegiance.

The emperor was not to be deceived. He ſaw the views of mankind in their ſituation and character, and took profeſſions of friendſhip from rivals for mere ſounds. He however had behaved with his uſual civility to the meſſenger of Suja.

But Aurungzêbe ſtudiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the time. His march was deſignedly ſlow, till he was joined by his ſon Mahommed with the troops of the north. He then moved forward with great expedition; Mahommed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the van, conſiſting of five thouſand choſen horſe. Suja was aſtoniſhed at this ſudden vigour in his brother's meaſures; he began to fortify his camp, and to make diſpoſitions for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy with warmth.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Fortifies his camp.</note>The prince Mahommed, naturally full of fire, exceeded his orders. He preſſed onward with the van, eager for a ſight of the  enemy; and when he preſented himſelf before Suja, the emperor, with the army and artillery, was forty miles in the rear. He rode along the lines of the enemy, and, with unpardonable raſhneſs, ſeemed to provoke them to battle. Suja, however, for what cauſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, took no advantage of his temerity. The prince at length encamped his ſmall army; and diſpatched a meſſenger with his obſervations on the poſition and ſtrength of the enemy. Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe was offended at the raſhneſs of his ſon. He was, however, gentle in his reproof. <q rend="inline">"When you ſhall poſſeſs the empire, Mahommed," ſaid he, "you muſt protect it with more caution. A monarch ought to be a general rather than a partizan; and few forget folly in valour."</q> The haughty ſpirit of the prince was impatient of rebuke. Active, gallant, and ſiery, he deſpiſed the ſlow dictates of Prudence; and would rather owe his fame to his ſword, than to political management and addreſs.</p>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0828300200:447"/>
extenſive plain, very ſit for a battle, between him and the lines of Suja. He drew up his army, on the morning of the fifteenth, in two lines, advancing his artillery ſome paces in the front. About twelve o'clock the cannon began to open on both ſides. Suja had placed his artillery on a riſing-ground, and his batteries were well ſerved. He ſcoured the enemy's lines; and Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe, who durſt not attack the trenches, was obliged to return with ſome loſs to his camp. Suja took no advantage of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of his brother. He retired within his lines, and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently neglected to keep poſſeſſion of the riſing-ground on the right, from which his artillery had played with ſuch advantage on the enemy. Meer Jumla, who had arrived a few days before from the Decan, obſerved the negligence of Suja. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the advantage which Fortune had offered to Aurungzêbe; and that prince ordered him to take poſſeſſion of the hill in the night. Before morning appeared, Jumla threw up a redoubt on the place, and lined it with cannon; which were covered with a ſtrong party of ſpearmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The battle begins.</note>When day-light appeared, Jumla ordered his battery on the  hill to open. The tents of Suja were in the range of the ſhot; and the prince was obliged immediately to ſtrike them, and to move his quarters to the left. Aurungzêbe, who perceived the commotion in the enemy's camp, on account of the unexpected fire from the battery, thought this a proper opportunity to make a general aſſault. His army were already formed; and he ordered his elephants to advance with all expedition to tread down the entrenchments. A ſtrong body of cavalry ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the charge. The defendants, already in confuſion, made but a faint reſiſtance. The elephants ſoon levelled the entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the horſe poured into the camp. Flight, confuſion, and ſlaughter prevailed. Aurungzêbe, mounted on a lofty ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0828300200:448"/>
ſaw the appearance of victory on every ſide. He puſhed forward into the center, to render complete the advantage which he had already obtained. But Fortune took a ſudden change; and inevitable ruin ſeemed to overwhelm him and his affairs.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Treachery of the Maraja.</note>The Maraja, Jeſſwint Singh, having made his peace with  Aurungzêbe, had joined that prince with his native troops. His defeat at Ugein remained ſtill freſh in his mind; and he longed to recover the laurels which he had loſt in that unfortunate field. He had received orders to advance with his Rajaputs; and he even made a ſhew of attacking the enemy. But when he ſaw the emperor entering their camp, he ſuddenly turned, and fled with all his forces. The Moguls, however, followed not his example. Aurungzêbe carried forward on his elephant the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial ſtandard; and they were aſhamed to leave it to the enemy. Jeſſwint, diſappointed in his aim of drawing his party to flight by his own, fell ſuddenly on the rear of the line. He ſeized upon the baggage; and put ſervants and women to the ſword, without either diſtinction or mercy. The noiſe of the ſlaughter behind was carried to the front, which was engaged with Suja in the center of his camp. Some fled to ſave their wives; and, cowards, wanting only an example, they were ſollowed by thouſands. The lines began to thin apace; the attack was ſuſtained with leſs vigour; and the enemy acquired courage.</p>

To fly was certain ruin; to remain, an almoſt certain death. He ſat aloft on his elephant, in full poſſeſſion of his own mind; and he ſeemed not to know that any diſaſter had happened in the rear. The enemy, who had been tumultuouſly hurrying out of the camp, returned with
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0828300200:449"/>
vigour to the charge, upon the ſudden change in the face of affairs. Suja, with an undaunted countenance, led the attack, ſtanding in the caſtle, upon an enormous elephant. When his eye fell upon his brother, he ordered his driver to direct the furious animal that way. One of the principal officers of Aurungzêbe, who was alſo mounted on an elephant, perceiving the intention of Suja, ruſhed in before the prince. He was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in the firſt ſhock, but the elephant of Suja ſuffered ſo much in the concuſſion, that the animal ſtood trembling through every joint; having loſt all ſenſe of command, and almoſt the power of motion. The diſappointed prince ſeemed enraged at his fortune; but the elephant of one of his nobles advanced againſt that of the emperor; and, in the firſt ſhock, the latter animal fell upon his knees; and it was with great difficulty he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf. Aurungzêbe had one foot out of the caſtle, ready to alight. The crown of India hovered on the reſolution of a moment. Meer Jumla was near, on horſeback: <q rend="inline">"Stop," ſaid he, turning ſternly to Aurungzêbe; "you deſcend from the throne."</q> The emperor, who was now compoſed, ſeemed to ſmile at the reproof. Whilſt the animals continued to engage, the markſman, who ſat behind him, ſhot the adverſary's driver; but the enraged elephant continued, notwithſtanding, to ſight. Aurungzêbe was now in imminent danger; when he was delivered from deſtruction by the reſolution of his driver. He threw himſelf dexterouſly on the neck of the other elephant, and carried him off; whilſt his own place was ſupplied by one of the officers who ſat behind the caſtle. Another elephant, in the mean time, advanced againſt Aurungzêbe; but he had the good fortune to ſhoot the driver with his own hand.</p>

                  <note place="margin">and of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe;</note>The emperor now found that his own elephant, from the  many ſhocks which he had received, was much weakened and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0828300200:450"/>
diſpirited. He began to be afraid that he could not even keep the animal in the field. To alight would be equal to flight itſelf. The elephant began to turn; and Aurungzêbe, whoſe reſolution never failed him in deſperate ſituations, ordered the chains, which are always ready for binding him, to be locked round his feet. The emperor remained immoveable amidſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; a thouſand ſhot were aimed at him, a thouſand arrows fell into the caſtle; but being in complete armour, he remained unhurt. Some of the nobles obſerving this daring behaviour in their prince, ruſhed forward to his reſcue. They bore all before them in this laſt effort; and Suja, in the moment of victory, was beginning to give way. His elephant, diſabled by the firſt ſhock, was not to be moved forward. Aliverdi, one of his friends, came with a horſe; and Suja, in an evil hour, deſeended from his lofty ſeat. The ſame conduct had ruined Dara. The elephant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the rear, with an empty caſtle, the army thought that the prince was ſlain; and they began to fly on every ſide.</p>

                  <note place="margin">who obtains the victory.</note>Aurungzêbe, who owed his victory to his own intrepidity, was in no condition to purſue the enemy. Night was now coming on; and he lay on the field under arms. During the action, the  Maraja had defeated the party left to defend the baggage; and loading camels with the booty, ſent them off under an eſcort. He himſelf ſtill hovered round the rear. The proximity of the Imperial tents to the line, had hitherto protected them from being plundered by the Rajaputs. Night coming on, the Maraja ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; and, about an hour after it was dark, fell upon the tents of Mahommed, who had remained with his ſather on the ſield. A few, who defended the quarter of the prince, were cut off to a man; and the Rajaputs advanced to the Imperial tents, and ſeized upon every thing valuable within the ſquare; putting every one that oppoſed them to the ſword. The night became a ſcene of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0828300200:451"/>
horror, confuſion, and death. Aurungzêbe was not to be moved from the field; but he detached a part of the army to oppoſe the Maraja. When day appeared, the troops of Suja were no more to be ſeen; and the emperor, now convinced of his victory, turned his arms upon the Maraja. That prince ſtood his ground. A bloody battle enſued. The Rajaputs retreated; but they carried their booty away.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Suja purſued by Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note>Suja fled with ſo much precipitation in the night, that he left  all his tents, equipage, and artillery, on the field. His army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him; and he even deſerted his army. He changed his clothes, he threw off every mark of diſtinction, and hurried for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Patna like a private man. He feared no enemy; but he was afraid of his friends. When Fortune had forſaken him, he hoped not to retain their faith; for to deliver him to Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe would not only procure their ſafety, but advance their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. The ſun was ſcarce up, when Aurungzêbe detached ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, under his ſon Mahommed, in purſuit of his brother. The enemy were ſo much diſſipated, that ſew were ſlain. The inſtructions of the prince were to follow Suja. He arrived at Patna, and the unfortunate prince ſled to Mongeer; hoping to derive from walls that ſafety which he could not command in the field. His courage, however, forſook him not in his diſtreſs. He had ſtill reſources in his own active mind; and the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Bengal was devoted to his intereſt, from the ſtrict juſtice and mildneſs of his government.</p>

He had marked, from his elephant, the particular behaviour of each. He puniſhed ſome for cowardice; others he promoted for valour. His reproofs were ſtrong and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0828300200:452"/>
pointed; the praiſe he beſtowed manly and juſt. He, at the ſame time, made a long ſpeech from the throne. He aſſumed no merit to himſelf, he even gave up that of his army, and attributed his ſucceſs to Providence. He involved Heaven in his quarrel with his brothers; and made it the partner of his own guilt. This religious oration was received with burſts of applauſe. Mankind are in all ages and nations ſuperſtitious; and the bare profeſſion of ſancity hides the blackeſt crimes from their eyes. Aurungzêbe, however, did not forget his temporal affairs in his devotion. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious for the reduction of Bengal, and for an end of the war with Suja, he detached a large body of horſe under Meer Jumla, to reinforce Mahommed, whilſt he himſelf took the rout of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.</p>

News of the defeat of Aurungzêbe had already  filled that capital with ſurprize. The appearance of the Raja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts confirmed the report. The adherents of the new emperor began to ſhift for themſelves; and grief and joy prevailed, as men were variouſly affected to this or the other ſide. Shaiſta, who commanded in the city, was ſtruck with melancholy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. He knew the active part which he himſelf had taken for Aurungzêbe; and he could expect no favour from the conquerors. He even made attempts againſt his own life; and ſeemed indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent about ſhutting the gates of the citadel againſt Jeſſwint Singh. That prince, though he ſuffered little in the running fight with Aurungzêbe, was ſtill afraid of the Imperial army, which followed cloſe on his heels. Had he boldly entered the city, taken advantage of the panic of Shaiſta, and releaſed Shaw Jehân, Aurungzêbe might ſtill be ruined. But the fortune of that prince was ſtill greater than his abilities.</p>

He directed his courſe to his own country; and, though incumbered with ſpoil, outſtripped his purſuers in the march. Aurungzêbe entered Agra without any pomp.

His army fell off gradually in his flight. His affairs  were deſperate, and their attachment gave way to perſonal ſafety. Four thouſand ſtill adhered to their colours, with which number Dara encamped near Bicker, having garriſoned the place, and ſubmitted it to the command of a faithful friend. He had ſcarce pitched his tents, when the enemy came in ſight. Though worn-out with fatigue, he was obliged to fly. He found boats by accident, and croſſed the Indus with all his followers. On the oppoſite ſhore ſtood the ſtrong fortreſs of Sicar. Struck with the hard fate of Dara, the governor opened the gates. But it was not the buſineſs of the prince to ſhut himſelf up within walls; which at beſt could only protract misfortune. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced the garriſon with a part of his troops; and left ſome valuable effects under the protection of the governor.</p>

He wandered away in a melancholy mood. His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful  adherents, for only thoſe whoſe attachment to his perſon overcame their own fears were now in his train, followed ſilently the path of a maſter whom they loved. Having marched a few miles, the prince came to the place where the road parted into two; the one leading to Tatta, the other toward the Perſian province of Choraſſan. Starting from his reverie, he ſtood for ſome time irreſolute. On the one ſide there was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ruin; on the other, a certainty of perſonal ſafety. But glory was blended with diſgrace in the firſt; in the latter there was nothing but obſcurity and diſhonour. When he weighed theſe things in his mind, the chariots in which were his women arrived. His perplexity increaſed. The deſart toward Perſia was extenſive and unhoſpitable; on the ſide of India, his own misfortunes muſt overwhelm his family. He could not decide; and a melancholy ſilence prevailed around.</p>

                  <note place="margin">but changes his courſe to Tatta.</note>The favourite Sultana, ſeeing the undeciſiveneſs of Dara, at length put an end to his doubts. <q rend="inline">"Can the firſt of the race of  Timur," ſhe ſaid, "heſitate in this moment of diſtreſs? There is danger, but there may be alſo a throne on one ſide; but a frightful ſolitude, and the cold reception given to fugitive princes by ſtrangers, threaten from the other. If Dara cannot decide, I, who am the daughter of Purvêz, will decide for myſelf. This hand ſhall prevent me, by death, from diſhonour. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant of the immortal Timur ſhall not grace the haram of the race of Sheick Seſi!"</q> The features of the prince were at once lighted up into a kind of mournful joy. He burſt into tears; and, without uttering a word, ſpurred forward his horſe toward Tatta. He had not remained many days in that city, when he
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0828300200:456"/>
received advices that a conſiderable detachment of the enemy was arrived within a few miles of the place. He evacuated Tatta, croſſed the Indus, and fled toward the capital of Guzerat. The enemy laid a bridge of boats over the river; and were preparing to purſue the fugitive, when unexpected orders arrived for them to repair with all expedition to join the Imperial army, in full march againſt Suja.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Croſſes the deſart.</note>The removal of the Imperial troops procured a happy reſpite  for Dara; but it was but a tranſient gleam of Fortune, who had reſolved to continue her frowns. The road of the prince lay partly through burning ſands, deſtitute of water; partly through abrupt mountains, covered with impervious woods, the haunts of beaſts of prey. His people were parched with thirſt; his very camels died of fatigue. His unfortunate women were juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring for want of water, when the prince, who ranged the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes far and wide, lighted on a ſpring. He encamped near it; and having refreſhed his attendants, arrived next day on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the territories of the Raja's Jâm and Bahâra, which lay contiguous to each other in his rout. They received him with hoſpitality; but they declined to embrace his cauſe. They were the natural enemies of the houſe of Timur, who had, often from views of conqueſt, penetrated into their almoſt inacceſſible country. When perſuaſion failed, Dara endeavoured to work upon the pride of Jâm. He propoſed an alliance between his ſon Sipper Shekô, the conſtant attendant of his misfortunes, and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Raja. The match did not take place. The few Mogul nobles who adhered to him, were ſo much diſſatisfied with the propoſal, on account of its inequality, that it was laid aſide; and Dara proceeded to Ahmedabâd.</p>

When Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râd  was ſeized, Aurungzêbe ſent a new commiſſion to Shaw Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wâz, which that lord received, and governed his province in the name of the new emperor. He prepared to oppoſe Dara with all his forces. The match was unequal, and the prince, hemmed in with misfortunes on every ſide, began to deſpair. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, reſolved to carry no longer round the empire a life obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to miſery. He advanced with his few attendants; and, as the laſt reſort, wrote a letter to the younger daughter of Shaw Nawâz, who was the wife of Morâd, and had been left with her father when the prince marched toward Agra. He recounted his own misfortunes; and compared them with thoſe of her huſband. <q rend="inline">"The enemy of both is one," ſaid he: "if the memory of the unfortunate Morâd ſtill lives in the breaſt of his wife, ſhe will perſuade her father to favour Dara, who is oppreſſed by the ſame untoward fate!"</q>

She graſped at the ſhadow of hope for her huſband's releaſement, which was offered by a prince overwhelmed by his own bad fortune. She threw herſelf at the feet of her father; her tears ſuppreſſed her voice; but ſhe looked up to him with that forcible eloquence of eyes, which it is impoſſible to reſiſt from beauty in diſtreſs. She placed the letter of Dara in his hands. He read it with emotion; and turned away in ſilence. She followed him on her knees, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſkirt of his robe. <q rend="inline">"Is not my daughter," ſaid he, "al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently wretched?

                  <note place="margin">Raiſes an army.</note>The prince could ſcarce believe his own eyes, when he received the letter of the wife of Morâd. A gleam of hope came in upon his  misfortunes. He entered Ahmedabâd; and the governor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with the higheſt diſtinction and reſpect. He gave to the prince about one hundred and twenty thouſand pounds in money, together with jewels to a great amount, to contribute to raiſe troops. This new life to the affairs of Dara, rendered him active in his preparations for war. In a few weeks he found himſelf at the head of a conſiderable army. He in the mean time received letters from the Maraja, who, with his native troops, was on his march with Aurungzêbe to attack Suja. That prince acquainted him of his deſign of deſerting the new emperor in the action; and we have already ſeen that he kept his promiſe. He conjured Dara to haſten his march to ſupport him in his intended defection. The advice was good; but the evil genius of Dara prevailed. He delayed, that he might aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his forces; and loſt the golden opportunity of reſtoring his affairs by an act of boldneſs and intrepidity.

A ſtranger to the motive of the Hindoo, he ſent his ſon Sipper Shekô to endeavour to prevail upon him to throw off his inactivity.

Dara halted with his army in this paſs. His high opinion of the European mode of war, which he imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Engliſh, French and Portugueſe in his ſervice, had rendered that prince fond of entrenchments. He had conſidered the appearance of ſecurity, more than the movements of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind: for armies often take entrenchments in no other light than as a proof of the ſuperiority of the enemy. He threw up lines from hill to hill in his front, and ſtrengthened them with artillery.

He continued the work the whole night, and covered his men before day-light appeared, notwithſtanding his brother had ſallied thrice during that time. The ſun was ſcarce riſen, when Debere, and ſome other nobles, iſſued out of the camp, and advanced on full ſpeed with five thouſand horſe near the lines; hoping, by inſulting him, to draw Dara from his lines. They paid dear for their temerity. The artillery of the enemy being well ſerved, galled the aſſailants ſo much, that they retreated in diſorder, and were glad to ſhelter themſelves behind their own lines. Things remained in this doubtful ſituation for ſeveral days. The army of Dara, having the country in their rear open, were in no want of proviſions; and were, therefore, under no neceſſity of retreating; and it was impoſſible, without a long ſiege, to overcome their almoſt impregnable lines.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His ſtratagem</note>Fortune, who never forſook Aurungzêbe, relieved his anxiety upon this occaſion. A petty Indian prince, who commanded three  thouſand of his native infantry in the Imperial army, informed himſelf of a narrow and ſteep path, by which men, accuſtomed to climb, might aſcend the mountain on the right of Dara's lines. He communicated his information to the emperor, who was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed

He had, during the night, planned the ruin of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's affairs, by a more fatal ſtroke of policy than the ſtratagem of the Raja. Debere Chan, and the Indian prince, Joy Singh, had, at the beginning of the war, adhered with warmth to the intereſts of Dara. Under the prince Solimân, they had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves in the defeat of Suja, and the reduction of Bengal. Yielding to the preſſure of the times, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of Aurungzêbe, they deſerted, as has been already related, the colours of Solimân; and ruined all the hopes which the unfortunate Dara derived from the victorious army under his ſon. To theſe chiefs the emperor applied with much addreſs. He promiſed largely; and he mixed threats with his proffered favour. He at length prevailed upon them to write an inſidious letter to Dara, to the following purpoſe:</p>

With how much fidelity they obeyed his orders, they derive a proof from their actions, under the command of the illuſtrious prince Solimân Shekô.

The acceſſion of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants to his power, though not neceſſary to his affairs, will bring them to a more ſpeedy concluſion. When, therefore, day-light ſhall appear, let the gate of the camp be opened to receive us; that we may have an opportunity of regaining, by our merit, the favour, of which we have been deprived by neceſſity. As ſoon as the ſun ſhall ariſe, we look for admittance into the camp, with all our followers and friends."</q>

Shaw Nawâz in vain remonſtrated to him, in the ſtrongeſt terms, that there was danger in conſiding in their ſincerity.

He was obſtinate; and determined to riſque all on the faith of men who had, a few months before, betrayed his ſon.

Theſe officers accordingly ruſhed forth; and Aurungzêbe, to carry on the deceit, began to fire with his artillery, but with powder only, on the pretended deſerters. Dara, full of expectation, ſtood on the rampire. When he ſaw the ſquadrons advancing, he ordered the gate to be thrown open; but Mahommed Sherif, who, with a choſen body, ſtood without the lines, being ſtill dubious of the intentions of the fugitives, ordered them to ſtop, till he ſhould be ſatisfied of their real deſigns.</p>

When they heard of the meſſage of the governor, they deſpaired of the affairs of Dara, and added their own cruelty to his misfortunes. In a pretence of having large arrears of their pay due to them, they fell upon his baggage, and plundered it in his preſence. Some caſkets of jewels were ſaved by his women; for even in that ſeaſon of licence and diſorder, their perſons were ſacred from barbarity itſelf. This outrage was committed in the night. When day-light appeared, the robbers, as if aſhamed of their conduct, fled with their ſpoil. A few only of the loweſt menial ſervants remained.

A few beaſts of burden were collected by his ſervants; and the robbers, who had deſerted and plundered his camp, had left to him the two elephants which he had brought from Ajmere.

She knew his ſituation, and requeſted earneſtly that they ſhould move away. <q rend="inline">"Death," ſaid ſhe, "will ſoon relieve the daughter of Purvez from her misfortunes; but let her not add to thoſe of her lord."</q> She could not prevail upon him to march whilſt ſhe was in ſuch a ſituation; and he had, beſides, placed great hopes in the friendſhip of Jihon Chan, a neighbouring chief of great power. Jihon had been twice ſaved from death by the intereſt of Dara. Shaw Jehân, who was an enemy to oppreſſion, had ordered him to be, at two different times, proſecuted for murder and treaſon, before the chief juſtice of the empire. That judge, upon the cleareſt proofs, condemned him twice to death; and, at the requeſt of Dara, he was pardoned by the emperor, and reſtored to his eſtate which had been confiſcated. The prince, therefore, had reaſon to expect a return of gratitude; but the obligations were too great for the pride of this unprincipled chief, and they preſſed upon him like injuries.</p>

The prince, naturally obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,  was now blinded by his fate. He could not think of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his beloved Nadîra in the hour of death; and he reſolved to riſque all for the melancholy ſatisfaction of being preſent when the faithful companion of his diſtreſs expired. Some nobles, who had hitherto attended his perſon, and who had determined to accompany him in his exile to Perſia, ſeparated themſelves from a prince devoted to ruin. With ſeventy domeſtics only, he went to the reſidence of Jihon; and that chief, apprized of his coming, came out to meet him, and received him with the warmeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions  of friendſhip.<note place="margin">June 21ſt.</note> He quitted his own palace to accommodate the prince; and nothing was to be ſeen around but the greateſt marks of hoſpitality and profound reſpect.</p>

In the evening one of his faithful ſervants joined him with fifty horſe. He was overjoyed at his arrival, and, ſtarting up, took him in his arms, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My ſituation, Gal Mahommed," for that was the officer's name, "is not without reſource.

Dara reſolved to make his eſcape into Perſia. He called his ſervants together, and he took leave of Jihon.

The emperor, though he rejoiced at the news that his brother had fallen into his hands, was full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and indeciſion. He called a council of his nobles; and they differed in their opinions; ſome, declaring for ſending him by another rout to the caſtle of Gualiâr; ſome, that he ſhould be carried through the city, to convince mankind that he was fallen for ever. Many adviſed againſt a meaſure that might be full of danger from the humanity of the people; a few argued, that ſuch conduct would degrade the dignity of the family of Timur. Others maintained, to whoſe opinion the emperor himſelf ſeemed to lean, that it was neceſſary he ſhould paſs through the capital, to aſtoniſh mankind with the abſolute power and invincible fortune of Aurungzêbe.</p>

No. It was an old animal, dirty and lean, with a tattered cover, a pitiful ſeat, and the caſtle open on all ſides to the winds. The ſplendid ornaments of his perſon were now vaniſhed, like his good fortune. A dirty dreſs of coarſe linen ſcarce covered his body from the weather; and his wretched turban was wrapt round with a ſcarf made of Caſhmire wool. His face, which formerly commanded reſpect with the manly regularity of its features, was now parched and ſhrivelled by being long expoſed to the heat; and a few ſtraggling locks, which appeared from his turban, preſented a grey colour unſuitable to his years. In this wretched ſituation he entered Delhi; and, when the mob who crowded to the gates knew that it was Dara, they burſt into loud complaints, and ſhed a flood of tears. The ſtreets were rendered almoſt impaſſible by the number of the ſpectators; the ſhops were full of perſons of all ages and degrees. The elephant moved ſlowly; and the progreſs he made was marked to thoſe who were diſtant by the advancing murmur among the people. Nothing was heard around but loud complaints againſt Fortune, and curſes on Aurungzêbe. But none had the boldneſs to offer to reſcue the unfortunate prince, though ſlightly guarded.

The infectious ſorrow flew over the whole city: even the pooreſt

people forſook their work, and retired to ſecret corners to weep. Dara retained his dignity upon this trying occaſion. He uttered not one word; but a ſettled melancholy ſeemed to dwell on his face. The unfortunate young prince was ready frequently to weep, being ſoftened by the complains of the people; but his father checked him with a ſtern look, and he endeavoured to conceal his tears. Dara, having been thus led through the principal ſtreets of Delhi, was conducted to Chizerabâd, a village four miles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the walls. He was locked up, with his ſon, in a mean apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which he remained for ſome days in hourly expectation of his death. Here he amuſed himſelf with writing inſtructions for his ſon Solimân; having concealed an ink ſtandiſh and ſome paper in one of the folds of his garment. His anxiety to know the intentions of Aurungzêbe, ſometimes broke in upon his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy amuſements. He appeared through the window to the guards; but they knew nothing of what paſſed at court. He then enquired concerning an old devotee, who had formerly lived in a cell near the foot of the Imperial garden at Delhi. One of the ſoldiers knew the old man; and the prince gave a billet to be carried to him, requeſting ſome intelligence. <q rend="inline">"But even he, perhaps," he ſaid, with a ſigh, "may have changed with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the times."</q>

Paſſing through the city of Delhi, he was pointed out to the mob, who, falling upon him near the gate which leads to Lahore, killed ſeven of his attendants.

The zeal of the people, however, proved fatal to Dara. The emperor, hearing of the tumult near the gate of Lahore, ordered the chief magiſtrate of the city, with his officers, to go to the place, and enquire into the cauſe of the diſturbance. The mob fell upon the judge and his attendants. They fled to the palace, and the whole city was in an uproar.</p>

which he had concealed to mend the reed with which he wrote. He ſtood in a corner of the room. The murderers did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately attack him. They ordered his ſon to remove to the adjoining apartment; but he clung round his father's knees. Two of the aſſaſſins ſeized him, to force him away; when Dara, ſeeing Nazir ſtanding at the door, begged to be indulged a few moments to take leave of his ſon. He fell upon his neck, and ſaid,<q rend="inline"> "My dear ſon, this ſeparation is more afflicting than that between ſoul and body, which I am this moment to ſuffer. But ſhould HE ſpare you—live.

Deeming this an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous death, he, with an eſſort, diſincumbered his hand, and ſtabbed, with his pen-knife, one of the villains to the heart. The others, terrified, fled back; but as he was riſing from the floor, they fell upon him with their ſwords. His ſon, hearing the noiſe, though his hands were bound, burſt open the door, and

Dara was certainly jealous of his brothers, whom he ſaw inveſted with too much power in their reſpective provinces; and his oppoſing their meaſures at court was the natural conſequence of his fears. This mutual animoſity being once kindled, all the princes looked forward to the death of their father with terror.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note>THE fears of the emperor from the moſt formidable of his rivals, were extinguiſhed with the life of Dara. The ſilence which accompanies the deciſions of deſpotiſm, is an effectual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention  of tumult and confuſion. The people, for ſome days, were ſtrangers to the death of the prince, and his prior misfortunes had even leſſened the regret, which his murder might have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe created in the minds of mankind. Miſery had riſen to its height; and the worſt period it could have, was in ſome degree fortunate. The conduct of the emperor contributed to obliterate his crimes. With an appearance of humanity and benevolence in the common operations of government, men were apt to attribute the inſtances of cruelty which he exhibited, to the neceſſity of his ſituation; and they forgot the evils done to individuals, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of the whole. Should ſelf-preſervation be admitted

as an excuſe for the commiſſion of bad actions, Aurungzêbe was not without apology. He had gone too far not to go farther ſtill: he had depoſed his father, he had excluded his brother from the throne, and a flame had been kindled which could be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nothing but blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Preparations of Suja.</note>During the misfortunes of Dara in the weſt and north, the war was carried on with vigour in Bengal againſt Suja. That prince  having, after the unfortunate battle of Kidgwâ, eſcaped to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geer, was active in making new preparations for the field. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally bold and intrepid, misfortune had no effect upon him but to redouble his diligence to retrieve it; and he wanted not reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his province for recommencing hoſtilities, with an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being able for ſome time to ward off the hand of Fate, which ſeemed to hang over his head. His firſt care was to collect the remains of his diſſipated army in the neighbourhood of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geer, which commands the paſs into Bengal; and, whilſt he was collecting more troops from the extenſive country in his rear, he drew lines from the mountains to the Ganges, to ſtop the progreſs of the enemy.</p>

The prince was ſoon joined by Jumla the viſier, with a great force; and they proceeded ſlowly down along the banks of the Ganges. The ſtrong poſition of Suja gave him a manifeſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and Jumla, an able and experienced officer, contrived to drive him from his poſt without bloodſhed. The ridge of mountains to the right of the Ganges are, in their fertile valleys, poſſeſſed by petty, but independent princes. Jumla found means to draw theſe over to his party; and they ſhewed to him a paſſage through their country, by which he could turn the rear of Suja. Having, by
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0828300200:482"/>
way of blind, left a conſiderable part of the army to fall down, in the common rout, along the river, he himſelf, accompanied by the prince, entered the mountains, and was heard of by Suja in his rear, when he expected to be attacked in front. Suja de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped with precipitation; but he arrived in the environs of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ja-Mâhil ſome days before Jumla iſſued from the mountains. He fortified himſelf in his camp; and the viſier, who could make no impreſſion without artillery, marched toward the left, to join the army coming down along the Ganges.</p>

Jumla played inceſſantly with his artillery upon the fortifications, which being only made up of hurdles and looſe ſandy ſoil, were ſoon ruined. Suja's poſt becoming untenable, he decamped under the favour of night; and Jumla, afraid of an ambuſh, though he was appriſed of the retreat of the enemy, durſt not follow him.

His effeminate troops acquired confidence from a well-ſerved artillery; and even Aurungzêbe, who confided much in the abilities of Jumla, was not without anxiety.

He ſeemed even to have forgot his betrothed wife in his activity in the field; but the princeſs, moved by the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of her father, wrote with her own hand a very moving letter to Mahommed. She lamented her unhappy fate, in ſeeing the prince whom ſhe loved, armed againſt her father. She expreſſed her paſſion and unfortunate condition, in terms which found their way to his heart. His former affections were rekindled in all their fury; and, in the elevation of his mind, he reſolved to deſert his father's cauſe.</p>

He opened the affair to ſome of his friends: he complained of his father's coldneſs, and even of his ingratitude, to a ſon, to whom, as having ſeized the perſon of Shaw Jehân, he owed the empire. He gave many inſtances of his own ſervices; many of the unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns made by Aurungzêbe, and concluded by declaring his fixed reſolution to join Suja. They endeavoured to diſſuade him from ſo raſh an action; but he had taken his reſolution, and he would

He, however, after ſome heſitation, reſolved to diſcharge the part of a good officer. He ſet out expreſs for the camp, where he arrived next day. He found things in the utmoſt confuſion, but not in ſuch a deſperate ſituation as he had expected.

no ſtrangers, my fellow-ſoldiers, to the flight of the prince Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed, and to his having preferred the love of the daughter of Suja to his allegiance to his ſovereign and father. Intoxicated by the ſame to which your valour had raiſed him, he has long been preſumptuous in his hopes. Ambition brought him to the edge of the precipice over which he has been thrown by love. But in abandoning you, he has abandoned his fortune; and, after the firſt tranſports are over, regret, and a conſciouſneſs of folly, will only remain. Suja has perhaps pledged his faith to ſupport the infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated prince againſt his father; he may have even promiſed the throne of India as a reward for his treachery. But how can Suja perform his promiſe? We have ſeen his hoſtile ſtandards—but we have ſeen them only to be ſeized. Bengal abounds with men, with proviſions, with wealth; but valour is not the growth of that ſoil. The armies of Aurungzêbe are numerous; like you they are drawn from the north, and he is himſelf as invincible in the field as he is wiſe and deciſive in the cabinet.</q>

He immediately began to throw a bridge of boats acroſs the river. The work was finiſhed in three days; and he paſſed the Ganges with his whole army. Mahommed, in the mean time, having arrived at Tanda, was received with every mark of reſpect by Suja. The nuptials were celebrated with the utmoſt magnificence and pomp; and the feſtivity was ſcarce over, when certain news arrived of the near approach of the Imperial army under Jumla.

Jumla, conſcious of the ſuperiority of his own troops in point of valour, was glad to find the enemy in the open field.

A great ſlaughter was made in the purſuit, and Tanda opened her gates to the conqueror. The

He however had not advanced far from Delhi, when intelligence of the ſucceſs of his arms in the battle of Tanda met him on his way, and he forthwith returned to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.

He became  ſilent and diſcontented. He had an affection for the prince, and he was more enraged at being diſappointed in the judgment which he had formed, than at the ſuppoſed treachery. Having continued three days in this agitation of mind, he at laſt ſent for the prince. He told him, in the preſence of his council, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the ſtruggles of affection with ſuſpicion, the latter had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; that he could no longer behold Mahommed with an eye of friendſhip, ſhould he even ſwear to his innocence in the holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Mecca; that the bond of union and confidence which had lately ſubſiſted between them was broken; and that, inſtead of a ſon and a friend, he beheld him in the light of an enemy. <q rend="inline">"It is therefore neceſſary for the peace of both," continued Suja, "that Mahommed ſhould depart.

Naturally open and generous, he deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the duplicity of his father, and diſdained power that muſt be preſerved by art. His free converſations upon theſe ſubjects eſtranged from him the affections of his father, who ſeems to have confeſſed this merit by his own fears.

A public pretence muſt be made to gain the wealth of Suja, and to appeaſe his enemies by his death. The report of a conſpiracy againſt the Raja was induſtriouſly ſpread abroad. It was affirmed that Suja had formed a deſign to mount the throne of Arracân, by aſſaſſinating its monarch. The thing was in itſelf improbable.

The greateſt part of the friends of Suja were at length either ſlain or wounded. He himſelf ſtill ſtood undaunted, and defended the paſs againſt the cowardly troops of Arracân. They durſt not approach hand to hand; and their miſſive weapons flew wide of their aim.

The officer who commanded the party, ſent in the mean time ſome of his ſoldiers to the top of the precipice, to roll down ſtones on the prince and his gallant friends. One fell on the ſhoulder of Suja; and he ſunk down, being ſtunned with the pain. The enemy took advantage of his fall. They ruſhed forward, diſarmed and bound him.</p>

The  officer told him, that his orders were to ſend him down the ſtream to Pegû. Two of his friends threw themſelves into the canoe, as they were puſhing it away from the bank. The wife and the daughters of Suja, with cries which reached heaven, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves headlong into the river. They were, however, brought aſhore by the ſoldiers; and carried away, together with the ſon of Suja, who was wounded, to the Raja's palace. The prince, ſad and deſolate, beheld their diſtreſs; and, in his ſorrow, heeded not his own approaching fate. They had now rowed to the middle of the ſtream; but his eyes were turned toward the ſhore. The rowers, according to their inſtructions from the cruel Raja, drew a large plug from the bottom of the canoe; and throwing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the river, were taken up by another canoe which had followed them for that purpoſe. The canoe was inſtantly filled with water. The unfortunate prince and his two friends betook themſelves to ſwimming. They followed the other canoe; but ſhe haſtened to the ſhore. The river was broad; and at laſt, worn out with fatigue, Suja reſigned himſelf to death. His two faithful friends at the ſame inſtant diſappeared in the ſtream.</p>

ſhe attempted to ſtab him with a dagger which ſhe had concealed. She, however, was diſarmed; and perceiving that ſhe was deſtined for the arms of the murderer of her lord, in the madneſs of grief, rage and deſpair, ſhe disfigured her beautiful face with her own hands; and at laſt found with ſad difficulty a cruel death, by daſhing her head againſt a ſtone.

He was bold and intrepid in action, and far from being deſtitute of addreſs. His perſonal courage was great; and he was even a ſtranger to political fear. Had he, at the commencement of the war, been poſſeſſed of troops equal in valour to thoſe of his brother, we might probably have the misfortunes of Aurungzêbe, and not thoſe of Suja, to relate. But the effeminate natives of Bengal failed him in all his efforts. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal courage in a general, aſſumes the appearance of fear with a cowardly army. When Suja prevailed, the merit was his own; when he failed, it was the fault of his army. No prince was ever more beloved than Suja; he never did a cruel, never an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane action during his life. Misfortune, and even death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, could not deprive him of all his friends; and though his fate was not known in Hindoſtan for ſome years after his death, when it was heard, it filled every eye with tears.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note>THE war with Suja, which was carried on in the extremity of the empire, neither diſturbed the repoſe of Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe, nor diverted his attention from the civil affairs of the ſtate. Impartial and deciſive in his meaſures, he was even acknowledged  to be a good prince, by thoſe who recognized not his right to the throne; and men began to wonder, how he, who was ſo juſt, could be ſo cruel. The people ſuffered little by the civil war. The damage done by the marching and counter-marching of armies, was paid out of the public treaſury. An exact diſcipline had been obſerved by all parties; for the rivals for the crown of Hindoſtan, though in the ſield againſt one another, could not perſuade themſelves that they were in an enemy's country. The prince who prevailed in a province, extended not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0828300200:498"/>
of treaſon to thoſe who ſupported a competitor with their ſwords; and, what is ſcarce credible, not one man beyond the family of Timur, was either aſſaſſinated in private, or ſlain by the hands of public juſtice, during a civil war, ſo long, ſo bloody, and ſo various in its events.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</note>The emperor accuſtomed to buſineſs, in his long government of  various provinces, was well acquainted with the whole detail of public affairs. Nothing was ſo minute as to eſcape his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He knew that the power and conſequence of the prince depended upon the proſperity and happineſs of the people; and he was even from ſelfiſh views an enemy to oppreſſion, and an encourager of agriculture and commercial induſtry. He eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a perfect ſecurity of property over all his dominions. The forms of juſtice were made leſs intricate, and more expeditious than under former reigns. To corrupt a judge was rendered for the firſt time a crime. The fees paid in the courts of judicature were aſcertained with accuracy and preciſion; and a delay in the execution of juſtice, ſubjected the judge to the payment of the loſs ſuſtained by the party aggrieved.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebe.</note>The courſe of appeals from inferior to ſuperior courts was unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and free; but to prevent a wanton exertion of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,  the appellant was ſeverely fined, when his complaint againſt a judgment was found frivolous and ill-founded. The diſtributers of public juſtice, when their decrees were reverſed, could not always ſcreen themſelves under a pretended error in judgment. Should the matter appear clear, they were turned out of their offices, as ſwayed by partiality or bribery. Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe, ſoon after his acceſſion to the throne, eſtabliſhed a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this kind. An appeal came before him in the preſence of the nobles. The deciſion had been unjuſt. He ſent for the judge, and told him in public, <q rend="inline">"This matter is clear and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0828300200:499"/>
if you have no abilities to perceive it in that light, you are unfit for your place, as a weak man; if you ſuffered yourſelf to be overcome by preſents, you are an unjuſt man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unworthy of your office."</q> Having thus reprimanded the judge; he diveſted him of his employment, and diſmiſſed him with ignominy from his preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervations on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note>But this is the fair ſide of the character of Aurungzêbe. Dark  and determined in his policy, he broke through every reſtraint to accompliſh his deſigns. He pointed in a direct line to the goal of ambition; and he cared not by what means he removed whatever object obſtructed his way. He either believed that morality was inconſiſtent with the great tract of government; or, he acted as if he believed it; and he ſometimes deſcended into a vicious meanneſs, which threw diſcredit on his abilities, as well as upon his honeſty. He held the cloke of religion between his actions and the vulgar; and impiouſly thanked the Divinity for a ſucceſs which he owed to his own wickedneſs. When he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and perſecuting his brothers and their families, he was building a magnificent moſque at Delhi, as an offering to God for his aſſiſtance to him in the civil wars. He acted as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt at the conſecration of this temple; and made a practice of attending divine ſervice there, in the humble dreſs of a Fakier. But when he lifted one hand to the Divinity, he, with the other, ſigned warrants for the aſſaſſination of his relations.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Artful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his ſecond ſon.</note>During the civil wars which convulſed the empire, all remained  quiet in the Decan. The prudent management of Mahommed Mauzim, the ſecond ſon of Aurungzêbe, prevented the lately conquered provinces from ſhaking off the yoke. That prince, with a great ſhare of his father's abilities, exceeded him if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in coolneſs and ſelf-denial. He knew the ſtern jealouſy of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0828300200:500"/>
the emperor; and he rather affected the humility of a ſlave, than the manly confidence of a ſon. He was no ſtranger to the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with which his father could ſacrifice every thing to his own ſecurity; and he looked upon him as an enemy who watched his motions, more than in the light of a parent who would grant indulgences for errors. He knew that the beſt means for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the ſuſpicions of Aurungzêbe, was to copy his own art. He affected to love buſineſs; he was humble and ſelf-denied in his profeſſions, deſtitute of preſumption, and full of devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">ſuſpected.</note>Aurungzêbe, whoſe penetrating eye ſaw ſome deſign lurking in ſecret behind the conduct of Mauzim, inſinuated to that prince,  that to reign was a delicate ſituation; that ſovereigns muſt be jealous even of their own ſhadows; and, as for himſelf, he was reſolved never to become a ſacrifice to the ambition of a ſon. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim knew the intention of the ſpeech, but he ſeemed not to underſtand it; and he redoubled his attention to thoſe arts which had already, in a great meaſure, lulled aſleep the watchful ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of his father. He remitted the revenue to the capital, with great regularity and preciſion. He practiſed, in his expences, the oeconomy and frugality which his father loved. In appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and even perhaps from conſtitution, an enemy to effeminate pleaſures, without vanity enough for pomp and magnificence, his court ſeemed like the cell of a hermit, who grudged to others the indulgences for which he had no taſte himſelf. All this art, however, prevailed not with Aurungzébe to continue him in his viceroyſhip of the Decan. He knew, from his own experience, how dangerous it is to continue the government of a rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, long in the hands of a prince of abilities. He, therefore, recalled Mauzim to court, and gave his high office to Shaiſta Chan.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Expedient againſt Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mân.</note>The attention of Aurungzêbe turned from Bengal to another quarter, upon receiving certain intelligence of the flight of Suja to Arracân. Solimân ſtill remained incloſed in the mountains of  Serinagur, under the protection of the Raja. The emperor did not think himſelf firmly fixed on the throne, whilſt any of the family of Dara remained out of his hands. He applied through Joy Singh, who, from being of the ſame religion with the Raja, had great influence over him, to the prince of Serinagur. He tempted his avarice, and he wrought upon his fears. The Raja, being averſe to be thought diſhonourable, heſitated contrary to the bias of his paſſions. He, however, connived at an invaſion of his country to reconcile his people, by an appearance of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to the delivering up of the prince. The troops, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his country with pretended hoſtilities, carried to him the price ſet upon the head of Solimân.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Seized,</note>The unfortunate youth, being apprized of his danger, fled over the frightful mountains which ſeparate Serinagur from  Tibet. Three friends accompanied him in this impracticable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. The ſides of theſe mountains are covered with impervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foreſts, the haunts of beaſts of prey; on their top dwells a perpetual ſtorm. Rapid rivers and impaſſable torrents occupy the vallies; except where ſome bruſhwood here and there hides dangerous and venomous ſnakes. It was then the rainy ſeaſon; and miſt and darkneſs covered the deſart with additional horror. The unhappy fugitives, not daring to truſt any guide, loſt their way. When they thought themſelves on the borders of Tibet, they were again within ſight of Serinagur. Worn out with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, they took ſhelter under a rock, where they were diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſhepherd, who gave them ſome refreſhment, but at the ſame time informed the Raja of what he had ſeen. That chief ſent his ſon with a party to ſeize Solimân. The prince was
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0828300200:502"/>
aſleep when they arrived in fight; but he was rouzed by one of his three friends who kept the watch. They took to their arms. The young Raja plied them with arrows from a diſtance, and two of the prince's companions were ſlain. He himſelf was wounded. He fell under this unequal mode of attack; and was brought bound into the preſence of the Raja.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and ſent to Delhi.</note>That prince began to excuſe his breach of hoſpitality by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic neceſſity. He diminiſhed the independence of his own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,  and magnified the power of Aurungzêbe. <q rend="inline">"To ſeize an unfortunate fugitive," ſaid Solimân, "is a crime; but it is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by the inſult of making an apology, for what Heaven and mankind abhor. Take your reward for my life; it alleviates the misfortunes of my ſituation, that now I owe you nothing for the friendſhip which you exhibited upon my arrival in your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions."</q> He turned his eyes in ſilence to the ground; and, without a murmur, permitted himſelf to be carried priſoner to Delhi. The emperor affected to be diſpleaſed, that the unhappy prince had fallen into his hands. To leave him at large was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; and even the walls of a priſon were not a ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, againſt the deſigns which the diſaffected might form in his favour. He ordered him to be brought into the hall of audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the preſence of all the nobles; even the chief ladies of the haram were indulged with a fight of a young prince, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for his exploits, as for his misfortunes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the emperor.</note>When he had entered the outer-gate of the palace, the chains were ſtruck off from his feet; but the fetters of gold were left  upon his hands. The whole court were ſtruck with the ſtately gracefulneſs of his perſon; they were touched with grief at his melancholy fate. Many of the nobles could not refrain from tears; the ladies of the haram weeped aloud behind the ſcreens.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0828300200:503"/>
Even the heart of Aurungzêbe began to relent; and a placid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety ſeemed to wander over his face. Solimân remained ſilent, with his eyes fixed on the ground. <q rend="inline">"Fear nothing, Solimân Shekô," ſaid the emperor; "I am not cruel, but cautious. Your father fell as a man deſtitute of all religion; but you ſhall be treated well."</q> The prince bowed his head; and then raiſed his hands as high as his fetters would permit, according to the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in the Imperial preſence. He then addreſſed himſelf to the emperor. <q rend="inline">"If my death is neceſſary for the ſafety of Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe, let me preſently die, for I am reconciled to my fate. But let me not linger in priſon, to languiſh away by degrees, by the means of draughts, which deprive the mind of reaſon, when they enfeeble the body."</q> This alluded to an infuſion of poppy, which the impriſoned princes were forced to drink in Gualiâr. It ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated them exceedingly, their ſtrength and underſtanding left them by degrees, they became torpid and inſenſible, till they were at laſt relieved by death. The emperor deſired him to reſt ſatisfied that no deſign was entertained againſt his life. He was ſent that very night to Agra, and ſoon after ordered to Gualiâr, with the prince Mahommed, the emperor's eldeſt ſon.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Embaſſies from Perſia and Tartary.</note>The impriſonment of Solimân put an end to the fears of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe.  He found himſelf firmly ſeated on the throne; and mankind were unwilling to diſturb the tranquillity which they enjoyed under his prudent adminiſtration. Peace prevailed all over the empire. The moſt diſtant and inacceſſible provinces became pervious to his authority. He extinguiſhed party, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining no appearance of revenge againſt thoſe who had oppoſed his elevation. He made friends of his enemies by conferring upon them favours; and he ſecured the faith of his friends by repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them his confidence.

the right which Aurungzêbe had acquired by his fortune and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. An ambaſſador arrived from Shaw Abas the Second of Perſia, to felicitate him on his acceſſion to the throne; and he was followed by another from Suja king of the weſtern Tartary. The emperor's pride was flattered by the acquieſcence of theſe two powerful monarchs, in his title to the crown. He received their repreſentatives with unuſual pomp; and at the ſame time that he gratified the princes with magnificent preſents, he enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ambaſſadors with very conſiderable ſums of money.</p>

That monarch had reſolved to keep him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a cloſe priſoner in Gualiâr: he, however, allowed him a houſehold, and the company of women. This humane treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had raiſed the hopes of the prince of being ſpeedily releaſed. He wrote to his father penitential letters; but they produced no anſwer. Mahommed, in the vigour of his own mind, had a crime which could not be forgiven. Mauzim the ſecond ſon, took advantage of his brother's misfortune. He redoubled his attention to his father's orders; and ſeemed to obey with ſo much humility, that he eradicated all fears of wiſhing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from his ſuſpicious mind. To cut off the hopes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed, as well as to ſecure the affections of Mauzim, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was publicly declared heir of the empire, and his name chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that of Shaw Allum, or, King of the World.

The emperor exerted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a humanity unſuitable to his behaviour toward his own family, to alleviate the diſtreſs of his ſubjects. He remitted the taxes that were due; he employed thoſe already collected in the purchaſe of corn, which was diſtributed among the poorer ſort. He even expended immenſe ſums out of the treaſury, in convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grain by land as well as by water into the interior provinces, from Bengal and the countries which lie on the five branches of the Indus, as having ſuffered leſs on account of the great rivers by which they are watered. The grain ſo conveyed was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, at any price, with the public money; and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold at a very moderate rate. The poorer ſort were ſupplied, at fixed places, with a certain quantity, without any conſideration whatever. The activity of the emperor, and his wiſe regulations, carried relief through every corner of his dominions. Whole provinces were delivered from impending deſtruction; and many millions of lives were ſaved.</p>

Aurungzêbe, from his perfect knowledge of the diſpoſition of the Maraja, was ſatisfied of his guilt.

He ſecretly waited upon many of the nobility, and ſolicited their  intereſt, with large promiſes of gratitude and advantage, in the event of his father's demiſe. Roſhinâra, who was beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the intentions of the emperor, inſinuated, that the ſucceſſion was to fall on Akbâr, as yet but a boy. Both parties averred, however, in public, that at preſent there was no occaſion for a new prince. Aurungzêbe himſelf, they ſaid, only managed the empire during the debility of mind which his illneſs
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0828300200:511"/>
had brought upon Shaw Jehân. That monarch, continued they, being now recovered, will reſume the reins of government; and diſpoſe of the ſucceſſion in favour of any of his poſterity whom he ſhall think worthy of the throne of the Moguls. The people already believed themſelves under the government of the old emperor. The nobility entertained no reſolution of that kind. Their acquieſcence under Aurungzêbe, had rendered them afraid of the reſtoration of his father. They knew that the Maraja and Mohâbet, who ſtill profeſſed themſelves the friends of the latter, would, in the event of his enlargement, carry all before them; and feared the violence of the firſt, as much as they dreaded the abilities of the ſecond.</p>

To open the gates to  Shaw Jehân, was to involve all in confuſion; though it might be expected, that from the attachment of the people to their ancient ſovereign, tumult and commotion would ſoon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. Aurungzêbe, in the ſhort intervals of his exceſſive pain, applied his mind to buſineſs. He gathered the ſenſe of the people from the dark anxiety which covered the features of his attendants. He called his ſon Shaw Allum before him. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to keep himſelf in readineſs in caſe of his death; to ride poſt to Agra, and to take the merit of releaſing Shaw Jehân. <q rend="inline">"Your only hopes of empire, and even the ſafety of your perſon," ſaid he, "will depend upon the gratitude of your grandfather.

The lords quitted the palace, and each began to prepare againſt the worſt events.  He ſent, on the fifth day, a ſummons to all the nobility to come to the hall of audience. He ordered himſelf to be carried into the aſſembly; and he requeſted them, from his bed, to prevent tumults and commotions. <q rend="inline">"A Iion," ſaid he, alluding to his father, "is chained up; and it is not your intereſt to permit him to break looſe. He is exaſperated by real injuries; and he fancies more than he feels."</q> He then called for the great ſeal of the empire, which he had intruſted to the princeſs Roſhinâra. He ordered it to be ſealed up in a ſilken bag, with his private ſignet, and to be placed by his ſide. His exertion to ſpeak to the nobles threw him into a ſwoon. They thought him dead. A murmur flew around. He, however, recovered himſelf; and ordering Joy Singh and ſome of the principal lords to approach, he took them by the hand. Day after day he was thus brought into the preſence of the nobility. All intrigues ceaſed at the hopes of his recovery. On the tenth day of his illneſs, the fever began to leave him, and, on the thirteenth, though weak, he was apparently out of danger. The ſtorm that was gathering, ſubſided at once. A ſerene calm ſucceeded; and people wondered why their minds had been agitated and diſcompoſed, by the hopes and fears of revolution and change.</p>

He ſound that Shaw Allum, whom he had deſigned for his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in the throne, had ſhewn more eagerneſs in forwarding the ſchemes of his own ambition, than anxiety for the recovery of his father. He alſo found, from the reception given to the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the prince by the nobility, that his influence was too inconſiderable to ſecure to him the undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the

He had long thought the ſelf-denial of his ſon to be a cloke for ſome deep-laid deſign; and an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had convinced him of the truth of what he had ſuſpected before. The mother of Shaw Allum was only the daughter of a petty Raja. Aurungzêbe had, on account of her beauty, taken her to wife; but the meanneſs of her birth had left a kind of diſgrace on her ſon in the eyes of the nobles, who revered the high blood of the houſe of Timur. The emperor, therefore, in his youngeſt ſon, found a remedy againſt the objections of the nobility to Shaw Allum. That prince was born to Aurungzêbe by the daughter of Shaw Nawâz, of the Imperial houſe of Sefi. The Perſian nobility, who were numerous in the ſervice of the empire, diſcovered a great attachment to Akbâr; and even the Moguls preferred him on account of the purity of his blood, to his brother. The affections of the emperor were alſo in his favour; and he now ſeriouſly endeavoured to pave his way to the ſucceſſion.</p>

She remained in the priſon at Agra with her grandfather. Aurungzêbe, upon his recovery, wrote a letter, full of profeſſions of regard, to his father; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it with a formal demand of the daughter of Dara, for his ſon Akbâr; hoping, by that connection, to ſecure the influence of the young prince among the nobles. The ſierce ſpirit of Shaw Jehân took fire; Jehanâra's indignation aroſe. They rejected the propoſition with diſdain; and the old emperor returned for anſwer, That the inſolence of Aurungzêbe was equal to his crimes. The young princeſs was, in the mean time, alarmed.

She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed a dagger in her boſom; and declared, that ſhe would ſuffer death a hundred times over, before ſhe would give her hand to the ſon of her father's murderer. Shaw Jehân did not fail to acquaint Aurungzêbe of her reſolution, in her own words; and that prince, with his uſual prudence, deſiſted from his deſign. He even took no notice of the harſhneſs of his father's letter. He wrote to him, ſoon after, for ſome of the Imperial jewels, to adorn his throne. <q rend="inline">"Let him govern with more juſtice," ſaid Shaw Jehân; "for equity and clemency are the only jewels that can adorn a throne.

He knew it to be feigned; but the power of his ſon to inforce his requeſts gave value to his moderation. He accordingly ſent to him a preſent of jewels, with a part of the enſigns of Imperial dignity, to the value of two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds. He accompanied them with a ſhort let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <q rend="inline">"Take theſe, which I am deſtined to wear no more.

                  <note place="margin">Recovery of the emperor.</note>THOUGH Aurungzêbe was judged out of danger on the thirteenth day of his illneſs, his diſorder hung upon him for more than two months. His application to buſineſs was an  enemy to the ſpeedy reſtoration of his health; but the annual rains, which commenced in July, having rendered the air more cool, his fever entirely left him, and he ſoon regained his former ſtrength. His phyſicians adviſed him to avoid, by an expedition to Caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, the heat of the enſuing ſeaſon; and his favourite ſiſter Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinâra, whoſe counſel he generally followed, being very deſirous of viſiting that delightful country, perſuaded him to prepare for his progreſs. The affairs of the empire had become ſettled with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning health. The hopes of novelty had ſubſided in the minds of the people; and the preciſion with which government was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, left room for neither their hopes nor their fears. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0828300200:518"/>
judges of things however blamed the emperor for quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the center of his dominions; whilſt his father remained a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in his own capital. Aurungzêbe judged of the future by the paſt; the nobles were tired of revolution and war, and the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are feldom mutinous or troubleſome, where no glaring op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion exiſts.</p>

The army which accompanied him in this tour, conſiſted of near fifty thouſand men, excluſive of the retinues of his nobles, and the neceſſary followers of the camp. The heavy baggage and artillery kept the common highway, but the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himſelf deviated often into the country, to enjoy the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of hunting. The princeſs Rochinâra, fond of pomp and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, was indulged in her favourite paſſion by the ſplendor of her cavalcade. The emperor, who in a great meaſure owed his ſucceſs to the intelligence which ſhe had from time to time tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him from the haram, ſhewed himſelf grateful. Her jealouſy of the influence of Jehanâra over her father firſt attached her to the intereſts of Aurungzêbe; and the partiality ſhewn by her ſiſter to Dara, naturally threw Rochinâra into the ſcale of his foe. Her abilities rendered her ſit for politics and intrigue; and the warmth of her conſtitution, which ſhe could not conſecrate to pleaſure, adapted her for buſineſs and action.</p>

The petitioners followed the court; and a ſmall allowance from the public treaſury was aſſigned to them, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for their additional expence in attending the Imperial camp. In this manner Aurungzêbe arrived at Caſhmire. The beauty, the cool and ſalubrious air of that country, induced him to relax his mind for a ſhort time from buſineſs. He wandered over that charming valley, after a variety of pleaſures; and he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that vigour of conſtitution which his attention to public buſineſs, as well as his late ſickneſs, had greatly impaired.</p>

Diſturbances broke out in the kingdom of Guzerat. The Rajas of the mountains, thinking the tribute which they paid to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire too high, rebelled. Rai Singh was choſen chief of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. They joined their forces, and, iſſuing from their narrow valleys, preſented a conſiderable army in the open country. Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tub, a general of experience, was ordered againſt them with the troops ſtationed in the adjacent provinces. He arrived before the rebels, and encamped in their preſence. Both armies entrenched themſelves, and watched the motions of each other. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were determined not to fight at a diſadvantage; and they continued to haraſs one another with flying parties, whilſt the main bodies remained in their reſpective camps. Slight ſkirmiſhes happened every day, in which neither ſide arrogated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any great advantage.</p>

Advancing in a cloud, they came unperceived to the intrenchments; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had clambered over the walls before the ſentries gave the alarm. A ſudden tumult and confuſion flew over the camp; and a dreadful ſlaughter commenced. The Moguls had no time either to arm or to form. The horſes broke looſe from their piquets, and ruſhed, in diſorder, over men, and tents, and baggage, and arms. Some who had mounted were thrown headlong with their horſes over the tent-ropes, and other embarraſſments of the camp.</p>

The confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion  and terror of the ſcene intimidated all. They withdrew on both ſides; as they could not diſtinguiſh friends from foes. The night was full of horror. Every heart beat with fear; every tongue joined in the uproar; every eye looked impatiently for day. The light of morning at length appeared; and a ſudden ſhout from both armies gave teſtimony of their joy. Preferring certain danger to evils which they could not diſtinguiſh clearly, each ſide, on the approach of battle, diſcovered that elevation of ſpirit which others derive from victory. The rebels renewed the attack, but the Imperial general, who had improved the ſuſpenſion of battle, was now prepared to receive them. Rai Singh, with a body of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, charged in the front of the Rajaputs, and ſuſtained the whole ſhock of the Moguls. Three hundred perſons of rank, with Rai Singh, the general of the confederates, lay dead on the field; fifteen hundred of their followers were ſlain, the remaining part of the rebels having fled, and left their camp ſtanding to the victors. The Imperial general purſued the fugitives into their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and, in the ſpace of ſix months, he reduced their whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0828300200:521"/>
and, depriving the princes of their hereditary juriſdictions, he ſubjected the people to the authority of temporary governors, who derived their power from Aurungzêbe.</p>

After the total defeat and  flight of Suja, he returned to the capital of his province to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late public affairs, thrown into confuſion by a length of hoſtilities. Aurungzêbe, jealous of the great power and reputation of Jumla, had ſignified to that lord, that his preſence in the capital would be ſoon neceſſary for diſcharging the duties of his high office of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier. He at the ſame time informed him, that he longed much to have an opportunity of expreſſing in perſon the high ſenſe which he entertained of his eminent ſervices. Jumla, who preferred the pomp and activity of the field to the ſedentary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the cloſet, ſignified to the emperor his deſire of continuing in his province; pointing out a ſervice, from which the empire might derive great advantage, and he himſelf conſiderable honour.</p>

                  <note place="margin">the kingdom</note>Aurungzêbe, who was unwilling to diſcover his jealouſy to a man whom he eſteemed as well as feared, acquieſced in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals  of Jumla. He, however, reſolved to point out to that lord an enemy, which might divert him from any deſigns he might have to fortify himſelf in the rich and ſtrong kingdom of Bengal againſt the empire. An army inured to war were devoted to Jumla; and his ambition was not greater than his ability to gratify it in the higheſt line. To the north of Bengal lies the rich province of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſâm, which diſcharges the great river Baramputre into the branch of the Ganges which paſſes by Dacca. The king of Aſſâm, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down this river in his fleet of boats, had, during the civil wars, not only ravaged the lower Bengal, but appropriated to himſelf what part of that country lies between the Ganges at Dacca and the mountains which environ Aſſâm. His power and wealth made
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0828300200:522"/>
him an object of glory as well as of plunder; and Jumla received an Imperial mandate to march againſt him with his army.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of Aſſam.</note>Jumla, having filed off his troops by ſquadrons toward Dacca, joined them at that city; and, embarking them on the Baramputre,  moved up into the country which the king of Aſſâm had long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to depredation. No enemy appeared in the field. They had withdrawn to the fortreſs of Azo, which the king had built on the ſide of the mountains which looks toward Bengal. Jumla in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted the place, and forced the garriſon to ſurrender at diſcretion; then, entering the mountains of Aſſam, defeated the king in a pitched battle, and beſieged him in his capital of Kirganu. The vanquiſhed prince was ſoon obliged to leave the city, with all its wealth, to the mercy of the enemy, and to take refuge, with a few adherents, in the mountains of Laſſa. In many naval conflicts on the river and great lakes, through which it flowed, Jumla came off victorious; and the ſmall forts on the banks fell ſucceſſively into his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Retreat,</note>Thus far ſucceſs attended the arms of Jumla. But the rainy ſeaſon came on with unuſual violence, and covered the valley which  forms the province of Aſſâm, with water. There was no room left for retreating; none for advancing beyond Kirganu. The mountains around were involved in tempeſt, and, beſides, were full of foes. The king, upon the approach of the Imperialiſts, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the grain to the hills; and the cattle were driven away. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, in every form, attacked the army of Jumla. They had wealth, but they were deſtitute of proviſions, and of every thing neceſſary for ſupporting them in the country till the return of the fair ſeaſon. To remain was impoſſible: to retreat almoſt imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable. The king had deſtroyed the roads in the paſſes of the mountains; and he haraſſed the march of the Imperialiſts with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant ſkirmiſhes. Jumla, in the mean time, conducted his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with his wonted abilities and prudence; and carried back
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0828300200:523"/>
his army, covered with glory, and loaded with wealth, into the territory near the entrance of the mountains from Bengal.</p>

                  <note place="margin">death,</note>Expreſſes carried the news of the ſucceſs of Jumla to the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.  He acquainted Aurungzêbe that he had opened a paſſage, which, in another ſeaſon, might lead his arms to the borders of China. Elated with this proſpect of extending his conqueſts, he began to levy forces, and diſpatched orders to Jumla to be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for the field by the return of the ſeaſon. But the death of that general put an end to this wild deſign. Upon his arrival at Azo, a dreadful ſickneſs prevailed in the army, and he himſelf fell a victim to the epidemic malady which carried off his troops. Though the death of Jumla relieved the emperor of ſome of his political fears, he was affected by an event which he neither expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor wiſhed. He owed much to the friendſhip of that great man; he admired his abilities and renown in arms.</p>

Prudent, penetrating, and brave, he excelled all the commanders of his age and country in conduct, in ſagacity, and in ſpirit. During a war of ten years, when he commanded the army of the king of Tillingâna, he reduced the Carnatic and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring countries, with all their forts; ſome of which are ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable againſt all the diſcipline of Europeans. He was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the intrigues of the cabinet, as well as for the ſtratagems of the field. He was wiſe in planning; bold in execution; maſter of his mind in action, though elevated with all the fire of valour. In his private life he was amiable and humane; in his public tranſactions dignified and juſt. He diſdained to uſe unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous means againſt his enemies; and he even expreſſed his joy upon the eſcape of Suja from his arms. He was, upon the whole,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0828300200:524"/>
equal in abilities to Aurungzêbe, with no part of the duplicity which ſtampt ſome of the actions of that prince with meanneſs. Jumla, to his death, retained the name of Viſier, though the duties of the office were diſcharged by Raja Ragnatta, who did not long ſurvive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Inſurrection</note>The ſecurity which Aurungzêbe acquired by the defeat of ſo many formidable rivals, was diſturbed from a quarter which add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed  ridicule to danger. In the territory of the prince of Marwâr, near the city of Nagur, there lived an old woman, who was arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the eightieth year of her age. She poſſeſſed a conſiderable hereditary eſtate, and had accumulated, by penury, a great ſum of money. Being ſeized with a fit of enthuſiaſm, ſhe became all of a ſudden prodigal of her wealth. Fakiers and ſturdy beggars, under a pretence of religion, to the number of five thouſand, gathered round her caſtle, and received her bounty. Theſe vagabonds, not ſatisfied with what the old woman beſtowed in charity, armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and, making predatory excurſions into the country, returned with ſpoil to the houſe of their patroneſs, where they mixed intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and riot with devotion. The people, oppreſſed by theſe ſanctified robbers, roſe upon them, but they were defeated with great ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>Repeated diſaſters of the ſame kind were at laſt attributed to the power of enchantment. This ridiculous opinion gaining ground, fear became predominant in the opponents of the Fakiers. The banditti, acquiring confidence from their ſucceſs, burnt and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the country for many leagues; and ſurrounded the caſtle of the pretended enchantreſs with a deſart. The Raja marched againſt them with his native troops, but was defeated; the collectors of the Imperial revenue attacked them, but they were forced to give way. A report prevailed, and was cagerly believed by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that on a certain day of the moon, the old lady uſed to cook
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0828300200:525"/>
in the ſkull of an enemy, a meſs compoſed of owls, bats, ſnakes, lizards, human fleſh, and other horrid ingredients, which ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to her followers. This abominable meal, it was believed by the rabble, had the ſurpriſing effect of not only rendering them void of all fear themſelves, and of inſpiring their enemies with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but even of making them inviſible in the hour of battle, when they dealt their deadly blows around.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Fakiers</note>Their numbers being now encreaſed to twenty thouſand, this motley army, with an old woman at their head, directed their  march toward the capital. Biſtamia, for that was her name, was a commander full of cruelty. She covered her rout with murder and devaſtation, and hid her rear in the ſmoke of burning villages and towns. Having advanced to Narnoul, about five days journey from Agra, the collector of the revenue in that place oppoſed her with a force, and was totally defeated. The affair was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerious, and commanded the attention of the emperor. He found that the minds of the ſoldiers were tainted with the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the people, and he thought it neceſſary to combat Biſtamia with weapons like her own. Sujait was ordered againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. The emperor, in the preſence of the army, delivered to that general, billets written with his own hand, which were ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain magical incantations. His reputation for ſanctity was at leaſt equal to that of Biſtamia; and he ordered a billet to be carried on the point of a ſpear before each ſquadron, which the ſoldiers were made to believe would counteract the enchantments of the enemy. The credulity which induced them to dread the witchcraft of the old woman, gave them confidence in the pretended charm of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe.</p>

In the midſt of their intemperate joy, Sujait made his appearance. They fought with the fury of fanatics; but when the idea of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural aid was diſpelled from the minds of the Imperialiſts, the Fakiers were not a match for their ſwords. It was not a battle, but a confuſed carnage: a few owed their lives to the mercy of Sujait, the reſt met the death which they deſerved. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe, when he received Sujait, after his victory, could not help ſmiling at the ridicule thrown upon his arms, by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of an old woman at the head of a naked army of mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. <q rend="inline">"I ſind," ſaid he, "that too much religion among the vulgar, is as dangerous as too little in a monarch."</q> The emperor, upon this occaſion, acted the part of a great prince, who turns the paſſions and ſuperſtitions of mankind, to the accompliſhment of his own deſigns.

Mahommed, though violent in the nobler paſſions of the human mind, was in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate character generous, friendly and humane. He loved battle for its dangers; he deſpiſed glory which was not purchaſed with peril. He was even diſappointed when an enemy fled; and was heard to ſay, That to purſue fugitives was only the buſineſs of a coward. But he was unfit for the cabinet; and rather a good partizan, than a great general in the field. He had boldneſs to execute any undertaking, but he wanted prudence to plan.

But as for me, I will not wound him with my preſence; leſt rage might haſten death before his time."</q> The prince rode poſt to Agra; but Shaw Jehân had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired two days before his arrival. His body was depoſited in the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtâza Zemâni, with funeral ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities rather decent than magnificent. When the news of the death of his father was carried to Aurungzêbe, he exhibited all the ſymptoms of unaffected grief. He inſtantly ſet off for Agra; and, when he arrived in that city, he ſent a meſſage to the princeſs Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanâra to requeſt the favour of being admitted into her preſence. The requeſts of an emperor are commands. She had already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for an interview; and ſhe received him with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt magnificence, preſenting him with a large golden baſon, in which were contained all the jewels of Shaw Jehân. This mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent offering, together with the polite dexterity of the princeſs in excuſing her own former conduct, wrought ſo much on Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe, that he received her into his confidence; which ſhe ever after ſhared in common with her ſiſter Rochinâra.</p>

The affairs of the province ſtood in need of his preſence. The death of Jumla had encouraged the prince of Arracân to invade the eaſtern diviſion of Bengal.

The complaints of the oppreſſed province were carried to the throne; and Shaiſta was not only commiſſioned to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the pirates, but even to penetrate with his arms into Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racân. A generous regret for Suja joined iſſue with an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the public benefit, in the mind of Aurungzêbe.

The Mogul however, in the ſpace of a few weeks, reduced Sindiep, and took part of the fleet of Arracân. Haſſen's force being too ſmall to act upon the continent with any proſpect of ſucceſs, Shaiſta had, by this time, aſſembled ten thouſand horſe and foot at Dac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, with the command of which he inveſted his ſon Ameid Chan.

The troops of Arracân made a ſhew of oppoſition; but they ſled to the capital of the province, which was about fifty miles diſtant. They ſhut themſelves up in the fort.

The Perſians, who with a  prepoſterous negligence, had remained quiet during the civil diſſentions in India, ſhewed a diſpoſition to attack Aurungzêbe, after his fortune and conduct had firmly eſtabliſhed him on the throne. But various reaſons had induced Shaw Abâs the Second, who, with no mean abilities, held then the ſeepter of Perſia, to avoid coming to extremities with the houſe of Timur, when all its branches were in arms. The unſucceſsful expeditions againſt the unconquered tribes along the Indian ocean, had drained his treaſury; and Mohâbet, who remained in a ſtate of neutrality in the

He ſeemed more anxious to preſerve his dignity at home, than to purchaſe fame by his arms aborad; and, had not his pride been wounded by an accident, more than from any deſign, on the ſide of Aurungzêbe, that monarch might have enjoyed in tranquillity an empire which he had acquired by blood.</p>

To return the compliment to Shaw Abâs, Tirbiet Chan, a man of high dignity, was ſent ambaſſador from the court of Delhi to Iſpahan. He was received with the ceremony and reſpect which was due to the repreſentative of ſo great a prince as the emperor of Hindoſtan. His credentials were read, in the hall of audience, in the preſence of the nobility; and the few preſens, which the ſuddenneſs of his departure from his court had permitted him to bring along with him to Abâs, were accepted with condeſcenſion and expreſſions of ſatisfaction.

Some preſents had been, at the ſame time, ordered to be prepared for the prince of the Uſbecs, whom it was cuſtomary to addreſs only by the title of Wali, or Maſter of the Weſtern Tartary. The ſame clerk in the office made out

the inventory of the preſents for both the princes; and, at the head of the liſt for Perſia, he called Shaw Abâs, Wali, or Maſter of Iran. The inventory, accompanied by a letter to the emperor, was ſent with the preſents to Tirbiet; and he, without examining either, demanded an audience of Abâs, and placed both in his hands as he ſat upon his throne. Abâs, though otherwiſe an excellent prince, was much addicted to wine. He was intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated when he received Tirbiet; and with an impatience to know the particulars of the preſents, he threw firſt his eyes on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory. When he read the Wali, or Maſter of Perſia, he ſtarted, in a rage, from his throne, and drew his dagger from his ſide. The nobles ſhrunk back on either ſide, and Tirbiet, who ſtood on the ſteps which led up to the Imperial canopy, retreated from the wrath of Abâs. The emperor, ſtill continuing ſilent, ſat down.

Aurungzêbe, upon receiving the letters of Tirbiet, wrote an immediate anſwer to that lord. He laid the the whole blame on the inadvertence and ignorance of a clerk in office; declaring, in the moſt ſolemn manner, that he never meant an affront to the illuſtrious houſe of Sefi. <q rend="inline">"The title of Allum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire," ſaid he, "is adopted from an ancient cuſtom, preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent among the poſterity of Timur.

That prince, when he had firſt received the letters of Tirbiet, called his ſon Shaw Allum, with twenty thouſand horſe, from the Decan. He ordered him immediately to the frontiers, to watch the motions of Perſia. Abâs, in the mean time, having collected his army, to the number of eighty thouſand, with an immenſe train of artillery, advanced, at their head, into Choraſſan. Shaw Allum was reinforced by all the troops of the northern provinces. He, however, received ſtrict orders from his father, not to riſque the iſſue of a general action; but to haraſs the enemy in his march. He himſelf made preparations to take the field.

The Tartars arming themſelves with the weapons of the dead, iſſued forth, diſperſed themſelves in the crowd, and, notwithſtanding all the vigilance, activity, and promiſes of Aurungzêbe, they were never heard of more.

The Perſians were numerous and warlike; the emperor implacable and dark. The eyes and

Ideal ſounds were taken for the ſignal of death; and the timorous ſeemed to hug themſelves in the viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ſecurity of their houſes.

He  was alike fearful of granting pardon and of inflicting puniſhment. There was danger on both ſides; and his invention, fertile as it was in expedients, could point out no reſource. He endeavoured, by promiſes and fair pretences, to get the principals into his hands. But they had taken the alarm, and no one would truſt himſelf to the clemency of an enraged deſpot. Upon the firſt intelligence of the conſpiracy, the emperor wrote to his ſiſter Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanâra, who reſided at Agra, to come with all expedition to Delhi. The Perſian nobles, he knew, had been attached to Shaw Jehân, to whoſe favour they had owed their promotion in the empire; and he hoped that they would liſten to the advice of the favourite daughter of the prince whom they loved. He himſelf remained, in the mean time, ſullen and dark: he ſpoke to none, his whole ſoul being involved in thought.</p>

They repreſented to him, that it would be both unjuſt and impolitic to ſacriſice the lives of ſo many great men to bare ſuſpicion; for that no proofs of their guilt had hitherto appeared, but from the hands of an enemy, who might

have deviſed this method to ſow diviſion and diſſention in a country which he propoſed to invade. That the Perſian nobles had become powerful in the ſtate from their high military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, their great wealth, the immenſe number of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; that the common danger had united them; that the attack upon them would not prove a maſſacre but a civil war. That the Patan nobility, warlike, numerous, diſaffected, ſtill hankering after their ancient domination of which they had been deprived by the folly of their princes, as much as by the valour of the Moguls, would not fail to throw their weight into the ſcale of the Perſians; and, upon the whole, they were of opinion, that peaceable meaſures ſhould be adopted toward domeſtic traitors, at leaſt till the danger of foreign war ſhould be removed.</p>

He declared himſelf for lenient meaſures; but how to effect a reconciliation, with honour to himſelf, was a matter of difficulty. The princeſs Jehanâra arrived, in the mean time, from Agra. She had travelled from that city to Delhi, on an elephant, in leſs than two days, though the diſtance is two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles. Her brother received her with joy. After a ſhort conference, ſhe preſented herſelf, in her chair, at the door of the viſier's houſe. The gates were immediately thrown open; and ſhe was uſhered into the apartments of the women. The viſit was a mark of ſuch confidence, and ſo great an honour in the eyes of the viſier, that, leaving the princeſs to be entertained by the ladies, he haſtened, without even ſeeing her himſelf, or waiting for her requeſt to the emperor. When he entered the hall of audience, he proſtrated himſelf before the throne. Aurungzêbe deſcended, took him in his arms, and embraced him in the moſt friendly manner. He then put the letter, which was the cauſe of the diſturbance, in the viſier's hand.</p>

He gave it back, and poſitively  denied his ever having given the leaſt reaſon to Shaw Abâs for addreſſing him in that manner. He expatiated on his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; upon thoſe of his anceſtors, who had reſided in Hindoſtan ever ſince the time of the emperor Humaioon. He repreſented the improbability of his entertaining any deſigns againſt a prince, who had raiſed him to the firſt rank among his ſubjects, and had left him nothing to hope or to wiſh for, but the continuance of his favour and the ſtability of his throne. He concluded with a pertinent queſtion: <q rend="inline">"What could I expect in Perſia equal to the high office of viſier in Hindoſtan? Let my common ſenſe be an argument of my innocence; and let not the emperor, by an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my guilt, declare to the world that I am deprived of reaſon."</q>

By way of doing him honour, he ordered him to be clothed with a magnificent dreſs; at the ſame time directing him to command all the Perſian nobles to make their immediate appearance in the hall of audience. When they were all aſſembled, the emperor mounted the throne; and, after they had paid the uſual compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he addreſſed them in a long ſpeech. He excuſed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings by reading the letter of Abâs; and he reproved them gently for their contumacy in not obeying his orders. He argued, that the power of a monarch ceaſes when his commands are diſputed; and, that the indignity thrown upon him by their diſobedience, touched him more than their ſuppoſed treaſon. <q rend="inline">"But," continued he, "a prince, though the repreſentative of God, is liable to error and deception.

That lord, haughty and daring in his diſpoſition, was diſſatisfied with the conduct of the viſier, hurt at the ſubmiſſion of his countrymen, and piqued at the emperor's latter words. He looked ſternly upon Aurungzêbe; and ſaid, in a ſcornful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <q rend="inline">"Since you have been pleaſed to pardon us for offences which we did not commit; we can do no leſs than forget the errors which you have made."</q> The emperor, pretending that he did not hear Amîn diſtinctly, ordered him to repeat his words; which he did twice, in a haughty and high tone of voice. The eyes of Aurungzêbe kindled with rage. He ſeized a ſword, which lay by his ſide on the throne. He looked around to ſee, whether any of the nobles prepared to reſent the affront offered to his dignity. They ſtood in ſilent aſtoniſhment. He ſat down; and his fury beginning to abate, he talked to the viſier about the beſt manner of carrying on the Perſian war.</p>

The army  had already aſſembled in the neighbourhood of Delhi; and the Imperial tents were pitched on the road toward the north. He marched in a few days at the head of a great force; but the ſtorm which he feared, diſſipated without falling. When he was within a few miles of Lahore, expreſſes arrived from his ſon, who
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0828300200:548"/>
commanded the army of obſervation on the frontiers of Perſia, with intelligence that Shaw Abâs, who had languiſhed for ſome time under a neglected diſeaſe, expired in his camp on the twenty-fifth of September. This accident, of which a more ambitious monarch than Aurungzêbe might have taken advantage, ſerved only to change the reſolutions of that prince from war. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that nature ſeemed to have deſigned the two countries for ſeparate empires, from the immenſe ridge of mountains which divide them from one another, by an almoſt impaſſable line.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Death and character of Shaw Abâs.</note>Shaw Abâs was a prince of abilities, and when rouzed, fond of expedition and delighting in war. He was juſt in his deciſions, mild in his temper, and affable in his converſation. Deſtitute of prejudices  of every kind, he made no diſtinction of countries, none of ſyſtems of religion. He encouraged men of worth of every nation; they had acceſs to his perſon, he heard and redreſſed their grievances, and rewarded their merit. He was, however, jealous of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and he was determined to be obeyed. He could forgive the guilty, upon being convinced of their contrition; but an inſult on his dignity he would never forgive. His paſſions were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſtrong; he broke often forth like a flaſh of lightning; but when he was moſt agitated, a calm was near; and he ſeemed to be aſhamed of the trifles which ruffled his temper. He loved juſtice for its own ſake; and through his exceſſes in wine gave birth ſometimes to folly, they never gave riſe to an act of injuſtice. He was fond of the company of women; and his love of variety produced the diſtemper of which he died.</p>

That his own empire was ample; and that all he wanted was to defend it from inſult and invaſion. That the diſreſpectful words of Abâs vaniſhed with his life; for, conſcious of his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and power, that he neither feared the abuſe, nor dreaded the arms of any prince. He condoled with the family of Sheick Sefi, for the loſs of a monarch, whoſe moſt exceptionable action was his unprovoked attempt upon India. Aurungzêbe, however, left a powerful army on his frontiers. The Perſians might be induced to derive advantage from the immenſe preparations which they had made; and he reſolved to truſt nothing to their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The prince Shaw Allum was, in the mean time, recalled to Delhi. The emperor, full of circumſpection and caution in all his actions, was reſolved to remove temptation from his ſon. He feared that an army unemployed in a foreign war, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into an inſtrument of ambition at home. Shaw Allum copied his father's moderation and ſelf-denial upon every occaſion, and he, therefore, was not to be truſted.</p>

Dilêre Chan, by orders from the court of Delhi, led an army againſt the refractory tributary. He laid waſte the country, and beſieged the prince in his capital. Adil Shaw was ſoon reduced to extremities for want of proviſions; and he was upon the point of ſurrendering himſelf at diſeretion, when orders arrived from the emperor, in the camp of Dilêre, to break up the ſiege, and to return immediately with the army to Delhi. Theſe unſeaſonable orders proceeded from the jealouſy of Shaw Allum. He knew that Dilêre was in the intereſt of his younger brother; and he was afraid that a conqueſt of ſuch ſplendor would give him too much weight in the empire. He had inſinuated,

His father's orders were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his wiſhes. He had received inſtructions from court to ſeize the perſon of the ſuſpected lord, ſhould he ſhew any marks of diſaffection; or to ſubdue him by force of arms, ſhould he appear refractory. Thus far the deſigns of Shaw Allum ſucceeded. Dilêre, apprized of the prince's ſchemes, broke up the ſiege, though with regret, as the place was on the point of ſurrendering. He moved toward Delhi, with a diſappointed army of thirty thouſand Patan horſe, and the like number of infantry.</p>

Dilêre ſent a meſſenger to Shaw Allum, excuſing himſelf for not waiting upon him in perſon that evening; but he promiſed to preſent himſelf in the tent of audience by the dawn of next morning. The prince called a council of his principal officers, who had already ſworn on the Coran to ſupport him with their lives and fortunes. The Maraja, who was never happy but when he was hatching miſchief againſt Aurungzêbe, was preſent. This prince propoſed, that when Dilêre came into the preſence, they ſhould lay open to him their whole deſign againſt the emperor; that in caſe of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing refractory, he ſhould inſtantly be diſpatched as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemy. Though Shaw Allum did not altogether approve of the Maraja's violence, he conſented that Dilêre ſhould be

He ſtruck his tents in the night, and, marching on ſilently, took a circuit round the other ſide of the city, and when morning appeared, he was heard of above thirty miles from Aurungabâd, on the road to Delhi. The prince, being informed of the flight of Dilêre, was violently tranſported with rage. He marched ſuddenly in purſuit of the fugitive; but he was ſo much retarded by his numbers, which, including the followers of the camp, amounted to two hundred thouſand men, that in a few days, he found that Dilêre had outſtripped him above fifty miles. He ſelected a part of his army, and leaving the heavy baggage behind, continued the purſuit with great vivacity. His officers did not, however, ſecond the warmth of the prince.

Aurungzêbe ſeemed ſatisfied with this excuſe. His ſon was formidable, and he reſolved by degrees to diveſt him of his dangerous power. A rebellion was thus begun and ended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding blood. The art of the father was conſpicuous in the ſon. They looked upon one another with jealouſy and fear; and it was remarkable, that when both were in the field, and ready to engage, they had carried their politeneſs ſo far as not to utter, on either ſide, a ſingle word of reproach.

That lord  had rendered eminent ſervices to the empire. In his march to the Decan againſt Adil Shaw, he had reduced ſome refractory Rajas in the mountains, who having joined in a confederacy, reſuſed to pay their tribute. He deviated from his rout into the country of Bundela, and attacked, in his territory, the Raja of Hoda. The ſpoils of the enemy made ample amends for the tribute which had been with-held.

The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan tribe of Euſoph Zehi, who poſſeſs the heads of the Attoc and the Nilâb, ruſhed down from their mountains like a torrent, with thirty thouſand men. They ſpread terror and devaſtation over all the plains of Punjâb; having inveſted their chief with the enſigns of royalty under the name of Mahommed Shaw. This prince, in the manifeſtoes which he diſperſed in his march, averred his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from Alexander the Great, and a daughter of the king of Tranſoxiana. This genealogy was probably fabulous; but the Afgans have high claims on antiquity. A literary people, like the Arabs, and, by their mountains, their poverty, and the peculiar ferocity of their manners, ſecured from conqueſt, they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among them many records of ancient authority, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted credit.</p>

                  <note place="margin">of the Afgans</note>Mahommed Shaw's power of doing miſchief was leſs problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical  than his high deſcent. The news of his ruinous progreſs was carried to Aurungzêbe. He ordered the governor of the adjoining diſtricts to haraſs the enemy till troops ſhould march to his aid. The name of this officer was Camil. Impatient of the inſults of the enemy, he reſolved to attack them with ten thouſand Geikers, whom he had collected from their hills round his ſtandard. He directed his march toward the ferry of Haran on the Nilâb, with a determined reſolution to give battle to the rebels. The Afgans, equally deſirous of engaging, croſſed the river with ten thouſand of their beſt troops, and advanced impetuouſly againſt Camil. Morâd, who commanded the van of the Imperial militia, ſell in,

ſword in hand, with the enemy before they had formed. They were thrown into confuſion; but they obſtinately kept their ground, and began to ſurround Morâd. Camil, in the mean time, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the main body. The battle became obſtinate and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Mahommed behaved with a ſpirit worthy of his new digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The reſt of his army haſtened to his relief; but before their arrival he was defeated, and he involved the whole in his own flight. The Nilâb, unfortunately for the fugitives, was four miles in their rear. They were purſued by Camil to the banks. They plunged into the river. More were drowned than fell by the ſword. The reſt were diſſipated; and the inſurrection ſeemed to be entirely quaſhed.</p>
               <p>Camil, after this ſignal victory, entered the country of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels with his army.

They collected an army at the heads of their valleys, and marched down upon the Imperialiſts. Their troops were now more numerous than before, but not leſs unfortunate. They fell in, upon their march, with Shumſhir, whoſe army had been augmented to fifteen thouſand. The battle was obſtinate; and the Afgans derived their own defeat from their impetuous valour. Strangers to regularity and command, they ruſhed, without any form, into the heart of the enemy, and being ſingly overcome, all at laſt took to flight.

They marched up, through the principal valley, and were met by a third army of Afgans. The rebels, averſe to the delays of war, offered battle upon their firſt appearance before the Imperialiſts. The action was bloody. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed Shaw, the pretended deſcendant of Alexander, behaved with a bravery not unworthy of his anceſtor. He led his mountaineers repeatedly to the charge. Fired with the gallant behaviour of their prince, they were not to be driven from the field. The Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, having ſuffered much, were upon the point of giving way, when a report that the prince was ſlain induced the common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers among the rebels to fly.

Amîn, in the mean time arriving, purſued the fugitives through all their almoſt inacceſſible vallies; and levelled every thing with the ground but the rocks, into which a few unfortunate Afgans found a refuge from the ſwords of the victors.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A general peace.</note>A general peace was now eſtabliſhed over all the empire. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe,  to whom buſineſs was amuſement, employed himſelf in making ſalutary regulations for the benefit of his ſubjects. He loved money, becauſe it was the foundation of power; and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged induſtry and commerce, as they encreaſed his revenue. He himſelf, in the mean time, led the life of a hermit, in the midſt of a court, unequalled in its ſplendour. The pomp of ſtate, he found, from experience, was not neceſſary to eſtabliſh the power of a prince of abilities, and he avoided its trouble, as he liked not its vanity. He however encouraged magnificence among his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers at court, and his deputies in the provinces. The ample al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0828300200:556"/>
granted to them from the revenue, was not, they were made to underſtand, to be hoarded up for their private uſe. <q rend="inline">"The money is the property of the empire," ſaid Aurungzêbe; "and it muſt be employed in giving weight to thoſe who execute its laws."</q>

                  <note place="margin">Magnificent reception of the king of Bucharia.</note>An opportunity offered itſelf to his magnificence and generoſity in  the beginning of the eleventh year of his reign. Abdalla, king of the Leſſer Bucharia, lineally deſcended from the great Zingis, having abdicated the throne to his ſon Alîris, advanced into Tibet in his way to Mecca. He ſent a meſſage to Aurungzêbe, requeſting a permiſſion for himſelf and his retinue to paſs through India. The emperor ordered the governor of Caſhmire to receive the royal pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim with all imaginable pomp, and to ſupply him with every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of luxury and convenience at the public expence. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of diſtricts were commanded to attend Abdalla from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to province, with all their followers. The troops, in every place through which he was to paſs, were directed to pay him all military honours; and, in this manner, he advanced to Delhi, and was received by the emperor at the gates of the city. Having remained ſeven months in the capital, he was conducted with the ſame pomp and magnificence to Surât, where he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for Arabia.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſervations.</note>THOUGH Hiſtory loſes half her dignity in deſcending to  unimportant particulars, when ſhe brings information, ſhe cannot fail, even in her moſt negligent dreſs, to pleaſe. The ſingular good fortune and abilities of Aurungzêbe ſtamp a kind of conſequence on every circumſtance, which contributed to raiſe him to a throne, which his merit deſerved to poſſeſs without a crime. The line of his public conduct, in riſing to the ſummit of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has already been followed with ſome preciſion; but his private life, which prepared him for the greatneſs at which he had now arrived, remains ſtill in the ſhade. To bring forward the objects which have hitherto lain diſtant and dim behind, will heighten the features of the picture, and perhaps recommend it to thoſe who wiſh to ſee the glare of great tranſactions tempered with anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note>The education of the natives of Aſia is confined; that of young  men of diſtinction always private. They are ſhut up in the haram from infancy till their ſeventh or eighth year; or, if they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come abroad, it is only under the care of eunuchs, a race of men more effeminate than the women whom they guard. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, therefore, imbibe in early youth little female cunning and diſſimulation, with a tincture of all thoſe inferior paſſions and prejudices which are improper for public life. The indolence na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to the climate, is encouraged by example. They loll whole days on ſilken ſophas; they learn to make noſegays of falſe flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with taſte, to bathe in roſe-water, to anoint themſelves with perſumes, whilſt the nobler faculties of the ſoul loſe their vigour, through want of cultivation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of eaſtern princes.</note>Princes are permitted, at ten years of age, to appear in the hall  of audience. A tutor attends them, who impoſes upon them no reſtraint. They receive little benefit from his inſtructions, and they advance frequently into life without having their minds em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with any conſiderable knowledge of letters. They are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to ſome beautiful woman at twelve, and it cannot be ſuppoſed that a boy, in poſſeſſion of ſuch an enchanting play-thing as a young wife, will give much attention to the dry ſtudy of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. The abilities of the princes of the houſe of Timur, it muſt be confeſſed, extricated, when they advanced in life, their minds from the effects of this ruinous mode of paſſing youth. The moſt of them were men of letters, and given to inquiry; but their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the education of their children, could not altogether ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede the inherent prejudices of their country.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Early genius of Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebe.</note>Shaw Jehân was extremely anxious in training up his ſons in all the literature and knowledge of the Eaſt. He delivered each of  them into the hands of men of virtue as well as of letters; he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0828300200:559"/>
the tutors to dignities in the ſtate, to impreſs awe upon their pupils, and to induce them to liſten to their precepts. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rungzêbe, however, was not fortunate in his maſter. His genius flew before the abilities of the teacher; and the latter, to cover his own ignorance, employed the active mind of the prince in difficult and unprofitable ſtudies. Being naturally remarkably ſerious, he gave up his whole time to application. The common amuſements of children gave him no pleaſure. He was frequently known, whilſt yet he was very young, to retire from the puerile buffoonery of his attendants, to the dry and difficult ſtudy of the Perſian and Arabic languages. His aſſiduity prevailed over the dulneſs of his tutor, and he made a progreſs far beyond his years.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His attention to juſtice;</note>Time had eſtabliſhed into an almoſt indiſpenſible duty, that the  emperor, with his aſſeſſors, the principal judges, was to ſit for two hours every day in the hall of juſtice, to hear and decide cauſes. Shaw Jehân, who took great delight in promoting juſtice, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeded the uſual time. Aurungzêbe, while yet but twelve years of age, ſtood conſtantly near the throne; and he made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, with uncommon ſagacity, upon the merits of the cauſes which were agitated before his father. The emperor ſeemed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed at abilities which afterwards ruined his own power. He often aſked the opinion of his ſon, for amuſement, upon points of equity, and he frequently pronounced ſentence in the very terms of Aurungzêbe's deciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">contempt of pomp and flattery.</note>When he was, in his early youth, appointed to the government  of a province, he was obliged, by his office, to imitate, though in miniature; the mode of the court. He had his hall of audience, he preſided in his court of juſtice; he repreſented royalty in all its forms, except in its pomp and magnificence, to which the natural auſterity of his manners had rendered him an enemy. He exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0828300200:560"/>
upon every occaſion, an utter averſion to flatterers: he admitted not, into his preſence, men of diſſolute manners. The firſt he thought inſulted his judgment, the latter diſgraced him as the guardian of the morality, as well as of the property, of the people. Muſicians, dancers, and ſingers, he baniſhed from his court, as foes to gravity and virtue. Mimics, actors, and buffoons, he drove from his palace, as an uſeleſs race of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Affects plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in dreſs.</note>His dreſs was always plain and ſimple. He wore, upon feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val  days only, cloth of gold, adorned with jewels. He, however, changed his dreſs twice a-day, being remarkably cleanly in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. When he roſe in the morning, he plunged into the bath, and then retired for a ſhort time to prayers. Religion ſuited the ſerious turn of his mind; and he at laſt became an enthuſiaſt through habit. In his youth he never ſtirred abroad on Friday; and ſhould he happen to be in the field, or on a hunting party, he ſuſpended all buſineſs and diverſions. Zealous for the faith of Mahommed, he rewarded proſelytes with a liberal hand, though he did not chuſe to perſecute thoſe of different perſuaſions in matters of religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and love</note>He carried his auſterity and regard for morality into the throne.  He made ſtrict laws againſt vices of every kind. He was ſevere againſt adultery and fornication; and againſt a certain unnatural crime, he iſſued various edicts. In the adminiſtration of juſtice, he was indefatigable, vigilant, and exact. He ſat almoſt every day in judgment, and he choſe men of virtue, as well as remarkable for their knowledge in the law, for his aſſeſſors. When the cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared intricate, it was left to the examination of the bench of judges, in their common and uſual court. They were to report upon ſuch cauſes as had originated before the throne; and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0828300200:561"/>
after weighing their reaſons with caution, pronounced judgment, and determined the ſuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of juſtice.</note>In the courts of the governors of provinces, and even often on the benches on which his deputies ſat in judgment, he kept ſpies  upon their conduct. Though theſe were known to exiſt, their perſons were not known. The princes, his ſons, as well as the other viceroys, were in conſtant terror; nor durſt they exerciſe the leaſt degree of oppreſſion againſt the ſubject, as every thing found its way to the ears of the emperor. They were turned out of their office upon the leaſt well-founded complaint; and when they appeared in the preſence, the nature of their crime was put in writing into their hands. Stript of their eſtates and honours, they were obliged to appear every day at court, as an example to others; and after being puniſhed for ſome time in this manner, according to the degree of their crime, they were reſtored to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; the moſt guilty were baniſhed for life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency;</note>Capital puniſhments were almoſt totally unknown under Aurung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zêbe.  The adherents of his brothers, who contended with him for the empire, were freely pardoned when they laid down their arms. When they appeared in his preſence, they were received as new ſubjects, not as inveterate rebels. Naturally mild and moderate through policy, he ſeemed to forget that they had not been always his friends. When he appeared in public, he clothed his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with a complacent benignity, which pleaſed all. Thoſe who had trembled at his name, from the ſame of his rigid juſtice, when they ſaw him, found themſelves at eaſe. They could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves, in his preſence, with the greateſt freedom and compoſure. His affability gave to them conſidence; and he ſecured to himſelf their eſteem by the ſtrict impartiality of his deciſions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Knowledge of affairs.</note>His long experience in buſineſs, together with the acuteneſs  and retentiveneſs of his mind, rendered him maſter even of the detail of the affairs of the empire. He remembered the rents, he was thoroughly acquainted with the uſages of every particular diſtrict. He was wont to write down in his pocket-book, every thing that occurred to him through the day. He formed a ſyſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atical knowledge of every thing concerning the revenue, from his notes, to which, upon every neceſſary occaſion, he recurred. The governors of the provinces, and even the collectors in the diſtricts, when he examined either, on the ſtate of ther reſpective departments, were afraid of miſrepreſentation or ignorance. The firſt ruined them for ever; the latter turned them out of their offices.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note>His public buildings partook of the temper of his own mind.  They were rather uſeful than ſplendid. At every ſtage, from Cabul to Aurungabâd, from Guzerat to Bengal, through the city of Agra, he built houſes for the accommodation of travellers. Theſe were maintained at the public expence. They were ſupplied with wood, with utenſils of cookery, with a certain portion of rice and other proviſions. The houſes which his predeceſſors had erected on by-roads, were repaired; bridges were built on the ſmall rivers; and boats furniſhed for paſſing the large.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>In all the principal cities of India, the emperor founded uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities; in every inferior town he erected ſchools. Maſters,  paid from the treaſury, were appointed for the inſtruction of youth. Men of known abilities, honour, and learning, were appointed to examine into the progreſs which the learners made, and to prevent indolence and inattention in the maſters. Many houſes for the reception of the poor and maimed were erected; which were endowed with a revenue from the crown. The emperor, in the mean time, collected all the books which could
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0828300200:563"/>
be found on every ſubject; and, after ordering many copies of each to be made, public libraries were formed, for the convenience of learned men, who had acceſs to them at pleaſure. He wrote often to the learned in every corner of his dominions, with his own hand. He called them to court; and placed them, according to their abilities, in offices in the ſtate; thoſe, who were verſed in the commentaries on the Coran, were raiſed to the dignity of judges, in the different courts of juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Skill and courage in war.</note>Aurungzêbe was as experienced in war, as he was in the arts of  peace. Though his perſonal courage was almoſt unparalleled, he always endeavoured to conquer more by ſtratagem than by force. To ſucceed by art threw honour upon himſelf; to ſubdue by power acquired to others fame. Such was his coolneſs in action, that, at the riſing and ſetting ſun, the times appointed for prayer, he never neglected to attend to that duty, though in the midſt of battle. Devout to exceſs, he never engaged in action without prayer; and for every victory, he ordered a day of thankſgiving, and one of feſtivity and joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Learning.</note>In the art of writing, Aurungzêbe excelled in an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. He wrote many letters with his own hand; he corrected  always the diction of his ſecretaries. He never permitted a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of buſineſs to be diſpatched, without critically examining it himſelf. He was verſed in the Perſian and Arabic; he wrote the language of his anceſtors the Moguls, and all the various dialects of India. In his diction he was conciſe and nervous; and he reduced all diſpatches to a brevity and preciſion, which prevented all miſconſtruction and perplexity.</p>

archer, he threw the lance with grace; and he was ſo good a horſeman, that few men durſt follow him in the chace. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the uſe of fire-arms ſo well, that he ſhot deer on full ſpeed from his horſe. When he wandered over the country in purſuit of game, he did not forget the concerns of the ſtate. He examined the nature of the ſoil, he enquired even of common labourers concerning its produce. He underſtood, and, therefore, encouraged agriculture. He iſſued an edict, that the rents ſhould not be raiſed on thoſe who, by their induſtry, had improved their farms. He mentioned, in the edict, that ſuch practice was at once unjuſt and impolitic; that it checked the ſpirit of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and impoveriſhed the ſtate: <q rend="inline">"And what joy," ſaid he, "can Aurungzêbe have in poſſeſſing wealth in the midſt of public diſtreſs?"</q>

                  <note place="margin">Chaſtity.</note>Though he entertained many women, according to the cuſtom  of his country, it was only for ſtate. He contented himſelf with his lawful wives, and theſe only in ſucceſſion; when one either died or became old. He ſpent very little time in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his women. He roſe every morning at the dawn of day, and went into the bathing-chamber; which communicated with a private chapel, to which he retired for half an hour, to prayers. Returning into his apartments from chapel, he ſpent half an hour in reading ſome book of devotion; and then went into the haram to dreſs. He entered the chamber of juſtice gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally about ſeven o'clock; and there ſat with the judges, read petitions, and decided cauſes till nine. Juſtice was diſpenſed in a ſummary manner; and rewards and puniſhments were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate; the diſputes, which were not clear, having been already weighed by the judges in their own court.</p>

Aurungzêbe ordered always a ſum of money to be placed by his ſide on the bench; and he relieved the neceſſitous with his own hand. Large ſums were in this manner expended every day; and, as the court was open to all, the unfortunate found, invariably, a reſource in the Imperial bounty.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Amuſements.</note>The emperor retired at nine to breakfaſt; and continued for  an hour with his family. He then came forth into a balcony, which faced the great ſquare. He ſat there to review his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, which paſſed before him in gorgeous capariſons. He ſometimes amuſed himſelf with the battles of tygers and leopards, ſometimes with thoſe of gazzelles, elks, and a variety of fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious animals. On particular days, ſquadrons of horſe paſſed in review. The fine horſes of his own ſtables were alſo brought, at times, before him, with all their magnificent trappings, mounted by his grooms, who exhibited various feats of horſemanſhip. The balcony in which he ſat was called THE PLACE OF PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VACY, as it looked from the haram, and the ladies ſaw every thing from behind their ſcreens of gauze.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His mode of receiving</note>An hour being ſpent at this amuſement, the emperor, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally  about eleven o'clock, made his appearance in the great hall of audience. There all the nobles were ranged before the throne, in two lines, according to their dignity. Ambaſſadors, viceroys, commanders of armies, Indian princes, and officers, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from various ſervices, were introduced in the following ſorm: The Meer Hajîb, or the lord in waiting, uſhers each into the preſence. At the diſtance of twenty yards from the throne, the perſon to be preſented is commanded by one of the mace-bearers
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0828300200:566"/>
to bow three times very low; raiſing his hand each time from the ground to his forehead. The mace-bearer, at each bow, calls out aloud, that ſuch a perſon ſalutes the EMPEROR OF THE WORLD. He is then led up, between the two lines of the nobles, to the foot of the ſteps which aſcend to the throne; and there the ſame ceremony is again performed. He then moves ſlowly up along the ſteps, and, if he is a man of high quality, or much in favour, he is permitted to make his offering to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himſelf, who touches one of the gold roupees; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid down, the lord of the privy-purſe receives the whole. The emperor ſometimes ſpeaks to the perſon introduced: when he does not, the perſon retires, keeping his face toward the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and performs the ſame ceremonies at the ſame places as before.</p>

When he  retires from the ſteps of the throne, the emperor gives his commands aloud to clothe him with a rich dreſs, ordering a ſum of money, not exceeding a lack of roupees, to be laid before him. He is, at the ſame time, preſented with two elephants, one male and one female, capariſoned, two horſes with rich furniture, a travelling bed elegantly decorated, a complete dreſs, if once worn by his Imperial majeſty the more honourable, a ſword ſtudded with diamonds, a jewel for the front of his turban.

The emperor ſometimes reviewed them; and, after they had exhibited their feats of military dexterity before him, they were received into pay. The Manſebdârs, or the lower rank of nobility, preſented themſelves in another ſquare; artizans, with their moſt curious inventions, occupied a third, and they were encouraged according to the utility and elegance of their work.

He ſpent an hour at table, and then, in the hot ſeaſon, ſlumbered on a ſopha for half an hour. He generally appeared at four, in the balcony above the great gate of the palace. A mob of all kinds of people aſſembled there before him; ſome to claim his bounty, others to prefer complaints againſt the officers of the crown. He retired at ſix, into the chapel to prayers; and, in half an hour, he entered the Guſſel Châna, into which, at that hour, the members of the cabinet were only admitted. He there took their advice upon all the important and ſecret affairs of government; and from thence orders were iſſued to the various departments of the ſtate.

               <p>THE nature of a government is beſt underſtood from the power which it communicates to its officers. The Author of the preceding Hiſtory has thought proper to ſubjoin to his Work the forms of commiſſions granted by the emperor to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the provinces. They will ſerve to juſtify his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the policy of the Imperial houſe of Timur, who were too jealous of their own authority to commit their power, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, to the hands of their deputies. The Deſpot derived the ſtability of his throne from the opinion which the people formed of his paternal care of their happineſs and proſperity. Wanton oppreſſion is an act of folly, not of true deſpotiſm, which leaves to mankind a few rights, which render them worthy of being commanded.</p>

But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have many proofs of his juſtice, humanity, experience and valour, he muſt conform to the ſcope and meaning of the following directions, nor permit the minuteſt article of them to paſs unobſerved.</p>
               <p>He muſt watch over the ſafety and happineſs of that country, taking particular care that the weak ſhall not be oppreſſed by the ſtrong, nor in any manner diſpoſſeſſed of thoſe tenements which have been long occupied by themſelves and their progenitors.</p>
               <p>He ſhall make the uſages of the country, and the rights of the ſubject his ſtudy, and ſhall be accountable for the revenues to commiſſaries of the royal exchequer, after a deduction of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
