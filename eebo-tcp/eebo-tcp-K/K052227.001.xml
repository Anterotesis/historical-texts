            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HOMER is univerſally allow'd to have had the greateſt Invention of any Writer whatever. The Praiſe of Judgment <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> has juſtly conteſted with him, and others may have their Pretenſions as to particular Excellencies; but his Invention remains yet unrival'd. Nor is it a Wonder if he has ever been acknowledg'd the greateſt of Poets, who moſt excell'd in That which is the very Foundation of Poetry. It is the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that in different degrees diſtinguiſhes all great Genius's: The utmoſt Stretch of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Study, Learning, and Induſtry, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters every thing beſides, can never attain to this. It furniſhes Art with all her Materials, and without it Judgment itſelf can at beſt but <hi>ſteal wiſely:</hi> For Art is only like a prudent Steward that lives on managing the Riches of Nature. Whatever Praiſes may be given to Works of Judgment, there is not even a ſingle Beauty in them but is owing to the Invention: As in the moſt regular Gardens, however Art may carry the greateſt Appearance, there is not
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:4"/>
a Plant or Flower but is the Gift of Nature. The firſt can only reduce the Beauties of the latter into a more obvious Figure, which the common Eye may better take in, and is therefore more entertain'd with. And perhaps the reaſon why moſt Criticks are inclin'd to prefer a judicious and methodical Genius to a great and fruitful one, is, becauſe they find it eaſier for themſelves to purſue their Obſervations through an uniform and bounded Walk of Art, than to comprehend the vaſt and various Extent of Nature.</p>
            <p>Our Author's Work is a wild Paradiſe, where if we cannot ſee all the Beauties ſo diſtinctly as in an order'd Garden, it is only becauſe the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them is infinitely greater. 'Tis like a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Nurſery which contains the Seeds and firſt Productions of every kind, out of which thoſe who follow'd him have but ſelected ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Plants, each according to his Fancy, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate and beautify. If ſome things are too luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant, it is owing to the Richneſs of the Soil; and if others are not arriv'd to Perfection or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, it is only becauſe they are over-run and oppreſt by thoſe of a ſtronger Nature.</p>
            <p>It is to the Strength of this amazing Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are to attribute that unequal'd Fire and Rapture, which is ſo forcible in <hi>Homer,</hi> that no Man of a true Poetical Spirit is Maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf while he reads him. What he writes is of the moſt animated Nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:5"/>
Action. If a Council be call'd, or a Battel fought, you are not coldly inform'd of what was ſaid or done as from a third Perſon; the Reader is hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd out of himſelf by the Force of the Poet's Imagination, and turns in one place to a Hearer, in another to a Spectator. The Courſe of his Verſes reſembles that of the Army he deſcribes,<q>

               <hi>They pour along like a Fire that ſweeps the whole Earth before it.</hi> 'Tis however remarkable that his Fancy, which is every where vigorous, is not diſcover'd immediately at the beginning of his Poem in its fulleſt Splendor: It grows in the Progreſs both upon himſelf and others, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes on Fire like a Chariot-Wheel, by its own Rapidity. Exact Diſpoſition, juſt Thought, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Elocution, poliſh'd Numbers, may have been found in a thouſand; but this Poetical <hi>Fire,</hi> this <hi>Vivida vis animi,</hi> in a very few. Even in Works where all thoſe are imperfect or neglected, this can over-power Criticiſm, and make us admire even while we diſ-approve. Nay, where this appears, tho' attended with Abſurdities, it brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens all the Rubbiſh about it, 'till we ſee nothing but its own Splendor. This <hi>Fire</hi> is diſcern'd in <hi>Virgil,</hi> but diſcern'd as through a Glaſs, refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and more ſhining than warm, but every where equal and conſtant: In <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Statius,</hi> it burſts out in ſudden, ſhort, and interrupted Flaſhes: In <hi>Milton,</hi> it glows like a Furnace kept
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:6"/>
up to an uncommon Fierceneſs by the Force of Art: In <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> it ſtrikes before we are aware, like an accidental Fire from Heaven: But in <hi>Homer,</hi> and in him only, it burns every where clearly, and every where irreſiſtibly.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here endeavour to ſhow, how this vaſt <hi>Invention</hi> exerts itſelf in a manner ſuperior to that of any Poet, thro' all the main conſtituent Parts of his Work, as it is the great and peculiar Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick which diſtinguiſhes him from all other Authors.</p>
            <p>This ſtrong and ruling Faculty was like a powerful Planet, which in the Violence of its Courſe, drew all things within its <hi>Vortex.</hi> It ſeem'd not enough to have taken in the whole Circle of Arts, and the whole Compaſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; all the inward Paſſions and Affections of Mankind to ſupply this Characters, and all the outward Forms and Images of Things for his Deſcriptions; but wanting yet an ampler Sphere to expatiate in, he open'd a new and boundleſs Walk for his Imagination, and created a World for himſelf in the Invention of <hi>Fable.</hi> That which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the <hi>Soul of Poetry,</hi> was firſt breath'd into it by <hi>Homer.</hi> I ſhall begin with conſidering him in this Part, as it is naturally the firſt, and I ſpeak of it both as it means the Deſign of a Poem, and as it is taken for Fiction.</p>
            <p>Fable may be divided into the <hi>Probable,</hi> the <hi>Allegorical,</hi> and the <hi>Marvelous.</hi> The <hi>Probable</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0356100101:7"/>
               <hi>Fable</hi> is the Recital of ſuch Actions as tho' they did not happen, yet might, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of Nature: Or of ſuch as tho' they did, become Fables by the additional Epiſodes and manner of telling them. Of this ſort is the main Story of an Epic Poem, <hi>the Return of</hi> Ulyſſes, <hi>the Settlement of the</hi> Trojans <hi>in</hi> Italy, or the like. That of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is <hi>the Anger of</hi> Achilles, the moſt ſhort and ſingle Subject that ever was choſen by any Poet. Yet this he has ſupplied with a vaſter Variety of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Events, and crouded with a greater Number of Councils, Speeches, Battles, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in thoſe Poems whoſe Schemes are of the utmoſt Latitude and Irregularity. The Action is hurry'd on with the moſt vehement Spirit, and its whole Duration employs not ſo much as fifty Days. <hi>Virgil,</hi> for want of ſo warm a Genius, aided himſelf by taking in a more extenſive Subject, as well as a greater Length of Time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Deſign of both <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other Epic Poets have us'd the ſame Practice, but generally carry'd it ſo far as to ſuperinduce a Multiplicity of Fables, deſtroy the Unity of Action, and loſe their Readers in an unreaſonable Length of Time. Nor is it only in the main Deſign that they have been unable to add to his Invention, but they have follow'd him in every Epiſode and Part of Story. If he has
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:8"/>
given a regular <hi>Catalogue</hi> of an <hi>Army,</hi> they all draw up their Forces in the ſame Order. If he has funeral Games for <hi>Patroclus, Virgil</hi> has the ſame for <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> and <hi>Statius</hi> (rather than omit them) deſtroys the Unity of his Action for thoſe of <hi>Archemorus.</hi> If <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> viſit the Shades, the <hi>Aeneas</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> of <hi>Silius</hi> are ſent after him. If he be detain'd from his Return by the Allurements of <hi>Calypſo,</hi> ſo is <hi>Aeneas</hi> by <hi>Dido,</hi> and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> by <hi>Armida.</hi> If <hi>Achilles</hi> be abſent from the Army on the Score of a Quarrel thro' half the Poem, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> muſt abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt as long, on the like account. If he gives his Heroe a Suit of celeſtial Armour, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> and <hi>Taſſo</hi> make the ſame Preſent to theirs. <hi>Virgil</hi> has not only obſerv'd this cloſe Imitation of <hi>Homer,</hi> but where he had not led the way, ſupply'd the Want from other <hi>Greek</hi> Authors. Thus the Story of <hi>Sinon</hi> and the <hi>Taking of Troy</hi> was copied (ſays <hi>Macrobius</hi>) almoſt word for word from <hi>Piſander,</hi> as the Loves of <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> are taken from thoſe of <hi>Medaea</hi> and <hi>Jaſon</hi> in <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and ſeveral others in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>To proceed to the <hi>Allegorical Fable:</hi> If we reflect upon thoſe innumerable Knowledges, thoſe Secrets of Nature and Phyſical Philoſophy which <hi>Homer</hi> is generally ſuppos'd to have wrapt up in his <hi>Allegories,</hi> what a new and ample Scene of Wonder may this Conſideration afford us? How fertile will that Imagination appear, which was
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:9"/>
able to cloath all the Properties of Elements, the Qualifications of the Mind, the Virtues and Vices, in Forms and Perſons; and to introduce them into Actions agreeable to the Nature of the Things they ſhadow'd? This is a Field in which no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Poets could diſpute with <hi>Homer;</hi> and whatever Commendations have been allow'd them on this Head, are by no means for their Invention in having enlarg'd his Circle, but for their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in having contracted it. For when the Mode of Learning chang'd in following Ages, and Science was deliver'd in a plainer manner, it then became as reaſonable in the more modern Poets to lay it aſide, as it was in <hi>Homer</hi> to make uſe of it. And perhaps it was no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circumſtance for <hi>Virgil,</hi> that there was not in his Time that Demand upon him of ſo great an Invention, as might be capable of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing all thoſe Allegorical Parts of a Poem.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marvelous Fable</hi> includes whatever is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, and eſpecially the Machines of the Gods. If <hi>Homer</hi> was not the firſt who introduc'd the Deities (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> imagines) into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Greece,</hi> he ſeems the firſt who brought them into a Syſtem of <hi>Machinery</hi> for Poetry, and ſuch an one as makes its greateſt Importance and Dignity. For we find thoſe Authors who have been offended at the literal Notion of the Gods, conſtantly laying their Accuſation againſt <hi>Homer</hi> as the undoubted Inventor of them. But whatever cauſe there might be to blame his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0356100101:10"/>
in a Philoſophical or Religious View, they are ſo perfect in the Poetick, that Mankind have been ever ſince contented to follow them: None have been able to enlarge the Sphere of Poetry beyond the Limits he has ſet: Every Attempt of this Nature has prov'd unſucceſsful; and after all the various Changes of Times and Religions, his Gods continue to this Day the Gods of Poetry.</p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>Characters</hi> of his Perſons, and here we ſhall find no Author has ever drawn ſo many with ſo viſible and ſurprizing a Variety, or given us ſuch lively and affecting Impreſſions of them. Every one has ſomething ſo ſingularly his own, that no Painter could have diſtinguiſh'd them more by their Features, than the Poet has by their Manners. Nothing can be more exact than the Diſtinctions he has obſerv'd in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of Virtues and Vices. The ſingle Quality of <hi>Courage</hi> is wonderfully diverſify'd in the ſeveral Characters of the <hi>Iliad.</hi> That of <hi>Achilles</hi> is furious and intractable; that of <hi>Diomede</hi> forward, yet liſtening to Advice and ſubject to Command: We ſee in <hi>Ajax</hi> an heavy and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſidering Valour, in <hi>Hector</hi> an active and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant one: The Courage of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by Love of Empire and Ambition, that of <hi>Menelaus</hi> mix'd with Softneſs and Tenderneſs for his People: We find in <hi>Idomeneus</hi> a plain direct Soldier, in <hi>Sarpedon</hi> a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and aſtoniſhing Diverſity to
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:11"/>
be found only in the principal Quality which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the Main of each Character, but even in the Under-parts of it, to which he takes care to give a Tincture of that principal one. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the main Characters of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> and <hi>Neſtor</hi> conſiſt in <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and they are diſtinct in this; the Wiſdom of one is <hi>artificial</hi> and <hi>various,</hi> of the other <hi>natural, open,</hi> and <hi>regular.</hi> But they have, beſides, Characters of <hi>Courage;</hi> and this Quality alſo takes a different Turn in each from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of his Prudence: For one in the War de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ſtill upon <hi>Caution,</hi> the other upon <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</hi> It would be endleſs to produce Inſtances of theſe Kinds. The Characters of <hi>Virgil</hi> are far from ſtriking us in this open manner; they lie in a great degree hidden and undiſtinguiſh'd, and where they are mark'd moſt evidently, affect us not in proportion to thoſe of <hi>Homer.</hi> His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Valour are much alike; even that of <hi>Turnus</hi> ſeems no way peculiar but as it is in a ſuperior degree; and we ſee nothing that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences the Courage of <hi>Mneſtheus</hi> from that of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſthus, Cloanthus,</hi> or the reſt. In like manner it may be remark'd of <hi>Statius</hi>'s Heroes, that an Air of Impetuoſity runs thro' them all; the ſame hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and ſavage Courage appears in his <hi>Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon,</hi> &amp;c. They have a Parity of Character which makes them ſeem Brothers of one Family. I believe when the Reader is led into this Track of Reflection, if he will purſue it through the <hi>Epic</hi> and <hi>Tragic</hi> Writers, he will be convinced
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:12"/>
how infinitely ſuperior in this Point the Invention of <hi>Homer</hi> was to that of all others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Speeches</hi> are to be conſider'd as they ſlow from the Characters, being perfect or defective as they agree or diſagree with the Manners of thoſe who utter them. As there is more variety of Characters in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> ſo there is of Speeches, than in any other Poem. <hi>Every thing in it has Manners</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> expreſſes it) that is, every thing is acted or ſpoken. It is hardly credible in a Work of ſuch length, how ſmall a Number of Lines are employ'd in Narration. In <hi>Virgil</hi> the Dramatic Part is leſs in proportion to the Narrative; and the Speeches often conſiſt of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reflections or Thoughts, which might be equally juſt in any Perſon's Mouth upon the ſame Occaſion. As many of his Perſons have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Characters, ſo many of his Speeches eſcape being apply'd and judg'd by the Rule of Propriety. We oftner think of the Author himſelf when we read <hi>Virgil,</hi> than when we are engag'd in <hi>Homer:</hi> All which are the Effects of a colder Invention, that intereſts us leſs in the Action deſcrib'd: <hi>Homer</hi> makes us Hearers, and <hi>Virgil</hi> leaves us Readers.</p>
            <p>If in the next place we take a View of the <hi>Sentiments,</hi> the ſame preſiding Faculty is eminent in the Sublimity and Spirit of his Thoughts. <hi>Longinus</hi> has given his Opinion, that it was in this Part <hi>Homer</hi> principally excell'd. What were alone ſufficient to prove the Grandeur and Excellence of his Sentiments in general, is that
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:13"/>
they have ſo remarkable a Parity with thoſe of the Scripture: <hi>Duport,</hi> in his <hi>Gnomologia Homerica,</hi> has collected innumerable Inſtances of this ſort. And it is with Juſtice an excellent modern Writer allows, that if <hi>Virgil</hi> has not ſo many Thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not ſo many that are ſublime and noble; and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Author ſeldom riſes into very aſtoniſhing Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments where he is not fired by the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we obſerve his <hi>Deſcriptions, Images,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles,</hi> we ſhall find the Invention ſtill predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. To what elſe can we aſcribe that vaſt Comprehenſion of Images of every ſort, where we ſee each Circumſtance and Individual of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſummon'd together by the Extent and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity of his Imagination; to which all things, in their various Views, preſented themſelves in an Inſtant, and had their Impreſſions taken off to Perfection at a Heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full Proſpects of Things, but ſeveral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Peculiarities and Side-Views, unobſerv'd by any Painter but <hi>Homer.</hi> Nothing is ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing as the Deſcriptions of his Battels, which take up no leſs than half the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with ſo vaſt a Variety of Incidents, that no one bears a Likeneſs to another; ſuch different Kinds of Deaths, that no two Heroes are wounded in the ſame manner; and ſuch a Profuſion of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ideas, that every Battel riſes above the laſt in Greatneſs, Horror, and Confuſion. It is certain there is not near that Number of Images and
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:14"/>
Deſcriptions in any Epic Poet; tho' every one has aſſiſted himſelf with a great Quantity out of him: And it is evident of <hi>Virgil</hi> eſpecially, that he has ſcarce any Compariſons which are not drawn from his Maſter.</p>
            <p>If we deſcend from hence to the <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> we ſee the bright Imagination of <hi>Homer</hi> ſhining out in the moſt enliven'd Forms of it. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him the Father of Poetical Diction, the firſt who taught that <hi>Language of the Gods</hi> to Men. His Expreſſion is like the colouring of ſome great Maſters, which diſcovers itſelf to be laid on boldly, and executed with Rapidity. It is indeed the ſtrongeſt and moſt glowing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and touch'd with the greateſt Spirit. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had reaſon to ſay, He was the only Poet who had found out <hi>Living Words;</hi> there are in him more daring Figures and Metaphors than in any good Author whatever. An Arrow is <hi>impatient</hi> to be on the Wing, a Weapon <hi>thirſts</hi> to drink the Blood of an Enemy, and the like. Yet his Expreſſion is never too big for the Senſe, but juſtly great in proportion to it: 'Tis the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſwells and fills out the Diction, which riſes with it, and forms itſelf about it. For in the ſame degree that a <hi>Thought</hi> is warmer, an <hi>Expreſſion</hi> will be brighter; and as That is more ſtrong, This will become more perſpicuous: Like Glaſs in the Furnace which grows to a greater Magnitude, and refines to a greater Clearneſs, only as the <hi>Breath</hi> within is more powerful, and the <hi>Heat</hi> more intenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0356100101:15"/>
To throw his Language more out of Proſe, <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems to have affected the <hi>Compound-Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets.</hi> This was a ſort of Compoſition peculiarly proper to Poetry, not only as it heighten'd the <hi>Diction,</hi> but as it aſſiſted and fill'd the <hi>Numbers</hi> with greater Sound and Pomp, and likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in ſome meaſure to thicken the <hi>Images.</hi> On this laſt Conſideration I cannot but attribute theſe to the Fruitfulneſs of his Invention, ſince (as he has manag'd them) they are a ſort of ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary Pictures of the Perſons or Things they are join'd to. We ſee the Motion of <hi>Hector</hi>'s Plumes in the Epithet <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Landſcape of Mount <hi>Neritus</hi> in that of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſo of others; which particular Images could not have been inſiſted upon ſo long as to expreſs them in a Deſcription (tho' but of a ſingle Line) without diverting the Reader too much from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Action or Figure. As a Metaphor is a ſhort Simile, one of theſe Epithets is a ſhort Deſcription.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if we conſider his <hi>Verſification,</hi> we ſhall be ſenſible what a Share of Praiſe is due to his Invention in that alſo. He was not ſatisfy'd with his Language as he found it ſettled in any one Part of <hi>Greece,</hi> but ſearch'd thro' its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Dialects</hi> with this particular View, to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and perfect his Numbers: He conſider'd theſe as they had a greater Mixture of Vowels or Conſonants, and accordingly employ'd them as the Verſe requir'd either a greater Smoothneſs
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:16"/>
or Strength. What he moſt affected was the <hi>Ionic,</hi> which has a peculiar Sweetneſs from its never uſing Contractions, and from its Cuſtom of reſolving the Diphthongs into two Syllables; ſo as to make the Words open themſelves with a more ſpreading and ſonorous Fluency. With this he mingled the <hi>Attic</hi> Contractions, the broader <hi>Doric,</hi> and the feebler <hi>Aeolic,</hi> which often rejects its Aſpirate, or takes off its Accent; and compleated this Variety by altering ſome Letters with the Licenſe of Poetry. Thus his Meaſures, inſtead of being Fetters to his Senſe, were always in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to run along with the Warmth of his Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and even to give a farther Repreſentation of his Notions, in the Correſpondence of their Sounds to what they ſignify'd. Out of all theſe he has deriv'd that Harmony, which makes us confeſs he had not only the richeſt Head, but the fineſt Ear in the World. This is ſo great a Truth, that whoever will but conſult the Tune of his Verſes even without underſtanding them (with the ſame ſort of Diligence as we daily ſee practis'd in the Caſe of <hi>Italian Opera's</hi>) will find more Sweetneſs, Variety, and Majeſty of Sound, than in any other Language or Poetry. The Beauty of his Numbers is allow'd by the Criticks to be copied but faintly by <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf, tho' they are ſo juſt to aſcribe it to the Nature of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue. Indeed the <hi>Greek</hi> has ſome Advantages both from the natural <hi>Sound</hi> of its <hi>Words,</hi> and the Turn and <hi>Cadence</hi> of its <hi>Verſe,</hi> which agree
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:17"/>
with the Genius of no other Language. <hi>Virgil</hi> was very ſenſible of this, and uſed the utmoſt Diligence in working up a more intractable Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to whatſoever Graces it was capable of, and in particular never fail'd to bring the Sound of his Line to a beautiful Agreement with its Senſe. If the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet has not been ſo frequently ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated on this Account as the <hi>Roman,</hi> the only reaſon is, that fewer Criticks have underſtood one Language than the other. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> has pointed out many of our Author's Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this kind, in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Compoſition of Words,</hi> and others will be taken notice of in the Courſe of the Notes. It ſuffices at preſent to obſerve of his Numbers, that they flow with ſo much eaſe, as to make one imagine <hi>Homer</hi> had no other care than to tranſcribe as faſt as the <hi>Muſes</hi> dictated; and at the ſame time with ſo much Force and inſpiriting Vigour, that they awaken and raiſe us like the Sound of a Trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful River, always in motion, and always full; while we are born away by a Tide of Verſe, the moſt rapid, and yet the moſt ſmooth imaginable.</p>
            <p>Thus on whatever ſide we contemplate <hi>Homer,</hi> what principally ſtrikes us is his <hi>Invention.</hi> It is that which forms the Character of each Part of his Work; and accordingly we find it to have made his Fable more <hi>extenſive</hi> and <hi>copious</hi> than any other, his Manners more <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>ſtrongly marked,</hi> his Speeches more <hi>affecting</hi> and <hi>tranſported,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0356100101:18"/>
his Sentiments more <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>ſublime,</hi> his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Deſcriptions more <hi>full</hi> and <hi>animated,</hi> his Expreſſion more <hi>rais'd</hi> and <hi>daring,</hi> and his Numbers more <hi>rapid</hi> and <hi>various.</hi> I hope in what has been ſaid of <hi>Virgil</hi> with regard to any of theſe Heads, I have no way derogated from his Character. Nothing is more abſurd or end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, than the common Method of comparing eminent Writers by an Oppoſition of particular Paſſages in them, and forming a Judgment from thence of their Merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain Knowledge of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Character and diſtinguiſhing Excellence of each: It is in <hi>that</hi> we are to conſider him, and in proportion to his Degree in <hi>that</hi> we are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him. No Author or Man ever excell'd all the World in more than one Faculty, and as <hi>Homer</hi> has done this in Invention, <hi>Virgil</hi> has in Judgment. Not that we are to think <hi>Homer</hi> wanted Judgment, becauſe <hi>Virgil</hi> had it in a more eminent degree; or that <hi>Virgil</hi> wanted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, becauſe <hi>Homer</hi> poſſeſt a larger ſhare of it: Each of theſe great Authors had more of both than perhaps any Man beſides, and are only ſaid to have leſs in Compariſon with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Homer</hi> was the greater Genius, <hi>Virgil</hi> the better Artiſt. In one we moſt admire the <hi>Man,</hi> in the other the <hi>Work. Homer</hi> hurries and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us with a commanding Impetuoſity, <hi>Virgil</hi> leads us with an attractive Majeſty: <hi>Homer</hi> ſcatters with a generous Profuſion, <hi>Virgil</hi> beſtows
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:19"/>
with a careful Magnificence: <hi>Homer,</hi> like the <hi>Nile,</hi> pours out his Riches with a ſudden Overflow; <hi>Virgil</hi> like a River in its Banks, with a gentle and conſtant Stream. When we behold their Battels, methinks the two Poets reſemble the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes they celebrate: <hi>Homer,</hi> boundleſs and irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible as <hi>Achilles,</hi> bears all before him, and ſhines more and more as the Tumult increaſes; <hi>Virgil,</hi> calmly daring like <hi>Aeneas,</hi> appears undiſturb'd in the midſt of the Action, diſpoſes all about him, and conquers with Tranquillity: And when we look upon their Machines, <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems like his own <hi>Jupiter</hi> in his Terrors, ſhaking <hi>Olympus,</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Lightnings, and firing the Heavens; <hi>Virgil,</hi> like the ſame Power in his Benevolence, counſelling with the Gods, laying Plans for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and regularly ordering his whole Creation.</p>
            <p>But after all, it is with great Parts as with great Virtues, they naturally border on ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; and it is often hard to diſtinguiſh exactly where the Virtue ends, or the Fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. As Prudence may ſometimes ſink to Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, ſo may a great Judgment decline to Coldneſs; and as Magnanimity may run up to Profuſion or Extravagance, ſo may a great Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Redundancy or Wildneſs. If we look upon <hi>Homer</hi> in this View, we ſhall perceive the chief <hi>Objections</hi> againſt him to proceed from ſo noble a Cauſe as the Exceſs of this Faculty.</p>
            <p>Among theſe we may reckon ſome of his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Fictions,</hi> upon which ſo much Criticiſm
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:20"/>
has been ſpent as ſurpaſſing all the Bounds of Probability. Perhaps it may be with great and ſuperior Souls as with gigantick Bodies, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting themſelves with unuſual Strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due Proportion of Parts, to become Miracles in the whole; and like the old Heroes of that Make, commit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near Extravagance amidſt a Series of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inimitable Performances. Thus <hi>Homer</hi> has his <hi>ſpeaking Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Myrtles diſtilling Blood,</hi> without ſo much as contriving the eaſy Intervention of a Deity to ſave the Probability.</p>
            <p>It is owing to the ſame vaſt Invention that his <hi>Similes</hi> have been thought too exuberant and full of Circumſtances. The Force of this Faculty is ſeen in nothing more, than its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to confine itſelf to that ſingle Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon which the Compariſon is grounded: It runs out into Embelliſhments of additional Images, which however are ſo manag'd as not to overpower the main one. His Similes are like Pictures, where the principal Figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the Original, but is alſo ſet off with occaſional Ornaments and Proſpects. The ſame will account for his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of heaping a Number of Compariſons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one Breath, when his Fancy ſuggeſted to him at once ſo many various and correſpondent Images. The Reader will eaſily extend this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to more Objections of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0356100101:21"/>
If there are others which ſeem rather to charge him with a Defect or Narrowneſs of Genius, than an Exceſs of it; thoſe ſeeming Defects will be found upon Examination to proceed wholly from the Nature of the Times he liv'd in. Such are his <hi>groſſer Repreſentations</hi> of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and the vicious and <hi>imperfect Manners</hi> of his <hi>Heroes,</hi> which will be treated of in the following <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See the Articles of</hi> Theology <hi>and</hi> Morality, <hi>in the third Part of the</hi> Eſſay.</note>
               <hi>Eſſay:</hi> But I muſt here ſpeak a word of the latter, as it is a Point generally carry'd into Extreams both by the Cenſurers and Defenders of <hi>Homer.</hi> It muſt be a ſtrange Partiality to Antiquity to think with Madam <hi>Dacier,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"that <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Preface to her</hi> Homer.</note> thoſe Times and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ſo much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours"</q> Who can be ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced in their Favour as to magnify the Felicity of thoſe Ages, when a Spirit of Revenge and Cruelty reign'd thro' the World, when no Mercy was ſhown but for the ſake of Lucre, when the greateſt Princes were put to the Sword, and their Wives and Daughters made Slaves and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines? On the other ſide I would not be ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as thoſe modern Criticks, who are ſhock'd at the <hi>ſervile Offices</hi> and <hi>mean Employments</hi> in which we ſometimes ſee the Heroes of <hi>Homer</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd. There is a Pleaſure in taking a view of that Simplicity in Oppoſition to the Luxury of ſucceeding Ages; in beholding Monarchs without their Guards, Princes tending their Flocks, and
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:22"/>
Princeſſes drawing Water from the Springs. When we read <hi>Homer,</hi> we ought to reflect that we are reading the moſt ancient Author in the Heathen World; and thoſe who conſider him in this Light, will double their Pleaſure in the Peruſal of him. Let them think they are growing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Nations and People that are now no more; that they are ſtepping almoſt three thouſand Years backward into the remoteſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and entertaining themſelves with a clear and ſurprizing Viſion of Things no where elſe to be found, and the only authentick Picture of that ancient World. By this means alone their greateſt Obſtacles will vaniſh; and what uſually creates their Diſlike, will become a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration may farther ſerve to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the conſtant Uſe of the ſame <hi>Epithets</hi> to his Gods and Heroes, ſuch as the <hi>far-darting Phoebus,</hi> the <hi>blue-ey'd Pallas,</hi> the <hi>ſwift-footed Achilles,</hi> &amp;c. which ſome have cenſured as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and tediouſly repeated. Thoſe of the Gods depended upon the Powers and Offices then believ'd to belong to them, and had contracted a Weight and Veneration from the Rites and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Devotions in which they were us'd: They were a ſort of Attributes that it was a Matter of Religion to ſalute them with on all Occaſions, and an Irreverence to omit. As for the Epithets of great Men, Monſ. <hi>Boileau</hi> is of Opinion; that they were in the Nature of <hi>Surnames,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:23"/>
as ſuch; for the <hi>Greeks</hi> having no Names deriv'd from their Fathers, were oblig'd when they mention'd any one to add ſome other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; either naming his Parents expreſsly, or his Place of Birth, Profeſſion, or the like: As <hi>Alexander</hi> Son of <hi>Philip, Herodotus</hi> of <hi>Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus, Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynic, &amp;c. Homer</hi> therefore complying with the Cuſtom of his Countrey, us'd ſuch diſtinctive Additions as better agreed with Poetry. And indeed we have ſomething parallel to theſe in modern Times, ſuch as the Names of <hi>Harold Harefoot, Edmund Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, Edward Long-ſhanks, Edward</hi> the <hi>black Prince, &amp;c.</hi> If yet this be thought to account better for the Propriety than for the Repetition, I ſhall add a farther Conjecture. <hi>Heſiod</hi> dividing the World into its Ages, has plac'd a fourth Age between the Brazen and the Iron one, of <hi>Heroes diſtinct from other Men, a divine Race, who fought at</hi> Thebes <hi>and</hi> Troy, <hi>are called Demi-Gods, and live by the Care of</hi> Jupiter <hi>in the Iſlands of the Bleſſed</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heſiod, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. ℣. 155, &amp;c.</note>. Now among the divine Honours which were paid them, they might have this alſo in common with the Gods, not to be mention'd without the Solemnity of an Epithet, and ſuch as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their Families, Actions, or Qualities.</p>
            <p>What other Cavils have been rais'd againſt <hi>Homer</hi> are ſuch as hardly deſerve a Reply, but
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:24"/>
will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the Courſe of the Work. Many have been occaſion'd by an injudicious Endeavour to exalt <hi>Virgil;</hi> which is much the ſame, as if one ſhould think to praiſe the Superſtructure by undermining the Foundation: One would imagine by the whole Courſe of their Parallels, that theſe Criticks never ſo much as heard of <hi>Homer</hi>'s having written firſt; a Conſideration which whoever compares theſe two Poets ought to have always in his Eye. Some accuſe him for the ſame things which they overlook or praiſe in the other; as when they prefer the Fable and Moral of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> to thoſe of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> for the ſame Reaſons which might ſet the <hi>Odyſſes</hi> above the <hi>Aeneis:</hi> as that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe is a wiſer Man; and the Action of the one more beneficial to his Countrey than that of the other: Or elſe they blame him for not doing what he never deſign'd; as becauſe <hi>Achilles</hi> is not as good and perfect a Prince as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when the very Moral of his Poem requir'd a contrary Character. It is thus that <hi>Rapin</hi> judges in his Compariſon of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> Others ſelect thoſe particular Paſſages of <hi>Homer</hi> which are not ſo labour'd as ſome that <hi>Virgil</hi> drew out of them: This is the whole Management of <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his <hi>Poetices.</hi> Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean Expreſſions, ſometimes thro' a falſe Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and Refinement, oftner from an Ignorance of the Graces of the Original; and then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the Aukwardneſs of their own Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:25"/>
This is the Conduct of <hi>Perault</hi> in his <hi>Parallels.</hi> Laſtly, there are others, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a fairer Proceeding, diſtinguiſh between the perſonal Merit of <hi>Homer,</hi> and that of his <hi>Work;</hi> but when they come to aſſign the Cauſes of the great Reputation of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> they found it upon the Ignorance of his Times, and the Prejudice of thoſe that followed. And in purſuance of this Principle, they make thoſe Accidents (ſuch as the Contention of the Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to be the Cauſes of his Fame, which were in Reality the Conſequences of his Merit. The ſame might as well be ſaid of <hi>Virgil,</hi> or any great Author, whoſe general Character will infallibly raiſe many caſual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to their Reputation. This is the Method of Monſ. <hi>de la Motte;</hi> who yet confeſſes upon the whole, that in whatever Age <hi>Homer</hi> had liv'd he muſt have been the greateſt Poet of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he may be ſaid in this Senſe to be the Maſter even of thoſe who ſurpaſs'd him.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Objections we ſee nothing that contradicts his Title to the Honour of the chief <hi>Invention;</hi> and as long as this (which is indeed the Characteriſtic of Poetry itſelf) remains une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual'd by his Followers, he ſtill continues ſuperior to them. A cooler Judgment may commit fewer Faults, and be more approv'd in the Eves of <hi>One Sort</hi> of Criticks: but that Warmth of Fancy will carry the loudeſt and moſt univerſal Applauſes which holds the Heart of a Reader under the ſtrongeſt Enchantment. <hi>Homer</hi> not only appears

the Inventor of Poetry, but excells all the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of other Arts in this, that he has ſwallow'd up the Honour of thoſe who ſucceeded him. What he has done admitted no Encreaſe, it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſt room for Contraction or Regulation. He ſhew'd all the Stretch of Fancy at once; and if he has fail'd in ſome of his Flights, it was but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he attempted every thing. A Work of this kind ſeems like a mighty Tree which riſes from the moſt vigorous Seed, is improv'd with Induſtry, flouriſhes, and produces the fineſt Fruit; Nature and Art have conſpir'd to raiſe it; Pleaſure and Profit join'd to make it valuable: and they who find the juſteſt Faults, have only ſaid, that a few Branches (which run luxuriant thro' a Richneſs of Nature) might be lopp'd into Form to give it a more regular Appearance.</p>
            <p>Having now ſpoken of the Beauties and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Original, it remains to treat of the Tranſlation, with the ſame View to the chief Characteriſtic. As far as that is ſeen in the main Parts of the Poem, ſuch as the <hi>Fable, Manners,</hi> and <hi>Sentiments,</hi> no Tranſlator can prejudice it but by wilful Omiſſions or Contractions. As it alſo breaks out in every particular <hi>Image, Deſcription,</hi> and <hi>Simile;</hi> whoever leſſens or too much ſoftens thoſe, takes off from this chief Character. It is the firſt grand Duty of an Interpreter to give his Author entire and unmaim'd; and for the reſt, the <hi>Diction</hi> and <hi>Verſification</hi> only are his
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:27"/>
proper Province; ſince theſe muſt be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</p>
            <p>It ſhould then be conſider'd what Methods may afford ſome Equivalent in our Language for the Graces of theſe in the <hi>Greek.</hi> It is certain no literal Tranſlation can be juſt to an excellent Original in a ſuperior Language: but it is a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to imagine (as many have done) that a raſh Paraphraſe can make amends for this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Defect; which is no leſs in danger to loſe the Spirit of an Ancient, by deviating into the modern Manners of Expreſſion. If there be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> there is often a <hi>Light</hi> in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which nothing better preſerves than a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion almoſt literal. I know no Liberties one ought to take, but thoſe which are neceſſary for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the Spirit of the Original, and ſupporting the Poetical Style of the Tranſlation: and I will venture to ſay, there have not been more Men miſled in former times by a ſervile dull Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical inſolent Hope of raiſing and improving their Author. It is not to be doubted that the <hi>Fire</hi> of the Poem is what a Tranſlator ſhould principally regard, as it is moſt likely to expire in his managing: However it is his ſafeſt way to be content with preſerving this to his utmoſt in the Whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is, in any particular Place. 'Tis a great Secret in Writing to know when to be plain, and when poetical
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:28"/>
and figurative; and it is what <hi>Homer</hi> will teach us if we will but follow modeſtly in his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps. Where his Diction is bold and lofty, let us raiſe ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterr'd from imitating him by the fear of incurring the Cenſure of a meer <hi>Engliſh</hi> Critick. Nothing that belongs to <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems to have been more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly miſtaken than the juſt Pitch of his Style: Some of his Tranſlators having ſwell'd into Fuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in a proud Confidence of the <hi>Sublime;</hi> others ſunk into Flatneſs in a cold and timorous Notion of <hi>Simplicity.</hi> Methinks I ſee theſe different Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Homer,</hi> ſome ſweating and ſtraining after him by violent Leaps and Bounds, (the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Signs of falſe Mettle) others ſlowly and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilely creeping in his Train, while the Poet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal Majeſty before them. However of the two Extreams one could ſooner pardon Frenzy than Frigidity: No Author is to be envy'd for ſuch Commendations as he may gain by that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Style, which his Friends muſt agree together to call <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and the reſt of the World will call <hi>Dulneſs.</hi> There is a <hi>graceful</hi> and <hi>dignify'd</hi> Simplicity, as well as a <hi>bald</hi> and <hi>ſordid</hi> one, which differ as much from each other as the Air of a <hi>plain</hi> Man from that of a <hi>Sloven:</hi> 'Tis one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dreſs'd at all. Simplicity is the Mean between Oſtentation and Ruſticity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0356100101:29"/>
This pure and noble Simplicity is no where in ſuch Perfection as in the <hi>Scripture</hi> and our Author. One may affirm with all reſpect to the inſpired Writings, that the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> made uſe of no other Words but what were intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and common to Men at that Time, and in that Part of the World; and as <hi>Homer</hi> is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor neareſt to thoſe, his Style muſt of courſe bear a greater Reſemblance to the ſacred Books than that of any other Writer. This Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (together with what has been obſerv'd of the Parity of ſome of his Thoughts) may methinks induce a Tranſlator on the one hand to give into ſeveral of thoſe general Phraſes and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Expreſſion, which have attain'd a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration even in our Language from their uſe in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> as on the other, to avoid thoſe which have been appropriated to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and in a manner conſign'd to Myſtery and Religion.</p>
            <p>For a farther Preſervation of this Air of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, a particular Care ſhould be taken to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs with all Plainneſs thoſe <hi>Moral Sentences</hi> and <hi>Proverbial Speeches</hi> which are ſo numerous in this Poet. They have ſomething Venerable, and as I may ſay <hi>Oracular,</hi> in that unadorn'd Gravity and Shortneſs with which they are deliver'd: a Grace which would be utterly loſt by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to give them what we call a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious (that is a more modern) Turn in the Paraphraſe.</p>

Perhaps the Mixture of ſome <hi>Graeciſms</hi> and old Words after the manner of <hi>Milton,</hi> if done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out too much Affectation, might not have an ill Effect in a Verſion of this particular Work, which moſt of any other ſeems to require a venerable <hi>Antique</hi> Caſt. But certainly the uſe of <hi>modern Terms</hi> of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Platoon, Campagne, Junto,</hi> or the like (which ſome of his Tranſlators have fallen into) cannot be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; thoſe only excepted, without which it is impoſſible to treat the Subjects in any living Language.</p>
            <p>There are two Peculiarities in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Diction that are a ſort of <hi>Marks</hi> or <hi>Moles,</hi> by which every common Eye diſtinguiſhes him at firſt ſight: Thoſe who are not his greateſt Admirers look upon them as Defects, and thoſe who are ſeem pleaſed with them as Beauties. I ſpeak of his <hi>Compound-Epithets</hi> and of his <hi>Repetitions.</hi> Many of the former cannot be done literally into <hi>Engliſh</hi> without deſtroying the Purity of our Language. I believe ſuch ſhould be retain'd as ſlide eaſily of themſelves into an <hi>Engliſh-Compound,</hi> without Violence to the Ear or to the receiv'd Rules of Compoſition; as well as thoſe which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Sanction from the Authority of our beſt Poets, and are become familiar thro' their uſe of them; ſuch as the <hi>Cloud-compelling Jove, &amp;c.</hi> As for the reſt, whenever any can be as fully and ſignificantly expreſt in a ſingle word as in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded one, the Courſe to be taken is obvious.
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:33"/>
Some that cannot be ſo turn'd as to preſerve their full Image by one or two Words, may have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done them by Circumlocution; as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

For Example, the Epithet of <hi>Apollo,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>far-ſhooting,</hi> is capable of two Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; one literal in reſpect of the Darts and Bow, the Enſigns of that God; the other allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical with regard to the Rays of the Sun: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch Places where <hi>Apollo</hi> is repreſented as a God in Perſon, I would uſe the former Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and where the Effects of the Sun are deſcrib'd, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be neceſſary to avoid that perpetual Repetition of the ſame Epithets which we find in <hi>Homer,</hi> and which, tho' it might be accommodated (as has been already ſhewn) to the Ear of thoſe Times, is by no means ſo to ours: But one may wait for Opportunities of placing them, where they derive an additional Beauty from the Occaſions on which they are employed; and in doing this properly, a Tranſlator may at once ſhew his Fancy and his Judgment.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Repetitions;</hi> we may divide them into three ſorts; of whole Narrations and
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:34"/>
Speeches, of ſingle Sentences, and of one Verſe or Hemiſtich. I hope it is not impoſſible to have ſuch a Regard to theſe, as neither to loſe ſo known a Mark of the Author on the one hand, nor to offend the Reader too much on the other. The Repetition is not ungraceful in thoſe Speeches where the Dignity of the Speaker renders it a ſort of Inſolence to alter his Words; as in the Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from Gods to Men, or from higher Powers to Inferiors in Concerns of State, or where the Ceremonial of Religion ſeems to require it, in the ſolemn Forms of Prayers, Oaths, or the like. In other Caſes, I believe the beſt Rule is to be guided by the Nearneſs, or Diſtance, at which the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are plac'd in the Original: When they follow too cloſe one may vary the Expreſſion, but it is a Queſtion whether a profeſs'd Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor be authorized to omit any: If they be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Author is to anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>It only remains to ſpeak of the <hi>Verſification. Homer</hi> (as has been ſaid) is perpetually applying the Sound to the Senſe, and varying it on every new Subject. This is indeed one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Beauties of Poetry, and attainable by very few: I know only of <hi>Homer</hi> eminent for it in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> in <hi>Latine.</hi> I am ſenſible it is what may ſometimes happen by Chance, when a Writer is warm, and fully poſſeſt of his Image: however it may be reaſonably believed they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd this, in whoſe Verſe it ſo manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a ſuperior degree to all others. Few
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:35"/>
Readers have the Ear to be Judges of it, but thoſe who have will ſee I have endeavour'd at this Beauty.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I muſt confeſs my ſelf ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable of doing Juſtice to <hi>Homer.</hi> I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt him in no other Hope but that which one may entertain without much Vanity, of giving a more tolerable Copy of him than any entire Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in Verſe has yet done. We have only thoſe of <hi>Chapman, Hobbes,</hi> and <hi>Ogilby. Chapman</hi> has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Advantage of an immeaſurable Length of Verſe, notwithſtanding which there is ſcarce any Paraphraſe more looſe and rambling than his. He has frequent Interpolations of four or ſix Lines, and I remember one in the thirteenth Book of the <hi>Odyſſes, ver.</hi> 312. where he has ſpun twenty Verſes out of two. He is often miſtaken in ſo bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpoſe, if he did not in other Places of his Notes inſiſt ſo much upon Verbal Trifles. He appears to have had a ſtrong Affectation of extracting new Meanings out of his Author, inſomuch as to promiſe in his Rhyming Preface, a Poem of the Myſteries he had revealed in <hi>Homer;</hi> and perhaps he endeavoured to ſtrain the obvious Senſe to this End. His Expreſſion is involved in Fuſtian, a Fault for which he was remarkable in his Original Writings, as in the Tragedy of <hi>Buſſyd' Amboiſe,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, the Nature of the Man may account for his whole Performance; for he appears from his Preface and Remarks to have been of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:36"/>
Turn, and an Enthuſiaſt in Poetry. His own Boaſt of having finiſh'd half the <hi>Iliad</hi> in leſs than fifteen Weeks, ſhews with what Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence his Verſion was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to cover his Defects, is a daring fiery Spirit that animates his Tranſlation, which is ſomething like what one might imagine <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf would have writ before he arriv'd to Years of Diſcretion. <hi>Hobbes</hi> has given us a correct Explanation of the Senſe in general, but for Particulars and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he continually lopps them, and often omits the moſt beautiful. As for its being eſteem'd a cloſe Tranſlation, I doubt not many have been led into that Error by the Shortneſs of it, which proceeds not from his following the Original Line by Line, but from the Contractions above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. He ſometimes omits whole Similes and Sentences, and is now and then guilty of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes which no Writer of his Learning could have fallen into, but thro' Careleſneſs. His Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as <hi>Ogilby</hi>'s, is too mean for Criticiſm.</p>
            <p>It is a great Loſs to the Poetical World that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> did not live to tranſlate the <hi>Iliad.</hi> He has left us only the firſt Book and a ſmall Part of the ſixth; in which if he has in ſome Places not truly interpreted the Senſe, or preſerved the Antiquities, it ought to be excuſed on account of the Haſte he was obliged to write in. He ſeems to have had too much Regard to <hi>Chapman,</hi> whoſe Words he ſometimes copies, and has unhappily
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:37"/>
follow'd him in Paſſages where he wanders from the Original. However had he tranſlated the whole Work, I would no more have attempted <hi>Homer</hi> after him than <hi>Virgil,</hi> his Verſion of whom (notwithſtanding ſome human Errors) is the moſt noble and ſpirited Tranſlation I know in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But the Fate of great Genius's is like that of great Miniſters, tho' they are confeſſedly the firſt in the Commonwealth of Letters, they muſt be envy'd and calumniated only for being at the Head of it.</p>
            <p>That which in my Opinion ought to be the Endeavour of any one who tranſlates <hi>Homer,</hi> is above all things to keep alive that Spirit and Fire which makes his chief Character. In particular Places, where the Senſe can bear any Doubt, to follow the ſtrongeſt and moſt Poetical, as moſt agreeing with that Character. To copy him in all the Variations of his Style, and the different Modulations of his Numbers. To preſerve in the more active or deſcriptive Parts, a Warmth and Elevation; in the more ſedate or narrative, a Plainneſs and Solemnity; in the Speeches a Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Perſpicuity; in the Sentences a Shortneſs and Gravity. Not to neglect even the little Figures and Turns on the Words, nor ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the very Caſt of the Periods. Neither to omit or confound any Rites or Cuſtoms of Antiquity. Perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a ſhorter Compaſs, than has hitherto been done by any Tranſlator who has tolerably
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:38"/>
preſerved either the Senſe or Poetry. What I would farther recommend to him, is to ſtudy his Author rather from his own Text than from any Commentaries, how learned ſoever, or whatever Figure they make in the Eſtimation of the World. To conſider him attentively in Compariſon with <hi>Virgil</hi> above all the Ancients, and with <hi>Milton</hi> above all the Moderns. Next theſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi>'s <hi>Telemachus</hi> may give him the trueſt Idea of the Spirit and Turn of our Author, and <hi>Boſſu</hi>'s admirable Treatiſe of the Epic Poem the juſteſt Notion of his Deſign and Conduct. But after all, with whatever Judgment and Study a Man may proceed, or with whatever Happineſs he may perform ſuch a Work; he muſt hope to pleaſe but a few, thoſe only who have at once a Taſte of Poetry, and competent Learning. For to ſatisfy ſuch as want either, is not in the Nature of this Undertaking; ſince a meer Modern Wit can like nothing that is not <hi>Modern,</hi> and a Pedant nothing that is not <hi>Greek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have done is ſubmitted to the Publick, from whoſe Opinions I am prepared to learn; tho' I fear no Judges ſo little as our beſt Poets, who are moſt ſenſible of the Weight of this Task. As for the worſt, whatever they ſhall pleaſe to ſay, they may give me ſome Concern as they are unhappy Men, but none as they are malignant Writers. I was guided in this Tranſlation by Judgments very different from theirs, and by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whom they can have no Kindneſs, if an
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:39"/>
old Obſervation be true, that the ſtrongeſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in the World is that of Fools to Men of Wit. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was the firſt whoſe Advice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd me to undertake this Task, who was pleas'd to write to me upon that Occaſion in ſuch Terms as I cannot repeat without Vanity. I was obliged to Sir <hi>Richard Steele</hi> for a very early Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my Undertaking to the Publick. Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> promoted my Intereſt with that Warmth with which he always ſerves his Friend. The Humanity and Frankneſs of Sir <hi>Samuel Garth</hi> are what I never knew wanting on any Occaſion. I muſt alſo acknowledge with infinite Pleaſure the many friendly Offices as well as ſincere Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms of Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> who had led me the way in tranſlating ſome Parts of <hi>Homer,</hi> as I wiſh for the ſake of the World he had prevented me in the reſt. I muſt add the Names of Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> and Dr. <hi>Parnell,</hi> tho' I ſhall take a farther Opportunity of doing Juſtice to the laſt, whoſe Good-nature (to give it a great Panegyrick) is no leſs extenſive than his Learning. The Favour of theſe Gentlemen is not entirely undeſerved by one who bears them ſo true an Affection. But what can I ſay of the Honour ſo many of the <hi>Great</hi> have done me, while the <hi>Firſt Names</hi> of the Age appear as my Subſcribers, and the moſt diſtinguiſh'd Patrons and Ornaments of Learning as my chief Encouragers. Among theſe it is a particular Pleaſure to me to find, that my higheſt Obligations are to ſuch who have done moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:40"/>
to the Name of Poet: That his Grace the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was not diſpleas'd I ſhould undertake the Author to whom he has given (in his excellent <hi>Eſſay</hi>) the fineſt Praiſe he ever yet receiv'd.<q>
                  <l>Read <hi>Homer once,</hi> and you can read no more;</l>
                  <l>For all things elſe appear ſo mean and poor,</l>
                  <l>Verſe will ſeem Proſe: yet <hi>often</hi> on him look,</l>
                  <l>And you will hardly need another Book.</l>
               </q> That the Earl of <hi>Halifax</hi> was one of the firſt to favour me, of whom it is hard to ſay whether the Advancement of the Polite Arts is more owing to his Generoſity or his Example. That ſuch a Genius as my Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> not more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in the great Scenes of Buſineſs than in all the uſeful and entertaining Parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has not refus'd to be the Critick of theſe Sheets, and the Patron of their Writer. And that ſo excellent an Imitator of <hi>Homer</hi> as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author of the Tragedy of <hi>Heroic Love,</hi> has continu'd his Partiality to me from my writing Paſtorals to my attempting the <hi>Iliad.</hi> I cannot deny my ſelf the Pride of confeſſing, that I have had the Advantage not only of their Advice for the Conduct in general, but their Correction of ſeveral Particulars of this Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>I could ſay a great deal of the Pleaſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinguiſh'd by the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> but it is almoſt abſurd to particularize any one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:41"/>
Action in a Perſon whoſe whole Life is a continued Series of them. The Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mr. <hi>Stanhope,</hi> the preſent Secretary of State, will pardon my Deſire of having it known that he was pleas'd to promote this Affair. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Zeal of Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> (the Son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave me a Proof how much I am honour'd in a Share of his Friendſhip. I muſt attribute to the ſame Motive that of ſeveral others of my Friends, to whom all Acknowledgments are render'd unneceſſary by the Privileges of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Correſpondence: And I am ſatisfy'd I can no way better oblige Men of their Turn, than by my Silence.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I have found more Patrons than ever <hi>Homer</hi> wanted. He would have thought himſelf happy to have met the ſame Favour at <hi>Athens,</hi> that has been ſhewn me by its learned Rival, the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi> If my Author had the <hi>Wits</hi> of After-Ages for his Defenders, his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator has had the <hi>Beauties</hi> of the preſent for his Advocates; a Pleaſure too great to be changed for any Fame in Reverſion. And I can hardly envy him thoſe pompous Honours he receiv'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, when I reflect on the Enjoyment of ſo many agreeable Obligations, and eaſy Friendſhips which make the Satisfaction of Life. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is the more to be acknowledg'd, as it is ſhewn to one whoſe Pen has never gratify'd the Prejudices of particular <hi>Parties,</hi> or the Vanities of particular <hi>Men.</hi> Whatever the Succeſs may
<pb facs="tcp:0356100101:42"/>
prove, I ſhall never repent of an Undertaking in which I have experienc'd the Candour and Friendſhip of ſo many Perſons of Merit; and in which I hope to paſs ſome of thoſe Years of Youth that are generally loſt in a Circle of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, after a manner neither wholly unuſeful to others, nor diſagreeable to my ſelf.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE, WRITINGS and LEARNING, OF HOMER.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <p>THERE is ſomething in the Mind of Man, which goes beyond bare Curioſity, and even carries us on to a Shadow of Friendſhip with thoſe great Genius's whom we have known to excel in former Ages. Nor will it appear leſs to any one, who conſiders how much it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the Nature of Friendſhip; how it compounds itſelf of an Admiration rais'd by what we meet with concerning them; a Tendency to be farther acquainted with them, by gathering every Circumſtance of their Lives; a kind of Complacency in their Company, when we retire to enjoy what they have left; an Union with them in thoſe Sentiments they approve; and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to defend them, when we think they are injuriouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd, or even ſometimes with too partial an Affection.</p>
               <p>There is alſo in Mankind a Spirit of Envy or Oppoſition, which makes them uneaſy to ſee others of the ſame Species
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0356100101:47"/>
ſeated far above them in a ſort of Perfection. And this, at leaſt ſo far as we ſpeak of the Fame of Writers, has not always been known to dye with a Man entirely, but to purſue his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with idle Traditions, and weak Conjectures; ſo that his Name, which is not to be forgotten, ſhall be preſerv'd only to be ſtain'd and blotted. The Controverſy, which was carry'd on between the Author and his Enemies, while he yet was living, ſhall ſtill be kept on foot; not entirely upon his own account, but on theirs who live after him; ſome being fond to praiſe extravagantly, and others as raſhly eager to contradict his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers. This Proceeding, on both ſides, gives us an Image of the firſt Deſcriptions of War, ſuch as the <hi>Iliad</hi> affords; where a Heroe diſputes the Field with an Army 'til it is his time to dye, and then the Battel, which we expected to fall of courſe, is renew'd about the Body; his Friends contending that they may embalm and honour it, his Enemies that they may caſt it to the Dogs and Vultures.</p>
               <p>There are yet others of a low kind of Taſte, who, without any Malignity to the Character of a great Author, leſſen the Dignity of their Subject by inſiſting too meanly upon little Particularities. They imagine it the Part of an Hiſtorian to omit nothing they meet concerning him whom they write upon; and gather every thing wherein he is nam'd, without any diſtinction, to the Prejudice or Neglect of the more noble Parts of his Character: Like thoſe trifling Painters, or Sculptors, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow infinite Pains and Patience upon the moſt inſignificant Parts of a Figure, 'till they ſink the Grandeur of the Whole, by finiſhing every thing with the neateſt Want of Judgment.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there is a fourth ſort of Men, who pretend to diveſt themſelves of impetuous Emotions on both ſides, and to get above that imperfect Idea of their Subject, which little Writers fall into; who propoſe to themſelves a calm Search after Truth, and a rational Adherence to Probability in their hiſtorical Collections: Who neither wiſh to be led into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Poetry, nor are willing to ſupport the Falſehoods of a malignant Criticiſm; but, endeavouring to ſteer in a middle way, have obtain'd a Character of failing leaſt in the Choice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for Hiſtory, even from the darkeſt Ages.</p>

Being therefore to write ſomething concerning a Life, which there is little Proſpect of our knowing, after it has been the fruitleſs Enquiry of ſo many Ages, and which has however been thus differently treated by Hiſtorians, I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak of it, not as a Certainty, but as the Tradition, Opinion, or Collection of Authors, who have been ſuppos'd to write of <hi>Homer</hi> in theſe four preceding Methods, to which we ſhall alſo add ſome farther Conjectures of our own. After his Life has been thus rather ſpoken of than diſcover'd, I ſhall conſider him hiſtorically as an Author, with regard to thoſe Works which he has left behind him: In doing which, we may trace the degrees of Eſteem they have obtain'd in different Periods of Time, and regulate our preſent Opinion of them, by a View of that Age in which they were written.</p>

If we take a View of <hi>Homer</hi> in thoſe fabulous Traditions which the Admiration of the ancient Heathens has occaſion'd, we find them running to Superſtition, and multiply'd and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on one another, in the different Accounts which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with reſpect to <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> the two native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of Fable.</p>

One would think a Story of this Nature, ſo fit for Age to talk of, and Infancy to hear, were incapable of being handed down to us. But we find the Tradition again taken up to be heighten'd in one part, and carry'd forward in another. <note n="b" place="bottom">Heliod. Aethiop. <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the extravagant Stories by which Men, who have not been able to expreſs how much they admire him, tranſcend the Bounds of Probability to ſay ſomething extraordinary. The Mind, that becomes dazled with the Sight of his Performances, loſes the common Idea of a Man in the fanſy'd Splendor of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: It ſees nothing leſs than a God worthy to be his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nothing leſs than a Propheteſs deſerving to be his Nurſe, and, growing unwilling that he ſhould be ſpoken of in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage beneath its Imaginations, delivers Fables in the place of Hiſtory.</p>

Their Fanſie roſe with a Refinement above what we are ſuppos'd to have of their Maſters, and frequently the Veil of Fiction is wrought fine enough to be ſeen through, ſo that it hardly hides the Meaning it is made to cover, from the firſt Glance of the Imagination.

                  </p>
                  <p>Here we behold a wonderful Genealogy contriv'd induſtriouſly to raiſe our Idea to the higheſt, where Gods, Goddeſſes, Muſes, Kings, and Poets link in a deſcent; nay, where Poets are made to depend, as it were, in Cluſters upon the ſame Stalk beneath one another. If we conſider too that <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> is deriv'd from Harmony, <hi>Philoterpus</hi> from love of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>Euphemus</hi> from beautiful Diction, <hi>Epiphrades</hi> from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and <hi>Pucamede</hi> from Prudence; it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, but the Inventors meant, by a Fiction of this Nature, to turn ſuch Qualifications into Perſons as were agreeable to his Character, for whom the Line was drawn: So that every thing, Divine or Great, will thus come together by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Indulgence of Fancy, while it turns itſelf ſometimes to Admiration, and ſometimes to Allegory.</p>
                  <p>After this fabulous Tree of his Pedigree, we may regularly view him in one Paſſage concerning his Birth, which, though it differs in a Circumſtance from what has been here deliver'd, yet carries on the ſame Air, and regards the ſame Traditions. There is a ſhort Life of <hi>Homer</hi> attributed to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> wherein a third part of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> on Poetry, which is now loſt, is quoted for an account of his uncommon Birth, in this manner. <q rend="inline">"At the time when <hi>Neleus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Codrus,</hi> led the Colony which was ſent into <hi>Ionia,</hi> there was in the Iſland of <hi>Io</hi> a young Girl, compreſs'd by a <hi>Genius,</hi> who delighted to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and ſhare in their Conſorts. She, finding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0356100101:51"/>
herſelf with Child, and being touch'd with the Shame of what had happen'd to her, remov'd from thence to a Place call'd <hi>Aegina.</hi> There ſhe was taken in an Excurſion made by Robbers, and being brought to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Lydians,</hi> they gave her to <hi>Maeon</hi> the King, who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd her upon account of her Beauty. But while ſhe walk'd on the Bank of the River <hi>Meles,</hi> ſhe brought forth <hi>Homer</hi> and expir'd. The Infant was taken by <hi>Maeon,</hi> and bred up as his Son, 'till the Death of that Prince."</q> And from this Point of the Story the Poet is let down into his traditional Poverty. Here we ſee, tho' he be taken out of the Lineage of <hi>Meles</hi> where we met him before, he has ſtill as wonderful a Riſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for him; he is ſtill to ſpring from a <hi>Demigod,</hi> one who was of a Poetical Diſpoſition, from whom he might inherit a Soul turn'd to Poetry, and receive an Aſſiſtance of heavenly Inſpiration.</p>
                  <p>In his Life the moſt general Tradition concerning him is his <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> yet there are ſome who will not allow even this to have happen'd after the manner in which it falls upon other Men: Chance and Sickneſs are excluded; nothing leſs than Gods and Heroes muſt be viſibly concern'd about him. Thus we find among the different Accounts which <note n="e" place="bottom">Hermias <hi>in Phaed. Plat.</hi> Leo Allat. <hi>de Patr. Hom. C.</hi>

                     <hi>Hermias</hi> has collected concerning his Blindneſs, that when <hi>Homer</hi> reſolv'd to write of <hi>Achilles,</hi> he had an exceeding Deſire to fill his Mind with a juſt Idea of ſo glorious a Heroe: Wherefore, having paid all due Honours at his Tomb, he intreats that he may obtain a ſight of him. The Heroe grants his Poet's Petition, and riſes in a glorious Suit of Armour, which caſt ſo unſufferable a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, that <hi>Homer</hi> loſt his Eyes, while he gaz'd for the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Notions.</p>
                  <p>If this be any thing more than a meer Fable, one would be apt to imagine it inſinuated his contracting a Blindneſs by too intenſe an Application while he wrote his <hi>Iliad.</hi> But it is a very pompous way of letting us into the Knowledge of ſo ſhort a Truth: It looks as if Men imagin'd the Lives of Poets ſhould be Poetically written; that to ſpeak plainly of them, were to ſpeak contemptibly; or that we debaſe them, when they are

plac'd in leſs glorious Company than thoſe exalted Spirits which they themſelves have been fond to celebrate. We may however in ſome meaſure be reconcil'd to this laſt idle Fable, for having occaſion'd ſo beautiful an <hi>Epiſode</hi> in the <hi>Ambra</hi> of <hi>Politian.</hi> That which does not inform us in a Hiſtory, may pleaſe us in its proper Sphere of Poetry.</p>

Such Stories as theſe have been the Effects of a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Fondneſs, and of our Aſtoniſhment at what we conſider in a View of Perfection. But neither have all Men the ſame Taſte, nor do they equally ſubmit to the Superiority of others, nor bear that human Nature, which they know to be imperfect, ſhould be prais'd in an Extream without oppoſition. From ſome Principles of this kind have ariſen a ſecond ſort of Stories, which glance at <hi>Homer</hi> with malignant Suppoſitions, and endeavour to throw a diminiſhing Air over his Life, as a kind of Anſwer to thoſe who ſought to aggrandize him injudiciouſly.</p>
                  <p>Under this Head we may reckon thoſe ungrounded Conjectures with which his Adverſaries aſperſe the very Deſign and Proſecution of his Travels, when they inſinuate, that they were one continued Search after Authors who had written before him, and particularly upon the ſame Subject, in order to deſtroy them, or to rob them of their Inventions.</p>
                  <p>Thus we read in <note n="f" place="bottom">Diod. Sic. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note>

The next Inſinuation we hear is from <hi>Suidas,</hi> that <hi>Palamedes,</hi> who fought at <hi>Troy,</hi> was famous for Poetry, and wrote concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that War in the <hi>Dorick</hi> Letter which he invented, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly much againſt <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> his mortal Enemies. Upon this Account ſome have fancy'd his Works were ſuppreſs'd by <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Poſterity, or that their entire Deſtruction was contriv'd and effected by <hi>Homer</hi> when he undertook the ſame Subject. But ſurely the Works of ſo conſiderable a Man, when they had been able to bear up ſo long a time as that which paſs'd between the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the flouriſhing of <hi>Homer,</hi> muſt have been too much diſpers'd, for one of ſo mean a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as he is repreſented, to have deſtroy'd in every place, tho' he had been never ſo much aſſiſted by the vigilant Temper of Envy. And we may ſay too, that what might have been capable of raiſing this Principle in him, muſt be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome meaſure eſteem'd, and of having at leaſt one Line of it preſerv'd to us.</p>
                  <p>After him, in the order of time, we meet with a whole Set of Names, to whom the Maligners of <hi>Homer</hi> would have him oblig'd, without being able to prove their Aſſertion. <hi>Suidas</hi> mentions <hi>Corinnus Ilienſis,</hi> the Secretary of <hi>Palamedes,</hi> who writ a Poem upon the ſame Subject, but no one is produc'd as having ſeen it. <note n="g" place="bottom">Tzetzes <hi>Chil.</hi> 5. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 29.</note>
                     <hi>Tzetzes</hi> mentions (and from <hi>Johannes Melala</hi> only) <hi>Siſyphus</hi> the <hi>Coan,</hi> Secretary of <hi>Teucer,</hi> but it is not ſo much as known if he writ Verſe or Proſe.

                  <p>To anſwer this Story, we take notice that <hi>Heſiod</hi> is generally plac'd after <hi>Homer. Graevius,</hi> his own Commentator, ſets him a hundred Years lower; and whether he were ſo or no, yet <note n="r" place="bottom">Plut. <hi>Symp. l.</hi> 5. §. 2.</note>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> has ſlightly paſs'd the whole Account as a Fable. Nay, we may draw an Argument againſt it from <hi>Heſiod</hi> himſelf: He had a Love of Fame which caus'd him to engage at the Funeral Games, and which went ſo far as to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord his Conqueſt in his own Works; Had he defeated <hi>Homer,</hi> the ſame Principle would have made him mention a Name that could have ſecur'd his own to Immortality. A Poet who records his Glory, would not omit the nobleſt Circumſtance, and <hi>Homer,</hi> like a Captive Prince, had certainly grac'd the Triumph of his Adverſary.</p>
                  <p>Towards the latter end of his Life, there is another Story invented, which makes him conclude it in a manner alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beneath the Greatneſs of a Genius. We find in the Life ſaid to be written by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> a Tradition, <q rend="inline">"That he was warn'd by an Oracle to beware of the young Mens Riddle.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0356100101:58"/>
himſelf; nay, it is but ſuch an one as they commonly do lead, the higheſt Stage of which is to be <hi>Maſter of a School.</hi> But becauſe this is a Treatiſe to which Writers have had recourſe for want of a better, I ſhall give the following Abſtract.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> was born at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> about one hundred ſixty eight Years after the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> and ſix hundred twenty two Years before the <hi>Expedition</hi> of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> His Mother's Name was <hi>Crytheis,</hi> who proving unlawfully with Child, was ſent away from <hi>Cumae</hi> by her Uncle, with <hi>Iſmenias,</hi> one of thoſe who led the Colony to <hi>Smyrna</hi> then building. A while after, as ſhe was celebrating a Feſtival with other Women on the Banks of the River <hi>Meles,</hi> ſhe was deliver'd of <hi>Homer,</hi> whom ſhe therefore nam'd <hi>Meleſigenes.</hi> Upon this ſhe left <hi>Iſmenias,</hi> and ſupported herſelf by Working, 'til <hi>Phemius</hi> (who taught a School in <hi>Smyrna</hi>) fell in love with her, and marry'd her. But both dying in proceſs of Time, the School fell to <hi>Homer,</hi> who manag'd it with ſuch Wiſdom, that he was univerſally admir'd both by Natives and Strangers. Amongſt theſe latter was <hi>Mentes,</hi> a Maſter of a Ship from <hi>Leucadia,</hi> by whoſe Perſuaſions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he gave up his School, and went to travel: With him he viſited <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but was left behind at <hi>Ithaca</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Defluxion in his Eyes. During his Stay he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by one <hi>Mentor,</hi> a Man of Fortune, Juſtice, and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and learn'd the principal Incidents of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>'s Life. But at the Return of <hi>Mentes,</hi> he went from thence to <hi>Colophon,</hi> where, his Defluxion renewing, he fell entirely blind. Upon this he could think of no better Expedient than to go back to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where perhaps he might be ſupported by thoſe who knew him, and have the leiſure to addict himſelf to Poetry. But there he found his Poverty encreaſe, and his hopes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement fail; ſo that he remov'd for <hi>Cumae,</hi> and by the way was entertain'd for ſome time at the Houſe of one <hi>Tychius</hi> a Leather-Dreſſer. At <hi>Cumae</hi> his Poems were wonderfully admir'd, but when he propos'd to eternize their Town if they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a Sallary, he was anſwer'd, That there would be no end of maintaining all the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>blind Men,</hi> and hence he got the Name of <hi>Homer.</hi> From <hi>Cumae</hi> he went to <hi>Phocaea,</hi> where one <hi>Theſtorides</hi> (a School-maſter alſo) offer'd to maintain him if he would ſuffer him to tranſcribe his Verſes: This <hi>Homer</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0356100101:59"/>
complying with for meer Neceſſity, the other had no ſooner gotten them, but he remov'd to <hi>Chois;</hi> There the Poems gain'd him Wealth and Honour, while the Author himſelf hardly earn'd his Bread by repeating them. At laſt, ſome who came from <hi>Chios</hi> having told the People that the ſame Verſes were publiſh'd there by a School-maſter, <hi>Homer</hi> reſolv'd to find him out. Having therefore landed near that Place, he was receiv'd by one <hi>Glaucus</hi> a Shepherd (at whoſe Door he had like to have been worried by Dogs) and carry'd by him to his Maſter at <hi>Bolliſſus,</hi> who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Knowledge, entruſted him with the Education of his Children. Here his Praiſe began to ſpread, and <hi>Theſtorides,</hi> who heard of his Neighbourhood, fled before him. He remov'd however ſome time afterwards to <hi>Chois,</hi> where he ſet up a School of Poetry, gain'd a competent Fortune, marry'd a Wife, and had two Daughters, the one of which dy'd young, the other was marry'd to his Patron at <hi>Bolliſſus.</hi> Here he inſerted in his Poems the Names of thoſe to whom he had been moſt oblig'd, as, <hi>Mentes, Phemius, Mentor,</hi> and <hi>Tychius:</hi> and reſolving for <hi>Athens,</hi> he made honourable mention of that City, to prepare the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> for a kind Reception. But as he went, the Ship put in at <hi>Samos,</hi> where he continu'd the whole Winter, ſinging at the Houſes of great Men, with a Train of Boys after him. In Spring he went on board again in order to proſecute his Journey to <hi>Athens,</hi> but landing by the way at <hi>Ios,</hi> he fell ſick, dy'd, and was bury'd on the Sea-Shore.</p>
                  <p>This is the Life of <hi>Homer</hi> aſcrib'd to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> tho' it is wonderful it ſhould be ſo, ſince it evidently contradicts his own <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> by placing <hi>Homer</hi> ſix hundred twenty two Years before the Expedition of <hi>Xerxes;</hi> whereas <hi>Herodotus</hi> himſelf, who was alive at the time of that Expedition, ſays <hi>Homer</hi> was only <note n="s" place="bottom">Herod. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note>four hundred Years before him. However, if we can imagin that there may be any thing of Truth in the main Parts of this Treatiſe, we may gather theſe general Obſervations from it: That he ſhew'd a great Thirſt of Knowledge, by undertaking ſuch long and numerous Travels; That he manifeſted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled Vigor of Mind, by being able to write with more Fire under the Diſadvantages of Blindneſs, and the utmoſt Poverty,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0356100101:60"/>
than any Poet after him in better Circumſtances; And that he had an unlimited Senſe of Fame (the Attendant of noble Spirits) which prompted him to engage in new Travels, both under theſe Diſadvantages, and the additional Burthen of old Age.</p>
                  <p>But it will not perhaps be either improper or difficult to make ſome Conjectures, which ſeem to lay open the Foundation from whence the Traditions which frame the low Lives of <hi>Homer</hi> have ariſen. In the firſt place we may conſider, That there are no Hiſtorians of his Time (or none handed down to us) who have mention'd him; and that he has never ſpoken plainly of himſelf, in thoſe Works which have been aſcrib'd to him without Controverſy. However, an eager Deſire to know ſomething concerning him has occaſion'd Mankind to labour the Point under theſe Diſadvantages, and turn on all Hands to ſee if there were any thing left which might have the leaſt Appearance of Information. Upon the Search, they find no Remains but his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> and reſolve to torture theſe upon the Rack of Invention, in order to give ſome account of the Perſon they belong to.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Thing therefore they ſettle is, That what paſs'd for his <hi>Name,</hi> muſt be his <hi>Name</hi> no longer, but an <hi>additional Title</hi> us'd inſtead of it. The reaſon why it was given, muſt be ſome Accident of his Life. Having thus found an end of the Clue, they proceed to conſider every thing that the word may imply by its Derivation. One finds that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p>However, the <hi>Name</hi> itſelf not affording enough to furniſh out a whole Life, his <hi>Works</hi> muſt be brought in for Aſſiſtance, and it is taken for granted, That where he has not ſpoken of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he lies veil'd beneath the Perſons or Actions of thoſe whom he deſcribes.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0356100101:68"/>
                     <hi>Greece.</hi> And if others have believ'd he was an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> from his Knowledge of their Rites and Traditions which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd but to few; and of the Arts and Cuſtoms which were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd among them in general; it may prove at leaſt thus much, that he was there in his Travels.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Greece</hi> was in all Probability his native Country, and had then began to make an Effort for Learning, we cannot doubt but he travel'd there alſo, with a particular Obſervation. He uſes the different <hi>Dialects</hi> which were ſpoken in its different Parts, as one who had been converſant with them all. But the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which appears moſt irrefragable, is to be taken from his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue</hi> of the <hi>Ships:</hi> He has there given us an exact <hi>Geography</hi> of <hi>Greece;</hi> where its Cities, Mountains, and Plains, are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mention'd; where the Courſes of its Rivers are trac'd out; where the Countrys are laid in order, their Bounds aſſign'd, and the uſes of their Soils ſpecify'd; which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, who compar'd it with the Original, have allow'd to be ſo true in all Points, that it could never have been owing to a looſe and caſual Information. Even <hi>Strabo</hi>'s Account of <hi>Greece</hi> is but a kind of Commentary upon <hi>Homer</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>We may carry this Argument farther, to ſuppoſe his having been round <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> from his exact Diviſion of the <hi>Regnum Priami vetus</hi> (as <hi>Horace</hi> calls it) into its ſeparate <hi>Dynaſties,</hi> and the Account he gives of the bordering Nations in Alliance with it. Perhaps too, in the Wandrings of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> about <hi>Sicily,</hi> whoſe Ports and neighbouring Iſlands are mention'd, he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to ſend his Heroe where he had made his own Voyage before. Nor will the Fables he has intermingled be any Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his having travel'd in thoſe Parts, ſince they are not related as the Hiſtory of the preſent time, but the Tradition of the former. His mention of <hi>Thrace,</hi> his Deſcription of the Beaſts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and of the Climate in the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands,</hi> may ſeem alſo to give us a view of him in the Extreams of the Earth, where it was not barbarous or uninhabited. It is hard to ſet limits to the Travels of a Man, who has ſet none to that deſire of Knowledge which made him undertake them. Who can ſay what People he has not ſeen, who appears to be vers'd in the Cuſtoms of all? He takes the Globe for the Scene in which he introduces his Subjects; he launches forward intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0356100101:69"/>
like one to whom no place is new, and appears a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of the World in general.</p>
                  <p>When he return'd from his Travels, he ſeems to have apply'd himſelf to the finiſhing his Poems, however he might have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign'd, begun, or purſu'd them before. In theſe he has treaſur'd up his various Acquiſitions of Knowledge, where they have been preſerv'd through Ages, to be as well the Proofs of his own Induſtry, as the Inſtructions of Poſterity. He might then deſcribe his Sacrifices after the <hi>Aeolian</hi> manner; or <note n="k" place="bottom">Iliad 3.</note>his Leagues with a Mixture of <hi>Trojan</hi> and <hi>Spartan</hi> Ceremonies: <note n="l" place="bottom">Il. 2. ℣. 145.</note>He could then compare the Confuſion of a Multitude to that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult he had obſerv'd in the <hi>Icarian</hi> Sea, daſhing and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among its Crowd of Iſlands: He could repreſent the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an Army, by thoſe Flocks of <note n="m" place="bottom">Iliad 2. ℣. 461.</note>Swans he had ſeen on the Banks of the <hi>Cayſter;</hi> or being to deſcribe that Heat of Battel with which <hi>Achilles</hi> drove the <hi>Trojans</hi> into the River, <note n="n" place="bottom">Il. 21. ℣. 12.</note>he could illuſtrate it with an Alluſion from <hi>Cyrene</hi> or <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where, when the Inhabitants burn'd their Fields, the Graſs-hoppers fled before the Fire to periſh in the Ocean. His Fancy being fully repleniſh'd, might ſupply him with every proper occaſional Image, and his Soul after having enlarg'd itſelf, and taken in an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Variety of the Creation, might be equal to the Task of an <hi>Iliad</hi> and an <hi>Odyſſes.</hi>

If this be true, how much a nobler Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation does it give of him, and indeed more agreeable to what we conceive of this mighty Genius, than thoſe ſpurious Accounts which keep him down among the meaneſt of Mankind? What an Idea could we frame to our ſelves of a Converſation, held between two Perſons ſo conſiderable; a Philoſopher conſcious of the Force of Poetry, and a Poet knowing in the Depths of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0356100101:70"/>
Philoſophy; both their Souls improv'd with Learning, both emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently rais'd above little Deſigns, or the meaner kind of Intereſt, and meeting together to conſult the Good of Mankind? But in this, I have only indulg'd a Thought which is not to be inſiſted upon; the Evidence of Hiſtory rather tends to prove that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> brought his Works from <hi>Aſia</hi> after his Death: which <note n="p" place="bottom">Procl. <hi>vitâ</hi> Hom.</note>

                        <hi>His</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter <hi>and</hi> Manners.</note> If we would now make a Conjecture concerning the Genius and Temper of this great Man; perhaps his Works, which would not furniſh us with Facts for his Life, will be more reaſonably made uſe of to give us a Picture of his Mind: To this end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may ſuffer the very Name and Notion of a Book to vaniſh for a while, and look upon what is left us as a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, in order to gain an Acquaintance with <hi>Homer.</hi> Perhaps the general Air of his Works will become the general Character of his Genius, and the particular Obſervations give ſome Light to the particular Turns of his Temper. His comprehenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhews that his Soul was not form'd like a narrow Chanel for a ſingle Stream, but as an Expanſe which might receive an Ocean into its Boſom; that he had the ſtrongeſt Deſire of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and an unbounded Curioſity, which made its Advantage of every tranſient Circumſtance, or obvious Accident. His ſolid and ſententious Manner may make us admire him for a Man of Judgment; one who, in the darkeſt Ages, could enter far into a Diſquiſition of human Nature; who, notwithſtanding all the Changes which Governments, Manners, Rites, and even the Notions of Virtue have undergone, could ſtill abound with ſo many Maxims correſpondent to Truth, and Notions applicable to ſo many Sciences. The Fire, which is ſo obſervable in his Poem, as to give every thing the moſt active Appearance, may make us naturally conjecture him to have been of a warm Temper, and lively Behaviour; and the pleaſurable Air which every where overſpreads it, may give us reaſon to think, that Fire of Imagination was temper'd with Sweetneſs and Affability. If we farther obſerve the Particulars he treats of, and imagine that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0356100101:71"/>
he laid a Streſs upon the Sentiments he delivers, purſuant to his real Opinions; we ſhall take him to be of a religious Spirit, by his inculcating in almoſt every Page the worſhip of the Gods. We ſhall imagine him to be a generous Lover of his Countrey, from his care to extol it every where: which is carry'd to ſuch a heighth, as to make <note n="q" place="bottom">Plutarch <hi>de Aud.

                     </note>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerve, That though many of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> are made Priſoners or Suppliants, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe diſgraceful Accidents (which are common to all Nations in War) ever happens to one <hi>Greek</hi> throughout his Works. We ſhall take him to be a compaſſionate Lover of Mankind, from his numberleſs Praiſes of Hoſpitality and Charity; (if indeed we are not to account for 'em, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Writers of his Life imagine, from his owing his Support to theſe Virtues.) It might ſeem from his Love of Stories, with his manner of telling them ſometimes, that he gave his own Picture when he painted his <hi>Neſtor,</hi> and, as wiſe as he was, was no Enemy to Talking. One would think from his Praiſes of Wine, his copious Goblets, and pleaſing Deſcriptions of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, that he was addicted to a chearful, ſociable Life, which <hi>Horace</hi> takes notice of as a kind of Tradition;

And that he was not (as may be gueſs'd of <hi>Virgil</hi> from his Works) averſe to the <hi>Female Sex,</hi> will appear from his care to paint them amiably upon all occaſions: His <hi>Andromache</hi> and <hi>Penelope</hi> are in each of his Poems moſt ſhining Characters of conjugal Affection; even his <hi>Helena</hi> herſelf is drawn with all the Softnings imaginable; his Souldiers are exhorted to combat with the hopes of <hi>Women;</hi> his Commanders are furniſh'd with <hi>fair Slaves</hi> in their Tents, nor is the venerable <hi>Neſtor</hi> without a <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that in this way of turning a <hi>Book</hi> into a <hi>Man,</hi> this reaſoning from his Works to himſelf, we can at beſt but hit off a few Out-ſtrokes of a Character: Wherefore I ſhall decline the carrying it into more minute Points, and conclude with one <hi>Diſcovery</hi> which we may make from his <hi>Silence,</hi> a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery extreamly proper to be made in this manner, which is, that he was of a very modeſt Temper. There is in all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0356100101:72"/>
other Poets a Cuſtom of ſpeaking of themſelves, and a Vanity of promiſing Eternity to their Writings: In both which <hi>Homer,</hi> who has the beſt Title to ſpeak out, is altogether ſilent. As to the laſt of them, the World has made him am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Recompence; it has given him that Eternity he would not promiſe himſelf: But whatever Endeavours have been offer'd in reſpect of the former, we find our ſelves ſtill under an irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loſs. That which others have ſaid of him has amounted to no more than Conjecture; that which I have ſaid is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be inſiſted on: I have us'd the liberty which is indulg'd me by Precedent, to give in my Opinions among the Accounts of others, and the World may be pleas'd to receive them as ſo many willing Endeavours to gratify its Curioſity.</p>

               <p>HAVING now finiſh'd what was propos'd concerning the Hiſtory of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Life, I ſhall proceed to that of his Works; and conſidering him no longer as a <hi>Man,</hi> but as an <hi>Author,</hi> proſecute the Thread of his Story in this his ſecond Life, thro' the different Degrees of Eſteem which thoſe Writings have obtain'd in different Periods of Time.</p>
               <p>It has been the fortune of ſeveral great Genius's not to be known while they liv'd, either for want of Hiſtorians, the Meanneſs of Fortune, or the Love of Retirement, to which a Poetical Temper is peculiarly addicted. Yet after Death their Works give themſelves a Life in Fame, without the help of an Hiſtorian; and, notwithſtanding the Meanneſs of their Author, or his Love of Retreat, they go forth among Mankind, the Glories of that Age which produc'd them, and the Delight of thoſe which follow it. This is a Fate particularly verify'd in <hi>Homer,</hi> than whom no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Author is leſs known as to himſelf, or more highly valu'd as to his Productions.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"There he had the firſt ſight of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Works, which were probably preſerv'd by the Grand-children of <hi>Creophilus;</hi> and having obſerv'd that their pleaſurable Air of Fiction did not hinder the Poets abounding in Maxims of State, and Rules of Morality, he tranſcrib'd and carry'd with him that entire Collection we have now among us: For at that time (continues this Author) there was only an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Rumour in <hi>Greece</hi> to the Reputation of theſe Poems, and but a few ſcatter'd Fragments handed about, 'till <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> publiſh'd them entire."</q> Thus they were in danger of being loſt as ſoon as they were produced, by the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Age, a want of Taſte in Learning, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0356100101:77"/>
in which they were left to Poſterity, when they fell into the Hands of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> He was a Man of great Learning, a Law-giver to a People divided and untractable, and one who had a Notion that Poetry influenc'd and civiliz'd the Minds of Men; which made him ſmooth the way to his Conſtitution by the Songs of <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Cretan,</hi> whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to write upon Obedience and Concord. As he propos'd to himſelf that the Conſtitution he would raiſe upon this their Union ſhould be of a martial Nature, theſe Poems were of an extraordinary Value to him: for they came with a full Force into his Scheme; the Moral they inſpir'd was Unity; the Air they breath'd was Martial; and their Story had this particular Engagement for the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that it ſhew'd <hi>Greece</hi> in War, and <hi>Aſia</hi> ſubdu'd under the Conduct of one of their own Monarchs, who commanded all the <hi>Graecian</hi> Princes. Thus the Poet both pleas'd the Law-giver, and the People: from whence he had a double Influence when the Laws were ſettled. For his Poem then became a Panegyrick on their Conſtitution, as well as a Regiſter of their Glory; and confirm'd them in the Love of it by a gallant Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of thoſe Qualities and Actions for which it was adapted.

                  <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> has imagin'd, becauſe the Son publiſh'd the Copy more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: This he offers, to reconcile ſo great a Teſtimony as <hi>Plato</hi>'s to the Cloud of Witneſſes which are againſt him in it: But be that as it will, <hi>Athens</hi> ſtill claims its proper Honour of reſcuing the Father of Learning from the Injuries of Time, of having reſtor'd <hi>Homer</hi> to himſelf, and given the World a view of him in his Perfection. So that if his Verſes were before admir'd for their <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> as the <hi>Stars</hi> were before they were conſider'd in a <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Science; they are now admir'd much more for their graceful <hi>Harmony,</hi> and that <hi>Sphere</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> in which they appear to move.

Nor was the Name of <hi>Poet</hi> then in being, or once us'd throughout <hi>Homer</hi>'s Works. From this poor State of Poetry, he has taken a handle to uſher it into the World with the boldeſt Stroke of Praiſe which has ever been given it. It is in the eighth <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> where <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> puts <hi>Demodocus</hi> upon a trial of Skill. <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docus</hi> having diverted the Gueſts with ſome Actions of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; <q rend="inline">"<note n="b" place="bottom">Odyſſ. <hi>l.</hi> 8. ℣. 487, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Thus much therefore we gather from himſelf concerning the moſt ancient State of Poetry in <hi>Greece;</hi> that no one was honour'd with the Name of Poet, before Him whom it has eſpecially belong'd to ever after.

Whatever was ſerious or magnificent made a part of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: War and Peace were the comprehenſive Diviſion in which he conſider'd the World; and the Plans of his Poems were founded on the moſt active Scenes of each, the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a Siege, and the Accidents of a Voyage. For theſe his Spirit was equally active and various, lofty in Expreſſion, clear in Narration, natural in Deſcription, rapid in Action, abundant in Figures. If ever he appears leſs than himſelf, it is from the Time he writ in; and if he runs into Errors, it is from an Exceſs, rather than a Defect of Genius. Thus he roſe over the Poetical World, ſhining out like a Sun all at once, which if it ſometimes make too <hi>faint</hi> an Appearance, 'tis to be aſcrib'd only to the neceſſity of the Seaſon that keeps it at a diſtance; and if he is ſometimes too <hi>violent,</hi> we confeſs at the ſame time that we owe all things to his Heat.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Theology.</note> As for his <hi>Theology,</hi> we ſee the Heathen Syſtem entirely follow'd. This was all he could then have to work upon, and where he fails of Truth for want of Revelation he at leaſt ſhows his Knowledge in his own Religion by the Traditions he delivers. But we are now upon a Point to be farther handled, becauſe the greateſt Controverſy concerning the Merit of <hi>Homer</hi> depends upon it. Let us conſider then that there was an Age in <hi>Greece,</hi> when natural Reaſon only diſcover'd there muſt be ſomething ſuperior to us, and Tradition had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd the Notion to a Number of Deities. At this time <hi>Homer</hi> roſe with the fineſt Turn imaginable for Poetry, who deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0356100101:88"/>
to inſtruct Mankind in the manner for which he was moſt adapted, writ Poems wherein he made uſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Gods to give the higheſt Air of Surprize and Veneration to his Writings. He found the Religion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind wrapt up in Fables; it was thought then the eaſieſt way to convey Morals to the People, who were allur'd to Attention by Pleaſure, and aw'd with the Opinion of a hidden Myſtery. Nor was it his Buſineſs when he undertook the Province of a Poet (not of a meer Philoſopher) to be the firſt who ſhould diſcard That which furniſhes Poetry with its moſt beautiful Appearance: and eſpecially ſince the Age he liv'd in, by diſcovering its Taſte, had not only given him Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but even put him under the neceſſity of preſerving it. Whatever therefore he might think of his Gods, he took them as he found them: he brought them into Action accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Notions which were then entertain'd, and in ſome Stories as they were then believ'd; unleſs we imagine that he invented every thing he delivers. Yet there are ſeveral Rays of Truth ſtreaming through all this Darkneſs, in thoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he entertains concerning the Gods; and ſeveral <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> lightly veil'd over, from whence the learned drew new Knowledges, each according to his Power of Penetration and Fancy. But that we may the better comprehend him in all the Parts of this general View, let us extract from him a Scheme of his Religion.</p>
               <p>He has a <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a <hi>Father of Gods and Men,</hi> whom he makes ſupream, and to whom he applies ſeveral Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as Wiſdom, Juſtice, Knowledge, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are eſſentially inherent to the Idea of a God. <note n="f" place="bottom">Iliad 24. ℣. 527.</note>He has given him two <hi>Veſſels,</hi> out of which he diſtributes natural <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> for the Life of Man; he places the Gods in Council round him; he makes <note n="g" place="bottom">Il. 9. ℣. 498.</note>
                  <hi>Prayers</hi> paſs to and fro before him; and Mankind adore him with Sacrifice. But all this grand Appearance, wherein Poetry paid a deference to Reaſon, is daſh'd and mingled with the Imperfection of our Nature; not only with the applying our Paſſions to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being (for Men have always been treated with this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0356100101:89"/>
Complyance to their Notions) but that he is not even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from our common Appetites and Frailties: For he is made to eat, drink, and ſleep: but this his Admirers would imagine to be only a groſſer way of repreſenting a general Notion of Happineſs, becauſe he ſays in one place,<note n="h" place="bottom">Il. 5. ℣. 340.</note> that the Food of the Gods was not of the ſame Nature with ours. But upon the whole, while he endeavour'd to ſpeak of a Deity without a right Information, he was forc'd to take him from that Image he diſcover'd in <hi>Man;</hi> and (like one who being dazled with the Sun in the Heavens, would view him as he is reflected in a River) he has taken off the Impreſſion not only ruffled with the Emotion of our Paſſions, but obſcur'd with the earthy Mixture of our Natures.</p>
               <p>The other Gods have all their Provinces aſſign'd 'em: <q rend="inline">"Every thing has its peculiar Deity, ſays <note n="i" place="bottom">Maxim. Tyrius, <hi>Diſſ.</hi> 16.</note>

In the ſame ſtrong Light he ſhows our Vices when they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Misfortunes, like extraordinary Powers which inflict them upon us, and even our natural Puniſhments are repreſented as Puniſhers themſelves. But when we come to ſee the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they are introduc'd in, they are found feaſting, fighting, wounded by Men, and ſhedding a ſort of Blood; in which his Machines play a little too groſly: the Fable which was admitted to procure the Pleaſure of Surprize, violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Allegory, and it may be loſt labour to ſearch for it in every minute Circumſtance, if indeed it was intended to be there. The main Deſign was however Philoſophical, the Dreſs the Poet's, which is us'd for neceſſity and allow'd to be ornamental. And there will be ſomething ſtill to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in his Defence, if he has both preſerved the grand Moral from being obſcur'd, and adorn'd the Parts of his Works with ſuch Sentiments of the Gods as belong'd to the Age he liv'd

We find too a Notion of the Soul's ſubſiſting after this Life, but for want of Revelation he knows not what to reckon the Happineſs of a future State, to any one who was not deify'd: Which is plain from the Speech of <note n="l" place="bottom">Odyſſ. 11. ℣. 488.</note>

But if he can not be defended in every thing as a Theologiſt, yet we may ſay in reſpect of his Poetry, that he has enrich'd it from Theology with true Sentiments for Profit, adorn'd it with Allegories for Pleaſure, and by uſing ſome Machines which have no farther Significancy or are ſo refin'd as to make it doubted if they have any, he has however produc'd that Character in Poetry which we call the <hi>Marvellous,</hi> and from which the <hi>Agreeable</hi> (according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) is always inſeparable.</p>

Then the inteſtine Broils of <hi>Greece</hi> (which had been diſcontinued during the League) were renew'd upon its Diſſolution.

               <p>Now a Poem coming out at ſo ſeaſonable a Time, with a Moral capable of healing theſe Diſorders by promoting <hi>Union,</hi> we may reaſonably think it was deſign'd for that End to which it is ſo peculiarly adapted.

he lets us into farther Leſſons concerning it. How when his Kings quarrel, their Subjects ſuffer; when they act in Conjunction, Victory attends them. When they meet in Council, Plans are drawn and Proviſions made for future Action; and when in the Field, the Arts of War are deſcrib'd with the greateſt Exactneſs.

                  <note place="margin">Morality.</note> The <hi>Morality</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> could not be perfect while there was a Weakneſs in its Government; Faults in Politicks are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by Faults in Ethicks, and occaſion them in their turn. The Diviſion into ſo many States was the riſe of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Quarrels, whereby Men were bred up in a kind of rough untractable Diſpoſition. Bodily Strength met with the greateſt Honours, becauſe it was daily neceſſary to the Subſiſtence of little Governments; and that headlong Courage which throws itſelf forward to Enterprize and Plunder, was univerſally careſs'd, becauſe it carry'd all things before it.

               <p>In the Proſecution of the Story every Part of it has its Leſſons of Morality: There is brotherly Love in <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Menelaus,</hi> Friendſhip in <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and the Love of his Country in <hi>Hector.</hi> But ſince we have ſpoken of the <hi>Iliad</hi> as more particular for its Politicks, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>Odyſſes</hi> as its Moral is more directly fram'd for Ethicks. It carries the Heroe through a world of Trials both of the dangerous and pleaſurable Nature. It ſhows him firſt under moſt ſurprizing Weights of Adverſity, among Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks and Savages; all theſe he is made to paſs through in the Methods by which it becomes a Man to conquer; a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in ſuffering, and a Preſence of Mind in every Accident. It ſhows him again in another View, tempted with the Baits of idle or unlawful Pleaſures, and then points out the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of being ſafe from them. But if in general we conſider the care our Author has taken to fix his Leſſons of Morality by the Proverbs and Precepts he delivers, we ſhall not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if <hi>Greece</hi> which afterwards gave the Appellation of <hi>Wiſe</hi> to Men who ſettled <hi>ſingle Sentences</hi> of Truth, ſhould give him the Title of the <hi>Father of Virtue</hi> for introducing ſuch a Number.

               <p>Some indeed have thought notwithſtanding all this, that <hi>Homer</hi> had only a deſign to pleaſe in his Inventions; and that others have ſince extracted Morals out of his Stories (and indeed all Stories are capable of being us'd ſo.) But this is an
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0356100101:94"/>
Opinion concerning Poetry which the World has rather dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into, than begun with. The Traditions of <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s civilizing Mankind by Hymns on the Gods, with others of the like Nature, may ſhow there was a better uſe of the Art both known and practis'd. There is alſo a remarkable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of this kind in the third Book of the <hi>Odyſſes,</hi> that <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> left one of the <note n="p" place="bottom">Odyſſ. 3. ℣. 267.</note>Poets of his Times in the Court when he ſail'd for <hi>Troy;</hi> and that his Queen was preſerv'd virtuous by his Songs, 'till <hi>Aegyſthus</hi> was forc'd to expel him in order to debauch her. Here he has hinted what a true Poetical Spirit can do when apply'd to the Promotion of Virtue; and from this one may judge he could not but deſign That him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he recommends as the Duty and Merit of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Others ſince his Time may have ſeduc'd the Art to worſe Intentions; but they who are offended at the Liberties of ſome Poets, ſhould not judge all in the groſs for trifling or Corruption; eſpecially when the Evidence runs ſo ſtrongly for any One to the contrary.</p>
               <p>We may in general go on to obſerve, that the time when <hi>Homer</hi> was born did not abound in Learning. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Politicks and Morality is weak, it wants its peaceable Air to thrive in, and that Opportunity which is not known in the Ages of unſettled Life. He is himſelf the Man from whom we have the firſt Accounts of Antiquity, either in its Actions or Learning; from whom we hear what <hi>Aegypt</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi> could inform him in, and whatever himſelf could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by the Strength of Nature or Induſtry. But however that we may not miſtake the Elogies of thoſe Ancients who call him the <hi>Father of Arts and Sciences,</hi> and be ſurpriz'd to find ſo little of them (as they are now in Perfection) in his Works; we ſhould know that this Character is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood at large, as if he had included the full and regular Syſtems of every thing: He is to be conſider'd profeſſedly only in Quality of a Poet; this was his Buſineſs, to which, as whatever he knew was to be ſubſervient, ſo he has not fail'd to introduce thoſe Strokes of Knowledge from the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences, which the Subject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

either for Neceſſity or Ornament. This will appear on a fair View of him in each of theſe Lights.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> Before his Time there were no <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> in <hi>Greece:</hi> He treated Hiſtorically of paſt Tranſactions, according as he could be inform'd by Tradition, Song, or whatever Method there was of preſerving their Memory. For this we have the Conſent of Antiquity; they have generally more appeal'd to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and more inſiſted on it than on the Teſtimony of any other Writer, when they treat of the Rites, Cuſtoms, and Manners of the firſt Times.

                     <hi>Strabo,</hi> awaken'd the Conceptions of the eminent Statuaries, while they ſtrove to keep up the Grandeur of that Idea which <hi>Homer</hi> had impreſs'd upon their Imagination; as we read of <hi>Phidias</hi> concerning the Statue of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>"</q> And becauſe they copy'd their Gods from him in their beſt Performances, his Deſcriptions became the <hi>Characters</hi> which were afterwards purſu'd in all Works of a good Taſte. Hence came the common Saying of the Ancients, <q rend="inline">"That either <hi>Homer</hi> was the only Man who had ſeen the Forms of the Gods, or the only one who had ſhown them to Men;"</q> a Paſſage which <note n="h" place="bottom">Dacier, <hi>Preface to</hi> Homer.</note>Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> wreſts to prove the Truth of his Theology, different from <hi>Strabo</hi>'s Acceptation of it.</p>
               <p>There are, beſides what we have ſpoken of, other Sciences pretended to be found in him. Thus <hi>Macrobius</hi> diſcovers that the <hi>Chain</hi> with which <note n="i" place="bottom">Il. 8. ℣. 19. <hi>Vid</hi> Macrob. <hi>de ſomn. Scip. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note>
                  <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſays he could lift the World, is a metaphyſical Notion, that means a Connexion of all Things from the ſupream Being to the meaneſt Part of the Creation. Others, to prove him skilful in judicial Aſtrology, bring a Quotation concerning the Births of <note n="k" place="bottom">Il. 18. ℣. 252.</note>

               <p>It is ſufficient to have gone thus far, in ſhewing he was a Father of Learning, a Soul capable of ranging over the whole Creation with an intellectual View, ſhining alone in an Age of Obſcurity, and ſhining beyond thoſe who have had the Opportunity of more learned Ages; leaving behind him a Work adorn'd with the Knowledge of his own Time, and in which he has before-hand broken up the Fountains of ſeveral Sciences which were brought nearer to Perfection by Poſterity: A Work which ſhall always ſtand at the top of the ſublime Character, to be gaz'd at by Readers with an Admiration of its Perfection, and by Writers with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair that it ſhould ever be emulated with Succeſs.</p>

               <p>IT is ſomething ſtrange that of all the Commentators upon <hi>Homer,</hi> there is hardly one whoſe principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to illuſtrate the Poetical Beauties of the Author. They are voluminous in explaining thoſe Sciences which he made but ſubſervient to his Poetry, and ſparing only upon that Art which conſtitutes his Character. This has been occaſion'd by the Oſtentation of Men who had more Reading than Taſte, and were fonder of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Variety of Learning in all Kinds, than their ſingle Underſtanding in Poetry. Hence it comes to paſs that their Remarks are rather Philoſophical, Hiſtorical, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical, Allegorical, or in ſhort rather any thing than Critical and Poetical. Even the Grammarians, tho' their whole Buſineſs and Uſe be only to render the Words of an Author intelligible, are ſtrangely touch'd with the Pride of doing ſomething more than they ought. The grand Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of one ſort of Scholars is to encreaſe the Number of <hi>Various Lections;</hi> which they have done to ſuch a degree of obſcure Diligence, that we now begin to value the firſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Books as moſt correct, becauſe they have been leaſt corrected. The prevailing Paſſion of others is to diſcover <hi>New Meanings</hi> in an Author, whom they will cauſe to appear myſterious purely for the Vanity of being thought to unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel him. Theſe account it a diſgrace to be of the Opinion of thoſe that preceded them; and it is generally the Fate of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0356100101:142"/>
ſuch People who will never ſay what was ſaid before, to ſay what will never be ſaid after them. If they can but find a Word that has once been ſtrain'd by ſome dark Writer to ſignify any thing different from its uſual Acceptation, it is frequent with them to apply to conſtantly to that uncommon Meaning, whenever they meet it in a clear Writer: For Reading is ſo much dearer to them than Senſe, that they will diſcard it at any time to make way for a Criticiſm. In other Places where they cannot conteſt the Truth of the common Interpretation, they get themſelves room for Diſſertation by imaginary <hi>Amphibologies,</hi> which they will have to be deſign'd by the Author. This Diſpoſition of finding out different Significations in one thing, may be the Effect of either too much, or too little Wit: For Men of a right Underſtanding generally ſee at once all that an Author can reaſonably mean, but others are apt to fancy Two Meanings for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing One. Not to add, that there is a vaſt deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Learning of a Critick, and the Puzzling of a Grammarian.</p>
               <p>It is no eaſy Task to make ſomething out of a hundred Pedants that is not Pedantical; yet this he muſt do, who would give a tolerable Abſtract of the former Expoſitors of <hi>Homer.</hi> The Commentaries of <hi>Euſtathius</hi> are indeed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Treaſury of the <hi>Greek</hi> Learning; but as he ſeems to have amaſſed the Subſtance of whatever others had written upon the Author, ſo he is not free from ſome of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Cenſures. There are thoſe who have ſaid, that a judicious Abſtract of Him alone might furniſh out ſufficient Illuſtrations upon <hi>Homer.</hi> It was reſolv'd to take the trouble of reading thro' that voluminous Work, and the Reader may be aſſur'd, thoſe Remarks that any way concern the Poetry or Art of the Poet, are much fewer than is imagin'd. The greater Part of theſe is already plunder'd by ſucceeding Commentators, who have very little but what they owe to him: and I am oblig'd to ſay even of Madam <hi>Dacier,</hi> that ſhe is either more beholden to him than ſhe has confeſſed, or has read him leſs than ſhe is willing to own. She has made a farther Attempt than her Predeceſſors to diſcover the Beauties of the Poet; tho' we have often only
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0356100101:143"/>

                     <hi>between</hi> Homer <hi>and</hi> Virgil; which is by no means the moſt judicious of his Works. He cavils firſt at the Poet's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting ſo much upon the Effects of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Anger, That it was <q rend="inline">"the Cauſe of the Woes of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>"</q>  that it <q rend="inline">"ſent ſo many Heroes to the Shades,"</q>  that <q rend="inline">"their Bodies were left a Prey to Birds and Beaſts,"</q> the firſt of which he thinks had been ſufficient. One may anſwer, that the Woes of <hi>Greece</hi> might conſiſt in ſeveral other things than in the Death of her He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, which was therefore needful to be ſpecify'd: As to the Bodies, he might have reflected how great a Curſe the want of Burial was accounted by the Ancients, and how prejudicial it was eſteem'd even to the Souls of the deceas'd: We have a moſt particular Example of the Strength of this Opinion from the Conduct of <hi>Sophocles</hi> in his <hi>Ajax;</hi> who thought this very Point ſufficient to make the Diſtreſs of the laſt Act of that Tragedy after the Death of his Heroe, purely to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Audience that he obtain'd the Rites of Sepulture. Next he objects it as prepoſterous in <hi>Homer</hi> to deſire the Muſe to tell him the whole Story, and at the ſame time to inform her ſolemnly in his own Perſon that 'twas the <hi>Will of Jove</hi> which brought it about. But is a Poet then to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd intirely ignorant of his Subject, tho' he invokes the Muſe to relate the Particulars? May not <hi>Homer</hi> be allow'd the Knowledge of ſo plain a Truth, as that the Will of God is fulfill'd in all things? Nor does his Manner of ſaying this infer that he <hi>informs</hi> the Muſe of it, but only correſponds with the uſual way of deſiring Information from another concerning any thing, and at the ſame time mentioning that little we know of it in general. What is there more in this Paſſage? <q rend="inline">"Sing, O Goddeſs, that Wrath of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which prov'd ſo pernicious to the <hi>Greeks:</hi> We only know the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, that it ſent innumerable brave Men to the Shades, and that it was <hi>Jove</hi>'s Will it ſhould be ſo. But tell me, O Muſe, what was the Source of this deſtructive Anger?"</q> I can't apprehend what <hi>Rapin</hi> means by ſaying, it is hard to know where this <hi>Invocation</hi> ends, and that it is confounded with the <hi>Narration,</hi> which ſo manifeſtly begins at <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0356100101:155"/>
might ſhock him in ſeveral Particulars following. We ſhould know that the Poet has rather ſtudy'd Nature than Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the laying down his Characters. He reſolv'd to ſing the Conſequences of Anger; he conſider'd what Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Vices would conduce moſt to bring his Moral out of the Fable; and artfully diſpos'd them in his chief Perſons after the manner in which we generally find them; making the Fault which moſt peculiarly attends any good Quality, to reſide with it. Thus he has plac'd Pride with Magnanimity in <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and Craft with Prudence in <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> And thus we muſt take his <hi>Achilles,</hi> not as a meer heroick diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd Character, but as one compounded of Courage and Anger; one who finds himſelf almoſt invincible, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes an uncontroul'd Carriage upon the Self-conſciouſneſs of his Worth; whoſe high Strain of Honour will not ſuffer him to betray his Friends or fight againſt them, even when he thinks they have affronted him; but whoſe inexorable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment will not let him hearken to any Terms of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. Theſe are the Lights and Shades of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which <hi>Homer</hi> has heighten'd and darkned in Extreams; becauſe on the one ſide Valour is the darling Quality of Epic Poetry, and on the other, Anger the particular Subject of his Poem.

He ſides with neither, that he might not anger any one, while he adviſes them to the proper Methods of Reconciliation; and he appears to ſide with both while he praiſes each, that they may be induc'd by the Recollection of one another's Worth to return to that Amity which would bring Succeſs to the Cauſe. It was not however conſiſtent

with the Plan of the Poem that this ſhould entirely appeaſe them, for then the Anger would be at an end which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be ſung through the whole. <hi>Homer</hi> has not therefore made this Speech to have its full Succeſs; and yet that the Eloquence of his <hi>Neſtor</hi> might not be thrown out of Character by its proving unavailable, he takes care that the Violence with which the Diſpute was manag'd ſhould abate immediately upon his ſpeaking; <hi>Agamemnon</hi> confeſſes that all he ſpoke was right, <hi>Achilles</hi> promiſes not to fight for <hi>Briſeis</hi> if ſhe ſhould be ſent for, and the Council diſſolves.</p>

The foregoing Remark is in regard only to the firſt ſix Lines of this Speech. What follows is a Rehearſal of the preceding Action of the Poem, almoſt in the ſame Words he had uſed in the opening it; and is one of thoſe Faults which has with moſt Juſtice been objected to our Author. It is not to be deny'd but the Account muſt be tedious, of what the Reader had been juſt before inform'd: and eſpecially when we are given to underſtand it was no way neceſſary, by what <hi>Achilles</hi> ſays at the beginning, that <hi>Thetis knew the whole Story already.</hi> As to repeating the ſame Lines, a Practice uſual with <hi>Homer,</hi> it is not ſo excuſable in this Place as in thoſe where Meſſages are deliver'd in the Words they were receiv'd, or the like; it being unnatural to imagine, that the Perſon whom the Poet introduces as actually ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould fall into the ſelf-ſame Words that are us'd in the Narration by the Poet himſelf. Yet <hi>Milton</hi> was ſo great an Admirer and Imitator of our Author, as not to have ſcrupled even this kind of Repetition. The Paſſage is at the end of his tenth Book, where <hi>Adam</hi> having declar'd he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelf before God in certain particular Acts of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, thoſe Acts are immediately after deſcrib'd by the Poet in the ſame Words.</p>

In his ſecond, he had commanded the Soldiers

with Bravery, and made them know what Part they ſuſtain'd in the War. In his third, he had rebuk'd the Seditious in the Perſon of <hi>Therſites,</hi> by Reproofs, Threats, and actual Chaſtiſements. And now in this fourth, when all are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd he applies to them in Topics which equally affect them all: He raiſes their Hearts by putting them in mind of the Promiſes of Heaven, and thoſe Prophecies of which as they had ſeen the Truth in the nine Years Delay, they might now expect the Accompliſhment in the tenth Year's Succeſs: which is a full Anſwer to what <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had ſaid of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s deceiving them.</p>

                  <p>IF we look upon this Piece with an Eye to ancient Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it may be obſerv'd that however fabulous the other Parts of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poem may be according to the Nature of Epic Poetry, this Account of the People, Princes, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is purely Hiſtorical, founded on the real Tranſactions of thoſe Times, and by far the moſt valuable Piece of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Geography left us concerning the State of <hi>Greece</hi> in that early Period. <hi>Greece</hi> was then divided into ſeveral Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſties, which our Author has enumerated under their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Princes; and his Diviſion was look'd upon ſo exact, that we are told of many Controverſies concerning the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of <hi>Graecian</hi> Cities which have been decided upon the Authority of this Piece. <hi>Euſtathius</hi> has collected together the following Inſtances. The City of <hi>Calydon</hi> was adjudg'd to the <hi>Aetolians</hi> notwithſtanding the Pretenſions of <hi>Aeolia,</hi> becauſe <hi>Homer</hi> had rank'd it among the Towns belonging to the former. <hi>Seſtos</hi> was given to thoſe of <hi>Abydos,</hi> upon the Plea that he had ſaid, the <hi>Abydonians</hi> were Poſſeſſors of <hi>Seſtos, Abydos,</hi> and <hi>Arisbe.</hi> When the <hi>Mileſians</hi> and People of <hi>Priene</hi> diſputed their Claim to <hi>Mycale,</hi> a Verſe of <hi>Homer</hi>

carry'd it in favour of the <hi>Mileſians.</hi> And the <hi>Athenians</hi> were put in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Salamis</hi> by another which was cited by <hi>Solon,</hi> or (as ſome think) interpolated by him for that Purpoſe. Nay in ſo high Eſtimation has this Catalogue been held, that (as <hi>Porphyry</hi> has written) there have been Laws in ſome Nations for the Youth to learn it by heart, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Cerdias</hi> (whom <hi>Cuperus de Apoth. Homer.</hi> takes to be <hi>Cercydas</hi> a Law-giver of the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi>) made it one to his Countrymen.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſider the Catalogue purely as poetical, it will not want its Beauties in that Light. <hi>Rapin</hi> who was none of the moſt ſuperſtitious Admirers of our Author, reckons it among thoſe Parts which had particularly charm'd him. We may obſerve firſt, what an Air of Probability is ſpread over the whole Poem by the particularizing of every Nation and People concern'd in this War. Secondly, what an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scene he preſents to us, of ſo many Countries drawn in their livelieſt and moſt natural Colours, while we wander along with him amidſt a beautiful Variety of Towns, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Foreſts, Vineyards, Groves, Mountains, and Rivers, and are perpetually amus'd with his Obſervations on the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Soils, Products, Situations, or Proſpects. Thirdly, what a noble Review he paſſes before us of ſo mighty an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, drawn out in order Troop by Troop; which had the Number only been told in the Groſs, had never fill'd the Reader with ſo great a Notion of the Importance of the Action. Fourthly, the Deſcription of the differing Arms and manner of fighting of the Soldiers, and the various Attitudes he had given to the Commanders: Of theſe Leaders, the greateſt Part are either the immediate Sons of Gods, or the Deſcendants of Gods; and how great an Idea muſt we have of a War, to the waging of which ſo many Demi-Gods and Heroes are aſſembled? Fifthly, the ſeveral artful Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he paid by this means to his own Country in general, and many of his Contemporaries in particular, by a Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Genealogies, ancient Seats, and Dominions of the great Men of his Time. Sixthly, the agreeable Mixture of Narrations from Paſſages of Hiſtory or Fables, with which he amuſes and relieves us at proper Intervals. And laſtly, the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0356100101:256"/>
admirable Judgment wherewith he introduces this whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, juſt at a Time when the Poſture of Affairs in the Army render'd ſuch a Review of abſolute Neceſſity to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and in a Pauſe of Action, while each was refreſhing himſelf to prepare for the enſuing Battels.</p>

                     <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his <hi>Saturnalia, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. has given us a judicious Piece of Criticiſm, in the Compariſon betwixt the Catalogues of <hi>Homer</hi> and of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in which he juſtly allows the Preference to our Author for the following Reaſons. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> (ſays he) has begun his Deſcription from the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Promontory of <hi>Greece</hi> (he means that of <hi>Aulis,</hi> where was the narroweſt Paſſage to <hi>Euboea.</hi>) From thence with a regular Progreſs he deſcribes either the maritime or mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Towns as their Situations are contiguous; he never paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with ſudden Leaps from Place to Place, omitting thoſe which lie between; but proceeding like a Traveller in the way he has begun, conſtantly returns to the Place from whence he digreſs'd, 'till he finiſhes the whole Circle he deſign'd. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> on the contrary has obſerv'd no Order in the Regions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in his Catalogue, <hi>l.</hi> 10. but is perpetually breaking from the Courſe of the Country in a looſe and deſultory manner. You have <hi>Cluſium</hi> and <hi>Coſae</hi> at the beginning, next <hi>Populonia</hi> and <hi>Ilva,</hi> then <hi>Piſae,</hi> which lie at a vaſt diſtance in <hi>Etruria;</hi> and immediately after <hi>Cerete, Pyrgi,</hi> and <hi>Graviſcae,</hi> Places adjacent to <hi>Rome:</hi> From hence he is ſnatch'd to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria,</hi> then to <hi>Mantua.</hi> The ſame Negligence is obſervable in his Enumeration of the Aids that follow'd <hi>Turnus</hi> in <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>Macrobius</hi> next remarks, that whatever Perſons are nam'd by <hi>Homer</hi> in his Catalogue, are afterwards introduc'd in his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and whenever any others are kill'd, he mentions only a Multitude in general. Whereas <hi>Virgil</hi> (he continues) has ſpar'd himſelf the Labour of that Exactneſs; For not only ſeveral whom he mentions in the Liſt are never heard of in the War, but others make a Figure in the War of whom we had no notice in the Liſt. For Example, he ſpecifies a thouſand Men under <hi>Maſſicus</hi> who came from <hi>Cluſium, l.</hi> 10. ℣. 167. <hi>Turnus</hi> ſoon afterwards is in the Ship which had carry'd King <hi>Oſinius</hi> from the ſame Place, <hi>l.</hi> 10. ℣. 655. This <hi>Oſinius</hi> was never nam'd before, nor is it probable a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0356100101:257"/>
King ſhould ſerve under <hi>Maſſicus.</hi> Nor indeed does either <hi>Maſſicus</hi> or <hi>Oſinius</hi> ever make their Appearance in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels—He proceeds to inſtance ſeveral others, who tho' cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for Heroes in the Catalogue, have no farther notice taken of them throughout the Poem. In the third Place he animadverts upon the Confuſion of the ſame Names in <hi>Virgil:</hi> As where <hi>Corinaeus</hi> in the ninth Book is kill'd by <hi>Aſylas,</hi> ℣. 571. and <hi>Corinaeus</hi> in the twelfth kills <hi>Ebuſus,</hi> ℣. 298. <hi>Numa</hi> is ſlain by <hi>Niſus, l.</hi> 9. ℣. 554. and <hi>Aeneas</hi> is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in purſuit of <hi>Numa, l.</hi> 10. ℣. 562. <hi>Aeneas</hi> kills <hi>Camertes</hi> in the tenth Book, ℣. 562. and <hi>Juturna</hi> aſſumes his Shape in the twelfth, ℣. 224. He obſerves the ſame Obſcurity in his <hi>Patronymics.</hi> There is <hi>Palinurus Iaſides,</hi> and <hi>Iapix Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Hippocoon Hyrtacides,</hi> and <hi>Aſylas Hyrtacides.</hi> On the contrary the Caution of <hi>Homer</hi> is remarkable, who having two of the Name of <hi>Ajax</hi> is conſtantly careful to diſtinguiſh them by <hi>Oïleus</hi> or <hi>Telamonius,</hi> the <hi>leſſer</hi> or the <hi>greater Ajax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know nothing to be alledg'd in Defence of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in anſwer to this Author, but the common Excuſe that his <hi>Aeneis</hi> was left unfiniſh'd. And upon the whole, theſe are ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Slips as great Wits may paſs over, and little Criticks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Macrobius</hi> has another Remark which one may accuſe of evident Partiality on the ſide of <hi>Homer.</hi> He blames <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> for having vary'd the Expreſſion in his Catalogue to avoid the Repetition of the ſame Words, and prefers the bare and unadorn'd Reiterations of <hi>Homer;</hi> who begins almoſt every Article the ſame way, and ends perpetually, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perhaps the beſt reaſon to be given for this, had been the artleſs Manner of the firſt Times, when ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions were not thought ungraceful. This may appear from ſeveral of the like Nature in the Scripture; as in the twenty ſixth Chapter of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are enumerated in the Plains of <hi>Moab,</hi> and each Diviſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the ſame Words. So in the ſeventh Chapter of the <hi>Revelations: Of the Tribe of</hi> Gad <hi>were ſealed twelve thouſand, &amp;c.</hi> But the Words of <hi>Macrobius</hi> are <hi>Has copias fortaſſe putat aliquis Divinae illi ſimplicitati praeferendas. Sed neſcio quo modo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merum</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0356100101:258"/>
                     <hi>repetitio illa unicè decet, &amp; eſt genio antiqui Poetae digna.</hi> This is exactly in the Spirit, and almoſt in the Cant of a true modern Critick. The <hi>Simplicitas,</hi> the <hi>Neſcio quo modo,</hi> the <hi>Genio antiqui Poetae digna,</hi> are excellent general Phraſes for thoſe who have no Reaſons. <hi>Simplicity</hi> is our Word of Diſguiſe for a ſhameful unpoetical Neglect of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: The Term of the <hi>Je ne ſçay quoy</hi> is the very Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all ignorant Pretenders to Delicacy; and to lift up our Eyes, and talk of the <hi>Genius of an Ancient,</hi> is at once the cheapeſt way of ſhewing our own Taſte, and the ſhorteſt way of criticizing the Wit of others our Contemporaries.</p>
                  <p>One may add to the foregoing Compariſon of theſe two Authors, ſome Reaſons for the Length of <hi>Homer</hi>'s, and the Shortneſs of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Catalogues. As, that <hi>Homer</hi> might have a Deſign to ſettle the Geography of his Country, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Deſcription of <hi>Greece</hi> before his Days; which was not the Caſe with <hi>Virgil. Homer</hi>'s Concern was to compliment <hi>Greece</hi> at a time when it was divided into many diſtinct States, each of which might expect a Place in his Catalogue: But when all <hi>Italy</hi> was ſwallow'd up in the ſole Dominion of <hi>Rome, Virgil</hi> had only <hi>Rome</hi> to celebrate. <hi>Homer</hi> had a numerous Army, and was to deſcribe an important War with great and various Events; whereas <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Sphere was much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. The Ships of the <hi>Greeks</hi> are computed at about one thouſand two hundred, thoſe of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his Aids but at two and forty; and as the Time of the Action of both Poems is the ſame, we may ſuppoſe the Built of their Ships, and the Number of Men they contain'd, to be much alike. So that if the Army of <hi>Homer</hi> amounts to about a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, that of <hi>Virgil</hi> cannot be above four thouſand. If any one be farther curious to know upon what this Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is founded, he may ſee it in the following Paſſage of <hi>Thucidydes, lib.</hi> 1. <q rend="inline">"<hi>Homer</hi>'s Fleet (ſays he) conſiſted of one thouſand two hundred Veſſels: thoſe of the <hi>Boeotians</hi> carry'd one hundred and twenty Men in each, and thoſe of <hi>Philoctetes</hi> fifty. By theſe I ſuppoſe <hi>Homer</hi> expreſt the largeſt and the ſmalleſt Size of Ships, and therefore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no other ſort. But he tells us of thoſe who ſail'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0356100101:259"/>
with <hi>Philoctetes,</hi> that they ſerv'd both as Mariners and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, in ſaying the Rowers were all of them Archers. From hence the whole Number will be ſeen, if we eſtimate the Ships at a Medium between the greateſt and the leaſt."</q> That is to ſay, at eighty five Men to each Veſſel (which is the Mean between fifty and a hundred and twenty) the Total comes to a hundred and two thouſand Men. <hi>Plutarch</hi> was therefore in a Miſtake when he computed the Men at a hundred and twenty thouſand, which proceeded from his ſuppoſing a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty in every Ship; the contrary to which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the above-mention'd Ships of <hi>Philoctetes,</hi> as well as from thoſe of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which are ſaid to carry but fifty Men a-piece, in the ſixteenth <hi>Iliad,</hi> ℣. 167.</p>
                  <p>Beſides <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Imitation of this Catalogue, there has ſcarce been any Epic Writer but has copy'd after it; which is at leaſt a Proof how beautiful this Part has been ever eſteem'd by the fineſt Genius's in all Ages. The Catalogues in the ancient Poets are generally known, only I muſt take notice that the <hi>Phocian</hi> and <hi>Boeotian</hi> Towns in the fourth <hi>Thebaid</hi> of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> are tranſlated from hence. Of the Moderns, thoſe which moſt excel, owe their Beauty to the Imitation of ſome ſingle Particular only of <hi>Homer.</hi> Thus the chief Grace of <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s Catalogue conſiſts in the Deſcription of the Heroes, without any thing remarkable on the ſide of the Countries: Of the Pieces of Story he has interwoven, that of <hi>Tancred</hi>'s Amour to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> is ill placed, and evidently too long for the reſt. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>'s Enumeration of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Rivers</hi> in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Canto of his fourth Book, is one of the nobleſt in the World; if we conſider his Subject was more confined, and can excuſe his not obſerving the Order or Courſe of the Country; but his Variety of Deſcription, and Fruitfulneſs of Imagination are no where more admirable than in that Part. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Liſt of the fallen Angels in his firſt Book is an exact Imitation of <hi>Homer,</hi> as far as regards the Digreſſions of Hiſtory and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, and his manner of inſerting them: In all elſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it muſt be allow'd inferior. And indeed what <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> has ſaid to caſt <hi>Virgil</hi> below <hi>Homer,</hi> will fall much more ſtrongly upon all the reſt.</p>

I had ſome cauſe to fear that this Catalogue which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſo much to the Succeſs of the Author, ſhould ruin that of the Tranſlator. A meer heap of proper Names tho' but for a few Lines together, could afford little Entertainment to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader, who probably could not be appriz'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Neceſſity or Beauty of this Part of the Poem. There were but two things to be done to give it a chance to pleaſe him; to render the Verſification very flowing and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, and to make the whole appear as much a <hi>Landſcape</hi> or <hi>Piece of Painting</hi> as poſſible. For both of theſe I had the Example of <hi>Homer</hi> in general; and <hi>Virgil,</hi> who found the Neceſſity in another Age to give more into Deſcription, ſeem'd to authoriſe the latter in particular. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarnaſſus</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the <hi>Structure and Diſpoſition of Words,</hi> profeſſes to admire nothing more than that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Exactneſs with which <hi>Homer</hi> has placed theſe Words, and ſoften'd the Syllables into each other, ſo as to derive Muſick from a Croud of Names which have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no Beauty or Dignity. I would flatter my ſelf that I have practis'd this not unſucceſsfully in our Language, which is more ſuſceptible of all the Variety and Power of Numbers than any of the modern, and ſecond to none but the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> For the latter Point, I have ventured to open the Proſpect a little, by the addition of a few Epithets or ſhort Hints of Deſcription to ſome of the Places mention'd; tho' ſeldom exceeding the Compaſs of half a Verſe (the Space to which my Author himſelf generally confines theſe Pictures in Miniature.) But this has never been done without the beſt Authorities from the Ancients, which may be ſeen under the reſpective Names in the Geographical Table following.</p>
                  <p>The Table itſelf I thought but neceſſary to annex to the Map, as my Warrant for the Situations aſſign'd in it to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Towns.

               <p>OF all the Books of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> there is ſcarce any more pleaſing than the Third. It may be divided into five Parts, each of which has a Beauty different from the other. The firſt contains what paſs'd before the two Armies, and the Propoſal of the Combate between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Menelaus:</hi> The Attention and Suſpenſe of theſe mighty Hoſts, which were juſt upon the Point of joining Battel, and the lofty manner of offering and accepting this important and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Challenge, have ſomething in them wonderfully pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and of an amuſing Solemnity. The ſecond Part which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Behaviour of <hi>Helena</hi> in this Juncture, her Conference with the old King and his Counſellors, with the Review of the Heroes from the Battelments, is an Epiſode entirely of another ſort, which excels in the Natural and Pathetick. The third conſiſts of the Ceremonies of the Oath on both ſides and the Preliminaries to the Combate; with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Retreat of <hi>Priam,</hi> who in the Tenderneſs of a Parent withdraws from the ſight of the Duel: Theſe Particulars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Reader in Expectation, and heighten his Impatience for the Fight itſelf. The fourth is the Deſcription of the Duel, an exact Piece of Painting where we ſee every Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Motion, and Action of the Combatants particularly and diſtinctly, and which concludes with a ſurprizing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, in the reſcue of <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Venus.</hi> The Machine of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0356100101:299"/>
that Goddeſs which makes the fifth Part, and whoſe End is to reconcile <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Helena,</hi> is admirable in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; The Remonſtrance ſhe holds with the Goddeſs, the Reluctance with which ſhe obeys her, the Reproaches ſhe caſts upon <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Flattery and Courtſhip with which he ſo ſoon wins her over to him. <hi>Helen</hi> (the main Cauſe of this War) was not to be made an odious Character; She is drawn by this great Maſter with the fineſt Strokes, as a frail, but not an abandon'd Creature. She has perpetual Struggles of Virtue on the one ſide, and Softneſſes which overcome them on the other. Our Author has been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably careful to tell us this; whenever he but ſlightly names her in the foregoing Part of his Work ſhe is repreſented at the ſame time as repentant; and it is thus we ſee her at large at her firſt Appearance in the preſent Book, which is one of the ſhorteſt of the whole <hi>Iliad,</hi> but in recompence has Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties almoſt in every Line, and moſt of them ſo obvious that to acknowledge them we need only to read them.</p>

But as this Obſervation ſeems particularly inſiſted upon by our Author (for he uſes it again in the fourth Book, ℣. 430.) ſo he had a farther Reaſon for it. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Treatiſe of reading the Poets, remarks upon this Diſtinction, as a particular Credit to the military Diſcipline of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And ſeveral ancient Authors tell us, it was the Manner of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to encounter with Shouts and Outcries; as it continues to this Day the Cuſtom of the Eaſtern Nations. Perhaps theſe Clamours were only to encourage their Men, inſtead of martial Inſtruments. I think Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> ſays, there never was a People but made uſe of ſome ſort of Muſick in Battel: <hi>Homer</hi> never

There are ſeveral Reaſons which render <hi>Hector</hi> a favorite Character with every Reader, ſome of which ſhall here be offer'd. The chief Moral of <hi>Homer</hi> was to expoſe the ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Diſcord; the <hi>Greeks</hi> were to be ſhewn diſunited, and to render that Diſunion the more probable, he has deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly given them <hi>mixt</hi> Characters. The <hi>Trojans</hi> on the other hand were to be repreſented making all Advantages of the others Diſagreement, which they could not do without a ſtrict Union among themſelves. <hi>Hector</hi> therefore who commanded them, muſt be endu'd with all ſuch Qualifications as tended to the Preſervation of it; as <hi>Achilles</hi> with ſuch as promoted the contrary.

And indeed it is this Love of his Country which appears his principal Paſſion, and the Motive of all his Actions. He has no other Blemiſh than that he fights in an unjuſt Cauſe, which <hi>Homer</hi> has yet been careful to tell us he would not do, if his Opinion were followed. But ſince he cannot prevail, the Affection he bears to his Parents and Kindred, and his deſire of defending them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites him to do his utmoſt for their Safety. We may add
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0356100101:304"/>
that <hi>Homer</hi> having ſo many <hi>Greeks</hi> to celebrate, makes them ſhine in their turns, and ſingly in their ſeveral Books, one ſucceeding in the Abſence of another: Whereas <hi>Hector</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in every Battel the Life and Soul of his Party, and the conſtant Bulwark againſt every Enemy: He ſtands againſt <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Magnanimity, <hi>Diomed</hi>'s Bravery, <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Strength, and <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Fury.

He who was ſo very particular in the moſt minute Points, can hardly be thought to have been negligent in this. Some Reaſons may be offer'd that they both ſpoke the ſame Language; for the <hi>Trojans</hi> (as may be ſeen in <hi>Dion. Halic. lib.</hi> 1.) were of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Extraction originally. <hi>Dardanus</hi> the firſt of their Kings was born in <hi>Arcadia;</hi> and even their Names were generally <hi>Greek,</hi> as <hi>Hector, Anchiſes, Andromache, Aſtyanax, &amp;c.</hi> Of the laſt of theſe in particular <hi>Homer</hi> gives us a Derivation which is purely <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Il.</hi> 6. ℣. 403.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0356100101:308"/>
the <hi>Laconick;</hi> which the better to comprehend, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member there are in <hi>Homer</hi> three Speakers of different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, agreeable to the three different kinds of Eloquence. Theſe we may compare with each other in one Inſtance, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them all to uſe the ſame Heads, and in the ſame Order.</p>
                  <p>The Materials of the Speech are, The manifeſting his Grief for the War, with the hopes that it is in his Power to end it; an Acceptance of the propos'd Challenge; an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Ceremonies to be us'd in the League; and a Propoſal of a proper Caution to ſecure it.</p>
                  <p>Now had <hi>Neſtor</hi> theſe Materials to work upon, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have begun with a Relation of all the Troubles of the nine Year's Siege which he hop'd he might now bring to an end; he would court their Benevolence and good Wiſhes for his Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with all the Figures of Amplification; while he accepted the Challenge, he would have given an Example to prove that the ſingle Combate was a wiſe, gallant, and gentle way of ending the War, practis'd by their Fathers; in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rites he would be exceeding particular; and when he choſe to demand the Sanction of <hi>Priam</hi> rather than of his Sons, he would place in Oppoſition on one ſide the Son's Action which began the War, and on the other the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Concern or Repentance which it muſt by this time have made in the Father's Mind, whoſe Wiſdom he would undoubtedly extol as the effect of his Age. All this he would have expatiated upon with Connexions of the Diſcourſes in the moſt evident manner, and the moſt eaſy, gliding, undiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging Tranſitions. The Effect would be, that the People would hear him with Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Had it been <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> who was to make the Speech, he would have mention'd a few of their moſt affecting Calamities in a pathetick Air; then have undertaken the Fight with teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a chearful Joy, as ſhould have won the Hearts of the Soldiers to follow him to the Field without being deſired. He would have been exceeding cautious in wording the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and ſolemn rather than particular in ſpeaking of the Rites, which he would only inſiſt on as an Opportunity to exhort both ſides to a fear of the Gods, and a ſtrict regard
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0356100101:309"/>
of Juſtice. He would have remonſtrated the uſe of ſending for <hi>Priam;</hi> and (becauſe no Caution could be too much) have demanded his Sons to be bound with him. For a Concluſion he would have us'd ſome noble Sentiment agreeable to a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe, and (it may be) have enforc'd it with ſome inſpirited Action. In all this you would have known that the Diſcourſe hung together, but its Fire would not always ſuffer it to be ſeen in cooler Tranſitions, which (when they are too nicely laid open) may conduct the Reader, but never carry him away. The People would hear him with Emotion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Materials being given to <hi>Menelaus,</hi> he but juſt mentions their Troubles, and his Satisfaction in the Proſpect of ending them, ſhortens the Propoſals, ſays a Sacrifice is neceſſary, requires <hi>Priam</hi>'s Preſence to confirm the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, refuſes his Sons with a Reſentment of that Injury he ſuffer'd by them, and concludes with a Reaſon for his Choice from the Praiſe of Age, with a ſhort Gravity, and the Air of an Apothegm. This he puts in order without any more Tranſition than what a ſingle Conjunction affords. And the effect of the Diſcourſe is, that the People are inſtructed by it in what is to be done.</p>

Immediately on the ſight of this perfidious Action, the</hi> Greeks <hi>roſe in a Tumult; the</hi> Trojans <hi>riſing at the ſame time, came on, and reſcued</hi> Paris <hi>from his Enemy. Homer</hi> has with great Art and Invention mingled all this with the Marvellous, and rais'd it in the Air of Fable. The <hi>Goddeſs of Love</hi> reſcues her Favourite; <hi>Jupiter</hi> debates whether or no the War ſhall end by the Defeat of <hi>Paris; Juno</hi> is for the Continuance of it; <hi>Minerva</hi> incites <hi>Pandarus</hi> to break the Truce, who thereupon ſhoots at <hi>Menelaus.</hi> This heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Grandeur of the Action without deſtroying the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſimilitude, diverſifies the Poem, and exhibits a fine Moral; that whatever ſeems in the World the Effect of common Cauſes, is really owing to the Decree and Diſpoſition of the Gods.</p>

                     </gap> which is often apply'd to him, ſhould not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>warlike,</hi> but one who had <hi>an Affectation of loving War.</hi> In ſhort, that he was a weak Prince, play'd upon by others, ſhort in Speech, and of a bad Pronunciation, valiant only by fits, and ſometimes ſtumbling upon good Matter in his Speeches, as may happen to the moſt ſlender Capacity. This is one of the Myſteries which that Tranſlator boaſts to have found in <hi>Homer.</hi> But as it is no way conſiſtent with the Art of the Poet, to draw the Perſon in whoſe behalf he engages the World, in ſuch a manner as no Regard ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for him; we muſt endeavour to reſcue him from this Miſrepreſentation. Firſt then, the preſent Paſſage is taken by Antiquity in general to be apply'd not to his Pronunciation, but his Eloquence. So <hi>Auſonius</hi> in the foregoing Citation, and <hi>Cicero de claris Oratoribus: Menelaum ipſum dulcem illum quidem tradit Homerus, ſed pauca loquentem.</hi> And <hi>Quintilian l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>Homerus brevem cum animi jucunditate, &amp; propriam</hi> (<hi>id enim eſt</hi> non errare verbis) <hi>&amp; carentem ſupervacuis, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiam Menelao dedit,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, tho' his coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invited may have occaſion'd a jeſting Proverb, it may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be accounted for on the Principle of <hi>brotherly Love,</hi> which ſo viſibly characteriſes both him and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> throughout the Poem.

                     </gap> may import a Love of War, but not an ungrounded Affectation. Upon the whole, his Character is by no means contemptible, tho' not of the moſt ſhining Nature. He is called indeed in the 17<hi>th Iliad</hi>

But on the other hand, his Courage gives him a conſiderable Figure in conquering <hi>Paris,</hi> defending the Body of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> reſcuing <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> wounding <hi>Helenus,</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0356100101:318"/>
killing <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> &amp;c. He is full of Reſentment for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Injuries, which brings him to the War with a Spirit of Revenge in the ſecond Book, makes him blaſpheme <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the third, when <hi>Paris</hi> eſcapes him, and curſe the <hi>Grecians</hi> in the ſeventh when they heſitate to accept <hi>Hector</hi>'s Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.

Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> is alſo very ſevere upon <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> but for a Reaſon more natural to a Lady. She is of Opinion that the Paſſion of the Lover would ſcarce have been ſo exceſſive as he here deſcribes it, but for fear of loſing his Miſtreſs immediately, as foreſeeing the <hi>Greeks</hi> would demand her. One may anſwer to this lively Remark, that <hi>Paris</hi> having nothing to ſay for himſelf, was obliged to teſtify an uncommon Ardour for his Lady, at a time when Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were to paſs inſtead of Reaſons. I hope to be excus'd if (in Revenge for her Remark upon our Sex) I obſerve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Behaviour of <hi>Helen</hi> throughout this Book, which gives a pretty natural Picture of the Manners of theirs. We ſee her firſt in Tears, repentant, cover'd with Confuſion at the ſight of <hi>Priam,</hi> and ſecretly inclin'd to return to her former Spouſe. The Diſgrace of <hi>Paris</hi> increaſes her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of him; ſhe rails, ſhe reproaches, ſhe wiſhes his Death; and after all, is prevail'd upon by one kind Compliment, and yields to his Embraces. Methinks when this Lady's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and mine are laid together, the beſt that can be made of them is to conclude, that ſince both the Sexes have their Frailties, it would be well for each to forgive the other.</p>
                  <p>It is worth looking backward, to obſerve the <hi>Allegory</hi> here carry'd on with reſpect to <hi>Helena,</hi> who lives thro' this whole Book in a Whirl of Paſſions, and is agitated by turns with Sentiments of Honour and Love. The Goddeſſes made uſe of to caſt the Appearance of Fable over the Story, are <hi>Iris</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> When <hi>Helen</hi> is call'd to the Tower to behold her former Friends, <hi>Iris</hi> the Meſſenger of <hi>Juno</hi> (the Goddeſs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0356100101:325"/>
of Honour) is ſent for her; and when invited to the Bed-Chamber of <hi>Paris, Venus</hi> is to beckon her out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The Forms they take to carry on theſe different Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, are properly choſen: the one aſſuming the Perſon of the Daughter of <hi>Antenor,</hi> who preſs'd moſt for her being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to <hi>Menelaus;</hi> the other the Shape of an old Maid, who was privy to the Intrigue with <hi>Paris</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And in the Conſequences, as the one inſpires the Love of her former Empire, Friends and Country; ſo the other inſtills the Dread of being caſt off by all if ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook her ſecond Choice, and cauſes the Return of her Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to <hi>Paris.</hi> But if ſhe has a Struggle for <hi>Honour,</hi> ſhe is in a Bondage to <hi>Love;</hi> which gives the Story its Turn that way, and makes <hi>Venus</hi> oftner appear than <hi>Iris.</hi> There is in one Place a Lover to be protected, in another a Love-Quarrel to be made up, in both which the Goddeſs is kindly officious. She conveys <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Troy</hi> when he had eſcap'd the Enemy; which may hint his Love for his Miſtreſs, that hurry'd him away to juſtify himſelf before her. She ſoftens and terrifies <hi>Helen,</hi> in order to make up the Breach between them: And even when that Affair is finiſhed, we do not find the Poet diſmiſſes her from the Chamber, whatever Privacies the Lovers had a mind to: In which Circumſtance he ſeems to draw aſide the Veil of his Allegory, and to let the Reader at laſt into this Meaning of it, that the Goddeſs of Love has been all the while nothing more than the Paſſion of it.</p>

The fourth is the Senſe which is followed in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as ſeeming much the moſt natural, that every one ſhould be left to govern his own Chariot, and the other who is admitted fight only with the Javelin. The reaſon of this Advice appears by the Speech of <hi>Pandarus</hi> to <hi>Aeneas</hi> in the next Book: <hi>Aeneas</hi> having taken him up into his Chariot to go againſt <hi>Diomed,</hi> compliments him with the Choice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fight, or to manage the Reins, which was eſteem'd an Office of Honour.

                     <hi>Ariſtides</hi> had formerly blamed <hi>Homer</hi> for admitting <hi>Diſcord</hi> into Heaven, and <hi>Scaliger</hi> takes up the Criticiſm to throw him below <hi>Virgil. Fame</hi> (he ſays) is properly feign'd to hide her Head in the Clouds, becauſe the Grounds and Authors of Rumours are commonly unknown. As if the ſame might not be alledg'd for <hi>Homer,</hi> ſince the Grounds and Authors of <hi>Diſcord</hi> are often no leſs ſecret. <hi>Macrobius</hi> has put this among the Paſſages where he thinks <hi>Virgil</hi> has fallen ſhort in his Imitation of <hi>Homer,</hi> and brings theſe Reaſons for his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0356100101:378"/>
Opinion. <hi>Homer</hi> repreſents <hi>Diſcord</hi> to riſe from ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and afterwards in her Encreaſe to reach the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: <hi>Virgil</hi> has ſaid this of <hi>Fame,</hi> but not with equal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; for the Subjects are very different. <hi>Diſcord,</hi> tho' it reaches to War and Devaſtation, is ſtill <hi>Diſcord;</hi> nor ceaſes to be what it was at firſt. But <hi>Fame,</hi> when it grows to be univerſal, is <hi>Fame</hi> no longer, but becomes Knowledge and Certainty. For who calls any thing <hi>Fame,</hi> which is known from Earth to Heaven? Nor has <hi>Virgil</hi> equal'd the Strength of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Hyperbole, for one ſpeaks of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the other only of the <hi>Clouds. Macrob. Sat. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>Scaliger</hi> is very angry at this laſt Period, and by miſtake blames <hi>Gellius</hi> for it, in whom there is no ſuch thing. His Words are ſo inſolently dogmatical, that barely to quote them is to anſwer them, and the only Anſwer which ſuch a Spirit of Criticiſm deſerves. <hi>Clamant quòd Maro de Fama dixit eam inter nubila caput condere, cùm tamen Homerus unde ipſe accepit, in coelo caput Eridis conſtituit. Jam tibi pro me reſpondeo. Non ſum imitatus, nolo imitari: non placet, non eſt verum, Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem ponere caput in coelo.

                  <p>This fine Verſe was alſo criticiz'd by Monſ. <hi>Perault,</hi> who accuſes it as a forc'd and extravagant Hyperbole. M. <hi>Boileau</hi> anſwers, that Hyperboles as ſtrong are daily uſed even in common Diſcourſe, and that nothing is in effect more ſtrictly true than that <hi>Diſcord</hi> reigns over all the Earth, and in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven itſelf, that is to ſay, among the Gods of <hi>Homer.</hi> It is not (continues this excellent Critick) the Deſcription of a Giant, as this Cenſor would pretend, but a juſt Allegory; and as he makes <hi>Diſcord</hi> an allegorical Perſon, ſhe may be of what Size he pleaſes without ſhocking us; ſince it is what we regard only as an Idea and Creature of the Fancy, and not as a material Subſtance that has any Being in Nature. The Expreſſion in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> that the <hi>impious Man is lifted up as a Cedar of</hi> Libanus, does by no means imply that the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man was a Giant as tall as the Cedar. Thus far <hi>Boileau;</hi> and upon the whole we may obſerve, that it ſeems not only the Fate of great Genius's to have met with the moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Criticks, but of the fineſt and nobleſt Paſſages in them

He meant to compare the manner how <hi>Troy</hi> after many Battels, and after the Loſs of many Cities, conquer'd by the many Nations under <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in a long War, was thereby wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd and at laſt overthrown, with a great Tree hewn round about, and then falling by little and little leiſurely.
