            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO Her Royal Highneſs THE PRINCESS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT high Station, which by Your Birth You hold above the People, exacts from every one, as a Duty, whatever Honours they are capable of paying to Your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But that more exalted Place, to which Your Virtues have rais'd You, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb facs="tcp:0226400600:4"/>
the reſt of Princes, makes the Tribute of our Admiration and Praiſe, rather a Choice more immediately preventing that Duty.</p>
            <p>The Publick Gratitude is ever founded on a Publick Benefit; and what is univerſally Bleſs'd, is always an univerſal Bleſſing. Thus from Your ſelf we derive the Offerings which we bring; and that Incenſe which ariſes to Your Name, only returns to its Original, and but naturally requires the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of its Being.</p>
            <p>From hence it is that this Poem, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted on a Moral, whoſe End is to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and to encourage Virtue, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence has recourſe to Your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Patronage; aſpiring to caſt it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath Your Feet, and declining Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'till You ſhall condeſcend to own it, and vouchſafe to ſhine upon it as on a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Your Influence.</p>
            <p>'Tis from the Example of Princes that Virtue becomes a Faſhion in the People, for even they who are averſe to Inſtruction, will yet be fond of Imitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0226400600:5"/>
But there are Multitudes, who never can have Means nor Opportunities of ſo near an Acceſs, as to partake of the Benefit of ſuch Examples. And to theſe, Tragedy, which diſtinguiſhes it ſelf from the Vulgar Poetry by the Dignity of its Characters, may be of Uſe and Information. For they who are at that diſtance from Original Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to be depriv'd of the Happineſs of Contemplating the Perfections and real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Your Royal Highneſ's Perſon in Your Court, may yet behold ſome ſmall Sketches and Imagings of the Virtues of Your Mind, abſtracted, and repreſented in the Theatre.</p>
            <p>Thus Poets are inſtructed, and inſtruct; not alone by Precepts which perſuade, but alſo by Examples which illuſtrate. Thus is Delight interwoven with Inſtruction; when not only Virtue is preſcrib'd, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>
            <p>But if we are delighted with the Livelineſs of a feign'd Repreſentation of Great and Good Perſons and their Actions, how muſt
<pb facs="tcp:0226400600:6"/>
we be charm'd with beholding the Perſons themſelves? If one or two excelling Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, barely touch'd in the ſingle Action and ſmall Compaſs of a Play, can warm an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, with a Concern and Regard even for the ſeeming Succeſs and Proſperity of the Actor; with what Zeal muſt the Hearts of all be fill'd, for the continued and encreaſing Happineſs of thoſe, who are the true and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtances of Elevated and Perſiſting Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Even the Vicious themſelves muſt have a ſecret Veneration for thoſe peculiar Graces and Endowments, which are daily ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently conſpicuous in Your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and though repining, feel a Pleaſure which in ſpite of Envy they per-force ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
            <p>If in this Piece, humbly offer'd to Your Royal Highneſs, there ſhall appear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of any one of thoſe many Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which You ſo promiſcuouſly poſſeſs, to be drawn ſo as to merit Your leaſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, it has the End and Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its Deſign. And however imperfect
<pb facs="tcp:0226400600:7"/>
it may be in the Whole, through the Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience or Incapacity of the Author, yet, if there is ſo much as to convince Your Royal Highneſs, that a Play may be with Induſtry ſo diſpos'd (in ſpight of the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practice of the Modern Theatre) as to become ſometimes an innocent, and not unprofitable Entertainment; it will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly gratifie the Ambition, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the Endeavours of,</p>

            <lg>
               <l>THE Time has been when Plays were not ſo plenty,</l>
               <l>And a leſs Number New would well content ye.</l>
               <l>New Plays did then like Almanacks appear;</l>
               <l>And One was thought ſufficient for a Year:</l>
               <l>Tho' they are more like Almanacks of late;</l>
               <l>For in one Year, I think, they're out of Date.</l>
               <l>Nor were they without Reaſon join'd together;</l>
               <l>For juſt as one prognoſticates the Weather,</l>
               <l>How plentiful the Crop, or ſcarce the Grain,</l>
               <l>What Peals of Thunder, and what Show'rs of Rain;</l>
               <l>So t'other can foretel, by certain Rules,</l>
               <l>What Crops of Coxcombs, or what Floods of Fools.</l>
               <l>In ſuch like Prophecies were Poets skill'd,</l>
               <l>Which now they find in their own Tribe fulfill'd:</l>
               <l>The Dearth of Wit they did ſo long preſage,</l>
               <l>Is fall'n on us, and almoſt ſtarves the Stage.</l>
               <l>Were you not griev'd, as often as you ſaw</l>
               <l>Poor Actors threſh ſuch empty Sheafs of Straw?</l>
               <l>Toiling and lab'ring, at their Lungs Expence,</l>
               <l>To ſtart a Jeſt, or force a little Senſe.</l>

Hard Fate for us! ſtill harder in th' Event;</l>
               <l>Our Authors Sin, but we alone Repent.</l>
               <l>Still they proceed, and, at our Charge, write worſe;</l>
               <l>'Twere ſome Amends if they could reimburſe:</l>
               <l>But there's the Devil, tho' their Cauſe is loſt,</l>
               <l>There's no recovering Damages or Coſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Good Wits, forgive this Liberty we take,</l>
               <l>Since Cuſtom gives the Loſers leave to ſpeak.</l>
               <l>But if provok'd, your dreadful Wrath remains,</l>
               <l>Take your Revenge upon the coming Scenes:</l>
               <l>For that damn'd Poet's ſpar'd who Damns a Brother,</l>
               <l>As one Thief 'ſcapes that Executes another.</l>
               <l>Thus far alone does to the Wits relate;</l>
               <l>But from the reſt we hope a better Fate.</l>
               <l>To pleaſe and move has been our Poet's Theme,</l>
               <l>Art may direct, but Nature is his Aim;</l>
               <l>And Nature miſs'd, in vain he boaſts his Art,</l>
               <l>For only Nature can affect the Heart.</l>
               <l>Then freely judge the Scenes that ſhall enſue,</l>
               <l>But as with Freedom, judge with Candour too.</l>
