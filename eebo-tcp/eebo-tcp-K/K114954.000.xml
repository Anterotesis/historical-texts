            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is very natural and commendable for every man to be ever inquiring after any diſcovery or improvement that may be uſeful to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and to communicate it to the publick, I am willing to hope that the care and pains, the time and expence I have beſtow'd on the following Hiſtory, will be approv'd by every one who conſiders the nature, uſe and extent of it; and the rather, becauſe nothing has been yet publiſh'd, at leaſt in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on the ſubject of <hi>PRINTING,</hi> ſo methodical and comprehenſive either in the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> or <hi>Practical</hi> part of it. As to the Hiſtory, I could not, without ſome regret, obſerve that we had nothing in our own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but ſome few fragments diſpers'd in ſeveral Authors, who only ſpoke of it occaſionally, whilſt ſo many <hi>Italians, Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> had wrote ſo copiouſly upon it, and <hi>ex profeſſo.</hi> Tho' even theſe ſeem rather to have had a view to the introduction and progreſs of the Art in their reſpective countries, than to the diſplaying of its excellency and improvements. Neither did I find that any of them had given ſo particular a Hiſtory of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inventors, or ſo general a one of its progreſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation through <hi>Europe,</hi> and beyond it, as I could have wiſh'd, or as I thought might be compiled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0712300300:3"/>
However, neither theſe conſiderations, nor the diſcoveries I had made from ſome ancient and valuable editions I met with in ſome of our noble libraries, nor even the examples of ſeveral men of my profeſſion abroad, who have writ largely on both the ſubjects, could have prevail'd upon me to have undertaken this <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> part, which I knew deſerved a much better pen. The <hi>Practical</hi> being more within my province, my ambition reached no higher than to have publiſhed ſuch a compleat ſyſtem of it, from the helps I had received from Mr. <hi>Fertel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jn. Andr. Endters,</hi> (two eminent Printers, the firſt at St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s, and the other at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> who have publiſhed two curious treatiſes of it) and from my own obſervations and improvements on them; as few of my profeſſion would have fail'd of being the better for in ſome branch or other of the Art. And I could with the utmoſt pleaſure have communicated all the other diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries which I had occaſionally made, to any perſon that would have been at the pains of writing this Hiſtory. But when I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd my deſign, I found, to my ſurpriſe, that the Practical part would not meet with that encouragement and approbation I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, particularly from thoſe for whoſe benefit and improvement I had chiefly deſign'd it, tho' the publick could not but have been the better for it, by having much better and neater impreſſions than are generally done.</p>
            <p>Upon this account my friends and patrous perſuaded me to alter my Deſign, and to ſuſpend the Practical part, till the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical, which they preſs'd me alſo to undertake, had in ſome meaſure made way for it. Purſuant therefore to this new plan, I reſolved to ſpare neither coſt nor pains to get a ſight, or at leaſt a certain intelligence of all the Old editions that were valuable either for their antiquity, elegancy, or for any light they could give me into this Hiſtory, and to add my own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0712300300:4"/>
obſervations upon them, not only as an hiſtorian, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as a <hi>PRINTER.</hi> The Reader will find, by the ſequel, that none but one of that profeſſion, and one that is well vers'd in thoſe old ancient works can form a right judgment of them; and this is the reaſon that ſo many of them have been miſtaken for Manuſcripts, or have been ſuppoſed to have been printed upon wooden blocks, even by perſons otherwiſe very learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, whereas it is even demonſtrable that they were done by ſeparate metal types.</p>
            <p>My next care was to read over all that has been writ hitherto upon the ſubject, eſpecially by the judicious <hi>Malinkrot,</hi> by <hi>De la Caille, Chevilier, Endters, P. Pater, Orlandi,</hi> and by the learned Mr. <hi>Maittaire,</hi> from all whom the Reader will find I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no ſmall helps, and which I do here gladly acknowledge; and if I have at any time ventured to diſſent from them, I hope he will find my opinion back'd with ſufficient authority; but where that could not be obtained, I have contented myſelf with leading the Reader to the moſt probable ſide. And it is with no ſmall pleaſure that I have found one or two of my conjectures ſince confirm'd by the diſcovery of ſome latent pieces, which were not known to them. They had indeed acceſs to the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Libraries of their own countries, but this Hiſtory will convince them that all that is valuable and curious is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to them, and that we have many as nobly and richly furniſh'd in our own as any in theirs.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhould be extremely ungrateful, if I did not take this opportunity of acknowledging the great helps and curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations I have been favour'd with by ſeveral of the Patrons and Encouragers of this work, as well as my great obligations to the Right Honourable the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> to whom I am proud to own myſelf beholden (but more eſpecially
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0712300300:5"/>
to the former,) for all the diſcoveries which this Hiſtory has above any other extant. My free acceſs to thoſe two Libraries, as well as to thoſe of my very good friends Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> Dr. <hi>Rawlinſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and others, beſides ſome of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ones, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Oxford, Cambridge,</hi> and of the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> have afforded me the ſatisfaction of ſeeing many of thoſe ſcarce editions, which have been mention'd by moſt Annaliſts, if we except Mr. <hi>Maittaire,</hi> either from Catalogues or hear-ſay. And here I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to theſe learned Correſpondents, who have favour'd me with any ourious intelligence from thoſe Libraries, which my Buſineſs and the bad ſtate of health, would not permit me to viſit.</p>
            <p>The order of this Hiſtory is as follows.</p>
            <p>The firſt book contains an account of the Diſcovery and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of the Art, whether really ſuch, or only pretended, with remarks on their firſt tryals upon Blocks, and their firſt editions.</p>
            <p>The ſecond book treats of the promulgation of <hi>PRINTING</hi> into all the ſeveral cities and places in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements made to it by the moſt eminent Printers down to <hi>An. 1520.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third gives an account of its firſt introduction into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> its riſe and progreſs in ſeveral cities, towns and mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; with the characters and works of the moſt famous <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Printers to <hi>an. 1550,</hi> a fuller account of all which may be ſeen in the following <hi>Table of CONTENTS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Performance I entirely ſubmit to the approbation or cenſure of the curious and candid, as it ſhall deſerve. And I ſhall gain the main end I propos'd, if what I have done ſhall contribute to ſome more full and elaborate productions of this nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0712300300:6"/>
               <hi>Thus far Mr. PALMER's</hi> Preface <hi>to the Hiſtorical part, as to what relates to the Practical, we need not trouble the Reader with it here. What the Author deſign'd to treat of in it, may be ſeen by the</hi> Table of Contents <hi>prefix'd to the firſt Number of this work. In this Table he will likewiſe find ſeveral particulars which were promis'd to be added to this Hiſtory, but which we have been obliged to omit, either for want of materials, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not thought ſo neceſſary to this work by the promoters of it. Of the firſt ſort was the</hi> Hiſtory of Printing <hi>in</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>concerning the former of which we can add nothing to the ſhort account which was printed at</hi> Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh <hi>by Mr.</hi> Watſon <hi>the King's Printer there; and as for</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>we are ſtill more in the dark for want of Memoirs. Mr. PALMER had likewiſe promis'd the Prints of the</hi> Rebus's <hi>of all the foreign eminent PRINTERS, but, as he had not got them cut before his death, and has given an account of them at the end of their works, it was thought that charge might as well be ſpared; ſo that we have only added thoſe which were uſed by the moſt conſiderable ones of our own nation. His liſt of the moſt excellent PRINTERS from 1500 to this time; the ſeveral acts for regulating the Preſs, and for ſecuring the property of Copies, being left very imperfect, the charge of finiſhing them was likewiſe thought unneceſſary; for which reaſon they are alſo omitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that needs be added with regard to his Practical part, is, that, as it was intended to have been printed firſt, the Author has left it in ſuch perfect order, that, if the Publick will be pleaſed to encourage it, an Edition may be eaſily printed from his Manuſcript. 'Twere needleſs to tell the world how fit he was for ſuch a work, what pains he has taken, and what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he made to it; thoſe who knew Mr. PALMER will think it ſufficient to ſay that the ſubject is the</hi> Art of Printing, <hi>and he the Author of it.</hi>

I ſhall begin with a previous enquiry into the cauſes and concurrent circumſtances, which excited the inventors of it to a diſcovery, that might anſwer this end, with more expedition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, than <hi>Tranſcribing,</hi> the only method known before.</p>

THE world at this time began to recover from a ſtate of ignorance, under which it had labour'd many centuries; learning reviv'd, and was patroniz'd in almoſt every country of <hi>Europe;</hi> its votaries exerted a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable zeal in ſearching the libraries for thoſe valuable books, which had lain buried in obſcurity, and were become extremely ſcarce, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being loſt in the times of ignorance. Manuſcripts were procur'd and multiplied; but the price of them was ſuch, that none but men of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune could purchaſe them: 120 crowns for a <hi>Livy,</hi> and 80 crowns for three volumes of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Lives <note n="*" place="bottom">De tribus voluminibus PLUTARCHI in quibus parallela viginti quatuor continentur, titulos ſumpſit, ut mones; pretium minus LXXX aureis eſſe non poteſt, &amp;c. <hi>Papiens.</hi> p 114. vet. edit.</note>, was then a moderate price: a few manuſcripts were thought a portion worthy a nobleman's daughter; and one or two intitled the donor and his poſterity to the perpetual prayers of a monaſtery: nay kings themſelves diſdain'd not the office of procuring them for their learned friends, as appears from a letter of <hi>Antoninus Boca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Panormus,</hi> to <hi>Alphonſus</hi> king of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi>

                  <p>As this exceſſive price tempted ſome to purchaſe eſtates by the ſale of their books, and exchange learning for money; ſo the learned at that time freely parted with their wealth to procure thoſe invaluable remains of antiquity, out of a generous deſign to communicate them to the world.</p>
                  <p>THE Tranſcribers now had a favourable opportunity of enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they might have enjoy'd much longer, had not they (poſſeſs'd with the moſt mercenary views) done an incredible, and in ſome caſes ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0712300300:14"/>
damage to learning, by mutilating and corrupting the beſt authors: hence ariſe thoſe frequent complaints againſt their negligence and ignorance, which have coſt the learned an infinite deal of labour to remedy: to evince this the following inſtance will ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>JOHN ANDREAS, biſhop of <hi>Aleria,</hi> one of the greateſt criticks of that age, tells Pope <hi>Paul</hi> II. in his dedication prefix'd to <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">In nonum annum premi non potuit emendatio, ne futura quidem exacta poſt nonageſimum.</note>, printed at <hi>Rome</hi> in the houſe of the <hi>Maximis</hi> by <hi>Panaratz</hi> and <hi>Sweyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim, anno</hi> 1470, that tho' he had ſpent nine whole years in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting that author; yet ninety more would not compleat a correct edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This demonſtrates what difficulties the republick of learning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd with at it's revival; namely, the ſcarcity and exceſſive price of books, and the ſordidneſs of the Tranſcribers, from whoſe hands they came ſo maim'd and incorrect, that the great Printer <hi>Stephens</hi> truly ſaid, <hi>they were a plague to the purchaſer.</hi> Theſe were motives ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Inventors of this Art to a diſcovery ſo beneficial to the world, and of ſuch honour and advantage to themſelves: who thoſe excellent perſons were, and where it was made, will come under our enquiry in its proper place. And here the reader will find juſt cauſe of wonder, that this Art, which has been ſtiled the nurſe and preſerver of arts and ſciences, ſhould (if I may uſe the expreſſion) be ſo forgetful of itſelf, as not to leave us the leaſt ſketch of its own hiſtory, the inventors being <hi>more ambitious of deſerving, than of purchaſing praiſe.</hi> Some light indeed we receive in this affair from a few inſcriptions uſed by <hi>Fauſt</hi> at the end of his firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted books, to this purpoſe. <hi>This preſent work, with all its embelliſhments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was done, not with pen and ink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by a new invented Art of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters, Printing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by me</hi> John Fauſt <hi>and my ſon-in-law</hi> Peter Schoeffer <hi>in the famous city of</hi> Mentz <hi>upon the</hi> Rhine, <hi>anno—</hi>: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be had to the writers of thoſe times for the hiſtory of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Many cities have contended for the glory of it, and engaged the learned in defence of their claim; but thoſe on the ſide of <hi>Harlem</hi> have manag'd the controverſy with great warmth, and charged <hi>Fauſt</hi> the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with robbing his ſuppoſed maſter <hi>Laurence John Coſter</hi> of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand weight of his materials, on Chriſtmas-Eve, when the whole family and city were in prayer at church; with other ſuch ridiculous ſtories, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented meerly to deprive this <hi>Great Man</hi> of the honour, which he had ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0712300300:15"/>
long inconteſtably enjoy'd. Had this been publiſh'd in his life-time, when he might have defended himſelf, or preſently after his death, when his ſon-in-law or ſome of his friends might have done it for him, he had undoubtedly been clear'd; but ſuch an accuſation was not hinted till 125 years after, and then grounded only on ſuſpicion, as Dr. <hi>Junius</hi> owns <note n="*" place="bottom">Ut fert ſuſpicio.</note>, who was the firſt that attempted to transfer this Diſcovery from <hi>Mentz</hi> to <hi>Harlem.</hi> However <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s name died not with him, tho' ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters made uſe of <hi>his art</hi> to aſperſe his memory: and others of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nations roſe immediately in his defence; in particular the learned <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lincrot,</hi> dean of <hi>Munſter,</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>De Ortu &amp; Progreſſu Artis Typogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicae,</hi> has not only refuted what was advanc'd on the other ſide, but made ſuch reſearches after the old monuments of the Art, and collected ſo great a variety of teſtimonies, ſupported by undeniable facts, as ſeem at once to determine the controverſy. <hi>Boxhorn</hi> indeed attempted an anſwer; but whoever reads it over, cannot but be convinc'd, that an over-fondneſs for his country's honour has made him deaf to the moſt evident demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his antagoniſt. However as he and his followers, have given up the point as to ſeparate Metal Types in favour of <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> and lay claim only to the invention of <hi>Printing on Blocks of Wood,</hi> which they affirm to have been ſtoln from <hi>Coſter</hi> by <hi>Fauſt,</hi> whoſe next invention they would have to be only an improvement of the former; I ſhall give the reader an idea of both, and ſhew the difference between thoſe firſt eſſays of Printing, and that perfect one, which ſucceeded and continues to this day.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. An Account of the different Manners of Printing by <hi>Blocks of Wood,</hi> and ſeparate Metal Types.</head>
                  <p>TIS agreed by moſt writers on this ſubject, that about the year 1440, ſeveral attempts were made by ſome perſons, with vaſt expence and labour, which prov'd abortive; but that the diſcovery of ſeparate Metal Types was not brought to perfection till about the year 1450. We find that their firſt eſſays were by carving or cutting letters with a ſharp-pointed knife upon Blocks of Wood, each Block containing a page or one ſide of a leaf; that inſtead of the common

Ink, which is the ſort they firſt us'd, they invented a more glutinous one which ſucceeded better, being leſs apt to ſpread; that they paſted the two white ſides of each leaf together, to make them look like ſingle leaves: but of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more particularly in ſome of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing chapters. In the mean time I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate that this invention has not that merit for ingenuity, uſefulneſs, or novelty, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> writers boaſt of.</p>
                  <p>WITH reſpect to the firſt, the only requiſites are a tolerable genius, ſharp tools, and a good copy: as to its uſefulneſs, the only advantage reſulting from it, is, that whatever the book be, the forms remain intire, ſo that as many editions as the author pleaſes may be printed without the expence of a new compoſition; but on the other hand, if we conſider that thoſe forms are of no uſe to any other work, and the time and expence in cutting them very great, with the great ſpace ſo many Pages of Wood muſt take up, we ſhall perceive the neceſſity of inventing moveable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Types: But farther, this method of Printing was far from being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, it is even demonſtrable from authentick teſtimonies to have been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> above four centuries before it was known in <hi>Europe:</hi> it is not eaſy, I grant, to prove that we receiv'd it from them, becauſe of their vaſt diſtance, and the little commerce between us before the year 1440: yet there is no impoſſibility, but that it might have been brought us by ſome merchant either by the way of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> or the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> the <hi>Perſian Gulph</hi> or <hi>Arabia:</hi> of which opinion I could mention many authors. <hi>Gonzala de Mendoſa,</hi> in his hiſtory of the <hi>Marvels of China,</hi> written in Spaniſh, Book III. Chap. 16; and <hi>Martin Martini</hi> in his <hi>Atlas Sinenſis,</hi> tell us, that they could prove by good arguments, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Guns,</hi> of the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> was known to us by their means. What adds to the probability of my conjecture is, that the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> to this day ſend with their goods, printed papers in the manner of our ſhop-keepers hand-bills, ſeveral of which I have ſeen; and 'tis not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but the hint of Printing on Blocks of Wood might have been taken this way.</p>
                  <p>WHOEVER has a juſt idea of the genius of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> and <hi>Japoneſe,</hi> will own their capacity to have invented the method of Printing with ſeparate types, if their manner of writing had admitted it; but as they are known to write, not with letters, as other nations, but with characters, each of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0712300300:17"/>
which ſtands for a whole word; and that the number of thoſe characters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount at leaſt to 10,000, (tho' ſome authors reckon above 40,000); it would be impoſſible to have caſes large enough to contain 'em, beſides the inſuperable difficulty of diſtinguiſhing and retaining them in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To return from this digreſſion, let us now take a ſhort view of the other new and more expeditious method.</p>
                  <p>IF we duely conſider it in all its branches, it will evidently appear the reſult of no ſmall ſtudy, time and coſt. The cutting the counter-punches and punches and ſinking them into the matrices, the adjuſting them to the mould, that curious piece of mechaniſm, for caſting ſingle letters; the difficulty of the whole manual operation of Letter-founding: in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the diſpoſition of the caſes, the curious contrivance of the ſeveral parts of the work between the compoſitors, correctors and preſs-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> add to all this the fine invention of the Printing-preſs, ſo admirable for its mechanical fabrick, together with the curious apparatus neceſſary for a Printing-houſe, for an explication of whoſe terms we muſt refer to the ſecond volume of this work: theſe are things which require a genius vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuperior to deviſe, better hands to execute, greater forecaſt to obviate, and readineſs to remedy all unexpected defects, more time and patience to go thro' all its various parts, more reſolution to overcome all difficulties, and laſtly the expences neceſſary to this invention vaſtly larger than thoſe of the former; and conſequently we ſhall be far from thinking an interval of ten years too long, but rather admire that ſuch a prodigious deſign could be contriv'd and perfected in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p>WHAT has been ſaid on this head, will ſufficiently demonſtrate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity between theſe two methods, and convince the reader how much the former is inferior in every reſpect to the latter; nay, if we dare rely on the judgment of the learned, we ſhould ſcarce think it worthy the name of Printing, ſince it has nothing common with it except the ink; and even a rowler, cover'd with cloath, would ſupply the place of a preſs to print their Pages of Wood.</p>
                  <p>NOW whether it be <hi>Fauſt</hi> or <hi>Coſter,</hi> who practis'd this method on wood firſt, whether <hi>Mentz, Harlem,</hi> or any other city, gave it firſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whether the afore-nam'd perſons had the hint from <hi>China,</hi> or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd on it accidentally, (tho' if we admit of the latter ſuppoſition, <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Mentz</hi> have the better title); this muſt be granted from what has
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0712300300:18"/>
been ſaid, that by Printing we do not underſtand the method of Printing on Blocks of Wood claim'd by <hi>Harlem,</hi> but the preſent Art of Printing by ſeparate Metal Types, which is ſo juſtly admir'd for its expeditious and correct way of preſerving and propagating knowledge; and to which we owe the improvements made in moſt arts and ſciences for near three cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies paſt.</p>
                  <p>HENCE it appears how little reaſon the <hi>Dutch</hi> writers have to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon an imaginary victory, which, were it granted in its fulleſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, would be deſpicable in compariſon of the other. Yet <hi>Boxhorn</hi> in his <hi>Theatrum Hollandiae,</hi> page 142. places his hero <hi>Coſter</hi> in a kind of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal chariot, dragging his vanquiſh'd enemies the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> after him, with a pompous inſcription, which I think worthy the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious readers notice <note n="*" place="bottom">

But I would therefore avoid, as much as poſſible, clogging or interrupting the thread of this hiſtory. I ſhall only extract the moſt material authorities out of them, and in ſuch a manner as ſhall be conſiſtent with it, by inſerting the paſſages themſelves in the notes, that the reader may uſe his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure either in reading or omitting them.</p>

BUT before I proceed any farther, it will be neceſſary to obviate an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that will infallibly occur to the reader's mind; which is, that in mentioning the firſt inventors of printing in the two preceding chapters, I have not ſo much as nam'd <hi>John Guttenbergh:</hi> whereas the greateſt part of the authors, whom we are about to quote, place him in the firſt rank, and mention only the other two as co-adjutors to him. In anſwer to this it will be ſufficient for the preſent to ſay, that the ſequel of this Hiſtory will ſhew that <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> had no other ſhare in this invention, than by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the other two with neceſſary ſupplies to defray the great charges of it; and that the authors of the <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Cologn</hi> Chronicle, whom the reſt ſeem to have follow'd in this, as alſo the learned antiquary <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius,</hi> have certainly confounded <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> with <hi>Fauſt,</hi> that is, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook the one for the other, as will hereafter appear in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>OF all the authors, to whom the world is indebted for a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Diſcovery, Abbot <hi>Trithemius</hi> juſtly claims the pre-eminence, both upon the account of his living neareſt the time of this diſcovery, which he tells us happen'd in his younger years <note n="1" place="bottom">Tempore infantiae meae apud <hi>Moguntiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Trith.

1450.) in the city of <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and not in <hi>Italy,</hi> as ſome writers falſly affirm'd, the wonderful and <hi>till then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Art</hi> of Printing Books by Metal Types <hi>[characterizandi]</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and devis'd by <hi>John Guttenberg,</hi> citizen of <hi>Mentz;</hi> who having almoſt exhauſted his whole eſtate in contriving of this new Method, and labouring under ſuch inſuperable difficulties, in one reſpect or other, that he began to deſpair of, and to throw up the whole deſign; was at length aſſiſted with the advice and purſe of <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> another ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and happily brought it to perfection. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begun with cutting characters of the letters upon wooden planks, in their right order, and compleated their forms, they printed the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulary intitled <hi>Catholicon;</hi> but could make no farther uſe of thoſe forms, becauſe there was no poſſibility of ſeparating the letters, which were engraven on the planks, as we hinted before. To this ſucceeded a more ingenious invention; for they found out a way of ſtamping the ſhapes of every letter of the <hi>Latin</hi> Alphabet, in what they call Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from which they afterwards caſt their letters, either in copper or tin, hard enough to be printed upon, which they firſt cut with their own hands. It is certain this art met with no ſmall difficulties from the beginning of its invention, as I heard 30 years ago from the mouth of <hi>Peter Schoeffer de Gernſheim,</hi> citizen of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Son-in-law to the firſt Inventor of the Art.</hi> For when they went about printing the Bible, before they had work'd off the third quire, it had coſt them already above 4000 florins. But the afore-mention'd <hi>Peter Schoeffer,</hi> then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and afterwards <hi>Son-in-law to the firſt Inventor</hi> John Fauſt, as we hinted before, being a perſon of great ingenuity, diſcover'd an eaſier method of caſting letters, and perfected the art as we now have it. Theſe three kept this manner of printing very ſecret for ſome time,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0712300300:23"/>
until it was divulg'd by their ſervants, without whoſe help it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to manage the buſineſs, who carry'd it firſt to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and by degrees all over <hi>Europe.—</hi>Thus much will ſuffice concerning the diſcovery of this wonderful art, the firſt inventors of which were citizens of <hi>Mentz.—</hi>Theſe three firſt diſcoverers of printing, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>FROM this authentick teſtimony, I ſhall beg leave to make the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſervations, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That when the author concluded his Chronicle, <hi>ann.</hi> 1514. two years before his death, and above 64 years after the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, this invention was indiſputably aſcrib'd to <hi>Mentz;</hi> he ſays indeed that ſome writers had attributed it to <hi>Italy,</hi> but without any foundation; and therefore he rejects this notion as abſolutely falſe. Yet <hi>Junius,</hi> as has been already hinted, firſt ſtarted a diſpute in favour of <hi>Harlem,</hi> almoſt 130 years after the art became known; and after him Dr. <hi>Mentel</hi> began another in favour of <hi>Strasburgh, ann.</hi> 1650, both which ſhall be anſwer'd in their places.</p>
                  <p>THE next obſervation is, that tho' the paſſage quoted out of his firſt Chronicle ſeems to be taken, if not copy'd out of that of <hi>Mentz,</hi> which is likewiſe a very antient and authentick monument, yet our author ſeems not to have been ſatisfy'd with it, till he had it confirm'd by ſurer hands. Other authors indeed have written concerning the origin of this art, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt memoirs they could procure, whether true or falſe; but our author alone has been at the pains to fetch his information from the fountain head, and deliver'd the particulars of it, as he receiv'd 'em from the principal agent in the invention, in the quotation from his ſecond Chronicle: ſo that his teſtimony, were it the only one we could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for <hi>Mentz,</hi> ought ſtill to be eſteem'd unqueſtionable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive.</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER particular worth our obſervation is, that tho' he mentions two books as printed immediately upon the diſcovery, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Catholicon</hi> and the <hi>Bible,</hi> yet he ſufficiently ſhews the difference between the methods of their impreſſion; the former being done upon wooden planks, cut with a knife after the <hi>Chineſe</hi> manner, as our wooden cutts are done now; whereas the <hi>Bible</hi> was printed with ſeparate types, which, as we ſhew'd in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0712300300:24"/>
the preceding chapter, is the only way that merits the name of <hi>Printing.</hi> This ſeems plainly intimated by the words in the citation before-mentioned, <hi>When they came to print the Bible; and by the vaſt expence they had been at before they finiſh'd the third quire of it:</hi> from which it is evident, that this ſacred book was the firſt work of conſequence which the authors of this art made choice of to ſignalize the firſt-fruits of their invention.</p>
                  <p>THE laſt thing I would obſerve is, that tho' <hi>Trithemius</hi> gives the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this diſcovery to <hi>John Guttenbergh,</hi> in the beginning of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, yet within a few lines after, he twice gives the title of <hi>The firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Printing</hi> to <hi>John Fauſt;</hi> which contradiction cannot be well recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd otherwiſe, than by ſuppoſing that he, thro' inadvertency, wrote the name of <hi>John Guttenberg</hi> inſtead of <hi>John Fauſt</hi> and this is far from being improbable, ſince their chriſtian names are the ſame: and tho' he again puts <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> firſt, when he ſpeaks of the houſe in which they liv'd, yet this might be done only out of reſpect to him, either as being a knight (according to the writers of that time), or becauſe he was the moſt opulent of the three, and had contributed moſt to the charges of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
                  <p>THIS muſt be allow'd, unleſs we could ſuppoſe that the editor having compar'd the two paſſages together, namely, that out of the firſt, and this out of the ſecond Chronicle, had corrected, as he imagin'd, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the former, upon a ſuſpicion, that the author writing the laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 30 years after he had receiv'd the account from <hi>Schoeffer,</hi> might have miſtaken one name for the other; but to be certain of this, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſult the original. However, what confirms me in my conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is, that the author or his editor have committed a miſtake, and that <hi>Guttenberg</hi> had no other intereſt in the diſcovery than by aſſiſting them with money to promote the deſign, is, the law-ſuit which he commenc'd againſt <hi>Fauſt</hi> at <hi>Mentz</hi> about the money expended, and the judgment of the court thereupon; of which the learned <hi>Salmuth</hi> has given the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account in his appendix to <hi>Pancirol</hi>'s commentaries <note n="1" place="bottom">Eodem tempore <hi>Moguntiae</hi> commore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur <hi>Johannes Guttenbergius,</hi> honeſtis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentibus natus, qui proxime <hi>Fauſti</hi> aedibus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitabat.

                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"ABOUT this time there liv'd at <hi>Mentz</hi> one <hi>John Guttenbergh,</hi> born of honeſt parents, who dwelt next door to <hi>John Fauſt:</hi> he obſerving this famous art of Printing was not only cry'd up every where, but alſo very gainful, contracted a friendſhip with <hi>Fauſt;</hi> and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich, offer'd to ſupply him with money to defray the charges of it, which was gladly accepted by <hi>Fauſt,</hi> who began to find the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence grow too faſt upon him, and wanted <hi>vellum</hi> to print a work then in hand. Upon this he agrees and covenants with <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> that whatever ſums were laid out in the work, ſhould turn to their common profit or loſs. But becauſe <hi>Fauſt</hi> had diſpos'd of more money then <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> imagin'd the buſineſs would require, he refuſed to pay his moiety; upon which a diſſenſion aroſe between them, and they ſummon'd each other before the judges at <hi>Mentz.</hi> The parties being heard, it was decreed, that if <hi>Fauſt</hi> would make oath, that all the money which he had borrow'd, had been expended in carrying on the common buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that he had converted no part thereof to his own private uſes; <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> ſhould be oblig'd to pay him. <hi>Fauſt</hi> ſubmitted to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; as may evidently be prov'd from an original inſtrument ſtill extant, which was drawn <hi>Nov.</hi> 6. <hi>ann.</hi> 1455. by <hi>Uldric Helmoſperger,</hi>

Hence it manifeſtly follows that <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> was in no wiſe the inventor or firſt author of Printing; but that he had been admitted by <hi>Fauſt</hi> into partnerſhip with him ſome few years after the diſcovery of the art, and had lent him money to proſecute the deſign.<hi>—Guttenbergh</hi> being caſt, and oblig'd to pay coſt and charges, and new quarrels ariſing daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Fauſt</hi> and him, and he having ſeen and learn'd the buſineſs, as it was impoſſible that among ſo many hands requiſite to the carrying on of the art, it ſhould continue longer a ſecret, which probably God would not ſuffer it to be, he <hi>[Guttenbergh]</hi> went off to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> taking ſome of the workmen along with him.

I have convers'd with, whoſe curioſity hath lead them to ſearch into the riſe and progreſs of Printing, and all the writers upon this ſubject I could ever meet with, not one has pretended to have ſeen any book printed in <hi>John Guttenbergh</hi>'s name, even in the oldeſt monuments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the infancy of this art, whether printed upon wood, or by ſeparate metal types: 2.

him at leaſt the glory of having practis'd the art at <hi>Mentz</hi> before <hi>Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh</hi> came, and to have directed him in perfecting what he had in vain attempted at <hi>Strasburg.</hi> The reader may likewiſe obſerve that <hi>Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh</hi> ſeems to have been thus denominated from the houſe ſo call'd, in which <hi>Fauſt</hi> and he carried on the buſineſs, till their mutual diſcords parted them.</p>
                  <p>JOHN NAUCLERUS author of the univerſal hiſtory, which is divided into generations, <note n="1" place="bottom">Hiſtor. Univer.

The remainder of this paſſage chiefly relates to the diſperſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the art; and therefore is unneceſſary to be ſet down here. There is but one thing in this quotation that can puzzle the reader; which is, that the author makes <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> to have been one of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſervants, inſtead of his partner and uſurer as has been ſhewed already; in the reſt he exactly agrees with the writers quoted before. With reſpect to the diſagreement among authors concerning the names of the firſt inventors, if we remember that <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> to evade the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd againſt him at <hi>Mentz,</hi> departed with ſome of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s workmen to <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> it will not appear improbable that ſome, who wrote at a diſtance, might confound him with thoſe ſervants, eſpecially conſidering that his name was never in any Book printed at <hi>Mentz.</hi> However 'tis plain that a place of one writer miſtaken by another, has been the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of leading many more, who have follow'd him implicitely, into the ſame error. An inſtance of this, which will be no digreſſion from our hiſtory, is as follows.</p>
                  <p>THE authors who have follow'd <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> from <hi>Sabellicus, Zurin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> &amp;c. down to <hi>Paul Pater,</hi> author of the treatiſe <hi>De Germaniae Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo</hi> [the Art of Printing] publiſh'd <hi>ann.</hi> 1709 have aſcrib'd this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>J. Regiomontanus,</hi> and thought they did the Art no ſmall honour, in making ſo great a Mathematician its author. What ſeem'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their opinion was, that <hi>Fauſt, Guttenbergh</hi> and he were contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, and 'tis probable, liv'd near each other; tho' he afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to <hi>Nurembergh.</hi> What made this ſtill more probable was, that <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> perfectly underſtood Mechanicks, ſo that, as it is ſaid, he made an iron Flyſpring from under his hand; fly round the room with a humming noiſe, and return back under his hand; he is likewiſe report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have made a wooden Eagle, which flew from <hi>Nurembergh</hi> to meet the Emperor, hover'd over his head in a tonick motion, and went back the ſame way with him. It would be dangerous now to aſſert the truth of theſe ſtories, ſince ſuch flights of ingenuity have been ſo long diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, to make way for more uſeful inventions; yet <hi>Jul. Scaliger</hi> was ſo far from doubting of them, that he pretends to have found out the Art, and bragg'd that he could perform the like with a wet finger. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this was ſufficient to perſuade our authors that <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo univerſal an artiſt, was moſt probably the perſon who invented
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0712300300:33"/>
the method of Printing, and communicated it to <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Guttenbergh;</hi> in conſequence of which they have plac'd him at the head of the other two. Nevertheleſs this notion ſeems to take its riſe from a paſſage in <hi>Purbach</hi>'s tables, wherein 'tis ſaid that the diſcovery of Printing is to be refer'd to the times of <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> as <hi>Malinkrot</hi> has fully prov'd. This ſtory, I hope, will both convince the reader of the danger of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing an author too implicitely, and juſtify my differin from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of thoſe who attribute the diſcovery to <hi>John Guttenbergh,</hi> whoſe opinion I apprehend to be ſufficiently confuted. Setting aſide this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of <hi>P. Ramus</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> he agrees with the reſt of our other teſtimonies in favour of <hi>Fauſt;</hi> and I conceive it to be not in the leaſt improbable, that the inventors might, in ſuch a variety of tools, implements, and other things neceſſary to the perfecting this Art, have recourſe to him or ſome other ingenious perſon, for advice and aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER it is certain that <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> was a very early printer, tho' not taken notice of as ſuch by any writer I have met with. I did indeed believe him to have been an aſſiſtant in perfecting of the Art, but never could meet with any ſufficient authority to fix the honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, till I was admitted into the Library of the Right Hon. the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> whom I beg leave to take this firſt opportunity of mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with honour and gratitude, not only for his great condeſcenſion in allowing me a free acceſs to his noble Collections of antient Editions, but likewiſe for ſeveral very curious hints upon this ſubject, which ſhall be mention'd in their proper places; here it was that his Lordſhip was pleas'd to ſhew me the following great curioſity, viz. <hi>Manilius</hi> in 4to. with theſe words at the end.</p>
                  <q>Ex Oſſicina <hi>Johannis de Regiomente</hi> in Nuremberg.</q>
                  <p>THE antiquity of this curious Edition ſhews it ſelf at firſt ſight, tho' there be no date to it, a circumſtance much to be lamented, tho' too common to many of thoſe antient monuments in the infancy of the Art. I muſt therefore be oblig'd to rank it with the reſt of theſe dateleſs works, of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak in the ſequel of this hiſtory: it is evident this is an older edition than that mention'd by <hi>Fabricius</hi> of 1474,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0712300300:34"/>
which 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe, not only by his being contemporary with, but aſſiſtant to, <hi>Fauſt</hi> in perfecting this art: however as <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> was a man of ſuch profound ſkill in aſtronomy, mechanicks, and ſeveral other branches of learning, I am willing to hope time will bring forth ſome further teſtimonies concerning him.</p>
                  <p>BUT what convinces me that he had no ſhare in the firſt diſcovery of the Art, is that in his long dedication prefix'd to his <hi>Aſtronomical Tables,</hi> the firſt piece he ever publiſh'd, which I have ſeen, and which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Primate of <hi>Hungary,</hi> he doth not make the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his having been concern'd in ſuch a noble diſcovery, which it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe he would have done, could he have claim'd ſuch a ſingular piece of merit to have recommended him to ſo great a patron; eſpecially when he expatiates ſo much upon the difficulties that attended the work he dedicates to him: but to return.</p>
                  <p>I apprehend a probable objection againſt the teſtimonies before quoted (which are ſcarce a fourth part of thoſe collected by <hi>Malinkrot,)</hi> that they are taken from <hi>Germans,</hi> who may be reaſonably ſuppos'd too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to their country, and conſequently leſs to be relied on than fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign writers, whoſe authority would be of far greater weight in this caſe. This I ſhall obviate by ſhewing, that learned authors of other nations are conſiſtent with the <hi>Germans</hi> in this particular. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cited two poets, the one an <hi>Italian,</hi> the other a <hi>Swede;</hi> the former of whom aſcribes this diſcovery to <hi>Germany,</hi> and the latter to <hi>John Fauſt</hi> of <hi>Mentz.</hi> My next deſign is to produce ſome of thoſe, who are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their enquiries into the antiquities of their own and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. At the head of theſe ſtands <hi>Polydore Vergil,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> who in his Book <hi>de Rerum Inventoribus,</hi> after an elegant encomium upon the Art, and a deſcription of its important benefits to mankind, proceeds thus <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Wherefore that the author of ſuch a diſcovery may not be depriv'd of his due praiſe, and that poſterity may know to whom we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted <note place="bottom">1 Quare tantae rei author non eſt ſua laude fraudandus, praeſertim ut poſteritas ſciat, cui divinum acceptum beneficium referre debeat.

for this divine gift; it was <hi>John Guttenbergh,</hi> by nation a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and a Knight, who firſt devis'd this Art of Printing Books in the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and began to practiſe it there, as we have been inform'd by the citizens themſelves; he is reported likewiſe to have made another diſcovery, <hi>viz.</hi> of a new kind of Ink, us'd now by all printers. Sixteen years after this, <hi>ann.</hi> 1457, one <hi>Conrad</hi> a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> brought it firſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c."</q>—Our author makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any but <hi>Guttenbergh;</hi> yet as he ſays the Art was firſt practis'd at <hi>Mentz,</hi> 'tis plain from what has been ſaid before, that he deſerv'd not the firſt name in this invention. The citizens who gave this account, were certainly thoſe that diſpers'd themſelves from <hi>Fauſt;</hi> who, though they learn'd the Art of him, yet might eſteem <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, becauſe he was moſt conſiderable; and not unlikely lorded it over the reſt, who he knew, could not carry on the buſineſs without his purſe; whilſt <hi>Fauſt,</hi> whoſe chief care was to conceal the Art, till he had reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burs'd himſelf ſo far as to be able to carry it on without his help, might let him enjoy the honour of the diſcovery in the mean time. What confirms my conjecture is, that if <hi>Conrad</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1457 he muſt have left <hi>Mentz</hi> before <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer</hi> had printed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books with their names. However in this caſe <hi>Fauſt</hi> would not be the only man, whoſe indigence and honeſty have been inducements to part with the credit of a beneficial diſcovery to a perſon of leſs merit, rather than to let it die with him, for want of means to carry it on.</p>

                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"This art [of Printing] is believ'd to have been firſt invented at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> about the year 1442. by <hi>John Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> knight; who began his firſt eſſays of it there, and found out a new ſort of ink, now us'd by the Printers: but there are ſome writers of opinion that this honour rather belong'd to <hi>John Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Ives</hi> [in latin <hi>Ivo] Schoeffer</hi> two years before that time, and affirm that <hi>Guttenbergh, John Mentel</hi> and others [whoſe names our author quotes out of <hi>Pantaleon]</hi> all <hi>Germans,</hi> improv'd afterwards the art, and divulg'd it in ſeveral parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> and at length carry'd it to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations. Others write that this art came originally from <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Cathai;</hi> but this aſſertion is without any foundation, ſeeing the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> were not diſcover'd by the <hi>Portugeſe</hi> till about 65 years ago; whereas Printing has been invented and practis'd ever ſince 1442. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Venetian-indeed</hi> gave the firſt deſcription of that country about 400 years ago, but made not the leaſt mention of Printing being us'd there. A confirmation of my opinion is, that the <hi>Greeks, Mingrelians, Abyſſines, Turks, Perſians, Moors, Arabs</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> write all their books by hand, this method was ordain'd in <hi>Turky</hi> by an edict of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> II. who prohibited the uſe of printed books under pain of death <hi>ann.</hi> 1483; which edict was confirm'd by <hi>Selim</hi> I. <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s ſon <hi>ann<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

oppoſite to <hi>Cathai,</hi> the one being in <hi>Aſia</hi> towards the ſouth, and the other in <hi>America</hi> towards the north-pole.

One fault however that nation labours under, which ſomewhat eclipſes their glory, which is, that they know not how, or at leaſt neglect to improve thoſe inventions, that were ſo eaſily found out by them."</q>—The author proceeds in an encomium up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the art and thoſe who rais'd it to greater perfection; but that belongs to another chapter.</p>
                  <p>I hope that the teſtimonies produc'd hitherto will be more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to fix the palm upon <hi>Fauſt</hi> and the city of <hi>Mentz;</hi> and that the reader will follow me with pleaſure to the next chapter, where they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by inconteſtable matters of fact.</p>

                  <p>IF the teſtimonies alledg'd in the preceding chapter are inſufficient to convince any perſon that this invention is due to <hi>Fauſt;</hi> what follows in this will, I conceive, put it quite out of doubt, unleſs he be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous in this caſe than a <hi>Dutchman:</hi> for the great <hi>Eraſmus</hi> has not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own'd himſelf convinc'd of this truth by one ſingle fact, but even tranſmitted it to poſterity. I ſhall therefore begin with that noble teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which is a privilege granted by the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> to <hi>John Schoeffer,</hi> grand-ſon of <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> not only for the ſole printing the works of <hi>T.

printed by him, in conſideration of his being grand-ſon to the firſt Inventor of the art of Printing: concerning whom <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who firſt publiſh'd that work, ſpeaks in his preface to it as follows: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If thoſe, who furniſh'd <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> with writers and parchments, have merited the higheſt commendation; what praiſe is due to Printers and Bookſellers, who ſupply us with whole volumes for a ſmall price? If <hi>Ptolemy Philadelphus</hi> acquir'd ſuch reputation, for collecting ſo great a library; what recompence can be made to thoſe, who furniſh us daily with books in all languages?

                  <p>I begin with that which is at the end of the <hi>Codex Pſalmorum,</hi> printed <hi>an.</hi> 1457, and conſequently the oldeſt book known to be printed with a date or inſcription.

                  <p>IT is unneceſſary to remark that the word <hi>Clerk [Clericus]</hi> doth not here ſignify a clergyman, for 'tis plain that <hi>Schoeffer</hi> was not ſo by his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s daughter, and leaving a ſon to ſucceed him; but it was uſual then to give that title to men of moderate literature.

                  <p>CONCERNING this bible ſome writers give us the following account, which is not a little in favour of <hi>Fauſt;</hi> that it was ſo like hand-writing, and the titles and capitals ſo finely painted on vellum, that <hi>Fauſt</hi> ſold ſome of them at <hi>Paris</hi> for a prodigious price: but the buyers finding a greater number upon him, than it was poſſible for ſeveral men to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

in their whole life, and the pages of each copy ſo exactly alike, that he was ſeiz'd, try'd and condemn'd for <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi> and was accordingly drag'd to the ſtake to be burnt; but upon diſcovering his Art, the parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> made an act to diſcharge him from all proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in conſideration of his admirable invention. However 'tis not a miſs to inform the reader, that his <hi>Black Art,</hi> for which he was ſo roughly treated, was printing his Bible on the <hi>Black Letter.</hi> I ſhall in its proper place give my reaſons for my opinion, that the bible, which <hi>Fauſt</hi> ſold for MS. was the firſt printed by him; in the mean time this proceſs againſt him, and his diſcharge from it by order of that Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of fact, it was not foreign to our purpoſe to mention it here.</p>

                  <p>THE like inſcription is at the end of the <hi>Breviarum Mindenſe,</hi> printed <hi>anno</hi> 1516, by the ſame perſon: In both which the reader will be pleas'd to obſerve, that there is not a word mention'd of <hi>John Guttenbergh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPON the whole 'tis my opinion, that were there no other evidence but theſe inſcriptions, they would be ſufficient to determine this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, ſeeing neither <hi>Harlem, Strasburgh,</hi> nor any other place can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing equivalent. Had <hi>Harlem,</hi> for inſtance, any ſuch authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick impreſſions in favour of <hi>Coſter,</hi> all other teſtimonies of the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for <hi>Mentz</hi> would have been rejected as inconſiderable: or if Dr. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> could have produc'd any ſingle book printed by his progenitor, of older or even equal date with the oldeſt of theſe, he would infallibly have triumph'd over all his antagoniſts. 'Tis certain that there is no book known to be printed at <hi>Harlem</hi> or any other place, of equal date with the laſt which were done by <hi>Fauſt,</hi> tho' it has been prov'd, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd printing near ten years before he put his name to his impreſſions: whence it follows, that he was not only the firſt Printer with fuſile me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal types, but likewiſe the firſt inventor of them, according to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies quoted in the preceding chapter.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but the reader is now willing to hear what methods the competitors with <hi>Fauſt</hi> take, in order to evade ſuch a cloud of authentick teſtimonies; and what arguments they can allege in defence of their claim: in ſhort, what grounds they have of triumphing in ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner. But I muſt here acquaint him, that if he expects evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence anſwerable to thoſe clamours, he will be extremely diſappointed in the two next chapters. However, ſince a controverſy cannot be fairly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0712300300:47"/>
decided, unleſs both parties be heard in their turn; I ſhall not deſire the reader to believe me implicitly, but propoſe their pretenſions in as juſt a light, and brief a manner as poſſible, together with the anſwers of <hi>Malinkrot</hi> and others to them; to which I ſhall take the liberty to add my own thoughts and obſervations, whether they chance to illuſtrate and confirm, or to contradict the concurrent teſtimony of the early, and the eſtabliſh'd notion, of the modern writers, upon the ſubject, and leave it to him to judge of the merit of the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>I hope what I ſaid laſt will not be look'd upon as either a piece of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or oſtentation in me: no man can be more ready, than I am, to own the great helps I have receiv'd from theſe great men, eſpecially from <hi>Malinkrot, Chevalier, Mattaire, Orlandi</hi> and ſome others of leſs note, or my own inſufficiency for ſuch a work as this, without ſuch an aſſiſtance; but tho' they are all great and learned men in their way, yet for want of a ſufficient acquaintance with the buſineſs of Printing, it was impoſſible for them not to overlook ſome things of moment, which a printer would eaſily diſcover at firſt ſight, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a book be MS. or printed; whether printed from pages of wood or with ſeparate types, in both which reſpects, many of them have been either puzled or miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: I ſhall add but one inſtance more, not foreign to our purpoſe; the famous Monſ. <hi>Naudé</hi> directed his readers how to know the books printed by <hi>Fauſt</hi> by the mark in the paper, which he calls the <hi>Heifer's Horns;</hi> Mr. <hi>Mattaire,</hi> who has been as curious and diligent as any one, tells us he could never obſerve that mark or any thing like it, whereas the very firſt book the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> ſhew'd me of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s printing, by holding a leaf againſt the light, the mark appear'd very plain; I ſhall beg leave to add, that the hints and helps I have had from the curious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and my acceſs to ſeveral noble libraries, have moreover enabled me to make many more curious obſervations, on this ſubject, than I could otherwiſe have done.

                  <p>I Have more than once hinted, that this controverſy in favour of <hi>Harlem</hi> was not ſtarted till above 125 years after the diſcovery of the art, when <hi>Hadrian Junius,</hi> M. D. began the diſpute. During that long interval, the invention was univerſally aſcribed to the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> tho' the names of the inventors were ſometimes confounded; and what ought to ſurpriſe us moſt of all is, that not one <hi>Dutch</hi> writer, during that time, ever offer'd to contradict the received opinion concerning <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Mentz;</hi> tho' many of them were men of great learning, and ſome either natives of <hi>Harlem,</hi> or had been educated in that univerſity. 'Tis really wonderful, that neither regard to truth, or their country's honour, nor the common ambition of being the author of a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, ſhould have inſpir'd ſome of them to undeceive the world in this point, if they had the leaſt grounds of ſuſpicion. But whatever be the reaſon of this unpardonable ſupineneſs in them, Dr. <hi>Junius,</hi> rather than fall under ſuch a charge, undertook a task, as difficult as that <hi>Egyptian</hi> one, of making brick without ſtraw. For from a collection of old traditions, wooden types, and two or three books, printed on wood, without name, date, or any other mark (by which it might be gueſs'd when, where, and by whom they were done), with ſome other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted relicks of the firſt eſſays of the art, he has form'd a ſtory, which he thinks will baffle all the teſtimonies urg'd on the other ſide, and turn the panegyricks, beſtow'd by the learned on the noble inventor, into the vileſt calumnies. As his ſtory is very prolix, and unneceſſary to be ſet down at length, the following abſtract may ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"THO' the glory of this art is entirely due to the city of <hi>Harlem;</hi> yet I am ſenſible how deep the contrary notion in favour of <hi>Mentz</hi> is rooted in the minds of men.—Were I bleſt with that eloquence which <hi>Carneades</hi> is ſo fam'd for, who never affirm'd any thing but what he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

prov'd, nor oppos'd any error, but what he clearly confuted; I might have juſt hopes to reduce this ſtol'n glory to its owner, and bring to light the truth, which has ſo long lain hid in <hi>Democritus</hi>'s well.—For if thoſe antients, who contended for the invention of letters, in behalf of their favourite heroes, have merited ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; what hinders but that I, influenc'd neither by partiality to one place, nor envy towards another, but with a ſincere love to truth, ſhould appear in ſo juſt a cauſe, which has been ſuffer'd to ſink for want of advocates?—And if <hi>Plutarch</hi> eſteems him the beſt evidence, who is not byaſs'd by favour or affection; I have a ſufficient claim to it, ſince none of <hi>Coſter</hi>'s poſterity can reward me for my performance. I ſhall therefore relate what has been told me by ſome grave and worthy old <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who have fill'd the beſt offices in the city, and heard it from others of equal weight and authority; <hi>viz.</hi> That about 128 years ago, there liv'd at a noted houſe, ſtanding to this day, over againſt the Royal Palace, one <hi>Laurence John,</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Coſter,</hi> (which word ſignifies a ſexton or church-warden; or, in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſenſe one who is intruſted with all the rich plate, ſumptuous robes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belonging to the pariſh church; a place hereditary in his family,) who was the perſon to whom the Art of Printing owes its original, tho' he has been unjuſtly depriv'd of that honour.—That walking by chance in an adjacent wood, according to cuſtom, after a full meal, or on holy-days, he cut ſome letters out of the bark of beech-trees; which being inverted and joyn'd together, he began to print ſome words, and then whole lines, in hopes that this might turn to the advantage of his grand-children: that the ſucceſs of this prompted him to greater diſcoveries, he being a man of an extraordinary geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: that he with <hi>Thomas Peter</hi> his ſon-in-law, finding the common ink apt to ſpread, invented a more glutinous ſort, and began to print whole pages; of which kind I ſaw ſome eſſays in an anonymous work, printed only on one ſide, and entitled the <hi>Mirour of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> written in <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> the white ſides of the paper being glew'd together to hide the chaſms: that after this he chang'd his wooden let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into lead; and then into tin, which was ſtill harder and more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: ſome of theſe old types being caſt into drinking-cups are ſtill

to be ſeen at the aforeſaid houſe, out of which <hi>Gerard Thomas, Coſter</hi>'s great-grand-ſon, dy'd a few years ago. But as all new inventions meet with encouragement, this art began to require a greater number of hands, which prov'd the firſt cauſe of miſchief to this family: for one of his ſervants nam'd <hi>John</hi> (but whether <hi>Fauſt</hi> or not I ſhall not now enquire) being employ'd in this buſineſs, after having taken an oath of ſecrecy, had no ſooner learn'd, as he thought, the method of caſting and joining the fuſile types, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he took the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of robbing his maſter of all his printing-tools, together with his art: to which end he choſe the night before <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> as the moſt proper for his deſign, when the whole family, with the reſt of the city were at church at midnight-maſs. Thence he eſcap'd to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> next to <hi>Cologn,</hi> and at laſt ſettled at <hi>Mentz;</hi> where the year following, <hi>viz. ann.</hi> 1442 he printed <hi>Alexandri Galli doctrinale,</hi> a grammar much in vogue at that time, with thoſe very types that his maſter <hi>Coſter</hi> had us'd before.
<p>THIS is the ſubſtance of what I had from thoſe gentlemen of vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, who told me they had it handed down by tradition; and this has been likewiſe confirm'd to me by others of equal repute. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have heard my tutor <hi>Nich. Gallius,</hi> an old gentleman of a very tenacious memory, ſay, that when he was a boy, he heard one <hi>Cornelius</hi> a printer, an old man, who had been one of <hi>Coſter</hi>'s workmen, mention the ſtory of the firſt trials of printing, with a great deal of vehemence, and even with tears, eſpecially when he came to the thieviſh part of it; proteſting he could execute the rogue himſelf with the utmoſt pleaſure, if he had been alive then; curſing thoſe nights, in which, for near three months together, he had lain with ſo vile a miſcreant. A ſtory like this one <hi>Quirinus Taleſius</hi> reports that he had heard from the ſame Printer.</p>
                        <p>THIS is what my ſincere love of truth oblig'd me to publiſh, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the conſequence be,—but I am fearful that prejudice in this caſe will out-balance reaſon and authority. The paſſing of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention into <hi>Germany</hi> in a lawful way had been no harm; nay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it pleaſed God to make it the means of perfecting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging ſo uſeful an art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</p>

HERE is all that our author could collect in defence of his cauſe, which he had made the beſt of after his way: it were indeed to be wiſh'd, the Doctor had rather imitated the modeſty of <hi>Carneades,</hi> than wiſh'd for his eloquence; ſince that great philoſopher (however he ſeems to forget it) never was known to affirm any thing. Convinc'd as he was of the weakneſs of human underſtanding, and of the power of prejudice; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contented himſelf with confuting the opinions of others, without ever ſhewing that he held any of his own: but ſuch an excellent talent would have ſpoil'd his deſign, and condemn'd both his book and his old men's fables to obſcurity and oblivion, and ſaved ſome other authors the trouble of writing in the vindication of either; but tho' he has been follow'd by about a dozen of his country-men, yet no additional teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are to be expected from any of them: for even <hi>Boxhorn,</hi> who wrote with the greateſt vehemence and ſpleen againſt <hi>Malinkrot,</hi> has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to content himſelf with palliating the account of <hi>Junius,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſhew, that it is not quite ſo improbable as his antagoniſt hath repreſented it. However it muſt be owned, that except the two laſt nam'd authors, and one or two more, <hi>viz.

It would be ſuperfluous to multiply quotations out of the writers on the ſide of <hi>Harlem,</hi> ſince they follow <hi>Junius</hi> upon his bare teſtimony; and a confutation of him will eaſily diſpatch all the reſt. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine the probability of his account, and ſee how far it outweighs, the teſtimonies and authorities alleg'd on the other ſide: in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, the beſt method will be to follow the ſteps of the learned <hi>Malinkrot,</hi> who has ſufficiently expos'd the numerous abſurdities, which this ſtory is attended with.

Such a night as that, wherein the inhabitants of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were going to or coming from maſs, was by no means proper for ſuch a deſign; and ſuppoſing he might have paſs'd undiſturb'd with his ſtollen
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0712300300:53"/>
treaſure, yet he could not with the ſame facility paſs thro' the gates, or leap over the walls, with at leaſt a thouſand weight of letters on his back: or if his booty was thoſe wooden planks, with which the two large books mention'd before were printed, as ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> writers ſeem to hint againſt <hi>Junius,</hi> it was ſufficient to load two or three carts: that he ſhould go with them to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> then to <hi>Cologn,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>Mentz,</hi> without being taken notice of, is no leſs aſtoniſhing. I ſhall not inſiſt upon his raſhneſs in chuſing to go thro' ſuch publick roads and noted ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thereby running the danger of being ſeized; the conſequence of which would have been capital puniſhment: nor upon the unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſupineneſs of his maſter in not purſuing nor cauſing him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, when he open'd ſhop at <hi>Mentz,</hi> where he could eaſily have reach'd him: nor yet upon the probability, that the publick muſt have been obliged, by this daring attempt of robbing the country of ſuch a glorious diſcovery, to proſecute the robber with the utmoſt ſeverity where ever he could be found.</p>
                  <p>IN the next place ſhould we grant that <hi>Fauſt,</hi> or ſome other ſervants had ſtollen the types; does it neceſſarily follow that he carry'd away the art with them? Could neither <hi>Coſter,</hi> nor his ſon-in-law and aſſiſtant <hi>Tho. Peter,</hi> nor any of his grand-children, recover a new preſs, caſt new types, and publiſh ſomething that might expoſe the thief, and ſhew to whom the world was indebted for this invention? Beſides, it appears from <hi>Junius</hi> that ſome of the types were left behind, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards transformed into drinking-veſſels: if theſe were not ſufficient to ſet them to work again, the interval of ten years, <hi>viz.</hi> from the pretended robbery <hi>anno</hi> 1441, to the divulging of the art <hi>anno</hi> 1452, was more than enough to have compleated a new ſet; ſeeing the firſt inventors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, try'd, and perfected this method in leſs time. But 'tis urg'd that <hi>Coſter</hi> dy'd either of grief or otherwiſe before he had brought the art to any perfection; ſo that <hi>Harlem</hi> was anticipated by <hi>Mentz.</hi> This is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Majolus</hi> and <hi>Quadi,</hi> tho' without grounds; for <hi>Junius</hi> tells us, that he invented the ſeparate metal types, as well as wooden-blocks; and met with ſuch encouragement that people came far and near to purchaſe his books, tho' at very dear rates: now if he was alive, as <hi>he</hi> and <hi>Berki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> relate, <hi>anno</hi> 1447, ſix years after this pretended flight; during that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval

he might have renew'd his works, there being no want of buyers, and inſcrib'd his books after this or ſome ſuch manner; <hi>This work was done at</hi> Harlem <hi>by</hi> L. J. Coſter, <hi>the inventor of this art of printing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and not by that notorious pretender</hi> John Fauſt, <hi>who ſtole my art and inſtruments, and is ſet up at</hi> Mentz, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But nothing of this nature was ever done by <hi>Coſter</hi> or his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; which is a plain indication that this whole ſtory is, what <hi>Salmuth</hi> and other learned writers affirm it to be, a mere old wife's fable without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or even probability. How the deviſers and publiſhers of it can maintain it with ſo much poſitiveneſs and vehemence, with ſuch calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, invectives and ill language, againſt perſons of incomparable learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who could not give into ſuch an abſurd and legendary account, is not my buſineſs to enquire. I ſhall only obſerve, that their charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man of ſuch conſpicuous merit as <hi>John Fauſt</hi> recoils with double force and ſhame upon themſelves; for it proves them guilty of a crime more flagrant than what they accuſe him of, in endeavouring to deprive him not only of the glory of that invention, in order to fix it upon an imaginary country-man of theirs; but even of what is moſt valuable in the world, his reputation, upon the bare teſtimony and tradition of three old citizens, whoſe memory is as juſtly queſtionable, as their and <hi>Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s impartiality, in a caſe wherein the honour of their city and fellow-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens is concern'd; and what is ſtill a greater aggravation of their unjuſt calumny, to make uſe of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s noble diſcovery to publiſh and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his ſhame, whoſe honour and memory ought rather to have been ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by it: little did that good man think, that his art would ever be put to ſo vile a uſe againſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>IN the mean time, I muſt not omit to remark, that of all the writers, whom we have quoted for <hi>Mentz,</hi> and of many more collected by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent <hi>Malinkrot</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of Printing,</hi> there is not one native of that city. <hi>Munſter</hi> indeed was born near it, but educated at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and <hi>Serrarius,</hi> tho' he liv'd ſometime there, was born in <hi>Lorain;</hi> yet if ſuch an objection had been juſt againſt ten or twelve of 'em, there remains enough to fix the laurel on <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s head. But with reſpect to the old evidences of <hi>Harlem,</hi> we only know what <hi>Junius</hi> is pleas'd to tell us of them, that they were perſons who ſerv'd ſeveral conſiderable offices in the city. However <hi>Malinkrot</hi> makes a very ſhrewd remark upon one of:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0712300300:55"/>
them, <hi>viz. Cornelius</hi> the Printer, who in a ſally of paſſion wiſh'd <hi>Fauſt</hi> had been then alive, that he might have executed him with his own hands; and was at that time, as <hi>Junius</hi> relates, above eighty years old: now as this theft is pretended to have been committed <hi>anno</hi> 1441, and it appears from an edition of <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>offices</hi> that <hi>Fauſt</hi> was living <hi>anno</hi> 1466; it is plain that in this ſpace of 25 years <hi>Cornelius</hi> might have had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of gratifying his revenge upon him if he had thought fit. This circumſtance therefore, which was contriv'd to add weight to the ſtory, ſerves only to burleſque and overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>I fear the reader is more weary of this argument than I could wiſh; ſince there are two or three new allegations out of thoſe who followed <hi>Junius,</hi> which tho' of ſmall weight, I would willingly examine before I diſmiſs this chapter; tho' it were only to ſhew what ſhifts they are driven to, who undertake to ſupport the credit of <hi>Junius</hi>'s legend; and to let the world judge whether ſuch arguments are not more likely to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw than maintain this cauſe.

began to be exercis'd at <hi>Mentz</hi> by <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> who was the grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>John Schoeffer</hi> (a printer of this age,) and worthy the higheſt encomiums."</q> In another place (in the beginning of the 4th book) there is the following elegant panegyrick upon the art and inventor:—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"that at the decline of the world, when the laſt day ſeem'd to approach, ſo many men of accompliſh'd learning and ſingular piety ſhould break forth, like bright ſtars, with unuſual luſtre thro' the tempeſtuous clouds of deadly diſcord; ſo that you would have thought the world had been recover'd from a long diſeaſe, and gradually reaſſumed its loſt ſtrength, the arts and ſciences: this was effected by the aſſiſtance of that art, which from metal characters of letters ingeniouſly caſt, diſpos'd in the order in which we write, ſpread over with a convenient quantity of ink, and put under the preſs, has uſher'd into the world, books in all languages, and multiplied their copies like a numerous off-ſpring, and has obtain'd the name of Typography.

                  <p>AS the reader may reaſonably think, there is ſomething exceilent in theſe Books, either for beauty of impreſſion, learning, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the great noiſe which they have made among the writers of this controverſy; I muſt begin with acquainting him that their whole merit conſiſts only in their being look'd upon by them as the very firſt eſſays of the art of printing, even before the invention of fuſile types. This is ſo far from admitting of any controverſy, however ſome of them may have been miſled into a contrary opinion, that their being print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only on one ſide of the paper, and afterwards glew'd together, on the blank ſide, from which they were call'd <hi>paginae conglutinatae,</hi> is a very pregnant proof of their being done after the firſt method, <hi>viz.</hi> upon wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en blocks; tho'we ſhall not only corroborate the fact by many other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable arguments in the ſequel of this chapter, but even lead the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into ſo plain a method of judging of thoſe works, from thoſe printed by fuſile types, that he will not have the leaſt room left to doubt of it.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Donatus,</hi> ſo ſtrenuouſly inſiſted upon, by <hi>Bertius</hi> and others, in favour of <hi>Harlem,</hi> it is a queſtion whether there be one copy of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſeeing 'tis not to be met with in any of thoſe curious libraries I have either ſeen or heard of, nor could ever be procured by any of our ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into theſe antient monuments, tho' they have ſpar'd neither pains nor coſt to have it ſought for far and near: to which let me add, that no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor I am acquainted with, has pretended to have ſeen it, if we except <hi>Angel Rocha,</hi> who in his <hi>Bibliotheca Vaticana,</hi> printed at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1591, <hi>4to.</hi> pag. 411, tells us, that <hi>Aldus Manutius, jun<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> ſhew'd him a grammar of <hi>Donatus</hi> printed on vellum, upon one of the firſt white leaves of which <hi>Mariangelus Accurſius,</hi> a learned author living in <hi>Italy</hi> about the year 1500 had wrote, as he ſuppos'd, with his own hand, the following words in latin, <q rend="inline">"that this <hi>Donatus,</hi> and another book entitled <hi>Conſeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0712300300:61"/>
were the firſt printed books, and that <hi>John Fauſt</hi> citizen of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and firſt inventor of the Art of Printing, had printed them <hi>ann.</hi> 1450,"</q> as has been ſaid in the laſt chapter.</p>
                  <p>FROM this account of <hi>Accurſius</hi> it is plain: <hi>firſt,</hi> that this <hi>Donatus</hi> bore neither date nor name of place or printer, otherwiſe he need not to have been at the trouble of gueſſing at them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Donatus</hi> is the name of the author, not of the book; and that it was only a grammar for boys, for ſo <hi>Rocha</hi> calls it in the place before quoted; to which we may add, that in the laſt liſt which the firſt Printers at <hi>Rome</hi> gave of their works to the Pope, they call it <hi>Donatus pro pueris;</hi> ſo that it could not be ſuch a trifling thing as ſome authors have thought it, who only call it a Primer. The <hi>third</hi> thing I would obſerve from this paſſage is, that <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> who is here call'd the firſt inventor of printing, is affirm'd to have printed it at <hi>Mentz:</hi> but what has puzled the world is, what the ſame author adds at the end of the paſſage, <hi>viz. that</hi> Fauſt <hi>did certainly take the hint from the</hi> Donatus <hi>in</hi> Holland, <hi>firſt printed on Blocks of wood;</hi> which for that very reaſon, thoſe authors who have follow'd him, have thought fit to make 10 years older, and have ſuppos'd them printed about the year 1440. I might indeed have omitted this paſſage, ſeeing <hi>Accurſius</hi> ſeems to hint that this book of his was printed by fuſile types; but as it was the only one that has been ſeen by any author, and confirms ſome of our former aſſertions, I thought it would not be amiſs to inſert it, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering that it was not impoſſible for <hi>Accurſius</hi> to be miſtaken in his judgment, of its being printed after the new method of ſeparate types, as many other learned men have been in the like caſe. The merit of this quotation has been examin'd in the laſt chapter, and it is plain that all the authors that have mention'd the date of this book, ſuch as <hi>Beughen, Boxhorn, Bertius,</hi> and others have taken it upon truſt, as well as what they affirm of its being done upon wooden blocks, ſince none of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend either to have ſeen it, or to have taken it from any author that had: and if we ſhould admit what <hi>Accurſius</hi> affirms, that thoſe ſuppos'd <hi>dutch ones</hi> were older than this he wrote upon, it will make it ſtill plainer that they had neither date, printer, nor place's name; ſince this, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd ten years younger, is without any of them. The ſame may be ſaid of the other books I am now going to give an account of, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0712300300:62"/>
                     <hi>Speculum, Ars moriendi,</hi> &amp;c. which are in the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s curious collection, none of which, tho' they ſeem to be improvements of one another, has the leaſt mention of time, place, or printer.</p>
                  <p>However, as to their being engraven upon wooden blocks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently being the firſt eſſays, or as ſome antiquaries call them, the firſt <hi>Maculatures</hi> of the art, I am fully convinc'd, both by the ink with which they are printed, <hi>viz.</hi> the common writing ink, and by ſome undoubted trials I have made of them. I ſhall therefore lay down the following rules to diſtinguiſh between books printed on blocks of wood and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate metal types.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let an <hi>m, w,</hi> or any other remarkable letter, be curiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd both as to its length, breadth and ſhape, and compare it with the ſame letter in another word, if they vary either in ſimilitude or ſize, you may be aſſur'd they are not metal types, ſince the moſt curious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-cutter, writing-maſter, or engraver, cannot make any two letters ſo alike, but a nice obſerver will diſtinguiſh one from the other: on the contrary, in ſeparate metal types each letter being caſt in the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, it is impoſſible there ſhould be the leaſt difference either in ſhape or ſize.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another way is by chooſing any word, the longer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, take the length of it with the points of the compaſs, and compare it with the ſame word in another place, and if you find them both of the ſame length, you may depend upon their being printed with ſeparate metal types; for as each letter is caſt in the ſame mould, it is impoſſible that their length ſhould vary: but in writing and engraving there will be a viſible difference in the ſame word in various places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Meaſure the length of a page; tell the number of lines in a full one, and take the white ſpaces between each line, and by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to any other full page in the book, if they are printed with metal types there can be no variation in any of theſe reſpects: whereas, if they were done in wood it would be as impoſſible for them to agree in any one inſtance, as it would be to engrave or write any two pages wherein there ſhould be no viſible variation in ſome one or more of the foremention'd particulars. It was by theſe methods that I diſtinguiſh'd, in the <hi>ſive</hi> books in the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s <hi>Library,</hi> what was done on wood, and what by ſeparate metal types.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0712300300:63"/>
MELCHIOR ADAMUS, and after him the learned <hi>Malinkrot</hi> and ſome others, tell us of ſeparate wooden types cut with a knife, which were us'd by the firſt Printers, before the diſcovery of caſting them into metal; but beſides that this ſeems inconſiſtent with the moſt authentick teſtimonies we have quoted hitherto concerning this invention: whoever conſiders the vaſt time and trouble it would require to cut ſuch a quantity of them as is neceſſary to print any moderate work, the great difficulty of making them ſtand exactly upright and even in line and body, how liable they would be to ſplit, break, warp, ſhrink and ſwell with continual wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and the weight of the preſs, with many more ſuch like inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and difficulties, will eaſily judge, not only of the abſurdity of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo of the impoſſibility of any of thoſe old books being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any ſuch types; ſince it is obvious to every eye, that no one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle work could have come perfect out of their hands for the reaſons above-mention'd.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this point, I muſt not omit acquainting the Reader with a miſtake into which <hi>Chevillier</hi> has been unwarily drawn, even when he took the ſureſt method of coming at the truth, concerning one of theſe books in queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Speculum Salutis,</hi> he tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 281 and 282 of his <hi>Origin of Printing,</hi> that having one of them in his own poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having met with another in the library of the <hi>Celeſtin</hi> Monks at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had the curioſity to have them examined by a Printer, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and an Engraver, who judg'd them to be printed with ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metal-types; ſo that thoſe who have read his book, have thought it a ſufficient ground to alter their opinion of their being done on wooden blocks. But this miſtake of <hi>Chevillier</hi>'s proceeded from his not examining the whole book, becauſe as I ſhall ſhew anon, there were many leaves ſupply'd afterwards by ſeparate metal types, one of which he had the misfortune to light upon, otherwiſe they muſt have manifeſtly ſeen the difference</p>
                  <p>I come now to give the reader an account of the other <hi>five</hi> books, <hi>viz. Ars Moriendi,</hi> the <hi>Hiſtory of the Apocalypſe,</hi> the <hi>Hiſtory of the Bible,</hi> the <hi>Speculum Salutis,</hi> and the <hi>Spiegel</hi> or <hi>Speculum</hi> tranſlated into <hi>Low Dutch.</hi> That theſe however are not all that was done upon wooden planks, is plain, becauſe <hi>Trithemius</hi> tells us of the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> firſt printed upon wood,

                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks of a <hi>Pſalter</hi> of the ſame ſtamp, which his grand-mother had, and other antiquaries mention ſeveral others not worth inſerting here, all which are either periſh'd, or are as yet undiſcover'd: however I cannot omit the <hi>Speculum,</hi> and ſome others ſeen by <hi>Saubert</hi> in the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg</hi> library, of which he was keeper; and mention'd by him in the catalogue of that library, call'd in latin <hi>Bibliotheca Norica,</hi> which books were printed in <hi>High Dutch,</hi> and may juſtly be ſuppos'd ſome of <hi>Fauſtus</hi>'s firſt <hi>Tentamina</hi> or eſſays from <hi>ann.</hi> 1440 to 1450: but as that author has only given us the names, without any further account of them; I ſhall paſs them by, and return to the <hi>five</hi> abovementioned; which are no where to be met with together, but in that noble Collection of the Right Hon. the Earl of <hi>Pembroke:</hi> and as no one beſides my ſelf has deſcrib'd them all, I hope the reader will not be diſpleas'd, if I give him a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of them, than any but a Printer could poſſibly have done: They are all <hi>five</hi> printed on a very ſmall <hi>Folio.</hi>

IT is a moral treatiſe upon the ſubject of dying well, with wooden cuts ſuited to the taſte of the Romiſh church; a ſick man is figur'd lying in his bed with angels and devils attending him, the one to tempt, the other to ſtrengthen him; to which end the deſigner has made labels from their mouths, to expreſs the intention of each: the deſigns of this firſt book are ſomewhat better drawn than thoſe of the reſt; for in that age, as well as ours, there were good and bad painters or deſigners, but the preſs-work is the worſt of the <hi>five:</hi> this induces me to think this piece to be the oldeſt, and its wanting the ſeveral improvements which we find in the others, does not a little confirm me in my conjecture: for <hi>firſt,</hi> it is printed with common writing ink without any gum, which is plain from its ſpreading it ſelf, and ſoaking into the paper, ſo that in many places it is ſcarce legible; and the ink is grown withall ſo pale by length of time, that it doth but juſt ſhow it ſelf at the beſt: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it ſeems to have received ſeveral degrees of improvement as the work went on, and is better printed, and with better ink, the nearer it draws to the end: the <hi>third</hi> circumſtance that proves its priority to the reſt, is, that it hath

THIS book, which I venture to give the ſecond rank to, hath the advantage of being printed with better ink than the former, which makes it much more legible; it appears to have ſome gum diſſolv'd with the ink, which was one of the firſt improvements that was made to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of ink; it has likewiſe the ſignatures at the top of each page of the ſheet: This piece contains the hiſtory of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> in forty ſix pages, each having ſome figures ill cut, repreſenting ſome part of that ſaint's life; the cuts are interſpers'd with ſhort ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, arguments and explications, in Monkiſh latin proſe; likewiſe cut in wood after an indifferent manner; the paper has the mark of the <hi>heif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer's LABEL and horns,</hi> which is allowed to be the mark in the paper <hi>Fauſt</hi> uſed.</p>

THIS is only a tranſlation of the <hi>Speculum Salutis</hi> into <hi>Flemiſh:</hi> it was upon this book that Dr. <hi>Junius</hi> and the other <hi>dutch</hi> writers, who have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, lay ſo great a ſtreſs; and upon whoſe antiquity, preferable to all others, they ground their claim to the invention of printing in favour of <hi>Coſter.</hi> However it is very plain that the <hi>Latin</hi> one is prior to this, and that <hi>this</hi> is only a tranſlation of <hi>that,</hi> becauſe the wooden cuts are the ſame in both, the latin explanations at the bottom are left untranſlated, and the cuts are printed with the ſame pale gum'd writing ink as in the <hi>Latin</hi> one, rather brown than black; whereas the body of this work is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with ſeparate metal types, and printed with an ink as remarkable for its blackneſs as any ſort ſince made uſe of: it has alſo in ſeveral places the ſame mark in the paper, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>heiffer's LABEL and horns,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by Monſ. <hi>Naudé</hi> to be the mark in <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s paper. In the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Speculum</hi> a great many pages are ſupply'd with the ſame ſeparate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal types, preſs-work and ink as the body of this whole <hi>Flemiſh</hi> one; and has all the appearances ſufficient to convince any one, of its being done at the ſame time, and by the ſame hand; one of which <hi>ſupply'd</hi> pages of the latin <hi>Speculum, Chevillier</hi> happen'd to pitch upon, when he ſhew'd it to the Printer, Founder and Engraver before mention'd. There is one circumſtance worth noting, which is, that the <hi>Speculum ſalutis,</hi> tho' cut on wood, each page conſiſts of two diſtinct pieces, the LABEL piece is the draught or repreſentation of the hiſtory, the lower piece is the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry itſelf in two columns, and if I may venture to account for this motled
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0712300300:67"/>
work, it muſt be by ſuppoſing, that after they had cut the deſign, they might print ſeveral proof ſheets, as is uſual now, to ſee if it needed any amendment; which proof ſheets of the draughts only, together with a compleat book of the latin <hi>Speculum,</hi> might afterwards fall into the hands of ſome <hi>dutch Printer,</hi> who got it tranſlated into <hi>low dutch</hi> and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with ſeparte metal types upon the ſame proof ſheets under the deſigns which were before printed at the LABEL of the page; and this will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear from the manifeſt difference of the ink, as before mention'd.</p>
                  <p>THERE remain ſtill two points to be examin'd with relation to the <hi>Donatus;</hi> 1. whether it be the firſt book printed with wooden planks; 2. whether it was done by <hi>L. Coſter</hi> at <hi>Harlem.</hi> To the firſt there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the teſtimonies of <hi>Ulric Zel</hi> citizen of <hi>Cologn,</hi> who relates what was done almoſt fifty years ago, and of <hi>Mar. Accurſius,</hi> who wrote in <hi>Italy</hi> what he heard was done at, a ſtill, greater diſtance from him. To theſe, who could not poſſibly be acquainted with every circumſtance of this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, we may reaſonably oppoſe the authority of <hi>Trithemius;</hi> for he learn'd what he tells us, not from report and uncertain tradition, but from the mouth of <hi>Peter Schoeffer,</hi> who related nothing but what he was an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of, or rather particularly intereſted in. Now <hi>Trithemius</hi> aſcribes the invention of wooden blocks to <hi>J. Fauſt;</hi> and aſſerts that the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi> was the firſt book (of any conſequence) printed in that manner; and that his next ſtep was the more ingenious invention of ſeparate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal types.</p>
                  <p>LET the world judge whether his teſtimony be not far preferable to that of the two former. <hi>Scriverius</hi> indeed, and after him Mr. <hi>Beughen,</hi> affirm the <hi>Donatus</hi> to have been printed <hi>anno</hi> 1440; but give no reaſon for their fixing on that year rather than any other; and it is manifeſt from what they ſay before, that they only proceed upon a ſuppoſition, that this method being diſcovered about that time; this book (which is perhaps the leaſt conſiderable of thoſe which were printed then) might be one of the firſt eſſays of it. However let the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> the <hi>Donatus</hi> or any other, be the firſt book printed in <hi>Europe</hi> with wooden planks, yet there is no ground of boaſting it to be the firſt in the world; ſince the <hi>Chineſe</hi> practis'd that way of Printing at leaſt 300 years before either <hi>Fauſt</hi> or <hi>Coſter</hi> were born.</p>

THE next conſideration is, where and by whom it was printed. The <hi>Dutch</hi> attempt two ways of proving it was done by <hi>Coſter</hi> at <hi>Harlem:</hi> the firſt is that of <hi>Junius,</hi> who pretends that it was one of the firſt tryals of <hi>Coſter</hi>'s metal types; but this has been ſo fully confuted, that they have been oblig'd to recur to another ſhift; which is, that <hi>Coſter</hi> invented the engraven planks, and with theſe printed the <hi>Donatus</hi> and <hi>Speculum Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi> and that from this <hi>Fauſt</hi> took the hint of inventing metal types, an improvement of the former method <note n="1" place="bottom">Alibi enim ars, alibi ornamenta artis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venta; illa inter <hi>Hollandos,</hi> haec inter <hi>Germaniae Moguntinos.—Harlemum Tipographiae</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut matrem, <hi>Mogunt am</hi> autem nutricem fuiſſe &amp; alumnam; ibi ſuperatum quicquid in novae rei exordiis impeditum, hic additam majorem arti ſpeciem &amp; facilitatem. <hi>Boxhorn de Art.

The learned <hi>Saubert</hi> likewiſe tells us in his <hi>Hiſtory of the</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimbergh <hi>library,</hi> that he hath ſeen ſeveral books there printed in <hi>high dutch</hi> after this manner, one of which is the <hi>Speculum</hi> 
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">Quae ligno inciſa ſunt, huc non refero, v. g. libellum fabularum &amp; ſimilitudinum, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eſt <hi>D.

Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</hi> p. 116.</note>. Who can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determine which is the moſt antient, or where they were printed? If the <hi>Dutch</hi> one could be done no where but in <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe it is in <hi>low dutch;</hi> by parity of reaſon the <hi>high dutch</hi> muſt have been printed in <hi>Germany;</hi> and as to the <hi>Latin,</hi> it will remain ſtill undetermin'd, whether it was done in the one or the other, and nothing will be certain concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, except that it muſt have been printed before the tranſlations. From the whole of what has been ſaid, it is apparent, that all the proofs which the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring either from facts or authentick writers, confute, rather than ſupport, their pretenſions: and I hope by this time the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Fauſt</hi> is ſufficiently clear'd from the two fold wrong done it by thoſe, who endeavour to deprive him of his due honour, and aſperſe him with the vileſt accuſations of treachery and theft: and that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

not only eſteems him acquitted of both, but is ſatisfy'd that neither <hi>Coſter</hi> nor <hi>Harlem</hi> have the leaſt ſhare in this diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I conclude this chapter, I cannot omit a conjecture of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Mr. <hi>Mattaire,</hi> which will be a conſiderable confirmation of what has been ſaid before.

                  <p>WITH reſpect to this chronicle and the writer of it, we only know what our author tells us in his tranſlation inſerted at the bottom of the page, for the chronicle is written in <hi>high dutch.</hi> As it wants therefore ſome better authority for its ſupport, Dr. <hi>Mentel</hi> brings, as a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, the teſtimonies of the writers quoted in our third chapter, who make mention of <hi>Guttenberg</hi>'s carrying the art from <hi>Strasburgh</hi> to <hi>Mentz,</hi> where he perfected it by the aſſiſtance of <hi>John Fauſt</hi> alias <hi>Gensfleich;</hi> whoſe words are not therefore neceſſary to be repeated here. In the next place he alledges an inſcription, which with <hi>Mentel</hi>'s coat of arms was put at the beginning of <hi>Otho Brunsfield</hi>'s <hi>Onomaſticon</hi> printed at <hi>Strasburgh</hi> by <hi>John Schott anno</hi> 1543, importing <note n="1" place="bottom">Inſigne <hi>Schottorum</hi> familiae ab <hi>Frederico Romanorum</hi> III imperatore <hi>Jeanni Mentelin</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Typographiae inventori, ac ſuis conceſſum anno 1466. p. 104.</note>, that theſe arms of <hi>Schott</hi>'s family had been given to <hi>John Mentelin,</hi> firſt inventor of the art of Printing, and to his poſterity by the Emperor <hi>Frederic</hi> III. <hi>anno</hi> 1466. After this he gives us a <hi>latin</hi> epigram written by <hi>Erhard Windsberg</hi> and inſcrib'd to the three famous <hi>Germans,</hi> who ſet up the firſt Printing-preſs at <hi>Paris.</hi> In the firſt verſe of this he has thought fit to change the word <hi>Alemannia (Germany)</hi> for theſe of <hi>tu Argentina (thou Strasburgh)</hi> as more proper for his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>THE book, at the end of which are theſe verſes, is the <hi>Epiſtles of</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes <hi>the Cynick,</hi> printed by <hi>Martin Crantz</hi> and his two partners beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>anno</hi> 1470, not at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> as our author would fain inſinuate to his readers, but at <hi>Paris;</hi> where it is ſtill extant in the library of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> and was ſeen among others by <hi>Chevillier,</hi> who has occaſionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed <hi>Mentel</hi>'s ſuppoſition, and expos'd his unfair quotation of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, pag. 31. of his <hi>Hiſtory of Printing;</hi> as we ſhall ſhew in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>THIS is all that I can find in <hi>Mentel's</hi> book, which has the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of argument: the reſt conſiſts chiefly in digreſſions, and quotations in praiſe of the art, and of the <hi>German</hi> nation; which are entirely foreign
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0712300300:73"/>
to this controverſy. In ſhort our author ſhews himſelf more deſirous of appearing zealous for his anceſtor's honour, than ſolicitous what credit his work will merit among the learned: I ſhall give an inſtance or two of this, and proceed to the confutation of his main arguments.</p>
                  <p>IN page 31, he gives us a piece of a comedy written by the famous <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> poet <hi>Nicodemus Friſchlin;</hi> but is pleas'd to overlook the lines quoted by us before at p. 19, in which he affirms, <hi>John Fauſt</hi> citizen of <hi>Mentz</hi> to have been the inventor of the art; tho' they are at a very ſmall diſtance from the paſſage quoted by him; what is ſtill more remarkable is, that <hi>Mentel</hi> affirms that our <hi>Swediſh</hi> poet dedicated this dramatic piece to the ſenate of <hi>Strasburgh;</hi> which he would ſcarce have done, had he dreamt any thing of that city's claiming the glory of this invention againſt his Hero <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> or heard any thing of the charge of theft alledg'd againſt him by the <hi>Strasburgers.</hi> The other inſtance of his unfairneſs is no leſs conſiderable at <hi>p.</hi> 67; where having ſuppos'd that the <hi>Rationale Durandi</hi> was not printed 'till after the falling out of <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> viz. <hi>ann.</hi> 1461, to evade the force of the real date 1459, he ſays with a very ſerious air, that he had credible information from men of great learning, both Printers and others, that it was wrong printed, and that the figure I, which is put before, ſhould have been after the X, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of MCCCCLIX, it ſhould have been MCCCCLXI: whereas Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> aſſures us <note n="1" place="bottom">Vide quaeſo <hi>Mentelii</hi> in opinione falſa ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinati, ipſiuſque hominum ornatiſſimorum hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucinationem manifeſtam; annus enim illius li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri exprimitur non numeralibus litteris, ſed diſertis verbis. <hi>Milleſime quadringenteſimo quinquage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0712300300:74"/>
latter was never printed in any book that could yet be produc'd. What is ſaid will ſuffice, I hope, to give an idea of this author's ſincerity, whoſe three principal authorities I ſhall now examine.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, as to the <hi>Strasburgh</hi> chronicle, we may reaſonably be excus'd for not laying the ſame ſtreſs upon it, that our author doth; ſince the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the writer, a ſuſpicion of his partiality for his country's honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and a difficulty of believing a perſon in his own cauſe in oppoſition to a great number of more credible witneſſes, are obſtacles almoſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. I am therefore inclin'd to think, that the bare oppoſing of the chronicle of <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Trithemius,</hi> who aſſert that the art was firſt brought from <hi>Mentz</hi> to <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> will be a ſufficient confutation of it, tho' there were no other authorities for the one, nor arguments againſt the other. However we have an unexceptionable witneſs to produce againſt this chronicle, <hi>viz.</hi> the learned <hi>Wimpheling,</hi> who was not only an eminent ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> and almoſt contemporary with the diſcovery of the art, but is likewiſe quoted by Dr. <hi>Mentel,</hi> tho' his teſtimony be diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to his purpoſe: the firſt part of the paſſage is ſet down at length in <hi>pag.</hi> 15, wherein he attributes the whole invention to <hi>John Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbergh;</hi> and tells us that he did not perfect it 'till he had been ſometime at <hi>Mentz;</hi> whilſt <hi>John Mentel</hi> undertaking the ſame buſineſs, printed a great many volumes very neat and correct, and grew exceeding rich in a ſhort time <note n="1" place="bottom">Interea <hi>Joannes Mentel</hi> id opiſicii genus incoeptans, multa volumina caſtigate &amp; polite imprimendo factus eſt brevi opulentiſſimus. <hi>Wimphel loco <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </note>. This is all that <hi>Wimpheling</hi> ſays of <hi>Mentel;</hi> nor has any author, except that of this <hi>Strasburg</hi> chronicle, mention'd or ſuppos'd him to be the inventor, but only one of the firſt that practis'd that art at <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> and if the reader will recollect what moſt of the writers, quoted in the <hi>third</hi> chapter of this book, have ſaid concerning <hi>Guttenbergh</hi>'s leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mentz</hi> and returning to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> where ſome of them affirm him to have taught <hi>Mentel</hi> the art; we ſhall not wonder that <hi>Wimpheling</hi> makes him the firſt inventor of it, ſeeing he practis'd it there ſometime before it was known that <hi>Fauſt</hi> had done the like at <hi>Mentz;</hi> and was conſequently the firſt Printer, that <hi>Wimpheling</hi> might know of: nor is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe that <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> could have been weak enough to ſay any thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0712300300:75"/>
of what had paſs'd at <hi>Mentz</hi> between <hi>Fauſt</hi> and himſelf, it being ſo little to his credit.</p>
                  <p>MENTEL's next authority is taken from the coat of arms given to the family by the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> III; for which there is no other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony but the firſt leaf of the <hi>Onomaſticon.</hi> However ſuppoſing it to be authentick, may we not with the greateſt reaſon oppoſe to it the patent or privilege granted by the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> to <hi>John Schoeffer,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his being the grand-ſon of <hi>John Fauſt</hi> the firſt inventor of the art of Printing? this privilege being of much later date than the other, may be reaſonably enough ſuppos'd a retract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion of the former, which might have been ſurreptitiouſly obtain'd; eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Fauſt</hi> has the concurrent teſtimonies of writers and inconteſtable facts, but <hi>Mentel</hi> only brings an old chronicle and the moſt precarious grounds to ſupport his pretenſions. However the authentickneſs of this grant is not only much queſtion'd by the generality of writers, but has one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial objection againſt it, which is, that the perſon to whom it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, never made any mention or ſhew of it in all the books printed by him at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> which, according to <hi>Wimpheling</hi>'s account, were very numerous. It ſeems to me ſurprizing, that if he had really obtain'd ſuch a noble teſtimony of his being the firſt inventor of Printing, and had been ſo treacherouſly robb'd both of the ſecret and the glory of it by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſervant, he had not made uſe of his Imperial Majeſty's authority (whoſe ſubject he was as well as <hi>Fauſt,)</hi> to confirm the honour of the invention upon himſelf, and the ſhame of the theft upon the other. But on the contrary, there is not one book to be met with, (tho' we may reaſonably think Dr. <hi>Mentel</hi> was not negligent in ſuch a ſearch,) that was printed by <hi>John Mentel</hi> before the year 1473, and even this was without any mention of the place where it was printed; as appears from the <hi>Speculum morale</hi> of <hi>Vincentius</hi> in folio, which is the oldeſt book known to bear his name: whereas <hi>Fauſt</hi> and his ſon-in-law put their names to their impreſſions almoſt ſixteen years before that time, as is plain from the <hi>Pſalmorum Codex</hi> printed <hi>ann.</hi> 1457. What is ſtill more wonderful, is, that <hi>John Mentel</hi> never plac'd this coat of arms in any of his books as we can find; for the oldeſt edition that hath it, is the <hi>Geographical work of Ptolemy</hi> printed by his nieces ſon MDXX, that is, 70 years after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0712300300:76"/>
64 years after the grant, and 63 after <hi>Fauſt</hi> had begun to print in his own name, even by <hi>Mentel</hi>'s own confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>I come now to conſider the epigram, and Dr. <hi>Mentel</hi>'s wild inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from it, (which he grounds upon a ſuppoſition, that the <hi>epiſtles,</hi> at the end of which it is printed, were done at <hi>Strasburgh,)</hi> from which he would conclude, that from this city, not only the three firſt Printers of <hi>Paris,</hi> to whom they are inſcrib'd, but alſo the moſt celebrated ones of <hi>Europe</hi> came.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0712300300:78"/>
the author doth not ſay that the art was invented at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> but that the inventor was a native of the place; in which he was certainly miſtaken, ſeeing <hi>Schoeffer,</hi> who beſt knew the place of his own birth, declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all his inſcriptions a native of <hi>Gernſheim,</hi> a ſmall town upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> a little below <hi>Worms.</hi> Beſides we have no books extant, which are printed before the year 1471 at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> when <hi>John Schuſter</hi> gave an edition of <hi>Paul Oroſius</hi>'s <hi>Chronography</hi> in <hi>folio.</hi> The other town, <hi>viz.

I hope, that by this time enough has been ſaid, to ſatisfy the reader, that all which hath been urg'd in favour of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Strasburgh,</hi> or theſe two laſt cities, is unworthy to come into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with theſe noble teſtimonies and facts we have alleg'd on the ſide of <hi>Mentz.</hi> I ſhall therefore with the greateſt pleaſure diſmiſs this rough and tedious path of controverſy, and reſume the thread of our hiſtory.</p>

This is the foundation of the diſagreement between writers upon the ſubject; which may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0712300300:79"/>
be eaſily reconcil'd by attending to the different epocha's, from which they date the diſcovery. Some of them, as <hi>Wimpheling, Palmerus, Althamerus,</hi> &amp;c. date it from the infancy of the invention of wooden blocks, and aſſign the year 1440. Others, as the author of the chronicle of <hi>Cologn, Trithemius, Aventine,</hi> and many more, from the invention of fuſile types <hi>anno.</hi> 1450. <hi>Andrew Thevet, Angel Rocha,</hi> &amp;c. fix the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the former method in 1442; whilſt others place the time of the ſecond invention in 1453 or 1454, among whom are <hi>Apianus</hi> and <hi>P. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Philip Bergomenſis</hi> and <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> aſſign the year 1458 for the perfection of it. To accommodate this diſcrepancy among all theſe authors, it will be ſufficient to ſay with relation to the firſt, that they take their date from the time in which the invention of wooden blocks was perfected, rather than from its infancy: with reſpect to the laſt, that they thought a ten years interval much too ſhort for the tranſition from the infancy of the former to the perfection of the latter method, and therefore allow'd a few years more than their predeceſſors had done. As for thoſe who fix the latter invention in 1458, they were ſuch as eſteem'd the firſt printed book to have been the <hi>Catholicon</hi> printed <hi>ann.</hi> 1460, or perhaps the ſecond impreſſion of the <hi>bible ann.</hi> 1462, or <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>offices an.</hi> 1466, as <hi>Zwinger</hi> and others ſuppos'd; and allow'd ſome years more for the invention and perfection of the art. Now 'tis plain that before the <hi>Pſalmorum Codex,</hi> as we have hinted, there is not any book known to have been printed with an <hi>imprimatur</hi> at the end; and it is equally certain, that the learned knew nothing of this laſt book 'till the year 1669, in which <hi>Peter Lambeck</hi> publiſh'd the ſecond part of his catalogue of the <hi>imperial library,</hi> where this noble monument is preſerv'd; which is the reaſon that it is omitted in all the liſts of the firſt printed books. 'Tis not ſtrange therefore that theſe writers, for want of dates and facts, ſhould be oblig'd to gueſs, as well as they could, at the time of the diſcovery. However we find that the chronicler of <hi>Cologn, Serrarius, Sebaſt. Munſter,</hi> and others after them, well enough reconcile this diverſity of opinions, by aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the year 1440 for the former invention, and 1450 for the latter. To theſe if we add the authority of <hi>Trithemius,</hi> who certainly had the beſt information in this matter, from <hi>Peter Schoeffer</hi> a principal perſon in the invention, it will be evident, that about the year 1440 they began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0712300300:80"/>
themſelves to cutting or engraving upon wooden blocks, after the <hi>Chineſe</hi> manner, and printed ſome books with them; but that after the year 1450 they found out a more excellent way, for theſe are <hi>Trithemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s words in the famous paſſage quoted in <hi>chap.</hi> 3 <note n="1" place="bottom">Poſt haec inventis ſucceſſerunt ſubtiliora, inveneruntque modum fundendi formas om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Latini alphabeti literarum, &amp;c.</note>, <hi>viz.</hi> of caſting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate metal types: this method they might have been deviſing and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before that time, <hi>i. e.</hi> during ſome part of the firſt ten years; tho' they continued ſtill printing after the old way, 'till they had quite perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the new one; either to bring in a continual ſupply of money ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or perhaps to keep the world from prying into the new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wherein they were engag'd.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid nothing hitherto of the <hi>dutch</hi> writers, who to make the time of this invention agree with <hi>Junius</hi>'s ſtory of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s pretended theft, have put it back, ſome above ten, others twenty years: how little credit they merit in this particular is already ſhewn; and the reader will be ſtill more convinc'd of it, when he ſees what ſhifts they are reduc'd to, for want of authorities to oppoſe to the vaſt number of writers quoted on <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſide, not one of whom ever thought of fixing this remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble epocha beyond the year 1440.</p>
                  <p>THEIR firſt authority is the inſcription ſet over <hi>Laurence Coſter</hi>'s door by one of the citizens of <hi>Harlem,</hi> which is mention'd by all the <hi>dutch</hi> writers, and ſays that he found out this art <hi>ann.</hi> 1430: but this is of too recent a date to be of any weight.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of the firſt books printed by <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THERE has been frequent occaſion of mentioning the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> as the firſt tryal of the art of Printing, according to <hi>Trithemius</hi>'s te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; but as it is our deſign to ſpeak of thoſe only, which are done with ſeparate metal types, and bear ſome certain date or mark of the Printer; I ſhall ſuſpend the account of it, 'till I come to treat of its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond impreſſion by the ſame <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer ann.</hi> 1460.</p>
                  <p>'T is certain that if only that book, which bears the oldeſt date, is to be eſteem'd the firſt printed; the <hi>book of pſalms</hi> ſo often mention'd will bid the faireſt for the firſt rank. Nevertheleſs I can ſee no reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſo far from the teſtimonies of <hi>Trithemius</hi> and the <hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Cologn,</hi> as not to allow the preference to the <hi>Latin Bible,</hi> which, as they tell us, was the firſt book, to which the pious authors of this art thought fit to conſecrate their labours. In this opinion they have been follow'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned and judicious writers both antient and modern; particularly <hi>Malincrot, Chevillier, de la Caille, Paul Pater</hi> and <hi>Watſon.</hi> I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſelect the ſtrongeſt of their reaſons, add a few remarks of my own upon them, and leave the deciſion to the reader.</p>
                  <p>FIRST with reſpect to <hi>Trithemius</hi>'s teſtimony; which, I think, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable, ſeeing he affirms nothing but what he had from <hi>Peter Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effer</hi>'s mouth: He plainly enough intimates, that the <hi>Bible</hi> was their firſt work, when he ſays that the art was found out by degrees: that after they had finiſh'd the diſcovery in ſpeculation, and came to put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, they were involv'd in many difficulties: that <note n="1" place="bottom">A primo inventionis ſuae, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> impreſſari namque b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

                     <hi>ſoon after or from the beginning of this invention, when they went about printing the Bible,</hi> before they had finiſh'd the third quaternion (or quire of four ſheets,) the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amounted already to four thouſand <hi>florins,</hi> a prodigious ſum in thoſe days. If we duly conſider theſe words, we cannot but conclude the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0712300300:83"/>
to have been the firſt book they engaged in. Our author indeed men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not the year in which it was printed; but this might proceed from forgetfulneſs or want of information. However ſince ſuch a work could not be finiſh'd in a ſhort time, when the art was in its infancy, the hands but few and unacquainted with the ſeveral branches of compoſition, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, correction, diſtribution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may ſuppoſe the invention to have been perfected in ſpeculation about the year 1450, and yet to have required ſome time before it could be put in practice, by reaſon of the difficulties ariſing in it; ſo that it will be reaſonable to allow a year or two more, before the impreſſion of the <hi>bible</hi> could be compleated. This may in all probability be the reaſon why <hi>Trithemius,</hi> who is always ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exact in his <hi>chronicles,</hi> and mentions the year of any fact, when he is ſure of it, rather chooſes to make uſe of a more general expreſſion in this caſe, <hi>viz. his temporibus</hi> about this time, when he ſpeaks of the year 1450: if we recollect that he expreſſes himſelf in the ſame words in his firſt <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle,</hi> we ſhall be oblig'd either to allow a larger ſcope to them; or elſe ſuppoſe that the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> which was done in wood, and the <hi>Bible</hi> printed with metal types, were finiſh'd at the ſame time, which would be abſurd.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Manuſcript Cologn Chronicle</hi> tells us, that it was printed in the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> year 1450, in a large character, ſuch as is us'd in the impreſſions of <hi>Miſſals</hi> or <hi>Maſs books,</hi> which anſwers to our <hi>Double Pica.</hi> This <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle</hi> was written in <hi>high dutch ann.</hi> 1499; the author of which acquaints us, that he had the particulars of this invention from <hi>Ulric Zel,</hi> an old bookſeller then living at <hi>Cologn.</hi> As the original is not ſo well underſtood here, I ſhall ſubjoin at the bottom of the page, the whole paſſage in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, as I find it tranſlated by <hi>Malinkrot</hi>

I apprehend but two tolerable objections againſt this; the <hi>firſt</hi> is, that not one of theſe <hi>bibles</hi> is known to be extant: The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that <hi>Fauſt</hi> cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be ſuppos'd to have begun with ſo large and expenſive a volume, when a ſmaller would have been more proper for an eſſay, and brought him a more ſpeedy gain. To the <hi>firſt</hi> I anſwer, 1. That this <hi>bible</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo full of abbreviations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in imitation of the old way of writing, and difficult to be read, might undergo the ſame fate with many other books both MS. and others, to be thrown by and deſtroy'd, when the fairer and more legible impreſſions came in vogue: 2. The learned <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> in his <hi>Oration de Bibliotheca Reipublicae Noribergenſis</hi> tells us, that he had ſeen no leſs than eight copies of them in the <hi>Norican</hi> library, without date, colophon, or any other mark of their being printed by <hi>Fauſt.</hi> As I have not been able to procure <hi>Saubert</hi>'s book, I muſt content my ſelf with giving the reader the paſſage out of <hi>Paul Pater,</hi> in which this is mention'd: it is as follows, <note n="1" place="bottom">

The only intelligence which we had concerning theſe eight, is owing to <hi>Saubert;</hi> neither would theſe gentlemen have believ'd that there had been a <hi>Pſalmorum Codex</hi> printed at <hi>Mentz ann.</hi> 1457, tho' aſſur'd of it by <hi>Trithemius</hi> and <hi>Zel,</hi> had not <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lambeck</hi> the Emperor's library-keeper 28 years ago told us, that he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0712300300:86"/>
met with it in that famous library. I have been likewiſe aſſur'd from the mouth of a gentleman of credit, that a friend of his had ſeen one abroad with the date of 1457, and farther that 'twas his opinion 'twould be brought to <hi>England.</hi> How many authors have had a notion that <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi> was the firſt printed book? yet time has produc'd no leſs than four printed before it, excluſive of the <hi>bible</hi> now in queſtion; and may yet diſcover more concerning this.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the <hi>ſecond</hi> objection ſo much inſiſted upon by ſome; <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis improbable <hi>Fauſt</hi> would begin his firſt eſſays with a volume ſo large and expenſive, when a ſmaller would have anſwer'd his purpoſe much better, and brought an immediate gain. My reply is, 1. That the great expence at firſt conſiſted in purchaſing ſuch a quantity of materials as the buſineſs requir'd, and not in printing of the firſt book, which was inconſiderable compar'd with that; conſequently a ſmaller volume would have been too ſlender a reimburſement for ſuch great ſums expended: Beſides we have ſhewn that they took up money of <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of parchment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and were not ſo ſtraitned as before. 2. As <hi>Fauſt</hi> deſign'd to ſell as many of his firſt printed books as he could for manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, in order to make up the coſt which he had been at; 'tis obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that he muſt pitch upon ſome conſiderable and valuable book, before his art was diſcover'd, and where could he fix upon one more adapted to his purpoſe than this? I will not inſiſt upon the piety of the perſons ſo conſpicuous in all their inſcriptions, (tho' our age may call it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,) which might have a great ſhare in determining their choice. I ſhall only add, that as it was by no means adviſeable for him to ſell any of his firſt eſſays, left they ſhould betray his invention; ſo it was moſt prudent to make them upon the firſt leaves of the Bible, which if they ſucceeded, would in time make him ample amends; and if they did not, the loſs was no greater than if they had been try'd upon a <hi>Donatus</hi> or a <hi>Primer.</hi> Beſides none of our authors have affirm'd that he began to print the <hi>bible</hi> before he had perfected the art both in theory and practice; and made a ſufficient number of maculatures and other tryals, which it was the moſt prudent way to burn as ſoon as printed off. I ſhall leave this diſcourſe of the firſt <hi>bible</hi> to the reader's choice, either to cloſe in with, or diſſent from us in allowing it the firſt rank; and proceed now to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0712300300:87"/>
remainder of our propos'd liſt. It will be neceſſary however to acquaint him, altho' we have given the preference to that ſacred book upon the teſtimonies of ſo many antient and modern writers, tho' it bears no date, yet in the following liſt I am about to give him of theſe firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Fauſt,</hi> we chiefly inquire after ſuch as carry either date or ſome other certain mark of the year in which they were printed: for as to thoſe that do not, I ſhall ſpeak of them afterwards, and ſhew that thoſe authors who thought to have found out their date, have prov'd to have been in an error; which will be a ſufficient reaſon for us not to depend upon any others of the like nature.</p>
                  <p>NEXT to the <hi>Bible</hi> we find <hi>five</hi> ſeveral impreſſions, which have certainly been made between the years 1457 and 1466. The firſt of theſe, which as we hinted, is omitted in all the liſts of the firſt books that have been printed before <hi>Lambeck</hi>'s catalogue of the <hi>Vienna</hi> library, is the <hi>Pſalmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Codex</hi> printed at <hi>Mentz</hi> upon Vellum <hi>anno</hi> 1457; concerning this, what has been ſaid already will ſuffice, the colophon of it is in the <hi>fourth</hi> chapter, p. 29.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> is the <hi>Rationale Divinorum Officiorum,</hi> written by <hi>William Durand,</hi> printed at <hi>Mentz</hi> upon Vellum two Years after the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> viz. <hi>anno</hi> 1459 by <hi>John Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Peter de Gernſheim</hi> or <hi>Schoeffer; Malinkrot,</hi> who knew nothing of the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> reckons it the firſt printed Book next to the <hi>Bible;</hi> and tells us that he purchas'd one of them, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belong'd to a Monaſtery of <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Monks, deſtroy'd by the civil Wars, the inſcription of which is very near the ſame with that of the <hi>Pſalter.</hi> This <hi>Rationale</hi> is likewiſe in the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s Library, where I ſaw it; it is beautifully printed in Folio, upon Vellum, and is a ſingular Beauty as to Preſs-work.</p>
                  <p>THE Suppoſition of <hi>Malinkrot</hi> and others that this was the firſt print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book, was the reaſon that <hi>Father L'Abbé</hi> a learned <hi>Jeſuit</hi> began his Liſt of printed Books from the Years of its date, <hi>viz.</hi> 1459 to 1500. and the author of the Supplement to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Writers makes this remark upon it, That <hi>Anno</hi> 1459, <hi>John Fauſtus</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the art of Printing, firſt printed the Book of <hi>Guill. Durand de Officiis Eccleſiaſticis</hi> in the city of <hi>Mentz.</hi> Theſe authors were certainly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0712300300:88"/>
in the right, ſeeing no book was then known of an older date: but ſince the ſecond part of <hi>Trithemius</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle,</hi> and the ſecond volume of the <hi>Imperial-library</hi> have been publiſh'd, we muſt look ſome years back for the firſt impreſſion, and give that rank to a more noble work.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Third</hi> is the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> a <hi>Latin</hi> vocabulary, printed at <hi>Mentz anno</hi> 1460. the ſecond time; for the firſt impreſſion was done upon wood. This Book is likewiſe in the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s library, where I ſaw it, it is in a large folio, and beautifully printed. We have given the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it in the fourth <hi>chap.</hi> p. 30, in which tho' the printer's name is not expreſs'd, yet it was done by <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer,</hi> both from the ſimilitude of its character, paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with that of their other works, and becauſe there were at that time no other printers either at <hi>Mentz</hi> or any where elſe. This <hi>Catholicon</hi> is a kind of <hi>Grammar,</hi> compil'd by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> a <hi>Dominican Fryar anno</hi> 1286. It is divided into four parts, the laſt of which contains a dictionary of <hi>Latin</hi> words digeſted alphabetically. There have been ſeveral editions of it in <hi>folio,</hi> as <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villier</hi> tells us, who ſaw two of them; one, very old and without date; the other printed at <hi>Paris anno</hi> 1506. by <hi>Jodocus Badius.</hi> Another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it is done at <hi>Lyons</hi> by <hi>Antony Du Ry anno</hi> 1520, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by <hi>Peter Gille. Furetiere</hi> therefore was led into a palpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, when he affirm'd after <hi>Dr. Mentel</hi> and <hi>Father Jacob a Carmelite,</hi> that the firſt printed books known in <hi>Europe</hi> were <hi>Durandus de Ritibus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae</hi> printed <hi>anno</hi> 1461, a bible printed <hi>anno</hi> 1462, <hi>St. Auſtin de Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei,</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices;</hi> ſeeing here are no leſs than four printed books before the oldeſt of them; beſides this book <hi>de Ritibus Eccleſiae</hi> was not written by <hi>William Durand,</hi> but by <hi>John Stephen Durant,</hi> who was firſt preſident of the parliament of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and is therefore a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent book from the <hi>Durand</hi>'s <hi>Rationale</hi> we are now ſpeaking of, and of a much later date.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>fourth</hi> is the ſecond edition of the <hi>Latin Bible</hi> printed <hi>anno</hi> 1462. in <hi>folio</hi> with the following inſcription at the end <note n="1" place="bottom">Preſens hoc opus finitum ac completum &amp; ad euſebiam Dei induſtria in civitate <hi>Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinà</hi> per <hi>Johannem Fuſt</hi> civem &amp; <hi>retrum Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efer de Gernſheim</hi> clericum Dioeceſis ejuſdem eſt conſummatum anno incarnationis Dominicae MCCCCLX.

'Tis urg'd, that he might print a certain number of them without this, and after the diſcovery, reprint the laſt ſheet with this colophon at the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0712300300:90"/>
end: but this is improbable upon two accounts; firſt, he had already printed three books with inſcriptions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> the <hi>Rationale,</hi> and the <hi>Catholicon;</hi> all which import particularly <hi>that they were not done with pen and ink or any writing tool, but by a fine new invented art of caſting Letters, and printing with them.</hi> Now ſince ſome of theſe muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have been known in <hi>France</hi> long before this year; it was impoſſible to have deceiv'd them by any but the firſt impreſſion, unleſs we did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he kept the three former unſold and unſeen; which would be moſt abſurd to imagine. But ſecondly 'tis plain that his deſign in ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them for MSS. was to reimburſe himſelf for the vaſt charges which he had been at in deviſing this invention, preparing all the neceſſary materials, making eſſays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such expences muſt have reduc'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twelve years before this to the neceſſity of a recruit, ſeeing he had perfected the new invention, and began to print with it on or ſoon after the year 1450. as has been fully prov'd; nor can we in any probability ſuppoſe that he ſhould work on for twelve whole years ſucceſſively and print three editions, two of which were very large, without vending them; eſpecially ſince he is reported by moſt authors to have enrich'd himſelf exceedingly by this time, and conſequently wanted no ſuch ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegem? If I could have obtain'd with all my endeavours any certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the year in which he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> it would have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the diſpute. However, if I may be allow'd a conjecture, ſince we find by the unanimous conſent of writers that the art was perfected in the year 1450, and no books printed in his name till <hi>anno</hi> 1457 as yet known: <hi>Fauſt</hi> might moſt probably ſpend theſe ſeven years in Printing, illuminating and ſelling his firſt <hi>Bible;</hi> after which, his new art being diſcover'd, he thought it in vain to keep it ſecret longer; and therefore in his next book gave the world an account of his method, as we find in the <hi>Pſalmorum Codex</hi> and thoſe that follow'd it. What confirms my conjecture is, that <hi>Guttenburgh,</hi> who was proſecuted by <hi>Fauſt</hi> for the moiety of the money expended, and gave a deed bearing date 1455 for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, purſuant to the judge's determination, inſtead of complying with it, eſcap'd to <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> and left his partner in the lurch, this we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, reduc'd <hi>Fauſt</hi> to ſuch ſtreights, as oblig'd him to go to <hi>Paris</hi> with what books he had, in order to ſell them to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0712300300:91"/>
Theſe reaſons induce me to think that it was the <hi>firſt,</hi> and not the <hi>ſecond bible,</hi> which <hi>Fauſt</hi> ſold at ſuch extraordinary rates: The reader is at his liberty to judge as he pleaſes in this matter.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>fifth</hi> is the <hi>Tully's Offices</hi> printed at <hi>Mentz ann.</hi> 1465; tho' ſome editions have a later date by one, and others by two years, all of which are printed at <hi>Mentz,</hi> with the ſame inſcription in every reſpect, as we ſhall ſhew immediately. The Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſhew'd me this book; 'tis a ſmall <hi>4to,</hi> and very beautifully printed, and well preſerv'd. Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi> had this in his library, which he preſented to the univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where it is ſtill kept.

                  <p>AFTER the finiſhing of this book, <hi>Fauſt</hi> is ſuppos'd to have died, or loſt his ſight (as ſome report,) or at leaſt to have grown ſo rich, that he left the buſineſs wholly to his ſon-in-law <hi>Peter Schoeffer,</hi> who then inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his ſon <hi>John</hi> in that art.

in <hi>8vo</hi> at <hi>Jena</hi> 1673, in which he quotes the teſtimony of his father <hi>Godfrey Olearius,</hi> who wrote the hiſtory of <hi>Hall,</hi> printed at <hi>Leipſick</hi> in <hi>4to. ann.</hi> 1667. <hi>Chevillier</hi> obſerves very juſtly, that <hi>Olearius</hi> hath mention'd neither the ſize nor printer of this ancient book; and that all who have ſince ſpoken of it, rely upon his teſtimony: he thinks therefore that it ought to have been more nicely enquired into, ſince if the date be true, it entirely overturns the receiv'd opinion that this art was not perfected 'till the year 1450: the reaſons of his ſuſpecting it is, becauſe <hi>Utinus</hi> liv'd in <hi>Italy ann.</hi> 1445, according to <hi>Poſſevinus,</hi> and can hardly be ſuppos'd to have had ſuch credit in <hi>Germany,</hi> as that his ſermons ſhould be printed after a new method ſcarce known to above <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> perſons: he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of opinion, that the book is a manuſcript, or that <hi>Olearius</hi> has gueſs'd at the date, or which is moſt likely, that this is the date of the compiling, not of the printing of it.</p>

Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> adds, that the characters of it are very rude and ill ſhap'd and ſo full of abbreviations, that they are as difficult to read, as thoſe printed at <hi>Mentz ann.</hi> 1459 and 1460.</p>
                  <p>THIS makes it abundantly plain, that tho' the book carries the above-mention'd date, yet it bears teſtimony that the compiling and not the printing of it, is there intended; ſo that not only the difficulty diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, but <hi>Chevillier's</hi> conjecture is manifeſtly ſupported: And Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire</hi> ſeems entirely of this opinion, and beſides inſtances in a book or two which he hath, whoſe dates as he aſſures us, were thoſe of their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd; tho' the obſcurity of their inſcription, might poſſibly lead an unwary reader to take it for that of its impreſſion: and indeed it is an unreaſonable ſuppoſition, that Printing could have been brought to ſuch a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at that time, againſt the general teſtimony of writers: beſides nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the abbreviations, nor the rudeneſs of the character, can be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent index of their antiquity, ſeeing, as he obſerves, they continued in uſe among ſome eminent Printers even beyond the year 1500. In the next place I ſhall mention ſome editions, whoſe dates are certainly prov'd to be wrong. The firſt is the <hi>Regula Paſtoris</hi> of Pope <hi>Gregory;</hi> a copy of which is in the <hi>French</hi> king's library, with this inſcription ſuppos'd to be written at the end; <hi>Tentamentum Fauſti,</hi> an eſſay of <hi>John Fauſt ann.</hi> 1459: now it is plain from what has been ſaid before that <hi>Fauſt</hi> was ſo far from making any eſſays at that time, that he had already printed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perfect editions, Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> gives us this account of it <hi>p.</hi> 22. that he met with a book in <hi>4to</hi> in the king's library at <hi>Paris,</hi> without the name of either place or Printer, only with this title, <hi>Liber Regulae paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis</hi> Gregorii <hi>papae ad</hi> Johannem <hi>epiſcopum</hi> Ravenenſem: at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which <hi>Gabriel Naudé</hi> had written two verſes to the reader with his own hand, intimating that book to have been certainly printed by <hi>Fauſt</hi> at <hi>Mentz,</hi> becauſe the mark of the paper which is the head and horns of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0712300300:95"/>
an heifer, is an infallible criterium of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s books. And an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he confirms his aſſertion, from the rudeneſs of the types, the want of diphthongs, and ſome other circumſtances that favour the infancy of the art; and concludes, that <hi>Fauſt</hi> would not put his name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to it, 'till his frequent eſſays had embolden'd him to make himſelf publick, as he did afterwards in the <hi>Durand</hi>'s <hi>Rationale</hi> of 1459, <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Mattaire</hi> doth indeed prove plainly enough, that the rudeneſs of the types, and want of dates, names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> continued ſome conſiderable time after the diſcovery of the art, and conſequently that that could be no certain mark of its being one of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s firſt eſſays: however as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain can be affirm'd concerning this book, we ſhall dwell no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon it. I have ſeen <hi>Aeneas Sylvius's</hi> letters printed by <hi>Koelhoff</hi> of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> which is certainly antedated, for this reaſon, ſeveral dates in the letters being ten years older than the date of the book itſelf. There is another of his books in <hi>fol.</hi> in the library of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> with a falſe date at the end of theſe words, <hi>Flores de diverſis ſermonibus &amp; epiſtolis</hi> B. Bernardi <hi>per me</hi> Joan. Koelhoff <hi>de</hi> Lubeck <hi>colonienſem civem impreſſi an.</hi> MCCCC, <hi>feliciter finiunt:</hi> for 'tis plain the art was not ſo much as thought of at that time, nor perfected 'till 50 years after: but what demonſtrates the falſeneſs of the date is, that this <hi>John Koelhoff</hi> was ſcarce born then, ſince he printed the works of <hi>N. Gerſon</hi> in 4 <hi>vol.</hi> in <hi>fol.</hi> at <hi>Cologn ann.</hi> 1483, which are of the ſame make and character as the <hi>Flores</hi> abovemention'd, as <hi>Chevillier p.</hi> 10 and 11 obſerves, who therefore thinks that the following numbers LXXXII were omitted at the end of MCCCC. The ſame author mentions two or three editions more of the ſame nature, the laſt of which is the <hi>Manipulus Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorum</hi> of <hi>Guy Mout Rocher</hi> with the following uncommon date at the end <note n="1" place="bottom">Completus <hi>Pariſiis</hi> anno Domini milleſimo CCCC viceſimo tertio, amen. <hi>Chevil.</hi> p. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Printed at</hi> Paris <hi>in the year one thouſand</hi> CCCC <hi>and twenty three, amen:</hi> 'tis plain that the art was not brought to <hi>Paris</hi> 'till the year 1470, as ſhall be ſhown in its place; ſo that the laſt C muſt have been taken up by the balls, or loſt ſome other way. Upon the whole it may be eſteem'd a general rule that all dates before the year 1450 are falſe; and this is corroborated with the ſuffrage of all learned writers upon this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0712300300:96"/>
ſubject. In the mean time as it is not reaſonable to imagine, that <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer</hi> could be altogether idle from the year 1452, in which they are ſuppos'd to have finiſh'd their firſt <hi>Bible,</hi> to 1457, in which they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> (unleſs we can ſuppoſe that <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s law-ſuit with <hi>Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> and his journey and ſtay in <hi>France,</hi> could take him up <hi>five</hi> whole years, and that his ingenious ſon did not venture upon any work by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;) if time and induſtry ſhould, as we may reaſonably hope it may, diſcover any more of thoſe old and valuable monuments of the infancy of the art; provided ſuch impreſſions bear either a certain date or mark of their being done at <hi>Mentz,</hi> and by our <hi>Protodaedali</hi> before the diſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſervants, or even after that time; I doubt not but the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will allow them a proper rank in the liſts, which ſhall be publiſh'd hereafter.</p>

                  <p>THO' I propos'd to avoid all unneceſſary repetitions, yet this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being deſign'd as a ſhort recapitulation of the hiſtory of the firſt <hi>twelve</hi> years, the thread of which has been unavoidably interrupted by controverſy; and to introduce ſome material occurrences, which could not properly be inſerted in any other chapter, or ſuch as may have eſcap'd the readers memory; I find the impoſſibility of joyning theſe notable events together, without interſperſing them with moſt of thoſe already touched upon: and this has render'd an apology before hand highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the year 1450, in which 'tis agreed by moſt authors, that the art was perfected in theory and practice, the inventors having prepar'd their tools and materials, and made a great number of eſſays; thinking they might with ſafety attempt ſome conſiderable volume: Their next care was to carry on the buſineſs without danger of being diſcover'd: to this end they admitted as few ſervants as poſſible into any part of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0712300300:97"/>
and ſuch only upon whoſe ſidelity they might depend, engaging them to the greateſt ſecrecy by an oath. This being done they allotted to them their ſeveral provinces; but conceal'd every branch of Letter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding and compoſing. If my authority be required, ſince all our accounts relating to theſe beginnings are ſo obſcure and imperfect; I anſwer, that this may reaſonably be infer'd from a remarkable paſſage out of the learned <hi>Hen. Pantaleon,</hi> a phyſician of <hi>Baſil,</hi> part of which I have already quoted in a former chapter, as far as it related to <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer</hi>'s being the authors of this art; the remainder of it is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <note n="1" place="bottom">Erat enim ars illa primo abſcondita &amp; pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis manifeſtata; litteras enim in ſacculis clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis ſecum in Officinae ferebant, ac dum abeunt, auferebant; donec temporis ſucceſſu ars aucta atque plurimum illuſtrata fuit. <hi>Do illuſtribus German.</hi> part. 2. pag. 397.</note>: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"This art was at the firſt kept very ſecret and communicated to but very few; for they <hi>(Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer)</hi> tyed up the types in bags, which they brought into the work-room, and took away when they went out, 'till at length in proceſs of time the buſineſs increaſing caus'd the Art to be divulg'd."</q> All the authors quoted by us agree with <hi>Pantaleon</hi> about their keeping the Art with all imaginable ſecrecy, but ſcarce any have inform'd us of this circumſtance, of their carrying their types with them to and out of the work-room; which would have been a vain precaution, had they intruſted any but themſelves in the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's part. However it is evident that the whole ſecret did not conſiſt therein; the cutting the Punches, ſinking them into the Matrices, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Moulds and caſting the Letters, might be ſtill a ſecret to any one that had been intruſted ſo far as to go through all the branches of the buſineſs of Printing; and he muſt have been a perſon of a ſurprizing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius who could have found out the myſtery of Letter-founding by bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing the letters, therefore the keeping that part to themſelves was making it a greater ſecret than all the oaths they could bind them with.</p>
                  <p>THE next remarkable occurrence is that of their admitting <hi>John Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbergh</hi> a wealthy goldſmith into partnerſhip with them, as it is related by the laſt nam'd author, by <hi>Salmuth,</hi> and others quoted in the <hi>third</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This gentleman finding his neighbour <hi>Fauſt</hi> engag'd in a new and advantagious invention, which he wanted money to carry on, and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0712300300:98"/>
by a proſpect of gain, offer'd his purſe and aſſiſtance upon good terms to <hi>Fauſt;</hi> who gladly accepted the propoſal. But <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his own private rather than the common intereſt, and having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ſome inſight into the art, began to object that <hi>Fauſt</hi> had conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of the money to his own uſes, and refus'd the payment of his dividend of the charges; 'till <hi>Fauſt</hi> had obtain'd a decree, which oblig'd him to pay his moiety of what the plaintiff ſhould ſwear had been expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the common fund: this he evaded by giving a bond payable ſome time after, and eſcaping to <hi>Strasburgh</hi> his native city, before it was due. But he firſt took care to learn as much of the art, as he could, to furniſh himſelf with Printing-tools, and to draw off ſome of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with him. At <hi>Strasburgh</hi> he communicated to <hi>John Mentel</hi> or <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telin</hi> the ſecret, and his deſign of ſetting up a Printing-houſe there: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever neither he nor his workmen were ſo throughly inſtructed in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, but they were oblig'd to demur a conſiderable time before they could perfect every thing for the work, and to make many tryals in order to attain the right method; which is evident from this, that there is no book extant with <hi>Mentel</hi>'s name 'till the year 1473, and not at all with <hi>Guttenbergh</hi>'s; for it is ſcarce probable, that if they had printed any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable volumes before that time, they ſhould all have periſh'd without being ſo much as taken notice of by any author, and eſpecially by their learned townſman <hi>Wimpheling:</hi> whilſt there remain ſo many of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s in the writings and in the hands of the learned and curious.

It is not indeed to be ſuppos'd, that they were all equal in the ornamental part; yet the beauty of the work,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0712300300:99"/>
the elegancy of the flower-pieces, initial letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the variety of the fineſt colours intermix'd with gold and ſilver, with which they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely variegated, made the purchaſers fond of ſhewing them to their acquaintance; as every one thought the whole world could not produce ſuch another. 'Tis reported that the Archbiſhop thinking his <hi>bible</hi> worth his majeſty's ſeeing, carried it to him; who view'd it with ſurprize, and in return ſhew'd his own: upon a ſtricter examination and comparing 'em together, they found that the ornaments were not exactly the ſame; but as to the other part ſuppos'd to be written, they obſerv'd ſuch a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the number of pages, lines, words, and even the letters, as ſoon convinc'd them that they were done by ſome other method than tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing: beſides two ſuch <hi>bibles</hi> were the work of a man's life-time to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; and upon enquiry he was found to have ſold a much greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

                  </p>
                  <p>HOWEVER, the parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> thought fit to make an arreſt in favour of him, and to diſcharge him from all further proſecution, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his noble invention; and as I am credibly inform'd, a ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was paid by that crown to <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s deſcendants for many years after, as a reward for his ſufferings and merit: this was the end and ſucceſs of that

Some of theſe having attain'd a ſufficient inſight into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, were induc'd to go ſomewhere elſe, and ſet up for themſelves; to which they were encourag'd, both by the example of thoſe who went away with <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> and probably by invitations from other places, which were deſirous of having the Art brought to them. <hi>Pantaleon</hi> tells us, that ſome of thoſe who ſignaliz'd themſelves the firſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> were of that number; and indeed if we conſider how ſoon they began to print in that kingdom, eſpecially <hi>Rome, Venice, &amp;c.</hi> and make a juſt allowance for preparing the great apparatus of a Printing-houſe, with their firſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays, before they came to work off thoſe volumes, which are of the oldeſt date, ſome of them pretty large; we cannot but think that they left <hi>Mentz</hi> long before it was taken. <hi>Fauſt</hi> however had a ſufficient number of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants left to finiſh his laſt editions, which are mention'd before; after this we hear no more of him 'till the year 1471, wherein <hi>Peter Schoeffer</hi> and one <hi>Henlif</hi> a bookſeller gave a book to a monaſtery, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the prayers of it for <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſoul: by which it was apparent he was dead before that time, or perhaps before 1470, becauſe <hi>Schoeffer</hi> in that year printed St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles</hi> in his own name, without any mention of his maſter <hi>Fauſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0712300300:101"/>
HERE therefore I am oblig'd to conclude the hiſtory of that <hi>illuſtrious man,</hi> tho' I ſhould have been vaſtly more ſatisfy'd in communicating other particulars of his life and death, could I have found 'em in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe times. But <hi>Germany</hi> is not the only ungrateful country that has neglected ſuch as have beſt deſerv'd of her; for the following books will furniſh us with inſtances of this in other parts of the world. I ſhall only obſerve, that as it is the property of falſe deſert to be ſolicitous for panegyricks and monumental records, whilſt true and intrinſick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſilent, and equally contemns both; ſo whilſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> beſtow the higheſt encomiums upon a <hi>ſuppoſitious and imaginary inventor:</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> have been ſo regardleſs of a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> one, as to leave it entirely to his own works to tranſmit his praiſes to poſterity. If <hi>Fauſt</hi> had died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſacking of <hi>Mentz,</hi> we might have had grounds to ſuppoſe, that ſome monument had been erected to his memory by his fellow-citizens, and deſtroy'd by the conqueror; but as he ſurviv'd thoſe times at leaſt <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>ſeven</hi> years, and carry'd on and improv'd the Art during that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, 'tis impoſſible to entertain ſo favourable an opinion of the <hi>Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> However his books and the art which he left us, will more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and univerſally proclaim and perpetuate his name and memory, than any monumental inſcriptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and endear both to the learned and curious, as long as the Art or the world itſelf ſhall endure.</p>
                  <p>THERE is one occurrence worthy to be mention'd, which I omitted in this chapter, not ſo much out of forgetfulneſs or neglect, ſince it is an inſtance of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s gratitude and generoſity, as becauſe it is not eaſy to fix the time of it, nor ſo likely to have happen'd within the compaſs of theſe <hi>ten</hi> years, as of ſome of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> between 1440 and 1450. That is, his giving his only daughter in marriage to his ſervant <hi>Peter Schoeffer,</hi> admitting him into partnerſhip, and procuring him the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> as a reward for his ſervices, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he made to the Art; ſuch as the invention of punches, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices, metal-types; and, as ſome report, Printer's ink: if theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are owing to him, <hi>Fauſt</hi> made him as ample amends as he could poſſibly. I wiſh <hi>Schoeffer</hi> had been ſo grateful to his generous maſter, as to have tranſmitted to us a fuller account of his life and character, than what we enjoy; or if he perform'd this, that time had not depriv'd us
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0712300300:102"/>
of ſo valuable a monument; the want of which obliges me, much againſt my will, to bring this chapter and hiſtory to a concluſion, and reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with what we have.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. The Concluſion with an Account of the antient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>Printing.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I AM now come to the cloſe of the firſt book of this hiſtory, which I have endeavour'd to inrich with collections from dead and living authors, and every thing valuable that I could procure upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, from many of the moſt curious libraries. The next book will open a large and pleaſant ſcene. In the mean time I cannot conclude this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than by giving a ſhort ſummary of the whole, and digeſting it into diſtinct periods, that the reader may, as it were at one view, ſee the whole progreſs of the Art, and fix it more eaſily in his memory; and by cloſing it with an account of the old way of printing us'd during the time of <hi>Fauſt,</hi> his ſon-in-law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. THIS Art was devis'd a conſiderable time before any thing done that way appear'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'TIS not improbable that the firſt hints of engraving upon wooden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks might come from the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who practis'd it above 300 years before it was thought of in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. THE attempts to imitate it began about the year 1440, and not before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. THE new and more perfect method of Printing with fuſile-types did not ſucceed it 'till 10 years after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1450.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0712300300:103"/>
5. THIS new invention was diſcover'd by <hi>John Fauſt</hi> in the city of <hi>Mentz;</hi> in the perfecting of which <hi>Peter Schoeffer</hi> aſſiſted him very much, and was amply rewarded by his maſter.</p>
                  <p>JOHN GUTTENBERGH had no other ſhare or merit in this diſcovery, than by promoting it with ſupplies of money from time to time, and that not from a principle of a publick ſpirit, but for his own intereſt, which made him drop both the Art and Artiſt when he found it leſs gainful than he expected.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. THIS invention was kept with all imaginable ſecrecy by theſe three parties, 'till <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> upon a difference between them, took ſome of their ſervants with him to <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> where he began to practiſe it, and to teach it to <hi>John Mentel:</hi> The perſon in whoſe favour the <hi>Strasburgh</hi> pretenſions were afterwards ſtarted.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. THIS contention not happening 'till the year 1455, they had already printed the <hi>latin bible,</hi> and perhaps privately diſpos'd of ſome number of the copies, ſeeing their diſpute was about ſtating their accounts, and balancing the charges and profits of the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. WHETHER their firſt ſeparate types were of wood, or lead, or any other metal; they ventur'd to print their firſt eſſays but on one ſide of the page, 'till they had found out a better ink than the common ſort which they then us'd.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. IT is probable from this circumſtance, that their firſt improvement upon common ink, to prevent its ſpreading, was only by charging it with a proportionable quantity of ſome watery gum; ſuch as gum ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, maſtick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which tho' it remedied that defect, would not ſuffer the paper to be printed but upon one ſide: but either <hi>Schoeffer</hi> or his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter having found out the way of making it with oyl, they then printed on both ſides.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. THEY did not begin to put their names and inſcriptions at the end of their books, as we can yet find, 'till the year 1457: this they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to do 'till <hi>Fauſt</hi> either dyed or left off the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0712300300:104"/>
11. GUTTENBERGH's name was never joyn'd with theirs, nor put to of the books which he printed after he abandon'd <hi>Fauſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. SOME others of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſervants forſook him before the taking of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and ſettled ſome at <hi>Cologn,</hi> others in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. THE greateſt diſperſion of them was, when that noble city was taken and plunder'd by Archbiſhop <hi>Adolph, ann.</hi> 1462; ſo that the Art became univerſally known throughout <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE remains now only to give the reader an idea of the firſt way of Printing, and of what is moſt peculiar to it; which, tho' a ſubject well known by the curious, may not be unacceptable to ſeveral perſons, to whoſe hands this work may chance to fall.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. WITH reſpect to their forms, they were generally either large or ſmall <hi>folio's,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>quarto's:</hi> the leſſer ſizes were not in uſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THE leaves were without running-title, direction-word, number of pages, or diviſions into paragraphs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. THE character itſelf was a rude old <hi>Gothic</hi> mix'd with <hi>Secretary,</hi> caſt on purpoſe to imitate the hand-writing of thoſe times; the words were printed ſo cloſe to one another, that it was difficult and tedious even to thoſe who were us'd to MSS. and to this method; and often lead the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive reader into miſtakes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. THEIR orthography was various and often arbitrary; and as for the diphthongs ae and oe, they were not at all careful about them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. THEY had very frequent abbreviations, which in time grew ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and difficult to be underſtood, that there was a neceſſity of writing a book to teach the manner of reading them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. THEIR periods were diſtinguiſh'd by no other points than the double and ſingle one, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>colon</hi> and <hi>full ſtop;</hi> juſt after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0712300300:105"/>
as the reading <hi>pſalms,</hi> in our <hi>Common prayer-books</hi> are pointed; all other punctuations being of much later invention.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. THEY us'd no great letters to begin a ſentence or proper name of men or places.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. THEY left blanks for the places of titles, initial letters, and other ornaments, in order to have them ſupply'd by the illuminators, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious art, tho' in vogue before and at that time, yet did not long ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the maſterly improvements made by the printers in this branch of their Art. Thoſe ornaments were exquiſitely fine, and curiouſly variega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the moſt beautiful colours, and even with gold and ſilver; the margins likewiſe were frequently charged with variety of figures of ſaints, birds, beaſts, monſters, flowers &amp;c. which had ſometimes relation to the contents of the page, tho' moſtly none at all: theſe embelliſhments were very coſtly; but for thoſe that could not afford a round price, there were others done after a more ordinary manner and at much cheaper rates.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. THE names of the printer, place, &amp;c. were either wholly neglected or put at the end of the book, not without ſome pious ejaculation or doxology.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. THE date was likewiſe omitted or involv'd in ſome crampt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial period, or elſe printed either at full length, or by numerical letters, and ſometimes partly one and partly the other, thus; <hi>one thouſand</hi> CCCC and <hi>ſixty,</hi> &amp;c. but all of them at the end of the book.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. THERE was no variety of characters, no intermixture of <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Italick;</hi> which were of later invention; but their pages were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a <hi>Gothick</hi> letter of the ſame ſize throughout.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. THEIR <hi>Rubricks</hi> which were very frequent and added no ſmall beauty to the pages, were ſometimes done by the ſame hands as the initial letters.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0712300300:106"/>
13. WHENEVER they met with any <hi>Greek,</hi> they either left a blank for it, to be afterwards fill'd up by writing if the paſſage was long; or if ſhort, conſiſting only of three or four words, they got it cut on wood, tho' after ſuch a rude and ill-ſhap'd manner, that it required ſome pauſe to be read.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. THE quotations of the places out of which they were taken, were very often neglected both in Manuſcripts and printed books, which caus'd the curious no ſmall trouble to find them out.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. THEY had ſeldom dedicatory or prefatory epiſtles; and when they began afterwards to retail them in their impreſſions, they generally plac'd 'em at the end of the work; a piece of juſtice as much neglected, as want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our age.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. THEY collected no <hi>table</hi> of <hi>contents,</hi> no <hi>index</hi> nor <hi>ſummary,</hi> (which are indubitably a great help to the reader,) nor any <hi>errata's</hi> at the end; for what faults were in their editions were rather owing to the manuſcripts which they printed after, than to the careleſneſs of the Printer.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. THEY printed but few copies at once, for 200 or 300 were then eſteem'd a large impreſſion; tho' upon the encouragements receiv'd from the learned, they increas'd their numbers in proportion.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. LASTLY, If I may be allow'd this article, they were not ſolicitous to obtain <hi>privileges</hi> and <hi>patents</hi> for the ſole printing of any particular volume, tho' towards the later end of <hi>Fauſt's</hi> time ſeveral of his ſervants ſet up Printing-houſes, and were ambitious to excel their maſter: How ſoon after thoſe privileges began, appears from that granted by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to <hi>John Schoeffer, Fauſt's</hi> grandſon <hi>ann.</hi> 1519, for the ſole printing <hi>T. Livius,</hi> and to prohibit any other to reprint thoſe books which had come from his preſs: and as this had been granted upon the account of his being the grandſon of the firſt inventor of the Art; ſo ſeveral Popes and Princes gave like patents to their firſt Printers as a mark of their favour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0712300300:107"/>
I ſhall here mention ſomething concerning their way of Book-binding, an account of which we find in <hi>Scaliger</hi> 
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Scaligeriana, Hag. edit. in 8vo.</hi> p. 173.</note>, who tells us, that his grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a printed Pſalter, the cover of which was two inches thick; in the inſide was a kind of cupboard, wherein was a ſmall ſilver crucifix, and behind it the name of <hi>Berenica Codronia de la Scala.</hi> This book ſeems to have been printed with wood, but probably bound like the reſt.</p>
                  <p>AS to the prices of their books, I cannot find any thing particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what I have before quoted out of <hi>Campanus's</hi> dedication to the Pope; from which it may be infer'd, that in his time at <hi>Rome</hi> they were ſold for about one fifth part of what the MSS. had done. To this I ſhall add an inſtance of the gift bequeath'd by <hi>P. Schoeffer,</hi> and <hi>Conrad Henlif</hi> of the ſame profeſſion, to a library of monks, which will enable us to gueſs at the great rate they ſtill were ſold for. <hi>La Caille</hi> relates it out of the annals of the abby of St. <hi>Victor</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and it is as follows <note n="2" place="bottom">Anniverſarium honorabilium virorum <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri Schoeffer</hi> &amp; <hi>Conr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and ſignified only books publiſh'd and diſpers'd abroad in ſome conſiderable number, in oppoſition to thoſe that were writ fair to be ſet up in libraries, which were call'd <hi>Libri ſcripti.</hi> This obſervation he proves from a paſſage out of <hi>Philelphus,</hi> who ſpeaking of his ten books of <hi>latin odes,</hi> expreſſes himſelf as follows; <hi>Carminum libri editi quinque, verſuum quinque millibus; nam alteri quinque qui tantundem verſus complectentur, partim ſcripti ſunt non editi, partim ne ſcripti quidem,</hi> i. e. <hi>five books of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin odes are already publiſh'd, containing</hi> 5000 <hi>verſes; the other five, which will contain the ſame number, are partly written not publiſh'd, and partly ſtill unwritten:</hi> he obſerves further, that the firſt <hi>five</hi> books of odes were not ſent to the preſs 'till the year 1497, when they were printed in <hi>4to.</hi> at <hi>Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia:</hi> beſides the ſame <hi>Philelphus</hi> tells his reader in one of his epiſtles writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>ann.</hi> 1453, that he deſign'd to publiſh all the ten books in that year, <hi>Libros decem hoc anno edere inſtitui,</hi> which could not be underſtood of Printing, ſeeing tho' the art was perfected about this time, yet it was ſtill kept ſecret 'till <hi>four</hi> years after, when <hi>Fauſt</hi> put his firſt colophon to the Pſalter.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0712300300:109"/>
1450 and 1500, and even beyond; whereas others, for inſtance, that of <hi>Nurembergh</hi> has produc'd at leaſt 13 in that time: I ſhall place them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the years in which they were printed, and add ſuch farther par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars concerning them, as I have been able to meet with in thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have given us an account of them; and ſuch as my own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations have enabled me to collect from thoſe noble libraries I have formerly mention'd.</p>
                  <p>BY this the reader will be ſufficiently appris'd, that I intend to ſpeak only of thoſe which bear any certain date; but as for thoſe, which are either printed without date, or with a diſputed one, I ſhall juſt ſay ſo much of them, as will let him ſee how little they are to be rely'd on, and what reaſons I have to paſs them by: I have, I think, already ventur'd to give the reader a rule how to judge of ſuch works, <hi>viz.</hi> if their dates are before the year 1450, they muſt be ſuppos'd to have been wrong prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either deſignedly, or by miſtake: the reader will find proofs ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the former in our next book, and the later is too well known to require any: however in this later reſpect I ſhall give him an inſtance or two of it, becauſe it will be a kind of a key to rectify any other that may hereafter fall in his way.</p>
                  <p>WE meet with an account of a <hi>German</hi> Bible, ſtill kept in the library of the city of <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> affirm'd by <hi>Hottinger,</hi> who ſaw it there, to have been printed with fuſile types <hi>ann.</hi> 1448, but with this caveat however, <hi>ni fallor, if I am not miſtaken,</hi> as writing at ſome diſtance of time and place: other authors have given it that of 1449, but as either of them preceded the time of the invention, <hi>Malinkrot</hi> tells us, that <hi>Martin Zeiler</hi> thought it 'twas only a manuſcript verſion made <hi>ann.</hi> 1449: but Mr. <hi>Beug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> doth not ſcruple to tell us in the preliminary diſcourſe to his <hi>Incunabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Typographiae,</hi> that they only miſplac'd the two laſt figures of the date, and printed 1449 inſtead of 1494. <hi>Chevillier</hi> mentions two more out of <hi>Lipenius,</hi> whoſe dates are demonſtrably falſe, the one is a Bible printed at <hi>Paris ann.</hi> 1443, and the other at <hi>Lyons ann.</hi> 1446: whereas it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Printing was not brought to <hi>Paris</hi> 'till <hi>twenty ſeven</hi> years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the date of the firſt, <hi>viz. ann.</hi> 1470, nor to <hi>Lyons</hi> 'till <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>ſeven</hi> years after that: the ſame may be ſaid of another printed at <hi>Baſil,</hi> and affirm'd, by two bookſellers of <hi>Geneva</hi> in the catalogue of their books, to bear date
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0712300300:110"/>
1459, ſince 'tis plain that that city did not receive the Art 'till about 1475: if the reader therefore will take this rule with him, to examine the time in which the Art was brought to any place, which he will find in the following Book, he will eaſily rectify any wrong date that may come in his way, and as for thoſe, which do not mention the place or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's name, he may ſafely rank them amongſt the apocryphal ones, and them which have no date at all, but as the former have been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by all our annaliſts, I ſhall be obliged ſo far as I am able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their reſpective dates, as we go along.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. BEFORE I come to ſpeak of thoſe, which bear a certain and indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble date, I muſt not omit the <hi>firſt</hi> printed by <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer</hi> about 1450 or ſoon after, and mention'd by <hi>Trithemius,</hi> the <hi>Colognian Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> and ſome other authors, as the firſt conſiderable work printed with fuſile types by thoſe two <hi>Protodaedali.</hi> I have already given the reaſons of its being printed without date or colophon, which would have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſcovery of their new Art, and prevented <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſelling it for MS: but this however ought by no means to hinder us from giving it the firſt rank, ſeeing the fact is ſo undeniably atteſted. It is pity they have been long ago, either deſtroy'd, or buried in ſome private libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where the moſt diligent ſearches have not as yet been able to find them out: perhaps its being printed ſo like MS, may be one reaſon why they are ſtill lookt upon as ſuch by the owners, if any ſuch there be; for which reaſon I am ſtill willing to hope, that time may diſcover and bring ſome of them to light, and that what has been ſaid in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and by authors of a much higher character, will ſpur up ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons to make a more diligent ſearch after ſo valuable a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'till when, no farther account can be expected of it than what we have already given.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THE next is that, which I have ventur'd, after other authors, to call the ſecond impreſſion of the Bible, printed at <hi>Mentz</hi> by the ſame worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors <hi>ann.</hi> 1462, and which is conſequently the moſt antient we know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in any library; we have already given ſome account of it in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter <hi>p.</hi> 31, and of the colophon printed at the end of it, which we need not therefore repeat here: as there are ſeveral copies of it here in <hi>London</hi> where I have ſeen them, and elſewhere in <hi>England,</hi> we need not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0712300300:111"/>
go to any foreign authors for an account of it: it is printed in <hi>fol.</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all their other works were. For tho' I have follow'd <hi>Peter Lambeck</hi>'s notion of the Pſalters being printed in <hi>4to,</hi> becauſe its ſize may be very much like that of a <hi>quarto,</hi> yet if I may here venture to give my judgment of a book I have not ſeen, I think I have ſufficient grounds to believe that the firſt Printers had their paper made of all ſizes; and that the <hi>five books</hi> printed on Blocks of Wood, already mention'd to be in the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s library, would appear to any one like <hi>quarto's,</hi> were it not that the ſignatures ſhew the contrary.</p>
                  <p>THE next impreſſion we meet with, is one which Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> gives us upon the authority of a learned friend of his, who deſires to have his name conceal'd, and the want of whoſe date is ſupply'd by a colophon of three <hi>latin</hi> verſes importing, that it was printed in the <hi>third</hi> year of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. reign, <hi>i. e. ann.</hi> 1464 by the three <hi>German</hi> partners, who brought the Art to <hi>Paris,</hi> tho' there be no mention made of the place where it was printed, vid. <hi>Annal. Typogr.</hi> p. 41, and 60. I am perſuaded that Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire's</hi> friend was miſtaken in the firſt verſe, and I ſhould not have given it a rank here, nor even mention'd it, were it not to prevent the reader's being puzzled with this account of it under the year 1464; or his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing me guilty of an omiſſion: but as <hi>Chevillier</hi> gives us the ſame colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon printed at the end of the firſt <hi>Paris</hi> Bible by the ſame three part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with this variation however from the former; that in the firſt verſe, inſtead of <hi>Semi luſtrum,</hi> it has <hi>tribus luſtris,</hi> that is inſtead of the <hi>third,</hi> it imports the <hi>thirteenth</hi> year of that king's reign: we may eaſily ſuppoſe, that it was the firſt <hi>Paris</hi> Bible of 1475, and that this unknown gentleman might poſſibly be miſtaken: however the book being in <hi>Queen's-college</hi> library, in <hi>Cambridge</hi> it may be eaſily conſulted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The next impreſſion therefore to that of <hi>Mentz</hi> 1462, is that of <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> [in latin <hi>Auguſta Vindelicorum]</hi> printed by <hi>John Bemler ann.</hi> 1466 in latin <hi>fol.</hi> It is mention'd by <hi>Martin Cruſius, Melchior Adamus,</hi> and after them by <hi>Malinkrot; Chevillier</hi> ſeems indeed to think their teſtimony in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to aſcertain ſo old a date, but I cannot ſee any reaſon for it, ſeeing it is four years more recent than the taking of the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and the diſperſion of <hi>Fauſt's</hi> ſervants; beſides the city of <hi>Ausburgh</hi> was ſo near <hi>Mentz,</hi> and ſo conſiderable withal, that it is no way improbable,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0712300300:112"/>
but ſome one of them might go and ſettle there even ſooner than the year 1466.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>latin</hi> Bible <hi>fol.</hi> printed at <hi>Reutlingen [Reutlingae]</hi> a ſmall town in <hi>Germany</hi> in the dutchy of <hi>Wirtembergh ann.</hi> 1469, mention'd by <hi>Hallevor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> Father <hi>le Long, De la Caille, Chevillier</hi> and others; but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by <hi>John Saubert</hi> in his catalogue of the <hi>Norican</hi> or <hi>Nurembergh</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, where he ſaw it: the Printer of it was <hi>John de Averbach,</hi> we have nothing elſe extant of him at leaſt with his name.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p>I have purpoſedly omitted ſome leſs conſiderable ones, which are either without Printer or places name, or both; becauſe ſuch were only the wretched performances of a few, who made it their buſineſs to reprint the editions of ſome of the moſt famous Printers of <hi>Europe,</hi> whether of the Bible, or of any other conſiderable work; and to vend them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand for the right ones: this was an abuſe which began very early to be complain'd of; for no ſooner had a <hi>Froben, Badius, Aldus</hi> or any other
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0712300300:118"/>
great Printer publiſh'd a work, which had coſt him infinite pains to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, as well as great ſums of money to purchaſe the beſt manuſcripts, but they pyrated them in ſuch a ſhameful and incorrect manner, that they could afford to ſell them for leſs than half the price. And as there wanted not ſordid perſons to encourage this vile practice, and to prefer thoſe maim'd performances to the more correct ones, if they could but ſave money by them; it often prov'd that the ſale of a valuable edition was hinder'd, to the great loſs and diſcouragement of the Printer, whilſt the bad ones went off with eaſe: this occaſion'd them to complain of the abuſe, in their prefaces to their works, and to appeal to the learned againſt ſuch practices; ſome of whom (in particular <hi>Eraſmus)</hi> did not fail to write very ſharply againſt thoſe enemies to learning, who were at length come up to ſuch a degree of impudence, as to counterfeit the names, marks and rebus's of the famous Printers, of which we ſhall have occaſion to give an account hereafter. In the mean time, all their complaints and efforts proving ineffectual towards the ſuppreſſing ſuch pyracies; they were forc'd to have recourſe to the higher powers, and to employ the aſſiſtance of their learned patrons, to obtain them patents and privileges for the ſole printing of thoſe works, upon which they had beſtow'd ſo much pains and coſt: but this more properly belongs to the next book to which I am now haſtening.</p>

                  <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>HITHERTO we have ſeen the <hi>Art of Printing</hi> kept with the utmoſt ſecrecy by its inventors, and confin'd to the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> till the fatal year of its being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken plunder'd and depriv'd of all its former rights and franchiſes, as we have hinted already: which occaſion'd the diſperſion of the greateſt part of <hi>Fauſt's</hi> ſervants whom we muſt ſuppoſe by that time to have been very numerous: theſe ſeeing the deplorable condition to which that noble city was reduc'd, and the difficulty of carrying on the buſineſs any longer with that freedom and encouragement they had till then enjoy'd; and being perhaps inclin'd enough of themſelves to leave their maſters, to go ſettle in ſome of the moſt famous cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> where they were ſure to gain, not only wealth and honour, but the friendſhip of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, immediately diſperſed themſelves and ſettled, ſome in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cities of <hi>Cologn</hi> and <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> others went to <hi>Rome, Venice, Paris, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0712300300:120"/>
where they ſoon met with all the encouragement they could wiſh: this happen'd, as we have hinted in the former book in the year 1462. So that <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer,</hi> had happily conceal'd the art from the reſt of the world, at leaſt the ſpace of <hi>twelve</hi> years from the time of its being perfected: we muſt, however, except one of his ſervants <hi>viz. Nic. Jenſon,</hi> who if the date of his firſt book be true and genuine, muſt have given his maſter the ſlip before that fatal period, ſince we find this book finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Venice an.</hi> 1461 with great advantage and improvement; we ſhall have occaſion to enquire further into this man and his work, in the ſequel of this book: however, if we except this one ſingle work, we don't find any footſteps of the infant art, being carry'd out of its nurſe's arms du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe twelve years.</p>
                  <p>BUT now we muſt conſider it in a different view, diſperſing it ſelf over divers nations, patroniz'd by Popes and Kings, and eſteem'd a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing to mankind. It ſeems now to have left the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> where it yet ſhines there brighter than ever; and at the ſame inſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf at <hi>Rome, Venice, Oxford</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> and in a ſpace ſhorter than can be imagin'd, becomes conſpicuous over all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As there is ſo great a number and variety of events and remarkable occurrences, which happen'd in ſeveral cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> at the ſame time, or immediately after one another, with reſpect to the firſt printers who ſettled there, the improvements made by them, and the encouragement they receiv'd; it will be abſolutely impoſſible to diſpoſe them in ſuch an order, as may give the reader at once a full view of them all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interrupting the ſeries, either with reſpect to time or place. Thus, for inſtance, while we ſhew the tranſactions at <hi>Rome,</hi> during the <hi>two</hi> or three firſt years, <hi>Venice, Paris, Oxford, Cologn, Milan, &amp;c.</hi> will open new ſcenes to our view, attracting our eyes towards them, and oblige us to break the thread of one to begin with that of another; which continual diverſions would rather confound than inſtruct the reader, and render the hiſtory confus'd and tedious. Our beſt annaliſts and hiſtorians being ſenſible of this, have follow'd a better method. Father <hi>Orlandi</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the lateſt that has wrote upon this ſubject, hath taken that of <hi>De la Caille;</hi> who proceeds with every city by it ſelf, from the time it is ſuppos'd to have receiv'd the art, to the end of the century, according to their faireſt claim to priority in point of time; and then goes on with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0712300300:121"/>
the next in order. This method I have choſe, and given under the head of each city the names, character and merit, of each printer that has wrought there, from the time of its receiving the art to the end of the year 1500; and pointed out the excellencies of thoſe who have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this art, either by the beauty of their types, the elegance and correctneſs of their works, the number of their editions, or any improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they made. By this means, I hope the reader will clearly ſee the early progreſs of printing in every place; if not at one view, yet at leaſt in ſuch an order as more eaſily to form an idea, not only of the printers and cities wherein they reſided, but likewiſe of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patrons for wealth, learning, &amp;c. of that time, to whoſe character and merit, I have not failed to do juſtice throughout this whole work.</p>
                  <p>I propos'd at firſt to have clos'd this hiſtory with the fifteenth century; but when I came to conſider that the moſt eminent printers, to whom we owe many important improvements of this art, ſuch as <hi>Aldus</hi> at <hi>Venice, Amerbach</hi> and <hi>Froben</hi> at <hi>Baſil, Badius</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> with many others, did not begin to appear upon this ſtage, till almoſt the cloſe of it: and that their merit was not diſcover'd till the beginning of the next; I thought it an unpardonable injuſtice to them and my readers, to curtail their hiſtory by too ſcrupulouſly adhering to my propos'd epocha; and therefore have choſen to continue this hiſtory <hi>twenty</hi> years longer, <hi>i. e.</hi> to 1520; and ſometimes made an excurſion beyond that time, when ever any of thoſe excellent maſters have outliv'd it. This has afforded me another agreeable opportunity, <hi>viz.</hi> of mentioning ſome others who did not enter the province of printing till after the fifteenth century.</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER motive which induc'd me to continue this hiſtory 20 years longer, was, that I found all the improvements that had been made to the art, were made by that time <hi>i. e.</hi> by the year 1520 at leaſt; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them was ſo far lay'd before that year, that whatever has been done ſince, either with relation to the beauty of letter, elegancy of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, variety of types, printing in different languages, eſpecially in the eaſtern ones, in different columns, correctneſs and the like, all theſe and many more, had already been carry'd on to ſuch a perfection before this time, that it admitted but of ſmall improvements to be made to it afterwards. I have therefore thought it a much better period to cloſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0712300300:122"/>
this hiſtory with, than that of 1500 where <hi>Orlandi</hi> concludes his; this has given me an opportunity of mentioning not only the improvements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but likewiſe thoſe glorious printers to whom we owe them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as it would ſwell this book too much to inſert the names of all the printers, that appear'd within thoſe 20 years, they being too numerous, and a great many of them, deſerving rather to be remember'd with ſhame than honour: I have reſolv'd to ſpeak only of thoſe who ſignaliz'd themſelves, either for ſome improvements they made to the art, the beauty and correctneſs of their editions, or any other merit they have been conſpicuous for: it is for that reaſon I have choſen to ſpeak of them in a chapter by it ſelf, after I have clos'd the 15th century, to which I ſhall alſo add in another chapter, an account of the abuſes which crept into the art from its promulgation to 1520, that there may be nothing wanting to make this hiſtory as compleat and inſtructing as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>IT will be neceſſary to acquaint the reader that tho' we have follow'd the method of the beſt annaliſts, in ſettling the priority of every city, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the date of the oldeſt extant work, that was printed there, which is certainly the ſureſt way and leaſt liable to miſtakes; yet it is more than probable that they might receive the art much ſooner: ſeeing ſome time muſt reaſonably be allow'd for ſetting up a printing-houſe, and furniſhing it with the neceſſary apparatus, which in the infancy of the art was more difficult to procure, for want of proper workmen acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the branches of ſuch a tedious work, for which leſs than a year or two could ſcarce ſuffice: and becauſe we are not abſolutely ſure that thoſe editions, which we give for their firſt, were really ſo: Mr. <hi>Mattaire,</hi> who has taken ſuch pains to ſearch the beſt libraries of <hi>London, Oxford, Paris,</hi> &amp;c. for thoſe old monuments, that he thought he had exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that ſubject, has nevertheleſs poſt dated the claim and rank of ſeveral cities by ſome years; if <hi>Orlandi</hi> may be credited, who afterwards rectify'd them by the diſcovery of ſome older editions; and who can tell what time may produce, that may wholly invert our preſent order: thus for inſtance ſome of the hiſtorians quoted in the laſt book, tell us that <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Cologn, Francford,</hi> &amp;c. receiv'd the art before any others; yet as we have none of their works extant, but ſuch as were printed ſome years

after, we have been oblig'd to give them a lower rank, and place them after <hi>Rome, Paris, Venice,</hi> &amp;c. The reader may eaſily remember that <hi>Guttenbergh</hi> left <hi>Mentz,</hi> and ſettled at <hi>Strasburgh</hi> ſome years before the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> before <hi>ann.</hi> 1462; and that he taught <hi>John Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> the Art in the latter: yet we meet with no edition done there of older date than 1471, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Decretum Gratiani</hi> printed by <hi>Henry Egeſtein.</hi> Tho' <hi>Cologn</hi> receiv'd ſome of <hi>Fauſt's</hi> fugitive ſervants ſoon after his rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> yet the oldeſt edition there, as yet known, is the works of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> I, printed 1470. What became of thoſe impreſſions before that time, is ſcarce worth our enquiring, ſince the beſt of thoſe which have been ſince publiſh'd, are far inferior to thoſe done in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> &amp;c. in beauty of character, elegancy of compoſition, correctneſs and choice of MSS to print after; while themſelves proved indolent enough to neglect thoſe improvements even after they had been made in other countries.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER 'tis probable they might have ſufficient buſineſs in printing ſmall books of devotion, lives of ſaints, and legends; which, according to the taſt of thoſe times, and of that nation in particular, were eagerly bought up and thumb'd over, 'till ſcarce a leaf was left; while the men of learning and politeneſs were more curious in laying up ſuch only as were a credit not only to the author and Printer, but to the Art it ſelf. But however that be, I hope what I have ſaid will ſufficiently convince the reader, how cautious we ſhould be in fixing the epocha's, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the rank and claims of every city, in this reſpect; ſince we know not but the next diligent ſearcher may find matter enough to give this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new turn.</p>
                  <p>I have ſhown in the cloſe of the laſt book to what a degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Art of Printing was advanc'd even before the year 1467, and given there ſome account of that noble edition of <hi>Nich. Jenſon,</hi> which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be done <hi>ann.</hi> 1461, with the encomium which Mr. <hi>Mattaire,</hi> to whom we are beholden for the firſt account of it, about <hi>eight</hi> years ago, gives to that maſter-piece of the Art, ſince which I ſaw it at the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>'s. What ſeems ſtrange in that Printer, is, that from the time of this date 1461 to 1471, not one of his impreſſions is to be met with; ſo that neither their beauty, nor the eſteem which they merited among the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0712300300:124"/>
have been able to preſerve them, unleſs they are ſtill latent in ſome libraries, 'till ſome accident brings them to light, as happen'd to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor Puellarum.</hi> 'Tis unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that a man, who could, in ſo ſhort a time improve the Art, to a degree equal to the beſt Printers of the next age, and publiſh'd ſo many excellent volumes from 1470 to 1480, ſhould have continued idle for <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> years.</p>
                  <p>FOR this reaſon many learned perſons are of opinion that the date of the book is wrong printed, and that one of the X's was either careleſsly or wilfully omitted, or taken up by the balls: but Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> will by no means allow this ſuppoſition, and gives his reaſons againſt it. But tho' I am partly of his opinion, yet there are two reaſons that induce me to differ from father <hi>Orlandi,</hi> in allowing the preference to <hi>Venice</hi> before theſe laſt mention'd cities: the firſt is that this impreſſion of the <hi>Decor Puellarum,</hi> doth not mention the place where it was done, and therefore might as well have been printed in any other place as at <hi>Venice;</hi> our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts give no other reaſon for its being done there rather than any where elſe, but that <hi>Jenſon</hi> is found, ten years after the date of it, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in that city for the ſpace of another ten years; but how to fill the chaſm of the firſt ten is what they are at a great loſs, as we ſhall ſee by and by. My ſecond reaſon is that had this book been really printed at <hi>Venice, ann.</hi> 1461, it would have been abſurd for the two <hi>Spires,</hi> who did not ſettle th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> the title of the firſt perſons who taught the city of <hi>Venice</hi> the art of printing, or if they had, I doubt not but <hi>Jenſon</hi> would have taken care to have confuted ſuch an aſſumption in ſome of his own works, which he never did: allowing therefore the date of this work to be genuine, yet it would be too preſumptive to build the claim of that city upon a book, which for ought appears was not printed there.</p>
                  <p>I have ven ur'd to ſay ſo much concerning this impreſſion, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, becauſe of its being dated one year before the time our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book begins; ſo that it could not ſo properly be brought into the book itſelf, without antedating of it by that one year for the ſake of one impreſſion. Before Mr <hi>Mattaire</hi> gave us an account of it in his <hi>Annal. Typogr.</hi> moſt authors gave the city of <hi>Rome</hi> the preference, to that of <hi>Venice</hi> by at leaſt 4 or 5 years; and with reſpect to the latter the two
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0712300300:125"/>
                     <hi>Spires</hi> were allow'd to have been the firſt Printers there, according to the verſes that are at the end of their firſt works: this impreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth at moſt prove <hi>Jenſon</hi> to have began to print ſome where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe two brothers were ſettled at <hi>Venice.</hi> What diſcoveries may be made hereafter, which may perhaps invert the preſent order, is what I am not concern'd about at preſent: my buſineſs is to ſettle it now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt light I have been able to get. I hope the reader will excuſe me, if the reſpect which I bear to thoſe noble cities, who gave the firſt encouragement to this infant Art, hath made me ſomewhat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, and what he may perhaps call over curious in ſettling this point of precedency; for ſince it may be ſo eaſily ſettled and adjuſted from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic records, it would have been an unpardonable omiſſion in me to have neglected it; ſeeing every one of thoſe cities do ſtill value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their rank, and have taken all poſſible pains to find out all the old monuments that would both ſupport and advance their reſpective claims.</p>
                  <p>I know that ſome annaliſts, in order to fill up the chaſm of <hi>nine</hi> years, have ſuppos'd that <hi>Jenſon</hi> went from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he taught the Art of Printing, and ſet up ſome preſſes, and inſtructed ſeveral, who became eminent Printers. But this is improbable on many accounts; 1. Becauſe there are none of his works done at <hi>Paris;</hi> 2. Becauſe his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is much finer than any us'd in <hi>France</hi> by the firſt Printers there; 3. Becauſe he would have met with ſuch encouragement there, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering it was his native country, that there had been no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to return to <hi>Venice; laſtly,</hi> becauſe, if he had taught ſo many ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workmen in the Art, of which himſelf was then by far the greateſt maſter, it would have been unneceſſary to ſend for the three partners out of <hi>Germany,</hi> who did not however come to that city 'till about the year 1469, that is, <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>ſeven</hi> years after his ſuppos'd coming thither. To this we may add, that upon this ſuppoſition the Art muſt have been brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſeveral years ſooner than the moſt authentick records, and the beſt writers allow, which ſeems as improbable; as it is difficult to aſſign a place where <hi>Jenſon</hi> printed this work. From all which, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the date of the <hi>Decor Puellarum,</hi> as no place is mention'd where it

                     <p>IF thoſe cities which gave the earlieſt invitations and encouragements to the Art of Printing, do ſo juſtly merit to be recorded in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ranks, that of <hi>Mentz</hi> certainly deſerves to be placed at the head of them, upon two accounts; 1. becauſe it was the mother and inventreſs of it; and 2. becauſe it ſtill continued to promote and cheriſh it, after it had been reduc'd to a foreign yoke. In the firſt book we conſider'd her in the former view, whilſt ſhe was the only one in the world, that engroſs'd both the Art and Artiſts to herſelf: but the conqueror's ſword was the occaſion of its being diſpers'd through the moſt eminent cities of <hi>Europe:</hi> 'till this time the beſt of <hi>Fauſt's</hi> ſervants being tyed by an oath of ſecrecy, and perhaps by ſome more powerful engagement, had not dar'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their maſter; and if ſome few had ventur'd to break through their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, yet were they ſtill ſo imperfectly acquainted with the Art, that they never perform'd any work that could abide the teſt of time, if we except <hi>N. Jenſon</hi>'s: but now as the city was depriv'd of its freedom and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, it aboliſh'd the difference between maſter and ſervant, citizen and foreigner; they began to look upon themſelves as free from all former ties, and at liberty to accept of the invitations which they receiv'd from <hi>England, Italy, France,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that in the ſpace of very few years, there was ſcarce a metropolis or conſiderable city, where there was not one or more Printing-houſes ſet up: ſeveral monaſteries likewiſe began to entertain thoſe fugitives very early, as we ſhall ſhow anon; and wherever any of thoſe workmen chanc'd to ſettle themſelves, they did not fail of meeting
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0712300300:127"/>
with all the aſſiſtance and encouragement, which the moſt eminent men either for power or learning could give them. However as they cannot be ſuppos'd to have been all men of equal capacity and induſtry, ſo we need not wonder if they did not ſignalize themſelves every where alike; but whilſt one ſort of them did in a ſhort ſpace improve the Art to a very conſiderable degree, others of a more ſluggiſh nature, contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with going on in their old way, and ſome of them even from bad to worſe.</p>
                     <p>WE need not doubt but that <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer,</hi> during this ſad inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, were as much courted by other nations to leave <hi>Mentz,</hi> and betake themſelves to a place of greater tranquillity, and in a more flouriſhing ſtate: but their love to their native city, which had favour'd them ſo much in its proſperity, prevail'd upon them to continue there, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their buſineſs, as before. This is apparent from the liſt of their works, given in the firſt book; and the edition of the great <hi>Bible</hi> which they printed in this very year, with that of <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices three</hi> years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, gives ground to ſuppoſe, that the merit of this invention procur'd them ſome particular regard and privilege from Archbiſhop <hi>Adolph,</hi> as ſoon as it became known to him; which might induce them to go on with the buſineſs, as they had done formerly: however if they printed nothing between the year 1462 and 1465, (as we don't as yet find that they did) we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the confuſion in which the city then was, might obſtruct it for that time, ſince we don't find ſuch a length of time between any of their other works: the truth is, we have very few or no particulars concerning them, except what we have given in the firſt book, wherein I endeavour'd as well as I could to trace <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s hiſtory to the end of his life. All that we can add concerning <hi>Peter Schoeffer,</hi> is, that he continued printing ſeveral conſiderable volumes 'till the year 1479, which he then ſubſcrib'd with his own name, and to ſome of which (towards the latter end of his life) he added his coat of arms, which might in all probability have been given to him either by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or ſome crown'd head: accordingly we find theſe words added to his colophons, <hi>Suis conſignando ſcutis,</hi> that they were mark'd with his own arms. He left a ſon <hi>John Schoeffer,</hi> who became likewiſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Printer at <hi>Mentz;</hi> but he muſt in all likelihood have been very
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0712300300:128"/>
young when his father dy'd, ſeeing we find nothing printed by him 'till <hi>ann.</hi> 1503, when he acquainted his readers in the colophons to his firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that he was the ſon of <hi>Peter Schoeffer</hi> and grandſon to <hi>J. Fauſt, &amp;c.</hi> the firſt inventors of the Art; and that himſelf was an excellent maſter of it, and an eminent citizen <hi>(primarius civis)</hi> of the metropolis of <hi>Mentz,</hi> but as this is beyond my propos'd epocha, I ſhall ſay no more of him.</p>
                     <p>I don't find any other Printer in the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> during <hi>Peter Schoeffer</hi>'s life: about 1480, we meet with one ſingle work of no great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence done there by one <hi>Erhard Rewick,</hi> and between the year 1470 and 1500, there are about <hi>fifteen</hi> impreſſions printed there without any Printer's name; and therefore are ſuppos'd to have been done by ſome of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſervants, who dared not put their names to them, whilſt <hi>Schoeffer</hi> and his ſon liv'd.</p>
                     <p>THO' I do not deſign to ſwell the following book with a liſt of the works done in every city, it having been done by the indefatigable Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire</hi> and father <hi>Orlandi,</hi> but only to give my readers an account of the moſt eminent Printers, that have ſignaliz'd themſelves in any of them, with the names and dates of the leſs conſiderable ones; yet I hope the reader will forgive me, if my reſpect for <hi>P.

                     <p>THE next place, that we know of, which ſignaliz'd it ſelf in the Art of Printing, is the monaſtery of <hi>Subiaco,</hi> in <hi>latin Monaſterum Subla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> in the territories of <hi>Campania,</hi> in the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Pope; the monks of which are of the <hi>Benedictin</hi> order, and very rich, having the lordſhip of no leſs than fourteen caſtles.

What is ſtill more ſurprizing is, that <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s quotations from the <hi>Greek</hi> authors are printed in a very neat <hi>Greek</hi> letter, and extremely like that which the firſt Printers of <hi>Rome, Conrard Sweyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heym</hi> and <hi>Arnold Pannartz,</hi> became noted for. This induc'd father <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landi</hi> to think it was one of the firſt eſſays, which thoſe two <hi>Germans</hi> made in that convent, before they went to <hi>Rome;</hi> but this can by no means be allow'd, becauſe tho' the character be like theirs, yet it appears by the <hi>eight</hi> firſt impreſſions, which they printed at <hi>Rome;</hi> that they had no <hi>Greek</hi> alphabet 'till <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> years after the date of this impreſſion, as we ſhall ſee in the next chapter: the following colophon is at the end of it.</p>

of the pontificate of <hi>Paul</hi> II. under the patronage of <hi>John Andreas</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Aleria,</hi> who was the Popes library-keeper, juſtly fam'd for his learning and generoſity. Theſe printers aſſiſted with that prelates purſe, did immediately prepare an elegant, round, <hi>Roman</hi> character, and a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of the fineſt paper; they invented likewiſe ſuch variety of ſpaces, as kept a beautiful diſtance between the words, and made their impreſſions appear with the greateſt neatneſs and exactneſs. Their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were broad, and not only added a grace to the pages, but render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them likewiſe convenient for the writing of notes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their ink was ſo excellent, that it ſtill looks as freſh as if newly printed. In ſhort, they were perſons who valu'd their credit, and the honour of pleaſing their patron more than riches; and ſpar'd neither coſt nor labour, in order to make their impreſſions as beautiful and correct, as poſſible; which any one that has ſeen them, will own with pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but the great acquaintance amongſt the learned, which their noble patron's friendſhip procur'd them, might be a great means of their improving the art to ſuch a degree; ſeeing ſuch perſons were beſt able to diſcover the faults and inconveniences of the firſt printed books, which theſe <hi>Germans</hi> might more eaſily rectify when they became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. Theſe two partners ſettled themſelves in the houſe of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Francis de Maximis,</hi> brothers and Roman knights; where the Biſhop of <hi>Aleria</hi> not only furniſh'd them with the moſt valuable manuſcripts, out of the <hi>Vatican</hi> and other libraties, but alſo prepar'd them himſelf, corrected their proofs, and prefix'd prefaces and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications to their works, in order to recommend them the more to the learned world. This laborious taſk was follow'd by him with ſuch application, that he ſcarce allow'd himſelf time to ſleep. What a value this great Biſhop had both for the art and theſe two great maſters of it, appears from his dedication to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> II. prefix'd to the edition of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> which I ſhall now give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader a tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It was, ſays he, in your days, that among many other divine favours this bleſſing was beſtow'd on the Chriſtian world, that every poor ſcholar can purchaſe for himſelf a library for a ſmall ſum,—that thoſe volumes, which heretofore could ſcarce be bought for an hundred crowns, may now be procur'd for leſs than twenty, very well

This excited them to approve themſelves worthy of all that eſteem, which was ſhew'd them, by publiſhing a vaſt number of elegant impreſſions, ſome of which were ſo large that they could not be done without great labor and charges, as will be evident from the liſt of their works, which they preſented to the Pope, of which we ſhall give an account in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>WHAT their firſt impreſſion was, whether <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Familiar Epiſtles,</hi> or St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s book <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> is what authors can by no means agree about; that the former was printed at <hi>Rome ann.</hi> 1467, with a latin epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, at the end of which their names are at full length; and on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year, a new edition of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s book <note n="1" place="bottom">Anno igitur eodem 1468, opus <hi>Auguſtini de Civitate Dei</hi> eruditiſſimum; <hi>Epiſtolas Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymi</hi> diſertiſſimas, cum luminibus orationis tum viribus argumentorum inſtructas vulgaverunt.—Anno ſuperiore <hi>Tullianas</hi> dederant <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolas,</hi> hoc dant <hi>Hieronymianas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Annal.

                  <p>I have already hinted their method of managing the <hi>Greek</hi> quotations, which they follow'd in the firſt volumes they printed, that is 'till the middle of the year 1469: perhaps were they forc'd to it for want of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to cut the <hi>Greek</hi> alphabet; but at length, notwithſtanding the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of that tongue might have excus'd them from the labour and expence of procuring ſetts of punches and matrices for Printing in that language, and the difficulty of finding workmen fit for ſuch a task, they ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every obſtacle of this nature, and form'd a compleat <hi>Greek</hi> alphabet, which they us'd in the edition of <hi>Aulus Gellius.</hi> Concerning this edition the Biſhop of <hi>Aleria</hi> ſpeaks thus; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"However, this prov'd a very ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous taſk at firſt;—for a great part of the <hi>Latin</hi> was corrupted thro' the negligence of the tranſcribers; and a much greater part of the <hi>Greek</hi> deprav'd, maim'd, and mutilated.

The quotations, which are long and more frequent, than in any other author, are printed in a fair <hi>Greek</hi> character, conſidering this kind of printing was but in its infancy; and what is extremely remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they were ſo correctly printed, that, as we are aſſur'd by Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire,</hi> in two whole pages, which contain'd ſeventy ſix lines of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable length, there were but <hi>fourteen</hi> faults of impreſſion.

                     </hi> where he has ſet down thoſe places, which were wrong printed, in order to convince the world, by the ſmallneſs of their number, of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and diligence of thoſe two Printers.</p>
                  <p>HE tells us likewiſe that their <hi>Greek</hi> character was ſomewhat large, round and even, without accents, ligatures, abbreviations, or any thing that might perplex the reader, except only that ſometimes two or more words were join'd together without any ſpace between them; and that the periods had either no full ſtop, or one in the wrong place; ſo that a perſon, not us'd to MSS. was doubtful where the ſenſe ended. To this edition was prefix'd a dedicatory Epiſtle of the Biſhop of <hi>Aleria</hi> to the Pope, wherein he acknowledges the kindneſs of his Holineſs and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> in ſupplying him with money in his greateſt exigencies; and promiſes to proceed with the utmoſt induſtry in furniſhing the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world with new productions from the preſs.

I ſhall only give a <hi>latin</hi> octaſtich, which was printed at the end of ſeveral of their impreſſions, in commendation of the printers; wherein the poet apologizes for the harſhneſs of their <hi>German</hi> names, offenſive without doubt to an <hi>Italian</hi> ear.

HITHER TO we have ſeen the flouriſhing ſtate of this preſs, which in the ſpace of ſix or ſeven years at moſt, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>ann.</hi> 1467 to 1472, oblig'd the world with no leſs than twelve thouſand four hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty five volumes, in eight and twenty editions, ſome of them very large, and all beautiful and correct; ſo that if their vaſt labours and coſt had met with ſuitable ſucceſs, they muſt have rais'd a prodigious eſtate. But, whatever be the cauſe, 'tis certain that the greateſt part of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary remain'd ſtill in their hands for want of buyers; which reduc'd them to the moſt neceſſitous circumſtances. Father <hi>Orlandi</hi> endeavours to account for this ill-ſucceſs, by ſuppoſing that their impreſſions, being in Roman character, were diſlik'd in thoſe days, becauſe the learned had been ſo accuſtom'd to the old Gothick, as not to approve of this new, tho' preferable one. This conjecture ſeems the more probable upon two accounts; 1. Becauſe ſeveral eminent printers were oblig'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the taſt of the age, and uſe the old character, reſembling that of MSS. 2. Moſt of the firſt Printers of <hi>Paris, Venice, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. who began with the Roman, were forc'd by degrees to reſume the old Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick, which continu'd till almoſt the middle of the next century, and prov'd the ruin of many valuable impreſſions in divers parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> However that be, our two <hi>Germans</hi> under theſe preſſing exigencies had recourſe to their great patron, who immediately drew up a petition in their names and behalf to Pope <hi>Xyſtus</hi> IV, ſubjoin'd to the fifth volume of <hi>Nich. de Lyra</hi>'s <hi>Gloſſ.</hi> and preſented on the 20th of <hi>March</hi> 1472. In this he repreſents their great merit and miſery in the moſt pathetick terms imaginable; gives a catalogue of all the volumes printed by them, the greateſt part of which was ſtill unſold; prays his Holineſs to conſider their deplorable caſe; and declares their readineſs to deliver up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold books either to him, or to whomſoever he ſhould command, for their preſent ſubſiſtance. The Biſhop, to ſhew that he was ſenſibly touch'd with their misfortune, prefaceth the petition in his own name, and requeſts the Pope to hear the juſt complaint of his worthy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Printers; and afterwards expoſes their circumſtances in their own words.

uſeful invention in <hi>Italy,</hi> implore your aſſiſtance.—This is the voice of thoſe printers, who labour under ſuch a load of printed vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, that they muſt ſink under it, unleſs timely reliev'd by you.—We were the firſt of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who introduc'd this excellent art, with vaſt labour and coſt, into your territories, in the time of your predeceſſor; and encourag'd, by our example, other printers to do the ſame. If you peruſe the catalogue of the works printed by us, you will admire how and where we could procure a ſufficient quantity of paper, or even rags, for ſuch a number of volumes.—The books, done by us, are ſubjoin'd in the following order."</p>

                  <p>THE liſt of thoſe books conſiſting entirely of <hi>Latin,</hi> I have put them with the original of the petition in the margin, and have added the date of the year wherein each was printed, as far as it could be procur'd, there being none in the catalogue. The order of time is not obſerv'd, but only the number of copies of each. We may likewiſe infer what book were then moſt eſteem'd, not upon the account of their authors, but of their uſefulneſs, by the proportionate number printed of them. The petition thus proceeds.</p>

                  <p>THUS were theſe indigent perſons oblig'd to expoſe their miſery to the world; with what ſucceſs, I cannot learn: tho' it is evident from their printing a conſiderable time after, as ſhall be ſhewn, that ſome method muſt have been taken to extricate them from thoſe wretched cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. <hi>Sweynheim</hi> indeed publiſh'd nothing after the year 1473, and for that reaſon is ſuppos'd by ſome to have dy'd about that time; yet his partner <hi>Pannartz</hi> continu'd printing till <hi>ann.</hi> 1476, in a ſmaller character than what was us'd by him in company with the former. It will not perhaps be amiſs to remark that the word <hi>quinternio</hi> in the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tranſlated by us <hi>Quire-books,</hi> ſignifies a quire of five ſheets ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that they are put into one another by the book-binder, and the <hi>firſt</hi> ſheet contains the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> of the 10 leaves, the <hi>ſecond</hi> the 2d and 9th, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this method oblig'd 'em to compoſe <hi>twenty</hi> whole pages of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before they work'd it off at preſs; and requir'd a prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of letter to every Font. All the editions of theſe two partners as yet known, from their firſt ſettlement at <hi>Rome, ann.</hi> 1467 to 1473 in which <hi>Sweynheim</hi> is thought to have dy'd, are 40 in number, all folio's and in <hi>latin;</hi> ſome of them pretty conſiderable, ſuch were their Bible of 1471 mention'd in the former book in two large volumes, and <hi>Nicol. de Lyra</hi> in five larger ones; the works of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſirnam'd the Great, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for thoſe which <hi>Pannartz</hi> printed afterwards by himſelf, we have not been able to diſcover above ſix, all <hi>latin</hi> folio's, but none ſo conſiderable as the three

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0712300300:145"/>
that the <hi>Gauls</hi> or <hi>French</hi> being diſcover'd by the noiſe of the geeſe one night in their attempt to ſurprize the <hi>Roman</hi> Capitol, a countryman of theirs had found out a way to be reveng'd of them, by teaching the world an art of writing without the help of their quills. Theſe verſes are annex'd to an edition of <hi>T. Livy</hi> by <hi>U. Han</hi> without date, and quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſeveral authors.</p>
                  <p>MICH. FERNUS in his life of that Biſhop tells us, that he learn'd this epigram of a <hi>Turk,</hi> whom he met with in a journey to the Pope's territories; and who gave him account of his converſion to the chriſtian religion, and his early love of eloquence, which induc'd him to leave <hi>Turky</hi> and come to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee the famous <hi>Paul</hi> II. and <hi>Campanus,</hi> whoſe works he had carefully collected; and amongſt other things recited this epigram. However, 'tis evident that he was a <hi>German</hi> by his adding the name of his country to that of <hi>Gallus</hi> in ſeveral of his editions. Thus, in that of <hi>Cicero de Oratore, ann.</hi> 1468. he calls himſelf <hi>Ulricum Gallum de Wienâ;</hi> in St <hi>Auſtin de civitate Dei ann.</hi> 1474, <hi>Ulricum Gallum Almanum;</hi> in ſome others <hi>Ulricum Gallum de Bienna</hi> &amp; <hi>de Ingolſtat. Wimpheling</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to prove him a <hi>German</hi> againſt <hi>Fernus,</hi> who in his life of <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> chang'd <hi>Gallus</hi> into <hi>Gallicus</hi> to make him an abſolute <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and aſcrib'd this miſtake to his having tranſlated his name into <hi>latin;</hi> which, as <hi>Hermolaus Barbarus</hi> aſſerts, ought never to be done. But in this he did no more than what was frequent among the <hi>Germans</hi> and others, who to ſoften the harſhneſs of their ſirnames, either alter'd or latiniz'd them; ſo <hi>Fuſt</hi> chang'd his into <hi>Fauſtus, Schoeffer</hi> into <hi>Opilio, Leichtenſtein</hi> into <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi lapis, des Rouges</hi> into <hi>de Rubeis,</hi> and the learned <hi>Stephens</hi> into <hi>Stephanus;</hi> which cuſtom ſtill prevails in foreign parts: and the famous Monſ. <hi>le Clerc</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſtiles himſelf <hi>Joan.

                  </p>
                  <p>THE time of his firſt coming to <hi>Rome</hi> is not eaſily determin'd. Some affirm that he was ſettled there before <hi>Sweynheim</hi> and <hi>Pannartz,</hi> as <hi>Wimpheling, Monſ. Naude,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Mentel;</hi> but this ſeems improbable upon two accounts. 1. Becauſe we have no edition of his ſo ancient as thoſe of the two laſt nam'd; 2. Becauſe the Bp. of <hi>Aleria,</hi> who was the editor of all the firſt impreſſions of theſe, determines in their favour; and his teſtimony is of much greater weight in this caſe, than that of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0712300300:146"/>
thoſe writers. He attributes <hi>the honour to</hi> Sweynheim, <hi>&amp;c. of having founded the firſt Printing-houſe at</hi> Rome, <hi>and brought the Art from</hi> Germany, <hi>in the preceding Popes reign, and by their example encourag'd others to do the like;</hi> as he ſpeaks in the petition to <hi>Xyſtus</hi> IV, above quoted. Now <hi>Xyſtus</hi>'s predeceſſor was <hi>Paul</hi> II, who was advanc'd to that dignity in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1464; and in his days they came to <hi>Rome.</hi> If <hi>Campanus,</hi> the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of <hi>Ulric,</hi> had known of his ſettling there before them, he would certainly have contradicted the Bp. of <hi>Aleria,</hi> and maintain'd the prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the man, who, under his protection, prov'd ſo indefatigable in his buſineſs, that himſelf was engag'd night and day in reviſing his works <note n="1" place="bottom">Cum <hi>Uldricus</hi> quidam <hi>Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

                     </note>. The merit of this Printer appears from his fine impreſſions, and the choice that his patron made of him to publiſh thoſe works, which he had procur'd and corrected with the utmoſt application, as well as from the praiſes, which he gives him in his prefatory epiſtles and verſes. We find by the liſt of his books, that he frequently neglected the date of the impreſſion and his own name. The former defect is ſupplied, as far as poſſible, from ſome material circumſtances, either in the epiſtles affix'd to them, or elſewhere in the book; and the latter by a diligent compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one edition with another; for there is ſome peculiar difference between the characters of the firſt Printers, by which a nice obſerver may judge of the author.</p>
                  <p>THUS Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> remarks that the types of <hi>Con. Sweynheim</hi> and <hi>Arn. Pannartz,</hi> were eaſily known by their having a long <hi>ſ</hi> at the end of words, the <hi>i</hi> without a point, and no diphthongs: thoſe of <hi>Nic. Jenſon</hi> were much more round and neat, with the diphthongs, ae and oe; whereas <hi>Jo. Spires</hi> made uſe of e for ae, and <hi>Ulric Han</hi> uſes a ſingle <hi>e</hi> inſtead of a diphthong.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT 1473, <hi>Han</hi> took <hi>Simon Nicolai de Luca</hi> into partnerſhip with him till the end of the year 1474, after which he printed by himſelf till 1476. There was alſo a brother of his, call'd <hi>Lupus Han,</hi> whoſe name ſtands alone in ſome of thoſe impreſſions, which are nevertheleſs allow'd to be <hi>Ulric's</hi>

                  <p>THE two <hi>Germans</hi> had reaſon to tell the Pope in their petition, that their example had encourag'd many more Printers to come and ſettle at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing we find no leſs than <hi>thirteen,</hi> who practis'd the ſame Art there between 1470 and 1490, beſides the brother of <hi>Uldric Han,</hi> and his partner <hi>Simon de Luca;</hi> and <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine</hi> of whom were actually ſettled there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few years after the two former; but as we have nothing left particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerning them, except their names and their works, we ſhall juſt mention them as they came in courſe of time.</p>

He ſet up his Printing-houſe in <hi>Campo di Fiore;</hi> and not only tranſlated his name <hi>Silber [Silver]</hi> into <hi>latin,</hi> but likewiſe into <hi>greek;</hi> ſo that ſome of his editions are ſubſcrib'd <hi>Achirion</hi> and <hi>Argyrion,</hi> others <hi>Argenteus,</hi> added to that of <hi>Franck.</hi> The works we have of his are <hi>twenty one</hi> in number, from <hi>ann.</hi> 1475 to 1500: however he continued printing there many years after, but either the greateſt part of theſe laſt have been loſt, or elſe he printed but little, ſince we meet only with two editions of his from 1500 to 1509, in Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi>'s annals.</p>

HIS correctors were <hi>Michael Fern</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Archipoeta, Bartholomeus Salicetus,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Regii;</hi> the firſt of whom collected with prodigious induſtry all biſhop <hi>Campanus</hi>'s works, which he caus'd to be printed in two different places within <hi>ſix</hi> months of each other, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> in the order in which he had digeſted them. Theſe impreſſions were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo incorrectly, that he was oblig'd to inſert an <hi>Errata</hi> in <hi>Silber</hi>'s edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherein he expreſſes a vaſt deal of indignation, that a work, in which he had labour'd ſo much, ſhould yet be publiſh'd ſo full of faults; and gives it the following title, <hi>Vis ex ſtulto demens, idemque ex demente in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus fieri? Libros</hi> Romae <hi>primus imprime, Corruptorum recognitio.</hi> After this he proceeds to the <hi>Errata,</hi> with an acknowledgement of his own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and endeavours to clear the Printers of others. He ſhows the care which he had taken to render the edition correct; but that his efforts were fruſtrated by the careleſſneſs of the Printers, who, being tir'd with a days labour, correct their proofs imperfectly, and frequently neglect or omit the author's corrections.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſequel of this hiſtory we ſhall have occaſion to mention ſome <hi>Errata's</hi> of a much greater length than the foregoing, which <hi>Fern</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains ſo loudly of, tho' this contain'd four large pages in <hi>fol.</hi> The two laſt Printers in this city before 1500 are:</p>
                  <p n="14">14. SIMON <hi>de Nicolo</hi> of <hi>Luca</hi> 1478, who had been ſometime partner to the fam'd <hi>Uldric Han,</hi> and of whom we have but one edition. And,</p>
                  <p n="15">15. PETER <hi>de Turre, ann.</hi> 1490, in which year he printed <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography</hi> in a large <hi>folio</hi> with maps and cutts, and in a beautiful character, <hi>[Orland.</hi> p. 79.] which is all that we have of his. We find about twenty more editions without Printer's names; however the reader will eaſily ſee by this liſt of Printers, and the ſcarcity of their works, that the Art began to dwindle very much before the cloſe of the century; and if he conſults Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> upon the next, he will find it ſtill much thinner of both; but whether for want of encouragement, or what other cauſe, is not my buſineſs to enquire.</p>

                     <p>TOURS is an Archiepiſcopal city of <hi>France;</hi> in which we meet with but one book printed. This, 'tho done in an old <hi>Gothick</hi> character, (which was not as yet us'd in any place but <hi>Mentz)</hi> is ſo elegant, that it may be eſteem'd a maſter-piece of that kind. 'Tis to be regretted, that the Printer of ſuch an excellent work ſhould be unknown. The impreſſion was done in the Archbiſhop's palace; but if the reader upon that account, ſhall expect it to be a piece of devotion, he will be vaſtly miſtaken; for it is not unuſual with eccleſiaſticks of the moſt elevated ſtations in that church, to have a greater reliſh for gallantry than religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The book is the loves of <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Emilia;</hi> to which is ſubjoin'd another upon the ſame ſubject, tranſlated from <hi>Boccacio</hi> by <hi>Aretin,</hi> and is inſcrib'd as follows.</p>

                  <p>AS the city of <hi>Venice</hi> has excelled all others, not only in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of workmen and editions, but likewiſe in the goodneſs and excellency of them, I ſhall be forc'd to divide it into two chapters; in the firſt of which I ſhall ſpeak of thoſe Printers who flouriſh'd from its firſt ſettlement there by <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Vindelin de Spira,</hi> to the time of the great <hi>Aldus Manutius,</hi> whoſe merit alone will very well deſerve to be ſpoken of in a chapter by it ſelf, tho' there were no others to bear him company in it.</p>

In the mean time I beg leave to remind the reader of the remark upon this head, which we juſt hinted in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, <hi>viz.</hi> that the verſes at the end of the firſt impreſſion by <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Windelin</hi> of <hi>Spire ann.</hi> 1469, evidently prove them to have been the firſt who brought the Art to that city.

                     </note>. Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> who hath a particular regard for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman <hi>Jenſon,</hi> and firſt diſcover'd to the world the edition in diſpute, very juſtly intimates, that there was ſuch an emulation among the firſt Printers, that they made no ſcruple of claiming the priority from each other, right or wrong; either by falſe dates, as we hinted before, or by pompous verſes annex'd to their works; from which he infers a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that theſe two brothers might do ſo: whereas <hi>Jenſon,</hi> in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was too modeſt, to have been guilty of ſuch a piece of arrogance. For my part I can't ſee any neceſſity of accuſing either ſide of ſuch a fault, ſeeing they never charg'd each other with it; beſides <hi>Jenſon</hi> in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity printed his book ſomewhere elſe, and therefore might indeed be too modeſt when he came to <hi>Venice,</hi> to challenge the priority from them as to that place in particular. However, as to the point of modeſty, I own I am at a loſs to what ſide to give it, ſeeing all the firſt impreſſions, both of <hi>Jenſon</hi> and of the two brothers, are back'd with epigrams equally mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, and I don't ſee where there would have been the leaſt immodeſty in either to have aſcertain'd a juſt claim, againſt an unjuſt aſſuming ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. Let me add, that (if there was any wilfull miſtake on either ſide, which I think there was not) it is more probable <hi>Jenſon</hi> ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, than the two brothers; becauſe he might eaſily, if there was occaſion, excuſe it by making his date paſs for an error of impreſſion; whereas the two <hi>Germans</hi> publiſh'd themſelves, in words at length and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0712300300:153"/>
in the plaineſt terms, the firſt Printers at <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſo left no room for evaſion. I ſhall therefore begin with them, who were not inferior to <hi>Jenſon</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>JOHN and VINDELINE of SPIRE, 1469.</label>
THEY were natives of <hi>Germany,</hi> but whether of the city of <hi>Spire,</hi> whoſe name they bear, or whether that was only their ſirname, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine; for tho' ſome of the epigrams annex'd to their books ſeem to imply the former, yet it is difficult to affirm certainly that it was not a poetical licence, which, in this caſe, might have been more excuſable than that of <hi>Campanus</hi> upon <hi>Ulric Han,</hi> mention'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding chapter. However, 'tis plain that many of the <hi>German</hi> Printers had no other ſirnames than thoſe of the places wherein they were born.</p>
                  <p>THESE two brothers ſoon ſurpaſs'd all their predeceſſors in the beauty and neatneſs of their characters, and the elegance of their impreſſions, which to this time render them admir'd and eſteem'd by the curious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other ancient editions. <hi>Venice</hi> by this gain'd ſo much reputation for the fineneſs of her types, that ſome eminent Printers at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere either furniſh'd themſelves with ſetts of them, or endeavour'd to imitate them, acquainting their readers in their next impreſſions, that they were printed <hi>characteribus Venetianis,</hi> with <hi>Venetian</hi> types. <hi>Chevilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> indeed thinks this to have been an impoſition upon the world; nor can it be denied but that ſome of them pretended this, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend their own wretched performances. But this demonſtrates the ſuperior merit of that city, and the laudable emulation of her Printers, not only to excell thoſe of other places, but even one another. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe two brothers with <hi>John de Cologn</hi> and <hi>N. Jenſon,</hi> ſeem to have brought the Art to its utmoſt perfection, becauſe none of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Printers which ſucceeded till our time, ſuch as <hi>Vaſcoſan,</hi> the <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>'s, &amp;c. have ſurpaſs'd them in this reſpect; as well as becauſe this, like other arts, ſeem'd obnoxious to a certain fatality and decline, when carried to a particular height, as it happen'd in the ſpace of <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>ſeven</hi> years after their firſt ſettlement at <hi>Venice.</hi> What I mean is, that they ſhould ſo unaccountably ſuffer themſelves to be carry'd away by the degenerate

taſte of that age, and change their beautiful Roman character, for the old, obſolete and diſagreeable Gothick, which they began to print with about the year 1477.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Spires</hi> had the two following learned men for their correctors, <hi>viz. Chriſtopher Berardus</hi> of <hi>Piſauro,</hi> and <hi>George Alexandrinus; John,</hi> the elder brother, is reported to be the firſt who put the direction-word at the end of the page, and that upon good grounds, ſince no book, to our knowledge, before his <hi>Tacitus,</hi> hath it; the ſingular uſe of which is too obvious to want explanation. He liv'd no longer than to the year 1470, and was ſucceeded in the whole buſineſs by <hi>Windelin,</hi> who manag'd it with great applauſe by himſelf 'till 1472, in which year he took <hi>John de Cologn</hi> into partnerſhip with him. We find but one book, <hi>viz. Plautus,</hi> printed by them joyntly; ſo that it is probable each of them return'd ſoon after to his ſeparate preſs. This <hi>Windelin</hi> was ſo highly eſteem'd as a Printer even by his own countrymen, (a thing very uncommon!) that he was twice invited into <hi>Germany</hi> by ſome eminent counſellors at law of that nation, to print there the following conſiderable volumes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholi commentarium juridicum,</hi> which he perform'd <hi>ann.</hi> 1471, without the name of the place, adding only two verſes inſerted in the margin <note n="1" place="bottom">Hos <hi>Windelinus</hi> clara virtute magiſter Tranſcripſit; celeri formula preſſa pede. <hi>Mait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

NICH. JENSON is allow'd by the generality of writers to have been a Frenchman; and as he was one of the firſt of that nation, who was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this Art, all his countrymen have been more than ordinarily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh of their praiſes on him; ſo that whoever reads ſome of their encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, would be apt to think him the only Printer of merit in that age, and that there had never been any edition worth their conſideration, 'till it came out of his preſs; and this they did, even before they ſo much as dreamt of that early maſter-piece of his, the <hi>Decor Puellarum:</hi> we need not therefore wonder at Mr. <hi>Mattaire,</hi> if we find him ſo highly pleas'd at the diſcovery of this ſingular work; for it muſt be own'd, that unleſs we will diſpute the date of it, the higheſt encomiums muſt fall ſhort of his merit; ſince it will plainly follow, that he was not only the earlieſt by ſome years, who improv'd the Art, but likewiſe who brought it to its greateſt perfection, with reſpect to the fineneſs of his Roman characters, and elegancy of compoſition. Whereas were the ſuppoſition of thoſe, who think it antedated by <hi>ten</hi> years, to be allow'd, it will be manifeſt that there had already been ſeveral eminent Printers at <hi>Rome, Venice,</hi> and elſewhere before him, who introduc'd that noble and elegant character; and that tho' his ſhould be allow'd to be ſomewhat finer than thoſe of his predeceſſors, yet would his merit be inferior to theirs, and his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them be but ſmall in compariſon of that, which they made upon the old <hi>Moguntine</hi> types.

This method was follow'd by all his brethren, both in that city, and in ſeveral others of <hi>Europe;</hi> tho' it muſt be own'd that he far ſurpaſs'd the reſt even in that reſpect, and ſhow'd a more exact taſte and judgment; for his Gothic types had all the beauty and elegancy, which they were capable of, and may be ſtill read with pleaſure and admiration.</p>
                  <p>I don't find that he had any other corrector beſides <hi>Omnibon. Leonice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> above-mention'd, if we except <hi>Franciſcus Colutia Verzinenſis,</hi> who in his dedication prefix'd to the work of <hi>Palladius de Agricultura,</hi> of which he was the editor, tells <hi>Jenſon</hi> to whom he dedicates it, that it was at his deſire that he had undertaken to correct that work. By this it ſeems as if <hi>Jenſon</hi> was the firſt printer who had any of his impreſſions dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to himſelf. Moſt of his works, like thoſe of the two <hi>German</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have a <hi>latin</hi> epigram at the end in praiſe of him; but, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, not one of them ſpeaks of him as the firſt <hi>Venetian</hi> Printer,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0712300300:157"/>
which circumſtance alone would be ſufficient to juſtify us for poſtponing him to them. We meet with four of his editions printed in one year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1470, which ſhews him to have been a very diligent work-man. And in the ſpace of ten years, we have thirty-nine of them, ſtill extant; excluſive of the <hi>Decor Puellarum,</hi> beſides thoſe which may have been loſt, or are ſtill undiſcover'd. The firſt edition printed by him in <hi>Gothic</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, is St <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s book <hi>de Civitate Dei, anno</hi> 1475. the two laſt of his works are dated 1481.</p>

THESE two <hi>Germans</hi> came and ſettled at <hi>Venice,</hi> ſoon after the two <hi>Spires,</hi> and were equal to any of their contemporaries, in the beauty of their Roman types, the fineneſs of their paper, and elegance and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectneſs of their works. But they likewiſe gave into the Gothic way of printing; and it is obſervable that <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> have produc'd more of thoſe impreſſions, than almoſt all <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France</hi> together. Whether theſe Printers were more modeſt than their brethren, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but, however, in the liſt of their editions, we meet with none of thoſe pompous epigrams and panegyricks upon themſelves, ſo frequently us'd at that time. They took <hi>Nic. Jenſon</hi> into partnerſhip with them, towards the later part of their printing. <hi>John de Cologn</hi> is affirm'd by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0712300300:158"/>
ſome to have invented the <hi>Regiſtrum Chartarum</hi> about <hi>anno</hi> 1475; but it is obvious to the reader, from the catalogue of <hi>Uldric Han</hi>'s works at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the latter us'd it at leaſt two years before him.</p>
                  <p>THERE is one thing remarkable in one of their colophons, at the end of their editions of <hi>Valerius Maximus, fol. anno.</hi> 1474; and which, for that reaſon, I have ſubjoyn'd in the margin <note n="1" place="bottom">Venetiis impreſſoribus expoſitus fuit per <hi>Joh. de Cologn.

                  <p>HOWEVER it muſt be own'd, that all the works that came out of their preſs, or were printed for them, are an honour to them: the laſt liſt of their editions according to father <hi>Orlandi</hi> amounts to 28, from <hi>ann.</hi> 1471 to 1481.</p>

Thus he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued furniſhing his mind with every part of literature, in order to fit himſelf for that buſineſs, of which he was afterwards to become the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. The war breaking out in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the city of <hi>Ferrara</hi> being beſieged, he removed from thence to <hi>Mirandula,</hi> where he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the great <hi>Picus</hi> of that name, a prince of the brighteſt genius that age had produc'd, and one of the greateſt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the 45th year of his age, <hi>anno</hi> 1490, he began to prepare the neceſſary <hi>apparatus</hi> of a Printing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, wherein he ſpent <hi>four</hi> years, and conſequently did not begin Printing till about <hi>anno</hi> 1494. During this interval he obſerv'd with regret to what degree the abbreviations, us'd by all the former Printers every where, were multiply'd; ſo that they became unintelligible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome key to direct the reader, an inſtance of which is given in the margin <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <p>This curious example of the abbreviations, us'd in thoſe times, is extracted from <hi>Okam</hi>'s logick, folio verſo, leaf 121, as follows;</p>

                        <p>Theſe abbreviations were grown in time ſo numerous and univerſal, that books were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to be publiſh'd to teach the method of reading and underſtanding them.</p>
                     </note>. Upon this, he conſider'd a method to remedy this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0712300300:164"/>
and ſet them quite aſide in his editions. But becauſe the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words at length would enlarge the volumes a fourth part, (for there was ſcarce one word in five that was not abridg'd) and encreaſe the price; he reſolv'd likewiſe to remedy that. To which end he invented the <hi>Italick</hi> character, call'd from him <hi>Aldine,</hi> or <hi>Curſivus</hi> and <hi>Cancella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> from its reſemblance to hand-writing; which by-its figure and cloſeneſs, gain'd as much upon the round Roman, as the abbreviations did, and reduc'd the volume to near an exact bulk, thereby rendering them abſolutely uſeleſs. This is the main, tho' not the ſole advantage, which he propos'd by this new character; for the world has ſince found its extraordinary uſefulneſs in many other reſpects; which being obvious to every perſon, I ſhall not particulariſe here, but mention only the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of a mixture of Roman and Italick. However, it muſt be own'd, that <hi>Aldus</hi> made too great uſe of the latter, in printing whole volumes in that character, which is known to tire the eyes much more than the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Upon this account ſeveral emineat Printers afterwards rejected it in their quotations, when they were of any conſiderable length, and ſubſtituted Double comma's or Guillemets at one end of the lines, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the citations from the body of the book: which Guillemets were ſo call'd from their Inventor, a <hi>French</hi> Printer of that name.</p>

                  <p>'TIS apparent from the tenour of theſe briefs, that this Italick character was not the only particular, wherein <hi>Aldus</hi> ſignaliz'd himſelf; for the number and correctneſs of his editions, with the beauty of his characters, gain'd him the eſteem and admiration of the learned; nor need I tell the reader how highly all his works have been valued ever ſince, as well as thoſe of his ſon <hi>Paulus Manucius,</hi> of his ſon-in-law <hi>Andreas Azolanus,</hi> and his grandſon <hi>Aldus;</hi> which are of equal merit with his own, and of equal value. His ambition of being eſteem'd not only a man of letters, (as he really was,) but alſo the moſt correct Printer of the age, was ſuch, that he ſpar'd no coſt in procuring the beſt MSS, nor labour in reviſing them; and his care was ſo great, leſt any errors ſhould eſcape him either in the M S. or proofs, that, as we are aſſur'd by <hi>Angel.

However that be, his accuracy and diligence is unqueſtionably atteſted by all the learned; and he tells Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X, in his petition beforemention'd, that the height of his ambition was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the world with authors, corrected with the utmoſt exactneſs; and that nothing was more mortifying to him, than to ſee any faults in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>every one of which he would gladly, if poſſible, have redeem'd at the price of a crown of gold</hi> 
                     <note n="3" place="bottom">Sic doleo, ut, ſi poſſem, mutarem ſingula errata nummo aureo.</note>. What aſſiſtance he had from the learned in correcting his books may be gather'd from his preface to the <hi>Greek</hi> edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Logick,</hi> where he aſſures us, <hi>that he had ſome of the ableſt criticks with him, to aſſiſt in the correction;</hi> and in the preface to the <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks</hi> of that philoſopher, he boaſts, <hi>that his impreſſions were more perfect and correct than the very originals from which they were printed</hi>

                  <p>BUT it muſt be own'd that the learned are far from granting him this laſt piece of merit, which he challenges; and ſome of them have obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that he either printed them not according to the beſt manuſcripts, or corrected them by his own conjectures, or follow'd ſometimes too ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly thoſe which were faulty and imperfect. Upon this account <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> tho' a great friend of his, complains that <hi>Michael Bentius,</hi> who prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his proverbs, <hi>had follow'd the corrupt editions of</hi> Aldus <hi>in the quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from</hi> Homer <hi>and</hi> Cicero <note n="5" place="bottom">Nam <hi>Michael Bentius</hi> contulit quaedam loca a me citata ex Graeco <hi>Homero</hi> ab <hi>Aldo</hi> excuſo, item ex <hi>Cicerone Aldino.</hi> cum <hi>Aldina</hi> ſint depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatiſſima. <hi>Vita Eraſmi, Lugdun.

                     </note>, and lays the blame upon ſome <hi>Pedagogue, whom</hi> Aldus <hi>intruſted with the care of ſome of the editions of ancient authors.</hi> If this be fact, 'tis very much to be regretted, that ſo great a Printer, to whom the republick of learning is in all other reſpects ſo much oblig'd, ſhould be overſeen in a matter of ſuch importance. And this, in all probability, is the reaſon why he thus expreſſes his diſſatisfaction at his own editions, in the petition to the Pope beforemention'd; <note n="2" place="bottom">Sed ego non credulus illis; nullum enim adhuc dedi librum, in quo mihi ipſi ſatisfecerim.</note> 
                     <hi>that he was ſo far from regarding the flatteries of ſome perſons, that he had not as yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd one book, with which he could be ſatisfied</hi> 
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">Sed ego non credulus illis; nullum enim adhuc dedi librum, in quo mihi ipſi ſatisfecerim.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES this, he carries his complaints ſtill further, and inveighs loudly againſt two ſorts of men, who alone are capable of depriving the learned world of the benefit of printing, unleſs ſome ſpeedy ſtop be put to their wretched performances: the firſt are thoſe, who, notwithſtanding their notorious ignorance and incapacity, preſume to print any kind of books: the <hi>ſecond</hi> are the half learned editors, who not only venture upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ancient authors, but likewiſe write notes and commentaries with their own corrections upon them. Thus was this great man concern'd to ſee the corruptions already crept into the Art, thro' the avarice of ſome, and ignorance of others; whilſt himſelf found by ſad experience, that all his care, as well as learning, was ſcarce ſufficient for ſuch a taſk. As no Printer ever ſurpaſs'd him in the latter, ſo none ever equall'd him in the former; for ſo indefatigable was he in that laborious province, that he ſcarce allow'd himſelf time to eat, ſleep, or attend his domeſtick affairs; and, which is ſtill more, was ſo regardleſs of his health, as to neglect thoſe pleaſures and recreations ſo neceſſary and conducive to the preſervation of it. The learned <hi>Zuinger,</hi> in his <hi>Theatrum vitae humanae</hi> p. 3713 of the <hi>Baſil</hi> edition 1604, tells us, that his mind was entirely enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the care of his Printing-houſe; that, as ſoon as he had order'd his other neceſſary affairs, he ſhut himſelf up in his ſtudy, where he employ'd himſelf in reviſing his <hi>greek</hi> and <hi>latin</hi> manuſcripts, reading the letters which he receiv'd from the learned out of all parts of the world, and writing

anſwers to them. To prevent interruption by impertinent viſits, he caus'd the following inſcription to be plac'd over his cloſet door <note n="1" place="bottom">Quiſquis es, rogat te <hi>Aldus</hi> etiam atque eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ut ſiquid eſt quod a ſe velis, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ALDUS is affirm'd by many authors to have been the firſt who printed whole volumes in <hi>greek,</hi> particularly the learned <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> aſſerts, both in the <hi>Complaint of the Art of Printing</hi> written by him, and in his epitaph upon <hi>Aldus,</hi> that he was the firſt Printer in that language <note n="2" place="bottom">Qui graphicis primus tradidit illa typis.</note>; and <hi>Geſner</hi> tells <hi>Paul Manutius Aldus</hi>'s ſon, in the 11th book of his Pandects, that if he is not miſtaken, there were no <hi>greek</hi> books printed before thoſe of his father, or at leaſt, not with equal beauty and correctneſs with his <note n="3" place="bottom">Exemplaria Graeca ante patrem tuum aut nulla, ni <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

it to have been his firſt <hi>greek</hi> impreſſion; whereas he publiſh'd at leaſt <hi>three</hi> the year before. However 'tis plain he had printed no book in any language before <hi>anno</hi> 1494.</p>
                  <p>IT appears from what has been ſaid in a former chapter concerning the <hi>Lactantius</hi> printed in the monaſtery of <hi>Subiaco, anno</hi> 1465, the <hi>Gellius</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> 1469, and others, that ſeveral conſiderable fragments were printed in <hi>greek</hi> with no ſmall elegancy and correctneſs. But beſides theſe there were ſeveral editions in that language printed in divers cities of <hi>Italy</hi> ſome years before; the principal of which we ſhall mention.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>firſt,</hi> as yet known, is the <hi>greek</hi> grammar of <hi>Conſtantine Laſcaris</hi> 4to, revis'd by <hi>Demetrius Cretenſis,</hi> and printed by <hi>Dionyſius Palaviſinus</hi> at <hi>Milan, anno</hi> 1476, afterwards reprinted at <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Leonard</hi> of <hi>Baſil, anno</hi> 1488.</p>
                  <p>THE next is the <hi>greek</hi> pſalter printed at <hi>Venice, anno</hi> 1486 by <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Crete</hi> 4to, and <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Batrachomuomachia,</hi> or battle between the frogs and mice 4to, at <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Leonic</hi> of <hi>Crete</hi> in the ſame year. But as theſe may be eſteem'd only preludes or eſſays in that language, we ſhall come to a more conſiderable edition, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Homer</hi>'s works in <hi>greek,</hi> which <hi>B. Neril</hi> caus'd to be printed at <hi>Florence</hi> in a large <hi>folio, anno</hi> 1488 by <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> a native of <hi>Crete.</hi> This excellent work I have ſeen in the curious library of the learned Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> and I dare affirm that whoever examines the whiteneſs and ſtrength of the paper, the fineneſs of the character, the elegant diſpoſition of the matter, the exact diſtance between the lines, the large margin, and in ſhort, the whole performance with its various ornaments, will eaſily own it a maſter-piece in that kind. There was likewiſe a fine edition of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> printed at <hi>Milan</hi> in <hi>fol.</hi> by <hi>Henry German</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian ex Pontremulo, anno</hi> 1493, a year before any of <hi>Aldus</hi>'s impreſſions appear'd.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER, tho' he was not the firſt <hi>greek</hi> Printer, yet no perſon ever ſignaliz'd himſelf more in that province than he, nor equall'd him in beauty, correctneſs and number of editions. Concerning the beauty of his <hi>greek</hi> characters, of which he is ſaid to be the inventor, Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 237, <hi>Annal. Typogr.</hi> that thoſe, in which he printed the <hi>Pſalter, Aeſop, Ariſtotle, Ariſtophanes,</hi> &amp;c. were ſomewhat larger, rounder, more beautiful and elegant, adorn'd with frequent ligatures, which added no ſmall
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0712300300:170"/>
beauty to his <hi>greek</hi> editions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor is this is the only particular, for which the learned world is ſo much oblig'd to him; ſince his deſigns reach'd ſtill farther, and were anſwer'd to his great ſatisfaction before his death, which happen'd <hi>anno</hi> 1515. He obſerv'd, with no ſmall regret, how much and how long the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue had been neglected; in order therefore to revive that noble language, and accuſtom the learned by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to read nothing but the originals, he reſolv'd to publiſh moſt of his books in <hi>Greek</hi> only. This ſucceeded ſo well, that the oldeſt men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to acquaint themſelves with it, and as many youths engaged in the ſtudy of that tongue, as of the <hi>Latin;</hi> which gave him ſuch ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he mentions it in ſeveral of his prefaces, and particularly in that prefix'd to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Logic,</hi> wherein he thus expreſſes himſelf: <note n="1" place="bottom">Noſtris vero temporibus multos licet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>ALL his impreſſions were not of that nature; for in ſome of them, printed before and afterwards, as <hi>Muſaeus, Greek grammar, Proclus</hi>'s <hi>Sphaera,</hi> the works of <hi>Philoſtratus, Euſebius contra Hieroclem,</hi> &amp;c. he firſt gave the whole <hi>Greek</hi> text, and then the <hi>Latin</hi> tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>SOON after this, he invented a method, entirely new, of printing theſe <hi>Greek</hi> editions with their tranſlations, which I do not find practis'd by any Printer ſince.</p>

THEY were impos'd after ſuch a manner, that the purchaſer might have them bound either with the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> ſeparate, or with a leaf of the one, and a leaf of the other alternately; for inſtance, the <hi>firſt</hi> leaf was <hi>Greek,</hi> then follow'd the <hi>firſt</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> then the <hi>ſecond Greek</hi> leaf, and the <hi>ſecond Latin,</hi> and ſo on to the end; but with this precaution, that the <hi>Greek</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> leaf was only printed upon the <hi>ſecond</hi> page of it, and the <hi>Latin</hi> verſion oppoſite to it; the <hi>Latin</hi> upon the <hi>ſecond</hi> page of the <hi>Latin</hi> leaf was the verſion of the <hi>Greek</hi> upon the <hi>firſt</hi> page of the <hi>third</hi> leaf, and all the <hi>Greek</hi> upon the <hi>ſecond</hi> page of this leaf, fell exactly over againſt the <hi>Latin</hi> of it in the <hi>firſt</hi> page of the <hi>fourth</hi> or <hi>ſecond Latin</hi> leaf. This order being obſerv'd throughout, every other leaf being <hi>Greek,</hi> and the reſt <hi>Latin,</hi> it was eaſy either to bind it in two volumes, the one <hi>Greek,</hi> and the other <hi>Latin;</hi> or into one, with the original firſt, and verſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, oppoſite to each other.</p>
                  <p>BUT, as we remark'd before, this excellent method was never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, not even by thoſe, who reprinted ſuch of <hi>Aldus</hi>'s editions, as had been done after this way; <hi>viz. Eſop</hi>'s and <hi>Gabriel</hi>'s fables, <hi>Laſcaris</hi>'s gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they printed the <hi>Greek</hi> in one page, and the <hi>Latin</hi> upon the other; which is vaſtly more inconvenient than his method; the manner of printing both languages in two columns not being invented 'till after the year 1550, <hi>Vide Chevil.</hi> pag. 238. I conceive there is no neceſſity of giving a more particular deſcription of <hi>Aldus</hi>'s <hi>Greek</hi> types, becauſe his works are ſo univerſally known to the curious; but whoever deſires to know further concerning them, and their ſuperior excellence to thoſe us'd before, may conſult Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi>'s <hi>Annals,</hi> pag. 237.</p>
                  <p>ALDUS has been likewiſe ſuppos'd the firſt, or, at leaſt, one of the firſt, who printed in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But this is certainly a miſtake; for, tho' he had a font of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet he made but little uſe of it; and 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the jews of <hi>Soncino</hi> in the duchy of <hi>Milan</hi> began to print books in that language about <hi>twelve</hi> or <hi>fourteen</hi> years before <hi>Aldus</hi> appear'd, as ſhall be ſhewn in its proper place. <hi>Chevillier</hi> p. 267 tells us, that he ſaw nothing of his in this tongue, but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> alphabet, which is ſtill preſerv'd in the <hi>Sorbon</hi> library. We find however, that he wrote and printed an introduction to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue; as appears from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>BEFORE we cloſe the character of this great man, it will be proper to acquaint the reader with the reaſon of his aſſuming the name <hi>Pius</hi> after the year 1503; becauſe even this is another teſtimony of his merit. He receiv'd it from his patron prince <hi>Albertus Pius de Carpi,</hi> whoſe tutor he had formerly been, and who, on account of his ſingular deſert, adopted him into his family, and contributed large ſums towards defraying the charges of procuring and correcting manuſcripts, preparing three fonts, of <hi>Italick, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> characters, entertaining ſo many learned correctors, and ſuch a number of workmen, beſide the other charges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to every Printing-houſe. His chief correctors were <hi>Peter Alcyonius, Demetrius Chalcondylas, Marcus Muſurus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Bondinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE mark of his Printing-houſe, which ſhall be given, with the reſt of the marks or rebus's of the Printers of the 15th century, at the end of this book, was a dolphin twin'd about an anchor, and nibling at it; ſignifying his cloſe and indeſatigable application to buſineſs, which he went through with deliberation and judgment. <hi>Chevillier</hi> tells us, that he took it from the emperor <hi>Titus;</hi> and that <hi>Peter Bembus,</hi> who was afterwards made a cardinal, preſented him with a ſilver medal, which had that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's head on one ſide, and on the reverſe, a dolphin twiſting himſelf round an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

for himſelf with the greateſt ſincerity, that he had always thoſe two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with him, which they ſay are ſo neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> the dolphin and anchor, and publiſh'd many things with deliberation, and yet without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion.

                  <p>SOME vile Printers of <hi>Florence,</hi> finding the impoſſibility of equalling <hi>Aldus</hi>'s editions, reſolv'd to counterfeit them as well as his rebus, and carry'd on the cheat for ſome time, 'till it was diſcover'd by means of a miſtake committed by the engraver, who revers'd the dolphin, ſo that his head was on the left ſide of the anchor, whereas in <hi>Aldus</hi>'s mark it was on the right. Whether his ſon-in-law <hi>Andreas de Azola</hi> firſt perceiv'd this difference, I will not affirm; but he firſt gave publick notice of it, to prevent the world's being any longer impos'd upon.

                  <p>THE works, which we have of him, from 1494 to 1500, are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, twenty four; fourteen of which are <hi>Greek,</hi> and the reſt <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE reader may eaſily perceive, how ſhort this liſt comes of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which we might have reaſonably expected from ſo induſtrious a Printer, within the ſpace of ſix or ſeven years; eſpecially conſidering, that as himſelf aſſures us, he publiſh'd an author every month, which amounts to almoſt four times our number. Whether the reſt are periſh'd, or are ſtill latent in ſome libraries, I ſhall not determine, but am willing to hope the latter, and that time will by degrees bring them to light.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER he ſtill continued printing many years after the cloſe of the century, and took his father-in-law <hi>Andreas de Azola</hi> [in <hi>Latin Azola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0712300300:174"/>
in partnerſhip with him. As to the time of his death, or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it, I have not been able to diſcover any thing certain; I ſhall therefore conclude his hiſtory with a remark or two concerning an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, which I hope will not be diſagreeable to the reader: it is that of <hi>Poliphili hypnerotomachia,</hi> written by <hi>Franciſcus Columna,</hi> to prove that all the world is but a dream; wherein he relates many things worth learning: it has been ſuppos'd to be printed at <hi>Treviſo, anno</hi> 1467, becauſe at the end are the following words; <hi>Tarviſii cum decoriſſimis Poliae a more lorulis diſtineretur miſellus Poliphilus,</hi> MCCCCLXVII <hi>kalendis Maii, i. e.</hi> when the unfortunate <hi>Poliphilus</hi> was in love with the charming <hi>Polia,</hi> 1467.</p>
                  <p>THIS they thought to have been the year, when the book was printed; whereas <hi>Mattaire</hi> and <hi>Orlandi</hi> obſerve, that the words plainly demonſtrate it to be the year, in which <hi>Colonna</hi> finiſh'd it. Beſides, it is evident from the character, the regiſters, direction-words, comma's, interrogatory points, and other particularities, as well from the laſt leaf, which contains the errata, and concludes thus, <hi>Venetiis menſe Decembri</hi> MID <hi>in aedibus Aldi Manutii accuratiſſimé,</hi> that this edition came out from <hi>Aldus</hi>'s preſs. However, <hi>Orlandi</hi> tells us, that this leaf was deſignedly torn off, becauſe there is no date of the year, in which it was printed; but Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> gives us an account of theſe errata <hi>pag.</hi> 255, which bore this title, <hi>Gli er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rori del libro fatti ſtampando, liquali corrige coſi:</hi> then follows the errata containing fifty nine full lines, a greater number than <hi>Aldus</hi> ever put at the end of his works. After the errata are the <hi>Latin</hi> words abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, <hi>Venetiis,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis plain from this, that 1467 was the year, in which the author finiſh'd it at <hi>Treviſo,</hi> and the date of the edition, 1499. With reſpect to the author's name, <hi>Orlandi</hi> deduceth it from the initial letters of each chapter, which being joyn'd together form theſe words, <hi>Poliam frater Franciſcus Columna peramavit.

THESE two authors have chiefly confin'd their hiſtory to that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and, as they had all poſſible opportunities of ſearching the records and libraries of that univerſity, have been enabled to acquaint the world with a vaſt many particularities relating as well to the Art, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Printers there. But ſince an induction of them would ſwell this work to too great a bulk, I ſhall ſelect the moſt curious and material parts, and refer the reader for the reſt to the authors before mention'd. Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſons, I hope, are already given, againſt the opinion of thoſe, who, contrary to all the moſt inconteſtable records, aſſert that <hi>Nich. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> firſt brought printing to <hi>Paris.</hi> This particular is further confirm'd by the two laſt mention'd <hi>French</hi> hiſtorians, whoſe account of that matter is as follows.</p>
                  <p>SOME time before the year 1470, <hi>William Fichet</hi> and <hi>John Heynlim de Lapide</hi> or <hi>Lapidanus,</hi> two famous doctors of the univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the college of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> obſerving the progreſs of printing in ſeveral cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> began to uſe their utmoſt efforts in order to introduce it not only into that city, but even into their college, where they might give it all neceſſary help and encouragement. They were both perſons of great reputation for their learning and publick ſpirit. The former was a <hi>Savoyard</hi> by birth, and a great reſtorer of the long neglected art of rhetorick, and all polite literature. The latter was a <hi>German,</hi> and had been rector of the univerſity, and prior of the college of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> to which laſt dignity, he was choſen again about this time. As there were then but few, if any, except <hi>Germans,</hi> eminent in printing, <hi>Lapidanus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to bring ſome of the moſt ſkilfull thither. This could not but ſeem eaſily attainable by him, who had ſuch a numerous acquaintance amongſt the learned in <hi>Germany,</hi> and is ſuppos'd, upon good grounds, to have been of the ſame dioceſs, if not the ſame city with <hi>Uldric Gering,</hi> a native of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> The latter being influenc'd by the kind invitations of a perſon of ſuch eſteem, who promis'd him the college of <hi>Sorbon</hi> for his abode, and his aſſiſtance in procuring and preparing manuſcripts, and reviſing his editions; and allur'd by the hopes of conſiderable gain in ſo rich a city, wherein the Art was yet unpractis'd, brought two other countrymen with him, <hi>viz. Martin Crantz</hi> and <hi>Michael Friburger</hi> or <hi>de Columbaria</hi> or <hi>Colmar</hi> in <hi>Alſace,</hi> to <hi>Paris;</hi> where he ſet up preſſes in the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0712300300:178"/>
hall of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and in the year 1470 publiſh'd the firſt book, that ever was printed in any city of <hi>France,</hi> except that of <hi>Tours</hi> mention'd in a former chapter. Father <hi>Orlandi</hi> tells us, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XI gave <hi>Fitchet</hi> and <hi>Lapidanus</hi> orders to ſend for ſome of the beſt Printers to <hi>Paris,</hi> at his own charge; and that by this means the three <hi>German</hi> partners were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to ſettle there. <hi>Chevillier</hi> takes no notice of this, but attributes the honour wholly to the <hi>Sorboniſts.</hi> However, it is certain that this king was a great encourager of learning; as appears by the magnificent library which he form'd at his palace in <hi>Paris;</hi> whither he brought not only all the books, which his predeceſſors, and in particular <hi>Charles</hi> V ſirnam'd the wiſe, and <hi>Charles</hi> VI had collected and ſet up at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> but likewiſe all that he could purchaſe at any rate, together with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of editions printed at <hi>Mentz</hi> by <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer;</hi> and what manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts he could not purchaſe, he order'd to be curiouſly tranſcrib'd, and to be ſet up there. A remarkable inſtance of this, mention'd by the <hi>French</hi> writers, is as follows.</p>
                  <p>THE king underſtanding that the college of phyſicians at <hi>Paris</hi> had in their library the works of <hi>Rhaſis</hi> a phyſician, tranſlated out of <hi>Arabick</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> ſent to borrow it, in order to have it tranſcrib'd; but the college repreſenting it as againſt their conſtitutions to lend any of their books without a ſufficient pledge; his majeſty was contented to obtain the uſe of it, by depoſiting a large quantity of his own plate. Whether therefore the king or the two doctors brought the firſt Printers to <hi>Paris,</hi> 'tis beyond doubt, that he gave them ſufficient encouragement, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the library at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> with liberty to print from any of thoſe volumes, in the choice of which, it is probable, they were directed by their two patrons.</p>
                  <p>As the Art was then in its infancy at <hi>Paris,</hi> their firſt editions were in a large round Roman character but greatly inferior in beauty to that of their contemporaries in <hi>Italy;</hi> their paper was ſmooth and ſtrong, tho' leſs white; their impreſſions were maim'd and imperfect, with letters and words half printed, and finiſh'd with a pencil; the inſcription and title of ſome epiſtles, and the large initial letters of books and chapters were done with the hand, for which a blank was left in the page; they had no capitals, nor regular ſpaces, but were full of abbreviations; in ſhort,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0712300300:179"/>
there was nothing to recommend them except the newneſs, and the beauty of the ink. They us'd few rubricks, and thoſe only upon vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; ſome of their books begin at the <hi>folio verſo,</hi> or even page; and all of them are without titles, number of pages, ſignatures or direction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words; they us'd no ſignatures 'till the year 1476, and then plac'd them not at the bottom, but at the top of the pages; they added neither date, nor names of Printer and place; all which are only to be gathered from the prefaces, or epigrams at the end, or ſome other circumſtances, as will appear from the liſt of their works, eſpecially of thoſe printed in the three firſt years 1470, 1471, and 1472. It is certainly very ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that neither <hi>Gering</hi> nor his two learned patrons, who muſt infallibly have ſeen ſome of the <hi>Italian</hi> editions, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> which had all theſe neceſſary ornaments, ſhould not make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their deficiencies in all thoſe reſpects. However, ſo few were the elegant Printers in thoſe days, that the learned men of <hi>Paris,</hi> who eſteem'd the Art of more conſequence than theſe embelliſhments, fail'd not to acknowledge their obligation to the <hi>Sorbon</hi> doctors, for the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they had done to the univerſity in ſettling the Printers there, upon whom they were equally liberal of their encomiums. Enough of theſe may be ſeen in <hi>Chevillier</hi> pag. 41, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> I ſhall only cite in the margin an epigram printed at the end of <hi>Gaſpar Pergamenſis</hi>'s epiſtles, which was their firſt impreſſion, and had prefix'd to it a letter of thanks to thoſe great men, upon their bringing the Art to that city.</p>

                  <p>WE ſhall ſhew in the third book of this hiſtory, that the univerſity of <hi>Oxſord</hi> had the ſame authority over the Printers and bookſellers of that city.</p>
                  <p>TO return to our three Printers, they continued printing but three years at the houſe of the <hi>Sorbon;</hi> after which one of their patrons, <hi>Fichet</hi> being invited to <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV, and the other intending ſoon after to return to <hi>Germany,</hi> they remov'd to St. <hi>James's-ſtreet,</hi> at the ſign
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0712300300:181"/>
of the <hi>Golden Sun.</hi> Upon this they immediately rejected all their old punches, matrices and letters, and furniſh'd themſelves with ſome entirely new, and printed ſeveral conſiderable volumes 'till the year 1477; at which time <hi>Crantz</hi> and <hi>Friburger</hi> either return'd into <hi>Germany,</hi> or, at leaſt, left off printing, for there is no edition with their names after that year; but <hi>Gering</hi> printed in his own name many years longer, as ſhall be ſhewn in its place In the mean time, it will be proper to give the reader an account of this new ſet of characters, which they made uſe of in their new houſe.</p>
                  <p>'TIS to be obſerv'd, that they were of three or four ſorts, all different from each other, and from thoſe us'd at the houſe of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and caſt in new matrices. One ſort is vaſtly inferior to their former, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the hand-writing of that time, but ſuch as was done <hi>(ſtannea manu,</hi> as <hi>Aldus</hi> expreſſes it) with a heavy hand.</p>
                  <p>IT is not, however, altogether Gothic, but rather like that which <hi>Schoeffer</hi> us'd at <hi>Mentz.</hi> Another ſort was not unlike this in ſhape, but of a much larger face. The <hi>third</hi> was a Roman much more round and fine than the two former; but the <hi>fourth</hi> ſort, not us'd by <hi>Gering</hi> 'till after the year 1478, that is, after his partners had left him, is a very beautiful, large Roman, which (if we may believe <hi>Chevillier,</hi> who ſaw and compar'd them) is in no caſe inferior to that of the <hi>Spira</hi>'s, <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or any other of the famous <hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Printers, either before or ſince. Thus <hi>Gering</hi> attain'd to a degree of perfection equal with any of his brethren; but was at laſt oblig'd to comply with the cuſtom, and print ſeveral books in Gothic, ſuch as <hi>Virgil</hi> and ſome others, beſides thoſe for the uſe of churches. The editions printed at this houſe, and in theſe new characters, are ſtill defective with reſpect to their dates or Printers names, ſome wanting the one, ſome the other, and ſome both, as appears by the liſt of his works given us by the foremention'd author, <hi>anno</hi> 1480. <hi>Gering</hi> took into partnerſhip with him for ſome time, <hi>William Maynyal;</hi> and in the year 1483 remov'd from St. <hi>James's-ſtreet,</hi> and took a leaſe, during life, of a houſe belonging to the college of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> where he ſet up his old ſign of the <hi>Golden-ſun.</hi> As he was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very rich, and had contracted an intimate friendſhip with the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> collegians, he made them ſome conſiderable donatives both in books
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0712300300:182"/>
and money; upon which account they choſe him fellow of that college, and aſſign'd him chambers and commons in it: and as he was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in matrimony, he took the more pleaſure in converſing with them, communicating his deſigns, and uſing their advice about the books which he was to print, and their aſſiſtance in correcting them; in return for which he preſented them with copies of all his editions. It was no ſmall advantage to that college (which was call'd at firſt by the founder <hi>Robert Sorbon, Societas pauperum magiſtrorum Pariſiis in theologica facultate ſtudentium)</hi> to have ſo generous a friend and benefactor admitted into it; who requited them for this honour with vaſt legacies, left by him in his will to this college, and that of <hi>Montague</hi> in the ſame city. For by his ſucceſs in printing 'till <hi>anno</hi> 1510, in which he died, he had amaſs'd a prodigious quantity of wealth, all which he bequeath'd to thoſe two colleges. What he endow'd the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in particular with, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintain <hi>eight</hi> fellows, to be added to thoſe on the old foundation, and two lectures every day, one in the morning for the Old, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the afternoon for the New Teſtament; beſides ſeveral other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives to thoſe of the houſe whom he had a particular eſteem for.</p>
                  <p>Now conſidering, that he was the firſt Printer of that city and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that he was invited thither by the college of <hi>Sorbon;</hi> that he had been ſo great a maſter of his art, and ſo liberal to that poor ſociety in his life-time, and after his death; the reader may perhaps expect to hear of ſome monument erected by them to his memory: but 'tis plain from what <hi>Chevillier,</hi> a fellow of that college, tells us, that they did not ſo much as ſet a grave-ſtone over him, to let the world know where that great man was bury'd; ſo that our laſt mention'd author, after a vaſt deal of pains, could not gain the leaſt certainty about it. However, to do them juſtice, they order'd an anniverſary-maſs to be ſaid on the 23d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on which he dy'd. Who his correctors were, is difficult to determine; but it is probable he made uſe of any of the collegians, whom he pleas'd. He had ſome other partners beſides <hi>Maynyal</hi> beforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and inſtructed ſeveral Printers, who ſignaliz'd themſelves both du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life and after he dy'd. There were likewiſe divers other Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes ſet up at <hi>Paris</hi> ſoon after his, of which we ſhall ſpeak, when we have given ſome further account of his works; <hi>Chevillier</hi> in his liſt of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0712300300:183"/>
them divides them into three claſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which he printed with his two partners in the college from 1470 to 1473; next thoſe printed at the <hi>Golden Sun</hi> in St. <hi>James's-ſtreet</hi> 'till <hi>anno</hi> 1483; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> thoſe which he printed from that time 'till his death, either by himſelf or with his other partners.

                     <p>THESE two Printers were likewiſe natives of <hi>Germany,</hi> but had already ſtudied ſometime in the univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> where the former had attain'd to the degree of maſter of arts: theſe two became acquainted with their countryman <hi>Gering,</hi> and inform'd him of their deſign of ſetting up a Printing-houſe, begging his aſſiſtance and inſtructions therein, which he readily granted: and thus was the ſecond Preſs ſet up at <hi>Paris</hi> by theſe two learned perſons, who became ſoon after, no leſs famous, for their induſtry and application, than they had been for their learning. They pitch'd upon one of the houſes, belonging to the college of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> to print in, which <hi>Chevillier</hi> tells us, was in St. <hi>James's-ſtreet</hi> at the ſign of the <hi>Soldier</hi> and <hi>Swan:</hi> their character was ſhort of the beauty of <hi>Uldric Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> tho' far from being of the Gothic kind; this may be one reaſon why a great many of their works are loſt: they were likewiſe guilty of neglecting to affix either their names or dates to their works: ſo that the former is only to be gather'd from the likeneſs of the character to their

                     <p>HE was one of the moſt conſiderable Printers and bookſellers of his time, and very eminent for the curioſity and number of his ditions. The greateſt part of his books conſiſt in romances and the like, printed in a Gothic character, but ſo elegant as to pleaſe the eve extremely. Many of them are printed upon fine vellum; <hi>La Caille</hi> tells us, that there are above an hundred volumes of his romances printed curiouſly on vellum, embelliſh'd with exquiſite miniatures or ſmall cutts, painted in water colours, in imitation of the manuſcripts which he printed after, all which are to be ſeen in the French king's library. However, tho' he engag'd moſt in romantick pieces, yet he likewiſe publiſh'd ſeveral learned vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, all in <hi>French,</hi> with equal care and beauty, in the ſame Gothic letter.</p>
                     <p>HE kept his Printing-houſe and ſhop upon the bridge of <hi>Nôtre Dame</hi> at the ſign of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi> Sometimes he ſubſcribes his books only with the firſt letters of his name, A.

                     <p>JOHN PETIT was a native of <hi>Paris,</hi> and rather a bookſeller than a Printer: he is juſtly eſteem'd one of the moſt eminent and induſtrious ones of his time. He kept the greateſt number of the beſt workmen of any of his contemporaries, with no leſs than fifteen preſſes continually at work at his own charges, whilſt himſelf was engag'd in the buſineſs of his ſhop, at the <hi>ſilver Lyon,</hi> and procuring the moſt ſkilfull correctors to reviſe his works. He gain'd a prodigious reputation by the beauty and correctneſs of his impreſſions, which, tho' printed in a Gothic character, are much eſteem'd by the curious. He began to print <hi>anno</hi> 1498, tho' ſome copies
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0712300300:187"/>
of editions by ſeveral former Printers have likewiſe his name, as Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire</hi> informs us, yet all have not; he continued printing 'till <hi>anno</hi> 1532, and many of his impreſſions are as ſcarce as they are curious. The learned <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> father of ſo many great Printers of that name, was ſo well ſatisfy'd of his merit, that he was glad to have him for his partner with <hi>Wolfgang Hopyl</hi> mention'd above, who was a Printer of much older date: <hi>Petit</hi> became ſo famous, both for the beauty and correctneſs, as well as the number of his editions, that he was afterwards ſworn Printer and bookſeller to the univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and choſen ſyndic or maſter of that company; among thoſe Printers which he employ'd, was the famous <hi>Jodocus Badius,</hi> who printed ſeveral conſiderable editions for him. In the title page of his books, he us'd the words <hi>Petit a Petit [by little and little]</hi> alluding to his own name, which he alſo us'd for his motto. The books which we finde printed in his name from 1498 to 1500, are only three, the firſt of which is much valued by ſtudents in law, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this chapter, I cannot omit obſerving, that <hi>Paris</hi> hath been a noble patroneſs of the Art of Printing. 'Tis true, <hi>Venice</hi> is juſtly fam'd upon this account; yet it ought to be remember'd, that moſt of her celebrated Printers were of the <hi>French</hi> nation, and ſignaliz'd themſelves as much in this Art, as any other nation; and that <hi>Paris</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd all other cities of that kingdom in this reſpect. The encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which their kings, and the learned of that and other countries, have given the Art, and the care of the univerſity over the Printers, have
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0712300300:188"/>
contributed extremely to the great improvements made therein. Beſides this, the <hi>French</hi> have ſhewn an extraordinary genius and ſkill in the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their punches for all languages; they have been very curious about their paper, and more particularly in adorning their editions with cutts, head and tail pieces, initial letters, rubricks and other embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that nature. This I mention not ſo much with reſpect to the 15th century, as to the following. No city has produc'd a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the fineſt bibles than <hi>Paris.</hi> Their large, royal and polyglot bibles are juſtly eſteem'd maſter-pieces of that kind; their editions of general and provincial councils, of canon and civil-law, the works of the fathers, chronological and hiſtorical books, and, in ſhort, in every art and ſcience, are very numerous, rich, and valuable; and many of them contain ſeven, eight, and ten large volumes, and ſome twenty, thirty, and even thirty ſeven, as the acts of the council printed by the famous <hi>Anthony Vitré</hi> at the <hi>Louvre.</hi> The women likewiſe were very eminent in this province; and particularly, <hi>Charlotte Guillard,</hi> the widow of <hi>Berthold Rembolt, Ulric Gering</hi>'s partner, who for the ſpace of 50 years kept ſeveral preſſes, and printed a great number of large and correct editions both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> her beſt editions were publiſh'd after ſhe became a widow the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, <hi>viz.</hi> the bible, the fathers; in particular, the works of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in two volumes were printed ſo accurately, that the <hi>errata</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd but three faults. Her fame at laſt increas'd ſo, that the learned <hi>Lewis Lippoman,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Verona,</hi> made choice of her to print his <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na SS. patrum in Geneſim,</hi> which he finiſh'd in <hi>Portugal.</hi> This edition ſhe perform'd ſo much to his ſatisfaction, that when he aſſiſted at the council of <hi>Trent,</hi> he came on purpoſe to <hi>Paris</hi> to return her thanks, and prevail'd upon her to print likewiſe his ſecond volume, <hi>viz. Catena in Exodum,</hi> which ſhe perform'd with equal beauty and correctneſs. Theſe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other particulars relating to that admirable woman, may be ſeen in <hi>Chevil.</hi> p. 48, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Paris</hi> has always abounded in excellent Printers, and furniſh'd moſt other cities of <hi>Europe</hi> with ſome of them; ſo, on the other hand, it muſt be own'd, that it has produc'd ſeveral equally bad, who have publiſh'd many wretched editions; and 'tis probable they might have ſtill increas'd, had not the univerſity check'd their growth. For as it has ſuch power
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0712300300:189"/>
over all Printers and bookſellers, as to refuſe admitting thoſe into the buſineſs, who are not ſufficiently qualify'd, and to turn them out of it, or ſuſpend or fine them for any miſdemeanors, as was hinted before; it can more eaſily reſtrain them, than where ſuch checks are wanting. However thoſe, whoſe merit recommends them, enjoy all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they can reaſonably deſire, both from their princes and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. They are endow'd with privileges, exemptions, and immunities beyond any other city; and have had frequent opportunities of raiſing themſelves to great dignities, of acquiring large eſtates, and in ſhort, every thing ſuitable to their merit.</p>

                        </gap>d the Art of Printing very early. We have taken notice, in the firſt book of this hiſtory, that ſome of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s ſervants left him even before the taking of that city, and ſettled at <hi>Cologn;</hi> and the author of the Chronicle of that name mentions it as the firſt city, which receiv'd the art after <hi>Mentz.</hi> 'Tis unqueſtionable that if her firſt impreſſions had been preſerv'd, we muſt have given it the precedency to almoſt all the cities hitherto mention'd; but whether the firſt printers of it neglected to add their own, and the cities name at the end of their editions, (a fault too common in thoſe days) or whether their works were too inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be preſerv'd; it is certain that there is no book, as yet known, printed there with an authentick date, before this year 1470; which is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0712300300:190"/>
the reaſon why, according to our propos'd method, we can allow it no higher rank. We have indeed, in the introduction to this ſecond book, taken notice of one of the moſt eminent printers in this city, <hi>viz.

                     <p>MILAN [in <hi>latin Mediolanum]</hi> is one of the four chief cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſituate near the rivers <hi>Adda</hi> and <hi>Teſino,</hi> and ſaid to have been built by the <hi>Trojans</hi> after their expulſion by <hi>Bellover</hi> king of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> This city, after a variety of chances and wars, was almoſt ruined by <hi>Frederic Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa;</hi> but now flouriſhes under the emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi> It received the Art of Printing very early, and had many excellent artificers from the beginning, whoſe works are equally valuable with thoſe of any other cities We cannot poſitively affirm any thing concerning the time, in which this Art was brought hither, nor who were the men that ſet it up. The firſt both in time as well as excellency was.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. ANTHONY ZAROT, 1470.</p>
                     <p>HE was a native of the city of <hi>Parma,</hi> tho' of <hi>Cretenſian</hi> parents, as appears by ſome of his colophons, and gain'd a great reputation for 30 years, in which he continued printing, by his elegant and correct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in a beautiful Roman character, which are ſufficiently known among the learned. He was oblig'd indeed to comply with the cuſtom in printing ſome editions in old Gothic; yet even th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe have all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and beauty they can admit of. He is eſteem'd the inventor of ſignatures, or alphabetical letters at the bottom of every ſheet, which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0712300300:192"/>
at firſt he plac'd under the laſt line of the page, where they ought to be: But afterwards he put them, upon what account is hard to gueſs, at the end of the laſt line, ſo as to make them ſerve, as it were, for the laſt word in the page. This appears by his edition of <hi>John Simoneta de geſtis Franciſci Sfortiae ducis Mediol.</hi> anno 1486. This whim of his was not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by any Printer, nor by himſelf long; for he ſoon return'd to the firſt method. His main province was printing of claſſicks, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with extraordinary diligence and accuracy. He is ſaid to be the firſt that printed miſſals or maſs-books for the uſe of the clergy, who were hitherto us'd to MS ones. That which he printed <hi>anno</hi> 1478, had the four <hi>Latin</hi> verſes in red letters, which you will find in the margin <note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <p>IT was the native place of <hi>John Guttenbergh,</hi> to which, after his diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with <hi>Fauſt,</hi> he brought the Art of Printing together with ſome of his artificers; ſo that it may be juſtly eſteem'd, at leaſt, one of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0712300300:195"/>
firſt cities, that practis'd it after <hi>Mentz,</hi> tho' all the monuments of it are ſo far loſt to us, that we know not any books with a certain date, printed there before the year 1471.</p>
                     <p>WE have ſeen, in the firſt part of this hiſtory, how much this city hath been celebrated by ſome authors, upon the account of <hi>John Guttenbergh,</hi> whom they ſuppos'd to have been the inventor of this Art, or at leaſt to have laid the firſt foundation of it here, tho' he was oblig'd to retire to <hi>Mentz</hi> in order to perfect it. But as this, I conceive, has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted already, it is unneceſſary to repeat it here. I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe given the reader an account of another controverfy in favour of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> and <hi>John Mentel</hi> ſtarted about two hundred years after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this Art, by Dr. <hi>Mentel</hi> of the univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> who aſſerted that his anceſtor was the Inventor of Printing; which diſcovery he was robb'd of by a treacherous ſervant, whom he ſuſpects to be our famous <hi>John Fauſt.</hi> I hope, I have fully expoſed the vanity of this author's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and his unfaithfulneſs in quoting teſtimonies in behalf of <hi>Mentel;</hi> againſt whom, were there no other evidence, it would be ſufficient to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that there is not one book printed in his name before the year 147<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and that without any mention of the city of <hi>Strasburgh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALL that is proper to add at preſent is, that our author, to elude, if poſſible, the force of this objection, affirm'd that this book, which <hi>John Mentel</hi> finiſh'd <hi>anno</hi> 1473, was no leſs than twenty years a printing, and contain'd ten large volumes in <hi>fol.</hi> ſo that it muſt have been begun about 1453, <hi>i. e.</hi> four years before <hi>Fauſt</hi> had printed any work in his name, but this is a groundleſs conjecture.</p>
                     <p>THIS book is the <hi>Speculum Morale</hi> of <hi>Vincentius Belvacenſis,</hi> a very voluminous work; but that it ſhould have taken up 20 years in printing, is only ſaid without any authority or teſtimony for it; however we may allow it to have taken up ſome conſiderable time, without leſſening the validity of what has been heretofore affirm'd after ſeveral eminent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> at his return from <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had been ſelling his printed bibles for manuſcripts, ſtay'd ſome time at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> where he taught <hi>Mentel</hi> his Art. The only difficulty againſt it is, that if thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> laſt had been let into the ſecret ſo ſoon, there would be ſome ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and a greater number of his productions to be ſeen. The former is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0712300300:196"/>
eaſily anſwer'd by the ſad experience we have, of too many of the old monuments of the Art being either loſt, or not yet diſcover'd; and the latter, <hi>De la Caille</hi> endeavours to account for, who peremptorily aſſerts this <hi>Mentel</hi> to be the ſame with <hi>John Mentelen</hi> or <hi>Manthen de Geretzſheim,</hi> who went and ſettled at <hi>Venice,</hi> and aſſociated himſelf with the famous <hi>John de Cologne,</hi> one of the moſt eminent and firſt Printers of that city about the year 1474, with whom he printed ſeveral valuable editions, mention'd in the chapter of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IF this aſſertion be well grounded, 'tis ſuperfluous to ſeek for any of his works at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> except the <hi>Speculum</hi> beforemention'd, if even that was printed there. But as <hi>la Caille</hi> has not mention'd his authority, I ſhall not dare to aſſert the truth of this too poſitively. We muſt not omit taking notice, that this <hi>John Manthen</hi> continued printing at <hi>Venice,</hi> with his partner aforeſaid, 'till the year 1480, as the reader may ſee by what has been ſaid of him there; whereas <hi>John Mentel</hi> is affirm'd by the Dr. from the authority of <hi>Gaſpar Benegerus</hi> to have dy'd at <hi>Strasburgh</hi> two years before, <hi>viz.</hi> 1478, in honour of whom the great bell of that city was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to be rung the ſunday following <note n="1" place="bottom">Obiit dominus <hi>Johannes Mentel</hi> ſabatho poſt conceptionem virginis <hi>Moriae, an o</hi> MCCCC LXX IIX; et factus eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>BOLOGNA or <hi>Bolonia,</hi> in <hi>Latin Bononia,</hi> an ancient and famous city of <hi>Italy,</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> upon the river <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the territories of the pope, was formerly call'd <hi>Felſina,</hi> from <hi>Felſinus</hi> king of the <hi>Thuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> which ſignifies a ſhield. This name ſhe preſerv'd above nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and always was eminent for the number of learned men and brave warriers which ſhe produc'd. This city afterwards was call'd <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jona</hi> from <hi>Buoi</hi> king of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and in proceſs of time <hi>Bononia</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia.</hi> It is at this day a celebrated univerſity, endow'd with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary privileges from emperors, popes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch a concourſe of ſtudents reſort thither, that it is recorded of one of their doctors and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, the learned <hi>Azzo,</hi> that he was oblig'd to read his lectures in ſome publick market places, to above ten thouſand ſtudents. For theſe and other reaſons, not neceſſary to be given here, it has been ſtyl'd <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymnaſium mundi,</hi> and the mother and founder of univerſities

 <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0712300300:199"/>
 and correct, ſo he hath taken care to tell the world of it in almoſt every colophon at the end of his books, by adding ſome pompous title to his name, ſuch as <hi>impreſſor ſolertiſſimus, artis hujus exactor probatiſſimus, quam pulcherrimis Characteribus,</hi> &amp;c. He is thought to have either learn'd the Art at <hi>Venice,</hi> or furniſh'd himſelf with his Fonts from thence. The firſt is moſt probable, becauſe we find an edition of <hi>Dion. Chryſoſtom's Oratio de regno,</hi> 4to. ſuppos'd to have been printed by him at <hi>Venice anno</hi> 1483. But <hi>F. Orlandi</hi> thinks this ſuppoſition ill-grounded, and therefore hath mention'd neither him, nor that edition under the article of <hi>Venice,</hi> but has put it at the head of thoſe printed by him at <hi>Bologna,</hi> where having found a book, printed <hi>anno</hi> 1481, intitled <hi>Baptiſtae Mantuani Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melitani parthenices,</hi> he reprinted it with his own name and colophon.

He was an excellent Printer, and a rival of the famous <hi>Plato de Benedictis,</hi> whom he endeavour'd to ſurpaſs in beauty of letter, fineſs and accuracy of his impreſſions, which tho' they do not excel, yet are not at all inferior to thoſe of his corrival, and he doth not fail accordingly to give himſelf ſome of theſe pompous epithets which we have ſeen of the other; and it is obſerv'd that ſome of <hi>Plato's</hi> impreſſions were no ſooner come out of the preſs, but <hi>Bacilierus</hi> went immediately to work upon them, and publiſh'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

                        <hi>Article.</hi> I. <hi>The City of</hi> NAPLES.</head>
                     <p>NAPLES, in <hi>Latin Neapolis</hi> and <hi>Parthenope,</hi> is the metropolis of the kingdom of that name, in <hi>Italy.</hi> It was formerly govern'd by kings of its own, but afterwards became ſubject to the crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0712300300:203"/>
now under the emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi> This city has been the reſidence of men of the moſt diſtinguiſh'd wit and learning, in ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ages; as <hi>Virgil,</hi> who is ſaid to have writ his Georgicks here; <hi>Livy, Horace, Claudian, Petrarck, Bocatellus Panormitanus, Laurentius Valla,</hi> the great reſtorer of latinity and eloquence; <hi>Perillus,</hi> an elegant <hi>Italian</hi> poet; and many others of conſpicuous merit. The great number of learned men in this city, particularly, when printing became known and ſpread itſelf over <hi>Europe,</hi> was a ſufficient inducement for ſome of the beſt Printers to ſettle there. But none encourag'd the Art and artiſts more, than <hi>Ferdinand</hi> III. king of <hi>Naples,</hi> whom we had occaſion to mention before, upon the account of the free acceſs, which the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had to his perſon, and their epiſtolary correſpondence with him, and who liv'd at the time of the infancy of the Art. As his learning was equal to the eſteem he had for the learned, I doubt not but it was he who procur'd the famous <hi>Sixtus Ruſſinger</hi> a learned and pious prieſt, who was a native of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> to ſettle in his capital. This ſeems more than probable, not only becauſe he was the firſt who ſet up a preſs at <hi>Naples,</hi> but from the great marks of eſteem which that prince ſhew'd him; inſomuch, that having diſcover'd his intention to return to his own country, he try'd all poſſible means to divert him from it, and even offer'd him a noble biſhoprick, or any other preferment, if that could have fix'd him in his dominions. But this venerable old man, whether out of modeſty, or rather a deſire of ſpending the ſmall remainder of his days in his native city, refus'd the king's offer, and return'd home loaden with the preſents of that generous monarch. <hi>Rieſſinger</hi> was not only a Printer, but a clergyman, and famous for his great learning; yet as he continued but a ſhort time at <hi>Naples,</hi> we have few editions of his. <hi>Orlandi</hi> gives him a contemporary and fellow citizen, <hi>viz. Peter</hi> of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> who ſettled there about the ſame year; but as I do not find that he printed any thing in company with <hi>Rieſſinger,</hi> or that any of his impreſſions are left, I ſhall ſay no more of him.</p>
                     <p>WE have but four impreſſions of <hi>Sixtus Ruſſinger,</hi> or <hi>Rieſſinger,</hi> two dated <hi>anno</hi> 1471 and 1472, the other two without date. They are all curious and correct, and two of them have <hi>Latin</hi> epigrams at the end
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0712300300:204"/>
in his commendation. We don't find that he carried on the buſineſs after he came again to his native place.</p>

We do not find that he went to any other city in order to learn it, but being a conſiderable gold-ſmith, and having two ſons, <hi>viz. Dominic</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who were very ingenious artificers, and the latter a perſon of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they ſet themſelves about cutting of punches, ſinking of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and, in ſhort, got the whole apparatus of a Printing-houſe made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their houſe; inſomuch that they were in a capacity of printing before the year 1471. The firſt book and only one we have left, which is the reaſon why he has been unknown to all our annaliſts till <hi>F.

                        <hi>Article</hi> I. <hi>The City of</hi> NUREMBERGH, 1472.</head>
                     <p>NUREMBERGH or <hi>Norimbergh,</hi> in <hi>Latin Norimberga,</hi> is a free city in <hi>Germany</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Swabia, Franconia,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſituate upon the river <hi>Pegnitz.</hi> It was formerly a democratical commonwealth, but upon ſome domeſtick ſedition, it reduc'd itſelf to an ariſtocracy, in the reign of the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> IV, under the government of twenty four ſenators choſen out of ſo many of their ancienteſt families; which form of government hath been continued ever ſince. The city is very rich, large and populous, ſurrounded with a double wall above eight miles in circuit, and 180 lofty towers. It was always celebrated for producing the beſt artificers in every kind of handicraft, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a beautiful metal of their own making, call'd <hi>Nurembergh</hi> copper; the compoſition of which was kept with all imaginable ſecrecy within their walls, every workman being firſt ſworn to it; ſo that the metal was almoſt equally dear with ſilver; till about the latter end of the laſt century, one of their own citizens came over and ſold the ſecret here in <hi>England,</hi> which has made it more common, and conſequently leſſen'd the price of it. This metal I purpoſely chuſe to mention becauſe it was reckon'd very excellent for making of matrices, being far more ductile than the common copper, and not ſo apt to break the punches.</p>
                     <p>IT will be no eaſy matter to fix the time when the Art of Printing was brought to this city. <hi>John Andreas Endlers</hi> a Printer of <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> who publiſh'd a piece on Printing, in <hi>High Dutch, anno</hi> 1722, and in it has given us an account of its progreſs in that city, acquaints us that he had met with ſome MS. annals, which affirm, that the Art was no ſooner found out at <hi>Mentz,</hi> but it was immediately communicated to <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> which did therefore receive it about the year 1444 accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one, or 1440 according to another. 'Tis true, our author is ſo far from being ſatisfy'd with their account, that he has even taken the pains to confute them from more authentic teſtimonies; however, tho'
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0712300300:211"/>
I do not deſign to enter into a detail of that diſpute, yet I could not forbear mentioning thus much, becauſe it ſerves to confirm a former obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> that not only the Printers, but likewiſe the <hi>Cities</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have taken no ſmall pains to antedate their reſpective claims to this Art.</p>
                     <p>I have already taken notice in the firſt part of this hiſtory, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. that the diſcovery of the Art of Printing had been attributed by <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach,</hi> and <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> to that learned mathematician and aſtronomer <hi>John de Monte regio,</hi> or <hi>Regio-Montanus,</hi> and mention'd <hi>Manilius</hi>'s aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my printed by him without date or places name. Our <hi>German</hi> author acquaints us upon the authority of <hi>Gaſſendi,</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> royal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> came to <hi>Nuremberg</hi> about <hi>anno</hi> 1471, with a deſign to ſet up a Printing-houſe there, in order to print his own works and thoſe of other learned men, with greater accuracy and ſpeed, and to improve the Art of Printing in ſeveral of its branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but that he met with ſo many obſtacles to his deſign, that he ſaw himſelf forc'd to make uſe of foreign Printing-houſes, ſuch as they were, till one <hi>Bernard Walter</hi> offer'd to bear the charges of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Printing-houſe for him (as he likewiſe did towards many other curious inventions of his) and enabled him to print <hi>Purbac</hi>'s new theory, <hi>Manilius</hi>'s aſtronomy, and his own <hi>Ephemerides</hi> for the uſe of the publick."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>OUR author obſerves further, that as this account of <hi>Gaſſendi</hi>'s doth quite overturn <hi>Peter Ramus</hi>'s ſuppoſition of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> being the inventor of the art, ſo it likewiſe ſhews him to have contributed much towards the improvement of it. It likewiſe proves that there were ſome Preſſes in this city before he came thither, but who they were that ſet them up, and what works they printed before that time, is what he has not been able to find out, becauſe they have no dates or Printer's names.</p>
                     <p>THE oldeſt book he could find with a date, is the <hi>Commeſtorium Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum</hi> of <hi>Francis de Retza</hi> a <hi>Dominican Fryar;</hi> at the end of which are the words which you'll find in the margin <note n="1" place="bottom">Hic Codex egregius Comeſtorii vitiorum ſacre Theologie Profeſſoris eximii <hi>Franciſci</hi> de <hi>Retza</hi> Ordinis predicatorum finit feliciter. <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberge anno</hi>

which our author ſeems to take for 1470. This book was afterwards reprinted by <hi>Ant. Koburger anno</hi> 1476, and afterwards <hi>anno</hi> 1496, under the following title, <hi>Summa quae deſtructorium vitiorum nominatur,</hi> without Printer's name.</p>
                     <p>The author mentions another book of the ſame date, <hi>viz.

                        <p>A perſon eminent for learning, and the number, elegancy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectneſs of his editions, which gain'd him the title of the prince of Printers among the learned of his time. At firſt indeed his character, tho' of the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſort, was ſomewhat imperfect, and inferior to that of many of his cotemporaries; but he afterwards procur'd a new ſett, which hath been juſtly eſteem'd ever ſince as fine as any that have been us'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or after him. He was no leſs ſolicitous in correcting his works; ſo that tho' he was alone ſufficient for that task, yet he took the learned <hi>Frederic Piſtorius</hi> for his aſſiſtant. He ſpar'd no coſt nor pains in procuring the beſt manuſcripts, and always deſir'd the judgment of the learned before he ventur'd to print them. The great <hi>Jodocus Badius</hi> hath made this ſhort but juſt panegyric upon him, in a letter written to him <hi>anno</hi> 1499, and printed at the beginning of the works of <hi>Angelus Politianus anno</hi> 1519 <note n="1" place="bottom">Litteratos omnes &amp; colis &amp; foves, pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilemque curam ad bonos codices vere terſe &amp; ſine mendis imprimendos adhibes.</note>; That he was a great friend and lover of the learned, and indefatigable in printing the beſt copies faithfully, neatly and correctly. Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> hath given us an extract of this letter in his <hi>Annales Typogr.</hi> p. 79. by which the reader may ſee what eſteem this great man was in, not only among the learned, but likewiſe among the beſt Printers of his time; and it may be ſaid of him, that he printed more works than any of them, particularly bibles, of which the reader
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0712300300:213"/>
will find no leſs than 12 editions ſtill extant, one of which is in 5, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in 6 volumes in folio, and a third with fine wooden cuts.</p>
                        <p>HE was no leſs diligent in printing other works, and we are told by <hi>John And. Endters,</hi> 
                           <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he kept daily twenty four preſſes at work, and employ'd no leſs than an hundred journeymen whom he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd without doors; they had a ſet hour to come to work, and to leave off, and he admitted none ſingle into his houſe but oblig'd them to wait at his door till they were altogether, and then they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in, and enter'd upon their reſpective works.
<p>HE was likewiſe a conſiderable Bookſeller, and kept a ſpacious printing-houſe at <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he had ſundry law-books printed for him; beſides this, he had his factors and agents in the moſt conſiderable cities in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and kept ſixteen open ſhops beſide ware-houſes, and in all of them a conſiderable ſtock of the beſt books then extant, ſo that he never was at a loſs for any good edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſupply his cuſtomers with."</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>THUS he continued printing both at <hi>Nuremberg</hi> and at <hi>Lyons</hi> with great ſucceſs and applauſe, till the year 1501 if not beyond; however we don't find any edition of his of a more recent date, which makes me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he left off printing about that time. In 1513. <hi>James Sachon</hi> one of his workmen at <hi>Lyons,</hi> printed <hi>Caſtellanus</hi>'s <hi>Latin</hi> bible for him with this colophon, <hi>Lugduni per Jacobum Sachon expenſis Antonii Kobur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> The ſame is likewiſe dated from <hi>Nurembergh,</hi> but is ſuppos'd to be the ſame edition with that of <hi>Lyons;</hi> he dy'd in this year after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been for ſome time a member of the chief council of <hi>Nuremberg;</hi> all the editions that we have of him, his bibles incluſive, from 1472 to 1500, amounts to but thirty ſeven, a number too inconſiderable for the many preſſes and workmen that he kept, which gives me room to hope that time will diſcover a great many more.</p>

very beautiful, nor do I doubt but that his genius for painting and engraving, led him to the other two branches of cutting upon wood and Printing, that he might be able to perform the whole work himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the danger of having any part of it ſpoil'd by unſkilful hands, and the better to print the deſcriptions of his cuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a more elegant manner than cou'd poſſibly be done in wood. His improvement in the art of engraving or cutting upon wood, was carried by him to its utmoſt perfection, as all perſons muſt own who have ſeen any of his works.</p>
                        <p>The part of ſhadowing which is call'd croſs-hatching, and which has been loſt for many years, and conducted (if not wholly invented) by him with ſuch extraordinary beauty and truth, join'd to the uncommon lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of his ink, has ſurpaſs'd all the wood-cutters ever ſince. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for preferring this method of cutting on wood to that of copper plates; were; 1. The rouling-preſs, which is wholly us'd in the later, was not then ſo perfect as ſince; 2. His moſt conſiderable works (of which he was the author, for he ſcarce printed any other) being chiefly geometry, perſpective, fortification and architecture as well as hiſtory, wooden cutts were much the more eligible method upon ſeveral accounts, eſpecially when cut by ſuch a maſterly hand as his. The only difficulty was to make it ſubſervient to his hiſtory-pieces; but that he eaſily ſurmounted by the ſtrength of his genius; and thoſe who have ſeen any of his performances even in this kind, will readily own that nothing of that nature ever equall'd them. His uſual mark was the initial letters of his name AD joyn'd together thus <figure>
                              <figDesc>Albert Durer's printer's mark</figDesc>
                           </figure> but his moſt effectual way to prevent counterfeits was by giving his works a degree of beauty never yet attain'd to.</p>
                        <p>WITH reſpect to his Printing, I have already hinted, that he ſeldom meddled with any works but his own, as I can find; but as I have met with none done before the year 1500, tho' he probably entred into that province before that time; I ſhall not trouble the reader with a liſt of them, but content my ſelf with ſubjoining an account of a few of the moſt conſiderable, which I have ſeen: They are eſteem'd by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed maſter-pieces of the kind, and preſerv'd as monuments of the author's merit, being as follow;</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0712300300:217"/>
1. THE hiſtory of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> conſiſting of a fine ſet of draughts upon that ſubject, all cut upon wood with his own hand, and with the utmoſt beauty and truth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The hiſtory of the <hi>four goſpels,</hi> done after the ſame manner, and with the ſame beauty. Both theſe ſets are printed with the common preſs, with explanations and hiſtorical accounts of the deſigns placed either under them, or on the other ſide, or upon a diſtinct leaf. They are both in <hi>fol.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. His book of proportions, which he did not live to finiſh, but was printed by his widow after his death, is likewiſe eſteem'd another maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece in that kind. I ſhall only add, that the ſingular beauty of his ink, the excellency of the Preſs work, and in a word, the exactneſs of his performances do juſtly rank him amongſt the greateſt genius's of the age. I hope therefore the reader will excuſe this digreſſion in favour of a perſon to whom the world owes the great improvements made in the art of cutting upon wood, which has been ſo ſerviceable to the Printers in the ornamental part of their works.</p>

                     <p>PARMA is another ancient city in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> call'd by the Romans <hi>Gallia Ciſalpina,</hi> ſituate in a very pleaſant large plain, and ſo well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with paſture ground, that it is recorded by <hi>Martial</hi> for the great number of cattel it bred, <hi>Tondet &amp; innumeros Gallica Parma greges.</hi> It
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0712300300:219"/>
was once under the pope's government, and given by <hi>Paul</hi> III. to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, with the title of dukes of <hi>Parma,</hi> under whom it has continu'd ever ſince. Tho' this city receiv'd the Art of Printing ſo early as the year 1472, yet it had but very few artificers, and a ſmall number of editions printed there. It may indeed be reaſonably ſuppos'd that theſe being ſo much inferior to thoſe of <hi>Venice, Rome, Paris, &amp;c.</hi> have been moſtly deſtroy'd; and the ſame may be ſaid of many other cities. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Parma</hi> deſerves to be remember'd, if not for the number and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of her Printers, yet for having given birth to ſome of the greateſt of that time, who were (perhaps for want of ſufficient encouragement here) oblig'd to ſettle in other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> Among theſe were the famous <hi>Antony Zarot,</hi> who printed at <hi>Milan</hi> a great many fine and correct vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, as we have ſhewn under that article, <hi>Fauſto, Vincenzo,</hi> and <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legrino del Bonardi,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew de Parma</hi> in <hi>Bolognia,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Capcaſa</hi> in <hi>Venice, Mich. Manzoli</hi> in <hi>Treviſo,</hi> with many more whoſe name and place of birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the reader will find in the article of each of thoſe cities. The firſt book, we meet with printed here, is the works of the famous lawyer <hi>Baldus;</hi> but hath no Printer's name, tho' it is dated at <hi>Parma ann.</hi> 1471. However 'tis probable it was printed by <hi>Stephen Corali,</hi> a native of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who is the firſt in our liſt, and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (or rather might reprint) the ſame work the year following.</p>

                     <p>BUT whether that city choſe to drive any other trade, rather than that of books, or whether they found it already furniſhed from other places, and ſo met with but ſmall encouragement; or for whatever other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, 'tis certain they tarry'd not long there. For <hi>Moravus</hi> printed but

one book in company with <hi>Monk,</hi> and the next year remov'd to <hi>Naples,</hi> where he continued 'till <hi>ann.</hi> 1490, as hath been ſaid in the article of that city; and we hear no further of <hi>Monk.</hi> The book they printed here is,</p>

                     <p>It is very likely, that the ill ſucceſs of theſe two Printers, frighten'd others from coming thither, for we don't meet with any that ventur'd to ſettle there after them, 'till a long time after the cloſe of the century.</p>

                        <head>4. JOHN AMERBACH, 1481.</head>
                        <p>JOHN AMERBACH, one of the moſt excellent and learned Printers of his time, was at firſt a ſtudent at <hi>Paris,</hi> under the famous <hi>Jo. Lapidanus</hi> or <hi>a Lapide,</hi> who, being rector of that univerſity, invited the three <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> thither. <hi>Amerbach</hi> follow'd his ſtudies 'till he attain'd to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of maſter of arts, ſoon after which he came to <hi>Baſil,</hi> and ſet up the Art of Printing, for which he became as famous, as he had been before for his learning.</p>
                        <p>WHAT countryman he was is not eaſy to determine. Some <hi>French</hi> annaliſts challenge him for theirs, and <hi>Orlandi</hi> calls him a <hi>Pariſian,</hi> tho' perhaps on no other account, than that he ſtudied ſo long in that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. His name is unqueſtionably <hi>German;</hi> but neither the colophons of his editions, nor his epitaph, make any mention of his country; for which reaſon, we ſhall not pretend to affirm any thing upon that head. His firſt care at his entrance into the buſineſs of Printing was to get a font of the moſt perfect round Roman, which however he made no uſe of in his books of divinity, the prevailing cuſtom of thoſe days being to print them in old Gothic. His next was to procure ſome of the beſt correctors of that age, of whom, tho' no perſon was more capable of correcting his works than himſelf, he had a greater number than any of his contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Among theſe were <hi>Martin Dodo</hi> a prebend, <hi>Francis Wyler</hi> a learned Franciſcan fryar, <hi>Conrard Pelican</hi> an eminent divine, <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> and others. He was ſo carefull and diligent in this province, that he would not let one ſheet paſs unrevis'd by himſelf. <hi>Reuchlin</hi> gives us this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him in the preface to his book <hi>De verbo mirifico,</hi> that he was a man of an excellent genius, highly valuable for the neatneſs and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his works, and well ſkill'd in ſeveral arts and ſciences. His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer maſter <hi>Jo. Lapidanus</hi> aſſures us <note n="1" place="bottom">I ſtud ego non favoris, ſed veritatis gratia auſim dicere, quod non legerim libros hac arte effictos, quos tuis emendatiores exactiorique ſtilo conſummatos probaverim.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0712300300:230"/>
or more correctly printed than his. As <hi>Amerbach</hi> was a man of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular piety and zeal for religion, which appears from all his prefaces, that ſcarce breathe any thing elſe; ſo he rather choſe to conſecrate his labours to that, than any other branch of learning. This induc'd him to print the works of all the ancient fathers, a taſk hitherto unattempted by any Printer. He began with an edition of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which he finiſh'd not 'till the year 1505, in the old Gothic. But as he neither had a good manuſcript to print after, nor ſufficient aſſiſtance from the learned; we can only ſay that it was executed as correctly, as could be expected in thoſe times. What he had moſt at heart was to publiſh St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s works, which, as he knew was impoſſible to be done without a competent ſkill in the <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongues, the laſt of which he was too old and full of buſineſs to learn, he made his three ſons, youths of bright parts, divide that province among themſelves; who having ſtudy'd thoſe languages, were oblig'd by him, whether he liv'd or dy'd, to finiſh that edition; which they faithfully perform'd. But as this taſk, wherein he was engaged, was too large for one man, he took the learned <hi>John Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> whom we ſhall mention hereafter, into partnerſhip, and printed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral valuable and diſtinct volumes with him. The greateſt part of theſe particulars we have from <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in his prefaces to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> which later edition he revis'd and publiſh'd <hi>anno</hi> 1515, with a dedication to the archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> He highly extolls the piety of the <hi>Amerbachs,</hi> he praiſes the father for having taken ſuch care of his ſons education; and the ſons for the great progreſs they made in thoſe tongues, and for their piety in having ſo exactly fulfill'd their father's deſire, in the impreſſion of a work, which had coſt them ſo much money and pains; he frankly owns, that as he ſtood in great need of ſome aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, ſo he was chiefly beholden to thoſe three learned brothers for it <note n="1" place="bottom">

                        <p>HE continu'd printing 'till the year 1528, and dyed whilſt his ſecond impreſſion of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was in the preſs.

                        <head>5. JOHN FROBEN, 1491.</head>
                        <p>JOHN FROBEN was a native of <hi>Hamelburgh</hi> in <hi>Fraconia,</hi> where he ſtudy'd 'till he became maſter of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, and afterwards went to the univerſity of <hi>Baſil,</hi> where he perfected himſelf in <hi>Greek</hi> alſo, and betook himſelf to the buſineſs of Printing, of which he ſhow'd himſelf ſo good a maſter, that <hi>John Amerbach</hi> took him as aſſiſtant and partner in his laborious and expenſive undertaking of publiſhing the ancient fathers, as we hinted before. He acquitted himſelf ſo well both in this province and his own particular one, that he acquir'd as great a reputation and eſteem among the learned, as his contemporary and partner; to whom <hi>Germany</hi> is oblig'd for bringing thither the neat round Roman character, hitherto ſcarcely known there, and improving it to the laſt degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. No perſon was ever more curious in the choice of the works, which he ſent to the preſs, than he; who had this excellent quality among many others, that he would never print any bad books, ſuch as the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did avarice of other Printers had overſtock'd the world with; but always choſe the beſt authors, and beſt manuſcripts of them, ſparing neither
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0712300300:233"/>
coſt in purchaſing them, nor pains in correcting and fitting them for the preſs; in which, tho' he was a man of ſingular learning, yet he always preferr'd the advice and judgment of the learned of his time, to his own. Among theſe were <hi>Mark Heyland, Eraſmus, Wolfgang Muſculus, Jo. Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius, Wolfgang, Lachner</hi> and others, all perſons of the higheſt rank in the commonwealth of learning; for which reaſons his impreſſions have ever been, and will continue in the higheſt eſteem with all the learned. He was likewiſe particularly ambitious to have his works correct; and the abovemention'd learned men aſſiſted him very much in that province; eſpecially <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> who tells us <note n="1" place="bottom">

However, neither <hi>Froben</hi>'s nor his corrector's diligence could prevent that edition, juſt now quoted in the margin, from having an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata of a page and half, tho' <hi>Eraſmus</hi> gave the finiſhing hand to every proof.</p>
                        <p>THIS learned author, in one of his letters to <hi>Bilibaldus Parcheimerus,</hi> who was then at the emperor's court, complains highly of a great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done to many good Printers in general, and to <hi>Froben</hi> particularly, which was, that he had no ſooner publiſh'd a good edition with great coſt and labour, but it was immediately reprinted by others, and ſold ſo much cheaper, that he could never reimburſe himſelf half his charges.

                        <p>JO. FROBEN printed few volumes before the year 1500, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe which are extant, is ſtill ſmaller. One of them was his concordance of the bible in <hi>fol. ann..</hi> 1495; concerning which we meet with ſome particulars, not unworthy the reader's knowledge, tho' a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from our ſubject.</p>
                        <p>FIRST it was ſo exactly printed, that there was not one error in all the numerical figures, which in a work of that nature are at leaſt one third part of the matter; and is therefore very ſurprizing. <hi>Froben</hi> added a ſecond part to it, which contain'd all the indeclinable particles, that are to be met with in the bible. This work was begun at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by <hi>Jo. de Raguza,</hi> a Pariſian divine of the Dominican order, embaſſador
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0712300300:235"/>
from the council of <hi>Baden</hi> to the emperor <hi>Jo. Paleologus</hi> about the year 1436; yet he did little to it himſelf, but left it to his three chaplains, one of whom was a <hi>Scotchman</hi> nam'd <hi>Walter Sonaw,</hi> who finiſh'd it in almoſt three years. After this it was reduc'd into an alphabetical order, by the directions of that council, by <hi>John de Segovia</hi> or <hi>Secubia,</hi> archdeacon of <hi>Cujedo,</hi> and doctor of divinity. What gave birth to this ſecond part of the concordance was no leſs remarkable, <hi>John de Raguza</hi> beforemention'd, coming to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> found the divines there engag'd in a very warm diſpute concerning the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether from the Son as well as from the Father; and that the controverſy ſeem'd chiefly to be about the particles <hi>ex</hi> and <hi>per, i. e.</hi> whether it ſhould be <hi>ex filio</hi> or <hi>per filium.</hi> He was likewiſe inform'd, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> and all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> having heard, that <hi>Paleologus</hi> deſign'd a journey into chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, in order to reconcile this difference between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> churches, had rally'd the chriſtians with no ſmall ſcorn, whom two ſuch ſeemingly inſignificant particles had divided to ſuch a degree. This embaſſador fail'd not to acquaint the council with it, who immediately order'd <hi>John de Segovia</hi> to be ready to anſwer all the difficulties, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhould propoſe at their arrival at <hi>Baſil.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Huſſites</hi> and <hi>John Huſs</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who were already at <hi>Baſil,</hi> and inſiſted upon a communion in both kinds from the words of our Saviour, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you eat,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>unleſs you drink,</hi> &amp;c. which their oppoſers ſaid ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd no more than, unleſs you eat or drink, from which they concluded that either the one or the other was ſufficient to fulfill the command; theſe I ſay made it ſtill more neceſſary to have a concordance, that ſhould explain the meaning of thoſe particles <hi>ex</hi> and <hi>per, niſi</hi> and <hi>et,</hi> and in how many different ſenſes they were us'd in ſcripture. This induc'd <hi>John de Segovia</hi> to write the ſecond part of the concordance relating to indecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable words, with a prolegomenon or preface, in which he hath given us this account of the occaſion of it. The learned <hi>Sebaſtian Brant,</hi> author of the <hi>Navis ſtultifera,</hi> caus'd it to be printed by <hi>Froben, ann.</hi> 1495, and ſomewhat above twenty years after the ſame, <hi>Froben</hi> reprinted it with an elegant <hi>Latin</hi> dialogue between a bookſeller and the buyer, relating to the value of good books, inſtead of a preface to that edition. The reader may ſee it at length in <hi>Chevillier,</hi> p. 130.</p>

FROBEN had two ſons <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who ſucceeded their father, and publiſh'd a great number of volumes with good reputation after his death, which happen'd <hi>ann.</hi> 1527. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tells us that what he had moſt at heart was to give the world a correct edition of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s works, and that he deſir'd to live no longer than to ſee it finiſh'd <note n="1" place="bottom">Ut inter familiares ſubinde dicere ſolitus  fit, ſe non optare longius vitae ſpatium, quam quod abſolvendo ſufficeret Auguſtino. <hi>Eraſm. epiſt. ad Ammonium.</hi> Tom. 3. oper. p. 759.</note>. However he was depriv'd of that pleaſure, for <hi>J. And-Endters</hi> tells us tho' he kept ſeven preſſes continually at work upon that edition, yet not above two volumes of it were printed before he died, to the great loſs and grief of all the learned world: the following epitaph, written by his friend <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> was afterwards ſet upon his tomb.</p>

                        <p>THIS epitaph was afterwards printed, according to <hi>la Caille,</hi> in <hi>Henry Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen's Artis Typographicae Querimonia; Eraſmus</hi> wrote another of four verſes in <hi>Greek,</hi> which the Reader may ſee in <hi>Matt.

                        <p>ERASMUS was not contented with writing the abovemention'd epitaphs in his late friend's praiſe, but he made likewiſe a kind of funeral oration or rather elogium upon him, in a letter to <hi>John Emſted</hi> a learned <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian;</hi> the reader may ſee it at full length in the above-mention'd <hi>Annals,</hi> vol. 2. pag. 36, <hi>&amp; ſeq</hi>

                        <p>AND indeed it was no more than he ow'd him, ſince <hi>Froben</hi> had long before given him a pleaſure, which few men beſide him had ever taſted, which was to ſee his own elegy before his death; the occaſion of it was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0712300300:237"/>
as follows. Before theſe two were become intimate, <hi>Froben</hi> had heard that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was dead, and wrote much ſuch another funeral oration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which he prefix'd to an edition of that great man's proverbs, which he publiſh'd <hi>Ann.</hi> 1513: <hi>Eraſmus</hi> could not but be highly pleas'd to ſee himſelf prais'd in ſo extraordinary and ſincere a manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aſſur'd that ſuch encomiums could not proceed from flattery or ſelf intereſt; for <hi>Eraſmus</hi> being ſuppos'd dead, <hi>Froben</hi> could have nothing to hope from him; and had any but a man of <hi>Froben</hi>'s integrity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour committed ſuch a miſtake, one might be apt to ſuſpect it had been wilfully done, in hopes of procuring ſome valuable pieces from that learned author: but whoever is acquainted with that Printer's character, will undoubtedly believe him incapable of ſuch mean arts. I think therefore it will not be amiſs to cloſe the hiſtory of this great Printer with ſome conſpicuous parts of his character, which we have not yet touch'd upon, and which will eaſily acquit him of any ſuſpicion; which is, that he was a man of the moſt diſintereſted and generous diſpoſition. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his letter to <hi>Emſted</hi> abovemention'd does even tell us, that he was ſo to a fault, and that he had often reprov'd him for it, but in vain, for his natural candor was proof againſt all admonitions of that kind: neither did his munificence to men of learning and merit ſhow it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only in the largeneſs of his preſents to them, but in the manner of beſtowing them; never, ſays that author, did he ſeem better pleas'd than when he had, either by intreaties or by ſome cunning device, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon them to accept of ſome favour from him. The grief he ſhew'd in his countenance at their denial was ſuch, that they found it more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to refuſe a favour from him, than to obtain one from another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and when by chance, continues he, I have bought me ſome cloath for a gown, he has privately ſent, and paid for it unknown to me. As his houſe was open to all learned men, ſo none had a heartier welcome than <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who us'd it as his home all the time he continued at <hi>Baſil,</hi> and it is probable that he might have continued longer there, had he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſomething in his family, which he could not forbear grieving at. <hi>Froben</hi> was under petticoat-government, which made his affairs go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wrong, wherefore he expreſſes himſelf thus to him in a letter da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Louvain; Fama tibi parta eſt, ea poterit tibi magno emolumento</hi>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0712300300:238"/>

But <hi>Froben</hi> was of too eaſy and patient a temper, to give himſelf any trouble about it: we have a remarkable inſtance of this in the laſt year of his life, when being ſeiz'd with ſuch a violent pain in his right heel, that ſome phyſicians were for cutting off his foot, he had no ſooner receiv'd ſome eaſement in it, than he went on horſeback to <hi>Frankfort</hi> about ſome buſineſs; and tho' advis'd by his friends to ſtir ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer abroad, to go warmer in cloaths, and to ſpare himſelf as much as poſſible, he refus'd to hearken to them, and took ſuch care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his bad ſtate of health, and the anguiſh of his pain, that he went ſtill about his buſineſs; 'till being ſeiz'd with a fainting fit, he dropt down and broke his ſkull againſt the pavement; after which he continued two days, without any ſenſe or motion, and expir'd <hi>ann.</hi> 1528. I hope the name and character of the perſon will excuſe my account of theſe particularities, eſpecially ſince the great <hi>Eraſmus</hi> has thought them worth recording in a much ampler manner: he left two ſons <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who became excellent Printers, and ſignaliz'd themſelves by their editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> fathers; he had likewiſe ſome daughters, one of whom nam'd <hi>Juſtina</hi> he marry'd to <hi>Nicolas l'Eveſque</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> an eminent Printer of <hi>Baſil.</hi>

It is very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for its trade, port, fortifications, riches, and number of inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>HITHER the Art of Printing was brought <hi>anno</hi> 1475, yet appears to have met with but little encouragement from its trading inhabitants, for we find only four Printers in this city from 1471 to 1502, and they were ſo far from ſettling here any time, that their bad ſucceſs had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them to quit the place, for we have but five editions extant of them all; their names are as follows.</p>

                     <p>THO' this city doth not ſeem to have cultivated the Art of Printing within her walls, ſo much as other cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> yet it ought to be remembred for having given birth to ſome eminent Printers, who went

                        <p>PRINTED the <hi>Summa</hi> of <hi>Archiep.

                        <p>IT will not be improper to obſerve here, that our lateſt annaliſts place the city of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> under this year; the oldeſt edition as yet diſcover'd by them being <hi>Socrates</hi>'s <hi>Sayings</hi> printed by <hi>Caxton, anno</hi> 1477; however the reader will find by the third book of this hiſtory, that there is a more ancient one by three years, <hi>viz.

                     <p>LYONS, a rich and populous city in <hi>France,</hi> upon the rivers <hi>Rhone</hi> and <hi>Arare,</hi> is call'd in <hi>Latin, Lugdunum,</hi> and is allow'd to be one of the moſt ancient cities in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo that ſome <hi>French</hi> writers have not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to fix the date of its foundation within 600 or 700 years after the flood, which may more eaſily be believ'd than diſprov'd. It has been always eminent for men of learning in all arts and ſciences, which were particularly cultivated there, but more eſpecially after the Art of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was introduc'd; which receiv'd ſuch encouragement there, that it has continu'd in a flouriſhing condition ever ſince. Some annaliſts have aſſerted that it is the firſt city in <hi>France</hi> which ſet up a Printing-preſs; but if we would judge of this controverſy by the dates of the oldeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0712300300:245"/>
we ſhall find that the city of <hi>Tours,</hi> and next that of <hi>Paris</hi> had the Art ſeveral years before, as hath been already ſhewn. However, if <hi>Lyons</hi> hath not the preference of <hi>Rome, Paris, Venice,</hi> &amp;c. either for the antiquity or beauty of its productions; it muſt be acknowledg'd that it hath gain'd it by the quantity of large impreſſions, than which no city in <hi>Europe</hi> has furniſh'd the learned with a greater number. It is ſtill a great <hi>emporium</hi> or market for books in all languages and ſciences; and as it hath encourag'd ſome of the beſt artiſts to ſettle there, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh beautiful and correct editions, ſo it has induc'd many a wretched one to chuſe it as a proper place to print and vend a much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bad and counterfeit ones; but this hath happen'd in moſt famous cities of <hi>Europe. Lyons</hi> hath likewiſe been celebrated, if not for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, at leaſt for encouraging, the <hi>Gothick</hi> character, and publiſh'd more volumes of that ſort, in proportion to thoſe that were done in fine Roman, than any other city; and what is more remarkable of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this city, they were vaſtly more fond of that inelegant character than of the Roman, eſpecially for bibles, divinity, law and phyſick books.</p>
                     <p>THE reader will be juſtly ſurpriz'd to hear what encomiums they gave it, and how proud they were of their performances in that kind. I have ſubjoin'd in the margin three or four ſcraps of their colophons, to ſhew what a piece of merit the Printers of the 15th and above half of the 16th century made of their works printed in this character, not only at <hi>Lyons,</hi> but likewiſe at <hi>Venice, Paris, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="1" place="bottom">Sublimi literarum effigie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <head>19. JODOCUS BADIUS, <hi>ſirnam'd</hi> ASCENSIUS, 1495.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Badius</hi> was born in the caſtle of <hi>Aſe,</hi> in the territories of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and call'd <hi>Aſcenſius</hi> from it. He ſpent his younger years in ſtudy at <hi>Bruſſels, Gaunt,</hi> and laſt of all in the univerſity of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> under the great <hi>Bapt. Guarini,</hi> where he became maſter of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues, and very famous for his learning and parts. He remov'd afterwards to the city of <hi>Lyons,</hi> where he publickly taught thoſe two languages, and became corrector to <hi>Jo. Trechſel</hi>'s preſs, as has been ſaid before. He publiſh'd ſeveral works, ſome of which were his own, as <hi>Silvae mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales contra vitia.</hi> fol. 1492. <hi>Epigrammatum</hi> lib. 1. <hi>Navicula Stultarum mulierum;</hi> the Life of <hi>Thomas a Kempis</hi> prefix'd to his works, and ſome others. Several excellent commentaries were likewiſe written by him upon the greateſt part of the claſſicks, and other <hi>Latin</hi> authors, as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, Juvenal, Martial, Lucretius, Seneca, Saluſt, Valerius Maximus, Quintilian, Aulus Gellius,</hi> and others; all which he printed himſelf in <hi>folio</hi> very elegantly and correctly, tho' ſome of the firſt he caus'd to be printed by <hi>John Trechſel,</hi> whoſe daughter he afterwards married and had many children by her. To all his editions, which were not a few, he us'd to prefix an epiſtle dedicatory, addreſs'd to ſome perſon, eminent either for his quality, piety or learning. Among others, he dedicated the firſt Volume of <hi>Tho. Waldenſis</hi> works to pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. After he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the buſineſs of printing upon him; he became ſo excellent a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the learned <hi>Rob. Gaguin,</hi> general of the Trinitarian Order,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0712300300:248"/>
who was perfectly well acquainted with his merit, wrote a letter to him, to deſire him to undertake the printing of his works. This with ſome other invitations of the learned, brought <hi>Badius</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> about 1499, preſently after his father-in-law's death, where he deſign'd to teach the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, and where his laſt endeavour, after he had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd himſelf with fine ſets of Roman characters, was to explode the old Gothick both in his works, and by his example, as we hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And accordingly printed the <hi>Philobiblion</hi> of that great encourager of learning, <hi>Richard Bury,</hi> lord high chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and founder of the <hi>Oxford</hi> library, towards the middle of the 14th century; which book was ſent to him by Dr. <hi>Bureau,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Ciſteron,</hi> and confeſſor to the <hi>French</hi> king, in order to be printed by him. This was the firſt book known that came to the preſs after he ſet it up at <hi>Paris;</hi> 'tis dated 1500; the next year he printed the <hi>Provinciale, ſeu conſtitutiones Angliae, cum Annotationibus Gullielmi Lindewode</hi> 1501, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> vol. fol. in a beautiful round Roman. This book, as <hi>de la Caille</hi> tells us, is very ſcarce, and much ſought for, being very neceſſary for thoſe who would underſtand the old <hi>French</hi> us'd in <hi>William</hi> the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's time, tho' I doubt he is miſtaken, the work itſelf being in <hi>Latin.</hi> He began to print by himſelf about the year 1495, at which time the great <hi>Aldus Manutius</hi> began at <hi>Venice;</hi> than whom neither that age nor the next produc'd two more learned or excellent Printers.</p>
                        <p>As this later was chiefly engag'd in printing and correcting of <hi>Greek</hi> authors, ſo <hi>Badius</hi> was employ'd in the <hi>Latin</hi> ones; and there ſeem'd a kind of friendly emulation between them, each carrying away the palm in a ſeparate province. Upon account of this merit the editor of <hi>Guil. de Rubione</hi> in his dedication to the earl of <hi>Caſtille</hi> calls <hi>Aſcenſius</hi> a perſon skill'd in all kinds of ſcience, and the prince of printers <note n="1" place="bottom">Omnigenere diſciplinarum eruditiſſimo <hi>Aſcenſio,</hi> impreſſoriae artis primati.</note>; and <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> ranks him among the <hi>Scriptores Eccleſiaſtici,</hi> when he was but two and thirty years of age, and gives him the following panegyrick, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was a perfect maſter of literature, not unskilful in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a good philoſopher, orator and poet, a man of a bright genius and a fluent tongue, <note n="2" place="bottom">Vir in ſecularibus literis eruditiſſimus, &amp; divinarum ſcripturarum non ignarus, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, rhetor, &amp; poeta clariſſimus, ingenio excellens &amp; diſertus eloqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This made not only the learned very ambitious to have their works printed by him, but the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent bookſellers of <hi>Paris</hi> were glad, in order to have him for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to aſſociate themſelves with him; among whom, <hi>John Petit</hi> ſworn bookſeller to that univerſity, and one of the moſt famous of that age, caus'd ſeveral noble editions to be printed by him as the <hi>Calepini Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onarium octo Linguar.</hi> 1516. <hi>Origen.

Thus he continued printing and writing with great applauſe and reputation till the year 1534, in which he died.

                        <p>His mark was the draught of a printing-houſe with the words <hi>Praelum Aſcenſianum</hi> upon the head of the preſs, the glory and credit of which dy'd not with him, but continued above 35 years in his own family; for <hi>Badius,</hi> whoſe love to learning, and in particular to the Art of Printing, was conſpicuous thro' his whole life, prevail'd upon himſelf to breed up his only ſon <hi>Conrard Badius</hi> to the buſineſs of Printing, after he had perfected him in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues, and in ſeveral other branches of literature. <hi>Conrard</hi> became ſo famous upon all theſe accounts, that the learned <hi>Henry Stephens</hi> has thought fit to tranſmit to us an elegant <hi>Latin</hi> epitaph made upon him, which the reader may ſee in <hi>de la Caille</hi> p. 131. <hi>Badius</hi> had likewiſe a brother nam'd <hi>John,</hi> who became an eminent printer, and left a conſiderable number of good edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions behind him; and as if this had not been enough to have three out of his family brought up to the Art of Printing, he marry'd his three daughters to three of the moſt eminent printers in <hi>Paris, Robert Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, Michael Vaſcoſan,</hi> and <hi>John de Roigny.</hi> The two former of theſe are too celebrated to need a panegyrick here; and the laſt took his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law's mark, ſucceeded him in his printing-houſe with great reputation, and ſignaliz'd himſelf by the elegancy and correctneſs of a great number of editions, which came from his preſſes; he left a ſon nam'd <hi>Michael,</hi> who did not prove much inferior to his father or grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father.</p>

                     <p n="4">§. 4. CEULEN. Our annaliſts are at a loſs where to find this place, I imagine it to be the city of <hi>Cologn,</hi> which the Printer might not know how to ſpell right, neither do the Germans write it much unlike it. We find but one impreſſion in <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> it is call'd <hi>Splegel der Saſſen met de Gloſſen daarop,</hi> fol. 1480.</p>

is a place in the <hi>Roman</hi> territories, more famous for an excellent wine in great requeſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> than for this obſcure edition which is the only one we have printed there.

                     <p>§. 1. PISA is an antient, rich and populous city of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where the Art of Printing got but ſmall footing and encouragement. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely that the wars which rag'd in ſeveral parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> from the time of the art's being brought to it, might be a great cauſe of the ſmall progreſs it made in this, as well as many other, otherwiſe, conſiderable cities of <hi>Italy.</hi> We find but 4 editions printed here, the three firſt dated 1482, 1484 and 1489, are without Printers names. The only one that has, is <hi>Antonii Parnormit. libri</hi> IV. <hi>dictorum factorum,</hi> &amp;c. fol. by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory de Gente. Piſis</hi> 1485.</p>

Aquilae</hi> 1482.</p>
                     <p>ORLANDI tells us pag. 196, that Mr. <hi>Robert Frebairn,</hi> (now the king's Printer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a particular friend of mine) ſhew'd him among ſome of his curious annotations upon editions which he had ſeen, the firſt part of the aforeſaid lives printed at <hi>Aquila, ann.</hi> 1472; but ſaid, he never could ſee the ſecond part which was afterwards added to the firſt. The credit of this entirely depends upon that gentleman's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; but our author ſays, that he never ſaw any other part but this which we have given, nor heard of it from any but him.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. AT <hi>Erford,</hi> a large city in <hi>Germany,</hi> erected into an univerſity <hi>ann.</hi> 1391, and ſubject to the elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> was printed <hi>Lutreus de anima. Erford</hi> 1482.</p>

                        <hi>Article</hi> 1. <hi>The Town of</hi> SONCINO, 1484.</head>
                     <p>SONCINO is a town or caſtle in the duchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> between <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Cremona,</hi> and famous for being the place in which the firſt <hi>Hebrew</hi> books were printed. The Chriſtians had hitherto eſteem'd ſuch a deſign too expenſive and impracticable; it being ſcarce poſſible to find artiſts in thoſe early days, who could cut punches exactly enough in that difficult and unpractis'd character. Another difficulty, which ſeem'd to them almoſt unſurmountable was, that to caſt the letters with the points and accents, would multiply the caſes to an exceſſive degree; and to print without points, accents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would have infallibly prevented the ſale of their books, becauſe few at that time, except the Jews, could
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0712300300:258"/>
read without them; and to caſt the points and accents by themſelves, and interline them as now, ſeem'd then perhaps wholly impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We have ſeen under the article of <hi>Aldus Manucius,</hi> that he procur'd a fone of <hi>Hebrew</hi> types; but tho' the Jews had already printed at <hi>Soncino</hi> and elſewhere for above twelve or fifteen years, which might have given him an inſight into their method of printing in that language, yet he found it ſo difficult, that he made but little uſe of them; and I can find nothing done by him in that kind, but an <hi>Hebrew</hi> alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, which <hi>Chevilier</hi> tells us is preſerv'd in the <hi>Sorbon</hi> library. The Jews therefore, as they were the fitteſt for ſuch a province, were the firſt who ſet about it. What encouragement they might receive from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ſuch an undertaking, I cannot affirm; yet it is probable they might in a great meaſure depend upon that; and without leave from the Pope and the Dukes of <hi>Milan</hi> they dar'd not have attempted it. Soon after the Jews had propagated this art into ſeveral cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Breſcia, Bologna, Rimini, Fano, Peſaro,</hi> and even as far as <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Salonica,</hi> in all which places they inſcrib'd their editions as done by ſome of the family of <hi>Soncino;</hi> the Chriſtians who now began to print in <hi>Hebrew</hi> in moſt cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> at <hi>Venice, Cremona, Mantua, Verona, Ferrara, Leghorn, Padua, Naples,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>England, London</hi> and <hi>Oxford;</hi> in <hi>Germany, Baſil, Frankford, Cologn,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>France, Paris, Lyons,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome cities of <hi>Spain, Holland, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. ſet up ſome ingenious artiſts, who engag'd in that province; tho' it muſt be own'd that the editions of the Jews were far preferable to thoſe for beauty and correctneſs. However there were few impreſſions of this kind printed any where, but by theſe Jews of the <hi>Sontino</hi> family, 'till after the year 1500. Mr. <hi>Mattaire Ann. Typog.</hi> vol. 1. p. 152. makes a curious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation after father <hi>le Long,</hi> which is, that in all the books that he had ſeen printed in this tongue before that year, as often as the name of God oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in the text, they made uſe of the letter <hi>Daleth</hi> inſtead of <hi>He.</hi> Thus for inſtance they printed <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>; for which no reaſon can be aſſign'd.</p>
                     <p>I MUST not omit giving the reader an account, which we meet with in <hi>Buxtorf</hi> the father, of a book, that he tells us was in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> of a much older date than thoſe of <hi>Soncino.</hi> It was an
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0712300300:259"/>
                        <hi>Hebrew</hi> grammar intitled <hi>Mahala Scevile Haddas,</hi> written by <hi>R. Moſes Kimchi,</hi> which <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ſays had been printed in <hi>Sicily</hi> 152 years ago; <hi>Habuit Joſephus Scaliger impreſſum in Siciliâ ante annos</hi> 152. (Theſe words <hi>Buxtorf</hi> the ſon did not alter, when he reprinted his father's book at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, anno</hi> 1640 in 8vo.) This, if it be true, will oblige us to ſeek much higher for the origin of <hi>Hebrew-printing,</hi> than the year 1484; which is the time wherein <hi>Rabbi Gedaliah,</hi> and after him the learned <hi>Bartolocci</hi> have affirm'd it to have begun; for if we ſubſtract 152 years from 1613 in which <hi>Buxtorf</hi> wrote, it will bring us to the year 1461. <hi>Chevilier</hi> p. 267 tells us, that he ſaw a third edition of this grammar, printed at <hi>Ortona</hi> in the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Charles</hi> king of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> i. e. <hi>anno</hi> 1496, which ſhews that there muſt have been two editions of it before; and <hi>Cornelius a Beughen</hi> in his <hi>Incunab. Typog.</hi> p. 126 mentions an old <hi>Hebrew</hi> edition printed at <hi>Bologna, anno</hi> 1471, with this title, <hi>R. Obadia Sephorno lux populorum. Liber Hebraicus ſic dictus, Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae</hi> 1471. But as he doth not tell us in what library he met with it, and as we have not a ſufficient certainty of the truth of the dates of this and the other book mention'd by <hi>Buxtorf;</hi> I can ſee no reaſon for depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the epoch of our lateſt annaliſts, to aſſign a new one upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain grounds.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt <hi>Jew</hi> who oblig'd the world with <hi>Hebrew</hi> impreſſions, was</p>
                     <p>MOSES <hi>the Son of</hi> RABBI ISRAEL NATHAN, 1484.</p>
                     <p>A NATIVE of <hi>Spire</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe family multiply'd ſo much, and receiv'd ſuch encouragement in this undertaking, that they ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over ſeveral parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and printed many noble editions with vaſt ſucceſs and applauſe. Among theſe a ſon of this <hi>Moſes</hi> nam'd <hi>Rabbi Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> after he had printed ſeveral works at <hi>Breſcia,</hi> of which we have given an account, went and ſet up a Preſs at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cloſe of this century, and continued printing there till <hi>ann.</hi> 1530. Some of his ſons remov'd to <hi>Salonica,</hi> and other cities of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> empire, where they met with the ſame ſucceſs. But as their works, at leaſt as far as we know of them, were done after the year 1500,

For ſoon after the very infancy of Printing we meet with a great number of theſe engravers, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances were vaſtly ſuperior to the beſt of thoſe in the foregoing liſt. Of this number were <hi>Andreas Martegna</hi> in <hi>Mantua, Maſo Finiguerra</hi> in <hi>Florence, Bon Martin</hi> in <hi>Germany, Michael Volgemut</hi> and <hi>Albert Durer</hi> at <hi>Nurembergh, Iſrael Van-Mecheln</hi> at <hi>Mentz, Hans Schauflich</hi> at <hi>Nordeling,</hi> and many more; ſome of whom, tho' they were excell'd by their ſucceſſors in the following century, yet were all excellent maſters, and whoſe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0712300300:270"/>
names and works will be ſtill valu'd by all ſkilled in that Art. Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon wood became afterwards no ſmall ornament to the Art of Printing, not only for the fine cuts with which the editions were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd, but likewiſe for the front, head and tail-pieces, initial letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in time became in great vogue. It prov'd alſo of great uſe in books of architecture, geometry, proſpective, and others, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a conſiderable number of demonſtrations, figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all which caſes the wooden ones are much more expeditious, being contriv'd of the ſame height with the letters, and ſo impos'd, lock'd up and printed with them at once; whereas the copper ones muſt be printed off by themſelves, and with a different preſs, which makes this method more tedious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of ſome eminent Printers from</hi> anno 1500 <hi>to</hi> 1520; <hi>their Improvements to the Art; and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the Great and Learned; with a Catalogue of their moſt conſiderable Impreſſions in the Oriental Tongues,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE, in the introduction to this ſecond book, given the reader my reaſons for extending this hiſtory ſo far beyond the year 1500; and I preſume that he is now fully ſatisfied that it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, if I had ſtopt there; ſince the far greateſt part of thoſe Printers, who ſignaliz'd themſelves, either for their learning or their induſtry, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving every branch of Printing, appear'd not till the cloſe of that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, or the beginning of the next; and conſequently, he muſt have known little of thoſe perſons, to whom the world is particularly oblig'd for the vaſt improvements to this Art. Upon this account I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, in the preceeding chapters, the hiſtory of ſeveral famous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the end of their lives, tho' ſome of them ſurviv'd even this epocha many years. But we omitted to give a liſt of their works beyond 1500,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0712300300:271"/>
becauſe that would have ſwell'd this volume exorbitantly, and thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are leſs ſcarce than thoſe of the former century. We ſhall add nothing therefore to their hiſtory, but proceed to do juſtice to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of thoſe, who tho' they enter'd not this province, till after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 16th century, yet may be juſtly eſteem'd contemporaries with the former.</p>
                  <p>'TIS not however to be expected that we ſhould proſecute the ſame method, as in the former chapters, by ſhewing the progreſs of the Art thro' every city, much leſs by giving an account of every particular Printer, and the number of their impreſſions; ſince ſuch an hiſtory, how ſuccinct ſoever, would be too large for a ſingle chapter. Our deſign is therefore only to mention the moſt conſiderable Printers, and to point out the great improvements which each of them made to this Art, the encouragement they met with, and the noble impreſſions in all languages, particularly the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic,</hi> &amp;c. (the firſt of which had been juſtly eſſay'd, before 1500, but the other ſcarce attempted) with an account of the undertakers and aſſiſtants in that difficult province. For as to the beauty of the characters, whether Roman or Greek, they were brought to ſuch a degree of perfection in the preceeding century by the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as hardly admitted of much additional beauty.</p>
                  <p>TO proceed in order, we ſhould begin with the Germans, to whom we owe the Art; tho' the Italians were the authors of thoſe improvements, which the former were too indolent in imitating; for the oriental tongues, and even the Greek, which the Italians had made a very conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in, was ſtill much neglected by them; ſo that except <hi>Amerbach</hi> and <hi>Froben</hi> at <hi>Baſil</hi> in <hi>Switzerland</hi> (which can ſcarce be call'd a part of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many)</hi> who printed an <hi>Hebrew</hi> pſalter, and <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s <hi>Greek</hi> teſtament with his <hi>Latin</hi> verſion of it, <hi>anno</hi> 1586, we meet with but three eminent perſons, who attempted to print in the Eaſtern languages. The firſt is <hi>John Schott</hi> of <hi>Strasburgh, anno</hi> 1515, who printed <hi>Lucian</hi>'s dialogues of the gods in <hi>Greek</hi> with the <hi>Latin</hi> verſion of <hi>Othomar Nachtgall,</hi> with the title page in red, and ſome ornaments on the margin of the <hi>Greek</hi> text, and an <hi>errata</hi> at the end. By the compliments which the tranſlator makes him in the preface, he ſeems to have been a very good Printer. He printed for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0712300300:272"/>
                     <hi>George Maxill</hi> about five years before. His rebus or mark is in the table at the end of this book. The ſecond is <hi>Eucharius Cervicorn (i. e.</hi> Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn) at <hi>Cologn,</hi> who printed ſome <hi>Greek</hi> editions, the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 1517, is the <hi>Hours of the bleſſed Virgin Mary,</hi> the <hi>ſeven penitential Pſalms,</hi> and ſome litanies and prayers in <hi>Greek,</hi> with one or two more after. His types are tolerable, but the edition ſomewhat faulty. The third is <hi>John Potken</hi> of the ſame city, who publiſh'd there a pſalter in <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latin</hi> and <hi>Aethiopic, anno</hi> 1518, 4to. This perſon travell'd into <hi>India, Aethiopia, Aegypt,</hi> &amp;c. in order to become maſter of the <hi>Chaldiac</hi> or <hi>Aethiopic,</hi> and tranſlated the pſalter into that language, and publiſh'd it with the other verſions. He promis'd in his preface to perform ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing likewiſe in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> if he ſhould meet with ſufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I do not find that he executed this. As for the Printer of this pſalter, his name is no where to be found in the book.</p>
                  <p>THIS is all I know of, that has been attempted by the Germans in that kind; tho' to do them juſtice in another reſpect, they were induſtrious in printing <hi>Latin</hi> works that were very voluminous; particularly the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretum Gratiani,</hi> printed by <hi>Henry Eggeſtein,</hi> at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> which exceeds all that have been ſince printed for bulk; and <hi>Vincentii Speculum,</hi> by <hi>John Mentel,</hi> in ten large volumes, <hi>fol.</hi> In the following century they have been no leſs diligent, and publiſh'd a very conſiderable number of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
                  <p>ITALY follows in courſe; where, tho' great numbers of editions of the antient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> writers, as well as of the modern, were publiſh'd; yet the <hi>Hebrew, Arabic,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem'd almoſt wholly neglected. 'Tis true, that there had been, as we obſerv'd, two <hi>Hebrew</hi> editions at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> one <hi>anno</hi> 1491, and the other <hi>anno</hi> 1497; and that the Jews of <hi>Soncino</hi> had printed ſeveral <hi>Hebrew</hi> volumes there from 1485, to the cloſe of the century; and, having diſpers'd themſelves into other cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> continued printing their own books in that language. But with reſpect to the Chriſtians, no direct attempts were made that way, 'till <hi>Daniel Bombergh,</hi> an <hi>Antwerpian,</hi> ſet up a Printing-houſe for <hi>Hebrew</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> His firſt work was the <hi>Hebrew</hi> bible, <hi>anno</hi> 1511, 4to, reprinted by him ſeveral times, and particularly <hi>anno</hi> 1518; in which year he likewiſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0712300300:273"/>
printed his <hi>Bibliae Hebraea Rabinica</hi> in <hi>fol.</hi> containing the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text of the bible, the <hi>Maſora</hi> and <hi>Targums</hi> of <hi>Onkelos, Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, R. Joſeph,</hi> ſirnam'd the <hi>Blind,</hi> and other <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s comments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he dedicated to <hi>Leo</hi> X. But tho' <hi>Bombergh</hi> took a great deal of pains in this impreſſion, and was himſelf a good maſter of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which he had learn'd of <hi>Foelix Pratenſis,</hi> a learned <hi>Italian,</hi> who perſuaded him to undertake this edition, and aſſiſted in correcting it; yet the Jews ſet no value upon it; but <hi>Rabbi Chajin</hi> prevail'd on him to print another in 4 vol. in <hi>fol.</hi> which he did <hi>anno</hi> 1525; and which was reprinted <hi>anno</hi> 1548. 'Tis not my buſineſs to enquire into the merit of thoſe editions; yet I cannot but obſerve, after ſeveral great criticks, that the Jews have always ſucceeded better in works of this kind than the Chriſtians, as being more us'd to the niceties of the tongue, eſpecially in its points and accents. <hi>Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh</hi> continued printing in <hi>Hebrew</hi> near forty years; and all his works were highly eſteem'd on account of the beauty of the character and impreſſion, their correctneſs, the fineneſs of the paper, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he printed, which <hi>Joſ. Scaliger</hi> tells us amounted to above four millions of crowns of gold. He made uſe of the moſt learned Jews for his correctors. His greateſt work was the <hi>Talmud</hi> printed <hi>anno</hi> 1520 in xi vol. <hi>fol. F. Bartolocci</hi> obſerv'd, that after his death <hi>Hebrew-printing</hi> declin'd exceedingly.</p>
                  <p>THE next improvement of this Art was by printing <hi>Polyglot</hi> works; and herein the city of <hi>Genoa</hi> firſt oblig'd the world. <hi>Peter Paul Porrus,</hi> a native of <hi>Milan,</hi> but inhabitant of <hi>Turin,</hi> an eminent Printer, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to print the<note n="1" place="bottom">Impreſſit miro Ingenio, <hi>Petrus Paulus Porrus,</hi> genuae in Aedibus <hi>Nicolai Juſtiniani Pauli</hi> praeſidente Reipub. genuenſi pro Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſimo Franc. Rege praeſtanti viro <hi>Octaviano Fulgoſo,</hi> anno chriſtianae ſalutis milleſimo quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteſimo ſextodecimo menſe VIIIIbri. <hi>Petrus Paulus Porrus Mediolanenſi, Taurini</hi> degens.</note> Pentaglot pſalter of <hi>Auguſtin Juſtinian,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Nebo, anno</hi> 1516, in the houſe of <hi>Nicholas Juſtinian Paul,</hi> at <hi>Genoa.</hi> It was in <hi>Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldaic,</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> with the <hi>Latin</hi> verſions, gloſſes and Scholia, which laſt made the 8th column, in <hi>fol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SINCE I wrote this I have ſeen a fine copy of it upon vellum at my Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s, on which I ſhall venture to make the following obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0712300300:274"/>
THAT it is a compleat maſter-piece in that kind.</p>
                  <p>THE different diſpoſition of the columns are very regular and neat, and kept up to their exact proportions, nor having one double line in the <hi>Latin</hi> verſions, nor are any chaſms or white lines ſeen throughout the work; ſo that I dare affirm that to this time I have never ſeen a work ſo well contriv'd, and ſo completely finiſh'd. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is printed with all the points, both orthographical and muſical, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> is very neat, but above all the <hi>Arabic</hi> (allowing for its antiquity) ſurpaſſes all I have ever ſeen of the kind; and, that nothing may be wanting to compleat the whole, the preſs-work and ink, both rubricks and black, excels any thing I have ſeen, except <hi>Durand's Rationale,</hi> printed by the inventor, <hi>Fauſt,</hi> in 1459, which book I have alſo ſeen in my Lord's library.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Arabic</hi> was the firſt that was ever printed, and this the firſt piece of the bible that ever appear'd in ſo many languages; for that of <hi>Potken</hi> at <hi>Cologn</hi> was not publiſh'd till two years after, and wanted the <hi>Arabic.</hi> The reader might reaſonably imagine, that this work met with deſerv'd encouragement; yet the reverſe appears from the juſt complaints of the author. For <hi>F. le Long</hi> in his account of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglot bibles, p. 36, tells us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'that he <hi>(Juſtinian)</hi> caus'd no leſs than 2000 copies to be printed off, preſuming that ſuch a work would not only procure him a vaſt reputation, but likewiſe prove very gainful to him; the profits of which he deſign'd to beſtow upon ſome of his family who were then in want. He fancied that it would infallibly meet with a kind reception, and that all rich prelates and princes would think themſelves oblig'd to encourage it, and reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe and inable him to proceed with the other parts of the bible.'</q> For this he promis'd in his preface to the pſalter; and, about twenty years after, in his annals of the Republick of <hi>Genoa,</hi> he propos'd to add the whole old teſtament in all thoſe languages to the new one, which was preſerv'd there, done after the ſame manner; and this he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have perform'd, had he not been unfortunately drown'd in his paſſage to the iſle of <hi>Corſica</hi> the following year. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'But, continues <hi>Le Long,</hi> he <hi>(Juſtinian)</hi> was deceiv'd by his too great credulity;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0712300300:275"/>
every body applauded the work, but few proceeded further than that; ſcarce a fourth part of what he had printed was ſold off.'</q> He ſays afterwards, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'that, this pſalter being of no uſe to any except the learned, he found it impoſſible to reimburſe himſelf the expence he had been at; becauſe, beſides the 2000 copies upon paper, he had about fifty printed upon vellum, which he preſented to all the kings, whether Chriſtians or Infidels.'</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>'TIS well that the author's diſappointment did not diſcourage both him and others from attempting the like glorious performances: tho' we do not find any more works of that prelate in the oriental tongues, yet I have met with the following one printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> in 1516, which convinceth me, that he publiſh'd more of them, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that which is mention'd in it. It is entitl'd, <hi>Liber Job ad Hebraicam veritatem reſtitutus, duplici Latina verſione, una vulgata, altera ex Hebreo Auguſtini Juſtiniani,</hi> 4to, <hi>i. e.</hi> the book of <hi>Job</hi> reſtor'd to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text, with a double verſion of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the vulgate, and another from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> by <hi>Auguſtin Juſtinianus,</hi> 4to. But when and where <hi>Juſtinian</hi> printed the book of <hi>Job</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> I can no where find. As for <hi>Porrus,</hi> the Printer of the pſalter above mention'd, tho' he was paid by the Biſhop who employ'd him, yet 'tis probable he ventur'd no more upon that province; for we do not find that ever he printed any thing more in thoſe languages, tho' he return'd to <hi>Turin,</hi> and printed for ſeveral years after. His mark or rebus was a leak with a <hi>P</hi> on each ſide, alluding to his name <hi>Peter Paul Porrus,</hi> as was the cuſtom of that time to find ſome beaſt, bird, plant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that had analogy to the perſon's ſirname, in order to form a rebus; as appears from the table of them at the end of this book.</p>
                  <p>THE next conſiderable work is the bible of that great <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> printed at <hi>Alcala de Herares in Spain,</hi> in <hi>Latin Complutum,</hi> from whence it is call'd the <hi>Complutentian</hi> bible. But before we leave <hi>Italy,</hi> I ſhall juſt mention ſome other printers, who, tho' they did not excel in this kind, yet oblig'd the world with many noble volumes in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi> Of this number was <hi>Andreas Azulanus,</hi> father-in-law to the great <hi>Aldus</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> who
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0712300300:276"/>
ſucceeded him in that Printing-houſe, and kept up the credit of it for ſeveral years. His acquaintance with the members of the learned aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Aldus</hi>'s houſe, as well as with his other foreign correſpondents, and his own extraordinary learning enabled him to print many noble editions, which it is not my deſign to give an account of here, ſince they may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi>'s <hi>Annals,</hi> vol. II.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Junta</hi>'s at <hi>Florence,</hi> a noble family of Printers, ſome of whom we have ſpoken of under the heads of <hi>Florence, Rome, Venice</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> ſignaliz'd themſelves in the preceeding and this century; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe of <hi>Florence</hi> were famous for their beautiful and correct editions in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Lilly</hi> was their rebus, with this motto, <hi>Nil candidius,</hi> i. e. <hi>nothing is whiter;</hi> to which they ſometimes added the initial Letters of their names, and ſometimes printed them at length. There were two of them at <hi>Genoa,</hi> viz. <hi>Philip,</hi> who began to print in 1497, and continu'd till 1518, about which time he is ſuppos'd to have dy'd, and <hi>Bernard Junta,</hi> but whether a brother or kinſman to him I cannot determine. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer having cauſe to ſuſpect, that his works might be pirated, according to the cuſtom of thoſe times, obtain'd a patent from pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. of a ten years privilege for all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> editions, which he ſhould print from that time. As the former are all very curious and highly eſteem'd, I ſhall give a liſt of the moſt conſiderable of them, which is as follows.</p>

                  <p>THIS is the laſt book which he printed; the next, <hi>viz. Florilegium diverſorum epigrammatum,</hi> &amp;c. 8vo, being printed by his heirs.</p>
                  <p>I SHALL mention but one more Printing-houſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> viz. at the <hi>Quirinal-college</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the care of the famous <hi>Angel Gallotius,</hi> and protection of pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who was the founder of that college and Printing-houſe, and among other marks of his favour, gave them a privilege of ten years for all their impreſſions, ſome of which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fine and correct, and revis'd by the learned <hi>Conſtantine Laſcaris,</hi> often mention'd in this book; of which number were the <hi>Porphyri quaeſtiones Homericae &amp; de nympharum antro,</hi> &amp;c. and a very antient <hi>Latin</hi> tranſlation of <hi>Homer,</hi> both printed in 1517. <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s Scholiaſt, 1518, and others of great value.</p>
                  <p>I SHALL now return to that famous bible of cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> as I hinted before, commonly call'd the <hi>Complutenſian</hi> bible, which is the only conſiderable one publiſh'd, either in <hi>Spain</hi> or any other part of <hi>Europe</hi> before that time. It conſiſts of ſix large volumes in fol. the firſt of which contains the new teſtament in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> finiſh'd in 1517; the ſecond is a <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> vocabulary of all the old teſtament with ſome other diſſertations, finiſh'd <hi>May</hi> 31, 1515; the third is the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Chaldee,</hi> with a <hi>Latin</hi> verſion of each; the fourth is a ſecond part of the old teſtament, and contains the books of <hi>Joſhua, Judges</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> the two books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> with the prayer of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> with their <hi>Latin</hi> verſion; the fifth is the third part of the old teſtament in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> with the <hi>Latin</hi> verſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the books of <hi>Eſdras, Nehemiah, Heſter, Job,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms, Proverbs, Eccleſiaſtes, Canticles, Wiſdom of Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal part of <hi>Heſter</hi> only in <hi>Greek;</hi> the ſixth is the fourth and laſt part of the old teſtament in the ſame languages as the former, and contains the prophecies of <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> with the <hi>Lamentations</hi> at the end, <hi>Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel</hi> (with the hiſtory of <hi>Suſannah,</hi> and of <hi>Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dragon) Hoſea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Michah, Nahum, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi,</hi> with the three books of the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> theſe four laſt volumes were finiſh'd <hi>ann.</hi> 1517, <hi>July</hi>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0712300300:278"/>
the 10th; tho' Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> ſays, that the whole ſix volumes were not publiſh'd till the year 1520. Every page both of the old and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is divided into three columns: in the old, the firſt column contains the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text; the middle the vulgate <hi>Latin;</hi> and the third the <hi>Greek</hi> of the <hi>Septuagint:</hi> beſides the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> which is plac'd in the inner margin with the verſion of it oppoſite to it. The vulgate is printed with <hi>Gothic</hi> letter.</p>
                  <p>THE only objection againſt this work is, that the Printers made uſe of a ſort of falſe letter to fill up the ſpaces, whenever any of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions run to a greater length than the text; that there might be no line ſhorter than another, nor any blank ſpaces in the column. The new teſtament is in a very plain large character, without ligatures, abbreviations or accents; tho' that of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> is different; the reaſon of which they give in the preface, to the following purport; that ſince all the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> authors, whether ſacred or profane, were originally written without them, they were unwilling to introduce any thing into thoſe holy books, which it is certain was neither origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in them, nor of any uſe towards the underſtanding of them; but with reſpect to the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which is but a tranſlation, they thought it unneceſſary to be too ſcrupulous about it.</p>
                  <p>THIS work was printed by <hi>Arnold William de Bracario,</hi> in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Alcala de Henares</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> at the charges and under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of that learned prelate, whoſe merit in this reſpect can never be ſufficiently extoll'd. <hi>Alphonſus Zamora</hi> tells us, that he gave no leſs than four thouſand crowns of gold for ſeven <hi>Hebrew</hi> manuſcripts; and it would be difficult to determine the ſums, which the <hi>Greek, Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> manuſcripts coſt him. As for the learned men, whom he ſent for from all parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> to aſſiſt him in this undertaking, <hi>Malincrot</hi> tells us they were very numerous, of whom we ſhall mention ſome. Among the <hi>Greeks</hi> were <hi>Demetrius Cretenſis, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony Nebriſſenus, Lopes de Aſtuniga,</hi> and <hi>Terdianus Pintianus,</hi> who were all profeſſors of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues, and famous for their works. Of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> profeſſors were <hi>Alphonſus Medicus,</hi> a native of <hi>Alcala, Paul Coronellus, Alphonſus Zamorali</hi> and <hi>John Vergera,</hi> to the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0712300300:279"/>
laſt of whom was committed the tranſlation of ſeveral books, in which he reſtor'd a great number of texts, which were wholly unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible in the vulgate <hi>Latin.</hi> Theſe, with many of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men of the univerſity of <hi>Alcala,</hi> were engag'd by the Cardinal with very large ſalaries in this work, for the ſpace of 15 years, <hi>viz.</hi> from 1502 to 1517; ſoon after which he was prevented by death from executing ſeveral other glorious deſigns. A larger account of this work may be ſeen in <hi>Malincrot,</hi> p. 110. and Mr. <hi>Mattaire's Annals,</hi> p. 124, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHILE I am upon the ſubject of Polyglots, I muſt not omit one great advantage which the art receiv'd from it, and which it hitherto wanted, <hi>viz.</hi> that of printing in columns, by which the text and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are ſo eaſily diſpos'd, that the reader may at one view ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any ſcruple, that may ariſe either from a word wrong printed, or miſunderſtood in the one, by caſting his eye immediately on the other. This is particularly neceſſary in <hi>Greek</hi> works and their verſions; in which when there happens to be ſome fault of impreſſion, as 'tis almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible both text and verſion ſhould be faulty in the ſame word, the one may be eaſily corrected by the other. <hi>Chevillier</hi> gives us many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtances of this, from pag. 240 to 243. I ſhall only mention one of them, in which the Printer or corrector makes <hi>Aelian</hi> call all the greateſt and nobleſt men of <hi>Greece</hi> errant lyars thro' every part of their lives <hi>[omnes Graecorum clariſſimi proeſtantiſſimique viri per totam vitam in extrema mendacitate verſati ſunt]</hi> a reproach which neither the author nor tranſlator ever dream'd of fixing upon that nation. But upon a careful examination of the <hi>Greek</hi> text, the word appears to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it ſhould have been printed <hi>mendicitate,</hi> i. e. <hi>Poverty,</hi> inſtead of <hi>mendacitate</hi> [lying] which eſcap'd the corrector's obſervation.</p>
                  <p>THERE is another conveniency in this method, <hi>viz.</hi> that it obliges a tranſlator to be more conciſe, and to paraphraſe leſs, ſince the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant length of his verſion would be viſible at firſt ſight. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice of <hi>Aldus</hi>'s method of Printing the text in one page, and the verſion in the other; but he was not follow'd in it by any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I know of: whereas as ſoon as they had taken the hint of theſe columns from the Polyglot pſalter and bible, it was immediately
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0712300300:280"/>
follow'd by moſt Printers; and the famous <hi>Badius,</hi> in his edition of <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Politianus</hi>'s works, <hi>anno</hi> 1519, printed all the epigrams and verſions after this manner. How plain ſoever the advantages of this method may ſeem, yet ſeveral men of learning have decry'd it; and particularly <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony Muretus</hi> and <hi>Joſ. Scaliger</hi> have complain'd, that this way of printing the <hi>Greek</hi> and the verſion in two columns had been the cauſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being wholly neglected.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES books in two languages, the columns are very neceſſary in large folio's, and ſometimes in large quarto's, where the lines run to ſo great a length, that they puzzle the reader, who is apt to read the ſame line over again, or perhaps to ſkip the next, unleſs he conſtantly keep his finger moving from one to the other; which is eaſily remedied by dividing the pages into two columns. This method has obtain'd almoſt from the middle of the 15th century, and is entirely owing to that of printing the ſacred books in ſeveral languages and columns. This ſhall ſuffice concerning this work printed in <hi>Spain;</hi> in which I find but two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more of any note, <hi>viz. John Peter Bonhomin</hi> at <hi>Lisbon, anno</hi> 1514, where he printed a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> book, entitled <hi>Ordinationes,</hi> &amp;c. fol. in <hi>Gothic;</hi> and <hi>John de Porris</hi> at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> perhaps a relation of <hi>Peter Paul Porrus,</hi> who printed the pſalter at <hi>Genoa,</hi> mention'd before.</p>
                  <p>I COME now to ſpeak of the French Printers, whoſe merit, tho' late, became at leaſt equal with that of <hi>Italy,</hi> or any other kingdom, in all reſpects. <hi>Henry Meibomius,</hi> a German hiſtorian, owns, <note n="1" place="bottom">—quod ſcribendi genus ut <hi>Moguntiae</hi> in <hi>Germania</hi> inventum, ita apud <hi>Italos</hi> excultum, &amp; in <hi>Gallia</hi> demum perſectum eſt. <hi>Chronic. Riddaggbuſenſ.</hi> Tom. 3. p. 380.</note>, <hi>that the Art of Printing, which was invented at</hi> Mentz <hi>in</hi> Germany, <hi>and improv'd in</hi> Italy, <hi>was at laſt perfected in</hi> France: which is ſufficiently evident from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> were there no other Printers to be produc'd in favour of that kingdom. But this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has given greater encouragement, or abounded more in excellent Printers, than that; and conſidering the care the univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe power and authority over Printers and bookſellers we have given an account of under the article of <hi>Paris,</hi> had continually over them, and the many ſignal marks of their favour, join'd to the genius of the nation, we ſhall not wonder at the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fection which they brought the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0712300300:281"/>
art to, tho' ſomewhat later than their neighbours. For we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Badius,</hi> one of the firſt who ſignaliz'd himſelf in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, did not begin to print till almoſt the cloſe of the laſt century, nor come to <hi>Paris</hi> till the beginning of this. Hitherto, tho' the <hi>Roman</hi> character, and the elegant manner of printing introduc'd by the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, were here exactly imitated, and in ſome caſes excell'd; yet with reſpect to the learned languages, eſpecially the Eaſtern, they were much neglected throughout <hi>France;</hi> and tho' the noble <hi>Greek</hi> impreſſions of <hi>Aldus,</hi> had rais'd an univerſal deſire of reviving that tongue, yet the French were backward in introducing it, till they began to be contemn'd by the Italians, who were become every where maſters of it. The only pieces printed by them in that tongue till that time, were ſome quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo wretchedly perform'd, that Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> tells us, they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be gueſs'd at than read. The character was rude and uncooth, without accents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which <hi>Badius</hi> makes an apology, and deſires his readers to impute thoſe errors and omiſſions to the ſcarcity of types, and want of compoſitors who underſtood in that language. <hi>Franc. Tiſſard,</hi> a perſon compleatly ſkill'd in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and qualify'd for ſuch a taſk, reviv'd thoſe tongues, and prevail'd upon the Pariſian Printers to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, having printed ſeveral books in thoſe languages: whereas before this the expence of importing them from <hi>Venice</hi> was ſo great, that it deterr'd many from the ſtudy of them. At firſt he addreſs'd a pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic diſcourſe to the ſcholars of <hi>Paris</hi> upon that ſubject; in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents how contemptible their neighbours in <hi>Italy</hi> thought them; what epithets they gave their nation, ſuch as, barbarous, proud and ignorant, who pretended to give laws to <hi>Italy,</hi> the moſt learned and polite nation of the world, whilſt themſelves were not contented to deſpiſe the muſes at home, but muſt make excurſions over the <hi>Alps,</hi> to diſturb them in their belov'd abodes there. He exhorted them to retrieve the honour of their country, and to apply themſelves immediately to the ſtudy of thoſe languages; he promis'd them his own and other learned men's aſſiſtance; and tells them, that he had caus'd ſome <hi>Greek</hi> books to be printed, which, tho' cheap, would be great helps to them in that ſtudy. In ſhort, he laid before them ſuch powerful motives, and convincing arguments, that he at length rais'd a deſire in them of rivalling their neighbours for
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0712300300:282"/>
learning. His extraordinary merit ſoon procur'd him the eſteem and friendſhip of the great, who jointly aſſiſted this noble deſign; among whom was the duke <hi>de Valois,</hi> afterwards king of <hi>France,</hi> and ſufficiently known by the name of <hi>Francis</hi> I. the great patron of learning, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him into his family and protection.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt <hi>Greek</hi> book which <hi>Tiſſard</hi> caus'd to be printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> was entitled <gap reason="foreign">

grammar with a <hi>Greek</hi> alphabet, and ſome hymns in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> at the end; which book he dedicated to his great patron <hi>Francis</hi> prince <hi>de Valois. Giles Gourmont,</hi> who had printed his <hi>Greek</hi> works, likewiſe undertook the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> It is printed with his name; and tho' there is no date to it, yet it is plain it was publiſh'a in the year aforemention'd. However as he was the firſt who merited the title of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> printer to the city and univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and has publiſh'd ſeveral other <hi>Greek</hi> works after the year 1508, <hi>viz.</hi> the Idyls of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> ſome of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>'s works, a ſecond edition of <hi>Chryſolaras</hi>'s grammar in 1511, the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologia</hi> and <hi>Aldus</hi>'s <hi>Greek Lexicon</hi> of 1497 much enlarg'd in 1512, the <hi>Grammar</hi> of <hi>Theod. Gaza</hi> in 1516, &amp;c. I thought my ſelf oblig'd to do juſtice to his merit. He us'd to put his coat of arms at the beginning or end of his books, and ſometimes at both, with this French motto; <hi>Toſt ou tard, pres ou loing, a le fort du foible beſoing,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſooner or later, far or near, the ſtrong ſtand in need of the weak,</hi> with his name <hi>Giles</hi> or <hi>Aegidius Gourmont.</hi> His mark ſometimes was the three crowns of the Kings of <hi>Cologn</hi> with the 25th verſe of the 37th pſalm; <hi>I have been young, and now am old,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> under them. He liv'd overagainſt the college of <hi>Cambray,</hi> in the ſquare of that name; and his books are much valu'd by the lovers of antiquity, eſpecially at <hi>Paris.</hi> He continu'd printing till after the year 1527. As for the learned <hi>Tiſſard,</hi> as we find nothing printed by him, after his <hi>Hebrew</hi> grammar, he is ſuppos'd to have dy'd about that time.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER, he did not want a ſucceſſor of equal merit to carry on this work; for <hi>Jerom Aleander,</hi> a perſon ſo well ſkill'd in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as to ſpeak them with as much fluency as his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, was ſent for by <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. from <hi>Italy,</hi> where he profeſs'd the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues with univerſal applauſe. His reputation was ſo great, that the elector <hi>Palatine</hi> ſent his own brother <hi>Wolfgang de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> to be inſtructed by him, and the learned <hi>Vatablus,</hi> who had been formerly his ſcholar, was proud to aſſiſt him in ſome of his works, and take care of their correction, whenever <hi>Aleander</hi> was hinder'd by ſickneſs or avocations. As ſoon as he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he employ'd <hi>Gourmont</hi>'s preſſes in printing thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> works which we mention'd juſt before in ſpeaking of that Printer. The King fail'd not of giving
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0712300300:284"/>
him immediate encouragement; for he ſettled on him a penſion of 500 crowns of gold, with many other marks of his favour; ſo that he was choſen principal of the college of the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> and, in 1512, rector of the unverſity, with general applauſe; tho' he had not yet taken his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's degree there. At laſt he was made library-keeper to the pope, a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and nuncio, and then cardinal, by <hi>Clement</hi> VII. I ſhall only add, that he was one of <hi>Aldus</hi>'s learned academy; and that under his care the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongues were ſo well ſettled in <hi>France,</hi> as to flouriſh there ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>BUT it muſt be own'd, that thoſe editions of <hi>Gourmont</hi> were very far from perfection, ſince the types were ill ſhap'd, the punches ill fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and the matrices worſe ſunk; beſides which defects they had not caſt a ſufficient font of types, and were for that reaſon oblig'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſtop till a form was work'd off and diſtributed, before they could go on. Another defect in thoſe types was, that the accents not being caſt to place between the letters as now, but by themſelves, and ſo compos'd in intermediate lines, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> points are done at this time, they were often plac'd over the wrong letters, and frequently confounded one for another, thro' the unskilfulneſs of their compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors. <hi>Tiſſard</hi> complains of this more than once, but tells his readers, that they were taking all proper means to remedy thoſe defects; and hopes in time, that thoſe characters would be brought to as great a perfection there, as in <hi>Italy.</hi> And indeed we find that the ſucceſs of <hi>Gourmont</hi>'s impreſſions, under all theſe diſadvantages, excited other printers in that city, to procure better types, workmen, correctors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (not to mention that beautiful font of ſmall <hi>Greek</hi> which king <hi>Francis</hi> I. caus'd to be caſt at his own charge) in which they ſucceeded to admiration, and ſoon publiſh'd much finer editions than thoſe of <hi>Gourmont.</hi> We ſhall only mention ſome of the moſt conſiderable, tho' they all came out later than 1520, except <hi>Angelus Politianus</hi>'s epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, printed by <hi>Badius</hi> in 1519, already ſpoken of in this chapter; and his edition of <hi>Guillelmus Budaeus's Greek</hi> epiſtles, 4to, in 1520. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, <hi>Peter Vidoue,</hi> or <hi>Vidaeus,</hi> maſter of arts, and an eminent printer, printed <hi>Berault's Greek</hi> lexicon in fol. and <hi>Or. Apollo's Hieroglyphics,</hi> 8vo, in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> in 1521 and 1523. <hi>Gourmont</hi> printed <hi>Homer</hi>'s firſt
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0712300300:285"/>
and ſecond <hi>Iliad,</hi> 4to, with <hi>Wolmar</hi>'s ſhort notes; and the <hi>Greek</hi> lexicon of <hi>Magnus Chaeredamus;</hi> and in 1527, <hi>Gwinler's Greek</hi> ſyntax, 8vo. <hi>Anno</hi> 1528 <hi>Simon Colinaeus,</hi> or <hi>de Colines,</hi> printed <hi>Sophocles</hi> tragedies, and in 1534, the new teſtament. Theſe, with a few inconſiderable ones more, were all that came out in <hi>Greek</hi> during the ſpace of 27 years, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Tiſſard</hi>'s firſt impreſſion in 1507 to 1534; which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd here, tho' they run beyond our period, to ſhew how ſlow their firſt progreſs was, tho' their advances afterwards were prodigious. <hi>Chevilier,</hi> from whoſe liſt I have extracted the beſt part of theſe edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, has carry'd it on to the year 1560; and the reader will find, both in this piece and the remainder of it, ſeveral remarkable works omitted by <hi>Mr. Mattaire</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> particularly the <hi>Greek</hi> lexicon and the new teſtament above nam'd. However as <hi>Chevilier</hi> tells us, that he ſaw them all in the <hi>Sorbon</hi> library, I thought proper to mention them.</p>
                  <p>THE reader perhaps will be ſurpriz'd to find nothing attempted by the Parifians in the polyglot way, whilſt the Italians, Germans and Spaniards ſet them ſo fair an example. But, whatever be the reaſon of this neglect, 'tis certain, that if we except the <hi>Pſalterium quincuplex</hi> of <hi>Mr. Faber,</hi> or <hi>Fabry,</hi> printed in fol. 1509, by <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> in <hi>Hebrew, Latin</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> with the <hi>Pſalterium vetus &amp; conciliatum,</hi> in five co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, and reprinted by him in 1513, and again at <hi>Caen [Cadomi]</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> by <hi>Peter Olivier,</hi> in 1515, I can find nothing of that kind during the greateſt part of this century. However, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd they have made the world ample amends in the next, in which <hi>Antony Vitré</hi> printed that noble work, known by the name of <hi>Monſieur le Jay</hi>'s polyglot bible in 1657; which being of too late a date, and ſo well known to the learned, I ſhall only ſay of it, that as ſar as relates to the Printing part, (for as to the author's merit with reſpect to learning, 'tis not my province to enquire into) it has not yet been equall'd by any work publiſh'd, in any nation, either for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of character or elegancy of diſpoſition, fineneſs of paper or richneſs of embelliſhment; in all which <hi>Mr. le Jay,</hi> who was at the charges of the impreſſion, ſpar'd neither coſt nor labour, in order to render it a maſter piece of that kind. Here I muſt draw a veil over my own
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0712300300:286"/>
country, which is greatly injur'd, if it did not contribute to the ruin of the undertaker of this glorious work. An intimate friend at <hi>Paris</hi> ſent me word, that the ſheets of Mr. <hi>le Jay</hi>'s Polyglot was unfairly procur'd from the preſs at <hi>Paris</hi> before the work was publiſh'd, and, by the editor's of the Engliſh Polyglot, improv'd and publiſh'd ſo ſoon after, as to reduce Mr. <hi>le Jay</hi> almoſt to want; after his having expended above 5000 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling to compleat his work. But, as 'tis unpleaſant to relate, I ſhall proceed.</p>
                  <p>As for the other printers who flouriſh'd at <hi>Paris</hi> during this ſpace of 20 years, ſince my deſign is only to mention thoſe who were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for improvements, unattempted in the former century, I have but few to add to the preceeding. The firſt in rank and merit is <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> the father of that numerous family of Printers, whoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and impreſſions for near 200 years have been celebrated by much better pens, and particularly by <hi>Mr. Bayle</hi> and <hi>Theod. Janſon</hi> abroad, and by <hi>Mr. Nichols, Collier,</hi> but much more fully by the laborious and learned <hi>Mr. Mattaire,</hi> in his <hi>Vitae Stephanorum</hi> and <hi>Annales Typograph.</hi> I ſhall therefore content my ſelf with giving a ſhort account of their great progenitor <hi>Henry,</hi> as far as relates to my preſent ſubject. He began to exerciſe the Art of Printing about 1502, in company with <hi>Wolfgang Hopyl,</hi> a noted <hi>German</hi> Printer at <hi>Paris,</hi> of whom we have given an account in the foregoing century. He had afterwards ſeveral other partners, <hi>viz. John Petit, Dennis Roce, John de Brié</hi> and <hi>John Hongel,</hi> all eminent Printers. We have already ſpoken of his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglot Pſalter,</hi> which, for ought I find, was the only piece he did in that way. As for the <hi>Greek,</hi> it was ſo little in vogue in his time, that he printed but little in it. He us'd two ſorts of characters for the <hi>Latin,</hi> viz the <hi>Gothic</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> both good in their kind. It were, ſuperfluous to tell the reader, that he was a man of great ſkill in the learned languages, and wrote ſeveral curious pieces in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Latin.</hi> He was extremely correct in his editions, ſo that their faults are ſo few, as ſcarce to deſerve an errata; yet he always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledg'd the ſmalleſt number of them, as appears from his edition of <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s apology againſt <hi>Latomus,</hi> in which he confeſſes,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0712300300:287"/>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Locis aliquot incuria noſtra aberratum eſt.</note> 
                     <hi>that ſome ſaults eſcap'd him thro' neglect;</hi> tho' the whole was but twenty. Hi chief correctors were <hi>Peter Porta, Volgatius Pratenſis, John Solidus</hi> of <hi>Cracow</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Beatus Rhenanus.</hi> As he was ſworn Printer of the city of <hi>Paris,</hi> inſtead of a mark or rebus, he us'd to put the arms of that univerſity to his impreſſions, which is the eſcutcheon of <hi>France,</hi> with a hand from the clouds holding a book. Several other printers of that city follow'd his example in this. He dy'd in 1520, leaving among other children three ſons, who became very eminent, <hi>vid. Mattaire Vit. Steph.</hi> the two firſt <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> in printing, and <hi>Charles</hi> in phyſick.</p>
                  <p>HIS ſucceſſor was <hi>Simon de Colines,</hi> or <hi>Colinaeus,</hi> who marry'd his relict, and educated his two ſons before mention'd; and with them rais'd the reputation of his Printing-houſe higher, than their father could, whilſt the learned languages were in their infancy there. I ſhall only add, that <hi>Robert</hi> became ſo great a proficient under his father and father-in-law, that he was able to manage that great Printing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe at the age of 18; and that one of his editions of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in 16<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>ann,</hi> 1549, printed in a very fine <hi>Greek</hi> character, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcarce, is affirm'd to be without a fault. This deſerves notice, becauſe there is another of his likewiſe in 16<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, 1546, which has an errata at the end, and is frequently ſold for the other. I cannot but obſerve, that to this <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> we owe the invention of dividing the chapters of the bible into verſes, found out by him on a journey from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lyons,</hi> as we are inform'd by <hi>Theod. Janſon de Vit. Stephanorum,</hi> printed at <hi>Amſterdam ann.</hi> 1643, pag. 48; the great advantage of which is obvious to every perſon.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs the city of <hi>Paris,</hi> I cannot forbear mentioning a moſt curious and elaborate work, which tho' not printed till the year 1529, yet, both for its ſingularity and its having been begun many years before, ought by no means to be omitted, I mean the book entitled <hi>Champ-Fleury,</hi> written by the famous <hi>Godfrey Tory,</hi> printer and bookſeller of the city of <hi>Bourges,</hi> at the ſign of the broken pitcher, and printed by <hi>Giles Gourmont</hi> likewiſe, Printer and bookſeller at <hi>Paris,</hi> under the following title;</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>THE author, who for his learning had been ſome time before choſen preſident of a college in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and had tranſlated and publiſh'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral learned works out of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> ever ſince the year 1512, was afterwards admitted ſworn Printer and bookſeller to the king, and to the univerſity of <hi>Paris;</hi> but became moſt famous for the curious work abovemention'd; in which he endeavours to demonſtrate the due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of letters from thoſe of a human body and face, as appears by the title. As it would ſpin this chapter to too great a length, were I to give the reader a more particular account of this ſcarce and ſingular piece, I ſhall content my ſelf with referring him to Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi>'s <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales Typogr.</hi> vol. II. part 2. from page 550 to 559, where he will find ſuch particularities both of the book and its author, as he will think worth reading, if he has any taſte in this way.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE already dwelt ſo long upon the ſubject of Polyglots, the moſt conſiderable improvement of the Art in this century; and upon the city of <hi>Paris,</hi> the moſt celebrated in <hi>France</hi> for productions of that kind; that I ſhall ſcarce have room to ſpeak of <hi>Lyons, Rouen, Tholouſe, Caen,</hi> &amp;c. which have produc'd many excellent works, if not in the Polyglot way, yet in all branches of the Art. I ſhall confine my ſelf therefore to thoſe Printers who have cultivated the <hi>Greek</hi> or Oriental tongues, and refer the reſt to Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi>'s <hi>Annals,</hi> where the reader may ſee their merit, and the liſt of their impreſſions.</p>
                  <p>THE city of <hi>Lyons</hi> has been always the next in rank to <hi>Paris,</hi> in every branch of Printing; and if we conſider that it receiv'd leſs encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their princes and the learned, the latter chuſing to reſide at <hi>Paris,</hi> where there was a greater probability of advancement, we ſhall wonder that <hi>Lyons</hi> was ſo little inferior to <hi>Paris;</hi> and may remember, that it produc'd many valuable impreſſions during the laſt century. However, the reader muſt not expect any productions in <hi>Greek,</hi> much leſs in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the Polyglot kind, during theſe 20 years, or long after, ſince he has ſeen the ſlow progreſs of thoſe languages at <hi>Paris;</hi> and with reſpect to the <hi>Latin</hi> and modern tongues, they are foreign to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0712300300:289"/>
purpoſe. I ſhall therefore only ſay, that the <hi>Lyons</hi> Printers publiſh'd many editions of the claſſics, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> law-books, and eſpecially <hi>Latin</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, there being ſcarce a year paſt for a long time, in which they did not print two or three of them of different verſions, and ſome with very fine rubricks and other curious embelliſhments. The moſt remarkable Printers of them were <hi>James Sacon,</hi> or <hi>Sachon,</hi> who printed ſome works of the fathers, and one time two <hi>Latin</hi> bibles in one year; <hi>James Mareſchall, John Moylin</hi> and <hi>Nicholas de Benedictis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE city of <hi>Rouen,</hi> in <hi>Latin Rothomagium,</hi> and <hi>Caen</hi> follow next: but their productions for theſe twenty years, and after, are ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if we except a <hi>Latin</hi> bible in 4to, <hi>anno</hi> 1511, and the <hi>Pſalterium quincuplex</hi> of <hi>Faber</hi> aforemention'd, which was printed in the latter <hi>anno</hi> 1515, both by <hi>Peter Olivier,</hi> and a <hi>Latin</hi> bible in the former; that I ſhall inſiſt no longer upon them. With reſpect to the other cities of <hi>France,</hi> which receiv'd the Art either before or after the cloſe of the laſt century, their impreſſions are ſtill leſs conſiderable. I now paſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the reader will be ſurpriz'd to ſee the Art rather ſunk and loſt than improv'd. In the preceeding cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury we find ſeveral cities in <hi>Holland,</hi> as <hi>Utrecht</hi> 1473, <hi>Delph</hi> 1477, <hi>Goude</hi> 1479, <hi>Harlem</hi> 1485, and <hi>Leyden</hi> 1497, receiv'd and cultivated the Art; yet now we meet not with a ſingle edition done in any of them; nor find that any other city receiv'd it during thoſe twenty years. As for <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> 'tis manifeſt they have been leſs neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent than the <hi>Dutch;</hi> for the city of <hi>Antwerp</hi> entertain'd one or two Printers, who publiſh'd three or four books during this ſpace; the moſt conſiderable of which was the new Teſtament in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> in 4to, <hi>anno</hi> 1509; and the univerſity of <hi>Louvain</hi> had an eminent Printer, <hi>Theodore Martin,</hi> who, having printed at his own native town of <hi>Aloſt</hi> 'till the end of the 15th century, remov'd to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd ſome <hi>Latin</hi> editions, and at length came hither and continued prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting till 1528, or perhaps longer. His impreſſions in this city are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very remarkable for their bulk, beauty or number. I find but nine or ten, moſt of which are ſchool-books, either written or publiſh'd by <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> yet his moſt conſiderable work is the <hi>Latin</hi> teſtament in 8vo, <hi>anno</hi> 1519, if it was printed by him, as is probable, ſince we find
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0712300300:290"/>
no other Printer here during this ſpace, tho' <hi>F. le Long</hi> mentions not the Printer's name.</p>
                  <p>AS for the other cities, which receiv'd the Art before 1500, as <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Aloſt, Bruſſels, Gaunt, Boiſleduc,</hi> &amp;c. we find ſo profound a ſilence among the annaliſts and hiſtorians, as makes me ſuſpect that it either ceas'd entirely there, or that their produce was not worth preſerving, unleſs we ſuppoſe that they were loſt in the war, of which this country was the ſeat in thoſe times; which is evidently the caſe of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, eſpecially of thoſe upon the <hi>Rhine, Switzerland,</hi> &amp;c. Some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent authors have told us, that they purchas'd ſome of thoſe valuable pieces, which had been plunder'd by the ſoldiers, during the wars, out of the libraries of the monks and others. If this be fact, 'tis ſtrange that <hi>Louvain,</hi> which calls itſelf the <hi>maiden city,</hi> becauſe it was never taken by any foreign power, ſhould not have preſerv'd ſome more valuable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions than thoſe of <hi>Theod. Martin,</hi> juſt mention'd. However, to do juſtice to the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> eſpecially, I muſt ſay, that how negligent ſoever they were at firſt in this reſpect, they have ſufficiently oblig'd the world ſince by their improvements to this Art; nor need I tell the reader how much they have excell'd the Engliſh in the goodneſs of their paper, beauty and variety of characters, and in elegance and correctneſs of compoſition; in ſhort, how they have equall'd any nation of <hi>Europe</hi> in every branch of Printing ſince. In the ſecond volume we ſhall ſhew what improvements they have made to the mechanic part of it, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Printing-preſs, chaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the former of which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, as ſcarce to admit a greater degree of perfection.</p>
                  <p>HERE I cannot but obſerve the ſtrange viciſſitudes that have attended this Art ſince its firſt invention. We have ſeen how diligent the Italian nation has been in improving it, what quick progreſs they made in it, and to what a degree of perfection they brought it even before the cloſe of the 15th century; whereas ſcarce any nation in <hi>Europe</hi> has neglected it more within theſe hundred years, having ſuffer'd their elegant Roman and Italick to degenerate, and are become very careleſs in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ornaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that they are almoſt inferior to any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in all the branches of Printing. The French, on the contrary, who did not introduce the fine <hi>Venetian Roman, Italick,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> 'till late in the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0712300300:291"/>
16th century, have been allow'd the beſt Printers, 'till <hi>Elzevir</hi> aroſe; ſince which time the Dutch, who were by far the lateſt of any nation in <hi>Europe</hi> in bringing it to the perfection which their neighbours had, have been lately ſuperior to all. I ſhall ſay but little of <hi>England,</hi> where every reader is already ſenſible what rank our Printers here deſerve with reſpect to other countries; but 'tis with the utmoſt regret that I obſerve our nation, which took ſo much pains to have the Art brought over in its earlieſt days, and cultivated it with ſo much application, ſhould have been ſo far excell'd by the French and Dutch Printers, and even by thoſe of our own nation, who liv'd a century and a half ago. But were the reader conſcious of the diſadvantages we labour under, and the ſmall Profit we reap from our labour, he would rather be apt to wonder that any of us have been able to keep it up to that degree of perfection it is ſtill in. I could eaſily make it appear from whence theſe difficulties ariſe. This complaint, which is far from being new, the <hi>Latin</hi> reader will find ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly expreſs'd above 150 years ago by <hi>Cornelius Kelian,</hi> one of the great <hi>Plantine</hi>'s correctors, in an epigram of ſixteen verſes, which I have ſubjoin'd at the bottom of the page <note n="1" place="bottom">

But it muſt not be ſuppos'd that the <hi>Turks</hi> invited them or any other Printers thither, much leſs that they gave them any other encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement than a large toleration. On the contrary, we have ſhewn in a former chapter, how Sultan <hi>Bajazet</hi> II. publiſh'd an edict in 1483, againſt the uſe of printed books under pain of death; which edict was afterwards confirm'd by <hi>Selim</hi> I. his ſon. The encouragement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they receiv'd was from the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Jews;</hi> the latter undoubtedly were pleas'd to have their own books at a more moderate rate, than when they were only tranſcrib'd; and the former, being willing not only to have the old Teſtament printed by them more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect than the editions of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Printers, but likewiſe to have it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd among the <hi>Turks, Indians,</hi> &amp;c. who were wholly ignorant of thoſe important truths contain'd in it, ſpar'd no coſt to purchaſe them. Beſides this, their <hi>Targums, Talmud,</hi> and other <hi>Rabbinical</hi> learning were brought up by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to furniſh themſelves with what arguments they cou'd, againſt that poor infatuated people, out of their own books. And perhaps this might be the main motive which induc'd thoſe two Sultans to publiſh ſo ſevere an edict againſt printing any books in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> language, ſince the averſion of that nation to almoſt every branch of learning, and eſpecially the religious, is ſufficiently known.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE already tranſgreſs'd my propos'd limits, as often as the life of any eminent Printer has extended beyond them, or any material occurrence happen'd worthy of the reader's notice. Agreeable to which liberty, I ſhall now cloſe this chapter with ſome remarks on the ſucceſs which attended the art, tho' at ſome diſtance of time from the year 1520. Firſt 'tis obſervable, that it has extended itſelf to <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> not indeed at the invitation of the natives, eſpecially of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0712300300:294"/>
                     <hi>America,</hi> but by means of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and particularly of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> miſſionaries; who carry'd it to the latter for their ends, where it has throve, tho' not flouriſh'd ever ſince. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſociety <hi>de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagando fide,</hi> gives us an account of printing-houſes being ſet up in the cities of <hi>Goa, Rachol,</hi> in the country of <hi>Salſetta, Manella,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of the <hi>Philippine</hi> iſlands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the firſt of which were printed the two following works, <hi>viz. Doctrina Chriſtiana lingua Malabarica Tamul et litteris Malabaris in collegio Goano,</hi> 1577. This edition was in <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s poſſeſſion, and is now among thoſe which he bequeath'd to the univerſity of <hi>Leyden.</hi> The other is part of <hi>Confucius</hi>'s works printed likewiſe at <hi>Goa</hi> in 1569; a copy of which is now in the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's library at <hi>Vienna.</hi> We find alſo ſome printing-houſes ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time in the city of <hi>Lima,</hi> capital of the empire of <hi>Peru,</hi> and in ſeveral cities of the kingdom of <hi>Mexico.</hi> I ſhall only add, that our honourable ſociety for the propagation of the goſpel in foreign parts, having heard of the good ſucceſs, which Mr. <hi>Zidgenbalgh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grundler,</hi> two <hi>Daniſh</hi> miſſionaries, ſent to the coaſt of <hi>Tanquebar</hi> by his <hi>Daniſh</hi> majeſty, had in converting a great number of the natives of that country to the chriſtian faith, were pleas'd to ſend them the whole apparatus of a printing-houſe, with proper workmen and large quantities of paper, which they thankfully receiv'd, and immediately ſet to work, having ſince printed a fine quarto New Teſtament, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-books, catechiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and ſeveral eaſtern languages and characters, for the promoting of their pious deſign.</p>
                  <p>To return again to <hi>Europe,</hi> the Printers, who firſt introduc'd the art into <hi>Muſcovy</hi> about 1560, were leſs ſucceſsful. That nation was too little friendly to learning to give it any encourgement; and even ſuffer'd both the printing-houſe and its whole apparatus to be burn'd and deſtroy'd, without ever enquiring after the authors of the miſchief. The famous <hi>Thevet,</hi> hiſtoriographer to <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> and a great traveller, gives us the following account of it: <q rend="inline margQuotes">'As for the Art of Printing, they (the <hi>Muſcovites)</hi> had not the uſe of it till 1560; when it was diſcover'd to them by a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> merchant, who bought a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of types, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which many neat editions were printed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, as they are a very ſuperſtitious nation, and apt to raiſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0712300300:295"/>
without any foundation, in which they imitate their followers of the <hi>Greek</hi> church; ſome of them hir'd ſeveral fellows privately to burn all their characters, apprehending that printing might make ſome change or confuſion in their religion. And yet not the leaſt enquiry or proſecution was made after this, either by the prince or his Subjects.'</q> But ſince that time they have admitted it into their metropolis of <hi>Moſcow,</hi> and elſewhere in the laſt century, tho' they print but little, and ſell at exceſſive rates.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE already hinted, that the emperor of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and monarch of thoſe chriſtians, that are commonly known by the name of <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> who is falſly call'd by ſome writers <hi>Preſter John,</hi> wrote a letter in 1521, to Don <hi>Manuel,</hi> king of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and another in 1524 to his ſucceſſor <hi>John</hi> III. (which letters are to be ſeen in the <hi>Hiſpania illuſtrata,</hi> tranſlated by <hi>Paul Jovius,</hi> tom. 2. p. 1293, 1297,) in which he deſires thoſe princes to ſend him ſome of the moſt curious artificers of <hi>Europe;</hi> and in the latter he ſays thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I entreat you, my lord and brother, to ſend me ſome workmen to carve images, to caſt books, make ſwords and all ſorts of weapons; likewiſe maſons, carpenters, phyſicians, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, apothecaries, coiners of gold and ſilver, and perſons who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how to extract gold, ſilver, and copper out of the mines, to cover houſes with lead, to make ſhields and muskets; and in ſhort, all ſorts of neceſſary workmen.'</q> What ſucceſs theſe letters had, and whether king <hi>John</hi> anſwer'd his requeſt in any of theſe particulars, I cannot determine. But the ſecond tome of the <hi>Abyſſine</hi> hiſtory by <hi>Job Ludolph,</hi> or rather the commentator upon it, informs us, that when <hi>Abba Gregory Abyſſin</hi> ſaw the library of father <hi>Alphonſo Mendez</hi> a jeſuit, whom the pope had ſent into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> in quality of patriarch, in 1623, he could not forbear extolling that art, which had produc'd ſo many books, and <hi>eſteeming it as a ſacred invention, worthy to be plac'd among the regalia of the greateſt princes</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Exiſtimaſſe Typographiam, ſeu ſacrum quoddam inventum, inter Regalia principum haberi. Vide <hi>Chevil.</hi> p. 274.</note>. By this it ſeems, that printing had been wholly unknown to them at that time; and conſequently that it was never ſent thither by the king of <hi>Portugal</hi> or any other. However, our knowledge is very imperfect of thoſe remote parts of <hi>Africa;</hi> and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0712300300:296"/>
even of thoſe which are nearer, as <hi>Morocco, Fez,</hi> &amp;c. we can only ſay, that 'tis certain they receiv'd the art early from their neighbours, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and encourag'd it for a conſiderable time; yet whatever be the reaſon, ſcarce any footſteps of it now remain, if we believe Mr. <hi>S. Olon</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king's embaſſador to the king of <hi>Morocco;</hi> who, in his preſent ſtate of that empire, printed in 1694, aſſures us, that there is ſcarce one printing-houſe left in it. He adds, that it is a piece of religion among them not to ſuffer any corn, horſes or books to be exported; and that their fondneſs for books is the greater, by reaſon of their ſcarcity, ſince there is hardly a preſs in the whole empire.</p>
                  <p>WE read of ſome attempts made by the miſſionaries in <hi>Perſiae</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce printing there; which prov'd ineffectual. I ſhall ſay nothing here of the kingdoms of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> nor of their manner of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having already ſpoken of it upon another account in the firſt book of this hiſtory.</p>

                  <head>CHAP VIII. <hi>Of the Abuſes of the</hi> Art <hi>of</hi> Printing.</head>
                  <p>IT would have been very wonderful, if the encouragement, which that art receiv'd from the great and learned, ſhould not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd at the ſame time ſome perſons, whoſe ignorance and avarice would not permit them to aim at that degree of perfection; which they ſaw others arrive at, to engage in baſe methods of enjoying the fruit of their ingenuity and diligence, without the trouble of imitating them in it. We have already given occaſionally ſome accounts of theſe practices, in counterfeiting the works, names and marks of the beſt Printers, who have been oblig'd to remonſtrate againſt them to the world. For as ſoon as they had publiſh'd a curious and correct edition, with prodigious charge and labour, ſome of theſe pyrates immediately printed another after it, tho' in every reſpect inferior to the former; and either by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſelling, defrauded them of the reward of their care and expence, or by counterfeiting their names and marks, deſtroy'd their reputation.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0712300300:297"/>
By theſe abuſes, they were oblig'd to make many fruitleſs attempts in order to ſuppreſs theſe counterfeits, and at laſt to have recourſe to the higher powers for priviledges and patents, the only effectual way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch practices. We have likewiſe hinted, that ſome of theſe peſts of learning have impos'd upon the world, by ſelling their impreſſions as done at <hi>Venice</hi> or ſome other famous place, or pretending they were printed <hi>characteribus Venetianis,</hi> with <hi>Venetian</hi> characters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' they were the production of ſome obſcure place and printer, whoſe only aim was profit.</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER abuſe conſequent upon this, was the counterfeiting of dates. For when, by the care of a <hi>Froben,</hi> a <hi>Badius,</hi> or ſome other eminent Printer, the world was ſo far appriz'd of theſe counterfeits, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them could not vend their impreſſions, they immediately reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the title page, perhaps with ſome alteration, put a new date, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a new name to it, and ſo paſs'd them off for new editions. To recommend them the more to the buyers, they generally aſſerted them to be newly revis'd, diligently compared with the beſt MSS. corrected in above 500 places, and the like. It was with great difficulty that theſe abuſes were detected in ſuch a manner as to make the world aware of them. The complaints of the learned, and their vain efforts to remedy ſuch inconveniences are too well known to be mention'd here. I ſhall paſs to another equally ſhameful and dangerous abuſe, <hi>viz.</hi> printing of leud, infamous books, of which the learned <hi>Gerſon,</hi> among many others, complains with great zeal; and mentions particularly a romance, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the <hi>Romance of the Roſe,</hi> compos'd in 1300, of which he ſaid, that if he was the maſter of the laſt copy, he would rather chooſe to burn it than part with it at any price <note n="*" place="bottom">Si eſſet mihi Liber Romancii de Roſa, qui eſſet unicus, &amp; valeret mille pecuniarum libras, comburerem potius quam venderem.</note>. <hi>Paſtor fido,</hi> is a poem almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known, which, we are told by <hi>J. Nicius Erith,</hi> caus'd many virgins and marry'd women to proſtitute their honour. Yet great numbers of a much more pernicious nature have been publiſh'd in thoſe times. I ſhall only mention one, which I eſteem a maſter-piece in that kind, heighten'd by the art of engraving, that it might be a conſummate piece of the moſt ſcandalous lewdneſs in nature. <hi>George Vaſari,</hi> in the lives
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0712300300:298"/>
of the <hi>Italian</hi> painters, gives us this ſhort account of it; that <hi>Julius Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> the moſt celebrated painter of his age, invented above fourſcore deſigns, which he caus'd to be engraven on wood, while <hi>Peter Aretine,</hi> a great Libertine and Atheiſt, compos'd a ſonnet for each of the prints. This vile performance was publiſhed about the year 1525. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude with <hi>Vaſari</hi>'s character of it, <note n="*" place="bottom">Io non ſo qual fuſſe piu o brutto le ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacolo de i deſegni di Giulo ali' occhio, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As printing and the reformation begun about the ſame time, the former was proſtituted by the meaner ſort, who printed the vileſt forgeries on each, tho' that which was uppermoſt, acted moſt flagrantly, when the other was oblig'd to work covertly. But as this and the laſt do not ſo properly fall within my province as a Printer, I ſhall content myſelf with having juſt mention'd them, with abhorrence of ſuch practices, and return to ſome other abuſes.</p>
                  <p>THE next aroſe from want of good correctors; for perſons of that claſs were thought too chargeable by many Printers; who therefore made uſe of illiterate fellows, whom they could hire much cheaper; or, which often happen'd, us'd none at all. It will eaſily be imagin'd, what a number of wretched editions the world muſt have been peſter'd with by this ſordid neglect. However, as books were not yet ſo plentifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, as to ſuffice the number of ſtudents, there wanted not perſons either dull or poor enough to purchaſe them, eſpecially upon a ſmall abatement of the common price. This made ſome Printers deſignedly ſuppreſs the errata, which would have inevitably endanger'd the ſale of ſuch books; tho' others were oblig'd by the authors or editors to print them at the end of their works. The reader will no doubt be ſurpriz'd to hear of ſome of them ſo prodigiouſly large, as to be ſcarce credible. We have a remarkable inſtance in the works of <hi>John Francis Picus de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula,</hi> printed at <hi>Strasburgh</hi> for the firſt time in 1507, by <hi>John Krob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louch,</hi>

a man of ſome note, and at the charges of <hi>Matthias Schurrer,</hi> another eminent Printer of that place, who ſtyl'd himſelf maſter of arts. This edition was ſo faulty, that the author was oblig'd to make an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata of fifteen pages in filio, tho' the book was but a thin ſmall folio. Were I to treſpaſs the bounds of this period, I could mention ſome which amounted to fourſcore and eight pages, even in <hi>Venice</hi> itſelf, where <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who had been very unſucceſsful in the former impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his polemick works, ſent them in order to have them more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly printed; tho' quite the reverſe happen'd. <hi>Rome, Paris, Lyons,</hi> &amp;c. have been no leſs complain'd of upon this account. The learned <hi>Mich. Fernus,</hi> who with prodigious labour had collected, and revis'd the works of biſhop <hi>Campanus,</hi> was ſo provok'd to ſee them ſo incorrect, that he put an errata in the edition of <hi>Rome,</hi> with this ſurprizing title at the head <note n="*" place="bottom">Vix ex ſtulto demens, idemque ex de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">

The like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the Printers, he repeats in another edition at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1497, and wiſhes theſe incorrect and mutilated editions could be condemn'd to perpetual oblivion. <hi>Galatinus</hi>'s book <hi>De Arcanis Catholicae Veritatis,</hi> printed at <hi>Ortona,</hi> by <hi>Jerom Soncino</hi> in 1518, was ſo wretchedly maim'd by the Printer, that the author inveigh'd vehemently againſt all Printers in general, accuſing them, in his 12th book of <hi>adulterating and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the beſt copies, tho' ever ſo accurately written, in ſuch a manner, that it is impoſſible to mend them.</hi> But the Printers ſufficiently reveng'd themſelves on him, by reprinting, tho' long after his death, the <hi>Pugio Fidei,</hi> written by <hi>Raymund Martin,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> fryer in 1280 againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> in which edition they unjuſtly accuſe <hi>Galatinus</hi> of having taken the beſt part of his book out of this; tho' <hi>Galatinus</hi> does ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly own in his preface, that he had taken the greateſt part of his book
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0712300300:300"/>
out of it. <hi>Paul Middleburgh,</hi> a learned Dutchman of the univerſity of <hi>Louvain,</hi> and afterwards biſhop of <hi>Foſembrona</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> having wrote a Treatiſe about keeping Eaſter, which he call'd <hi>Paulina,</hi> gave it to a Printer of his own metropolis, nam'd <hi>Octaviano Petrucio,</hi> to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but he committed it to the care of an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> youth, wholly ignorant of the buſineſs, and who probably made his firſt tryal upon it; ſo that, in ſpite of all the accuracy of <hi>Poſthumius</hi> who corrected it, it was ſo maim'd and incorect, that the author was oblig'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain publickly againſt ſuch ignorant and careleſs Printers; who (ſays he) in the preface to the errata of that very book, invert the letters, change and tranſpoſe whole ſyllables from the end of one word to the beginning of another, and put one word in the text inſtead of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he might have added, that they have ſometimes omitted not only words and lines, but whole paragraphs and chapters, or elſe miſplac'd them extremely. We have in the laſt chapter given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Rob.

                     <hi>A complaint of the Art of Printing againſt ſome ignorant Printers, upon whoſe account it is fallen into contempt.</hi> At the end of this, are ſome <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> epitaphs, in honour of the moſt learned Printers till that time. In this complaint he tells us, that the corruption of ſo many editions was entirely owing to the groſs ignorance of the Printers, ſome of whom he knew, that could not tell the letters of their names <note n="†" place="bottom">Proh pudor! haud rarus numero repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur in illo, nominis ignorans prima ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta ſui.</note>.

be tir'd, if I ſhould mention the tenth part of the complaints which we meet with in the writings of the greateſt men of that time, againſt the avarice, ignorance and negligence of the Printers; ſome of which are ſo ſharp as to call them <hi>beaſts and drunkards, the offspring of wild centaurs and of</hi> Vulcan<hi>'s untam'd</hi> Cyclops; but I ſhall chooſe to give ſome more diverting inſtances of their own, and their corrector's ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and neglect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Chapius</hi> tells us of a change and tranſpoſition of words, which render'd the ſenſe wholly unintelligible, in his <hi>Sext. Decret.</hi> printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1510; where under the title <hi>De dolo et contumacia,</hi> he found theſe words; <hi>Et nuntio ella cum creditur ex de appiurato parati;</hi> inſtead of, <hi>Et nuncio jurato creditur ex De Apella cum parati. Henry Stephens,</hi> in his preface to his <hi>Querimonia</hi> juſt mentioned, tells us of an ignorant corrector whom he knew, who, wherever he met with the word <hi>procos,</hi> us'd to correct it <hi>porcos,</hi> and change the word <hi>exanimare,</hi> into <hi>exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare.</hi> He mentions others, who alter'd a word they underſtood not, for one more common and known; thus in the ſecond epiſtle of the firſt book, <hi>Horace</hi> ſays, <hi>Nunc adbibe puero pectore verba, puer;</hi> but the word <hi>adbibe</hi> not being underſtood by them, they ſubſtituted that of <hi>adbibe,</hi> which was more obvious to them; yet even this abſurd cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is ſtill retain'd in ſome more modern editions. To this, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we owe another correction in the ſame poet, where they have chang'd <hi>ſectis unguibus,</hi> into <hi>ſtrictis unguibus;</hi> whereas, <hi>Horace</hi> only meant the kind fair ones par'd their nails cloſe, when they encounter'd with the youths, leaſt the ſcratches which decency and formality ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them to give them when they play'd too rudely, ſhould enter deep enough to hurt them. <hi>Chevilier</hi> ſpeaks of a book printed by <hi>Guido Mercator</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in 1493, in which there is a flagrant error in the very frontiſpiece, for the title is <hi>Elegantiarum viginta praecepta.</hi> It may be objected, that this was an overſight; but the contrary is plain, ſince it is printed ſo in the next leaf, and at the end of the book, <hi>Expliciunt elegantiarum viginta praecepta Pariſiis per Guidonem,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that it evidently aroſe from their ignorance of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue. Nor is this to be wonder'd at, when <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tells us, in his preface to the 4th edition of his <hi>Adages</hi> in 1525, that ſome of the Printers of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0712300300:302"/>
                     <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> ſcarce knew how to read. This ſame author likewiſe wrote 10 or 11 years before this to his friend <hi>Schurrer,</hi> a Printer of <hi>Strasburgh. John de Savigny</hi> had been ſo ill us'd by theſe drunken and ignorant Printers, as he ſtyles them, in a work of the learned biſhop of <hi>Gaieta,</hi> which he publiſh'd in 1520, that he took the moſt effectual way to make them trumpeters of their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by couching his reproaches in ſuch terms in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as were not underſtood by either Printer or correctors. His words are theſe: <hi>In iſtos haud abſtemios</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>a Clitorio fonte longe remotiſſimos cudatur faba.</hi> Let the blame be laid upon thoſe drunken and illiterate Printers, who are equally remote from learning and politeneſs. We ſhall conclude this ſubject with one inſtance more. After the biſhop of <hi>Aleria</hi> had publiſh'd his edition of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s natural hiſtory, in the dedication of which he tells the pope, <hi>that he had ſpent nine whole years in correcting it, tho' he believ'd nine more would ſcarce ſuffice to make a perfect edition, Hermolaus Barbarus</hi> corrected almoſt five thouſand faults in it. Several other learned men engag'd in the ſame province, and in particular <hi>John Caeſareus</hi> corrected about four thouſand faults in his edition printed at <hi>Cologn,</hi> by <hi>Eucharius Cervicornus,</hi> a famous Printer of that city, in 1524, as he acquaints us in the preface. But the compoſer and corrector ſuffer'd a prodigious blunder to go uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the frontiſpiece of that book, wherein the reader is told, that this new edition is corrected in no leſs than four hundred thouſand places <note n="*" place="bottom">—opus hoc locis non pauciori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quam quadringentis millibus emacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius atque olim, nunc demum in lucem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire.</note>. 'Tis ſurpriſing, that a book ſhould be corrected in ſo many places ſince the laſt edition of it; but when the reader comes to the preface, he finds but four thouſand, and the Printer put <hi>quadringentis millibus,</hi> inſtead of <hi>quatuor millibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEN it was found, that neither the remonſtrances of the learned, nor their ſarcaſms continually printed againſt ſuch Printers, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon them to be more diligent, and procure better correctors; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral countries took methods of putting a ſtop to this growing evil. <hi>Spain</hi> was, I think, the firſt which ſhew'd the example, by a way to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0712300300:303"/>
make the compoſer and corrector more careful in their reſpective pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. It was order'd, that before a book could be ſold, it ſhould be examin'd by cenſors appointed for that purpoſe, and compar'd with the manuſcript; and that all the faults of the impreſſion ſhould be ſet down in the firſt leaſt; after which they were to write underneath, that the book, the faults of the impreſſion above noted excepted, was faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly printed. This certificate had generally the following title in <hi>Spaniſh. Eſta eſte libro bien impreſſo y correcto conforme a ſu original de mano. En Madrid,</hi> &amp;c. ſign'd N. N. It was ſometimes printed in <hi>Latin.</hi> Where they could not obtain ſuch an order, they follow'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> method as far as they could. Thus <hi>Jo. Raviſius Textor,</hi> profeſſor of rhetorick at <hi>Paris,</hi> made a kind of affidavit, that he had corrected all the errata of the dialogue of <hi>Henry Hutten,</hi> intitled <hi>Aula,</hi> printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1519, by <hi>Antony Auſſurd,</hi> who put under the title-page. <hi>Textor ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culavit.</hi> The ſame method was follow'd by <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> who in his edition of the <hi>Pimander</hi> of <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> printed in 1505, publiſh'd by <hi>James Fabry d'Eſtaples,</hi> has ſet down the names of the correctors in theſe words; <hi>Pariſiis ex officinâ Henrici Stephani, recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitoribus mendaſque ex officinâ eluentibus Jacobo ſolido Cracovienſi &amp; Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio Pratenſi, anno</hi> 1505. We could trace this method as far as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 15th century; which had this good effect, that thoſe books, in which the correctors had put their names, were always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to thoſe where no mention was made of any. There were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards better regulations obtain'd from the higher powers in every kingdom, in order to aboliſh theſe pernicious abuſes; but as they do not come within our epoch, we ſhall forbear mentioning them.</p>
                  <p>THE reader will excuſe me, if I ſo far digreſs from my ſubject, as to give an inſtance or two of the dangerous conſequences, which had like to have happen'd to two eminent writers of that age, to the one by the addition, and to the other by the ſubſtraction of a ſingle letter. The firſt is of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who in his paraphraſe on ch. 16, v. of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> where S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>Tu es Chriſtus Filius Dei vivi,</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Non ſuſpicione proferens, ſed certa &amp; indubitata ſcientia proſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tent, illum eſſe Meſſiam a prophetis promiſſum, ſingulari more Filium Dei,</hi> &amp;c. by which laſt words he only meant, as he afterwards explain'd it, that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0712300300:304"/>
Chriſt was the ſon of God after a particular manner, different from that which was common to men. But it happen'd, that in his <hi>Baſil</hi> edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion printed by <hi>Froben,</hi> the letter <hi>a</hi> being added to <hi>more,</hi> made it have a quite diſſerent ſenſe. Hereupon <hi>Noel Beda,</hi> a famous divine of <hi>Paris,</hi> and enemy to <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> fail'd not to take him to task for that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and charg'd him with having affirm'd, that Chriſt was only the ſon of God by adoption, and by a particular love of God towards him <hi>(fingulari amore)</hi> and not his eternal ſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Soon after which, the divines of <hi>Paris</hi> publiſh'd a cenſure of that propoſition to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing tenour; <hi>That it gave a falſe ſenſe to the words of the Evangeliſt, and a handle to men, to think wrong of the divinity of the Son of God, as</hi> Neſtorius <hi>had done; for that Chriſt was not the Son of God</hi> by any particular love of <hi>God towards him, nor by any adoption or favour, but that he was originally and neceſſarily ſo. Eraſmus</hi> clear'd himſelf by ſaying, that it was a fault of the impreſſion, and appeal'd to his original and former edition of the ſame paraphraſe, in which they would find the word <hi>more,</hi> inſtead of <hi>amore;</hi> but he was too much ſuſpected by thoſe gentlemen, to be eaſily believ'd either in this, or any other caſe.</p>
                  <p>THE other happen'd to the learned Dr. <hi>Flavigny,</hi> author of ſome letters againſt Mr. <hi>Jay</hi>'s polyglot, in which two learned <hi>Maronites</hi> had been employ'd by Mr. <hi>Jay,</hi> viz. <hi>Abraham Echellenſis,</hi> Regius profeſſor of <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> who had given the text and <hi>Latin</hi> verſion of thoſe two languages of the book of <hi>Ruth;</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Sionita,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the ſame languages. The former of theſe had committed a great many errors in his tranſlation, as well as in the text of that book, nevertheleſs he attack'd his brother <hi>Maronite,</hi> and charg'd him with ſome miſtakes in his part of the work. Hereupon Dr. <hi>Flavigny,</hi> who knew them both equally guilty, undertook to rebuke the aggreſſor; and in a letter to him <hi>(Echellenſis),</hi> made uſe of theſe words of our Saviour; <hi>Quid vides f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſtucam in oculo fratris tui?</hi> (why beholdeſt thou the mote in thy brother's eye?) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It happen'd unfortunately, that the firſt letter of the word <hi>oculo</hi> being either taken up by the balls, or dropt out of the ſorm, or ſome other way loſt, after the firſt proofs had been corrected, gave a very harſh ſound to it, and made it ſeem a profane jeſting upon that ſacred book. <hi>Echellenſis,</hi> in his anſwer,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0712300300:305"/>
took notice of this, and calls him a ſacrilegious and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> perverter of the holy text; and, without acquainting him with his faults, tells him, that ſuch an abominable correction of the text, was too foul for his pen, and only worthy the writings of a <hi>Flavigny;</hi> in ſhort, he ſpends near a whole page in the moſt opprobrious language againſt him, that the height of malice and reſentment could inſpire an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate antagoniſt with. Dr. <hi>Flavigny</hi> was a long time before he could diſcover the cauſe of this accuſation, and in all probability might have been ſtill longer ignorant of it, had not a friend of his ſhew'd it to him in the printed copy; for in the two firſt proofs the word was printed perfect. The reſult was, that the author being recover'd of his ſurprize, threw the fault upon the corrector, appeal'd to his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and to the two firſt proofs, proteſted his innocency and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſuch an action, and took a ſolemn oath, in order to clear himſelf. <hi>Chevilier,</hi> who relates this ſtory, tells us, that <hi>Flavigny,</hi> ſome time before his death, happen'd to mention this; and tho' it was above 30 years after this tranſaction, he could not forbear expreſſing the higheſt indignation againſt his Printer and corrector. Theſe inſtances ſufficiently demonſtrate the dangerous conſequences of neglect in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting to the author of any book, eſpecially in divinity.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this article of the incorrectneſs of the preſs, I cannot but mention ſome of the greateſt Printers; who, when any of their editions have happen'd to be incorrect, have made an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous confeſſion of, and apology for it, that the commonwealth of learning might not receive any diſadvantage by it, nor the authors ſuffer in their reputation thro' their neglect. I ſhall begin with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Schurrer,</hi> of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> allow'd by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> to be a perſon of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who printed in 1500 the treatiſe <hi>De Patientia</hi> of <hi>Bapt. Mantua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> But as he had committed the care of it to a negligent and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant corrector, he found himſelf oblig'd to add an errata of a page and half to it, which he prefaces in the humbleſt terms imaginable <note n="*" place="bottom">Maluimus potius pudore, noſtro fatendo plecti, quam tacendo reſpublica literarai ſuo damno noſtra peccata ſint.</note>; I rather chooſe, ſays he, to take the ſhame of them upon myſelf, by confeſſing my fault, than to let the republick of learning ſuffer by
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0712300300:306"/>
my concealment of it. Of this kind is the apology which the ſame Printer makes for the errors of impreſſion in an edition before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the works of <hi>Picus de Mirandula;</hi> wherein he deſires the reader, <note n="*" place="bottom">Errores chalcographis, non authori ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribito. Fatemur ingenuè culpam noſtram.</note> that he would not attribute thoſe errors to the author, but to the Printer, who frankly confeſſes his fault. Such errata's not only make ſome kind of reparations to the authors, but oblige likewiſe an honeſt Printer to be more careful for the future. <hi>Henry Stephens</hi> hath often taken the ſame method, and owns, that ſome errors have crept unawares into ſome of his editions <note n="†" place="bottom">Locis aliquot incuria noſtra aberrotum eſt.</note>. I ſhould digreſs too far, if I ſhould inſtance in all thoſe Printers, who have follow'd ſo good an example; 'tis ſufficient to ſay, that none of thoſe eminent ones, of whom we have given an account in this whole book, have ever been aſham'd of acknowledging the faults of their works, when they had any ſhare in them. I ſhall cloſe this with a pleaſant way, which the abovemention'd <hi>Stephens</hi> took to correct a fault in his edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>De praeſagiis in morbis acutis</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates, anno</hi> 1512. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every ſcholar, that the firſt ſyllable in the word <hi>Febris</hi> (a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or ague) may be either long or ſhort; but he having thro' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency ſpelt the word with oe, which made it abſolutely long, he corrects himſelf for it, by ſaying, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Febrem longam ſibi chalcographus dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git' tametſi febris correpta ſit minus pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſa.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Printer had fooliſhly choſen a long fever, when a ſhort one was much more eligible, as being leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT after all that hath been ſaid concerning the baſeneſs, negligence, and ignorance of ſome of the Printers of thoſe times, it muſt be own'd, that many a negligent and ignorant author, when he has been admoniſh'd of his errors, hath not ſcrupled to throw them upon the Printer and corrector; which I eſteem another abuſe of the Art of Printing. I could give many inſtances of it, were I not apprehenſive of betraying too great a fondneſs for our profeſſion. However, any judicious reader will eaſily perceive by the largeſt Errata's which we have mention'd, that the authors had as great a ſhare in them as the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0712300300:307"/>
Printers and correctors. <hi>Chevilier,</hi> who cannot be ſuſpected of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to the latter, has excus'd them in many caſes, and ſhewn that the fault was rather to be imputed to the former. But he has furniſh'd me with an inſtance of this, which, I believe, he little thought of; in the caſe of a learned divine of the univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe works having been cenſur'd by that body, and he refuſing to retract them, he was expell'd that univerſity, but was afterwards prevail'd upon to recant. After his death a paper was publiſh'd in his name, in which the blame was laid upon the proteſtant Printers, to whom he had intruſted the work. I ſhall relate the ſtory exactly after Chevilier, tho' ſomewhat abridg'd, and leave the reader to judge, whether the wrong perſons were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly blam'd. I hope the ſingularity of the fact will ſufficiently excuſe me, tho' it is of later date, than our prefix'd period.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>René Benoiſt,</hi> D. D. curate of S. <hi>Euſtace</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> made a <hi>French</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the bible, which he caus'd to be printed in fol. ann. 1566 by three eminent bookſellers of that city. This book immediately met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppoſers, who cenſur'd it as heretical and erroneous, alledging, that it was only the <hi>Geneva</hi> tranſlation; in which the author had ſoften'd thoſe expreſſions which were moſt ſhocking to the Roman Catholicks. The divines of that univerſity, having met ſeveral times, agreed to cenſure the book, which they did accordingly, <hi>July</hi> 15, 1567. The ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was renew'd, and ſubſcrib'd to, by ſeventy three doctors of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and approv'd <hi>viva voce</hi> by above one hundred and twenty more about 7 years after. <hi>Gregory</hi> XII. confirm'd the cenſure, and condemn'd the book, by a brief dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 1475. During this, <hi>Benoiſt</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to ſubmit, in ſpite of all the endeavours of that body to perſuade him to it. At length they agreed upon expelling him that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity as an obſtinate heretick, and the ſentence of his proſcription was written in great letters, and ſet up in the common diſputation-hall of the univerſity, by which he was, as it were, executed <hi>in eſſigie.</hi> However, <hi>Henry</hi> IV. took him into favour, made him his confeſſor, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted him to a biſhoprick; but the Pope refus'd to grant him his bull. At laſt, his ſeniority entitling him to be choſen dean of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, they all refus'd their votes, unleſs he would ſubmit to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cenſures, which he was at length oblig'd to do by a recantation,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0712300300:308"/>
in which he condemns his verſion, and rejects ſome parts of it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſly attributed to him. This was not done till the year 1598, <hi>i. e.</hi> 32 years after the publication of it.</p>
                  <p>IN 1608, a little before <hi>Benoiſt</hi>'s death, came out a book in 8vo, intitled, <hi>A declaration of</hi> René Benoiſt, <hi>concerning his tranſlation of the bible and annotations thereupon;</hi> in which he declares,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That the ground of all his ſorrow was the treachery of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, compoſer and preſs-man, who had been intruſted with the impreſſion of his bible; that the copy which he had given them was a printed one <hi>(here</hi> Chevilier <hi>notes, that it was a</hi> Geneva <hi>one,)</hi> upon which he had made his corrections and eraſements, which were not ſo fully eras'd, but that they might be eaſily read:<p>THAT ſome of the journeymen <hi>(they did not dare publickly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack their maſters, who would in all probability have clear'd themſelves)</hi> were of the <hi>Geneva</hi> leaven, and printed nothing in the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond proofs but what was in his copy; but when they came to the third, which he did not ſee, they ſubſtituted, inſtead of his corrections, the words or notes, which he had eras'd <hi>(ſome inſtances of which the author of the book gives),</hi> and which the compoſer and preſs-man in confederacy had maliciouſly falſify'd:</p>
                        <p>That it were tedious to enumerate all ſuch pieces of treachery; but that the reſult of it turn'd to his reputation, notwithſtanding his unſucceſsful attempts to bring thoſe journeymen to puniſhment:</p>
                        <p>That his books had been ſold under his name, tho' he had diſown'd them:</p>
                        <p>That the cenſure of the univerſity, and the confirmation of it by the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had condemn'd the work, and not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, was the conſequence of this impoſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>'</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I SHALL not enter into a detail of the reflections which <hi>Chevilier</hi> makes upon the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Printers, as he calls them, nor enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this declamation was really penn'd by <hi>Benoiſt,</hi> or father'd upon him; or if the former, whether it might not be extorted from him, a practice not unuſual with the divines of that church. I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, were the caſe as it is related in that pamphlet, 'tis ſcarce credible, that the doctor could have been 30 years unappris'd of it,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0712300300:309"/>
eſpecially when the cenſures and libels, continually publiſh'd againſt him, ſufficiently pointed it out to him; and if he knew it, can it be imagin'd that he would have continued ſo long under all that ſcandal, and the perſecution of his enemies, when he might have eaſily clear'd himſelf of the one, and ſo put a ſtop effectually to the other? Upon the whole, whoever the author of this declaration is, this ſtory evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently confutes itſelf, and is no other than one of their pious frauds, on which 'tis not my province to animadvert, any further than the credit of our profeſſion is concern'd.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I cloſe this chapter, it will be neceſſary to remind the reader, that this ſecond book being wholly confin'd to the hiſtory of printing in other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> (what relates to our nation being the ſubject of the next book,) I have given none but foreign inſtances of the corruptions and abuſes introduced into this art.</p>
                  <p>'TIS not therefore to be concluded, that it hath been free in any caſe from them in <hi>England;</hi> ſince we have imitated our neighbours in theſe bad, as well as in their other good, examples; and therefore as theſe abuſes have been equally common to us and them, I ſhall not repeat them in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> part, but only requeſt the reader, once for all, to remember, that we have had our ſhare as well in the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, under which our art has labour'd, as in the advantages and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, which it has receiv'd.</p>

                  <head>APPENDIX. <hi>An Account of a newly diſcover'd Edition, printed by</hi> John Guttenberg <hi>at</hi> Stratzburg <hi>in</hi> 1458, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me by, and now in the poſſeſſion of, the Right Honourable the Earl of</hi> Pembroke.</head>
                  <p>THE reader may be pleaſed to recollect that I have, throughout the firſt book of this hiſtory, conſtantly endeavour'd to fix the glory of the invention of Printing upon <hi>John Fauſt,</hi> and that of the improvements of it upon his worthy ſon-in-law <hi>Peter Scheoffer,</hi> excluſive of <hi>John Guttenberg,</hi> notwithſtanding the teſtimony of ſome few writers who have aſcribed the firſt diſcoveries to the latter. I did likewiſe offer it as a probable conjecture of the ingenious Mr. <hi>Maittair,</hi> that <hi>Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> having been caſt in a law-ſuit at <hi>Mentz</hi> for non-ſolvency of his quota, might retire to <hi>Stratzburgh,</hi> and there teach <hi>John Mentel,</hi> what he had been able to learn of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s art. We had not till then the leaſt ground to conjecture that he ever practiſed it himſelf, no annaliſt that ever I could meet with ever mentioning, or perhaps dreaming of, any edition printed with his name. But ſince then the noble lord above-mention'd, unwilling to reſt ſatisfy'd with conjectures, has ſpared no pains or coſt to inform himſelf whether there was any impreſſion extant done by <hi>Guttenberg,</hi> and has at length procured this curious one, which his lordſhip has been pleaſed to communicate to me. The reader, I doubt not, will be highly ſatisfy'd to find that, inſtead of contradicting any thing I have advanc'd upon that ſubject, it rather confirms it all beyond any poſſibility of doubting.</p>
                  <p>THE book is the dialogues of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> it has no title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, but begins abruptly with the ſubject itſelf, only at the end of it are theſe words;</p>

                  <p>I SHALL now beg leave to make a few remarks on this curious piece, and to ſhew how manifeſtly it confirms all my former conjectures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is very rude, and comes vaſtly ſhort of thoſe of <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Scheoffer;</hi> and the great and almoſt conſtant difference of the ſhapes of the ſame letters, ſhews it to have been done upon wooden blocks, after the manner of the <hi>paginae conglutinatae</hi> mention'd above, <hi>pag.</hi> 49 <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> there is, however, this difference and improvement in it, that it is not printed with the ſame (that is with the) common Ink, which made them incapable of a reiteration, <hi>i. e.</hi> of being printed but upon one ſide, but with the new invented ſort, which was a mixture of oil-var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and lamp-black, and will bear printing on both ſides. This, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhews that he had only got an inſight into the firſt diſcovery, but was an utter ſtranger to the laſt and more uſeful one of ſeparate metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types, which <hi>Fauſt</hi> had probably kept conceal'd from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. SUPPOSING it to be the firſt piece that ever he did, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was, if not the only one of that kind, it was printed in 1458, <hi>i. e.</hi> about three years after the law-ſuit and his falling out with <hi>Fauſt;</hi> ſo that it took him up all that time in cutting his blocks, and getting the reſt of the apparatus of a Printing-preſs, making of tryals, macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after he was ſettled at <hi>Stratzburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. IT is printed one year after the pſalter of <hi>Mentz,</hi> which was done in ſeparate metal-types, and wherein <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Scheoffer</hi> aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the whole glory of the invention; ſo that had <hi>Guttenberg</hi> had the leaſt pretenſion to it, he would not have fail'd doing himſelf juſtice by altering the ſtyle of his colophon, and telling the world what ſhare he had borne in this noble diſcovery, that his ſilence was not owing to his honeſty is plain from his refuſing to pay his dividend of the charges, much leſs to his being ignorant of the publication of <hi>Fauſt</hi>'s pſalter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Stratzburgh</hi> being both ſituate upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and not above 60 leagues aſunder, it was morally impoſſible he ſhould not have
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0712300300:312"/>
heard of it. On the contrary, it is likely that, having ſeen it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it to be printed with fuſile types, he might juſt finiſh this rude edition of his, and then ſtop his hand until <hi>Mentel</hi> and he had fallen upon the ſame way of caſting them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. THIS piece is printed upon the ſame paper that <hi>Fauſt</hi> did uſe, which is mark'd with the heifer's head and horns, and might either be his ſhare of the paper-ſtock which they divided at parting, and which he took away with him, or elſe might be deſignedly imitated by him, to give a credit to his work. Upon the whole, its having neither title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, running title, ſignature, nor direction-word, and being altogether a rude piece of workmanſhip, doth plainly ſhew it to have been of the nature of the firſt eſſays of <hi>Fauſt,</hi> and that it is by no means ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE only mention'd ſome of the moſt famous for their learning and diligence, beſides whom there were many more, who, tho' of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior claſs, in compariſon of the former; yet were all men of letters, and vaſtly ſuperior to thoſe, which Printers have been forced to make uſe of in proceſs of time. It muſt be alſo remember'd, that many of thoſe Printers of the 15th, and part of the 16th century, were men of great learning and parts, and indefatigable induſtry, able to prepare their manuſcripts for the preſs, and to correct their own works: Such were the great <hi>Amerback</hi> at <hi>Baſil,</hi> who was maſter of arts in the univerſity of <hi>Paris, Froben</hi> his worthy partner and ſucceſſor, <hi>Ant. Coburger</hi> at <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh, Aldus Manucius</hi> and <hi>Azulanus</hi> at <hi>Venice, Jodocus Badius</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and many more, of whom we have given an account in this hiſtory. And yet it is obſervable from this table, that thoſe, who were the moſt capable of correcting their own works, did ſtill entertain the greateſt number of correctors.</p>
                     <p>HOWEVER, I muſt not omit acquainting the readers, that thoſe great perſons whom we have mention'd in this liſt, were not properly correctors in the ſenſe we now underſtand that word; that is, men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0712300300:320"/>
by a proper ſalary to perform that function, but editors or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and correctors only of their own works; or if at any time they were prevail'd upon to overſee any curious edition, it was done rather out of curioſity than for gain. For 'tis certain that every Printer had beſides a corrector of an inferior rank to reviſe and correct every proof, if he did not do it himſelf, before they were ſent to thoſe great men, whoſe corrections were generally of a higher nature. What makes me mention this diſtinction, is the grief which the famous <hi>Eraſmus</hi> conceiv'd at his being upbraided by count <hi>Carpi,</hi> and more particularly by <hi>Jul. Staliger,</hi> with having ſerv'd as corrector in <hi>Aldus</hi>'s Printing-houſe, and the pains he took to clear himſelf from that imputation. Every body knows that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> had ventur'd to print a dialogue, entitled <hi>Ciceronia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in which he endeavour'd to ſhew that <hi>Cicero</hi> was more cry'd up than he deſerv'd; at which <hi>Scaliger</hi> was ſo enraged, that he wrote a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of that great maſter of eloquence in two different orations, which he ſoon after printed. In the laſt of which he addreſſes himſelf to <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in words to this effect; <hi>Did not you get a livelihood by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting</hi> Aldus<hi>'s proofs? and were not thoſe errata we meet with in them more owing to your drunken careleſſneſs than to the Printer? do they not ſmell ſtronger of your drunken cups than of the compoſer's dulneſs?</hi> He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards affirm'd that he met with <hi>Aldus</hi> one day at <hi>Mantua,</hi> who told him that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was wont to diſpatch as much buſineſs in one day as other correctors did in two, and to ſolace himſelf the reſt of the time with drinking of good <hi>Malmſy</hi> wine. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was ſo gall'd at this ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, as <hi>Merula</hi> tells us, he bought and burnt all the copies he could poſſibly get of it, and that he ſucceeded ſo well that there was not one to be met with. However, in his anſwer to count <hi>Carpi,</hi> he ſays that he was ſo far from correcting for <hi>Aldus,</hi> unleſs it were his own works, that he refuſed that office to ſome eminent cardinals who deſired him to reviſe the laft proofs of ſome works then printing: that if he took any thing elſe in hand, whilſt he ſtaid at <hi>Venice,</hi> it was not for lucre, but out of curioſity; and acquaints us, that <hi>Aldus</hi> had a conſtant corrector to his preſs named <hi>Seraphim,</hi> and then adds, <hi>Can he be call'd a ſervant who reviſes only his own works? for I never did any thing elſe for</hi> Aldus, <hi>whoſe Printing-houſe I uſed only for my conveniency.</hi> He has likewiſe been
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0712300300:321"/>
ſuppoſed to have corrected for <hi>Theodore Martin</hi> at <hi>Louvain,</hi> but it is likely that it was in the ſame manner, and on the ſame foot as he did it at <hi>Venice.</hi> I had not dwelt ſo long on this nice diſtinction, were it not that thoſe annaliſts, who have mention'd theſe great and learned men as correctors, have not ſufficiently taken notice of it. Beſides, it ought to be conſider'd that there is a vaſt difference between Printing and correcting the works of antient authors after a number of manuſcripts, which have been mutilated and ſpoil'd by every hand through which they paſs'd; and Printing the works of a modern author after his own manuſcript-copy, who is at hand either to reviſe it, or to be conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any difficulty. The former province requires perſons of the greateſt learning, abilities, and moſt indefatigable application, in reading and comparing their manuſcripts, in order to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the genuine meaning of an author and the blunders of his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers; whereas the latter may be ſupply'd by a perſon of moderate parts and induſtry. As therefore, they have been the greateſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of learning, I hope the reader will not blame me, if I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do them all poſſible juſtice, and to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe lazy and ignorant ones who have been, and are ſtill, juſtly reckon'd the common peſts of it.</p>

                  <hi>SOON after Mr.</hi> Palmer<hi>'s death, I was deſired to ſee what was ſtill wanting to compleat his</hi> Hiſtory of Printing, <hi>according to his firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and what materials he had left behind. I found, upon enquiry, that five ſheets of this last Number were already printed off; but that the third ſheet in courſe,</hi> viz. Q q, <hi>was left unfiniſh'd, being partly compos'd, and partly in manuſcript, most likely in expectation of that curious edition which</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0712300300:322"/>
                  <hi>the R. H. the Earl of</hi> Pembroke <hi>was then in ſearch after, which has been mention'd in the Appendix to this ſecond Book; and this ſeems to have been the cauſe of his delaying this laſt Number ſo long, that his laſt ſickneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his publiſhing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reader will, no doubt, be as much ſurpriſed as I was myſelf, at finding the last page of the ſecond book and the firſt of the third book ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently numbred; and that there is a retrogreſſion from 312 to 121: but, as the ſignatures of each ſheet do follow in their regular courſe, I am fully perſuaded that it muſt have been an overſight either of the compoſitor or of the author, which we hope the reader will eaſily forgive, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is not any thing wanting to compleat this ſecond book; and that the materials he left behind do even exceed his computation for filling this ſuſpended ſheet. However, as there were but three ſheets thus miſ-num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd, having been printed off long before the author's death, I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to ſet all the remaining ones in their due order, to avoid the confuſion that would otherwiſe unavoidably happen in the Index; and hope the reader will be kind enough to do the ſame with his pen to theſe three following ſheets. Thoſe, who know what a tedious ſickneſs Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>did labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der during the laſt two years of his life, will paſs by ſo inconſiderable an overſight, in conſideration of what he has done when he enjoy'd a better ſtate of health. As for the rest of this Hiſtory, we hope to find the materials in ſo good an order, that there will be little to do but to print after his manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, excepting where the noble Lord above-mention'd, or ſome of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed correſpondents, have communicated ſome new diſcoveries too curious to be paſſed by. And this furniſhes me with an opportunity of adding a new au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to what has been before advanc'd, concerning the firſt invention of Printing by</hi> John Fauſt <hi>at</hi> Mentz, <hi>omitted by Mr.</hi> Palmer, <hi>and ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me by an ingenious friend of his. It is a paragraph extracted out of</hi> Fox<hi>'s book of martyrs, printed in 1537, page 837, wherein that learned author gives an account of the first diſcovery of that art, in all the main particulars exactly agreeable to what has been advanc'd in the firſt part of this Hiſtory, and is to this purpoſe; That about the year 1440, or, as others affirm, 1446 and 1450, one</hi> John Fauſt <hi>of</hi> Stratzburg, <hi>and ſince a citizen of</hi> Mentz, <hi>found out the way of Printing by engraving upon metals, and by degrees improv'd it to cutting of ſingle words, and at length</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0712300300:323"/>
                  <hi>ſingle letters: that, after ſome eſſays, he communicated his diſcovery to</hi> John Guttenberg <hi>and</hi> Peter Scheoffer; <hi>and theſe three, being firſt ſworn to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable ſecrecy, made ſome conſiderable improvements in it: that</hi> Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg <hi>did at length, with</hi> John Mentel, <hi>publiſh the art at</hi> Stratzburg, <hi>which was ſoon after brought to greater perfection by ſome eminent Printers in other places; and in particular by</hi> Ulrick Han, <hi>or</hi> Gallus, <hi>at</hi> Rome, &amp;c. <hi>From this ſhort account it is plain that our</hi> Engliſh <hi>author had his intelligence from much better hands than many of the writers that have been quoted on that ſubject; and it is no ſmall pity that he, who has ſo exactly informed himſelf with what had been done at</hi> Mentz, <hi>had not given us alſo an account of the introduction and progreſs of the art here in</hi> England, <hi>we might then have found a much more ſatisfactory account of it, than the reader will find in the next book from all that Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>could poſſibly procure from other authors and records. However, as to this teſtimony, I doubt not but he would have been glad to have given it an honourable place in his first book, had he been appriſed of it; but it is not much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, that a book of martyrs ſhould be one of the last pieces of hiſtory wherein one would have look'd for it. What Dr.</hi> Fox <hi>ſays of their cutting or engraving upon metal, and not upon wood, as Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>and others have ſince more truly affirmed, can be only look'd upon as a pardonable miſtake in the former, who could not be expected to be a judge of things of this nature; whereas, what the latter advances may be ſurely rely'd on, not only becauſe it was in his own province, and that he neither wanted opportunities, nor ſpared any pains to inform himſelf aright in all thoſe curious particulars, but alſo becauſe his modeſty would not ſuffer him to rely upon his own judgment, till he had it confirm'd by other eminent maſters in the art of Printing, letter-cutting,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

1471; that at the <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the firſt preſſes were ſet up; that Dr <hi>Iſlip, Abbot</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> firſt introduc'd the art into <hi>England;</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> had it at leaſt 10 years before any other city of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> except <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Harlem.</hi> The falſity of ſeveral of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſufficiently appears from the firſt book of this hiſtory; and the others are manifeſtly diſprov'd ſince I have ſeen a book in the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s library, printed at the univerſity of <hi>Oxford, anno</hi> 1468. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, their miſtakes were unavoidable in thoſe times; becauſe they were ignorant of ſeveral material particulars, and of the firſt editions, which were abſolutely neceſſary to determine the true periods of the invention and introduction of the art into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT in 1664, <hi>Richard Atkins,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> publiſh'd an account of the foremention'd edition and an old manuſcript chronicle, preſerv'd at <hi>Lambeth</hi> in the archbiſhop's palace, in his <hi>Original and Growth of</hi> Printing, printed by order of the right honourable Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> ſecretary of ſtate. The deſign of this book, which is little more than an invective againſt the <hi>Company of Stationers,</hi> is to prove that printing is a branch of the <hi>royal Prerogative,</hi> and a <hi>flower</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Crown.</hi> This chronicle however, of which a friend of his, whom he does not name, ſent him a copy, is far from being of undoubted authority, ſince it is liable to theſe exceptions. 1. That neither <hi>Atkins</hi> nor his nameleſs friend pretend to have ſeen the original, much leſs to have compar'd the copy with it. 2. They give no account when and by whom this chronicle was written, and how it was bequeath'd to the <hi>Lambeth</hi> library. 3. No author, that I know of, beſides <hi>Atkins,</hi> mentions this chronicle in <hi>Lambeth</hi> library, except thoſe who quote it from him; tho' that author hop'd that his book would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the diſcovery and publication of it in time for publick ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, p. 4. 4. It is not to be found there now; for the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> aſſur'd me, that he employ'd a perſon for ſome time to ſearch for it, but in vain. 5. It gives an account of ſome particulars, altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the more authentic accounts, which we are now maſters of, with reſpect to the circumſtances of the firſt diſcovery of the art; ſo that we may ſuppoſe, that whoever the author was, he has taken ſome part of his account from common report, and from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have laid claim to this invention. I might add, that <hi>Atkins</hi> has ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſpers'd
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0712300300:326"/>
the chroniclers account with his own obſervations, that it is very difficult to diſtinguiſh them exactly. However, imperfect and precarious as it is, ſince it gives us the moſt probable and clear account of this important affair, I ſhall here ſet it down, as I find it in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor abovemention'd; after which I ſhall endeavour, by reconciling ſome inconſiſtencies in it, explaining ſeveral particulars, and adding ſome neceſſary remarks upon the whole, to lead the reader, if not to a certain, at leaſt to the moſt probable account of this matter.</p>
                  <p>The chronicle is as follows.</p>
                  <p>Thomas Bourcher <hi>archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>mov'd the then King</hi> [Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 6th.] <hi>to uſe all poſſible means for procuring a mold (for ſo'twas then call'd) to be brought into this kingdom; the king (a good man, and much given to works of this nature) readily hearken'd to the motion; and taking private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, how to effect this deſign, concluded it could not be brought about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſecrecy, and a conſiderable ſum of money given to ſuch perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as would draw off ſome of the workmen from</hi> Harlem <hi>in</hi> Holland, <hi>where</hi> John Guthenberg <hi>had newly invented it, and was himſelf perſonally at work. 'Twas reſolv'd that leſs than one thouſand marks would not produce the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd effect; towards which ſum, the archbiſhop preſented the king with three hundred marks. The money being now prepar'd, the management of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was committed to</hi> Mr. Robert Turnour, <hi>who then was of the robes to the king, and a perſon moſt in favour with him, of any of his condition. Mr.</hi> Turnour <hi>took to his aſſiſtance Mr.</hi> Caxton, <hi>a citizen of good abilities, who trading much into</hi> Holland, <hi>might be a creditable pretence, as well for his going, as ſtay in the</hi> Low Countries. <hi>Mr.</hi> Turnour <hi>was in diſguiſe (his beard and hair quite ſhaven off;) but Mr.</hi> Caxton <hi>appear'd known and publick. They having receiv'd the ſaid ſum of one thouſand marks, went firſt to</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>then to</hi> Leyden, <hi>not daring to enter</hi> Harlem <hi>itſelf; for the town was very jealous, having impriſon'd and apprehended divers perſons, who came from other parts for the ſame purpoſe. They ſtay'd till they had ſpent the whole one thouſand marks in gifts and expences; ſo as the king was fain to ſend five hundred marks more; Mr.</hi> Turnour <hi>having written to the king, that he had almoſt done his work; a bargain (as he ſaid) being ſtruck between him and two</hi> Hollanders, <hi>for bringing off one of the workmen, who ſhould ſufficiently diſcover and teach this new art: At laſt with much ado they got</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0712300300:327"/>
                     <hi>off one of the under workmen, whoſe name was</hi> Frederick Corſells <hi>(or rather</hi> Corſellis), <hi>who late one night ſtole from his fellows in diſguiſe into a veſſel, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd before for that purpoſe, and ſo the wind (favouring the deſign) brought him ſafe to</hi> London.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Twas not thought ſo prudent to ſet him on work at</hi> London, <hi>but by the archbiſhop's means, who had been vice-chancellor, and afterwards chancellor of the univerſity of</hi> Oxon, Corſellis <hi>was carry'd with a ſtrong guard to</hi> Oxon; <hi>which guard conſtantly watch'd to prevent</hi> Corſellis <hi>from any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſcape, till he had made good his promiſe, in teaching how to print: ſo that at</hi> Oxford, <hi>printing was firſt ſet up in</hi> England; <hi>which was before there was any printing-preſs or printer in</hi> France, Spain, Italy <hi>or</hi> Germany, <hi>except the city of</hi> Mentz, <hi>which claims ſeniority as to printing even of</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>itſelf, calling herſelf</hi> Urbem Moguntinam Artis Typographicae inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricem primam; <hi>tho' 'tis known to be otherwiſe, that city gaining that art by the brother of one of the workmen of</hi> Harlem, <hi>who had learn'd it at home of his brother, and after ſet up for himſelf at</hi> Mentz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This preſs at</hi> Oxon <hi>was at leaſt ten years before there was any printing in</hi> Europe, <hi>(except at</hi> Harlem <hi>and</hi> Mentz), <hi>where alſo it was but new born. This preſs at</hi> Oxford <hi>was afterwards found inconvenient to be the ſole printing place of</hi> England, <hi>as being too far from</hi> London, <hi>and the Sea: whereupon the king ſet up a preſs at St.</hi> Albans, <hi>and another in the Abby of</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>where they printed ſeveral books of divinity and Phyſick, for the King, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf and council, permitted then no law-books to be printed, nor did any Printer exerciſe that art, but only ſuch as were the king's ſworn ſervants; the king himſelf having the price and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument for printing books.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS far the chronicle, or our author's extract from it; for, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before, he diſtinguiſhes not his own from the chronicle, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us whether it be literally copied from the chronicle, or an abſtract of it; nor whether it mentions any other tranſactions beſides that of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing printing to <hi>England.</hi> I ſhall therefore follow him no further, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but examine the truth of the ſeveral particulars of this account: yet previous to this, I ſhall obſerve, that we have the like account of this affair in Antony Wood<hi>'s Hiſtory and Antiquities of the Univerſity of</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, printed in 1674, <hi>i. e.</hi> ten years after <hi>Atkins</hi> had publiſh'd his piece;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0712300300:328"/>
from which the foremention'd author ſeems to have taken his account wholly; in many particulars, of which he has been confuted by ſeveral writers, as ſhall be ſhewn immediately. To return to <hi>Atkins's</hi> book; which is unknown to foreigners, and ſeen but by few in <hi>England;</hi> the author of that chronicle is miſtaken in ſeveral points; 1. in ſuppoſing <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> or <hi>Harlein,</hi> as he calls it, to be the place from whence <hi>Corſellis</hi> came: It is not probable, that the art was invented there, eſpecially by <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> and in the year 1459, ſince it appears, the pſalter was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Mentz</hi> by <hi>Fauſt</hi> two years before that, beſides the ſeveral books printed on wooden blocks. Again, if the book mention'd by <hi>Atkins</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> to have been printed at <hi>Oxford, anno</hi> 1468, be the firſt book print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, 'tis plain, that city had not the art ten years before any other; becauſe I have lately ſeen a book printed at <hi>Strasburg</hi> by <hi>John Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> in 1458, as I have already hinted in the poſtcript of the foregoing number; beſides <hi>Strasburg,</hi> it was at <hi>Venice,</hi> the monaſtery of <hi>Sublaco, Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Rome</hi> and <hi>France</hi> before 1468. If it be urg'd, that there might be other books printed before that at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or that it requir'd ſome time to get all the neceſſary materials of a printing-houſe; the ſame pleas will equally ſerve for thoſe other places now mention'd. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> if we admit <hi>Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbergh</hi> to have carried the art to <hi>Holland,</hi> which we ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be extremely probable, it will be ſtill falſe, that <hi>Mentz</hi> receiv'd it from the brother of one of his workmen. Theſe are the inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and contradictions to plain facts, now certainly known, which dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the authority of this chronicle and of thoſe that follow it. We ſhall now endeavour to clear theſe inconſiſtencies, or at leaſt to ſhew how the author of it was led into theſe palpable errors, and from thence to diſcover the real truth of the whole tranſaction.</p>
                  <p>WE have already hinted at the probability, that he rather followed the reports ſpread about from <hi>Holland,</hi> than made a ſtrict enquiry into this ſubject. This will appear more plain from the following conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1. We hinted in our 1ſt book, that during the infancy of the art, <hi>Fauſt</hi> and <hi>Schoeffer,</hi> and together with them <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> carry'd on the buſineſs with all poſſible ſecrecy, till the former being oblig'd to diſcover it at <hi>Paris</hi> for his own ſafety, and the latter having broke the partnerſhip, and gone to ſet up the art elſewhere; it was thought of no
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0712300300:329"/>
further uſe to conceal this invention. 2. The reader may call to mind that we advanc'd a probable conjecture of Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi>'s, that <hi>Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh</hi> being caſt at law, and ſentenc'd to reimburſe his moiety, and pay the charges of the ſuit, went away to <hi>Strasburgh</hi> to evade the ſentence, which is now confirm'd by the book printed there juſt now mentioned; where not thinking himſelf fafe from further proſecution, he might really come down to <hi>Harlem,</hi> and there inſtruct <hi>Coſter,</hi> or ſome others in the art. This ſeems to be more than probable, not only from the chronicle's mentioning <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> and not <hi>Coſter,</hi> as inventor of the art, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from his dating the invention nine years later than it was diſcover'd; which muſt be aſcrib'd to its not having been known at <hi>Harlem</hi> till the year 1459, tho' it had been practis'd at <hi>Mentz</hi> from the year 1450, or ſoon after, as has been ſufficiently ſhewn before.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, if we conſider that <hi>Holland</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were the only places of <hi>Germany,</hi> into which we traded, whereas the city of <hi>Mentz,</hi> which lies very far in the continent, was then little known to us, we ſhall not wonder, that our firſt accounts of the original of printing, ſhould be taken from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> agreeable to their violent claims to the invention of it, and their ſcandalous ſtories invented to deprive <hi>Fauſt</hi> of his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; for the chronicle acquaints us, that the city receiv'd it from a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive ſervant of <hi>Guttenbergh,</hi> who had learn'd it from his brother then working with him, and went to ſet it up there. There remains one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle difficulty ſtill; why the chronicle attributes the invention to <hi>Gutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> when all their writers make no mention of him, but aſcribe it wholly to their countryman <hi>Coſter.</hi> To ſolve this, if we ſuppoſe this account given to the author by <hi>Frederick Corſellis,</hi> or even by Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> or <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> which is very probable; we may juſtly preſume, that they ſpoke as they were inform'd on the ſpot, agreeably to the account which <hi>Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbergh</hi> gave of himſelf and of his invention, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> dar'd not to contradict, till after his death or departure from <hi>Holland,</hi> when they aſſum'd the whole diſcovery to themſelves, and repreſented <hi>Coſter</hi> as the ſole inventor, excluſive of every other pretenſion. I have dwelt longer on theſe circumſtances, becauſe they notoriouſly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that thoſe contradictions to plain facts, univerſally known and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by all but the <hi>Dutch</hi> writers, confirm the authority of the reſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0712300300:330"/>
of the chronicle; ſince they are exactly drawn from the legends of that nation, which were then generally believ'd over all the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and were the only accounts that our merchants, and particularly the two gentlemen employ'd by the king, could procure concerning the original of printing. And 'tis not improbable that what the chronicle mentions of the impriſonment of ſeveral perſons at <hi>Harlem,</hi> on ſuſpicion of a deſign to ſteal the art, might be done rather out of fear leaſt any of thoſe ſtrangers ſhould rob them of their honour by expoſing the vantiy of their pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſince themſelves could not be ignorant of what was done at <hi>Mentz</hi> long before that time.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this chronicle,) which, as I obſerv'd, was unknown till Mr. <hi>Atkins</hi> publiſh'd it, I ſhall give an account, which I found in a manuſcript now in my poſſeſſion, which ſeems to be much older than the year 1664, when Mr. <hi>Atkins</hi> publiſh'd his account, and which, a few Circumſtances excepted, entirely agrees with that of the chronicle. The part relating to the introducing of printing into <hi>England</hi> being very ſhort, I believe will be acceptable to the reader, and is as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The riſe and progreſs of printing in</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The art of printing was firſt brought into</hi> England <hi>in the time of</hi> Hen. vi. <hi>at the charges of the archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury (Bourchier,) <hi>who employ'd one</hi> Turner <hi>maſter of the robes to the king, and one Mr.</hi> Caxton <hi>a mercer of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>but uſing the trade of a merchant, to go to</hi> Harlem <hi>to endeavour to bring over ſome of the workmen, that had then newly practis'd the art there, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon ſome of the under-workmen to come over with them into</hi> England, <hi>and to teach them their trade. As ſoon as they were landed, they were convey'd under a guard to the univerſity of</hi> Oxford <hi>for fear they ſhould run back again; and there they ſet up a preſs about the year</hi> 1467, <hi>as appears by ſeveral books that were printed there about that time. The names of thoſe workmen were</hi> Rood <hi>an</hi> Almayn <hi>(or</hi> German) <hi>and</hi> Winken de Worde; <hi>and the charges of the journey coſt the archbiſhop</hi> 1500 <hi>marks, as appears by ſeveral papers and memorials relating to this matter, that are ſtill extant in the library at</hi> Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. <hi>Shortly after there was a preſs ſet up at the Abbey of St.</hi> Albans, <hi>which continued till the diſſolution,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THE remainder being foreign to this chapter, ſhall be communicated in ſome of the following, to which it more properly belongs. I need not obſerve that this manuſcript aſcribes all the honour of this tranſaction to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0712300300:331"/>
the archbiſhoſhp; whereas the chronicle aſſures us that the king contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the greateſt ſum towards it. The date mention'd in my manuſcript is a year before the <hi>Oxford</hi> edition came out.</p>
                  <p>It may be here objected that the year 1467 cannot bring it within the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. who had been depos'd ſix years before; but I anſwer that the manuſcript does not aſſert that the <hi>Dutch</hi> printers came not into <hi>England</hi> till that year, but that their preſs was not ſet up till then; and tho' this happen'd in another reign, yet it will ſtill be true that king <hi>Henry</hi> caus'd them to be brought over, whilſt he was upon the throne, tho' the civil wars, and his being depos'd, put a ſtop to their proceedings for ſix or ſeven years. We ſhall have occaſion to remark further upon this in the next chapter. As for its complementing the archbiſhop with having been at the whole expence of the journey; it may be aſcrib'd to want of better information, or partiality to that prelate, who might ſtill be in great eſteem under king <hi>Edward;</hi> whilſt the good king <hi>Henry</hi> was ſtrip'd of the royal dignity and wholly neglected. With reſpect to the two printers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd there; the firſt is probably the ſame, <hi>Theodoric Rood,</hi> who printed afterwards by himſelf, and of whom we have but two editions printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> in 1480, and 1481, of which we ſhall give a further account in the next chapter. Whether he came along with <hi>Corſellis</hi> as an under-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is difficult to determine,</p>
                  <p>I am of opinion that <hi>Winken de Worde</hi> came not to <hi>England</hi> till ſome years after; tho' he might eaſily be confounded by the author of the M. S. with the other, on account of his <hi>Dutch</hi> name, and of his having ſignaliz'd himſelf afterwards by the number and elegance of his editions, which he printed both under <hi>Caxton</hi> and by himſelf. Thus 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ain that the few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which we have, agree in the following particulars; that archbiſhop <hi>Bourchier</hi> ſollicited king <hi>Henry</hi> VI. to procure the eſtabliſhment of the art of printing in this kingdom; that the king not only conſented, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed largely to it; that <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Caxton</hi> were employ'd in this deſign; that it coſt 1500 marks to execute it; that it was happily effected during the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. i. e. before the year 1461, ſince in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that year he was depos'd by <hi>Edward</hi> IV. and laſtly, that <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> was fix'd upon by the king and Archbiſhop to ſet up the firſt preſs in, and make the firſt eſſays of this art; which city therefore ſhall be the ſubject of our next chapter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Printing at</hi> Oxford <hi>by</hi> Frederic Corſellis.</head>
                  <p>SOME <hi>Engliſh</hi> authors, and particularly Mr. <hi>Howel,</hi> are of opinion, that the firſt trials of this art were made in the <hi>Ambry</hi> belonging to <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> afterwards carry'd on the buſineſs with good ſucceſs for a conſiderable time; as ſhall be related in its place. But as they affirm this upon the ſuppoſition, that the Abbot of that place, <hi>[Iſlip],</hi> was the perſon, who procur'd the art to be brought to <hi>England;</hi> whereas the chronicle abovemention'd, which they knew nothing of, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the contrary; in both theſe reſpects, I think it more reaſonable to follow it, than thoſe writers: nor indeed is it probable, that any but a crown'd head, or ſome perſons employ'd by him, would venture upon ſuch a dangerous project. Beſides, this account of the chronicle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the edition of 1468, mention'd in the preceding chapter, of which we ſhall ſpeak more fully hereafter: for tho' this comes ſhort in date of the laſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> VI, by ſeven or eight years, yet it is older by at leaſt as many, than any impreſſion of <hi>Caxton</hi>'s at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as far as has been yet diſcover'd. Add to this, that according to their Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> learn'd the art from the workman brought over from <hi>Holland,</hi> we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe the latter to have made ſeveral eſſays, and printed a volume or two at leaſt, before the former could be perfect enough in it to engage in that province. But I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Caxton</hi> either learn'd the art from him, or even came over to <hi>England</hi> with him; ſince 'tis much more probable, that he diſpatch'd Mr. <hi>Turnour</hi> with <hi>Corſellis</hi> thither, and carried on his commerce as well as his ſtudies beyond ſea. I am inclin'd to this opinion, by a paſſage in the preface to the ſecond book of his <hi>hiſtory of Troy,</hi> which he tells us he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the <hi>French</hi> at the deſire of the <hi>Dutcheſs of Burgundy,</hi> the King's ſiſter; which tranſlation, he ſays, he began at <hi>Bruges,</hi> anno 1468, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and finiſh'd at <hi>Cologn,</hi> anno <hi>a thouſand four honderd</hi> lxxi. Hence 'tis plain, that he was ſtill travelling in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0712300300:333"/>
three years after the firſt edition printed by <hi>Corſellis</hi> at <hi>Oxford:</hi> nor does it appear, that <hi>Caxton</hi> came preſently after to <hi>England,</hi> but ſtay'd to write a third book in the laſt mention'd place, <hi>Cologn,</hi> as he informs us in theſe words; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>The third book of the deſtruction of</hi> Troy<hi>—I have now good leyzer in</hi> Cologn<hi>—I have delibered in my ſelf beyng—to take thislaboure in hand</hi>"</q> 'Tis unreaſonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that a man of his years, (of which he complains in the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, ſaying, that <hi>age crept on him daily and feebled all the body,)</hi> ſhould come along with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Printer, and learn the art from him, and then go travelling again, having one book to tranſlate, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to write, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Fruits of Time.</hi> I am of opinion therefore, that he learn'd the art, at leaſt got a good inſight into it abroad, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at <hi>Cologn;</hi> tho' he might make himſelf maſter of the practical part of it after his return into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS far therefore 'tis plain, that <hi>Caxton</hi> had been on his travels ſome time, when <hi>Corſellis</hi> printed that firſt edition at <hi>Oxford;</hi> that the latter was the firſt Printer in <hi>England;</hi> and that <hi>Oxford</hi> was the place, where the firſt preſs was ſet up. The chronicle gives theſe reaſons why that Printer was ſent thither; 1. Becauſe it was an inland town, out of which it would be leſs poſſible for him to eſcape, than from <hi>London</hi> or any place near the ſea; 2. Archbiſhop <hi>Bourchier,</hi> who had been vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and was then chancellor of that univerſity, may be ſuppos'd to have had a more than ordinary regard for it, and, in conſequence of that, to have prevail'd upon the King to honour it with the firſt preſs. To theſe we may add the two following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That an univerſity was the moſt proper place for ſuch a work; becauſe it would ſtill be under the eye and direction of the learned men there, who could make choice of the beſt works to be printed, the beſt MSS. to print from, and the moſt skilful perſons to correct them; 2. the city of <hi>London,</hi> and almoſt the whole kingdom being diſturb'd and divided by the <hi>Earl of March</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the court engag'd in oppoſing his meaſures, an univerſity was a much ſafer and quieter place to lay the foundation of this art in, than any other in the kingdom. <hi>Corſellis</hi> therefore, and thoſe to whom he was to diſcover the ſecret, having ſworn fidelity to the king and his ſucceſſors, and being admitted into the number of the king's ſervants and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0712300300:334"/>
houſhold, began to exerciſe this art as ſoon as they had got all things ready for it. How long they were thus employ'd in their preparations, and what progreſs they made after I ſhall next enquire.</p>
                  <p>THE reader will have juſt cauſe to admire, that, if they began ſo ſoon as the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> VI's reign, <hi>viz.</hi> before <hi>anna</hi> 1461, they ſhould have publiſh'd no work yet diſcover'd till ſeven years after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1468; and that there are but three editions extant between that time and the year 1481, the edition of 1468 included; and, what is ſtill more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, that from that year to 1585, which is above 100 years, thee is not one volume to be found printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> tho' the art flouriſh'd in ſeveral other parts of <hi>England,</hi> as will appear in the progreſs of this hiſtory. This laſt particular I can by no means account for; but the other, I mean their ſlow progreſs at firſt, is eaſily ſolv'd by what has been hinted before, <hi>viz.</hi> the troubles which were then breaking forth, and fell upon the king and court, as well as his depoſition, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd immediately after their firſt ſettlement in that univerſity, together with the oppoſition made continually by his Queen and friends againſt his victorious rival. Beſides, if we conſider that the Printers were ſworn ſervants to the crown, and conſequently incapable to act without the king's ſpecial order, or at leaſt his licence, whilſt <hi>Henry</hi> their Patron was out of power, and the reigning monarch otherwiſe employ'd, it will be very eaſy to account for theſe delays, and the ſmall progreſs which they made in thoſe troubleſome times. We may likewiſe with great probability ſuppoſe, that moſt of their works were ſuch as were adapted to thoſe times of ſuperſtition, as prayer-books, manuals, legends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which periſh'd ſoon after the reformation.</p>
                  <p>IT muſt be own'd indeed, that the author of the chronicle, ſo often mention'd, tells us, that as ſoon as <hi>Corſellis</hi> had perform'd his promiſe, and inſtructed a ſufficient number of others in the art, it was thought proper to diſperſe them, ſome to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> others to <hi>St. Albans,</hi> &amp;c. Yet it is ſtill very ſurprizing, that ſo conſiderable a place as <hi>Oxford</hi> could not detain one of them by a ſufficient encouragement. However, 'tis plain, that except <hi>Theodoric Rood,</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> and native of <hi>Cologn,</hi> who very probably came over with Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> from thence, and of whom we have diſcover'd but two editions, there are no other footſteps of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0712300300:335"/>
printing in this univerſity extant from that time to 1585, nor any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable account among the writers of thoſe times for ſuch a wonderful ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. But this is not the only thing which the reader will be ſurpriz'd at, with relation to the ſlow progreſs which printing made at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have, in the former book, given an account of vaſt improvements made to that art in foreign countries, and to what a degree of perfection the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in particular, had brought it, not only with reſpect to the exquiſite beauty and variety of characters, richneſs and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of compoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but likewiſe by their introducing the learned and eaſtern languages, as <hi>Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,</hi> &amp;c. into their print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes, even before the year 1520, and printing ſeveral curious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglot works in all theſe tongues, beſides the <hi>Latin.</hi> But tho' I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtory thirty years further than theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> to the year 1550, yet the reader muſt not expect to find any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture done in <hi>England</hi> during that time. Our firſt Printers, tho' excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men in their way, contented themſelves with printing in their own tongue; and if they ventur'd ſometimes either upon <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> their productions in thoſe languages were few and inconſiderable: but with reſpect to <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> either thro' want of due encouragement from the learned, or of courage in them, 'tis certain they never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing of that kind till a long time after.</p>
                  <p>THE reader may remember with what difficulty the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were prevail'd upon to venture upon ſuch works; what objections and obſtacles they rais'd againſt ſo expenſive and hazardous an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: yet a learned <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſo far prevail'd with ſome of them, that he had the pleaſure of ſeeing ſeveral of his own works printed in thoſe languages; the reception of which ſoon encourag'd them to proceed in ſeveral noble undertakings. But the caſe was far different in <hi>England:</hi> for the learned Dr. <hi>Wakefield,</hi> having made an oration in 1584, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the ſtudy of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> tongues, and ſhew the uſefulneſs and neceſſity of them, was oblig'd to publiſh it maim'd and imperfect, wanting near a third part, becauſe, as he tells us, the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that time had no <hi>Hebrew</hi> types; tho' it was printed by <hi>Wynken de Worde,</hi> one of the moſt eminent Printers in <hi>Europe</hi> of that age. Printing in <hi>Greek</hi> made no great figure in <hi>England</hi> before the 16th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0712300300:336"/>
and the moſt learned work, which we have to boaſt of, was the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglot bible of Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> mention'd at the latter end of the laſt book, which was not printed till after the reſtoration by Mr. <hi>Thomas Roycroft,</hi> of whom I ſhall ſay more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>EXCEPT this, I don't find any footſteps of any works in the poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glot kind, but what were ſmall and inconſiderable. However, we, like the <hi>Dutch,</hi> have ſufficiently ſince atton'd for the ſlow progreſs which our anceſtors made in thoſe noble branches of printing.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now give an account of the editions before mention'd between the years 1468 and 1585.</p>

'Tis as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">'IT is agreed, that <hi>Corſellis</hi> was the firſt who printed in <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>Oxford</hi> and St. <hi>Albans</hi> were the two firſt places; the types, as may be ſeen in my Lord's books, at <hi>Oxford</hi> were like thoſe of <hi>Fauſt;</hi> the types of this at St. <hi>Albans</hi> are like the <hi>Dutch Spieghel. Junius</hi> argues for the firſt printing to be at <hi>Harlem</hi> from the <hi>Dutch Spieghel;</hi> but it appears from what is writ before the five books, call'd <hi>Paginae Conglutinatoe,</hi> that the <hi>Latin</hi> one of this <hi>Dutch</hi> was before it, the which he had not ſeen, neither does it conclude where it was printed; however, this book of St. <hi>Albans</hi> affords an argument, which <hi>Junius</hi> could not then know of, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> letter might be before 1460, and it favours what <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> ſays of a preſs brought over from <hi>Harlem</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. who dy'd in 1460. This is the ſame letter, and we read that <hi>Frederick Corſellis</hi> did at St. <hi>Albans</hi> inſtruct an old learned ſchool-maſter to print, and <hi>Corſellis</hi> was of a conſiderable age when <hi>Theodoric de Rood</hi> of <hi>Colen</hi> ſucceeded him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by whom we have two books printed; the firſt as old as 1480, already taken notice of. It has been a doubt, whether
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0712300300:339"/>
they firſt printed at St. <hi>Albans</hi> or at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the oldeſt book of St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> with a date is here; but we cannot prove this book of <hi>Miſcellanies</hi> to be older than the diſſolution of the Abbies by K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. 'till when a preſs remain'd, and the firſt letter us'd as late as 1490, ſuch a year appearing in this book. We know of but one more book at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> the which my Lord alſo has; it diſcovers that there was another preſs ſet up at St. <hi>Albans</hi> after this, with the letter of the <hi>Spieghel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is printed with <hi>Caxton</hi>'s types, and hath (as <hi>Caxton</hi>'s books have) the two improvements of indenting paragraphs, and dividing words by hyphens at the ends of the lines; the Printers of this, with the letter of the <hi>Spieghel,</hi> continu'd to print as they began, without the two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, even after the preſs of <hi>Caxton;</hi> tho' even here that preſs us'd his improvements. This other book is dated 1486 in words at length, at the end of the book of hunting, beſides the arms of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, which are at the end of the whole book. <hi>Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Aſpilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> quotes the whole book, as wrote by <hi>Juliana Barnes,</hi> and is ſo referr'd to by <hi>Bale</hi> in his <hi>Scriptores,</hi> tho' ſhe appears to be the author only of the piece of hunting; the treatiſe in that book of coat arms, is only a tranſlation of <hi>Upton de re Militari.</hi> That printed by <hi>Caxton</hi> at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in 1496, was a ſecond edition of this book.
<p>OF this, with the types of the <hi>Spieghel,</hi> there is a ſecond edition in 1529, printed by <hi>Winken de Worde;</hi> it conſiſts of miſcellanies, and has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very remarkable, as the old tryal in K. <hi>Henry</hi> VI's time at <hi>Leiceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> (not taken notice of in our great collection of ſtate-tryals) of the cardinal of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> impeach'd by the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> before the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> in which appears the names of the mitred Abbots among the Lords ſpiritual and temporal, and the form of the clerks entring as they came in, and at different times took the oaths. The names of the thirty ſix churches in <hi>London</hi> and ſuburbs that were not parochial; alſo of the hundred and eighteen pariſh churches and their patrons. In this is the <hi>Nut brown maid,</hi> ſuppos'd by <hi>Chaucer,</hi> as <hi>Skelton</hi> confirms, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had a copy given him by <hi>Lidgate,</hi> Monk of <hi>Bury.</hi> Mr. <hi>Prior</hi> has made a paraphraſe on it, and has alſo printed it from the old <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but knew not that it was by <hi>Chaucer;</hi> beſides, in his, each verſe is divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two, as the firſt verſe ends with <hi>among,</hi> and the ſecond ends

                  <p>THUS far we have copied from my Lord's manuſcript notes before his books of St. <hi>Albans.</hi> We now proceed to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and here 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to obſerve, that Dr. <hi>Iſlip,</hi> abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> having very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally promoted this art, and encourag'd Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> to whom he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd that part of the Abby, ſuppos'd by ſome of our hiſtorians to be the Ambry or Eleemoſinary.

This notion of his introducing the art into our nation, which has prevail'd among ſeveral of our writers, is not only contradicted by the author of the chronicle, but ſeems to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on this account, that if there had been any truth, in it, Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> would have been oblig'd in gratitude to have taken notice of this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar piece of merit of his friend and patron, in ſome of the prefaces to his works.</p>

                     <p>MR. <hi>Caxton</hi> was born, as he writes himſelf, in the <hi>Weeld</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> where the broadeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> is ſpoken; but as <hi>Fuller,</hi> in his <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Worthies</hi> aſſerts, he was born at <hi>Caxton</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps lead into that error by his ſirname, ſince it was the cuſtom of that time for perſons to denominate themſelves from the place of their birth. I think it will be neceſſary to ſubjoin his own account of himſelf in this reſpect, from his preface to the <hi>Recule of the Hiſtoryes of Troye,</hi> tranſlated by him out of the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Raoul le Fevre, Prieſt.—</hi>

His education was owing to his mother, and extended no farther than to read and write, which, he ſays, procur'd him a good maintenance.

But, as he does not mention it as a part of his youthful education, 'tis very probable that he did not apply himſelf to the ſtudy of it till a long time after.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> beſides his accompliſhments as a merchant, acquired a great deal of politeneſs, partly by his travels for 30 years, and partly by his frequent reſidence at the court of the dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſiſter to king <hi>Edward</hi> IV, who careſs'd and patroniz'd him very much; for, in the preface abovemention'd, he tells us, that he was <hi>a ſervant to her grace, and received of her a yearly fee, and other many good and greate benefits.</hi> He was likewiſe a favourite to ſeveral of our kings, particularly <hi>Henry</hi> VI, <hi>Edward</hi> IV, <hi>Richard</hi> III, and <hi>Henry</hi> VII; and highly eſteem'd by the prime of our nobility, and eſpecially by the duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the king's uncle, to whom he dedicated ſome of his works; the counteſs of <hi>Derby,</hi> king <hi>Henry</hi> VII's mother; the earl of <hi>Rivers, Arundel,</hi> with many others. As he was a perſon indefatigable and ambitious of applauſe, as well as earneſt in promoting the glory of his own country, he read inceſſantly the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0712300300:345"/>
hiſtories of his own and other nations; which at proper times he digeſted into order. At his return to <hi>England,</hi> he became acquainted with a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſchoolmaſter of <hi>St. Albans,</hi> ſuppos'd by ſome writers upon good grounds to have been the printer of <hi>Juliana Barnes.</hi> This perſon, having laid the foundation of a compleat body of <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtory, kept a conſtant corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> and was aſſiſted by him in his tranſlations; but, being prevented by death from finiſhing his work, Mr. <hi>Caxtom</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd his papers, examin'd, and reduc'd them to order, and compar'd them with the beſt authors he could get, as <hi>Livy, St. Auſtin, Gildas, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Iſidorus, Caſſiodorus, Geoffrey of Monmouth, William of Malmeſbury, Martin Canſulanus,</hi> and others; from whom he alſo extracted many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſſages, which he added to the hiſtory. This work he entitled <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus temporum,</hi> or the fruits of time, in ſeven books; to which he ſubjoin'd a chronology. The hiſtory begins with the giants, the firſt ſuppos'd inhabitants of this iſland, and concludes with the 23d year of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. viz. <hi>ann.</hi> 1483. What ſhare our author had in this performance, and how great a part was done by the ſchoolmaſter, is impoſſible to determine. This book was often reprinted and much valued at that time; yet, tho' it is the moſt conſiderable piece which Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> publiſh'd, we have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others written and printed by himſelf, which are as follow:

                     <p>BESIDES theſe, there are ſeveral others in the liſt of his printed works ſubjoin'd to the account of his life. He printed likewiſe ſome books in <hi>French,</hi> as <hi>La legende doree,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome in <hi>Latin,</hi> as <hi>Vita patruum</hi> and <hi>Boetius de conſolatione philoſophiae,</hi> &amp;c. This catalogue of his works, as an author, I have taken from <hi>Pitts</hi> and <hi>Bale;</hi> the latter of whom gives him the character of <hi>vir non omnino ſtupidus nec ignavia tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,</hi> neither a perfect dunce nor abandon'd to lazineſs: I ſhall more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſent to the judgment of a much later and more judicious writer, Dr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> who ſays of <hi>Bale</hi> (p. 177) that he gives the account of men and their labours at random; and of <hi>Caxton</hi> (p. 190) that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities he had, of being acquainted with the court-tranſactions of his own time, would encourage his reader to hope for greater matters from him; but that his fancy ſeems to have lead him into an undertaking (with reſpect to his <hi>Fructus temporum)</hi> above his ſtrength. There is one thing very obſervable concerning this excellent Printer and author, that he tranſlated, printed, corrected, illuminated and bound all his Books with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own office or printing-houſe. As he printed long before the method of adding the errata at the end of books was in uſe, ſo his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary exactneſs oblig'd him to a great deal more trouble than can eaſily be imagin'd; for he tells us, in the preface to ſome of his books, that his chief care, after a work was printed off, was to reviſe it, and mend all the faults with his own hand with red ink; which being done to one copy, he caus'd ſome of his journey-men to do the ſame throughout the whole impreſſion; which he afterwards compar'd with his firſt ſheet, to ſee that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0712300300:347"/>
they had not omitted any of his corrections. 'Tis true, they did not print off ſo large a number of books as now; for 250 or 300 were thought a large impreſſion; but even that number made it very tedious to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect throughout: tho' this was practis'd by ſeveral eminent Printers of other nations, 'till they found out the way of printing the errata in ſome blank leaves of the book.</p>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Caxton</hi> having made himſelf a perfect maſter of the Art of Printing (not at <hi>Oxford</hi> under <hi>Fred. Corſellis,</hi> as ſome authors imagine, but during his travels beyond ſea, as will appear hereafter) came and ſettled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where abbot <hi>Iſlip</hi> (as ſome ſay) his friend and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, aſſign'd him one of the chapels belonging to the abby, as we have before quoted from <hi>Newcourt,</hi> as being retir'd and free from interruption; and from this or ſome other chapel, 'tis ſuppos'd that the name of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel has been given to all printing-houſes in <hi>England</hi> ever ſince. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is by ſome reported, that it was ſet up in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there, I can trace no footſteps of its having been practis'd in that place. My manuſcript beforemention'd ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'that a preſs was ſet up in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> abby by abbot <hi>Iſlip,</hi> in the little ambry, where <hi>William Cax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was maſter.'</q> Mr. <hi>Bagford</hi> aſſigns the houſe in the ambry which was formerly the king's head, as the place where <hi>Caxton</hi> carried on his printing, but had I been early enough in my enquiry before 'twas pull'd down, as Mr. <hi>Bagford</hi> was, I flatter my ſelf I could have found ſome remains. I have great reaſon to think it had been a printing-houſe, by having been inform'd, that ſome perſons found among the rubbiſh ſome remains of printing materials; but, thro' ignorance of the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of them, they are either loſt or deſtroy'd. As I have given my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the arts being practis'd in the chapel at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> I rather think, that our technical terms in printing, ſuch as a printing-houſe being call'd a chapel; and where printing is grey in one place, and too black in another, the grey is call'd a fryar, and the black a monk; I think, I ſay, that theſe terms took their original from the art's being practis'd in other religious houſes beſides that at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> for 'tis evident, by the book hereafter mention'd, printed in the exempt monaſtery of <hi>Tavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> by <hi>Dan Thomas Richard,</hi> monk of the ſaid monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ſeveral of the religious orders exercis'd this art, perhaps in ſome
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0712300300:348"/>
outer chapel, which, being dedicated to ſome ſaint, was only us'd once a year on the anniverſary of that ſaint.</p>
                     <p>THE reader will find, that printing-houſes were ſet up in ſeveral cities and towns in <hi>England,</hi> where they had any conſiderable religious houſe. Thus we ſee the abby of St. <hi>Albans</hi> had printing there very ſoon, as before notic'd. Nor was this the only religious houſe where printing was practis'd, and that very early; for time has diſcover'd to us ſeveral others, ſuch as <hi>Taviſtock,</hi> as aforeſaid, <hi>Worceſter, Canterbury, Ipſwich;</hi> which were choſen for that purpoſe. We have already hinted, that the firſt Printers were ſworn ſervants to the Crown; and in particular Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> not only printed as ſuch, but all his impreſſions were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended either by the king, or princes of the blood, or by ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent patron amongſt the nobility, who bore the charges of the whole. The types with which he printed were peculiar to himſelf, and eaſily diſtinguiſh'd from any other, being a mixture of ſecretary and Gothic in ſhape, the ſize great primer. He had ſeveral eminent workmen under him; particularly <hi>Winken de Worde,</hi> a Dutchman, and <hi>Rich. Pynſon,</hi> a citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who afterwards printed for themſelves many valuable pieces, which ſhall be mention'd in their proper place. They likewiſe us'd a letter peculiar to themſelves, which as I ſhall take notice, differ'd from their maſter's, and was more refin'd and moderniz'd. Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his other valuable qualifications, was a perſon of exemplary piety and ſtrictneſs of life. He continu'd printing from before the year 1474 to 1495, as is evident from the end of the <hi>Vita patrum</hi> and <hi>Hilton</hi>'s <hi>ſcale,</hi> printed, or rather finiſh'd, in that year by <hi>Winken de Worde.</hi> Mr. auditor <hi>Jett</hi> deceas'd, aſſur'd me, that he was bury'd in St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s church, <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and that he ſaw the remains of his tomb-ſtone, but I have not as yet been able to find it.</p>
                     <p>THE liſt of his works is as follows; in which I could not poſſibly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the right titles of each book; but ſuch as I could meet with, I have ſet down exactly as printed by him. Thoſe which have no certain date are put at the end.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>THIS edition, though I have given it no higher rank, upon the account of its having no date, doth yet manifeſtly appear to me to have been the firſt book extant of <hi>Caxton</hi>'s Printing. I have ſeen it at my Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s library, and compar'd it with thoſe of the <hi>Game of Cheſs,</hi> his three books of the hiſtory of <hi>Troy,</hi> and his <hi>Polychronicon;</hi> all which have been ſeverally look'd upon as his oldeſt edition by one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſt or other, and find in it theſe two unqueſtionable marks of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity above the other three, <hi>viz</hi> 1. The types on which it is printed appear to be entirely new, though they be the very ſame which he uſed in all his other works; whereas, in the others they ſeem to be more uſed and worn. 2. This edition is the only one whoſe lines are not ſpaced out to the end; this being an improvement and elegancy introduced by him in imitation of foreign Printers; whereas all the firſt editions had the ſame defect with this.</p>
                     <p>As for the three books of the hiſtory of <hi>Troy,</hi> the ſecond is that which I imagine to have been printed firſt. I have ſeen it very perfect in ſeveral libraries, but the firſt and third I never could meet with any where, but in the noble library above mention'd. And even here they are ſomewhat imperfect, the firſt book wanting a few leaves at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the third at the end. However, they all bear alike the mark of antiquity, and are unqueſtionably done with <hi>Caxton</hi>'s types. The oldeſt book I could ever meet with that bears a date is his ſecond edition of the <hi>Game at Cheſs,</hi> in 1474, as may be ſeen by the catalogue above; and what inclines me to believe it to have been the firſt of that kind, is that the ſame date 74 is continued in his following works that are dated, to which he ſometimes added the two initial letters of his name, as in the mark or rebus here ſubjoined.</p>

                     <p>WINKEN <hi>de Worde,</hi> the <hi>Dutchman,</hi> is ſuppos'd to have come over with Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> and was his ſervant and journey-man. He ſucceeded him in his Printing-houſe, as appears from ſome of his firſt impreſſions done by him, as he tells us, <hi>in the houſe of Mr. Caxton.</hi> It's difficult to aſſign the exact time when he came to <hi>England;</hi> whether with <hi>Frederick Corſellis,</hi> as my manuſcript affirms, or ſome years after, which is more probable. After Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi>'s death, he carry'd on the buſineſs, and finiſh'd ſome volumes begun by his maſter, as the <hi>Canterbury-tales</hi> and <hi>Hilton's ſcale of perfection.</hi> This laſt Mr. <hi>Mattaire</hi> dates in the year 1494, and Mr. <hi>Bagford</hi> 1465, who gives it as the firſt impreſſion done in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken de Worde</hi>'s name. I have choſen to follow Mr. <hi>Bagford,</hi> who was very exact, as far as he could procure materials; for I have not yet met with the book my ſelf. Though the liſt of this Printer's works is very large, yet I am certain there are many more either loſt or ſtill latent in ſome libraries; for he was a perſon of vaſt induſtry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd all imaginable encouragement; ſo that he publiſh'd ſeveral vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes in one year, though we meet with ſome conſiderable chaſms in others, during which time we cannot ſuppoſe him idle. He left <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and ſet up his Printing-houſe in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> at the ſign of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>St Bride.</hi> I cannot determine the year of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval; though his firſt impreſſion there was done, <hi>anno</hi> 1503. He printed ſeveral <hi>Latin,</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh</hi> volumes, but no <hi>Greek,</hi> as I can find. He continued Printing with great applauſe till the year 1533,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0712300300:356"/>
if not beyond that time. At his death he left a ſum of money for an annual <hi>obiit</hi> for his ſoul to the pariſh of <hi>St. Bride's,</hi> of which he was an inhabitant. He was a perſon of great accompliſhments in learning, as well as ſtrictneſs of morals; and though he was the immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Caxton,</hi> yet he improv'd the art to a very great perfection. At his firſt ſetting up for himſelf, his firſt care was to cut a new ſett of puncheons, which he ſunk into matrices, and caſt ſeveral ſorts of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-letter, which he afterwards us'd. As <hi>Caxton</hi> us'd but two ſizes, <hi>Double Pica</hi> and <hi>Great Primmer,</hi> viz.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Winken de Worde</hi> gave a greater ſcope to his fancy, and form'd ſuch a variety of ſorts and ſizes of letter, that for ſeveral years after him, none of his ſucceſſors attempted to imitate him therein. If he was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual operator in cutting and caſting in his own founding-houſe, 'tis an incredible improvement which he made to the art; but, if he had his letter from any other Printer abroad, though it robs him of this glory, yet his excellent method of diſpoſition, compoſition, and preſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, ſhews him to have far excell'd his maſter, and even to rival any of of his contemporaries abroad. There is one circumſtance that induces me to think that he was his own letter-founder; which is, that in ſome of his firſt Printed books, the very letter he made uſe of, is the ſame us'd by all the Printers in <hi>London</hi> to this day; and I believe were ſtruck from his puncheons.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the two lin'd <hi>Great Primmer</hi> black,</p>

He is the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Printer, who introduc'd the <hi>Roman</hi> letter in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he us'd with his <hi>Gothic</hi> or black letter, to diſtinguiſh any thing remarkable, as we do the <hi>Italic</hi> with the <hi>Roman</hi> at this time. His letter is different from moſt other Printers, and is caſt ſo true, and ſtands ſo well in line, as not to be excell'd by any ever ſince: in his <hi>Gothic</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> letter he fell in with the cuſtom of thoſe times by uſing abbreviations, even in his ſmall ſiz'd letters. One circumſtance I would obſerve is, that he is the only Printer I can find in <hi>England</hi> that us'd very ſmall body'd letters in the infancy of the art, and he was fond even to the very laſt of uſing his maſter <hi>Caxton</hi>'s rebus, of which we have given a ſpecimen at the bottom of page 340. Upon the whole, he was a very curious, laborious, and indefatigable Printer; and I doubt not but time will add to his character, by bringing to light ſome noble teſtimonies of ſo great a man, which for want of, I am obliged to ſay ſo little here. He is the firſt Printer I have yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd who began to print the year-books. <note n="1" place="bottom">He and his Succeſſor <hi>Richard Pinſon Lincoln's-Inn</hi> Manuſcript-library, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed above 40 year-books, which are in ſcrib'd <hi>Libri manuſcripti.</hi>

                     <p>WE ſhall have occaſion to give a further account of theſe year-books, when we come to ſpeak of <hi>R. Pinſon,</hi> who continued printing them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time after <hi>Winken de Worde</hi>'s death. As for the eleven gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars they are in one volume in the form of a very ſmall quarto and neatly printed, and it is judiciouſly obſerved that they were printed above a century before that famous one of <hi>Lylly,</hi> which has been thought (and is ſtill, by thoſe who never heard of this edition,) to be the firſt grammar that ever was printed in <hi>England.</hi>

FROM this large catalogue of <hi>Winken de Worde</hi>'s works, it is plain that he muſt have been an indefatigable Printer; and that the chaſms that frequently happen in ſome years muſt be owing to the books being either loſt, or as yet undiſcover'd; but more probably the former: and whoever conſiders that the greateſt part of them were either ſchool-books, claſſics, prayer-books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (beſides a vaſt number of popiſh ones, which might daily periſh ſoon after the Reformation) and of how ſhort duration the former are in the hands of ſchool-boys and devotees ſuch as that age abounded with, will rather wonder that ſo great a number of them have eſcaped the common fate of ſuch performances. So that we may juſtly conclude, that the preſervation of theſe books is more owing to the character and excellency of the Printer than of the authors, and to the neatneſs and correctneſs of the work, rather than the goodneſs or uſefulneſs of the ſubject. After he was removed from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> we do not hear of any other Printers at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; if there were any, they were ſuch whoſe works and memory in all probability died with, or ſoon after them.</p>

However, be that how it will, it is certain that if it was but ſlow in receiving it, it made ample amends for it afterwards, and that <hi>Pinſon</hi> and <hi>De Worde,</hi> when he removed thither, gave a new life to it; ſo that in a little time there were ſeveral conſiderable Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes ſet up in the moſt convenient parts of this large metropolis,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0712300300:366"/>
wherein it has flouriſhed and improved ever ſince. Some of thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Printers received likewiſe great encouragement from the Crown, particularly by patents for printing of Bibles, and other works, of which I ſhall give an account under the names of the Printers to whom they were granted.</p>

                        <hi>N. B.</hi> As <hi>Caxton</hi> printed all his works in the old letter, and <hi>W. de Worde</hi> in a mix'd character of Roman and Black, we have diſtinguiſh'd their works in the two former catalogues, from thoſe that follow, by printing them in Italic: but, as the Roman types became by this time more common, we ſhall give the liſt of the following Printers works in that character.</p>
                     <p>THIS antient and curious edition above mention'd is as follows; <hi>Valdeſius ſuper Pſalterium Londini.</hi> 1481.</p>

                        <head>I. RICHARD PINSON. Anno MCCCCXCIII.</head>
                        <p>RICHARD PINSON, <hi>alias</hi> PYNSON, is the firſt known Printer in the city of <hi>London,</hi> no edition having been hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, except that anonymous one mention'd above, of older date than his dialogue of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Pauper</hi> in 1493. Beſides, as we have about 15 editions of his that are without date, we may more reaſonably ſuppoſe that they were printed before than after this year, in which he began to put a date. He was brought up under Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> as well as <hi>Winken de Worde,</hi> and being become a thorough maſter of the art, went and ſet up a Preſs of his own at <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> as the inſcription of his firſt edition ſhews. The friendſhip which he had contracted with <hi>De Worde,</hi> whilſt theſe two wrought under <hi>Caxton,</hi> was ſo far from being diſturb'd by any mutual emulation or rivalſhip, that it continued to their death; and it is thought that after their maſter's death, <hi>Pynſon</hi> prevail'd upon him to leave <hi>Westminster,</hi> and to come and ſettle nearer to him, which he accordingly did. What makes this more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable is, that the laſt edition of <hi>Caxton</hi> is dated, as we have ſhewn, <hi>anno</hi> 1502, and the firſt that <hi>De Worde</hi> printed in <hi>London,</hi> as far as we have been able to diſcover, is dated 1503. Theſe two were joined in
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0712300300:367"/>
the Printing of the king's year-books, as long as <hi>De Worde</hi> lived, which were afterwards continued by <hi>Pinſon;</hi> and this is a ſufficient teſtimony of his having been an excellent Printer, were there nothing elſe to aſſure us of it: for it is not to be ſuppos'd that he would have aſſociated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to any other. <hi>Pynſon</hi> ſtiles himſelf Printer to the king in ſome of his editions, probably from a grant he had for the printing of thoſe year-books above mention'd. For we neither find that he printed any bibles, or other books, for which patents were granted by the crown. I don't find that he uſed any rebus, but he either printed his name at length, or elſe only the two initial letters R. P. The liſt of his works is nothing ſo copious as thoſe of his aſſociate, tho' he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Printing at leaſt 34 years, as appears from the dates of his firſt and laſt edition, which makes me conclude that a great part of them are loſt.

                        <head>XV. RICHARD GRAFTON. MDXXXIX.</head>
                        <p>RICHARD GRAFTON, Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> from an indifferent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Hiſtorian, became a famous and eminent Printer. Among other of his works under the former character, we have his Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chronicle of <hi>England,</hi> in which he is a conſtant borrower from the bulkier work of <hi>Edward Hall</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of the Wars between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> wherein the Reader will find little worth notice, if we may believe Dr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> than the faſhions and changes of Dreſs in each King's Reign. As <hi>Grafton</hi> was not over judicious in the choice of this Author, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he in the compiling of his Abridgement; in ſo much that the learned <hi>Buchanan,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> doth not ſcruple to call him <hi>a very headleſs and unskilful Writer,</hi> tho' he has had the honour of being quoted by <hi>Stow,</hi> and other Hiſtorians.</p>
                        <p>THE occaſion of his turning Printer was his being pitch'd upon to procure an Edition of <hi>William Tyndal,</hi> alias <hi>Hickins</hi> Verſion of the New Teſtament, and afterwards of his Bible reviſed and corrected by <hi>Myles Coverdal,</hi> a learned <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryar, well learned in the <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues. Some impreſſions of the former had already been diſperſed about <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, but were bought up by <hi>Tonstal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> and been burnt at St. <hi>Paul's Croſs;</hi> and it was very dangerous to undertake the reprinting of ſuch a work in <hi>London</hi> upon that account. This made <hi>Grafton</hi> and his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate <hi>Edward Whitchurch</hi> reſolve to get it done at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> whither they likewiſe ſent <hi>Coverdal</hi> to correct the Preſs. This proved a very expenſive work, and the impreſſion of the Bible alone coſt them <hi>500l.</hi> a great ſum in thoſe days. When it was brought over into <hi>England,</hi> it met with great oppoſition from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, they having ſome time before obtain'd a Royal Proclamation, to prohibit and aboliſh that among other heretical books; and, had not <hi>Bonner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford</hi> bought up the greateſt part of the Copies in order to deſtroy them, the undertakers muſt have been infallibly ruin'd. This Edition is ſuppos'd to have been printed <hi>anno</hi> 1535.</p>

                           <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0712300300:383"/>
HIS New Teſtament met with worſe fate, of which we have an authentick teſtimony extant in the Library of the Honourable Earl of <hi>Pembroke, viz.</hi> two Editions of it printed at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the ſame year, <hi>viz. anno</hi> 1434, one of which has a Preface prefix'd to it, to juſtify that Edition, from the other of the ſame year printed under his name, but ſtrangely mutilated and miſprinted. A more particular account of which is given in the Introduction to <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Bible lately publiſh'd.</p>
                        <p>FINDING that a verſion of the Bible was as much deſir'd by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the Reformation, as it was cry'd down by the enemies of it, they ventur'd to print a ſecond edition of it under the patronage of Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cromwell.</hi> But <hi>Tyndal</hi> having been by that time burnt as a heretick in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and his name growing then ſomewhat ignominious, they thought fit to publiſh it under the name of <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Bible, tho' <hi>Tyndal</hi> is affirm'd to have finiſh'd all but the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> as ſome, or as far as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as others affirm. <hi>Grafton</hi> having finiſh'd the printing of it preſented it to his two great Patrons, by whom, at his requeſt, it was likewiſe preſented to the King to whom it was dedicated. It had theſe words in red letters printed at the bottom of the title-page <hi>ſet forth with the King's moſt gracious licence.</hi> But, as they were ſuſpected to have been foiſted in, <hi>Grafton</hi> obtain'd leave to have it further licenſed under the privy ſeal. Soon after this it being obſerved how acceptable an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible was to the people, ſome perſons form'd a deſign to print it in a ſmaller volume, in order to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſell <hi>Grafton</hi>'s, which obliged him to apply to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and to obtain a patent from the King, that none ſhould print it for three years; and for the better ſale of this, that noble man did likewiſe procure him an order that every Curate of a pariſh ſhould be obliged to have one, and every Abby ſix of them; ſo that this ſecond impreſſion, wherever print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was very ſoon bought up.</p>
                        <p>GRAFTON and his partners in the work obſerving that there was ſtill a call for them, reſolved to reprint it a third time, and in a larger vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, but without theſe notes and prologues which they obſerv'd had given ſome offence. <hi>Paris</hi> was the place pitch'd upon to print it at, and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who favour'd the enterprize, procured letters from King <hi>Henry</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>to permit a ſubject of his to print the</hi> Engliſh
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0712300300:384"/>
                           <hi>Bible in the univerſity of</hi> Paris, <hi>becauſe of the goodneſs of the</hi> French <hi>paper and workmen. Bonner,</hi> then Ambaſſador from <hi>England</hi> to the Court, had likewiſe orders <hi>to aſſist the undertakers of that good work in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſuits. Bonner</hi> obtain'd not only the deſir'd licence, but likewiſe letters patents for printing this Bible, and for conveying it ſafe over to <hi>England.</hi> This edition, being thus encourag'd, went briſkly on to the end; but <hi>Bonner,</hi> who never liked the work, and did only promote it to make his court to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> found means to obſtruct it privately, notwithſtanding the King's patents.</p>
                        <p>ACCORDINGLY, <hi>anno</hi> 1438, the Printers were taken up, and charged with hereſy, by order of the Faculty, and <hi>Coverdale</hi> the corrector, <hi>Grafton</hi> the Head Printer, and other <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who contributed to the charges of the impreſſion, were ſent for; but they foreſeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, fled away as faſt as they could, and left the whole impreſſion which was juſt finiſh'd, and conſiſted of 2500 Copies, behind them. This was immediately ſeiz'd by the Lieutenant Criminal, and order'd to be burnt, except ſome few which he ſold, through covetouſneſs, for waſte-paper, which were afterwards bought up again, being about four fats or cheſts full.</p>
                        <p>MY Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi> favour'd me with the ſight of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible printed in <hi>Gothic</hi> characters, <hi>an.</hi> 1537. without place or Printer's name, with theſe words at the end;</p>
                        <p>The end of the New Teſtament, and of the whole Byble.</p>
                        <p>¶ To the Honoure and Prayſe of Gode was this Byble prynted and fyneſhed in the yere of oure Lorde Gode. a M D XXXVII.</p>
                        <p>BUT whether this is one of them that were printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> or one of the former edition I cannot determine; but it is more probable to be the latter, becauſe it has a Concordance of the moſt remarkable texts of Scripture againſt the errors of Popery: whereas, as I obſerv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they had ſuppreſs'd moſt things of that nature in the <hi>Paris</hi> one. But let this be of what edition it will, it is very probable that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance proved the cauſe of the almoſt total deſtruction of it, in ſo much that I queſtion whether there be any other copy of it left except this above mention'd. However, <hi>Grafton</hi> and his aſſociates, by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0712300300:385"/>
encouragement, went ſoon after to <hi>Paris,</hi> and got the preſſes, letters and workmen, and brought them over to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo ſet up for Printers themſelves, which they never intended before, and began to reprint the ſame Bible, which they finiſh'd in 1537; an account of which you'll find in the following liſt of <hi>Grafton</hi>'s works.</p>
                        <p>WE find a patent in <hi>Rymer's faedera,</hi> vol. 17. p. 766. from King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VIII. appointing him and his partner <hi>Whitchurch</hi> to print the Book of divine ſervice; but, as I have not been able to meet with the Book, I have not inſerted it in the liſt.

I ventur'd to affirm after <hi>Orlandi</hi> and other Annaliſts, that the invention of ingraving began much about the ſame time with that of Printing; but I have been ſince convinced, that the former began much earlier, from a curious collection which my Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi> was pleaſed to ſhow me, in which the whole progreſs of that invention is ſet down in writing under each print. Having therefore obtain'd his Lordſhip's leave to copy it from his own book, and to give it a place in this work, I think I cannot better conclude this Hiſtory than by obliging the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with this valuable collection.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX To the GENERAL HISTORY of PRINTING of BOOKS: BEING AN ADDITIONAL HISTORY OF THE RISE and PROGRESS of <hi>PRINTS,</hi> Which are Incus'd.</head>
            <p>Exactly copy'd from the R. H. the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s curious Book of thoſe PRINTS, in which each Piece hath its own particular account of its manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Manuſcript, in a right progreſſive order, as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. ANTONIO POLLAIOLOLO nat. 1426. ob. 1498. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinucci</hi> ſays that he engraved the Battle at <hi>Florence</hi> about 1460, and that <hi>Andrea Montegna</hi> graved his Triumph at <hi>Rome</hi> ſoon after his being there. They both graved upon Pewter. The former printed his name on it thus, <hi>Opus Antonij Pollaiololo Florentini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Iſrael van Meckenem</hi> his own Effigies.</p>

3. This <hi>Iſrael van Meckenem</hi> is by ſome authors called <hi>Van Mecklin</hi> &amp; <hi>Mentz</hi> &amp; <hi>Moguntin. Lomazero</hi> ſays he was the firſt that engraved; he was Maſter to <hi>Bon Martino,</hi> who was Maſter to <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> whoſe firſt Print was a Copy after this of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s <hi>an.</hi> 1497. and as <hi>Baldinucci</hi> ſays <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not engrave till he had ſeen the Triumph of <hi>Ant. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegno, anno</hi> 1467, which is the oldeſt date that any author has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and the termination being <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> ſhows that the art ſpread very ſoon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A. M.</hi> was, as is ſuppoſed, <hi>Andrea de Murano</hi> 1412. This Print is upon that mixt metal on which Goldſmiths uſed to engrave their firſt proofs. It is now likewiſe uſed by other artiſts. Founders call it the hard metal, and Printers the Type-metal, tho' the latter has a greater proportion of Iron. The other materials are Lead, Block-tin, and Regulus of Antimony. <hi>Albert Durer</hi> began by copying of old Prints, as you will ſee when you come to him; this Print is older than that of 1467, which ſtands by it, which was taken to be the oldeſt of any one with a date by the author, who mentions this for want of knowing of that. As for the year 1412 above mention'd it agrees with the time in which <hi>A. de Murano</hi> flouriſh'd; and <hi>Baldinucci</hi> ſpeaks in one place as if other authors were uncertain how near 1400 the invention of Prints was. Yet he ſeems to ſay that <hi>Maſo Finiguerri</hi> was not long before <hi>Pollaiololo,</hi> who follow'd <hi>Baccio Baldini,</hi> who imitated <hi>Maſo</hi> the inventor of Prints, by taking off ſome from engraved ſilver work to ſee the impreſſion: but, unleſs he did ſo ſome years before, this Print muſt be older.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Andrea Montegna</hi> N. 1431. <hi>an.</hi> 1517. The next after <hi>Pollaiololo</hi> who engraved in <hi>Italy.</hi> His beſt works were after the Antique. But this firſt is none of the nine which he compoſed from the Antiques.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth in order of his painting. This is his original Print; they have ſince finiſhed (within theſe outlines) the Prints that are commonly ſold for it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This was printed when they uſed the ſmoke of a candle inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

8. <hi>Mich. Angelo</hi> on ſilk. This is only from a drawing, the painting of which has much more in it, and is to be ſeen in my Lord's Gallery. This is the firſt Print that is not upon Paper.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The <hi>Suavius</hi> was the firſt Print done on two Copper-plates. This Print, beſides the blue ground, has the figure of old <hi>Time</hi> clipping <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>'s wings. After this <hi>Perrier</hi> did engrave this, and then the five more on three Copper-plates, as <hi>Carpi</hi> did upon wood.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Head of <hi>Lutma</hi> the Father, done with the hammer; the black and white diſpoſed contrary to Mezotinto. <hi>Per Janum Lutma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. In this <hi>John Lutma</hi> has added graving to the hammering.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Jacobus Lutma</hi> mixed etching with engraving.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mavors (Mars)</hi> by <hi>Joannes Collaert.</hi> This is the only Print that ever was graved on Steel.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Dominico Campagnola,</hi> the firſt that printed with red on a black ground.</p>
            <p n="15">15. This manner, which was invented in <hi>Germany,</hi> differs from all Prints, becauſe the ink riſes upon the paper.</p>
            <p n="16">16. This, done by <hi>J. S.</hi> (as in the ſhield) came from <hi>Venice;</hi> the lines are not engraved, but made by Points.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Four Mezotinto's varying from the common manner of thoſe Prints. In this the figure (our Saviour on the Croſs) is engraved, the reſt is done in Mezotinto, the other three are each in a different colour.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Mr. <hi>Tayler</hi> a Painter, who improved the printing of Stuffs in <hi>Holland,</hi> he invented this Art of printing in colours; and Mr. <hi>Le Blond</hi> (though he might take the hint from this) has further improved it by printing his pieces ſo as to look like painting; the firſt that he did in this kind was after the <hi>Baroccio</hi> in my Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s gallery.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The firſt Print of <hi>Martin Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="20">20. <hi>Iſrael van Meckenem.</hi> This is the only one of his that has the place's name, <hi>viz. Tzù</hi> (at) <hi>Boackholt.</hi>

            <p n="21">21. The firſt Print of <hi>Albert Durer</hi> 1497, which is a Copy after <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s. He engraved this alſo upon Pewter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albert Durer nat.</hi> 1470, <hi>ob.</hi> 1528, was famous for cutting on Wood, and all other manners of ingraving, as may be ſeen by theſe four that follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1ſt. Engraved on Pewter, which was his firſt manner.</p>
            <p>2d. Cut on Wood, and on three planches.</p>
            <p>3d. Engraved on Copper, in which he was the firſt and the beſt, and was imitated by <hi>Mark Antonio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4th. Etched, being the firſt of that kind.</p>
            <p n="22">22. <hi>Maſo Finiguerra,</hi> a Goldſmith at <hi>Florence,</hi> the inventer of Prints, tho' he made no Print till after <hi>A. Pollaiololo. Albert Durer</hi> copy'd this ſo as to ſtand the ſame way as the Original. They ſtand each by the other in the book.</p>
            <p n="23">23. <hi>Albert Durer</hi> made this piece in imitation of the oldeſt Print, which was graved, <hi>anno</hi> 1412.</p>
            <p n="24">24. This bears the oldeſt date of all his, whether on Wood or Copper. This is alſo dated 1502, but the mark differs from his uſual mark.</p>
            <p n="25">25. If <hi>Hugo Carpi</hi> was the inventor of Printing upon three planches, he muſt have been very young; for he was but 18 years old when <hi>A. Durer</hi> did this in 1522, which is the Head of <hi>Ulricus Var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="26">26. The firſt Print etch'd upon Iron by <hi>A. Durer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="27">27. Another of his of <hi>anno</hi> 1518, in which he perfected the Art of etching on Iron, even before <hi>Parmigiano;</hi> tho' this laſt in <hi>Italy</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to have been the firſt Etcher.</p>

               </gap> that of his Maſter.</p>
            <p n="29">29. The firſt Print on Copper by <hi>A. Durer,</hi> with his mark before he began to date; this is his firſt manner.</p>
            <p n="30">30. This is without croſs-ſtrokes; <hi>Melaine</hi>'s manner is a fine improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this.</p>
            <p n="31">31. This piece is dated 1502, and bears the oldeſt date either on Copper or Wood.</p>
            <p n="32">32. One of 1504. This <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were the chief of his laſt manner, vaſtly neat, and imitated by <hi>Marc Antonio</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> This is reckoned more ſcarce than his St. <hi>Jerom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="33">33. The St. <hi>Jerom.</hi> This the <hi>Bolonia</hi> edition of <hi>Vaſari</hi> calls <hi>La Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viglia,</hi> or the prodigy of Art.</p>
            <p n="34">34. The laſt piece that <hi>Durer</hi> engrav'd. It is the head of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and is dated 1526.</p>
            <p n="35">35. A Crucifix engraved on a golden head of the Emperor's Cane. It was ſold for 150 Gilders, and is the only Print taken from Gold; that of <hi>An. Caracci</hi> is only from a ſilver ſalver. My Lord has it: there is but this one Print of it, which he took off as a proof before it was gilt.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The famous Bag-piper by <hi>Lucas van Leyden.</hi> This is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, which was ſold for 60 Duccatoons. The Copy, which ſtands next to it, is pretty ſcarce. Theſe two, and that on the gold cane, were on one Cartoon in the <hi>Arundel</hi> Collection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B. Incuſed</hi> is the proper term to ſignify thoſe plates which bear the ink between the lines of the graving, as <hi>excuſed</hi> is of thoſe that have it on the face of the line. Thus the prints in the <hi>Paginae Conglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinatae</hi> were <hi>excuſed,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Albert Durer incuſed,</hi> he being the firſt inventor of this manner, as being cheaper, and eaſier cut than upon copper.</p>

As to Prints, <hi>Marolles</hi> had more than 50 times as many. In his 1ſt book he ſays he had above 120,000; and in his 2d he added about 50,000 more. (The King of <hi>France</hi> has ſince bought them). But he gathered all, and of all ſorts that he could find, well or ill preſerv'd: as for intire books graved, there are very many, but here are only thoſe of <hi>Italian</hi> Painters, antiquities excepted; as for looſe Prints, only 14 volumes, as follows.</p>
               <p>IN the firſt 4 volumes of Prints are above 1500, each by a different maſter, ending with <hi>Edelinck, Andran,</hi> and their diſciples, engraving and etching being brought to perfection by them.</p>

Explicit Liber quartus</p>
            <p>Dialogorum Gregorii.</p>
            <p>Finding in this Book of My Lord's, that what was in Red was Printed, made me Print what I have ſay'd of it; but my Lord, not approving of it, I promiſed to Print at the end of the Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta what his Lordſhip had writ at the beginning of his Book, as follows:</p>
            <p>I bought this Book, becauſe it is Printed before they made uſe of Matrices to caſt ſingle Letters. From the variation of the Shapes of the ſame Letters, it appears to be Wooden Movable Types: As for the Red I told the man, that I believ'd there was ſome Cheat in it, becauſe I had ſome Months before ſuch a Book, printed without the Red, brought to me by an other Perſon, who ask'd me more for it then I car'd to give. The Paper has the Bull's Head, on which <hi>Fauſt,</hi> &amp;c. printed, and is reckon'd to be older than any dated by <hi>Fauſt,</hi> and ſo older than the Date here in Red.</p>
