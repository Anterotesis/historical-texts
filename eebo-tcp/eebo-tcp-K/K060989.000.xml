            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS relation is Matter of Fact, and attended with ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as may induce any Reaſonable Man to believe it. It was ſent by a Gentleman, a Juſtice of Peace at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and a very Intelligent Perſon, to his Friend in <hi>London,</hi> as it is here Worded; which Diſcourſe is atteſted by a very ſober and underſtanding Gentlewoman, a Kinſwoman of the ſaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans, who lives in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> within a few Doors of the Houſe in whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the within named Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> lives; who believes his Kinſwoman to be of ſo diſcerning a Spirit, as not to be put upon by any Fallacy, and who poſſitively aſſured him, that the whole Matter, as it is here Related and laid down, is what is really True; and what She her ſelf had in the ſame Words (as near as may be) from Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi> own Mouth, who ſhe knows had no Reaſon to Invent and publiſh ſuch a Story, nor any deſign to forge and tell a Lye, being a Woman of much Honeſty and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and her whole Life a Courſe as it were of Piety. The uſe which we ought to make of it is, to conſider, That there is a Life to come after this, and a Juſt God, who will retribute to every one according to the Deeds done in the Body; and therefore, to reflect upon our Paſt courſe of Life we have led in the World; That our Time is Short and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain, and that if we would eſcape the Puniſhment of the Ungodly, and receive the Reward of the Righteous, which is the laying hold of Eternal Life, we ought for the time to come, to turn to God by a ſpeedy Repentance, ceaſing to do Evil and Learning to do Well: To ſeek after God Early, if happily he may be found of us, and lead ſuch Lives for the future, as may be well pleaſing in his ſight.</p>

            <head>A RELATION OF THE APPARITION Of Mrs. VEAL.</head>
            <p>THIS thing is ſo rare in all its Circumſtances, and on ſo good Authority, that my Reading and Converſation has not given me any thing like it; it is fit to gratifie the moſt Ingenious and Serious Enquirer. Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> is the Perſon to whom Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> Appeared after her Death; ſhe is my Intimate Friend, and I can avouch for her Reputation, for theſe laſt fifteen or ſixteen Years, on my own Knowledge; and I can confirm the Good Character ſhe had from her Youth, to the time of my Acquaintance. Tho' ſince this Relation, ſhe is Calumniated by ſome People, that are Friends to the Brother of Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> who Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; who think the Relation of this Appearance to be a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and endeavour what they can to Blaſt Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi>'s Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to Laugh the Story out of Countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof, and the Chearful Diſpoſition of Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> notwithſtanding the unheard of ill Uſage of a very Wicked Husband, there is not the leaſt ſign of Dejection in her Face; nor did I ever hear her let fall a Deſponding or Murmuring Expreſſion; nay, not when actually under her Husbands Barbarity; which I have been Witneſs to, and ſeveral other Perſons of undoubted Reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0696600100:4"/>Now you muſt know, that Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was a Maiden Gentlewoman of about 30 Years of Age, and for ſome Years laſt paſt, had been troubled with Fits; which were perceived coming on her, by her going off from her Diſcourſe very abruptly, to ſome impertinence: She was maintain'd by an only Brother, and kept his Houſe in <hi>Dover.</hi> She was a very Pious Woman, and her Brother a very Sober Man to all appearance: But now he does all he can to Null or Quaſh the Story. Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was intimately acquainted with Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> from her Childhood. Mrs <hi>Veals</hi> Circumſtances were then Mean; her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not take care of his Children as he ought, ſo that they were expoſed to Hardſhips: And Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> in thoſe days, had as Unkind a Father, tho' She wanted for neither Food nor Cloathing, whilſt Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> wanted for both: So that it was in the Power of Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> to be very much her Friend in ſeveral Inſtances, which mightily endear'd Mrs <hi>Veal</hi>; inſomuch that ſhe would often ſay, Mrs. <hi>Bargrave you are not only the Beſt, but the only Friend I have in the World; and no Circumſtances of Life, ſhall ever diſſolve my Friendſhip.</hi> They would often Condole each others adverſe Fortune, and read together, <hi>Drelincourt upon Death,</hi> and other good Books: And ſo like two Chriſtian Friends, they comforted each other under their Sorrow.</p>
            <p>Sometime after, Mr. <hi>Veals</hi> Friends got him a Place in the Cuſtom-Houſe at <hi>Dover,</hi> which occaſioned Mrs <hi>Veal</hi> by little and little, to fall off from her Intimacy with Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> tho' there was never any ſuch thing as a Quarrel; but an Indifferency came on by degrees, till at laſt Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> had not ſeen her in two Years and a half; tho' above a Twelve Month of the time, Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> had been abſent from <hi>Dover,</hi> and this laſt half Year, has been in <hi>Canterbury</hi> about two Months of the time, dwelling in a Houſe of her own.</p>
            <p>In this Houſe, on the Eighth of <hi>September</hi> laſt, <hi>viz</hi> 1705. She was ſitting alone in the Forenoon, thinking over her Unfortunate Life, and arguing her ſelf into a due Reſignation to Providence, tho' her condition ſeem'd hard. And ſaid ſhe, <hi>I have been provided for hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and doubt not but I ſhall be ſtill, and am well ſatisfied, that my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions ſhall end, when it is moſt fit for me:</hi> And then took up her Sewing-Work, which ſhe had no ſooner done, but ſhe hears a Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Door; ſhe went to ſee who it was there, and this prov'd to be Mrs. <hi>Veal,</hi> her Old Friend, who was in a Riding Habit: At that Moment of Time, the Clock ſtruck Twelve at Noon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0696600100:5"/>Madam ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> I am ſurprized to ſee you, you have been ſo long a ſtranger, but told her, ſhe was glad to ſee her and offer'd to Salute her, which Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> complyed with, till their Lips almoſt touched, and then Mrs <hi>Veal</hi> drew her hand croſs her own Eyes, and ſaid, <hi>I am not very well,</hi> and ſo waved it. She told Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> ſhe was going a Journey, and had a great mind to ſee her firſt: But ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, how came you to take a Journey alone? I am amaz'd at it, becauſe I know you have ſo fond a Brother.</hi> O! ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal, I gave my Brother the Slip, and came away, becauſe I had ſo great a Mind to ſee you before I took my Journy.</hi> So Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> went in with her, into another Room within the firſt, and Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> ſat her ſelf down in an Elbow-chair, in which Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> was ſitting when ſhe heard Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> Knock. Then ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal, My Dear Friend, I am come to renew our Old Friendſhip again, and to beg your Pardon for my breach of it, and if you can forgive me you are one of the beſt of Women.</hi> O! ſays Mrs. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, don't mention ſuch a thing, I have not had an uneaſie thought about it, I can eaſily forgive it.</hi> What did you think of me ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal?</hi> Says Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, I thought you were like the reſt of the World, and that Proſperity had made you forget your ſelf and me.</hi> Then Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> reminded Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> of the many Friendly Offices ſhe did her in former Days, and much of the Converſation they had with each other in the time of their Adverſity; what Books they Read, and what Comfort in particular they received from <hi>Drelincourt</hi>'s, <hi>Book of Death,</hi> which was the beſt ſhe ſaid on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was ever Wrote. She alſo mentioned Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and two <hi>Dutch</hi> Books which were Tranſlated, Wrote upon Death, and ſeveral others: But <hi>Drelincourt</hi> ſhe ſaid, had the cleareſt Notions of Death, and of the Future State, of any who have handled that Subject. Then ſhe asked Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> whether ſhe had <hi>Drelincourt</hi>; ſhe ſaid yes. Says Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> fetch it, and ſo Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> goes up Stairs, and brings it down. Says Mrs. <hi>Veal,</hi> Dear Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, If the Eyes of our Faith were as open as the Eyes of our Body, we ſhould ſee numbers of Angels about us for our Guard: The Notions we have of Heaven now, are nothing like what it is, as</hi> Drelincourt <hi>ſays. Therefore be comforted under your Afflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to you; and that your Afflictions are Marks of Gods Favour: And when they have done the buſineſs they were ſent for, they ſhall be removed from you.</hi> And believe me my Dear Friend, believe what I ſay to you, <hi>One Minute of future Happineſs will infinitely reward you for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0696600100:6"/>
all your Sufferings. For I can never believe,</hi> (and claps her Hand upon her Knee, with a great deal of Earneſtneſs, which indeed ran through all her Diſcourſe) <hi>that ever God will ſuffer you to ſpend all your Days in this Afflicted State: But be aſſured, that your Afflictions ſhall leave you, or you them in a ſhort time.</hi> She ſpake in that Pathetical and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manner, that Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> wept ſeveral times; ſhe was ſo deeply affected with it. Then Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> mentioned Dr. <hi>Hornecks Aſcetick,</hi> at the end of which, he gives an account of the Lives of the Primitive Chriſtians. <hi>Their Pattern ſhe recommended to our Imitation</hi>; and ſaid, <hi>their Converſation was not like this of our Age. For now</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>there is nothing but frothy vain Diſcourſe, which is far different from theirs. Theirs was to Edification, and to Build one another up in the Faith: So that they were not as we are, nor are we as they are; but</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>We might do as they did. There was a Hearty Friendſhip among them, but where is it now to be found?</hi> Says Mrs. Bargrave, <hi>'tis hard indeed to find a true Friend in theſe days.</hi> Says Mrs. <hi>Veal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> has a Fine Coppy of Verſes, call'd <hi>Friendſhip in Perfection,</hi> which I wonderfully admire, have you ſeen the Book ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi>? No, ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, but I have the Verſes of my own writing out. Have you,</hi> ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal, then fetch them</hi>; which ſhe did from above Stairs, and offer'd them to Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> to read, who refuſed, and wav'd the thing, ſaying, <hi>holding down her Head would make it ake,</hi> and then deſired Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> to read them to her, which ſhe did. As they were admiring Friendſhip, Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> ſaid, Dear Mrs. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> I ſhall love you for ever: In the Verſes, there is twice uſed the Word <hi>Elyſium.</hi> Ah! ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal, Theſe Poets have ſuch Names for Heaven.</hi> She would often draw her Hand croſs her own Eyes; and ſay, Mrs. <hi>Bargrave Don't you think I am mightily impaired by my Fits?</hi> No, ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> I think you look as well as ever I knew you.</p>
            <p>After all this diſcourſe, which the Apparition put in Words much finer than Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> ſaid ſhe could pretend to, and was much more than ſhe can remember (for it cannot be thought, that an hour and three quarters Converſation could all be retained, tho' the main of it, ſhe thinks ſhe does.) She ſaid to Mrs. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, ſhe would have her write a Letter to her Brother, and tell him, ſhe would have him give Rings to ſuch and ſuch; and that there was a Purſe of Gold in her Cabinet, and that ſhe would have Two Broad Pieces given to her Couſin Watſon.</hi> Talking at this Rate, Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> thought that a Fit was coming upon her, and ſo placed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0696600100:7"/>
her ſelf in a Chair, juſt before her Knees, to keep her from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Ground, if her Fits ſhould occaſion it; for the Elbow Chair ſhe thought would keep her from falling on either ſide. And to divert Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> as ſhe thought, ſhe took hold of her Gown Sleeve ſeveral times, and commended it. Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> told her, it was a Scower'd Silk, and newly made up. But for all this Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> perſiſted in her Requeſt, and told Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> ſhe muſt not deny her: and ſhe would have her tell her Brother all their Converſation, when ſhe had an opportunity. Dear Mrs. <hi>Veal,</hi> ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, this ſeems ſo impertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a mortifying Story will our Converſation be to a Young Gentleman?</hi> Well, ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal, I muſt not be deny'd.</hi> Why, ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, 'tis much better methinks to do it your ſelf,</hi> No, ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal; tho' it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to you now, you will ſee more reaſon for it hereafter.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> then to ſatisfie her importunity, was going to fetch a Pen and Ink; but Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> ſaid, <hi>let it alone now, and do it when I am gone; but you muſt be ſure to do it:</hi> which was one of the laſt things ſhe enjoin'd her at parting; and ſo ſhe promiſed her.</p>
            <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> asked for Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi> Daughter; ſhe ſaid ſhe was not at home; but if you have a mind to ſee her ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> I'le ſend for her. <hi>Do,</hi> ſays Mrs. <hi>Veal.</hi> On which ſhe left her, and went to a Neighbours, to ſend for her; and by the Time Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> was returning, Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was got without the Door in the Street, in the face of the <hi>Beaſt-Market</hi> on a Saturday (which is Market day) and ſtood ready to part, as ſoon as Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> came to her. She askt her, <hi>why ſhe was in ſuch haſt?</hi> ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe muſt be going; tho' perhaps ſhe might not go her journey till Monday.</hi> And told <hi>Mrs.</hi> Bargrave <hi>ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould ſee her again, at her Couſin</hi> Watſons <hi>before ſhe went whether ſhe was a going.</hi> Then ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe would not take her Leave of her,</hi> and walk'd from Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> in her view, till a turning interrupted the ſight of her, which was three quarters after One in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> Dyed the 7th of <hi>September</hi> at 12 a Clock at Noon, of her Fits, and had not above four hours Senſes before her Death, in which time ſhe received the Sacrament. The next day after Mrs. <hi>Veals</hi> appearing being Sunday, Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> was mightily indiſpoſed with a Cold, and a Sore Throat, that ſhe could not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0696600100:8"/>
go out that day: but on Monday morning ſhe ſends a perſon to Captain <hi>Watſons</hi> to know if Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> were there. They won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi> enquiry, and ſent her Word, that ſhe was not there, nor was expected. At this Anſwer Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> told the Maid ſhe had certainly miſtook the Name, or made ſome blunder. And tho' ſhe was ill, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> put on her Hood, and went her ſelf to Captain <hi>Watſons,</hi> tho' ſhe knew none of the Family, to ſee if Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was there or not. They ſaid, they wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her asking, for that ſhe had not been in Town; they were ſure, if ſhe had, ſhe would have been there. Says Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, I am ſure ſhe was with me on Saturday almoſt two hours.</hi> They ſaid it was impoſſible, for they muſt have ſeen her if ſhe had. In comes Captain <hi>Watſon,</hi> while they were in Diſpute, and ſaid that Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was certainly Dead, and her Eſcocheons were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. This ſtrangely ſurpriſed Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> who went to the Perſon immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. Then ſhe related the whole Story to Captain <hi>Watſons</hi> Family, and what Gown ſhe had on, and how ſtriped. And that Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> told her it was Scowred. Then Mrs. <hi>Watſon</hi> cry'd out, <hi>you have ſeen her indeed, for none knew but</hi> Mrs. <hi>Veal and my ſelf, that the Gown was Scowr'd</hi>; and Mrs <hi>Watſon</hi> own'd that ſhe deſcribed the Gown exactly; for, ſaid ſhe, <hi>I helpt her to make it up.</hi> This, Mrs. <hi>Watſon</hi> blaz'd all about the Town, and avouch'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Truth of Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi> ſeeing Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi>'s Apparition. And Captain <hi>Watſon</hi> carried two Gentlemen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi> Houſe, to hear the Relation from her own Mouth. And then it ſpread ſo faſt, that Gentlemen and Perſons of Quality, the Judicious and Sceptical part of the World, flock't in upon her, which at laſt became ſuch a Task, that ſhe was forc'd to go out of the way. For they were in general, extreamly ſatisfyed of the truth of the thing; and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw, that Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> was no Hypochondriack, for ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appears with ſuch a chearful Air, and pleaſing Mien, that ſhe has gain'd the favor and eſteem of all the Gentry. And its thought a great favor if they can but get the Relation from her own Mouth. I ſhould have told you before, that Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> told Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> that her Siſter and Brother in Law, were juſt come down from <hi>London</hi> to ſee her. Says Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, how came you to order matters ſo ſtrangely? it could not be helpt ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi>; and her Siſter and Brother did come to ſee her, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0696600100:9"/>
entred the Town of <hi>Dover,</hi> juſt as Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was expiring. Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> asked her, whether ſhe would not drink ſome Tea. Says Mrs. <hi>Veal, I do not care if I do: But I'le Warrant this Mad Fellow</hi> (meaning Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi> Husband,) <hi>has broke all your Trinckets.</hi> But, ſays Mrs. <hi>Bargrave, I'le get ſomething to Drink in for all that</hi>; but Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> wav'd it, and ſaid, <hi>it is no matter, let it alone,</hi> and ſo it paſſed.</p>
            <p>All the time I ſat with Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> which was ſome Hours, ſhe recollected freſh ſayings of Mrs. <hi>Veal.</hi> And one material thing more ſhe told Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> that Old Mr. <hi>Breton</hi> allowed Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> Ten pounds a Year, which was a ſecret, and unknown to Mrs. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> till Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> told it her. Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> never varies in her Story, which puzzles thoſe who doubt of the Truth, or are unwilling to believe it. A Servant in a Neighbours Yard adjoining to Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi> Houſe, heard her talking to ſome body, an hour of the Time Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was with her. Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> went out to her next Neighbours the very Moment ſhe parted with Mrs. <hi>Veal,</hi> and told what Raviſhing Converſation ſhe had with an Old Friend, and told the whole of it. <hi>Drelincourt</hi>'s <hi>Book of Death</hi> is, ſince this happened, Bought up ſtrangely. And it is to be obſerved, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this Trouble and Fatigue Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> has undergone upon this Account, ſhe never took the value of a Farthing, nor ſuffer'd her Daughter to take any thing of any Body, and therefore can have no Intereſt in telling the Story.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Veal</hi> does what he can to ſtifle the matter, and ſaid he would ſee Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi>; but yet it is certain matter fact, that he has been at Captain <hi>Watſons</hi> ſince the Death of his Siſter, and yet never went near Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi>; and ſome of his Friends report her to be a great Lyar, and that ſhe knew of Mr. <hi>Breton</hi>'s Ten Pounds a Year. But the Perſon who pretends to ſay ſo, has the Reputation of a Notorious Lyar, among perſons which I know to be of undoubted Repute. Now Mr. <hi>Veal</hi> is more a Gentleman, than to ſay ſhe Lyes; but ſays, a bad Husband has Craz'd her. But ſhe needs only to preſent her ſelf, and it will effectually confute that Pretence. Mr. <hi>Veal</hi> ſays he ask'd his Siſter on her Death Bed, whether ſhe had a mind to diſpoſe of any thing, and ſhe ſaid, No. Now what the things which Mrs. <hi>Veals</hi> Apparition would have diſpoſed of, were ſo Trifling, and nothing of Juſtice aimed at in their diſpoſal, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it appears to me to be only in order to make Mrs.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0696600100:10"/>
               <hi>Bargrave,</hi> ſo to demonſtrate the Truth of her Appearance, as to ſatisfie the World of the Reality thereof, as to what ſhe had ſeen and heard: and to ſecure her Reputation among the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and underſtanding part of Mankind. And then again, Mr. <hi>Veal</hi> owns that there was a Purſe of Gold; but it was not found in her Cabinet, but in a Comb-Box This looks impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for that Mrs. <hi>Watſon</hi> own'd that Mrs. <hi>Veal</hi> was ſo very careful of the Key of her Cabinet, that ſhe would truſt no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with it. And if ſo, no doubt ſhe would not truſt her Gold out of it. And Mrs. <hi>Veals</hi> often drawing her hand over her Eyes, and asking Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> whether her Fits had not impair'd her; looks to me, as if ſhe did it on purpoſe to remind Mrs. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of her Fits, to prepare her not to think it ſtrange that ſhe ſhould put her upon Writing to her Brother to diſpoſe of Rings and Gold, which lookt ſo much like a dying Perſons Bequeſt; and it took accordingly with Mrs. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> as the effect of her Fits coming upon her; and was one of the many Inſtances of her Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Love to her, and Care of her, that ſhe ſhould nor be affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which indeed appears in her whole management; particularly in her coming to her in the day time, waving the Salutation, and when ſhe was alone; and then the manner of her parting, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a ſecond attempt to Salute her.</p>
            <p>Now, why Mr. <hi>Veal</hi> ſhould think this Relation a Reflection, (as 'tis plain he does by his endeavouring to ſtifle it) I can't imagine, becauſe the Generality believe her to be a good Spirit, her Diſcourſe was ſo Heavenly. Her two great Errands were to comfort Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> in her Affliction, and to ask her Forgiveneſs for her Breach of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and with a Pious Diſcourſe to encourage her. So that after all, to ſuppoſe that Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> could Hatch ſuch an Invention as this from <hi>Friday-Noon,</hi> till <hi>Saturday-Noon,</hi> (ſuppoſing that ſhe knew of Mrs. <hi>Veals</hi> Death the very firſt Moment) without jumbling Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and without any Intereſt too; ſhe muſt be more Witty, Fortunate, and Wicked too, than any indifferent Perſon I dare ſay, will allow. I asked Mrs. <hi>Bargrave</hi> ſeveral times, <hi>If ſhe was ſure ſhe felt the Gown.</hi> She anſwered Modeſtly, <hi>if my Senſes be to be relied on, I am ſure of it.</hi> I asked her, <hi>If ſhe heard a Sound, when ſhe clapt her Hand upon her Knee:</hi> She ſaid, <hi>ſhe did not remember ſhe did:</hi> And ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe Appeared to be as much a Subſtance as I did, who talked with her. And I may</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>be as ſoon perſuaded that your Apparition is talking to me now, as that I did not really ſee her; for I was under no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0696600100:11"/>
manner of Fear, I received her as a Friend, and parted with her as ſuch. I would not,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>give one Farthing to make any one believe it, I have no Intereſt in it; nothing but trouble is entail'd upon me for a long time for ought that I know; and had it not come to Light by Accident, it would never have been made Publick</hi> But now ſhe ſays, <hi>ſhe will make her own Private <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it, and keep her ſelf out of the way as much as ſhe can.</hi> And ſo ſhe has done ſince. She ſays, <hi>ſhe had a Gentleman who came thirty Miles to her to hear the Relation; and that ſhe had told it to a Room full of People at a time.</hi> Several particular Gentlemen have had the Story from Mrs <hi>Bargraves</hi> own Mouth.</p>
            <p>This thing has very much affected me, and I am as well ſatisfied, as I am of the beſt grounded Matter of Fact. And why ſhould we diſpute Matter of Fact, becauſe we cannot ſolve things, of which we can have no certain or demonſtrative Notions, ſeems ſtrange to me: Mrs. <hi>Bargraves</hi>'s Authority and Sincerity alone, would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted in any other Caſe.</p>
