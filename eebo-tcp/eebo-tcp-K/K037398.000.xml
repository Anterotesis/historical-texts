            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is generally thought, that as Paſtorals are a kind of poetry, which has been touch'd upon by ſuch a number of poets, that they are eaſily compos'd, and that their thoughts and ſentiments muſt be trite and vulgar. However this opinion may be true in reaſon, I hope the following pieces will be exempt from it's cenſure, as they are form'd on a plan entirely new, and as their deſign is eſſentially diſtinguiſh'd from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of their kind, either ancient or modern: unleſs it be that the firſt and ninth Bucolic of Virgil are in the ſame nature. How the ideas of fields and woods, and a poetry whoſe very eſſence is a rural life, will agree with the polite taſte of the town, and of gentlemen who are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the faſhionable ornaments of life, is a queſtion: but I hope as they relate to that war, which is at preſent the moſt general topic of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, this unpoliteneſs will in ſome meaſure be excuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0122602800:3"/>
The learned reader will obſerve, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has endeavour'd to imitate the ſimplicity of the ancients in theſe pieces, as thinking it not only more particularly adapted to Paſtoral, but the true ornament of all kinds of poetry in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. As to the deſign of this work, I hope it will not be thought odd, or ill-choſen. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing intereſts of a peaceful and rural life, and the tumultuous ſcenes of war, together with the various ſtruggles and paſſions ariſing from thence, ſeem by no means an improper field for the moſt elegant writer to exerciſe his genius in. How far the author of theſe pieces has ſucceeded in the performance of this, is humbly ſubmitted to the cenſure and judgment of the public.</p>

               <l>ARISE, my Lycas: in yon' woody wilds</l>
               <l>From a rough rock in deep encloſure hid</l>
               <l>Of thickeſt oaks, a guſhing fountain falls,</l>
               <l>And pours it's airy ſtream with torrent pure:</l>
               <l>Which late returning from the field at eve</l>
               <l>I found, invited by it's daſhing ſound,</l>
               <l>As thro' the gloom it ſtruck my paſſing ear.</l>
               <l>Thither I mean to drive our languid flocks;</l>
               <l>Fit place to cool their thirſt in mid-day hour.</l>
               <l>Due weſt it rifes from that blaſted beech;</l>

               <l>Alas, my friend, of flock,</l>
               <l>Of ſpring, or ſhepherd's lore, to me is vain</l>
               <l>To tell: my fav'rite lamb, the ſolace dear</l>

               <l>On neighing ſteeds elate, in wide array</l>
               <l>Trampled the youngling, as the vale along</l>

               <l>Such throng I heard, as in the neighb'ring wood</l>
               <l>I wander'd to reduce a ſtraggling ewe</l>
               <l>Eſcap'd the fold: what time the grieſly owl</l>
               <l>Her ſhrieks began, and at the wonted elm</l>
               <l>The cows awaiting ſtood Lucilla's hand.</l>
               <l>When ſtrait with ſudden fear alarm'd I ſtart,</l>
               <l>And liſt'ning to the diſtant-echoing ſteps</l>
               <l>Of unſeen horſemen with attentive ear,</l>
               <l>I ſtand aloof. But why this deep-felt grief?</l>

               <l>Alphon, no more to Lycas now remains,</l>

               <l>Thou know'ſt my little flock; three tender ewes</l>
               <l>Were all my mean ambition wiſh'd or ſought.</l>
               <l>Ev'n now nine days, and nine revolving nights</l>
               <l>Are paſt, ſince theſe the Moldaw's raging flood</l>
               <l>Swept with their wattled cotes, as o'er it's banks</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0122602800:6"/> It roſe redundant, ſwoln with beating rains,</l>
               <l>And deep immers'd beneath it's whirling wave.</l>
               <l>I wak'd at early dawn, and to the field</l>
               <l>I iſſus'd to purſue my wonted toil,</l>
               <l>When lo! nor flocks, nor wattled cotes I ſaw;</l>
               <l>But all that met my wond'ring eyes around,</l>
               <l>Was deſolation ſad. Here ſtatelieſt oaks</l>
               <l>Torn from their roots, with broken branches lay</l>
               <l>In hideous ruin: there the fields, that laugh'd</l>
               <l>With rip'ning corn, of all their charms deſpoil'd,</l>
               <l>With oozy fragments ſcatter'd waſte and wild</l>
               <l>Were ſeen. I curſt the wicked ſpirit drear,</l>
               <l>That in the ruin'd abbey's darkeſt cell,</l>
               <l>(That ſtands immur'd amid yon' loneſome pines)</l>
               <l>I bound with triple chains: his magic pow'r</l>
               <l>Oft'times with howling ſtorms, and thunder loud</l>
               <l>Deforms the night, and blackens nature's face.</l>
               <l>His tempeſts ſwell'd the Moldaw's riſing ſtreams,</l>
               <l>And thus o'erwhelm'd my flock.—But this my heart</l>

               <l>But where did you, CALISTAN, ſhelter ſeek?</l>

               <l>CORIN, thou know'ſt the fur-clad hermit's cell</l>
               <l>Deep-arch'd beneath a rock among the wilds,</l>
               <l>Thither I bent my flight, a welcome gueſt,</l>
               <l>And not unknown; for when my flock I fed</l>
               <l>Of late beneath the neighb'ring paſtures green,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0122602800:30"/> I oft was wont, invited at his call,</l>
               <l>At noon beneath his cavern to retire</l>
               <l>From the ſun's heat, where all the paſſing hours</l>
               <l>The good old-man improv'd with converſe high,</l>
               <l>And in my breaſt enkindled virtue's love;</l>
               <l>Nor ſeldom would his hoſpitable hand</l>

               <l>Which o'er the wilds (his ſcanty food) he pluck'd:</l>
               <l>Here was my refuge.—All the live-long night</l>
               <l>Penſive by one, pale, loneſome lamp we ſate,</l>
               <l>And liſten'd to the bleak winds whiſtling loud,</l>
               <l>And the ſhrill craſh of foreſts from without.</l>
               <l>Soon as the morning dawn'd, the craggy height</l>
               <l>Of the ſteep rock I climb'd, on whoſe wild top</l>
               <l>His ruſtic temple ſtood, and moſs-grown croſs</l>
               <l>(The ſacred object of his pious pray'rs)</l>
               <l>Form'd of a tall fir's thunder-blaſted trunk:</l>
               <l>Where all beneath th' expanſive plains I ſaw</l>
               <l>With white pavilions hid, in deep array.</l>
               <l>There too my little fold, which late I left</l>
               <l>Standing at eve, amid the warlike ſcene</l>

was calm and mild,</l>
               <l>And all was peaceful. I remember well,</l>
               <l>While there within that fold my flock I pent,</l>
               <l>How blythe I heard my beauteous DELIA ſing!</l>
