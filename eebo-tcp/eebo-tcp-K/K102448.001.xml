            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE is no ſubject in the world upon which an author ſpeaks with a greater degree of latent pride, or a deeper air of outward humility, than his own productions.—He is perfectly ſenſible that they are trifles — yet he is bold enough to publiſh them —and while he ſeems to relinquiſh every title to the favourable opinion of the world, he returns his warmeſt thanks for paſt obligations, and indirectly tells us he has obtained it—thus the public are reduced to the agreeable alternative, either of acknowledging his merit, or reflecting upon their own judgment—and the conſequence generally is, that through a fear of diſparaging the credit of our taſte, or perſpicuity, we exalt him at once into a writer of conſummate modeſty, and uncommon abilities.</p>
            <p>THE author of the BABLER, however, wiſhes to ſteer between the extremes of an oſtentatious parade, and an affected diffidence; he would by no means preſumptuouſly place his pieces upon a forum with the eſſays of ſome cotemporaries, nor would he meanly ſink them to the level of others —a firſt-rate reputation is no leſs beyond his hopes, than his deſerts; yet if in the ſcale of honourable compariſon, he riſes with no capital degree of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0136400201:3"/>
he is ſatisfied that he cannot be the loweſt in the ballance of contempt.—This declaration he is the more emboldened to make, as during the courſe of his publication, he conſtantly had the honour of being re-printed by the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his literary fellow labourers in the vineyard of the public, and have been often happy enough to go through half a dozen editions, in half the number of days.</p>
            <p>IN the concluding number of theſe volumes the author has made ſome obſervations on the nature of eſſay writing in general, and rendered it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtibly evident, that there is no walk of genius, which lies under ſo many difficulties; yet of all the various eſſayiſts the news-paper drudge, is the moſt unfortunately circumſtanced; ſmall as the boundaries of a SPECTATOR, a RAMBLER, a WORLD, an ADVENTURER, or a CONNOISSEUR, may ſeem, the news-paper writer is under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of moving in a ſtill more contracted circle—the Printer (who on theſe occaſions is a very great man) does not ſo much conſider the importance of a writer's ſubject, as the immediate profit of the partners; it is not the improvement of the reader which he conſults, but the intereſt of the paper, or the topic of the day, and therefore often ſtints the eſſayiſt in room, to advertiſe a parcel of ſtolen goods, or to epitomize the trial of ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able murderer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0136400201:4"/>I REMEMBER when the BABLER was firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, I ſent an eſſay to the preſs, on which I had employed extraordinary pains; and which I warmly imagined would have procured me at leaſt a fortnight's reputation — the ſubject of the eſſay, was the abſurdity of party diſtinctions; but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, though I had endeavoured to contract myſelf within the moſt moderate limits, I had ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the prudential bounds of the Printer; — he accordingly brought me back the manuſcript, and declared it could not poſſibly be inſerted without undergoing ſome conſiderable amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions — It was in vain I argued with him on the importance of the ſubject, the ſpirit of the writing, and the credit it would certainly do his paper — the rogue was incorregibly dull; and told me if I would have it in, I muſt ſtrike a pen through the <hi>King,</hi> cut out lord <hi>Bute,</hi> and burn the people of <hi>England</hi> — Theſe conditions were too hard to be complied with — and I rather choſe to leave my admirable eſſay out entirely, than man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it to the taſte of an unfeeling blockhead, who appeared ſo glaringly callous to the beauties of a maſterly production.</p>
            <p>CIRCUMSCRIBED thus unhappily in my limits, the reader of judgment will not be ſurpriſed at finding, many ſubjects thrown frequently into little hiſtories, which otherwiſe ſituated, I ſhould have attempted to diſcuſs, on the methodical principles of a regular argument — As I had not room to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into elaborate diſquiſitions, it was my buſineſs
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0136400201:5"/>
to give the reader a little entertainment; and my duty at leaſt to amuſe his fancy, ſince I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to improve his underſtanding.</p>
            <p>THE principal matter which the author thinks himſelf under a neceſſity of apologizing for, is the ſimiliarity which the reader will find in ſome of the ſubjects; this was a circumſtance which, though the author was well aware, it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to the cenſure of the judicious, he could not conveniently avoid; as it was impoſſible to deliver himſelf fully on ſome points in a ſingle paper, he was under a neceſſity of reſuming ſuch as were moſt material to be diſcuſſed; he flatters himſelf however, that he will not be thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely reprehenſible on this account, ſince thoſe who are ſatisfied with the mere ſuperficials of a ſubject, may eaſily eſcape the repetitions, while thoſe who expect any information by proceeding, may as eaſily pardon the prolixity. Upon the whole, there is nothing in the volumes now offered to the public, for which the author could not urge ſome palliation; but his excuſes, perhaps, by treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſing on the readers patience, at a time they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not correct the minuteſt error in his performance, will themſelves ſtand in need of an apology; he will therefore only add, that tenderneſs in criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm is the next virtue to generoſity; and that he ſhall ſcarcely feel a greater ſhare of gratitude for thoſe, who kindly diſcover any little merit in the following Eſſays; than for thoſe who benevolently overlook their numerous imperfections.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is ſcarcely a little Eſſayiſt now-a-days, who amuſes the world under any particular title, but gives himſelf airs of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and claims ſome degree of affinity with the TATLER and SPECTATOR: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, where the itch of reading is nearly equal to the <hi>cacoethes ſcribendi,</hi> a man has no great occaſion to be poſſeſſed of either much genius or education to become a literary legiſlator, and ſet himſelf up as a regulator of the public; the moſt material article of all is, the choice of a tolerable title to attract the attention of the reader, and if this can be happily ſtruck out, learning and abilities are not ſo much as ſecondary conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0136400201:15"/>IN modern literature, a motto is a matter of no little conſequence, and an author, in the preſent anno domini, can no more pretend to circulate his writings without a motto, than without the aſſiſtance of the daily and evening papers: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an induſtrious pedlar, in the ſmall wares of letters, has got off an edition of his pamphlet without any other recommendation than the name and the motto, and alarmed the world with a very terrible title page, when the contents were as innocent as water gruel, and inſipid as a cold veal without either lemon or ſalt.</p>
               <p>IN this univerſal purſuit after titles, I do not eſteem myſelf very unhapy in the choice of the BABLER; it is a character under which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind are more or leſs diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which is indiſcriminately applicable to all orders and ſituations; different people only differ in the manner, but they are always ſure of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in eſſentials; and the humble mechanic, who harangues for the good of his country ever a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pint of porter, is in fact no more a <hi>Babler</hi> than a perſonage of diſtinguiſhed rank, who talks about the national importance with all the uſual eaſe and inſipidity of diſtinction and importance. — In reality, the great buſineſs of mankind is <hi>babling</hi>; for, if we place the principal happineſs of ſociety in converſation, a very little regard to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany we may happen to ſit with, will convince us that the generality of our acquaintance are nothing more than <hi>Bablers</hi>; ſo very limited is the number
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0136400201:16"/>
which diſcourſes now-a-days with any inclination to improve or entertain, that, I dare ſay, my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will be ſurprized when I ſet down ſome of the moſt eminent names in the kingdom among the order of <hi>Bablers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE word <hi>Babler</hi> being principally confined to verbal indiſcretion and impertinence, I ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the remaining part of this Eſſay in giving my readers ſuch particular deſcription of the <hi>Babler,</hi> that they can never be at a loſs in the application of the term when they meet with any of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p>WHENEVER a perſon ſeems extremely earneſt to engroſs the converſation of the company, there can be no manner of doubt that he is a <hi>Babler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHENEVER a perſon is uncommonly liberal in the payment of unneceſſary compliments, the moſt extenſive degree of good-nature cannot avoid ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him down a <hi>Babler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHENEVER a man is fond of remembering te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and unentertaining ſtories, and is apt to be put in mind of ſuch and ſuch a particular anecdote, by ſome correſponding circumſtance which may caſually ariſe in converſation, that man is, by every manner of means, a <hi>Babler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHENEVER we ſee a man making an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary parade of his education, and interlarding his diſcourſe with technical terms, or ſentences not clearly underſtood, in the language of Dogberry, "ſet him down a — <hi>Babler."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0136400201:17"/>WHENEVER we find a man fond of repeating his own jokes, and deſirous of telling the <hi>good thing</hi> he ſaid to his friend Jack ſuch a-one, at ſuch a time — down with him — a <hi>Babler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHENEVER we ſee any perſon ready to circulate the laugh at the expence of decency and good manners, there is no occaſion to heſitate in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing him a <hi>Babler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHENEVER we meet with a man diſpoſed to contradict, for no other reaſon but to ſhew the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of his own abilities — O! a <hi>Babler,</hi> a <hi>Babler.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>WHEN we hear him diſpute upon a ſubject he is totally unacquainted with, who can deny but he is a moſt conſummate <hi>Babler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAVING thus given the out-lines of a <hi>Babler,</hi> any perſon with a very indifferent pencil may work up a ſtriking likeneſs of the greateſt number of his acquaintance: for my own part, like the reſt of my brethren, I ſhall ſpeak of men and things as I find myſelf prompted by humour or inclination; the only reſtriction I ſhall lay myſelf under, is ever to have decency and candour in view, and never entirely to loſe ſight of my little judgment and underſtanding.—Upon theſe principles I hope to entertain the public; and, ſhould I fail in the attempt, I muſt condole myſelf with a line of my friend Horace,</p>

               <p>IN the variety of courſes which the generality of mankind purſue for the attainment of happineſs, it is not a little ſurpriſing, that they ſhould be ſhamefully inattentive in one of the moſt material points that can poſſibly inſure it. — The point I mean is, that union of the ſexes, which, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded, is the foundation of felicity to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, and of ſecurity to the public. — Nature has given every parent a power of directing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of their children, but allows of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable authority to force them; and ſuch as have a ſenſible concern for the happineſs of their offspring, ſhould be particularly careful that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal paſſion ſubſiſted between the parties before they conſented to an inviolable union. — The ill-directed tenderneſs of parental affection, has often been productive of the moſt unhappy conſequences: and many a father has made his children miſerable for life, by a miſtaken ſolicitude for their welfare, and by making a proviſion for their happineſs which was not in the leaſt eſſential, and for which they had not, in all probability, any manner of occaſion. — I am led naturally to this ſubject by a paper now lying before me, the contents of which are here preſented to the reader:</p>

                     <l>But O! — Can he fly from his mind?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>I AM the moſt miſerable of men; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it might be more prudent to conceal the cauſe of my affliction, I find an inclination to diſcloſe it in this public manner, too ſtrongly to be reſiſted. — I am a young fellow of five and twenty, Sir, neither deformed in my perſon, nor, I hope, unhappy in my temper; my fortune is eaſy, my education liberal, and, I ſuppoſe, I am as well calculated to paſs in a croud as the generality of my acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT twelve months ago, Sir, I fell paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in love with a young lady, whoſe beauty and merit entitled her to a rank much more exalted than what I could raiſe her to, though ſhe was much my inferior in point of fortune. — She was at that time courted by a young gentleman in the law, and matters had actually gone ſo far, that a day was appointed for the ſolemnization of the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials. — All this I was very well informed of, yet impetuouſly hurried by the violence of my paſsion, I diſcloſed it to the father. — He was a man of the world; — my circumſtances were much better than his intended ſon-in-law's, and he paid a leſs attention to the happineſs, than he ſhewed for the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0136400201:20"/>
advancement of his daughter. — Why ſhould I take up your time, Mr. BABLER? Maria's match with her former lover was immediately broke off, and the unhappy young lady, who never preſumed to diſobey her father's commands, was torn from the man of her heart, and married to one ſhe could never love.</p>
                  <p>I WAS in hope, Mr. BABLER, that a little time, and a tender behaviour on my ſide, as a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved more fondly than myſelf, would have utterly eraſed Mr. Bridgegrove from the boſom of my wife, and placed me in his ſtead. — But had I not been beſotted with my love, I might have eaſily known, that a laudable impreſſion upon the mind of a ſenſible woman is never to be eradicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: — No, Mr. BABLER, it is utterly impoſſible. — When a young raw girl, indeed, entertains ſomething like a regard for a man, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon of her eſteem, it is nothing but a ſtruggle of deſire, or, more properly ſpeaking, the wheyineſs of inclination, which, in a little time, ſhe laughs at herſelf, and, as ſhe grows in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, eaſily ſkims off. — But, where a woman of ſenſe has placed her affections on a man of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the paſſion is never to be eraſed; the more ſhe ponders on his worth, the more reaſon ſhe has to love him, and ſhe can never ceaſe to think of his perfections, till ſhe is wholly diveſted of thought.</p>
                  <p>UNHAPPILY for me, Mr. BABLER, this was the caſe. Mr. Bridgegrove poſſeſſed the whole heart of Maria, and, in reality, deſerved it: he is,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0136400201:21"/>
perhaps, the moſt amiable of men, and, poor fellow, loves her to diſtraction. I have been now married, Mr. BABLER, ten months, and have, I flatter myſelf, expreſſed every act of tenderneſs proper for the lover or the huſband, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. My wife behaves with the utmoſt complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, is uncommonly ſolicitous to pleaſe, but this conduct is the effect of her good ſenſe, and not the conſequence of her love. The little endearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſes between huſband and wife, are <hi>ſuffered,</hi> not <hi>enjoyed</hi>; if I complain of her coldneſs, ſhe aſſumes an air more gay, and affects to be pleaſed, though I ſee the ſtarting tear juſt burſting from her eye, and know the grief that rankles at her heart. Nay, the more I careſs the more miſerable ſhe is made; and I ſee her generouſly lamenting that ſhe cannot place her heart upon the man that poſſeſſes her hand, and is not utterly unworthy of her eſteem. O! Mr. BABLER, he muſt have no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, no feeling, that can bear a circumſtance like this unmoved. How am I frequently torn to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with reflection, even when I have her faſtened to my boſom, to think her whole ſoul is at that very moment running on another man. In her ſleep ſhe frequently throws one of her fine arms round my neck, and pronounces the name of Bridgegrove in a manner that diſtracts me. Our little boy (for ſhe is lately brought to-bed) inſtead of a bleſſing is another ſource of anxiety to us both. I over-heard her yeſterday morning, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the child, and crying, "My ſweet boy,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0136400201:22"/>
poor Bridgegrove ſhould have been your father." O! Mr. BABLER, can any ſituation be ſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as mine: — I have made the moſt amiable of women for ever wretched, and torn a worthy young fellow from the miſtreſs of his heart. I have brought all my ſorrows on myſelf, with the diſtreſsful conſideration of having no right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. I deſerve, to be miſerable. The man who would meanly hope to be happy in marriage, by ſacrificing the inclination of the woman he loves, and ungenerouſly loſes every regard to her wiſhes, while he endeavours to gratify his own, has no pretenſion to felicity. Had I never obtained the poſſeſſion of Maria, I ſhould not have been half ſo wretched as I am now: time, and another object would, perhaps, have enabled me to bear her loſs: — but now, maſter of her perſon, to find another in poſſeſſion of her heart, and to know that there is one whom ſhe holds conſiderably dearer than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are conſiderations abſolutely inſupportable. I cannot dwell any longer on the ſubject: I ſhall therefore conclude with an advice to my own ſex, never to marry a woman whoſe heart they know is engaged, nor to take a pitiful advantage of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's authority, in oppoſition to her inclination. If ſhe be a good woman, ſhe can never forget her firſt choice, and it ſhe be bad, will inevitably bring ſhame and ſcandal on the ſecond.</p>

               <p>WHEN I firſt commenced Periodical Eſſayiſt, my fears preſented a thouſand difficulties to my imagination, in the proceſs of my deſign. — I dreamed of inceſſant application to pen and ink, and of continual viſits from thoſe very worthy gentlemen, who are honoured with the appellation of <hi>Devils to the Preſs</hi>: but my apprehenſions were entirely groundleſs. — I no ſooner appeared in print than a whole army of good-natured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inſtantly drew up in my favour, amongſt the reſt the wife of a city man of faſhion, who writes to me after the following manner:</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM a haberdaſher's wife, not very far from Cornhill, and though I never received any other education than what the Engliſh language could afford me, or made a greater progreſs in my ſtudies than the Rule of Three Direct; yet I can ſpell tolerably enough, and, though I ſay it, <hi>know a ſheep's head from a carrot</hi> as well as Hodge in the new opera. — But, Sir, to the buſineſs of my letter.</p>
                  <p>My huſband and I, Sir, are a young couple juſt ſet up in buſineſs, and, you know Mr. BABLER, as ſuch, ought to be extremely complaiſant and reſpct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our cuſtomers. — In the way of trade, every
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0136400201:24"/>
body who lays out a penny with us is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as our ſuperiors, at leaſt while they ſtay in our ſhop:—but my huſband, who, it ſeems, is wiſer than I am, is quite of a contrary opinion. — He never keeps his hat off a moment in the houſe — and behaves to every one as if he rather laid them under an obligation by the ſale of his own commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. — If a lady ſteps in to buy a piece of ribband, or a hat, inſtead of ſhewing her a variety of things, that may fix her attention, or induce her to make an additional purchaſe, he talks to her about plays, and about operas: inſtead of ſaying, "Theſe, Madam, are the beſt pair of gloves in the kingdom," he cries out, "To be ſure Mr. Garrick is the greateſt actor in the world;" or, "To be ſure Miſs Brent is the fineſt ſinger in the univerſe." — There is no bearing of him, Mr. BABLER: — the fellow will prate a whole hour about Shakeſpear, when he ought to be number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his threads; and run himſelf out of breath in encomiums on Otway, when he ought to be buſy in the praiſe of his handkerchiefs.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe are trifles, Mr. BABLER, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſome other inſtances of his behaviour: — why, Sir, he would not riſe from dinner to ſerve the Lady Mayoreſs. — At dinner time, if he is told any perſon wants him about buſineſs. — "D—n it, do they think he'll get up from his dinner? Can they find no other time to come but when he is juſt ſat down at table? Let them wait or call again, which ever they think proper." —
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0136400201:25"/>
Ah, Mr. BABLER, people that are in trade ſhould get up from breakfaſt, dinner, and ſupper, to attend the neceſſary duties of their profeſſion. — Thoſe, who have no other dependence, ſhould think themſelves happy in being called to their buſineſs at dinner time, ſince it is by that means they are enabled to have any dinner at all. — No later than Wedneſday laſt, Sir, this attention to his ſtomach loſt him a country order for a hundred pounds; and even the deputy of our ward was kept waiting yeſterday above ten minutes in the ſhop, though he came to diſcharge a little account which was due for his wiſe and two daughters.</p>
                  <p>AS I am reſolved, now I have begun, Mr. BABLER, to let you know all his faults, I muſt inform you he has lately bought a horſe, and paid thirty guineas for this hopeful bargain: — this horſe he is to ride out every Sunday if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be fine, and he happens to have no engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. —'Tis odds, Mr. BABLER, that he does not find a ride convenient once a month — or that ſomething does not prevent his excurſion even at the end of that period: — but, however, let us ſuppoſe that the weather and accidental engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will permit him to go out one Sunday in four, the ſtabling and provinder for his horſe will at leaſt amount to ſeven ſhillings a week: — ſo, that every time he takes a ride out, horſe hire will coſt him eight and twenty ſhillings, (not to ſay any thing of the original purchaſe;) and for half the money be might get a hackney coach for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0136400201:26"/>
whole day, to carry all his family. — And here I cannot help reflecting, Mr. BABLER, upon this injudicious practice of riding out even Sunday, which ſeems ſo much in faſhion among the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our polite citizens. — If a tradeſman buys a horſe, and does not ride out every Sunday, his purchaſe becomes uſeleſs, and his money thrown away: — if he does, he debars himſelf of every other enjoyment, and cuts himſelf off from the only opportunity he has of attending the public worſhip of God. — He is loſt to his family and friends one day in ſeven, and is an alien to his Creator, on the moſt ſacred of them all.</p>
                  <p>PRAY, Mr. BABLER, print this letter: — your writings are much read in our neighbourhood, and my huſband himſelf condeſcends to ſay you are a very ſenſible ſort of a fellow. — If you ſhould have any opportunity, I beg you would ſpeak ſomething about the dreſs of tradeſmen, for I have ſome reaſon to think my huſband has actually be ſpoke a laced hat, and given the taylor directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to put vellum holes in his next ſuit of cloaths. — Do oblige me, dear Mr. BABLER, and I ſhall always acknowledge myſelf much.</p>

               <p>OF all the enemies to ſociety, there is none which ſhould be held in a greater abhorrence than a man of gallantry profeſſed; and yet, in this faſhionable age, it is a character which the generality of our young fellows, and but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our old ones, are uncommonly ſolicitous to obtain. But the ſtrongeſt invectives againſt this infamous diſpoſition, may not, perhaps, be half ſo ſerviceable as a little ſtory, which a very worthy gentleman of my acquaintance, favoured me with laſt night, for which reaſon I ſhall lay aſide declaration and proceed to my narrative.</p>
               <p>NOT many weeks ago, at the firſt reduction of our forces, among many other officers who were diſmiſſed, a young lieutenant, one Mr. Franſham, received his diſcharge. As the income of this gentleman's commiſſion, during his continuance in the army, could not ſuffer him to lay by any migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters for an emergency, his half pay would have been but a ſlender ſubſiſtence, had not an old ſchool-fellow of his, one Mr. Harold, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gentleman, made him a cordial offer of his houſe and table, till he ſhould be fortunately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in ſome reputable employ. Mr. Harold was the moſt amiable of men; he had a handſome perſon, a fine underſtanding, an affluent fortune, and a benevolent heart: He had been but newly married to a young lady, of whom he was paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0136400201:28"/>
fond; and who, if wit and beauty were capable of conſtituting matrimonial felicity, could not fail of making him the moſt happy of men.</p>
               <p>MR. Franſham was one of thoſe people who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a Covent-Garden ſort of knowledge, and, like a maggot in a cheeſe, knew no part of the world but the rotten: His converſation was lively, but not improving, and he carried the appearance of much underſtanding, though, in reality, he had but little ſenſe: his company, however, was entertaining enough: he talked of the polite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions; told a ſtory tolerably well; and ſung with ſome voice, and much taſte. As the flaſhineſs of his converſation carried the appearance of wit, Mrs. Harold was not a little pleaſed with her new viſitant; and Mr. Franſham, from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he came into the houſe, had formed a deſign of rendering himſelf as agreeable as poſſible to her, and without either being confined by the rules of friendſhip, or the principles of gratitude, he thought he could not be in reality a fine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, without endeavouring to alienate her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from her huſband. — To dwell upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances is unneceſſary; he left no art uneſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gain his point, and, in an evil hour, too fatally ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>POOR Mr. Harold, not in the leaſt ſuſpecting the nature of their intimacy, was really pleaſed at the countenance ſhewn to Mr. Franſham, by his wife: every mark of complacency ſhewn to that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he looked upon as a particular inſtance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0136400201:29"/>
of her affection for himſelf; — but one evening returning from a viſit, which he had paid alone to a gentleman in his neighbourhood, conſiderably ſooner than he was expected, upon going up to Mrs. Harold's chamber, he found the door locked, and fancied he heard her voice, and Mr. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham's, in a very familiar ſort of converſation. An inſtinctive kind of terror ſtruck inſtantly to his heart: — He knocked at the door, which not being immediately unlocked, he burſt it open, and juſt as he entered, ſaw his perfidious friend eſcape out of the window into the garden. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic at this ſight, the violence of his paſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from purſuing the infamous villain, by whom he had been ſo barbarouſly wronged: He gazed in a violent ſit of horror for ſome time upon his wife, who ſat trembling on the bed-ſide; then running to a caſe of piſtols, which were kept generally in the bed-chamber, he ſnapt one of them at Mrs. Harold, and ran immediately after to find the partner of her crime; but Mr. Franſham, knowing Mr. Harold's temper too well to ſtay within his reach, made ſuch good uſe of his time, that he was quite out of danger before the other began the purſuit.</p>
               <p>HAPPILY for Mrs. Harold, the piſtol was not charged which was directed at her, though the fright threw her into a ſwoon: — but recovering, and finding herſelf entirely ſafe, ſhe thought it moſt prudent to retire to a friend's houſe for a little time, till a reconciliation could be effected
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0136400201:30"/>
with her huſband: Here ſhe remained for about a month, and tried every means of obtaining his forgivneſs, but to no purpoſe; and the following letter, which he wrote to her in his cooler mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, put a total ſtop to any future attempts of that nature.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>BY what name ſhall I diſtinguiſh you?—or how ſhall I be able to write to a woman with any degree of temper, whom I am born ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly to curſe and deteſt.—Can you, Maria; be mean enough to think of living with a man whom you have covered with diſgrace, or bear the eternal memento which his preſence muſt give you of your own,—that I did love,—but wherefore do I dwell upon a circumſtance which I muſt endeavour to obliterate for ever, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſincerity of my paſſion, when I think upon the reward it has met.</p>
                     <p>IF I expect to be forgiven myſelf in the next world, Maria, you conjure me to pardon your offences in this.—What a wretch muſt the man be who excuſes a crime which the eye of all acquitting mercy cannot look upon without horror.—If there are particular crimes, which we are taught to believe heaven itſelf will not pardon, can we ſuppoſe that there are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which it is impoſſible for human nature ever to over-look?—Forgive you, Maria!—oh that I could.—My anguiſh would not be of that poignant nature which it is, could the baſeneſs of your conduct ever be forgot.—See me!—no.

               <p>THE ſequel of the ſtory is,—Mrs. Harold, through ſhame and remorſe, is pining at the houſe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the country, and ſuppoſed to be in a very declining ſituation.—As for Franſham, he eſcaped over into France; but falling into a number of exceſſes, reduced himſelf to the neceſſity of the road; but being apprehended in his firſt robbery, will in all probability, if he eſcapes death, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined during life to the gallies. Mr. Harold is grown more compoſed, and all his friends are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in keeping up his ſpirits, and with ſuch ſucceſs,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0136400201:32"/>
that it is hoped in a little time his tranquility will be reſtored, eſpecially as they all carefully avoid mentioning a ſingle ſyllable of Mrs. Harold.— We may conclude our little narrative with a few lines from Rowe's Fair Penitent.</p>

               <p>IT was a common expreſſion of the late Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke's, that if he was but an hour in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a ſtranger, and heard him ſpeak but fifty words, he could tell the particular turn or bias of his temper. — When I conſider the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſry of mankind to enhance the idea of their own characters, and reflect that there is a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſomething in the opinion of every man which gives him an advantage over the reſt of the world, I am inclined to belive that his lordſhip's declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not altogether ſo extraordinary as a perſon at firſt might poſſibly imagine it.</p>
               <p>IN people of underſtanding the particular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon which they principally value themſelves, is rather eaſier to be diſcovered than in thoſe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0136400201:33"/>
ordinary capacities, becauſe converſation taking a more liberal turn, furniſhes a greater number of opportunities to draw it out. I was laſt night ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with two or three friends, who are not a little eſteemed in the literary world, when I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reflected upon lord Bolingbroke's obſervation.</p>
               <p>—One of them opened the diſcourſe with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to the abilities of Mr. Pope, and ſeemed intent to make that celebrated author the ſubject of converſation. Poetry he talked of as the firſt of all the ſciences, and conſequently hinted, that ſuch as excelled in this were ſuperior to the moſt eminent profeſſors of any other. It is almoſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to tell, that my friend has himſelf publiſhed ſome pieces in this way of writing, which are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admired; and that while he was expatiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the merit of Mr. Pope, he had a ſecret intention of reminding us of his own character. — This gentleman, though a very ſenſible man, carries his zeal for the poetical muſe a little too far: he looks upon every one with an eye of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference who has not received ſome marks of that lady's favour, and very lately refuſed a woman of ten thouſand pounds who was paſſionately in love with him, for no other reaſon in life, than becauſe ſhe left the room, about ſome domeſtic occurrence, while he was reading an imitation of one of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>race's odes, which he had written, it ſeems, that morning.</p>
               <p>MY poetical friend entertained us for ſome time, when a mathematical acquaintance turned
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0136400201:34"/>
the diſcourſe upon Sir Iſaac Newton; in a little time my good friend Dr. Nettletop beat Sir Iſaac out of the field with Boerhaave; Mr. Longwind, the hiſtorian, however, quickly conquer'd Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave with Rapin; and the wide field of hiſtory itſelf was not long after covered by Mr. Choleric, the politician, with the triumphs of his immortal King of Pruſſia.</p>
               <p>BUT if ſo great a fondneſs of ſhewing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular qualification wherein we excel, though it be a meritorious one, is deſerving of our cenſure, how much more to be condemned are thoſe ſort of people, who build their reputation upon trifles of the moſt ridiculous nature, and are conſtantly taking up the time of every company they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into with recitals of no conſequence to themſelves, and no entertainment to any body elſe. My couſin <hi>Jack Babler</hi> gives me great offence this way: Jack particularly piques himſelf upon a very ſmall ſtomach, and an unconquerable aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a buttock of beef. Hence, wherever he goes we are always ſure of a diſſertation upon eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the ſmallneſs of his appetite is a never-failing ſource of converſation; and I have known him to take up two hours and a half to convince a large company that he has not eat a pound of meat in a fortnight. If by a revolution in his habit of body my poor couſin ſhould unfortunately get a good ſtomach, he muſt reſign all pretenſion to merit, and baniſh himſelf from ſociety for the want of common converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0136400201:35"/>BUT the moſt extraordinary character I ever know that was not abſolutely vicious, is my friend Sir Harry Whimſey's:—Sir Harry has underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet he only uſes it to be a fool; he has a fortune capable of providing all the pleaſures of life, and yet he is never happy till he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely miſerable.—Sir Harry, if he happens to be indiſpoſed, is a little eaſy in his mind, but if he be really ill, 'tis then he experiences the higheſt ſatisfaction; his friends are all ſummoned, and with an air of the utmoſt conſequence, told of his melancholy ſituation; how the pain in his head has torn him to pieces, and how he has not had a wink of ſleep for three nights. When he finds any concern expreſſed for his condition, his pride begins to ſwell, and the notion of his own import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance encreaſes in proportion to the pity of his friends and the danger of his diſorder.—He has been a man of very little merit however theſe three years, for, being naturally of a good conſtitution, and not much addicted to intemperance of any nature, he has unhappily eſcaped the ſmalleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>THE knowledge of theſe foibles in other people is of no advantage to us, unleſs they teach us to correct whatever may be amiſs of the ſame nature in ourſelves; the beſt of us have our little abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; for which reaſon when we laugh at the peculiarities of our acquaintance, we ſhould by no means neglect an examination into our own.</p>

               <p>AT a time when the whole Kingdom is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mad with political diſquiſitions, it would be ſomething hard if the BABLER was not allowed to dwell upon the ſubject; but as he is very unlike the generality of his name-ſakes, and dreads no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as offending, he declares himſelf publicly a lover of truth, yet an advocate of no party, and ſets up for the title of a good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman without being either a Whig or a Tory. Party diſtinctions are to him, the moſt diſguſting circumſtances imaginable, and an intemperate zeal in the ſupport of any faction, not only the moſt ridiculous commotion in ſociety, but the moſt dangerous.</p>
               <p>SIR Robert Walpole, who knew human nature as well as moſt people, has been very open and very honeſt upon this ſubject. I have a letter of his this moment before me, which has never yet appeared in print, and which will, I dare ſay, be no leſs a curioſity than an inſtruction to my readers.—Sir Robert, I need not obſerve, had been for a long time the idol of the people, and was even committed to the Tower for too ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous an aſſertion of their liberties.—After his intereſt had got the better of his Patriotiſm, and that the fondneſs of fame had yielded to a paſſion for power, Sir Robert wrote the following letter

                  <p>I RECEIVED your laſt with much ſatisfaction, though it contained ſome little acrimony on my conduct, and eaſily diſcovered the greatneſs of your eſteem, notwithſtanding it was blended ſo frequently with reproof.</p>
                  <p>INDEED, my dear friend, whatever colour my change of principles may wear, or however it may be conſidered by the generality of people, I have done nothing which every other man in the world would not have done in my ſituation.—The very beſt of us are fond of greatneſs and power in our hearts; and however we may ſeem to deſpiſe either, the contempt never laſts a moment longer than the incapacity to obtain them.—The friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a King, the command of his revenues, an opportunity of promoting our friends and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over our enemies, let me tell you, are conſiderations of no very trifling nature; and the man, in my opinion, muſt be ſomething more or leſs than human, wherever they are reſiſted.—As I have not vanity ſufficient to pretend to the firſt, I have ſenſe enough to avoid the imputation of the latter; and am content with being nothing more than mortal, provided there are no malicious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make me any thing leſs.</p>
                  <p>POPULARITY, my dear friend, is nothing more than a ſtep-ladder for ambition to reach the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0136400201:40"/>
of place and preferment. We all have our prices, and if it is aſked why I continued ſo long in an oppoſition to the court, my anſwer is this, they did not come up to mine. There is ſcarcely a member, whoſe price I do not know to a ſingle ſix-pence, and whoſe very foul I could not almoſt purchaſe at the firſt offer.—The reaſon former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have been deceived in this matter is evident; they never conſidered the tempers of the people they had to deal with. I have known miniſters ſo weak as to offer an avaritious raſcal a ſtar and garter; and to think of bribing a profuſe young rogue, who ſet no value upon money, with a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative employment.—I purſue methods as oppoſite as the poles, and conſequently my adminiſtration muſt be attended with very different effects.</p>
                  <p>THE people of England are, in general, a ſet of hot-headed fools, a parcel of ſenſible coxcombs, who, though perfectly able to examine the bottom of things, never judge farther than the ſurface.— They know their rights and privileges inviolably ſafe, and yet they are never eaſy unleſs they think them in danger.—It is no way difficult therefore, for an aſpiring commoner to take an advantage of this diſpoſition, and to convert their ignorant ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude for the public emolument, entirely to the promotion of his own.—A ſtaunch oppoſition on two or three queſtions, right or wrong, to the court, gets him a name; half a dozen impudent unmeaning ſpeeches, the admiration; and a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable pamphlet, the very ſouls of the people.—
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0136400201:41"/>
Patriotic barbers toaſt him in ale-houſes, public-ſpirited ſhoemakers harangue for him in the ſtreets, and free-born chairmen and houſe-breakers, ſing forth his praiſes in every night-cellar within the bills of mortality.—To quiet the minds of the mob, he gets a place. His own intereſt then obliges him to join the meaſures of the court. Upon this, the golden idol turns inſtantly to a calf, and leaves the field of preferment to ſomebody elſe, who is next to ſhare the admiration, and, in due time, the curſes of the vulgar.—I remember I never thought my point completely carried, till they clapped me in the Tower.—I looked upon myſelf then as a made man, and the event fully juſtified the warmth of my expectations. In reality I know no better friends to the conſtitution of this country, was it any way in danger, than this ſet of imaginary patriots:—they ſtruggle very heartily while they are at it, and the moment they are bought off, their preferment inſpires others with a view of following their example, in order by the ſame means to attain the ſame ends; and thus we always find a ſucceſſion of zealous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, who conſtantly advance the good of their country by being ſo very ſtrenuous about their own. But to drop this ſubject, know, my dear friend, that the conſtitution of this country is ſo critically founded, that whatever effects the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the people, will, in a little time, endanger the prerogative of the crown: there is no ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate intereſt for either to conſult; and in ſuch a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0136400201:42"/>
caſe, no man of ſenſe will dream that the court can have the leaſt notion of encroaching on the liberties of the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>You ſee, my dear friend, how freely I deal with myſelf; but, with me, patriotiſm goes for nothing. There is not this moment one patriot in the houſe, nor, indeed, is there the leaſt neceſſity that there ſhould.—Do not deprive me of your good opinion for my candour, but go on to eſteem me, and be aſſured I ſhall ever remain,</p>

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0136400201:43"/>You muſt know, Mr. Babler, that I am a plain pains taking man, and neither more or leſs than a buckle-maker, near Cornhill: I have kept ſhop theſe twenty years, and brought up my family, conſiſting of a wife, one ſon, and a daughter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently enough, though I ſay it myſelf; and, may be, have ſaved a trifle or ſo in my buſineſs; but that does not ſignify.</p>
                  <p>As every thing I have has been made by a cloſe application to trade, I do not chuſe appearing grander, Mr. Babler, than what becomes a perſon of my ſtation; ſo that I confine myſelf to a ſuit or two of modeſt cloaths, and never put on my largeſt wig or my beſt ruffled ſhirt, but of a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.—My wife, however, who had been formerly a lady's maid in the city, has higher notions, and as I do not chuſe to quarrel with her, indulges herſelf in the gratification of them to as ridiculous a degree as my circumſtances can allow.—She would not come into the ſhop for the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſack or a French night cap, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo loaded with powder and pomatum, that the very ſmell is enough to take away the breath of my cuſtomers. I am never ſuffered to walk with her of a <hi>working</hi> day, becauſe I am not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently fine; nay, I am to eſteem it as no trifling favour, if I am permitted to accompany her to the White Conduit Houſe or Iſlington fields of a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. You may be ſure, Mr. Babler, that ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an example has not eſcaped my children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imitation. My daughter, who is about nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0136400201:44"/>
will put up with no leſs an appellation than <hi>a young lady,</hi> and my ſon of courſe thinks himſelf equally juſtified in ſupporting the title of <hi>a young gentleman</hi>; he quarrelled with my eldeſt apprentice the other morning for calling him by the familiar name of <hi>Andrew,</hi> and my daughter inſiſted upon turning away our laſt maid, becauſe, in ſpeaking of her to a third perſon, ſhe did not ſay <hi>Miſs Dolly.</hi> My wife's fooliſh indulgence is a ſtill greater means of ſpoiling them.—My daughter is always dreſſed out in a manner that renders her above do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any neceſſary article in the oeconomy of a houſe, and ſuperior to the condeſcenſion of ſerving in the ſhop.—If a cuſtomer comes in, inſtead of aſking what he wants, ſhe orders the boy to call <hi>his maſter,</hi> for ſhe woud not ſtoop to ſend for <hi>her father</hi> to haggle about a twelve-penny knife, or a two-ſhilling pair of buckles.—If ſhe ſits behind the counter, it is with a look of dignity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and, to every new comer in, puts on a new air, in order to enhance the idea of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: my wife has lately bought her a pair, of ſtone ſhoe-buckles; and I am hourly teazed to death about purchaſing her a metal watch. My ſon, Mr. Babler, is not a whit leſs affected than my daughter. I cannot ſee in what reſpect he is any way my ſuperior; and yet, through his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's means, he appears in a manner I never durſt aſſume without being laughed at by all my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. He has his ruffled ſhirt on every day, his clean white ſtockings; has actually got a ſilk
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0136400201:45"/>
waiſtcoat with vellum button-holes, and a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced hat for Sundays. Is there any bearing this, Mr. Babler! But this is not the worſt of it: As he improves in dreſs, the more he decreaſes in his manners; and the better he is ſupplied with the articles of finery, the leſs reſpectful he grows to thoſe who provide him with the means. Lord, Sir! he conſiders me in no better light than a ſort of an upper ſervant, who is obliged to conſult the gratification of his pleaſures, and to humour every turn and whim of his inclination. He ſcarce ever takes his hat off before me, and is ſo far from thinking that there is any thing out of character in his dreſs, that he is always exclaiming againſt the poverty of mine. In this he is ſupported both by his mother and his ſiſter, the former always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, I ſhame them with my naſty way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and my dutiful daughter wondering how her Papa can dreſs in ſo ſhabby and pitiful a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—We are talked of all over the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Mr. Babler, and I am for ever rated at the Blue Poſts for ſubmitting to my wife's dominion in my family.—Print this, pray do, ſhame may produce better effects than reaſon, and if it but makes my wife concerned at her behaviour, I ſhall poſſibly have every right to call myſelf,</p>

               <p>I DO not know any thing in the preſent age which has done ſuch eſſential diſſervice to the cauſe of virtue and morality as the ridiculous affectation of wit, which prevails in almoſt every order of the people. Under a pretenſion to this quality, the moſt blameable levities become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admired; and, what is much worſe, the moſt dangerous of all our vices are ſet up as a ſtandard for public imitation, to deſtroy the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of a deſerving friend by ſome occaſional ſtroke of impertinence, is, now-a-days, ſufficient foundation for the character of a wit, and we frequently reckon that perſon as poſſeſſed of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary abilities, who bids defiance to the mandates of his God.</p>
               <p>THERE is one great unhappineſs attending this propenſity to faſhionable wit, which is, that men of the beſt ſenſe very often think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give in to the general opinion of their acquaintance; and, in order to merit the eſteem of the world, ſubmit to the very errors which their own underſtanding muſt naturally lead them to condemn.—Among the number of my own friends who are unhappily, victims to the world in this reſpect, I cannot, without the utmoſt concern, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon poor <hi>Ned Froilby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Ned</hi> came from the Univerſity, which was at the age of nineteen, he had a doating old
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0136400201:52"/>
grand-mother, who ſupplied him plentifully with money, and by whoſe fondneſs he was enabled to indulge all the luxurious depravities incident to his years: Upon his firſt coming to town he was introduced, as a hopeful young fellow at a ſociety of wits, who frequented a faſhionable coffee-houſe in the neighbourhood of Covent garden. Unacquainted with the world, their manners were perfectly new to our young adventurer, and it was not without an infinite pain he heard obſcenity and execration form the principle part of the firſt night's diſcourſe. Notwithſtanding this, there was a ſomething in the company which produced an involuntary attachment, and he was overheard whiſpering to the friend who introduced him, <q>that it was a pity ſuch and ſuch gentlemen were not leſs immoral, for he looked upon them as exceſſively agreeable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is, in the human mind, a natural promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of imitating manners wherever we happen to like a man. This was poor <hi>Ned</hi>'s caſe; in leſs than a week an oath was not altogether ſo ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it was rather too reſerved for a young fellow to baniſh an innocent freedom in talking of women that ſuited with his years and conſtitution. There is no neceſſity for circumſtantial particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities; ſuffice it, that <hi>Ned,</hi> before the month was over, grew paſſionately fond of the character of a <hi>wit,</hi> and ſhewed, that in purchaſing ſo honourable an appellation, he was utterly regardleſs of the means.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0136400201:53"/>THE firſt ſtroke of wit that procured him any reputation, was the overturning of his Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's coach, in a little excurſion to Richmond, where he inſiſted on mounting the coach-box, and commencing driver: Our Phaeton, unable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the horſes, drove againſt a mile-ſtone, upon which the carriage inſtantly gave a violent jerk, and pitched him headlong into a cucumber bed on the road ſide, where he was miſerably cut with the glaſſes: the good old lady had her arm broke by the accident, and what with the acuteneſs of the pain, and her terrors for her <hi>Neddy,</hi> a fever enſued, which carried her off in a fortnight. When he was able to come abroad, his next ſally of wit was upon an unfortunate waiter, whoſe eye he knocked out with the head of a tobacco-pipe; this coſt him two hundred pounds to ſuppreſs a proſecution, excluſive of a twenty pound annuity during the life of the ſufferer.—A duel with a Highland officer for ſome reflexions on brimſtone was his next exploit; after which he ſucceſſively bred four riots at the playhouſe, and carried off ſeven milliners apprentices within the purlieus of Covent Garden. It is remarkable, that when our modern men of wit endeavour at a character, they generally employ themſelves in proving their ſpirit, and the moment they arrive at the pitch of <hi>doing</hi> what they think proper, the itch of heroiſm naturally diſappears, and they content themſelves with <hi>ſaying</hi> what they pleaſe.—This is exactly <hi>Ned</hi>'s caſe; finding the reputation of his courage
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0136400201:54"/>
ſufficiently eſtabliſhed, he reſts ſatisfied with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing every converſation he over hears, and has humility enough to be no more than very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent whenever he engages in an argument. At the playhouſe I have heard him affect a horſe laugh in the moſt diſtreſſing paſſage of a tragedy; and at a concert I never knew him pleaſed with the performers till he had put them entirely out. Fatigued with this inſipid round, his wit has taken a different turn; religion and it's members are now the objects of his ridicule, and poſſibly from ſome paſſages in his life, having reaſon to fear that there is another world after this, he always endeavours to convince his acquaintance that there is not.— Unhappy <hi>Ned Frailby,</hi> ſetting out a faſhionable wit, he has ſunk into a real infidel, and, to gain the admiration of a blockhead he ſhould deſpiſe, has forfeited the favour of his God. The people who wiſh him beſt can only pity him; but where he is not perſonally known, he is looked upon as what he is; yet <hi>Ned</hi> has a thouſand good qualities; his ear is never turned from the complaint of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor his bounty with-held from the tear of diſtreſs: he is the beſt of maſters, the kindeſt of landlords, and the warmeſt of friends. He has a fine fancy, a ſound underſtanding, and a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent heart; but a paſſion for admiration has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done him, and he is an amiable reprobate at beſt.</p>
               <p>To ſuch a picture there needs no comment: let any man of wit clap his hand upon his heart, and examine if he has not all of <hi>Ned</hi>'s bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0136400201:55"/>
and then let him try how far they are exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by the good. If, upon examination, he ſhould appear to have a great deal of the firſt and very little of the latter, he is really a very wretched being, and we may very fairly cry out with the poet,</p>

                     </gap>. Our friends <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> I had a ſincere value for in their private ſtations, but in their public capacities I looked up on them both (and you know I have ſaid it to their faces) as little better than a couple of r — ls. This regard to their abſtracted merit as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, has frequently led me to ſupport tenets dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to my principles; and I have often engaged as a champion for the conduct of the miniſters, becauſe I had a cordial affection for the integrity of the men. There is ſuch an honeſt openneſs in Harley, and ſo apparent an ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in St. John, that I am attached to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in ſpite of my teeth, and left while I labour to reſcue them from the name of ſcoundrels in their offices, to ſink under the weight of the damn'd appellation myſelf.</p>
                  <p>IN fact, Pope, I believe it impoſſible for any miniſter to be an honeſt man. There are fifty thouſand trap doors, from the very nature of his office, in which it is next to impoſſible but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity muſt tumble.—One right honourable r — l or other has eternally ſome ſtrumpet to provide for, or ſome cuckold to recommend, in preference to the claims of real worth, and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0136400201:57"/>
pretenſions of the truly deſerving; not to mention any thing of a miniſter's own friends, his imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and dependants, who all naturally expect to be provided for in courſe. Thus ſituated, a man at the head of affairs is obliged very frequently to overlook the ſolicitations of ſervices and merit, as I have this moment obſerved, and expoſes himſelf to the reſentment of many diſappointed levee danglers, from an utter impoſſibility to provide for all. Hence a number of enemies are certain of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking him at every quarter, and, as the battery in ſome places may be juſtly enough levelled, the report muſt be heard without end.</p>
                  <p>BUT as wealth and power are always ſure of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advocates, we never ſee a miniſter without a number of literary mercenaries employed in his defence, to refute the arguments of malice, or to evade the accuſations of truth; to knock on the head with the hammer of plump contradiction, or to puzzle by a fallacious repreſentation of facts. Theſe worthy gentlemen, did they really conſider the true intereſt of the miniſter, would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour at any thing like a fair diſpute. A round lie ought to be given to every aſſertion prejudicial to his reputation, and this would produce ſuch a number of replies, that the public would ſoon give up the diſcuſſion of a point which ſaddled them with a heavy expence. A ſwarm of pamphlets the lower orders have not the ability to purchaſe, and the higher have not the leiſure to read: Hence a debate that occaſions a number of publications muſt

                  <p>PEOPLE may talk what they will of the infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which miniſterial artificers have made upon the liberty of the ſubject, but in my opinion the Stamp-Office is the moſt dangerous; the duty laid there upon all publications, is a flagrant attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the liberty of the preſs, and by choaking up the only channel which the public have of ſetting forth their grievances, cuts off the moſt probable mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE general plea which is uſed by miniſterial advocates, and a plea which I myſelf have uſed with ſucceſs is, that an attack upon the miniſter is an affront upon the crown; and that there is no accuſation laid at the door of a ſecretary, that is not an indirect reflexion upon the king. This is a pleaſant way of reaſoning, to be ſure; for by the expreſs declaration of our laws, an Engliſh prince is a piece of royal infallibility, incapable of doing wrong: as this poſition is univerſally admitted, it muſt conſequently follow, that let us ſpatter as we pleaſe, not a bit of dirt can ſtick upon the monarch; or even if it could, would the monarch
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0136400201:59"/>
be an honeſt or a ſenſible man, to be offended, if it was apparently evident he was in the wrong? Duty and Reverence is all ſtuff, Pope; the Prince who is offended at cenſure, ought never to furniſh a cauſe for it; and the King who would exact the obedience, ought to deſerve the affection of his people. This is the voice of reaſon, and the Prince who is above liſtening to it, may poſſibly be feared; but I'll ſtake my ſalvation that he never can be loved.</p>
                  <p>THE poſition that a King can do no wrong, Pope, muſt either tax the Engliſh nation with great injuſtice, or great inconſiſtency. If a King can do no wrong, why was King James the ſecond, baniſhed? And if a king can do wrong, why the plague are we conſtantly affirming that he <hi>cannot.</hi> Either way we ſtand ſelf condemned: in the firſt place, we muſt be very wicked men, if the poſſition holds, and very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ones in the ſecond, if it does not. But incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency is our prevailing characteriſtic; and if we are not ſet down as a nation of ſcoundrels, we muſt think ourſelves pretty eaſy under the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fools.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM going to advance a poſition which the whole world has been intimate with, ſince it's firſt creation; yet, what is not a little odd, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that one half of our modern authors think as neceſſary to diſcuſs, three or four times a week, as if we were under the greateſt doubt of it's truth, or utterly unacquainted with its rectitude. This Poſition, Sir, is neither more nor leſs than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of all human enjoyments, and the juſt diſregard which ſhould be ſhewn to every poſſeſſion of this life, by ſuch as have a proper ſolicitude for the happineſs of the next.</p>
                  <p>I AM an old fellow, maſter Babler, very near ſixty-five; and when I look back upon the various occurrences of my life, and recollect the objects, which principally attracted my attention, from the cradle to the preſent hour, I cannot help crying out with the poet,</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0136400201:61"/>
                     <l>A phantom of pleaſure, like happineſs dreſt,</l>
                     <l>From the cradle we're taught to purſue;</l>
                     <l>Yet our hope is but vanity, take it at beſt,</l>
                     <l>And our wiſdom but vanity too.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>WHEN I was about ten years of age, Sir, the <hi>Summum bonum</hi> of all worldly felicity was a holiday from ſchool, and a pennyworth of marbles.—How have I envyed a chimney-ſweeper's apprentice baſking in the ſun, in all the amplitude of idleneſs and rags, when I conſidered him as unreſtrained by the tyranny of ſome ſurly pedagogue, or enabled to cry <hi>"fair up"</hi> at a game of <hi>ſlap.</hi>—As I grew up, Sir, my attention was imperceptibly engaged to amuſements, rather more manly, but, however, leſs innocent. Many a good time have I been diverted by faſtening a rope acroſs our ſtreet in a dark night, to tumble unſuſpecting paſſengers in the dirt; and many a cat have I tied to the knocker of a ſtreet door, to throw the firſt ſervant wench into fits, by whom it might be occaſionally opened—the more miſchief on theſe pretty little frolicks, the better the amuſement; and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, never to have received ſo much real ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being the cauſe in one night of an old woman's eye ſcratched half out, and a man's break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his leg.</p>
                  <p>AT ſeventeen, however, I began to look on amuſements of this nature with an eye of diſguſt; my time was now wholly taken up with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0136400201:62"/>
upon every little girl in our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and between that age and twenty-five, I had the happineſs of ruining nineteen. You can by no means conceive the tranſports I felt, Mr. Babler, to ſurvey ſo many victims to my perſonal merit and addreſs; often has my heart exulted at the tears of ſome poor deluded innocent, my ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction being always good naturedly proportioned to the diſtreſs which I cauſed; and once I looked upon myſelf as the happieſt of all human beings, three young ladies with whom I had been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, being fortunately diſcarded on that account by their friends, and turned out of doors.</p>
                  <p>AT thirty, Sir, I was married to a woman whoſe perſon was far from being agreeable, but whoſe fortune had too many charms to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. My ambition now was directed to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of a fine ſtud of cattle, and a magnificent country houſe. My wiſhes were gratified, but in leſs than three months I ſold off the one, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom put my foot into the other, unleſs ſome very extraordinary circumſtance indeed, made my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance abſolutely neceſſary on the ſpot.</p>
                  <p>THE mutability of my pleaſures ſtill continuing Sir, I was ſucceſſively fond of the reputation of a hard drinker, the character of a deſperate rider, the ſame of a good markſman, the glory of a bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard player, and once was miſerable a whole twelve-month, on account of loſing a rubber at Dutch Pins.—I have eat a raw beef ſtake out of pride, whiſtled for a wager with a very honeſt

butcher in Newgate-market, and thought it a piece of heroiſm to be locked up all night with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of a murderer, diſſected by the ſurgeons. In ſhort, Sir, there is ſcarcely a faſhionable article of reputation that I have not acquired; but the hey day of the ſpirits being long ſince over, and reaſon beginning to reflect upon purſuits which nature is no longer able to continue, I look upon every former object of my admiration, with a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and an inſuperable contempt:—and yet, Sir, at this age I have my enjoyments, which I cannot help purſuing with an avidity truly ridiculous. I pique myſelf not a little on ſmoaking half a dozen pipes of an evening, and have lately contended for the honour of being the beſt politician at our club, in a long argument with Doctor Dozely the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, about Magna Charta, and the natural rights of a free-born Engliſhman.—Yet, Sir, is all this blaze of reputation worth living for.—I bluſh to be diverted by ſuch trifles, but can by no means throw them off.—I am, in ſhort, a convincing proof, Sir, of Solomon's ſenſible obſervation, "that all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit," being perfectly ſenſible that no happineſs or enjoyment of this life, can be at all equal to conſcious ſatisfaction, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the unutterable tranſports of the next.</p>

               <p>UNIVERSAL ſoever as the ſpirit of amour may be, and great ſoever as the countenance may be which it receives from the polite world, there is no one ſource from which ſuch a number of calamities are produced, nor any one ſpring which pours in ſuch a variety of misfortunes upon Society. Unhappily in this gay age the depravity of manners has ariſen to ſo enormous a degree, that it is in ſome meaſure neceſſary for a young fellow to give into the faſhionable follies, and practice vices to which he has a real abhorrence, if he would eſtabliſh the character of a man of taſte, or ſhew himſelf tolerably well acquainted with the world.</p>
               <p>IN the proſecution of modern amour, more than in any other vice, there are allurements which very few think themſelves capable of reſiſting, or even chuſe to reſiſt, if they could. A man finds his vanity tickled, as well as his inclination gratified, in the ſeduction of unwary innocence, and, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the tranſport reſulting from poſſeſſion itſelf, the generality of our ſex think, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of ſatisfaction, upon their own accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuppoſe they muſt be poſſeſſed of ſome extraordinary qualifications when a woman ſhews her ſenſibility of them at no leſs a price than her everlaſting diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0136400201:65"/>THE ſame vanity which impels the one ſex to a purſuit of unwarrantable amour, is the very reaſon why the other is ſo ſeldom offended, when they even know that a man's deſign is repugnant to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and virtue. The pleaſure ariſing from the adoration paid to a pretty face, caſts a veil over the infamous intention of him who offers it, and the generality of women are content to be addreſſed upon the footing of ſtrumpets, provided the offence which is offered to the purity of their hearts, is mingled with a well-turn'd compliment to the beauty of their perſons. Hence, actuated by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and perhaps rendered weak from conſtitution, the amiable ideot of the ſofter ſex is immediately undone, and the remorſeleſs libertine of ours feels no compunction in the ruin of her character, ſince the monſtrous depravity of general opinion induces him to conſider it as an enhancement of his own. Nay, this vanity on the ſide of the ladies has ſometimes been ſo unaccountably abſurb, that two ſiſters have quarrelled about the adreſſes of an agreeable ſpoiler, and contended, with an inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſedulity, for the honour of ſacrificing their peace of mind in this world, and endangering their everlaſting happineſs in the next.</p>
               <p>INDEPENDANT of the lamentable conſequences in point of character, which on the woman's part moſt commonly attend a deviation from virtue, the effects which ſuch a deviation has upon her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is generally fatal. There is a ſoftneſs in the female mind, ſo very ſuſceptible of tender impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0136400201:66"/>
that it is next to impoſſible the idea of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured lover ſhould ever be eraſed; and as it is equally impoſſible that the libertine profeſſed can confine himſelf to any ſingle attachment, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt neceſſarily be wretched when ſhe knows that thoſe vows and proteſtations are indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately paid to the whole ſex, which ſhe once vainly imagined were engroſſed by herſelf. Beſides this there is an ingrateful ſort of indolence in the temper of the man, which renders him indifferent in proportion to the ſtudy taken to pleaſe him, and a ſpaniel-like kind of fondneſs in the diſpoſition of the woman, which increaſes her tenderneſs in proportion as ſhe experiences his indifference or abuſe. I ſeldom or never heard of a man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved commonly civil to a woman who had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him all ſhe could grant, nor knew a woman one forget a man, by whom ſhe was deſtroyed. I have an elegy before me, in which a lady ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined and forſaken, paints the general ſituation of the ſex in ſuch circumſtances, with no little ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and as the performance has much merit, I ſhall make no excuſe for tranſcribing a ſtanza or two, and ſubmiting them to the judgment of my readers.</p>

                  <hi>A free-born Engliſhman.</hi>] One who is continually bragging of liberty, and independance, when he has neither will nor property of his own, and laughs at the wretchedneſs of other countries, while he himſelf is indulged with no other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege than the right of nominating the perſon by whom he chooſes to be enſlaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magna charta.</hi>] An idle word made uſe of by the Populace, ſignifying a natural right of being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by laws which they conſtantly ſuffer to be trampled on, and an inherent claim to the poſſeſſion of thoſe privileges, which they have neither ſenſe or ſpirit enough to poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſecretary of ſtate.</hi>] A great officer in whom crimes are no crimes, and who, by a political ſpecies of infallibility, can exerciſe acts of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, without ever dreading the rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or regarding the poignancy of general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The lords of the ocean.</hi>] The ſenſible and ſpirited people of Great Britain, who have a naval force conſiderably ſuperior to all the other ſtates of

Europe put together, yet ſervilely do homage to a neſt of little African pirates on the coaſt of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, and pay a yearly tribute to a ſet of robbers, whom they ought to root out from the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An independent freeholder and lover of his country.</hi>] One who, on every election for a member of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſacrifices his conſcience to his conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, ſets up his dear country, and his darling freedom to the beſt bidder, yet impudently finds fault with his repreſentative for following ſo lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable an example, nor ſuffers any body to be a ſcroundrel, without reproach, but himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A peerage.</hi>] In former days an honour conferred upon ſuch as had rendered themſelves conſpicuous for their merit, and eminent for their virtues; but in the more modern ages it has been, in general, the wages of venality and corruption, and a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be purchaſed at a ſmaller price than everlaſting infamy and diſgrace.</p>

                  <hi>A bleſſed martyr.</hi>] A perjured prince, who broke his coronation oath in the moſt material of all points, governed without a parliament, impriſoned his ſubjects for refuſing to lend him money, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a falſe villainous proſecution for high treaſon, againſt a moſt deſerving nobleman, (the earl of Briſtol) whom he knew to be innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that lord had impeached the duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, whom he knew to be guilty; reduced his people to the dreadful neceſſity of taking up arms in their own defence, which produced the utmoſt confuſion in religion and ſtate; and by his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſſimulation when he was about to be reſtored, left it utterly impoſſible to confide in his honour, his humanity, or his oath; but drove the principal officers of the adverſe party in their own defence, to ſit in trial upon their ſovereign and ſentence him to death. — Truly a very bleſſed Martyr! — Had this prince been a private man, who would have dared to ſay a word in his defence, though ſuch a number of writers have pleaded his royalty, which ought to be an aggravation, as a conſiderable palliative, nay a total excuſe, for his crimes. —</p>

               <p>I AM never more diverted than when I ſee your grave important ſet of gentlemen who would paſs upon the world as men of extraordinary ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, running into a number of little petulancies, which they imagine themſelves to be conſiderably above, and fretting at the verieſt trifles we can think of, when they affect a ſuperiority of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the moſt ſtriking calamities of life are not ſufficiently powerful to diſturb.</p>
               <p>THIS ſpecies of philoſophers is generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of men who have much pride, or little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and who, through a contemptible ſort of vanity, make themſelves not a little leſs than human, that they may have an opportunity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the eyes of the injudicious to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more. Of this caſt was the elder Brutus, who paſſed ſentence of death upon his own ſons, without the ſhadow of a pang, yet, at another time, knocked one of his ſervants down for putting a grain of ſalt too much in his broth.</p>
               <p>BUT without going ſo very far back for inſtances of this extraordinary claſs of mankind, my old friend Frank Surly is one of the moſt remarkable, which it has ever produced.—Frank and I were bred together at Weſtminſter, and before he was twelve years of age, he was diſtinguiſhed from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0136400201:76"/>
every other boy in the ſchool by the uncommon moroſeneſs of his temper, and his contempt of thoſe puniſhments which the generality of his age and ſtanding, always held in the greateſt dread. — There were few lads in the whole ſchool ſuperior to Frank either in application or abilities, yet I have known him frequently inattentive and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about his leſſons, that we might ſee with how much fortitude he could bear to be flogged.—Nay, if any of his intimates had been guilty of any roguiſh prank which deſerved the diſcipline of the rod, he would often deſire them to lay the blame on him, and ſuffer, with all the compuſure in the world, a hearty flagellation in their ſtead. — Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily however, upon one of theſe occaſions, when Frank was going to be puniſhed for ſome petty crime, which he begged might be laid to his charge, the lad who was really guilty of the fact, ſtruck with his behaviour, went up to the maſter, and without diſguiſe, related the affair, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the fault, and declared he would rather be cut to pieces than ſee another ſuffer for an action which he had committed himſelf. — The lad's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity had an effect upon the maſter, nor was he without ſome ſurprize at the behaviour of Frank.—He diſmiſſed them both to their ſeats, and, to the inexpreſſible concern of the latter, never flogged him after. — Frank finding he could have no opportunity of ſhewing his ſtoiciſm any longer, through downright pride, paid an application to his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0136400201:77"/>
ſtudies, that in a little time made him the beſt ſcholar in the whole ſchool, and reſolving to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the extremities of his behaviour, the moment the maſter had declared he would never gratify him with another whipping, he grew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably well behaved, and piqued himſelf upon keeping up a conſequence and dignity in his actions, to prove that the fear of puniſhment had nothing to do in the reformation of his manners.</p>
               <p>THE ſame diſpoſition which diſtinguiſhed Frank in his earlier years, has all along rendered him conſpicuous ſince his reach to maturity. — As he and I ſtill hold up an intimacy, whenever I go down into Oxfordſhire, I paſs a week at his houſe. — The laſt time I was there, he was laid up with a very violent fit of the gout, and whenever the pain was at an extremity, he would converſe with unuſual chearfulneſs, or divert himſelf with one of the ſongs which was in vogue when he and I were younkers. — If any body pitied him, he inſtantly flew into a paſſion; but if you ſeemed to make ſlight of bodily anguiſh and infirmity, he ſhook you by the hand, and told you, you were a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. — About ten years ago, my old friend married a moſt valuable woman, of whom he was paſſionately fond, and who returned his affection almoſt to madneſs. — As their circumſtances were affluent, this reciprocal regard, one would imagine, ſhould have produced their mutual felicity: — But far on the contrary, — Frank was too proud to be happy, and as his love for Mrs. Surly was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0136400201:78"/>
known to be exceſſive, he was never ſatisfied, unleſs he treated her as the object of his hate. — He only lived in her looks, and yet he has torn himſelf from her preſence for three whole weeks, and ſo unaccountably headlong was he hurried by this ridiculous ſtoiciſm, that, upon her death, which happened in childbed, though his ſoul was tortured with all the anguiſh of conſummate pity and diſtracted love, he went to the aſſembly an hour after her deceaſe, and ſat up — (a tear now and then ſtraying down his cheek) — along with Colonel Tierce, Major Piquet, and Sir Oliver Ombre, at a party of whiſt.</p>
               <p>A PERSON ſo apparently ſteeled againſt the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of life, we ſhould reaſonably expect, would hold the little impertinencies or interruptions of it in the greateſt contempt: but this is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe with my friend Frank. — A plait more or leſs in his ſhirt ſleeve will ſet him raving for an hour, and I remember that he ſhot a favourite Dog one day, in the ſtable-yard, for leaping accidentally up and dirtying the ſkirt of his coat. — It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to enumerate the various inconſiſtencies of my poor friend's character. — I once knew him ſet up a careleſs drunken fellow of a coachman, who overturned him in a ditch, in a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inn, three weeks after; and at another time diſcharge his footman at a moment's warning, for wearing too little powder in his wig.</p>
               <p>WERE we to make an eſſay into human nature, and examine the lives of our modern philoſophers
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0136400201:79"/>
with any degree of circumſpection, we ſhould find the principal number approach ſo very near the ſtandard of Frank Surly, that the account given of him will ſerve as no improper deſcription of them all. — The ridiculous light in which one of the moſt ſenſible is ſet, will, I hope, ſerve for as good an admonition as I can poſſibly give to this tribe of very important beings; and I ſhall think myſelf particularly happy if the foregoing picture is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any ſalutary effect.</p>

               <p>I did myſelf the pleaſure a few evenings ago to call at the houſe of an old friend, with whom I have been intimate theſe thirty years, and for whom I have infinitely more than a common reſpect. An affair of arbitration had, however, called him abroad, and I found no-body at home but Miſs Maria his younger daughter, who is now the moſt lively picture of innocence and beauty which I ever ſaw, and cloſely bordering upon twenty-one. As I always avoid ſtiffning my converſation with the ſtarch of antiquity, and conſtantly endeavour at appearing more ready to be inſtructed than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, the young people are very fond of admitting me into their company; and there is ſcarcely a day that I have not an invitation or two from ſome of the moſt ſprightly tea-tables in town, which is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0136400201:80"/>
more, I fancy, than can be ſaid by any other old fellow of ſixty within the weekly bills.</p>
               <p>ON my enquiring for her papa, Miſs Maria ſtepped out of the parlour, and ſeizing one of my hands, cried, "O Mr. Babler, is it you? I inſiſt upon your coming in." Few intreaties are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make a man do what he likes. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately aſſented, ſat down, and paſſed two of the moſt agreeable hours I ever experienced in my whole life.</p>
               <p>OUR converſation, after turning upon a variety of topics, at laſt fell upon that divine part of our church-worſhip, in which the congregation ſing praiſes to the moſt high. If it is proper, ſays Maria, for a perſon of my years to ſpeak of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a ſubject as religion, and not too preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous for the petticoats to comment upon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the church, I ſhould think, Mr. Babler, that this part of our liturgy might be very much improved. Great complaints have been often made, that ſo ſmall a number of the congregation join in the ſinging of pſalms, and though I admit the neglect is highly unpardonable, and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure extremely juſt, yet reformation would, in my opinion, be infinitely ſuperior to reprehenſion, and I think every room for complaint might be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a proper ſuppreſſion of the cauſe.</p>
               <p>THE end of poetry and muſic, if I am right in my information, is to actuate upon the paſſions, and, in all religious compoſition, to raiſe the mind to an elevated deſire of acknowledging the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0136400201:81"/>
mercy and goodneſs of the divine Being. How far the hymns uſed in the eſtabliſhed church for this purpoſe are from anſwering ſo ſalutary an end, it is no leſs painful than unneceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: in the verſification of the very beſt pſalms all the rapture of the original text is loſt, and in that the muſic ſhould be no way ſuperior to the poetry; there is hardly any one tune which can create the leaſt emotion but ſleep. In fact, Sir, the moſt triffling compoſitions, which are form'd for the buſineſs of amuſement, have twenty times more merit than thoſe ſet apart for the ſervice of religion, and infinitely greater pains are taken in the writing or ſetting of a Ranelagh ballad, than in a hymn to the honour of the living God.</p>
               <p>FROM what I have ſaid, Mr. Babler, I would by no means infer, that either the poetical or muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of our hymns ſhould be light, trifling or airy; but ſurely, Sir, the ſpirit of devotion would breathe conſiderably ſtronger in theſe pieces, and have a much greater effect, if an author of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould give us a fine verſification of the pſalms, and a maſter of eminence ſhould receive proper encouragement to ſee them exquiſitely ſet. We have a number of tunes plaintive, ſolemn and enchanting to a miracle, which are nevertheleſs as familiar as they are charming, and calculated to bewitch the careleſs and inattentive to a ſenſe, to a paſſion for that duty which they now treat with a lifeleſs indifference, or an inſupportable neglect. Religion, Sir, by this means, would become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0136400201:82"/>
and it would be deemed no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elegant for a fine lady or a fine gentleman to join in the praiſes of their God.</p>
               <p>LORD, Mr. Babler, how can you have patience to hear me chatter ſo much, but I ſhall not treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs on your patience much longer. Mr. Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth (who you know viſits us every day) and I were talking on this very ſubject a few evenings ago, and as he has a really ſweet taſte for poetry, I took the liberty of requeſting he would write me a hymn, whether penitential or thankſgiving, I left to himſelf. He called on me this morning and brought it in his hand. I think it mighty pretty, and ſhall be very happy, if my opinion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a ſanction as yours, Mr. Babler. Mr. Wellworth read it to me with great ſenſibility, and I own I thought he never looked ſo well in all his life.</p>
               <p>SOME how or other my eye encountered with Miſs Maria's at the end of this ſpeech; ſhe ſeemed conſcious, and on my obſerving that Mr. Wellworth was an excellent young man, ſhe reddened exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and ſeemed at a ſtand for words. As I would not confuſe her by any means, I ſhifted the converſation; but ſhe reſumed it immediately, and ſaid, well, Mr. Babler, you muſt give me your ſentiments on this little production, here it is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, taking it out of her pocket-book,—and here; no not here, but in the next number I ſhall preſent it with ſomething elſe of conſequence, which it occaſioned to my readers.</p>

               <p>WHEN I had done reading, Miſs Maria de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my opinion of this performance, which I could not but praiſe very much. — I told her how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the thought of concluding every ſtanza with the name of the Deity, was borrowed from Eve's hymn, in the death of Abel, though I could not think of making any compariſon, pretty as that hymn was, with this of Mr. Wellworth's — The young lady ſeemed vaſtly delighted at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0136400201:85"/>
and was beginning to make a verbal acknowledgment of her ſatisfaction, when her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's rap was heard at the door — My old friend entered the parlour with an air of mingled anger and dejection, and inſtead of taking any notice of me, began at once upon his daughter — <q>So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, this is fine information I have received — What you are under an engagement to Mr. Wellworth are you? O! Maria, Maria!</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſecret was now out, and I found my ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of Miſs Maria's attachment had conſiderably more than a tolerable ground. The poor girl ſtood quite confounded, and ſeemed utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making a reply. As I ſaw nothing cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in her regard for a worthy young fellow, I took upon me to intercede in her behalf, and at laſt reduced her father to the temper I could wiſh. I found a diſparity of fortune was the only objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the old gentleman had to his daughter's choice; for though my friend has as benevolent a heart as any man alive, yet he has the caution of all old fellows, and keeps a ſtrict eye on the main chance. When I had brought him to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of good humour, I took an opportunity of turning the converſation, and read him the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going hymn. He was charmed with it, and aſked me if I knew the author. "Yes, ſays I, Mr. Wellworth." <q>Fore God, (returned he) though I do not approve of his connection with my daughter, I am mightily taken with his works.</q> This was all I wanted, <q>and pray my good Sir,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0136400201:86"/>
(anſwered I,) which is it more for your credit and your child's happineſs, to beſtow her on a deſerving young man, whom ſhe loves, and you cannot but admire, or to run the precarious iſſue, of matching her with one, who, though he may have twice Mr. Wellworth's fortune, either may not have ſenſe or inclination, to reward either her merit, or your goodneſs, as he ought—you can ſettle them both, if not ſplendidly, at leaſt elegantly, in the world, and my life for it, in a year or two, you would not change your ſon in-law for the Indies.</q> I ſaw my old friend was ſtruck with the juſtice of the caſe, yet ſtill he ſeemed deſirous of being perſuaded to act, as he knew he ought—I indulged him, and Saturday laſt he and I obtained a ſpecial licence, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible happineſs of the young folks, got them married that morning.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AS I find it ſo very cuſtomary for people of all denominations to give a ſketch of their lives and to publiſh any particular inſtances of folly, or extraordinary turns of fortune, to the world, I take the liberty of ſending you a portrait of myſelf, in which, abſtracted from it's being a ſtriking likeneſs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0136400201:87"/>
I ſhall claim no merit, unleſs it be allowed a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral one.</p>
                  <p>I AM the only ſon of a tradeſman, who died about five years ago, in the city, Mr. Babler, and left me in very handſome circumſtances. My father had a common-council ſort of pride about him, which aſpired at bringing up his ſon a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and an ambition of making him carry an air of profuſion, while the moſt rigid oeconomy was obſerved in his expence. I have been tricked out, Sir, in the very pink of city finery, a laced waiſtcoat and a bag wig, at a time that I was ſcarcely allowed a ſufficiency to pay my club at the Horſeſhoe and Magpie, and talked about tavern bills and ſupper, when half a guinea has been the extent of my finances for a whole week.</p>
                  <p>UPON the death of old Squaretoes, Mr. Babler, I found myſelf poſſeſſed of ten thouſand pounds, and ſcarcely got a wink of ſleep, during a whole month, my imagination was ſo perpetually haunted by the recollection of the ſum. Habituated, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to the ſight of the money, I ſoon began to entertain a notion of laying a few hundreds ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly out. With this view a carriage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beſpoke, an everlaſting leave taken of all the ſtreets between Temple-bar and White-chapel, and a handſome apartment furniſhed at the other end of the town. The three formidable letters of E, S, and Q. were quickly added to my name, and having a ſtrong inclinat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on to be thought, I fancied in reality that I was, a fine gentleman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0136400201:88"/>THE firſt ſix weeks after it came home, I ſpent at leaſt fourteen hours a day in my coach. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared every where, ſaw every thing, and upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing days frequently invited ſome of the alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to a diſh of chocolate. Indeed one accident happened at my firſt going to court which made me not a little taken notice of; I never before had preſumed to put on a ſword, and being in the circle making my bow, it unfortunately got between my legs, and threw me on my face; in order to ſave myſelf from falling, I laid hold of an officer's ſkirt, who was juſt near me, and held it with ſuch a force, that I dragged him with me down. The whole drawing room was in a roar; the ladies tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the men burſt into a horſe-laugh, and even the face of majeſty itſelf relaxed into a ſmile. As ſoon as poſſible I picked myſelf up, and retired; the officer did the ſame, and as I had been the cauſe of his diſgrace, I made him a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of apologies, and took him home to dine: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted, a reciprocal eſteem was cordially expreſſed, and my new acquaintance talking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about a ſcarcity of money, he did me the favour to borrow fifty pieces, and gave me a poſitive aſſurance of coming to breakfaſt the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>HE was better than his word; he came and brought half a dozen brother officers in his hand. We dined at Almacks; drank Burgundy till we were blind; — ſcoured the ſtreets, and beat the watch. The frolick was new to me, Mr. Babler,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0136400201:89"/>
I was charmed with it, and behaved ſo well, that my companions honoured me with the name of a very honeſt fellow, and ſwore it was a damn'd pity I was ſo aukward with my ſword.</p>
                  <p>THESE being the firſt gentlemen I ever had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with, it is no wonder I treated them with extraordinary reſpect, bred up to an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with none but ſellers of linen, and dealers in packthread, I conſidered every man with a laced coat and cockade, as infinitely my ſuperior, and endeavoured, with a ſedulity of an uncommon nature, to imitate what I ſo paſſionately admired. Happily my endeavours ſucceeded ſo well, that in a little time I ſwore, got drunk, broke windows, kicked waiters, and inſulted modeſt women with as good a grace as if I had been colonel of a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>IN theſe faſhionable amuſements I waſted away above half my fortune in two or three years, with no other character than that of a very honeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; when a ſpirited rape on the daughter of my taylor, took away two thouſand pounds to huſh a proſecution and make it up. The action increaſed my reputation, but hurt my circumſtances much: I had not now as much more left in the world. — I was diſclaimed by my relations, and deſpiſed by my father's ſober friends. One half of my companions had died, and the other half were in danger of a jail. The ſame misfortune ſtared me in the face; my debts were numerous, my creditors preſſing; diſcharged they were obliged to be, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0136400201:90"/>
were, and when every thing was finally ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, I found myſelf, inſtead of having increaſed my ten thouſand, to have no more than ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty pounds left.—What was to be done? I could not bear the thoughts of going back into the city, and underſtood no buſineſs if I did. A lieutenancy offering, I purchaſed it as the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, and am now ſtarving upon the half pay. A ſtriking example of ignorant pride and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred prodigality; at once the warning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our ſhewy little citizens.</p>

               <p>UNFASHIONABLE ſoever as it may be to enter upon religious ſubjects in ſuch an age as the preſent, there are ſome who I flatter myſelf will nevertheleſs pay a little attention to a topic of ſuch importance without a bluſh, and think it no diſgrace either to their gentility or their underſtanding, to employ a few moments in the conſideration of ſome points, for which, at the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0136400201:91"/>
awful period of their diſſolution, eternities upon eternities will hardly ſeem too much.</p>
               <p>WHEN we conſider the differences which daily ſubſiſt in the various modes or ſyſtems of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, and think upon the inflexible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality which every man entertains in favour of his own, we ought to be abſolutely certain that the particular form which each of us glories to poſſeſs, is perfectly conformable to our notions of the Deity, and conſiſtent in the minuteſt degree with thoſe divine leſſons which were inculcated by the Saviour of the world, in his myſterious miſſion to man. — If we are not poſitive in this, let our belief be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by what name ſoever we think proper, let us be proteſtants or papiſts, quakers or preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, I can take upon me to aver, that we have no right to the name of chriſtians, and may with equal propriety, take a leſſon from the ALCORAN as the GOSPEL.</p>
               <p>IT is not the ceremony uſed at baptiſm, the ſprinkling of water, nor the promiſes of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the preſence of GOD, which conſtitute the CHRISTIAN; no, it is an actual conformity to the precepts of our BLESSED LORD, and an undevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating obedience to the tenets which are laid down in the hiſtory of his life and miracles. — Nothing can be more abſurd, nor in reality more criminal, than for a man to aſpire at the glorious title of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who is regardleſs of the duties which that appellation renders indiſpenſibly neceſſary; or a ſtranger to the obligations which are particularly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0136400201:92"/>
enjoined by the name; it is at once a fatal decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own moſt important expectations, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to his <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a defiance of his <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WITH what propriety ſhall I beg leave to aſk, can the various ſects of religion in this kingdom call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when, in the unremitting hatred which they conſtantly entertain towards one another, they utterly deſtroy that univerſal principle of <hi>Charity</hi> which ought to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, nay, the very eſſence of their belief. — With what propriety can he, who is bleſt with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded affluence, ſtile himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> if his ear is turned away from the ſight of affliction, or his heart unaffected with the tear of diſtreſs. — <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> obliges him to a conſtant relief of the wretched; and without a behaviour entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the duties of this belief, what poſſible pretention can he have to a name that exalts him to a fellowſhip with angels, and lifts him above the ſtars? — Will a conſtant attendance on the public place of his worſhip, exculpate the oppreſſor of the widow and the fatherleſs, or give the name of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to the villain who infamouſly lifts a dagger to the breaſt of his benefactor, or baſely ſtrives to murder the reputation of his friend? — Can the betrayer of unſuſpecting innocence think on the pangs of ſome violated virgin, left without aſſiſtance, without comfort, without bread: expoſed to all the upbraidings of a relentleſs world, to aggravate the ſeverity of her own reflexions, and poſſibly plunged in the additional miſery of having a helpleſs little
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0136400201:93"/>
innocent, and an unalterable affection for the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by whom ſhe is ſo cruelly undone? I ſay can the perpetrator of an act like this, ſit down calmly, ſatisfied with the rectitude of his behaviour, and think himſelf as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſincerely acquitted to his <hi>God?</hi> Alas, if any man thus culpable can be ſo preſumptuouſly daring as to think himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> it is doubtful whether he is moſt a reprobate or an idiot, or whether he is moſt regardleſs or ignorant of his crimes.</p>
               <p>IN every profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith there is a number of good natured people who are always uneaſy about the fate of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly afflicted leſt the ignorant ſavages of <hi>America</hi> ſhould not, at the laſt day, be received into the favour of the <hi>Supreme Being.</hi> — Theſe people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſtrange notions of the <hi>Deity,</hi> if they can ſuppoſe that a power <hi>all-wiſe, all-merciful,</hi> and <hi>all-juſt,</hi> will require, at the hands of ſuch ignorant nations, a knowledge which he has not thought proper to beſtow: a ſuppoſition of ſuch a nature is highly derogatory to the divine eſſence; it is a tacit implication that the <hi>great father</hi> of the univerſe exerciſes a ſeverity, which would be cruel in his creatures but to think of; and a palpable inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that the <hi>Being of beings,</hi> is capable of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny which would utterly degrade the meaneſt, in the human race, among the wonders of his hand. — No, from ſuch only, as have received much, much is expected; and perhaps at the laſt day, myriads of our <hi>nominal</hi> chriſtians, who look
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0136400201:94"/>
upon the <hi>American Savage</hi> with pity or contempt, would give a hecatomb of worlds, had they power to change ſituations, to ſee ſo little to anſwer for, as him: conformable to what he knows, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably regulates the tenor of his conduct, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an unalterable reverence for ſome great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which he looks upon as his God, and pays an implicit obedience to his laws; whatever his ſyſtem of belief may be, he endeavours to do it all the honour in his power, and ſhudders at nothing ſo much as the thought of bringing it into diſgrace. — Who amongſt us can honeſtly ſay the ſame? Enlightened with the lamp of ſcience and the ſun of true religion, <hi>our</hi> actions are a perpetual ſtigma on our belief; we acknowledge the wonderful merceies of a <hi>Suffering Redeemer,</hi> yet are continually uttering blaſphemies againſt his name; we own the infinite merits of his goſpel, and yet act in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradiction to every precept it contains; the Deity, we are ſenſible can think us into aſhes for the enormity of our crimes, and yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to behave in open diſobedience to his will; in ſhort, both hoping and fearing the exiſtence of another world, we ſacrifice every valuable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in this, and conſtantly boaſting the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages accruing from our religion, we are always acting as if we had no religion at all. — Let us, therefore, inſtead of condemning the errors of our neighbours, begin with correcting whatever is amiſs in ourſelves; and inſtead of finding fault with the religion of other people, be ſatisfied that <hi>real</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0136400201:95"/>
chriſtianity is the baſis of our own. — The whole myſtery, both of religion and government will be found in theſe admirable lines of Mr. Pope.</p>

               <p>IN the city of Bagdad, ſo celebrated by the ſages of antiquity, lived Oraſmin, the ſon of Ibrahim, whoſe name was an Aromatic that perfumed the remoteſt corners of the Eaſt. His perſon was as noble as the riſing oak in the foreſt, and his mind as unſullied as a meridian beam from the ſun; his bounty wiped away the tear from the eye of the fatherleſs, nor did the mourning of the widow ever paſs unregarded at his gate. — To ſum up his character at once, complacency and benevolence were always ſeated on his brow, and humanity
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0136400201:96"/>
was a virtue ſo natural to his heart, that it formed the very core, and twiſted round the ſtrings. Thus amiable, it was no wonder, that by all who ſaw him he ſhould be inſtantly admired; and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, no way ſtrange, that by all who knew him he ſhould be cordially reſpected and beloved.</p>
               <p>AMONG a variety of virgins who languiſhed for Oraſmin, Almira, a damſel of Balſora, newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Bagdad, was the only perſon bleſt with a reciprocal eſteem; the bluſh of the morning was leſs roſy than her cheek, and the diamond of gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda not ſo brilliant as her eye; her boſom was as white as the ſwan upon the waters, and gentle as the midſummer murmur of the ſtream. — How oft O ye groves of Balſora, have ye echoed with the ſame of her beauty! how oft, O ye vallies of Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad, have ye reſounded with her praiſe. You know that her voice would chain the tyger of the deſart, and unnerve the wild ſtag as he darted from the hill; you know that the ſpices of Ormus could not equal her in breath, nor the daughters of paradiſe excel her in dignity and grace.</p>
               <p>ORASMIN and Almira were not more diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their merit, than remarkable for their loves; and as neither had any parent living to oppoſe their wiſhes, a day was appointed for the celebration of their nuptials, to the univerſal ſatisfaction of their friends.—Oraſmin, all impatient for poſſeſſing the only object that had ever engroſſed his heart, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the happy hour with the utmoſt anxiety, and feaſted his imagination continually with the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0136400201:97"/>
raptures he was to experience in the arms of Almira. She not leſs impatient, though more confined in her expreſſions of the approaching felicity, painted equally warm to her fancy, the uninterrupted enjoyment of all ſhe held dear, and counted over the weeks, the months, and the years, ſhe had a probable expectation of paſſing in the tendereſt intercourſe with her adored Oraſmin. — But alas! while our lovers were thus enhancing the preſent, by reflecting on the future, an order arrived for Almira to attend the Caliph, who had for ſome time been entertained with various reports of her unparallelled beauty, and wanted to ſee if the encomiums laviſhed ſo frequently upon her, Were juſt. Neither her religion nor her allegiance could allow her to form any excuſe for not attending the <hi>commander of the faithful,</hi> much leſs admit of a reſolution to diſobey; he was worſhipped with an implicit reverence, as a ſucceſſor of the holy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, by all his people, and his word was ever looked upon as the irrevocable voice of Fate. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira therefore was immediately carried with a bleeding heart to the palace, and the moment ſhe was beheld by the Caliph, declared the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of his queens.</p>
               <p>IT is not in language to tell the diſtraction of the two lovers, at being thus unexpectedly torn for ever from each others arms; the moment Oraſmin heard that his Almira had captivated the Caliph, he looked upon the buſineſs of life to be entirely over, and unable to ſupport the inexpreſſible agonies
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0136400201:98"/>
of his own mind, conſidered the angel of death as the only miniſter of repoſe: for two whole days and nights he wandered through the various rooms of his houſe in an abſolute ſtate of phrenzy, calling out at every interval in the moſt paſſionate tone, on the name of his raviſhed Almira. On the third day, growing ſomewhat calmer, he began to reflect on all the circumſtances of his paſt life, in order to find out in what particular he had given Mahomet ſuch unpardonable offence, as to meet with ſo ſevere a chaſtiſement at his hands. After revolving a long time, and finding nothing but ſome youthful indiſcretions to anſwer for, which were infinitely overballanced by a number of meritorious actions, he inſenſibly dropt upon one knee, and began to expoſtulate, in the following manner, with his God:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THOU great creator of the univerſe, who ſits't enthroned above the ſeven heavens, where even the conception of no prophet but the holy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, can dare to ſoar: look down in mercy on a wretch, who numbers himſelf with the moſt unhappy of human beings, though he has conſtantly maintained the deepeſt reverence for thy laws; tell him, O thou infinitely high! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, O thou inexpreſſibly juſt! why he, who has ever made it his unalterable ſtudy, to deſerve thy awful ſanction on his deeds, is deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer what the moſt impious prophaner of thy divine will, would look upon as a ſeverity,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0136400201:99"/>
and confidently exclaim, was too great a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the moſt enormous of his crimes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ORASMIN had ſcarcely ended, when a clap of thunder ſhook the houſe, and an unuſual bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lightened the room, where he ſtill continued on his knee, aſtoniſhed at this apparent meſſage from the Deity. — When he recovered himſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a voice as awful as the trumpet of heaven, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him carefully to attend, and thus went on. — <q>Ceaſe, O miſtaken man, to doubt the mercy and juſtice of the Supreme Being, who though he acts by unknown ſprings and ſeeming ſeverities, is ever watchful for the happineſs of the virtuous, and perfectly conſiſtent in all his laws. — Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Oraſmin, that this world is a tranſitory bubble, which muſt ſhortly burſt upon the ocean of time; that it is at beſt but a ſhort voyage, in which every paſſenger muſt meet with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable gales, in order to prove his dependance on the hand of infinite goodneſs, and ſhew that he is worthy of entering into an everlaſting port. —Without ſome adverſe ſtorms to ruffle the ſea of life, the tide of proſperity would frequently ſwell the creature into a forgetfulneſs of the Creator, and reduce him to a more dangerous ſituation than the bittereſt blaſt he can expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, will ever bring him to; a total indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his God. Out of mercy therefore, a variety of ſhoals and quickſands are thrown in his way, which keeping the ſenſe of his dependance on the divine Being conſtantly alive in this world,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0136400201:100"/>
puts him in a capacity of ſteering his bark in the proper channel, and enables him to arrive at end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs happineſs in the next. — But abſtracted from this general order in the ſtate of things; know, Oraſmin, that becauſe thou wert a particular favourite of heaven, it was decreed to ſnatch Almira from thy arms: ſhe was, O man, thy ſiſter:—<hi>Ibrahim</hi> thy father, journeying to Balſora, was admitted to the Cade's wife, and the product of their guilty commerce was Almira: here again obſerve the kindneſs of heaven in it's very ſeverities, which, in order to deter the parent from the commiſſion of enormities, denounces a judgment againſt what he values more highly than worlds, his race — Oraſmin be comforted; I have viſited Almira, and informed her of theſe things; ſhe is at eaſe, remain thou ſo too, and remember never again to doubt the goodneſs of providence, which in it's own time will reward thoſe who place their confidence in it's hands.</q> Oraſmin after this lived many years in happineſs, and left many children, who ſucceeded to his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and fortune, the eldeſt of whom was grand viſier to the Caliph Haroun Alraſchid, and ordered theſe matters to be recorded in the hiſtories of Bagdad.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>FORTITUDE and conſtancy of mind are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to which every nation in proportion as it is civilized, lays a formidable claim, and to which however, very few, were we to examine the matter thoroughly, can have any tollerable preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beſides the compliment which on thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, each is ſo extremely liberal in paying to itſelf. In fact, it might not be difficult to prove, from every day's experience, that the propagation of the Sciences, while they improve, generally enervate the mind and that true fortitude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of ſoul, are more the reſult of a ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving conſcience, than the effect of an excellent underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>A NUMBER of philoſophers, who have aſtoniſhed the world with the greatneſs of their genius, and the extent of their reading, might talk very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily on this ſubject, but when they came once to put any of their own leſſons into practice, this boaſted reſolution, of which they imagined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poſſeſſed, diſappeared in an inſtant, and from deſerving the univerſal admiration of mankind, they became entitled to nothing but an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. CICERO, in his orations, might expreſs the greateſt diſregard of death he pleaſed, and tell us
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0136400201:102"/>
that a man ſhould not heſitate a moment, in ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his life for the good of his country; but the orator found the practice infinitely harder than the precept, and leagued himſelf with the enemies of the public after all, in hope of ſaving the life, which he affected ſo highly to deſpiſe.</p>
                  <p>WHO could talk better upon the virtues, or give more excellent leſſons of morality, than our own countryman my lord Saint Albans, yet who when he fell from the pinnacle of honour and preferment, ever ſhewed a greater ſervility of mind, or took more infamous methods to repair his ſhattered for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? — The moſt ſcandalous adulation that could be paid at court, he was conſtantly paying; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding after his diſgrace he was writing a book, which confers an honour on human nature, yet his intervals were taken up in defending every pernicious meaſure of the crown, and employed in deſtroying the liberty of his country. Need the cauſe of his diſgrace be mentioned here to prove, that notwithſtanding his wonderful abilities, he wanted fortitude to reſiſt the force of a trifling ſum of money, and honeſty to diſcharge the important duties of his truſt? or what ſhall we ſay of a man, who, while he was eſtabliſhing the higheſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of human genius, for two or three hundred pounds erected an everlaſting monument of human baſeneſs too. In reality, ſcience and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can do nothing more than teach our conſtancy and fortitude a nobler way of appearing, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities themſelves muſt proceed from a firmer foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0136400201:103"/>
than both — The wiſdom of SOCRATES gave <hi>a manner</hi> to his fortitude, which left an irreſiſtible charm in his death, but the fortitude itſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from the excellence of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the goodneſs of his heart.</p>
                  <p>BUT to prove beyond a poſſibility of diſpute, that a knowledge of the ſciences, has nothing to do in the qualities under conſideration, let us only refer to the behaviour of a poor Indian, as related by Lafitaw, taken in battle by his enemies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a ſacrifice to the manes of ſuch as either he himſelf or his countrymen deſtroyed in the field: — The moment he is condemned, he opens his death ſong, and is faſtened to a ſtake, the chiefs of the nation which has taken him, ſitting round a fire, and ſmoaking all the time. — Such as chooſe to be concerned in the execution, begin with torturing at the extremities of his body, till by degrees they approach the trunk; one pulls off all his nails from the roots; another takes a finger and tears off the fleſh with his teeth; a third takes the finger thus mangled, and thruſts it into the bowl of a pipe made red hot, and ſmoaks it like tobacco; others cut and ſlaſh the fleſhy parts of his body, and ſear the wounds immediately up with burning irons; ſome ſtrip the ſkin off his head, and pour boiling lead upon it; others tear the fleſh entirely from his arms, and twiſt the bare tendrils and ſinews round red hot irons, twiſting and ſnapping at the ſame time; ſome pound his fingers and toes to pieces between two ſtones, others all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0136400201:104"/>
the while diſtending and ſtretching every limb and joint, to encreaſe the inconceivable horror of his pains. During this, the miſerable ſufferer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rendered inſenſible by the torture, falls into ſo profound a ſleep, that they are obliged to apply the fire to recover him, and untie him, to give a breathing to the fury of their own revenge. — Again he is tied, and his teeth drawn one by one, his eyes beat out, and no one trace of humanity left in his viſage; in this ſituation, all over one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued mummy, one inexpreſſible wound, they beat him from one to another with clubs; the wretch now up now down, falling in their fires at every ſtep, till at laſt, wearied out with cruelty, ſome of their chiefs put an end with a dagger, to his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and terminates the execution, which often laſts five or ſix hours, by ordering on the kettle and making a feaſt as horrid and barbarous as their revenge.</p>
                  <p>BUT what renders this more ſurprizing, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt which ſubſiſts all the time between the ſufferer and them, whether he has moſt fortitude in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or they ingenuity in aggravating his pangs; at every interval they give him, he ſmokes unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reſt, without one murmur or ſhadow of a groan, recounts what exploits he has done, and tells them how many of their countrymen he has killed, in order to encreaſe their fury; nay he reproaches them with an ignorance of torturing, and points out ſuch parts of his body himſelf, as are more exquiſitely ſenſible of pain — The women
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0136400201:105"/>
have this part of courage with the men, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſoever as ſuch an aſtoniſhing conſtancy of mind may appear, it would be as odd to ſee one of theſe people ſuffer in another manner, as it would be to find an European who could ſuffer with any thing like their fortitude; an inflexible unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the principles in which they are bred is the occaſion of this fortitude, and without one ſpark of learning, occaſions a behaviour, which diſtances the moſt celebrated ſtories of antiquity, and baffles the profoundeſt leſſons of all the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</p>

               <p>FEW of the nobler qualifications are ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pretented to as Friendſhip, or a capacity of entertaining ſo cordial a regard for the intereſt of another perſon, as to make it equally an object of importance with our own. — I was talking laſt night with my old acquaintance Will Threadbare, on this very ſubject, at the Queen's Arms in St. Paul's Church-yard, when Will related over the hiſtory of his friendſhips to me for the ninety-ninth time, and concluded with his uſual invective againſt all the world, and the little confidence which is to be placed in the honour or honeſty of any man.— To ſave him the trouble of repeating his narrative again, I ſhall take take liberty of making it the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0136400201:106"/>
of the preſent paper; more eſpecially as I know the publication can be no way diſagreeable to him, and may probably prove of ſome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to my readers.</p>
               <p>FROM my very infancy up, Mr. Babler, ſays Will, I found that all thoſe attachments which we are weak enough to diſtinguiſh by the name of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, were nothing more than the effects of our folly or the conſequence of our deſign — A parity of ſentiments always created an intimacy between a couple of raſcals, who, willing to believe that they were capable of feeling the exalted glow of a virtuous friendſhip, imagined they really did feel it, and having once flattered themſelves with this opinion, reſted wonderfully pleaſed with the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, without ever examining the foundation upon which it was built.</p>
               <p>WHEN I was at Eaton, no two in the world could be more intimate; that is, in the language of the world, entertain a greater friendſhip for each other, than a fellow who now poſſeſſes one of the moſt valuable employments in the kingdom and your humble ſervant: how often have we ſwore that nothing ſhould ever ſeparate us when we came into the great theatre of life, as actors for ourſelves. — This regard we carried to ſuch an exceſs, that we have frequently boxed one another's battles, and always looked upon the leaſt affront offered to either, as an unpardonable injury to both. — But, alas, Mr. Babler, one Whitſun-Monday the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt, who was an old acquaintance of my father's
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0136400201:107"/>
took me out in a chaiſe with him to a neighbouring gentleman's houſe, and as my friend was not treated with the ſame diſtinction, he grew envious of his <hi>Pylades,</hi> behaved intolerably cold at our next meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I could not but obſerve, and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a little too tart in my reproaches, he took an occaſion to quarrel with me; the conſequence of which was that he and I never ſpoke a word toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after. This lad's eſteem for me commenced firſt of all from my dexterity in robbing orchards; an amuſement of which he was particularly fond, and therefore could not help eſteeming a temper that bore ſo ſtrong a reſemblance to his own; but as the baſis of our regard was ſo very trivial in itſelf, our friendſhip muſt be ſuppoſed to have but a ſlender ſupport, and therefore a miſunderſtanding was but a matter of courſe.</p>
               <p>AT Oxford I commenced an everlaſting friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to be ſure, with Ned Guzzle, becauſe I was unalterably attached to the bottle myſelf, and he was reckoned the hardeſt drinker in the Univerſity; our everlaſting friendſhip however continued but ſix weeks, for a couple of unlucky rogues pitted us againſt one another to drink for a rump of beef and a dozen of Maderia, in which it being my fortune to ſwallow half a pint more than my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, he wrote me a letter when he got up next evening, deſiring that all manner of correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence might be dropt between us for the future.</p>
               <p>WHEN I came up to town and got poſſeſſion of my little fortune, Dick Wildman and I were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0136400201:108"/>
we lodged in the ſame houſe, ſpent every evening at the ſame tavern together, and retired every morning with a ſtrumpet to the ſame bagnio under the <hi>piazza.</hi> — We were always coupled in our amours, and never attacked a milliner's apprentice or a tradeſman's wife unleſſ there were two to find us both employment in the ſame family. — This was not all; I once fought a duel for him behind Montague-houſe, and ran the double chance both of the gallows and cold iron: yet ſee the fatality attending all ſublunary things; Dick ſurprized me one morning in bed with one of the maids where we lodged, whom he had been ſoliciting for ſome time, though unknown to me, and was ſo offended at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable preference which the huſſey gave me, that he inſtantly ordered his man to pack up his things and decamped next day, without ſaying a ſingle ſyllable.</p>
               <p>I COULD recount a variety of inſtances where my friendſhips were equally unſucceſsful, though I never refuſed either my ſword, or my purſe, to any of thoſe partners of my heart; but finding by fatal experience, that no friendſhip is laſting which is not founded on Virtue, and believing in my ſoul, that there is not a ſpark of virtue in any man alive, — I am abſolutely determined never to have another friendſhip, but to ſtarve as decently as I can upon my ſeventy pounds a year, and to repeat that admirable ſentiment of Swift, when any well-behaved

               <p>I HAVE often told my ſubſcribers, that though conſiderably on the wrong ſide of fifty, an unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming

air of gaiety and freedom ſtill renders me tolerable to the ſociety of the young people, and that there is ſeldom a day in which I have not a viſit or an invitation from ſeveral to whom I might almoſt be a grandfather. — Among the many by whom I am thus favourably diſtinguiſhed, my ſiſter Rattle's youngeſt ſon Harry, treats me with a chearful familiarity, without ever tranſgreſſing the ſmalleſt bound of reſpect: — There is a ſomething in this young fellow, which, abſtracted from his affinity to me, I cannot help admiring: — An open ingenuity of carriage, mixed with a fund of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſenſe, are not the leaſt of his accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he has read a great deal, and what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more, he never took up an author without perfectly underſtanding him. — As well as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſcholar, Harry is really a pretty gentleman, and poſſeſſes no leſs a good heart than a fine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. — As my nephew's qualifications are very well known, it is impoſſible but every body muſt be fond of his company: This ſometimes leads him into foibles; and in ſpite of his good ſenſe, an eaſineſs of temper, that cannot reſiſt the ſolicitations of his friends, frequently runs him into errors, which with all my partiality for him, I can by no means approve, notwithſtanding the rogue would make any body overlook them by the ſelf accuſing honeſt and readineſs of his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions: Whenever I get Harry for a ſubject of diſcourſe, I ſcarce know how to end, I am ſo fond of dwelling upon what I cordially eſteem;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0136400201:111"/>
but not to treſpaſs upon the patience of my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are no way intereſted in his qualities, it is high time I ſhould proceed to the purpoſe I ſet out with, and aſſume the matter inſtead of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the man. — Well then, yeſterday morning Harry called upon me about eleven, his face ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and pale, his lips livid and ſwoln, a viſible fatigue ſpread all over his features, and his eyes ſunk in his head: I began inſtantly to open at the young rogue, gueſſing juſtly enough the cauſe of his rueful appearance, when he flopped into my great chair, and prevented all the ſeverity I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to treat him with, by being conſiderably more ſevere upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>MY dear Sir, ſays he, I am not worth your anger; advice is thrown away upon me; I ſin againſt the conviction of my own reaſon and am no leſs an obſtinate puppy, than a ridiculous fool.

               <p>I WISH Sir, you would ſay ſomething on this ſubject, and point out the monſtrous abſurdity, which generally prevails in a joyous evening;

when a few friends meet together, inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a rational converſation, you hear of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a toaſt and a ſong: the chairman calls in turn upon every one for his toaſt, and frequently puts us to a ſtand for the want of ſomething ſpirited or new: in this dilemma, obſcenity or prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but too general a reſource, and it is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common thing to hear men, of reputed underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, extol the name of ſome public proſtitute, and ridicule the precepts of their GOD.</p>
               <p>THE cuſtom of every man's ſinging in turn, is ſtill conſiderably more ridiculous, and commonly as prophane: at any of theſe joyous meetings, even I, who have a voice more diſagreeable than the grating of a gate upon hinges, and know no more of muſic than a Hottentot, can never get excuſed, but muſt make myſelf ridiculous in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting what I am utterly incapable of, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the very people who drive me moſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately on: how often have I been teized to ſing by a number of my intimate acquaintance, and yet the moment I began, there was no poſſibility of concealing their diſguſt; they whiſpered one another, gave a forced attention, or lolled inſipidly in their chairs, ſtroking the pleats of their ruffles, or playing with the chain of their watch, then longing impatiently till I had finiſhed, gave a faint bravo, and called out for a toaſt from the next member in rotation; whilſt I ſat frying the whole time, from a conſcious incapacity to pleaſe,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0136400201:113"/>
and a ſtrange neceſſity of giving a general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS, Sir, no cuſtom in the world is ſo very dangerous or unpardonable as toaſting; it levels all diſtinction in conſtitutions, and obliges a man in an indifferent ſtate of health, to drink as much as him that is bleſt with the ſtrength of a Hercules. It is the immediate parent of noiſe and intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and amongſt people of the beſt ſenſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers no other purpoſe but to leave them without any ſenſe at all.</p>
               <p>How prepoſterous a notion is it, my dear Sir, to ſuppoſe our joyous ſocieties ſtimulated by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of true benevolence or real eſteem; when every man has a deſign upon the weakneſs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his friend, and puſhes the glaſs about for no other purpoſe, but to prejudice his health and deſtroy his underſtanding: nay, when we make it our chiefeſt glory to have drank him out of all knowledge of order, all regard for himſelf, and all veneration for his God; when we reduce him to a ſtate of abſolute phrenzy or ſtupefaction, and either expoſe him to the numberleſs quarrels attending the firſt, or the multitude of accidents peculiar to the laſt of theſe ſituations; but Sir, I want to acquaint you with an affair of ſome conſequence: here Harry heſitated, and here I poſtpone the account of this affair, till my next paper.</p>

                        <stage>(interrupting)</stage> Then you own that ſhe is not worth quarrelling for, and yet make yourſelf ſo much a part of her, as to run the moſt extravagant lengths in her defence.—My dear Bumper, you may ſee from this the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of all toaſting; for you might as well run me through the body for not falling in love with any woman you think proper to mention, as be offended at my refuſing to drink her health. — The queſtion is not to be decided by the laws of cuſtom, but by the rules of reaſon; and what a figure muſt a man make in any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument where he denies truth and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a liberty to judge. — Upon the whole, Dick, if you are determined to cut my throat you muſt: but do not commit an unneceſſary murder to convince me of what I am already convinced, that you have ſpirit enough to reſent a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; nor ſeek out imaginary provocations to ſhew how ready you would be in chaſtiſing an abſolute affront.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>GREAT an oppoſition as there ſeems be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vanity and meanneſſ, yet if we take but ever ſo curſory a view of the world, we ſhall find them to be pretty general companions, and ſcarcely meet a ſingle inſtance in which there can be diſcovered any ſhadow of exception. — Among my own ſex particulary, Mr. Babler, vanity is the parent of ſo many meanneſſes, that I am actually ſurprized when we endeavour to give ourſelves moſt conſequence, that we never perceive how we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all the dignity we juſt before poſſeſſed; and in the ridiculous attempt of arrogating our own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, leave ourſelves in ſhort without any real importance at all.</p>
                  <p>THIS is never more the caſe, Sir, than when we liſten to the ſolicitations of your ſex, and for the ſake of a deſpicable compliment to our teeth or our complexion, overlook the unpardonable affront which it generally conveys, and take no notice of the very poor opinion it inſinuates both for the purity of our hearts and the rectitude of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. — We ſuffer the moſt illiberal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to be paid us, if they are but ſoftened with the words angel and goddeſs, and admit a deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing villain as often as he pleaſes into our preſence,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0136400201:120"/>
though we know our ruin and diſgrace are the only objects of his purſuit, if he but praiſes the colour of our hair, and tells us we are poſſeſſed of finer eyes than the reſt of our acquaintance. — In ſhort, Sir, we are willing a man ſhould think there is a probability of our launching into infamy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, for the ſake of hearing our perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and perfectly reconciled while he treats us on a footing with the handſomeſt women he may know, to his thinking, that in time he ſhall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us with the very worſt.</p>
                  <p>A WOMAN, Sir, whenever ſhe is told of her beauty with a grave face, ſhould firſt of all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the purpoſe for which ſhe may be addreſſed in this manner, and reflect upon the motive which may actuate the perſon who profeſſes himſelf ſo ſenſible of her perfections: — Nothing is more dangerous than to ſuffer continued repetitions of this ſtile; it gradually becomes more and more pleaſing to the ear, and there is, beſides, too natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a promptitude in the female mind to think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of thoſe who ſeem to think paſſionately of us. — A language of this nature, therefore, ſhould be highly alarming to our ears, for many a woman, who thought herſelf impregnable, has, in a length of time, grown ſo enamoured of her own praiſe, that ſhe could not poſſibly exiſt without the perſon who adminiſtered it, and has at laſt made a ſurrender at diſcretion, when had ſhe firſt of all capitulated on terms, ſhe might have inſiſted on the very beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0136400201:121"/>LET us only reduce the general tendency of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern addreſſes into plain Engliſh, Mr. Babler, and aſk the moſt indiſcreet of the ſex, if they can, in their conſcience, diſcover them to be a jot better than this— <q>Madam, I look upon you as a fool, and one whom I have a ſtrong inclination to make a ſtrumpet, for which reaſon I intend to talk continually of your charms, and by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing in that manner to your vanity, I have no doubt, but in a few days, I ſhall bring you to an utter diſregard of morality and virtue, to an abſolute contempt of all the laudable ſentiments which you have been imbibing ſo many years, and a total indifference for your own reputation and the honour of your ſex. As I think your wickedneſs equal to your folly, I beg, when I mention the word <hi>beauty,</hi> that you will prefer the gratification of the man who is your greateſt enemy, to the peace of thoſe who are your unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable friends; nor heſitate a moment to break the heart of a parent that tenderly loves you, to pleaſe an infamous ſcoundrel who labours for your everlaſting diſgrace. — In ſhort, Madam, I expect in return for a paltry compliment to your perſon, that you ſcruple not to endure continual ſhame in this world, nor ſhrink at ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding your eternal happineſs in the next; but run at once to plunge a dagger into the breaſt of your father, and hurl an impious defiance at the very throne of your God.</q>

                  <p>A LORD next told me I was the moſt angelic piece of fleſh and blood he had ever beheld, and ſolicited, in good earneſt, that I would bleſs him with my favourable opinion; but I had no ſooner talked of coronets on my coach, than the truly honourable earl ſneaked inſtantly off, excuſing himſelf on account of a treaty then in agitation with Lady Betty Squander.</p>
                  <p>WHAT you men think of us, Mr. Babler, I know not, nor indeed can I conceive what we wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in general think of ourſelves; but of this I am abſolutely certain, that while we continue ſo intolerably vain, we muſt be liable to an infinity of meanneſſes, and that the ſureſt way for any woman to be undone is to think there is nobody comparable to herſelf.</p>

               <p>OF all the requiſites eſſentially neceſſary to form a matrimonial felicity, a parity of ages may poſſibly be the very firſt; and if we were to take a nice ſurvey of the various diſproportioned matches which unhappily might be found within the Weekly Bills, the endleſs anxieties ſubſiſting between each, would be ſufficient to frighten any prudent parent from beſtowing his daughter's hand where there was not ſome equality of years; and at leaſt a probability that her reaſon would in time reconcile her to a huſband, who, perhaps, might not at firſt be the object of her choice.</p>
               <p>I AM very well aware, that many a careful father and antiquated lover, will be apt to exclaim againſt this aſſertion: the firſt from an oeconomical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the main chance, and the latter from a natural inſenſibility which every man entertains for his own imperfections and infirmities: but could the one be brought to a belief that wealth, at the beſt of times, is a very precarious founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for happineſs; and the other be only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to throw ſelf aſide for a moment or two, extraordinary as the poſition may ſeem on a partial conſideration, both would nevertheleſs allow it to be of no little force.</p>
               <p>CASUAL averſions may be leſſened in time, by an invariable tenderneſs, and an unexceptionable
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0136400201:124"/>
conduct in a huſband; perſonal defects, by being habitual to the eye, gradually leſſen on the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and by an uninterrupted familiarity, very frequently ceaſe to be diſagreeable, much more continue to give perpetual diſguſt: but a diſparity of years is an obſtacle never to be ſurmounted; every day gives it an additional force, and contrary to the general nature of all other evils, for in this caſe we muſt inevitably call it an evil, inſtead of being mitigated by the lenient hand of time, it becomes every moment more and more incapable of alleviation or cure.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides the long train of diſagreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions which the bare circumſtance of age is of itſelf capable of exciting in the boſom of any young woman, the innumerable liſt of diſeaſes, which are it's inſeparable attendants, occaſion ſtill ſtronger averſion; and in reality a young lady has but too much ground for anxiety and diſtreſs when ſhe conſiders herſelf as a ſacrifice to ſame venerable dotard, and inſtead of the reaſonable pleaſures ſhe might juſtly promiſe herſelf upon entering the world as a wife, ſees nothing before her but the gloomy proſpect of becoming a nurſe to an emaciated wretch, worn away with the conſequences of juvenile intemperance, and abſolutely dying with gouts, palſies, rheumatiſms, coughs, and catarrhs.</p>
               <p>CONTRADICTIONS ſo very oppoſite as extreme youth and age, there is hardly a poſſibility of reconciling; — a fine ſprightly girl of nineteen or twenty, muſt naturally wiſh for amuſements
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0136400201:125"/>
adapted to her time of life, and languiſh for ſuch enjoyments as are naturally repugnant to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as the infirmities of crazy fourſcore. The ſituation of ſuch a couple is eaſily imagined; the lady muſt be continually unhappy at being thus debarred, after the ſacrifice ſhe has made, from every entertainment ſuitable to her temper and her years, and the gentleman as conſtantly miſerable at poſſeſſing an impotent authority, productive of nothing but eternal ſuſpicions of her conduct, and the ſharpeſt reflexions on his own.</p>
               <p>IT is in vain to expect that the rectitude of a woman's education, thus circumſtanced, or the excellence of her underſtanding, will be a means of procuring even a tolerable tranquility or content; the more underſtanding ſhe poſſeſſes, the more ſhe muſt deſpiſe the ſelf-intereſted dotard, who was utterly regardleſs of her inclinations; who in all probability uſed his utmoſt influence with a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided and inexorable parent, to tear her from ſome deſerving young fellow on whom her ſoul was unalterably fixed, and perhaps, had her dragged to the bridal bed, like another <hi>Niobe,</hi> ſtiffning into horror, or diſſolving in her tears.</p>
               <p>IN a ſituation of this nature, how a man can be weak enough to look for tenderneſs or affection, from any young lady, is to me a miracle; nor am I leſs ſurprized how he can think of exciting her gratitude, by indulging her in trivial points, when he has ſo infamouſly injured her in the moſt capital
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0136400201:126"/>
of all; her everlaſting hatred and abhorrence are the only returns he can reaſonably look for, and if there is a poſſibility for her to view him with leſs than an inſuperable contempt, I am ſatisfied, he muſt look upon her as a creature utterly diveſted of ſenſibility and ſoul, and view her with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute contempt himſelf.</p>
               <p>AN infinity of reaſons might be urged againſt the diſparity of age in matrimonial connections, but as I have lately received a ſtory on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which will ſet this affair in a ſtronger light than a volume of declamatory arguments, I ſhall conclude the ſubject, for the preſent, with this obſervation, that he who marries a woman whom he knows has an attachment for another man, muſt look for wretchedneſs; and he that marries a woman contrary to her inclination, in reality deſerves it.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM one of thoſe unhappy old blockheads whoſe paſſions out-live the power of indulgence, and are perpetually dreaming of a marriage bed, inſtead of thinking ſeriouſly about the purchaſe of a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheet. — I am turned of ſixty-five, worn away to a ſkeleton by a variety of diſeaſes, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0136400201:127"/>
of my youthful indiſcretion, and am almoſt ſix months married to an amiable unhappy woman juſt bordering on twenty-two.</p>
                  <p>BEING laſt Eaſter, Sir, at my ſon's in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I accidentally ſaw a young lady who was intimately acquainted with my grand-daughter Sally, and whom, on enquiry, I found to be the daughter of a curate lately ſettled in thoſe parts, who had nothing to maintain a wife and four chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren but a ſlender forty pounds a year. — Maria, the young lady's name in queſtion, was the eldeſt, and had no other fortune than a moſt engaging perſon, an irreſiſtable face, a good heart, and a fine underſtanding. — Theſe however had procured her the addreſſes of one Mr. Markham, a very worthy young fellow in the neighbourhood, who had newly ſet up in the grocery trade, with a capital of 3000l. and who, by her father's permiſſion and the conſent of his own friends, was to be married to her on the Sunday fortnight following.</p>
                  <p>THERE was a ſomething ſo engaging about Maria, Mr. Babler, as ſtrangely affected me, and made me at once both very uneaſy and very much aſhamed. All thoughts of an intercourſe with the ſex at my time of life, I was ſenſible ſhould have totally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; yet, notwithſtanding a conviction of that nature, I was determined, if there was a poſſibility or my ſucceeding, to have her. — In vain my ſon pointed out the ridicule I ſhould incur by ſo diſproportioned a match; in vain did my daughter, nay my grand-daughter too, endeavour
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0136400201:128"/>
to laugh me out of ſo prepoſterous a deſign; and in vain did my own reflexion dwell upon the ſtriking diſparity of years, and the greatneſs of my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. — My authority ſilenced the remonſtrances of my children, and my vanity turned a deaf ear to the ſelf-convicted poignancy of my own. — The circumſtance of years I thought my generoſity would ſufficiently counterballance, and as for my diſorders, I fancied my cough was conſiderably abated, and that under a proper regimen, my gout might be rendered leſs troubleſome, and the rheum of my eyes totally removed. — I ſent for an empiric to make me a handſome ſet of teeth; exchanged my venerable tye, for a ſmart faſhionable bob, affected to read without ſpectacles, and threw by my crutch headed ſtick.</p>
                  <p>NOT to trouble you, Sir, Mr. Graſply, Maria's father, the moment I propoſed a jointure was in a tranſport; a promiſe of providing for his other children threw him into an ecſtacy, and the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a good living on my own eſtate, rendered him incapable of ſpeaking a ſingle word. — Maria, after a thouſand intreaties and as many floods of tears, not to be ſacrificed, as ſhe called it; and a vain attempt of eſcaping to her dear Mr. Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, was dragged to church in three days after, and came home Mrs. Totterly.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus fortunately ſecured her for my wife, I thought my felicity almoſt compleated, and that the moment her tears were a little dried up, I ſhould be the happieſt of men. — But alas,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0136400201:129"/>
Mr. Babler, I found a great difference betwixt the poſſeſſion of an unwilling hand and the enjoyment of a warm reciprocally beating heart: it required but ſmall penetration to diſcover that I was the object of her unalterable averſion, and that the violence I had done to her real inclinations would plant perpetual thorns on her pillow, and fix ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting anxiety on mine.</p>
                  <p>I WILL not trouble you, Mr. Babler, with a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of particular circumſtances; ſuffice it, that notwithſtanding I have uſed every method I could poſſibly deviſe to excite her gratitude or engage her eſteem, in the calmeſt of her moments, ſhe looks upon me with a rooted hatred, or a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſguſt.—I in vain tempt her with equipage and dreſs; if the carriage is ordered to the door ſhe has the head ach; and if I order home a freſh piece of ſilk, it is thrown neglected on the floor.— Inſtead of mixing with ſociety, ſhe ſhuts herſelf up the principal part of the day in her cloſet, and if I chance by accident to break in, I ſurprize her in tears.—If my infirmities oblige me to the uſe of a ſeparate bed, I am uneaſy at being from her, and yet I am miſerable by the horror ſhe expreſſes in her looks, if they do not: if ſhe chances to doze, the heavineſs of her ſighs diſtract me to the laſt degree, and if ſhe mentions the word Markham in her dreams, as ſhe frequently does, it is a ſcorpion of the moſt deadly na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0136400201:130"/>UPON the whole, Mr. Babler, aſleep or awake, at bed, or at board, I am the moſt miſerable of men; and what, like a ridiculous dotard, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied would prove the greateſt bleſſing of my life, by a juſt diſpenſation of providence, turns out my unalterable curſe.—O Sir, to a man not altogether deſtitute of ſenſibility, what ſituation can be ſo truly wretched as mine? without a friend to whom I can vent my griefs, without a boſom which I dare beg to pity my diſtreſs, to be deſpiſed by the woman I doat upon to madneſs, and to be a real object of contempt to myſelf, is too much! — to be loaded with years, and ſo born down with infirmities, as to ſtand one continued mummy of emac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>FROM my ſtory let other dotards beware of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my example; for be aſſured, Mr. Babler, wherever there is a ſtriking diſparity of years, and the odds againſt the man, a very little time will convince him of his error, and make him wiſh, with me, that he had ſent for an Undertaker and been buried fifty fathom quick before he made ſo prepoſterous a choice of a wife.</p>

               <p>I SUPPED laſt Night at my ſiſter Rattle's, where the diſcourſe turning upon the edudation of children, my favourite Harry related a little ſtory, with which I was prodigiouſly affected; and as it conveys a very pretty moral, I ſhall make no apology for preſenting it to my readers</p>
               <p>A WORTHY old gentleman, who had by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible induſtry acquired a large fortune, with great reputation, at length declining buſineſs; devoted his ſole attention to the ſettlement of an only ſon, of whom he was uncommonly fond.— In a little time he married him to a woman of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and judging of the ſon's affection by his own, made over every ſhilling he was worth to the young gentleman, deſiring nothing more than to be a witneſs of his happineſs in the ſame houſe, and depending upon his gratitude for any curſory trifle he might want, for the private uſe of his purſe. — The ſon had not been married however above ſix weeks, before he was under the ſole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of his wife, and prevailed upon to treat the old gentleman with the moſt mortifying neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. — If he wanted the carriage for an airing, why truly, "My Lady has engaged it:" If he deſired to mix in any little party of pleaſure, "They were quite full:" He was ſuffered to ſit whole evenings without being once ſpoken to;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0136400201:132"/>
at table he was obliged to call three or four times for a glaſs of wine, or a bit of bread, and if he ever entered into a narrative of any tranſaction which occurred in his youth, his obliging daughter in-law immediately broke in upon him, and politely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a converſation upon ſomething elſe. — This unpardonable contempt was at laſt carried to ſuch a degree, that his cough was complained of as troubleſome, and under a pretence that his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco box was inſupportable, he was requeſted to eat in his own room.</p>
               <p>FOUR or five years paſſed on in this manner, which were rendered a little tolerable by the birth of a grandſon, a moſt engaging boy, who, from the moment he was capable of diſtinguiſhing, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very fond of the old gentleman, and by an almoſt inſtinctive attachment, appeared as if providentially deſigned to atone for the unnatural ingratitude of it's father. — He was now turned of four, when one day ſome perſons of faſhion dining at the houſe, the old gentleman, who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the company, came down into the back parlour to enquire for his little favourite, who had been two whole hours out of his apartment: he had no ſooner opened the door, than his dutiful ſon, before a room full of people, aſked him how he dare break in upon him without leave, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to get inſtantly up about his buſineſs. — The old gentleman withdrew according to order, returned to his own room, and gave a very hearty freedom to his tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0136400201:133"/>LITTLE Tommy, who could not bear to hear his grand-papa chided at ſuch a rate, followed him inſtantly, and obſerving how heartily he ſobbed, came roaring down to the parlour, and before the whole company bawled out, <q>papa has made poor grand-papa break his heart; he will cry his eyes out above ſtairs.</q> — The ſon, who was really ſhamed of his conduct, eſpecially as he ſaw no ſign of approbation in the faces of his friends, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to put an eaſy appearance on the affair, and brazen it out; turning round therefore to the child, he deſired him to carry a blanket to grand-papa, and bid him go beg. — <hi>Ay, but I will not give him all the blanket,</hi> returned the child; — <hi>why ſo my dear?</hi> ſays the father; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (anſwered he) <hi>I ſhall want half for you, when I grow up to be a man, and turn you out of doors.</hi> — The child's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof ſtung the father to the ſoul, and held up at once both the cruelty and ingratitude of his conduct in their proper dyes: nay, the wiſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affected and wanted words: a good natured tear dropped from more than one of the company, who ſeized this opportunity of condemning, in a very candid manner, their behaviour to ſo effectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a father, and ſo bountiful a friend; and in ſhort, made them ſo heartily aſhamed of themſelves, that the old gentleman was immediately ſent for by both, who, in the preſence of all, moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreated his forgiveneſs for every thing paſt, and promiſed the buſineſs of their lives would be to oblige him for the future. — The poor old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0136400201:134"/>
joy threatened now to be much more fatal than his affliction a little before: — he looked upon his ſon and daughter for ſome time with a mute aſtoniſhment, mixed with a tenderneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be deſcribed; and then fixing his eyes upon the company with a wildneſs of inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rapture, ſnatched up his little Tommy to his boſom, who joined him in a hearty flood of Tears.</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing, in reality, where people are ſo very wrong, as the education of children, though there is nothing in which they ought to be more abſolutely certain of being right: if we ſeriouſly reflect upon the cuſtomary method in which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are brought up, we muſt almoſt imagine, that the generality of parents inculcate principles of religion and virtue into their offspring, for the meer ſatisfaction of bringing both religion and virtue into contempt; and paint the precepts of morality in the moſt engaging colours, to ſhew, by their practice, how much theſe precepts are to be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>MY friend Ned Headſtrong is a parent of this caſt; he is continually preaching up a rectitude of conduct to a very ſenſible young fellow his ſon, and yet as continually deſtroying by his example what he labours to effect by his advice. Ned expatiates largely about patience under the diſpenſations of providence, and yet will fly into a paſſion of the moſt ungovernable nature, if a leg of mutton is boiled a minute too much. — I have heard him launch forth in the praiſe of fortitude, while he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0136400201:135"/>
has not been able to overcome the chagrin occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by ſpilling a drop of port upon the table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth; and very frequently liſtened to a lecture againſt a profligate mention of the divine name, interſperſed with a variety of horrid execrations.</p>
               <p>THE ſame prepoſterous inconſiſtency in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of an only daughter is a diſtinguiſhing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar of lady Dye Dawd e. — Her ladyſhip is no great gadabout, for ſhe lies in bed all the day, and plays at cards all night; ſhe cannot be accuſed of miſbehaviour in church, for I am not ſuppoſe ſhe has been once at a place of public worſhip theſe twenty years. — A tradeſman can never call twice at her houſe for a bill, for there is not one who has the leaſt acquaintance with her character that would truſt her with a yard of ribbon or a row of pins. — Her reputation has never been ſuſpected, for there is not a man in England who would think it worth his while to accept of the higheſt favour ſhe ſhould poſſibly grant; and as for her veracity, that can by no means admit of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, for it is a queſtion with me if ſhe ſpoke a ſyllable of truth ſince her arrival at maturity. — Yet notwithſtanding all theſe negative perfections, ſhe is continually preſcribing a contrary practice to her daughter, and perpetually condemning the young lady for the leaſt imitation of what ſhe is unceaſing practiſingly herſelf.</p>
               <p>I SHALL conclude this paper with a bit of advice addreſſed to every order of my readers: — if a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in reality would have his ſon a good man, let
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0136400201:136"/>
him teach by his practice as much as by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and never, through a doating partiality, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look thoſe actions in a child which he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably condemn in any body elſe. Finally, let all parents, from the introductory part of this paper, conſider that it is no diſgrace for a ſon to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on a father's bounty, but that nothing can be more dangerous than for a father to be dependant on a ſon's.</p>

               <p>THERE is no ſet of men to whom I have a greater averſion than your profeſſed ſayers of <hi>bon mots,</hi> or ſputterers of <hi>good things,</hi> who go into company for no other reaſon in nature, but to catch at every little opportunity of being ſmart, and build a reputation of wit and vivacity upon the harmleſs peculiarities or caſual indiſcretions of their acquaintance. This ſpecies of impertinents, if we properly examine the principles upon which they act, are not more to be deſpiſed for the continual air of ſelf-ſufficiency they aſſume, than for the malevolence of their diſpoſitions, in wiſhing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concert, where real good-nature and true politeneſs ſhould be ſtudious to oblige. Yet notwithſtanding the greateſt number of theſe worthy gentlemen affect a ſuperiority of underſtanding above the reſt of the world, a ſenſible obſerver will find, that the very beſt is ſeldom more than a ſquirt charged
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0136400201:137"/>
with the trite relations of deſpicable jeſt books and common-place remarks, to be let off as occaſion may ariſe, in whatever company it may be their fortune to be introduced.</p>
               <p>AS the vanity of being admired engroſſes their whole ambition, a Wit of this claſs is not leſs a diſagreeable acquaintance than a dangerous friend: he is incapable of confidence, and where-ever a ſecret of the moſt important nature with which he is truſted, may unhappily interfere with an opportunity of gratifying his natural propenſity, his diſcretion is in an inſtant kicked down ſtairs by his pride, and the peace of a whole family, in all probability, ſacrificed to an indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate repartee, or an ignorant joke. Nay, no conſideration, either moral or religious, is able to reſtrain the torrent of his impertinence; and is it not too common a circumſtance, that where hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man obligations afford him no ſubject of exerciſing his talents, that he burſts at once through the moſt awful of the divine, and circulates a daring laugh at the mandates of his God! In ſhort the moſt bearable of this fraternity is always a plague to ſociety, and not very ſeldom a diſgrace.</p>
               <p>SHOULD we carry our ſpeculations on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſtill farther, it might probably be found, that one half of our modern infidels is produced by the abſurd affection of ſaying a good thing, and the deſire of being thought uncommonly ſhrewd by the generality of the world. In order to effect this, a ſingularity of opinion is firſt of all adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0136400201:138"/>
and the more dangerous this opinion is, the more it anſwers the purpoſe of being talked of, and renders the perſon who adopts it, pointed out from the ordinary claſſes of mankind. This ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſentiment of courſe occaſions a ſingularity of expreſſion, and the conſequence at laſt is, that the unhappy wretch who thus aims at univerſal admiration, jeſts himſelf out of every ſenſible and worthy man's eſteem here, and laughs away his hopes of hereafter too.</p>
               <p>AN old ſchool-fellow of mine, poor Dick Brazen, is one of thoſe men whoſe principal ſtudy is to attract the attention of their acquaintance by a ſmartneſs of repartee, and a poignancy of ſatire in the application of a joke. Dick's whole labour theſe forty years, has been to make himſelf a very diſagreeable companion; and I cannot help ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he has been no way diſappointed in his end. The moment he enters a room, and makes his bow, he ſits with the utmoſt patience to catch at any expreſſion which may admit of a ſarcaſm, and is ſure, without any regard to the condition or ſex of the ſpeaker, to uſe his beſt endeavours to turn it into ridicule or contempt. If nothing of this kind happens, he make himſelf the hero of ſome little tale, and perhaps tells a hundred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent ſtories for the ſake of relating what he ſaid upon ſuch and ſuch a circumſtance; how he put lady This-thing, out of countenance with an obſervation upon a pincuſhion, and cut up Sir John T'other, with a ſtroke upon a ſnuff-box. The
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0136400201:139"/>
worſt of all is, the ſame obſervation which that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated reprobate the earl of Rocheſter made on Charles the ſecond for the continual repetition of his ſtories, may, with all imaginable juſtice, be applied to Mr. Brazen. That monarch had a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of telling every day, in the circle, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand trifling occurrences of his youth, and would conſtantly repeat them over and over again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſmalleſt variation; ſo that ſuch of his courtiers as were acquainted with his majeſty's foible, would inſtantly retreat whenever he began any of his narrations.—My lord Rocheſter being with him one day, took the liberty of being very ſevere upon that head; <q>Your majeſty, (ſays he) has undoubtedly the beſt memory in the world; I have heard you repeat the ſame ſtory, without the variation of a ſyllable, every day theſe ten years; but what I think extraordinary is, that you never recollect you generally tell it to the ſame ſet of auditors.</q>—This is Mr. Brazen's fault, and indeed the fault of ever worthy member of his brotherhood; they are very happy in remembering every good thing they have ſaid, but conſtantly forget, they have retailed it perhaps five hundred times upon the ſame company.</p>
               <p>I SHALL conclude this paper with an anecdote of the identical Mr. Brazen, whom I have thus taken the liberty of introducing to my readers, and which I think is a general picture of all the clever fellows of this claſs within the bills of mortality. Being carried to ſup one night, by a friend, with a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0136400201:140"/>
company of very ſenſible people whom he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen before, Dick was ſo very much pleaſed, that he was extremely mortified, or in other words, found no opportunity of exerciſing his talent for <hi>bon mots.</hi> — Being aſked to the ſame party a ſecond time, <q>No, no, ſays he, I have been diſappointed already, and will never ſit twice in a company which I cannot laugh at, by G—d.</q>

                  <p>DURING the little ſpace of our marriage, Mr. Wellworth ſeemed to live for no other purpoſe, but to oblige me; and I hope it will not be looked upon as vanity if I ſay, my everlaſting ſtudy was to make every thing agreeable to him. — In ſhort, Sir, I ſcarcely imagined a hereafter could add to my felicity, nor formed a ſingle wiſh beyond the approbation of my huſband.</p>
                  <p>ONE evening, Sir, Mr. Wellworth ſupped abroad with a party of friends, and came home with a good humour which was viſibly conſtrained. — However as he repeatedly aſſured me that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was the matter, I rather accuſed myſelf of unneceſſary apprehenſion, than ſuppoſed he was really diſturbed.— That evening he was more than uſually tender to me, and paid an extraordinary attention to the children; he went up to the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, kiſſed each ſeparately three or four times, and bleſſed them with an uncommon energy of expreſſion. — We retired in a little time after, and judge my diſtraction, Mr. Babler, when my wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man woke me in the morning with the following letter?</p>

               <p>THERE is nothing at which I am more offended, than the unpardonable vein of ignorance and brutality ſo generally introduced in our drinking ſongs; nor any thing, in my opinion, which throws a greater reflexion upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a ſenſible ſociety. If we examine the principal number of theſe pretty compoſitions, we ſhall find, that abſolute intoxication is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the higheſt felicity in the world, and receive the moſt poſitive aſſurances of being upon an equality with angels, the very moment we ſink ourſelves into a ſituation conſiderably lower than men.</p>
               <p>To look back to the original deſign of all poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical compoſition is needleſs, ſince every body knows that it was to praiſe and honour the Supreme Being with a fervency of devotion, which could not be found in the common form of words. — This glorification of the Deity, and the inſtruction of his creatures, appearing therefore to be the grand view of poetry, how much is it to be lamented, that a ſcience of ſo ſublime a nature, ſhould be proſtituted to ſuch infamous ends; and, inſtead of being applied to the purpoſes of religion and virtue, be directed to the ſupport of a vice, productive of innumerable ills.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0136400201:145"/>IT has been juſtly obſerved, that every nation, in proportion as it is civilized, has aboliſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in wine, and conſequently muſt be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous in proportion as it is addicted to exceſs: — the remark I am rather apprehenſive will be found no very great compliment to the people of this kingdom; we are apt to place good fellowſhip in riot, and have but too natural a promptitude in imagining, that the happineſs of an evening is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by an extravagant circulation of the glaſs; hence are our ſongs of feſtivity, (as I have already taken notice) fraught with continual encomiums on the pleaſures of intoxication, and the whole tribe of Bacchanalian Lyrics perpetually telling us how wonderfully ſenſible it is to deſtroy our ſenſes, and how nothing can be more rational in a human creature, than to drink till he has not left himſelf a ſingle glimmer of reaſon at all.</p>
               <p>BUT if, abſtracted from the brutal intention of our drinking ſongs, in general we ſhould come to conſider their merit as literary performances, how very few of them ſhould we find worth a ſtation on a cobler's ſtall, or deſerving the attention of an auditory at Billingſgate; — the beſt are but ſo many deſpicable ſtrings of unmeaning puns and ill-imagined conceits, and betray not more the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their encouragers, than the barrenneſs of their authors. — Let me only aſk the warmeſt advocate for this ſpecies of compoſition, what, upon a cool reflexion, he thinks of the following ſong:</p>

               <p>THE foregoing little ſong, though one of the leaſt offenſive in the whole round of a <hi>bon vivant</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, has neither thought nor expreſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it, and can, when ſung, be termed no more than an agreeable piece of impertinence, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to ſupply a want of underſtanding in a company.

               <p>AN eaſineſs of behaviour through the common occurrences of life, is a point in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every perſon thinks himſelf an admirable proficient; yet it is nevertheleſs a matter in which almoſt every perſon is very widely deceived.

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0136400201:148"/>AN endeavour at an extraordinary degree of politeneſs, is a rock upon which numbers are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ſplitting, and what is moſt ſurprizing, the variety of examples, inſtead of deterring us from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>MRS. NOTABLE, an old widow couſin of my own, is the very quinteſcence of modern politeneſs and good nature; once every Chriſtmas I have the honour of an invitation among a great number of other relations, and then have a perfect opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of contemplating the elaborate eaſe of this obliging gentlewoman; the moment we enter, ſhe makes it a particular rule to enquire after the health of the whole company, and the inſtant we are ſeated, comes regularly round to every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and demands a circumſtantial account of the minuteſt occurrence ſince ſhe had laſt the happineſs of ſeeing us: if any one by accident has laboured under a ſlight cold, all the recipes in the complete houſewife are thundered about our ears, and an infinity of lamentations poured out for ſo irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a misfortune. Unhappily indeed, at our laſt meeting none of us had the leaſt complaint to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I found was a mortification of no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0136400201:149"/>
trifling kind to my couſin; however ſhe would not be robbed of an opportunity of ſhewing both her knowledge and politeneſs, and therefore intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her favourite topic with the greateſt facility, good naturedly lamenting a ſecond time for a ſore throat which my ſiſter Rattle had been laid up with the preceding twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>BUT if this preparatory account of Mrs. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table's politeneſs, has given the reader a high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her character, what will he ſay, when I carry him through the ceremony of dinner, and touch upon the unremitting ſollicitude which ſhe manifeſts for the accommodation of the company: notwithſtanding her table is generally as well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as any woman's in the kingdom, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe does not a little pique herſelf upon the elegance of this annual entertainment, yet the moment it is brought up, we have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand excuſes made for the poverty of our dinner. — Well! lord! I don't believe you can touch a bit on't— but you are ſo good — though I wonder how you come a ſecond time to a place ſo utterly unprovided! — this we underſtand as a proper cue to praiſe every thing before us, and then are obliged to ſtand a whole volley of encomiums on our extraordinary goodneſs, till at laſt, when we have in a manner half burſt ourſelves, and are told how very little we have eat; a freſh concern for the badneſs of our entertainment concludes the feaſt, and relieves us a little from the fatigue of ſuch extraordinary politeneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0136400201:150"/>How widely different is the conduct of Sir Harry Downright? — From an utter averſion to ceremony, he becomes actually the rudeſt fellow alive, and when he borders upon a brutality of behaviour, calls it an eaſineſs ariſing from good-nature and friendly familiarity. In the company of the ladies he ſits conſtantly covered, never helps a ſoul at his own table, though he has an abſolute ſtranger at dinner; nor ever makes any ſcruple to tell a woman ſhe lies, in plain Engliſh: as Sir Harry would not be thought a coxcomb for the univerſe, he carefully avoids the ſmalleſt indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that character in his appearance; he ſeldom ſhaves above once a week, ſcarcely ever combs his hair, chews an enormous quantity of tobacco, and makes a point of going into well dreſt companies with a dirty ſhirt: upon the whole, to eſcape the imputation of ceremonious, he becomes in all places offenſive, and for fear of deviating into an effeminate puppy, as he calls it, he throws off all pretenſion to decency, and ſinks into an abſolute brute.</p>
               <p>THE extremes of behaviour are what every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſenſe ſhould cautiouſly ſtudy to avoid, ſince an exceſs of ceremony cannot fail of ſubjecting us to ridicule, and a total riſregard of politeneſs muſt naturally expoſe us to contempt: difficult however as the proper ſyſtem of conduct may appear, I ſhall be bold enough to lay down one rule, which will, in my opinion, intirely comprize it, and ſerve as a juſt concluſion to the preſent paper: In all
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0136400201:151"/>
companies let a man endeavour to pleaſe, rather than expect to be pleaſed, and if this does not gain him many friends, I ſhall not ſcruple to affirm, that it will never procure him a ſingle enemy.</p>

               <p>FILIAL piety is a flower of ſo delicate a nature, that we meet but very few places which can produce it; and though we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear of parents who ruin themſelves for the ſake of their children, yet, we ſeldom or ever hear of children who do any extraordinary acts of kindneſs to their parents. — Perhaps na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has formed the parental ſenſibility, infinitely more exquiſite than the filial, and, for ſome wiſe purpoſe, implanted a much greater fondneſs on our minds for thoſe we beget and educate, than for thoſe by whom we are begotten and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ourſelves; at leaſt cuſtom has firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſuch different ſentiments relative to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of parent and child, that it is thought a matter of the higheſt praiſe in a wealthy ſon to ſettle a paltry fifty pound for life on a diſtreſſed and worthy father; but an action of little or no merit in a father to ſettle twenty times the ſum upon an indigent ſon. I ſupped laſt night at my ſiſter Rattle's, where I generally hear ſomething new, and was entertained by my nephew Harry,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0136400201:152"/>
with the following exception to the foregoing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which I flatter myſelf will prove no diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable relation to my readers.</p>
               <p>AN eminent merchant, whoſe name I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conceal under that of Webley, married a moſt amiable woman, with whom he received a conſiderable fortune, and by whom he was bleſt in the firſt year with a daughter, called Maria: Mrs. Webley however unhappily catching a cold during the time of her lying-in, did not long ſurvive the birth of her child, but died in about three months after; with her laſt breath conjuring her huſband to be particularly attentive to the welfare of the unfortunate little Maria.</p>
               <p>MR. WEBLEY for two years before his marriage had been connected with a ſubtle deſigning woman, by whom he alſo had a daughter, nor did his having a wife put an end to the guilty intercourſe: under pretence of important buſineſs, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtaid in town with her a night or two in the week, while Mrs. Webley was down at the country houſe in Hertfordſhire; and as frequently carried her into the country with him, whenever he knew his lady could not conveniently leave town: — His marriage, in fact, was rather an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intereſt, than a union of inclination; and Mrs. Webley's fortune enabling him to live up to the ſummit of his wiſhes, the moment ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, he thought there was no farther neceſſity for reſtraint or diſguiſe. — In ſhort, ſix weeks had ſcarcely elapſed, when he married the abandoned
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0136400201:153"/>
woman we have been ſpeaking of, and pitched upon the moſt profligate of her ſex, to ſupply the place of the very beſt.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall paſs over the time of Maria's infancy, when ſhe experienced little more than the dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cruelty of a narrow-minded mother in-law, and come at once to that period, which may be juſtly reckoned the moſt important of her life: ſhe had juſt entered on her eighteenth year, and was blooming into all the perfections of her ſex, when Mrs. Webley began to think of executing a ſcheme which ſhe had long in agitation. — She ſaw Maria treated by every body with the greateſt reſpect, and beheld her own daughter, though dreſt out in all the faſhionable foppery of the times, and infinitely more attended to, received with a degree of inſipid civility, that bordered upon contempt. — The ſhameful neglect which Maria experienced at home, gave a conſtant luſtre to her merit when abroad, and if ſhe found no kind of countenance in her own family, ſhe met with the higheſt in every other place. — This was a circumſtance which galled Mrs. Webley to the very ſoul, and being more over fearful that the regard ſo univerſally ſhewn to Maria, would be a means of obſtructing any favourable addreſſes which might be made to her own daughter, ſhe took a ſpeedy opportunity of quarrelling with that unhappy young lady, and being, as the generality of thoſe of her principles moſt commonly are, both maſter and miſtreſs of the houſe, very fairly turned her out of doors,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0136400201:154"/>
— Maria was not however deſtitute of a protector, though ſhe had loſt a father. — A young fellow, with a good underſtanding and a ſplendid eſtate, who had long ſolicited her favourable opinion, and gained it, took that opportunity of preſſing for her hand, and was made the happieſt of men.</p>
               <p>MARIA was married about five years, during which time, though ſhe had often entreated for a reconciliation, ſhe never could be admitted to the preſence of her father; when, taking up the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, one Saturday evening, ſhe met with his name amongſt the liſt of bankrupts, and inſtantly fainted on the floor: ſhe was however ſoon brought to herſelf, when, forgetting in a moment how ſhe had been turned out upon the charity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable world, and expoſed to the moſt pinching poverty and diſgrace; how for a ſeries of years ſhe had been treated as an alien to her father's family, and even denied the moſt trivial neceſſaries, while ſtrangers were riotting on her mother's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; ſhe flew to her huſband, whoſe happineſs was centred in obliging her, and painting out the miſerable ſituation of her father, obtained his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſettle three hundred a year out of a ſum which he would allow her for pin money on him, to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate ſo diſtreſſing an incident: with this ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took coach, and proceeded to her father's; the door was now thrown open at her approach; and being introduced to the old gentleman's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they gazed upon one another for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then burſt into a mutual flood of tears.</p>

Suffice it, however, that after his affairs were ſettled, he retired into the country, upon this yearly allowance, but did not live long enough to enjoy the firſt quarter: the mortification of being a bankrupt, the conſciouſneſs of his family errors, and finally, the very generoſity of his daughter, which was intended to ſweeten the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his life, proved a means of hurrying him to his end: the agitation of his mind threw the gout in his ſtomach, and he died in Maria's arms, in the fiftieth year of his age. His wife and daughter now thought themſelves utterly undone; but Maria, with a greatneſs of mind peculiar to herſelf, in an inſtant diſpelled their apprehenſions by a continuation of two hundred a year, during her life, and without ever ſtooping to hint any thing of their former behaviour, told them, that

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM a conſtant reader of your productions, and have conceived ſuch an opinion of your regard for the poor women, that I am reſolved to trouble you with an account of my ſituation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it is poſſible that ſeveral of my ſex are labouring under the ſame anxieties, and that this letter may be productive of ſome happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to them, however it may fail in being any way advantageous to me.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know, Sir, that about three years ago I was married to a man of diſtinguiſhed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as well as conſiderable fortune; and therefore looked upon by all my friends to be very happily ſettled for life. — My huſband's known good ſenſe, Sir, and the affluence of his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were conſidered by every body, as indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſecurities for my felicity, and there was ſcarcely a young lady of my acquaintance who did not envy me ſo favourable a match.</p>
                  <p>I HAD not however been married above a month, Sir, before I found, myſelf treated with a palpable
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0136400201:157"/>
indifference, and cut off from all thoſe rational enjoyments which I flattered myſelf with poſſeſſing in the continual ſociety of ſo ſenſible a huſband. — Inſtead of entertaining me as he was formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, with inſtructive relations of men and things, he grew ſilent and reſerved, and inſtead of the continual vivacity with which his looks had before been animated, nothing now appeared upon his brow but a ſettled air of the moſt perfect diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, or a ſupercilious ſmile of centempt. — I was for a long time at a loſs to account for ſo ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an alteration of temper, and you may be ſure, as I paſſionately loved Mr. Highmore, ſuch a change muſt have given me many an uneaſy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, particularly as I ſtudied, with all poſſible care, to keep my anxiety concealed. — It was a mortifying circumſtance, Mr. Babler, if I aſked a tender queſtion, to be anſwered with a blunt <hi>yes,</hi> or <hi>no</hi>; to be told I teized him, if I enquired after his health; and to have my hand toſt away with an ill-natured 'pſhaw, if I preſumed to take hold of his, or attempted to regulate any little article of his dreſs. — At laſt, Sir, the myſtery was unravelled, I overheard him one day talking to an intimate friend of his about the follies of the fair ſex, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that the very beſt were a moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pack of creatures, much below the notice of a man of underſtanding; — <q>for my part, (ſays he) I ſuppoſe myſelf as happily married as any body of my acquaintance, but ſtill a wife is no more than a woman; and as ſuch, though a neceſſary
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0136400201:158"/>
animal, ſhe is conſequently below the regard of a man of common ſpeculation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>HAVING thus diſcovered the occaſion of Mr. Highmore's indifference, I reſolved to render my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as worthy of his attention as I could, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing on the moſt important ſubjects I was able: for this purpoſe I would occaſionly cite a paſſage from our celebrated writers, and deliver my opinion on hiſtorical events, poetical compoſition, and ſuch other parts of literature as I thought would be moſt agreeable to the temper I ſaw him in. — But alas, Sir, inſtead of finding his humour abated by this ſolicitude to pleaſe, I had the misfortune to ſee it viſibly encreaſed: — If I quoted a paſſage from any author, he ſmiled; — If I pretended to judge, he tittered — But if I was inſolent enough to differ from the minuteſt opinion of his, he either flew out of the houſe, or politely laughed in my face. — Every caſual impropriety of accent he was ſure to ridicule, and thoſe little grammatical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracies which women cannot always avoid, were everlaſting object of contempt. — Failing in my endeavours here, I attempted to engage him in a variety of amuſements, but in vain — If I propoſed the play — women only diverted his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from the buſineſs of the performance; — If I propoſed a walk in the park — women truly were pretty companions to dangle with in public: — If I mentioned a game at cards, fools only had recourſe to diverſions of that kind.— In ſhort, Sir, let me ſtart what I would, either the meanneſs of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0136400201:159"/>
or the greatneſs of his own, was ſure of defeating all my views, and nothing was happy enough to merit his approbation but what imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately proceeded from himſelf. — For this laſt twelvemonth, Sir, Mr. Highmore has commenced <hi>bon vivant</hi> and ſat till three or four o'clock every morning with a ſelect party of friends, who are eminent in the world for their literary abilities; as it is a fundamental principle with theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gentlemen, never to part, while they are able to ſit together. Irregularity and intemperance have ſo impaired the conſtitution of my poor Mr. Highmore, that I am terrified to death at the bare ſuppoſition of the conſequences. — His employment all day is to recover from the exceſſes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening, and his buſineſs all night to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide an indiſpoſition for the next day.</p>
                  <p>FOR God's ſake, Mr. Babler, ſay ſomething about thoſe men of ſenſe who look upon women to be idiots, and yet are guilty of actions that would make the meaneſt of us aſhamed. — Is this ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of underſtanding, Sir, upon which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of your ſex ſo highly pique themſelves, to be pleaded as an eternal excuſe for indiſcretions and errors, and no allowance to be made for the little failings of the poor women, though we are treated continually as fools?</p>
                  <p>I COULD ſay a great deal, Sir, on this ſubject, but fearing to treſpaſs too much upon your leiſure, I ſhall take my leave,</p>

                  <p>SINGULARITY is ſo much the affectation of the preſent Aera, that there is ſcarely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual but what ſtrikes out a plan of operation for himſelf, and exhibits a particular ſomething in his character, that marks him in a diſtinct manner from every body elſe. This endeavour at ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, let the circumſtance be what it will, in which we diſplay it, is always the reſult of much pride, and little underſtanding; it proceeds from a deſpicable ambition to be talked of, and, like the Epheſian youth, ſo we hear our name bandied about from mouth to mouth, it becomes a matter of indifference how we are mentioned, whether for erecting a temple to the Deity, or for ſetting one in flames.</p>
                  <p>AMONG many inſtances which I have remarked of ſubaltern ſingularity in the courſe of my own acquaintance, the foundation of poor Ned Totter's fame is one of the moſt extraordinary. Ned, for theſe laſt twenty years, has not touched a morſel of butcher's meat, his diet conſiſting chiefly of fiſh, fowl, and vegetables, and this bare circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance has been a conſtant ſource of ſelf-exultation ever ſince: when he comes into company he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0136400201:161"/>
watches for every opportunity of relating this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious acts of abſtinence, and is particularly pleaſed if any ſtrangers happen to be preſent to bleſs him with a ſtare of aſtoniſhment, which he looks upon as the higheſt indication of applauſe. I have frequently known him run about from coffee-houſe to coffee-houſe, in order to meet with a freſh admirer, and engage a whole table of politicians with a diſcourſe upon the pecullarities of all the crowned heads in Europe, that he might turn the converſation of his auditory at laſt upon the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own. A very ſenſible young fellow, who has ſtudied his ruling paſſion, takes every occaſion of indulging it, and leads him with a preparatory diſcourſe to a conſtant mention of his favourite ſubject; this has made the young fellow ſo extremely agreeable to my old friend, that upon a fit of illneſs ſometime ago, he ſet him down very handſomely in his will, and appointed him one of his executors. Various are the circumſtances I could tell of this affected ſingularity. — Tom Steady has made it a point every day ſince the laſt rebellion, to take a view of Temple-bar, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf with a ſight of the heads. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary mark of his affection for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has anſwered his wiſhes; it has been talked of a thouſand times among his acquaintance, and Tom is at once the trueſt ſubject, and the happieſt man, in the kingdom. — Frank Loiter has rendered himſelf immortal for lounging about Weſtminſter-hall during term time. — Will Careleſs is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0136400201:162"/>
celebrated for having his ſtockings hanging continually about his heels; and my ingenious friend, Mr. Thomas Clough, of Drury-lane Theatre, is talked of by all the world for never miſſing an execution at Tyburn.</p>
                  <p>BUT if ſingularity in trivial occurrences is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of making us ridiculous, an affection of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vices, through a deſire of appearing ſingular, cannot ſurely ſail of rendering us odious, as well as deſpicable in the eyes of the world, and occaſion every rational perſon to view us with abhorrence, as well as contempt; yet notwithſtanding the conſequences are ſo evident and poſitive, what numbers do we not continually obſerve eſtabliſhing their character upon a foundation like this? What myriads does not every day's experience point out, who are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be thought raſcals as well as fools, and ſeek the public admiration in ſome ſingularity of behaviour for which they ought to be hanged?</p>
                  <p>OF this number is that celebrated libertine, Sir Charles Riot. Sir Charles is poſſeſſed of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome figure, an extenſive underſtanding, and a plentiful eſtate; yet, with all theſe advantages to gain an honeſt reputation, his whole ſtudy is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a character from the deſtruction of every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he is admitted in; and his only ambition to become conſpicuous from the number and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his crimes. In one houſe he has ruined two ſiſters, the daughters of a moſt intimate friend: In another he has debauched the wife of a man, to whom he is indebted for no leſs than his life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0136400201:163"/>THE actions are univerſally ſpoken of, but ſo far from being aſhamed, our hopeful baronet thinks the mention of them a compliment to his perſonal qualifications, and always makes gallantry the ſubject of his converſation, that ſomebody may take notice of the laurels he has won in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive field of real infamy, and imaginary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
                  <p>SINGULARITY, Mr. Babler, unfortunate for us, is to be met with in every thing but the virtues, and theſe being ſo very rare to be met with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to talk of it further than as it concerns our follies and our vices, would be unneceſſary; for which reaſon I ſhall drop the ſubject here, and ſtile myſelf,</p>

                  <p>BREAKFAST was no ſooner over Whit-Monday, than my maid Hannah came up ſtairs and begged leave to paſs the remainder of the day with ſome relations of her's, who had made a party for Fulham. — As the girl was a very good ſervant, I not only granted the requeſt, but made her a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of half a crown towards defraying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the excurſion — ſhe thanked me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to return early in the evening, and ſet out.— About nine o'clock I expexted her home, but no Hannah came Mr. Babler — Ten ſtruck, and ſtill there was no ſign of her appearance — Eleven ſtruck, but no Hannah, Sir; I can't ſay but I was terrified, leaſt ſome accident ſhould have happened
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0136400201:165"/>
to the poor girl, and therefore ſent my Tom with the other maid Nanny, to her ſiſter's, a diſcreet, ſober, ſort of a young woman, who keeps a chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's ſhop within two or three ſtreets: all that this produced was new uneaſineſs — the ſiſter knew nothing of her; heard of no party ſhe was engaged in, and ſeemed to be frighted out of her wits. — On this report, I went to bed, but deſired Nanny to wait up till twelve o'clock: ſhe did, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o no purpoſe — Hannah never came near the houſe ſince Sir; and we have lately diſcovered, that ſhe went out with a footman belonging to an officer, that day inſtead of going with any relations; that ſhe dined with this ſorry fellow at Chelſea, where, after dinner, he perſuaded her to drink a glaſs or two of punoh, which had ſuch an effect upon her, being utterly unuſed to ſtrong liquors, as rendered it abſolutely neceſſary for her to be put to bed. No doubt, the whole was a deſign of the artful villain's; for ſhe was no ſooner under the blankets than he ſtept without any ceremony into bed too; and deſtroyed in one moment that repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which the unhappy creature had preſerved unſuſpected for a whole life: when ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the uſe of her reaſon, ſhame and diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevented her from coming home; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worſt that could, had now happened, ſhe retired with her betrayer to a little room in a hedge alehouſe, where ſhe continued with him ever ſince; refuſing either to ſee her ſiſter, or return to her place, though I ſent her word I ſhould take her

back again, if ſhe left the villain, and would give an abſolute promiſe never to have any intercourſe with him for the future.</p>
                  <p>SUCH, Mr. Babler, is the conſequence of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-making; and now ſuffer an old woman to make two or three curſory remarks — I remember my firſt huſband, and as honeſt a man he was as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed, Sir, I am perfectly of opinion with Mr. Robinſon; holidays were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inſtituted to inſpire a ſolemn ſenſe of religious duties, and to give thoſe a favourable opportunity of proſecuting their devotions at particular ſeaſons, whoſe neceſſary avocations might prevent them from ſo conſtant an attendance as they might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wiſh at other times; but let me aſk, Sir, if the end of the church is anſwered in the leaſt? Do our young people go to church on holidays? Alas, Sir, they conſider a holiday as an abſolute exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from every concern of a religious kind; and a ſort of licence to indulge every depravity of their ſentiments! Do our old people go to church on holidays? Very few Sir; they are employed in cards and feſtivity; and ſo far is the verge of that eternity, upon which they totter, from making any ſalutary impreſſions on their minds, that though I have not miſſed church a ſingle day theſe thirty years, yet at the three grand feſtivals, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0136400201:167"/>
it to be worſe attended than at any other ſeaſon in the year; a few ſuperannuated women, like myſelf, have compoſed the whole congregation, and even the clergyman has run over the ſervice in ſuch a prepoſterous hurry, that I have often thought he was impatient to mix in the cuſtomary riots of his pariſhoners.</p>
                  <p>SEEING, therefore, Mr. Babler, that holidays, ſo far from anſwering, rather defeat the purpoſes of religion, and knowing alſo how deſtructive they are to the community, by encouraging a ſhameful idleneſs among all ranks of people, (the lower order particularly, whoſe families muſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſufferers by the ſmalleſt neglect, I think that every conſideration, both divine and human, ſhould induce us to lay them aſide, ſince nothing can be more ſcandalous than to ſet a ſeaſon apart for the ſupport both of idleneſs and irreligion; and nothing more repugnant to wiſdom or virtue, than to ſanctify, as one may ſay, a time for prejudicing the fortunes, and corrupting the morals of the people.</p>

               <p>AN exceſs of ſenſibility, though nothing can be more amiable than a feeling heart, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one the greateſt misfortunes which the human mind can labour under, becauſe there is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſource of objects to intereſt it's tenderneſs, and a conſtant round of accidents to work upon it's fears. — Happily indeed, we are not overſtocked with people who poſſeſs this quality to any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary degree, but the few who do, might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for their own ſakes, as well as the happineſs of others, be much better, if they were endued with no ſenſibility at all.</p>

repetitions of penury and want: fraud was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually peſtering him with letters of ſupplication, and the looſeſt proſtitutes of the town, teazed his ears forever with imaginary amendments and artificial diſtreſs; his hand was ſtill open to all, and though his friends very frequently remonſtrated on the injudicious diſtribution of his fortune, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was eternally, that he could not bear to ſee any boſom ſwelled with affliction, nor any eye reddening with wretchedneſs and deſpair: in leſs than ten years however, his eſtate was reduced to a fifteenth part of its worth; the great decay of his own cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, now obliged him to be leſs attentive to the affairs of other people, and ſeeing that nothing but beggary was before him if he went on much farther, he bound himſelf under a large penalty never to give away above a tenth part of the pitiful little hundred a year which was left: this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſpoſes of in halfpence and pence to the common beggars, and the moment it is expended, locks himſelf up in his room, to avoid both the ſight and the importunity of theſe vagrant mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, till the receipt of his next year's ſupply.</p>
               <p>LADY Catherine Nettleworth, is another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of exceſſive ſenſibily, but it is however, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely confined to her children, and her lap-dogs; if one of the young gentlemen goes abroad, ſhe is under the moſt violent agitation, leſt ſome accident ſhould happen in the ſhorteſt excurſion; if he goes in the coach, ſhe is in a continual uneaſneſs, for fear it ſhould overſet; if he rides, her apprehenſion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0136400201:170"/>
is equally alive, leſt the horſe ſhould unhappily take fright; if he walks, ſhe dreads the conſequence of the fatigue, and let the day be either wet or dry, ſhe trembles alike with a terror of his catching cold, or being parched to death with the ſun: in order to quiet herſelf in all theſe different reſpects, ſhe ſometimes keeps the young gentlemen within doors for a whole week; but then ſhe is miſerable in the other extreme; ſhe ſickens, leſt they ſhould ſuffer for want of exerciſe, and dies, for fear they ſhould be ſtifled for want of air; at table, if they eat hearty, ſhe dreads their being ſurfeited, and is wretched from a ſuppoſition of being indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, if they do not: in fact, whatever they do ſhe ſeldom has a moment's peace for thinking about their welfare; and wherever ſhe goes, rarely ſuffers any body elſe to enjoy a moment's ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for talking about their various accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>HER concern for her lap-dogs is no leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than her ſolicitude about her children; if the maid neglects to comb them twice a day, ſhe flies into the vapours; or ſuffers them to go into a damp room, ſhe falls into fits; in ſhort, there is ſcarcely a circumſtance in which her ſenſibility is not creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a new ſource of diſquiets, nor a friend in the world whom ſhe does not render unhappy with her endleſs apprehenſions and complaints. Upon the whole, I may with certainty enough conclude this paper as I ſet out, with affirming, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of ſenſibility (amiable ſoever as it is to have a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0136400201:171"/>
feeling heart) is productive of ſo many uneaſineſſes to ourſelves, and ſo many inquietudes to our friends, that it would in reality be much better for thoſe who labour under it, to be unacquainted with the finer feelings, and to have little or no ſenſibility at all.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM a plain young fellow near the Monument, and have been courting a moſt agreeable girl in the neighbourhood for above ſix months; but what ſurprizes me is, that though ſhe receives the viſits of no other ſuitor as I can diſcover, and is generally upon ſome little party of pleaſure with myſelf, I can by no means bring her to a candid declaration of her ſentiments, nor find out whether or no ſhe deſigns me for a huſband. — Every queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has a tendency to explain matters, ſhe avoids with the greateſt addreſs and flies out into a violent paſſion if I preſs it with any degree of earneſtneſs or importunity.</p>
                  <p>ALL this time, Sir, I am ſpending my money, loſing my time, and neglecting my buſineſs: — I have been obliged to 'ſquire her to Vauxhall or Ranelagh two or three times a week, and becauſe I would do matters genteely, have kept the coach in waiting at each of thoſe places the whole even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0136400201:172"/>
this and the other neceſſary expences, bear a little heavy on the pocket of a tradeſman, Mr. Babler, who has no ambition to appear in the London Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, though accompanied or uſhered in with the truly reſpectable name of Robert Earl of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington.</p>
                  <p>WHEN I firſt commenced an humble ſervant of my adorable's, I thought it abundantly ſufficient to propoſe a walk in the Park, or a diſh of tea at the White-Conduit-Houſe, and imagined a prudent conſideration for the main chance, would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to her good opinion, eſpecially as ſhe had but a very ſmall fortune of her own, and knew upon that account, the neceſſity there was for a little oeconomy. — But, lack-a-day, Sir, the White-Conduit-Houſe was reſorted by nothing but Barbers' boys, or Mantuamakers' apprentices; and for a walk in the Park, ſhe never could be able to crawl ſo far — ſhe hated draggling through the ſtreets, and could not bear to be toſt about at the diſcretion of every clumſy porter, or odious Iriſh chairman. — This was a broad hint; and therefore hoping to bring her to an immediate compliance by the appearance of generoſity, I gave into her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and coached it about ſo unceaſingly, that ſhe now looks upon it as an indiſpenſible compliment which I am obliged to pay, and never ſtirs without a carriage out of doors. — This is not all, Mr. Babler; ſhe has lately got a knack of ſtopping at goldſmiths ſhops, and at milliners of her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance — there ſhe has fallen in love with a variety of little knick-knacks, which, like a blockhead, I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0136400201:173"/>
have fooliſhly complimented her with, and no later than laſt week, Sir, it coſt me ſixteen guineas for a diamond hoop ring, and five for ſome little paltry article in her head dreſs.</p>
                  <p>THESE expences, and the uncertainty I am in with reſpect to her inclinations, have made me very ſerious, Sir; for though I love her with the utmoſt ſincerity, and would marry her to-morrow, without a ſix-pence, ſtill I muſt have ſome regard for myſelf too, and prevent in time the deſtruction of my little fortune, and the laughter of the world into the bargain. I have therefore taken the liberty, Sir, of troubling you with a few queſtions, by the advice of my friend Tom Watkinſon, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly takes in your entertaining paper, and ſpeaks in the handſomeſt manner of your good-nature and abilities.</p>
                  <p>BE ſo good then to tell me, if it is not very cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in any woman who intends to marry an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer, to drive him on expences conſiderably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what ſhe knows can be afforded by his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances?</p>
                  <p>ANS. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Q. Is it not to the laſt degree ſcandalous for a woman, if ſhe does not intend to marry an admirer, to ſaddle him with continual parties of pleaſure, and to receive preſents of value from him at every opportunity?</p>
                  <p>A. Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0136400201:174"/>Q. Is not the woman who does the firſt, a wife utterly improper for any man that has a fortune to loſe?</p>
                  <p>A. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Q. And is not the woman who does the ſecond, a wife too deſpicable for any man at all?</p>
                  <p>A. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Q. Would you adviſe me at the next interview with my goddeſs, in ſpite of every frown of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain or toſs of reſentment, to demand a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory anſwer whether ſhe is willing to have me or no?</p>
                  <p>A. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Q. If ſhe ſhould happen to conſent, would you adviſe me to marry her?</p>
                  <p>A. This queſtion is uſeleſs, being ſufficiently anſwered by the firſt and third queries.</p>
                  <p>Q. Would you marry a woman yourſelf, Mr. Babler, who had acted like my adorable?</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM an unhappy poor raſcal, and have, to my unſpeakable mortification, been married theſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0136400201:175"/>
three years, to a woman of extraordinary piety and virtue. — Don't be ſurpriſed — I am neither angry with her piety, nor offended with her virtue; on the contrary, I revere her for both the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but they are attended with conſequences ſo vary diſagreeable, that I frequently wiſh, when provoked beyond all bounds, that ſhe had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to Billingſgate or Bow-ſtreet for the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her education.</p>
                  <p>I AM, you muſt know, Sir, a Haberdaſher, juſt ſet up at the polite end of the town, where with a little induſtry, I have a very reaſonable proſpect of making a pretty tolerable fortune. — I am very aſſiduous in buſineſs myſelf, and wiſh I could ſay as much for my wife. — But lackaday, inſtead of minding the duties of the ſhop when I am trotting up and down with a parcel of goods, her ladyſhip runs out to her devotions, to ſome neighbouring church or chapel, and truſts the care of every thing to an ignorant apprentice, or a giddy headed journey woman. What is worſe, upon theſe occaſions, Sir, her ſanctity renders her commonly as croſs as the very devil, and if I ſay a ſingle ſyllable, I am ſure to hear a volley of charitable ejaculations for the welfare of my poor ſoul, and to be treated the remainder of the whole day like a downright re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</p>
                  <p>YOU would imagine however, Sir, that when ſhe does come home, ſhe might be kind enough to favour me with a little of her aſſiſtance, and to caſt an eye over the regulation of my family. —
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0136400201:176"/>
Far different is the caſe; the moment ſhe comes in, ſhe retires to her room, and there waſtes away the time till dinner, over ſome ſtupid compilation of enthuſiaſtic prayers, or ſome ignorant rhapſody made uſe of at her conventicles; there profoundly wrapt in dirt and meditation, ſhe imagines herſelf diſcharging the great employment of her life, and never caſts a ſingle thought upon the miſerable poor dog her huſband, or the unhappy little wretches her children.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE ſpoke of her, Mr. Babler, as being wrapt up in dirt and meditation. — I ſaid no more than the truth; for the filthineſs of her perſon is equal to the piety of her ſentiments. — Looking down with diſdain upon every ſublunary enjoyment, ſhe thinks it beneath her to pay the leaſt attention to her dreſs, and upon this decent principle it is, that hardly once in three months ſhe puts on either a clean cap, or a light-coloured apron. — A ruſty old cardinal ſerves her for a coverſlut, as often as ſhe goes out; and as for her appearance at home, ſhe kindly imagines that any thing is good enough to wear before her huſband; nay, Sir, ſometimes ſhe won't waſh her hands or face in a whole fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and you ſhall judge what a condition her arms were in upon one of theſe occaſions, when a ſurgeon in the neighbourhood who came to bleed her, miſtook the dirt for an antiquated kidſkin, and deſired ſhe would take off her gloves.</p>
                  <p>FROM the preceding little ſketch of my amiable helpmate, Mr. Babler, you muſt judge that her
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0136400201:177"/>
conduct has as great an effect upon my mind as an impreſſion on my circumſtances, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that I am never eaſy without being abroad, though I know the abſolute neceſſity for my attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at home upon buſineſs. — I am cut off in my own houſe from every little comfort of ſociety, and of courſe muſt have an inclination of ſeeking it ſomewhere elſe. — I cannot aſk a friend to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, dine, or ſup with me. My own ſtomach is conſtantly turned when I ſit down to table, and that I think abundantly ſufficient, without ſtriving to diſguſt my acquaintance. — Beſides, from an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neglect of the moſt domeſtic concern, let me ſay what I will, I can never get a joint of meat properly dreſſed, but have it brought up without being heated half through, or elſe intirely done to rags.</p>
                  <p>THUS ſituated, as I ſaid before, I take every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of going abroad, and this opens a freſh ſource of inconvenience and anxiety. — My wife, to crown my misfortunes, is uncommonly fond of me, and if I either dine or ſup from home, is ſure of being conſtantly in tears. — Yet, Sir, this home ſhe makes intolerable, for even after ſhop hours, if I oblige her by ſtaying within, I meet freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of mortification. — Mirth and good humour are baniſhed from my doors; a harmleſs joke is conſidered as a ſinful levity, and an innocent laugh, prohibited as wholly antichriſtian. The caſe is not mended neither, if in conformity to her humour, I wear a grave aſpect; for then, Sir, ſhe either
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0136400201:178"/>
teazes me to death with unneceſſary apprehenſions about my health, or reproaches me with being ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured, becauſe I am confined to her company. Any way ſhe is ſure of finding fault, and any way I am equally certain of being rendered miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Is there no means, Mr. Babler, of curing this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable malady of being righteous overmuch? Is there no means of convincing theſe narrow minded women, that a moroſeneſs of temper, or a diſregard of rational enjoyments, are in no manner encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the ſentiments of religion; but that on the contrary, a ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcharge the neceſſary duties of wife and mother, are particularly ſome of it's moſt beautiful characteriſtics. — I do not think this ſubject would be unworthy the pen of our moſt eminent divines. — Suffer me, through your paper, to beg ſome of them will conſider it, ſince it is more likely that a leſſon on this matter will come with more weight from the pulpit than any other quarter.</p>

               <p>THE impreſſions which are made upon the human mind, during its earlieſt ſtates, being ſeldom if ever to be entirely eradicated, there is nothing in which we ought to be more careful
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0136400201:179"/>
than the education of our children, particularly in their infancy, when habits in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the term, become an abſolute part of our nature, and prejudices not only find a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uge in the heart; but twiſt themſelves imperceptibly round it's very ſtrings.</p>
               <p>I REMEMBER when I was about four or five years of age, my grandmother took me entirely under her own care, and as the good woman, like the generality of her ſex at that period, had a firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in witches, ſpirits, and hobgobblins, ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently entertained me with a variety of their pretty performances, and if I happened to be any ways untoward, conſtantly threatened to ſend me to Robin Greenway — This Mr. Robin Greenway was formerly a journeyman taylor in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who had gone diſtracted for love, as the people ſaid, and in one of his deſperate fits, cut his throat in the parſon's garden. — Various were the tricks related of this unhappy enamorato; ſometimes he came in a ſtorm, and threw a parcel of bricks down his ſweetheart's chimney; at other times he aſſumed the figure of a grey mare; and at others, that of a ſpotted ſpaniel, but his moſt favourite mode of appearance, was the form of an overgrown calf. — Ridiculous as theſe accounts muſt have been inevitably conſidered on the ſmalleſt reflexion, yet my poor grandmother believed them all with the moſt religious certainty, and thought it an indiſpenſible part of her duty to make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them too. — In this ſhe ſucceeded to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0136400201:180"/>
moſt of her wiſhes; I was ten years old before I would venture to ſleep alone; fourteen, before I had courage enough to go to bed in the dark, and to this very hour, if I happen to be by myſelf, the clock never ſtrikes twelve at night, but I think of Robin Greenway, or ſome other worſhipful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame community, to whom the bleſſing of an untimely death has granted a privilege of taking what form, and playing what tricks, he pleaſes till the cock crows next morning.</p>
               <p>IT would be unneceſſary for me to obſerve, that nine out of every ten, who may be turned of fifty, have, like myſelf, in their infancy, been trained up in the greateſt dread of ſpirits; and that the utmoſt exertion of their reaſon upon arriving at years of maturity, has not been ſufficient to eraſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which have then been unhappily made upon their imagination. — Fortunately however, the good ſenſe of the preſent Era has provided the moſt effectual ſpells for our ghoſts and ſpectres, and laid ſo many of them ſucceſsfully in the red ſea, that harmleſs little boys may for the future ſleep in the moſt perfect ſecurity, and the honeſt country people traverſe the remoteſt church yard after midnight, without the ſmalleſt apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding we have in a great meaſure got the better of our ghoſts, there are yet ſome prejudices, and thoſe of a very dangerous tendency, which we have in a manner ſubſtituted in their room, and which it would be much to our honour in this life, and to our happineſs in the next, if we
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0136400201:181"/>
could get the better of too. — Theſe are the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indulgencies to which we think ourſelves enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on Sundays. — In the days of ſpectres and hobgobblins, we thought ourſelves under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible neceſſity of paying ſome regard to the ſabbath, and every man was obliged to pay a fine who omitted going to church that day, unleſs he could palliate his conduct by ſome very feaſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; but now-a-days, Sunday is the time particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet apart for riot and feſtivity, and the day rendered holy by the expreſs appointment of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, the day peculiarly appropriated for the greateſt violation of it's laws. — Has a great man a journey to make, or a company to invite, Sunday is an idle day, and he ſixes either upon that. — Has a woman of faſhion an inclination to ſtrip her beſt friends of the money which ought to pay a tradeſman's bill, ſhe ſends cards for Sunday evening. — And has a petty little mechanic a mind to cut a figure, why he hires his horſe, takes out his ſtrumpet, and gets drunk on Sunday evening too.</p>
               <p>IN the inferior orders of life, there is a notion generally prevalent, that cards are very monſtrous on a Sunday, and there are many well-meaning people who would not upon any conſideration ſit down to a party of whiſt. — None of my readers will imagine, I dare ſay, that I want from this to extenuate the infamous cuſtom of card-playing on the ſabbath of God. — All that I want is, to ſhew the lower claſſes of the people, that leaping in the fields, playing at cricket, riding horſe matches
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0136400201:182"/>
on the roads, and getting drunk on that day, is every whit as criminal as the propenſity to cards, which they ſo highly cenſure in their ſuperiors; that any of thoſe exerciſes which they think allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is rather more indecent, becauſe more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly practiſed, and may in reality be attended with infinitely worſe effects. — Let them therefore (if it be in vain to preach to the politer world) firſt of all reform in theſe points of behaviour on Sundays, themſelves, before they pretend to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign the conduct of the great; and inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the mote in the eye of their neighbour, ſit attentively down to pluck the beam out of their own.</p>

whiſper it to the very winds, but a juſt concern for the happineſs of others, has worked upon my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and wrings the melancholy ſecret from my heart. — You muſt know, Mr. Babler, I am a woman of ſome birth, had once a little beauty, and what was infinitely more important in the eye of the world, a very affluent fortune. At the age of twenty-one I married the moſt amiable of men, with whom I lived in an uninterrupted round of felicity for ſix and thirty years: during that period we had four ſons and three daughters, who are all provided for, both ſplendidly and fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the world, and enjoy the fulleſt ſweets of opulence in the midſt of the moſt perfect content.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT nine months ago, Sir, — O! that I had not ſurvived to recollect a time that now brings Baſiliſks to my imagination, and murders the moſt diſtant beam of comfort with a glance; — the man with whom I had lived ſo happily and ſo long, fell ill of a fever, and died in ten days. My diſtraction at his loſs was inexpreſſible, yet when my future conduct comes to be mentioned, I ſhall be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of diſingenuity, if I ſay I was concerned at it at all; but believe me, I felt every thing a woman endued with a moſt exquiſite ſenſibility could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly experience on ſo tender and afflicting an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and was reduced ſo low by the conflict which my mind had undergone, that when the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians preſcribed the Bath waters, it was univerſally thought I ſhould not hold out to the journey's end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0136400201:184"/>PROVIDENCE, however, which deſigned that I ſhould ſtand a warning to my ſex, to the ſurprize of my whole family, worked a miracle almoſt in favour of my health, and in about three months I was ſo perfectly recovered that I came up to town, and ſeemed not only to have left every trace of my indiſpoſition behind, but the principal marks of my age too; in ſhort, every body complimented me on the life of my looks, and raked the latent embers of vanity, which had a long, long time lain ſmothered in my heart, with ſo much ſucceſs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that upon a ſecret conſultation with my own wiſhes, I could not abſolutely conclude but I might be yet prevailed upon to change my condition, and make a ſecond venture on the ſmooth ocean of that ſtate which rendered my life ſuch a bleſſing in the firſt. — The moment a thought of this nature comes into the breaſt of an old woman, it clings like Cleopatra's aſps, and moſt commonly ſtings her to death. — For my own part, Sir, though I felt a ſecret repugnance at the notion of another huſband, yet the idea ſtuck cloſe to my imagination, and I even ſometimes endeavoured to perſuade myſelf that this honeſt averſion, which in ſpite of me, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would retain, was nothing but a prejudice of education or cuſtom, which it was highly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to ſubdue. My memory was ranſacked for inſtances where women in my circumſtances had married a ſecond time, with handſome young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows too, yet lived extremely happy, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vulgar and abominable ſuppoſition, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0136400201:185"/>
body could entertain a paſſion for a woman in years: nay, Mr. Babler, I found texts of ſcripture in ſupport of my favourite opinion, and abſolutely forced myſelf to believe that I was obliged by the very principles of religion to make another choice.</p>
                  <p>WHILE I was thus debating, Sir, my ſon Edward, who is a colonel in the army, brought a young fellow of his acquaintance to ſup at my houſe. — I do not know how it was, but I fancied he was the moſt handſome man I had ever ſeen in my life; his converſation too was ſo elegant, and he paid ſo profound a deference to my opinion, that I did not ſleep, — ſhame upon my antiquated eyelids, — a ſingle wink the whole night. What need I treſpaſs on your patience, major Ravage repeated his viſits, began to find he was far from diſagreeable, and in ſhort made an offer of his hand in ſuch terms as I was wholly unable to reſiſt. Without ever enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his character or his circumſtances, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be his at an age that would become me to wait upon my grand-children, and flattered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that his affection might be engaged to my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at the very moment I knew it to be entirely created by my purſe. My poor firſt huſband ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that as I had been a faithful wife to him, I ſhould be a tender mother to his children, left me in poſſeſſion of fifty thouſand pounds, and a jointure of three thouſand a year, every ſixpence of which, as far as I could, I nevertheleſs unnaturally ſettled on the villain who had taken the advantage of my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0136400201:186"/>
ſecond childhood, the morning after the celebration of our nuptials.</p>
                  <p>MY children you may be ſure would be juſtly offended at this prepoſterous match, and they were; but to be rid of upbraidings, — which cut me to the ſoul, — I quarrelled with them in turn, and forbad them ever to enter into my ſight: but alas! I had too ſoon an occaſion for their aſſiſtance and relief. A fortnight had ſcarcely paſſed, when major Ravage, without ſaying a ſingle ſyllable, ſet off for Bath with a tradeſman's wife in the city, and about an hour after his departure, an uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterer came in, demanding the poſſeſſion of my houſe and goods, having bought every thing that morning from my huſband. — I will not attempt to paint my aſtoniſhment, my fury, and my diſtreſs: it was too much for nature to ſupport, and I fell lifeleſs on the floor. — Not to tire your patience, Sir, — upon examining into every thing, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the major, he flatly refuſed either to ſend me a ſhilling, or ever to cohabit again with ſo ſtale a parcel of mortality,—that was his decent expreſſion. In this ſituation my eldeſt daughter came and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to her houſe, generouſly ſoothing me in the tendereſt manner, but wounding me however a thouſand times more by her goodneſs than ſhe could poſſibly do by ſeizing the opportunity to load me with complaints. I am now going to ſue for a ſeparate maintenance, and ſhall convince the grey-headed ſucklings of my ſex, that an old woman, who marries a young fellow, if ſhe even ſhould
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0136400201:187"/>
meet with a worthy one, can never expect to be treated with any tenderneſs or regard; and that on the other hand, if ſhe conſents to wed a villain, ſhe can look for nothing but an endleſs ſcene of poverty and contempt: where ſhe is moſt fortunate in her choice, neglect and ridicule muſt be her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and where ſhe happens to be otherwiſe, the public ſcorn of the world will be aggravated by a continual round of private wretchedneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.</p>

                  <p>SEEING a variety of letters in your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining paper, from huſbands and wives, I have taken the liberty of adding to the number of your matrimonial correſpondents, and doubt not but if you favour my complaint with a place, but what it will be attended with very ſalutary effects.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know, Sir, I am married to one of the moſt agreeable women in England, have an unabating paſſion for my wife, and every reaſon to imagine her ſentiments are equally tender for me; there is nothing of conſequence but what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtudy to oblige each other in; yet at the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0136400201:188"/>
ſame time there are a thouſand little trifles in which we are always ſure to diſagree, and which are not only an endleſs ſource of diſquiet to ourſelves, but of uneaſineſs to our whole family.</p>
                  <p>LAST night, for inſtance, Sir, after ſupper I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Nancy that a Vintner, who owed me a hundred pounds for ſome Liſbons, (for you muſt know I am a wine-merchant, Mr. Babler,) had failed, and that there was but little probability of expecting two and ſix-pence from the ſale of all his effects. I furthermore informed her, that I was much to blame in the affair, and that I had truſted this man contrary to the advice of an intimate friend, who was perfectly converſant with his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. My wife, inſtead of reprehending me for indiſcretion, as the generality of her ſex would have done in the ſame caſe, made uſe of every argument in her power to diſſipate my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin; told me, the moſt careful were unable now and then to avoid an error, and bid me conſole myſelf under my loſs, by thanking providence that I had not been a ſufferer in double the ſum. I was greatly charmed with this diſpoſition in Mrs. Mountain, Sir, and expreſſed my ſenſibility of it in a manner with which ſhe ſeemed infinitely pleaſed. Well, after all this would you imagine, Mr. Babler, that a moſt trivial circumſtance ſhould make us part beds for that night. My favourite liquor is a glaſs of punch, and it happens to be my wife's too; making a little as we were alone, I unluckily ſqueezed the pulp of the lemon into the bowl,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0136400201:189"/>
upon which ſhe immediately exclaimed with ſome warmth, "Lord, my dear, you have ſpoiled the punch,"—"No, my love, (replied I) the pulp gives it a fine flavour, and beſides you know I am very fond of it,"—" Ay, but (ſays ſhe) you are ſenſible I can't abide it;"—"Then, my dear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutned I, it is an eaſy matter to avoid putting any in your glaſs." — Lord, Mr. Mountain, I have ſpoke to you a thouſand times about this very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; I believe in my conſcience you do it on purpoſe to give me diſguſt."</p>
                  <p>HERE, Mr. Babler, we began a conteſt; ſeverity produced ſeverity, till at laſt I ordered a bed to be made for myſelf, and poor Nancy retired to her own, with her eyes ſmimming in tears.</p>
                  <p>FOR the whole night neither of us (for I judge of her by myſelf) had a ſingle wink of ſleep; we tumbled and toſſed, canvaſſed the matter fifty ways in our minds, and at laſt concluded, like Lockit and Peachum in the Beggar's Opera, that we were both in the wrong. Yet notwithſtanding all this, when we met at breakfaſt but an hour ago, neither of us would condeſcend to ſpeak firſt; we affected a reſentment of countenance, that was utterly ſovereign to our hearts, and endeavoured to keep up the appearance of an unremitting anger, when we both of us longed to be reconciled, and had the moſt paſſionate inclination to be pleaſed. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt was over before we exchanged a ſyllable, when the ſervant had left the room, prepared to go out, and had juſt got to the parlour door, when poor
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0136400201:190"/>
Nancy, unable to hold it out any longer, cried in a tone of irreſiſtible ſoftneſs, "And will you go without ſpeaking a word:" here our whole ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous quarrel was at an end: I turned to her with all the fondneſs I could poſſibly aſſume, and held her in my arms for ſome moments, while ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the fervor of the embrace, burſt into a flood of tears.</p>
                  <p>IT is inconceivable to think, Mr. Babler, how contemptible theſe little differences have made us in the eyes of our own ſervants. Whenever they ſee us cool towards one another, they titter and laugh, and ſay the poor things will ſoon kiſs and make it up again. It was no later ago than laſt week, that I overheard my raſcal of a coachman tell one of his fellow ſervants, that his maſter and miſtreſs were nothing better than an overgrown, boy and girl, and that he fancied a little of his, horſewhip would be of great ſervice to both of them. It is very odd, Mr. Babler, that people who really love one another, and are not wholly deſtitute of underſtanding, ſhould give way to ſuch reſentment in the mereſt trifles, who in the moſt important circumſtances of life, are above feeling the ſmalleſt reſentment, or entertaining the minuteſt diſeſteem. Many is the time, Sir, I have found fault with my wife for ſtirring the fire, when her ſpending five hundred pound has not given me the leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs; and many a time has ſhe fallen out with me, if in cutting up a fowl I happened to ſplaſh ever ſo ſmall a drop of gravy on the table cloth,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0136400201:191"/>
though ſhe has felt no diſcompoſure in life, if I ſpoiled a rich ſilk, or dirtied a fine head-dreſs. This morning, however, we have agreed as a means of keeping ourſelves from <hi>paſſions</hi> of this nature for the future, to ſend you the foregoing account, and if it ſhould turn out any way ſerviceable to others, as I hope it will, I ſhall have a double reaſon to ſign myſelf,</p>

               <p>THERE is a very ſenſible ſaying among the women, when any of their acquaintance happen to be brought to bed of a boy, and this is "that Mrs. ſuch-a-one has got one of the right ſort." In reality there are ſo many dangers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the education of a young lady to years of maturity, and there are ſuch a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to deſtroy her reputation, which, through the faſhionable depravity of the times, are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſo many excellencies in the other ſex, that I am no way ſurprized to find people parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly rejoiced at having "one of the right ſort," as it is emphatically expreſſed; ſince the ſatisfaction of the parent is conſiderably leſs expoſed, as well as the happineſs of the child; to ſay nothing of the infinitely greater eaſe with which the infant can be brought up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0136400201:192"/>WHEN I ſeriouſly conſider the cuſtomary mode of educating the fair <hi>ſex,</hi> inſtead of being ſurprized to find ſo many turn out an affliction to their friends, or a diſgrace to ſociety, I am in fact aſtoniſhed that we do not find a multitude more, Now-a-days, inſtead of being attentive to the cultivation of a young lady's mind, our regard is entirely engroſſed by the accompliſhments of her perſon; and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of our mothers are totally unconcerned whether or no their daughters are acquainted with the moſt neceſſary duties of religion, provided they can make a tollerable figure at a party of whiſt, and turn out their toes.</p>
               <p>FROM the firſt moment little miſs is ſent to ſchool, ſhe is provided with a doll, perhaps as large again as herſelf; and is inſtructed in the neceſſary manner of dreſſing it properly, and ſending it quietly to bed. Thus in the earlieſt ſtage her mind receives a turn for gallantry and dreſs, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly ſtrengthens with her years, and being accuſtomed to nothing but compliments on her beauty, ſhe becomes utterly indifferent to every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; the little reading ſhe is miſtreſs of, is rather a prejudice than a benefit, for as it is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally compoſed of novels, it conſtantly warms her imagination with ſentiments of intrigue, and adds to the opinion which ſhe entertained of her own perſon and underſtanding; hence ſhe fancies her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the heroine of every extravagant romance, till at laſt, from an admiration of the character, ſhe really takes it up, and runs off, if in high life,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0136400201:193"/>
with ſome Amadis of a ſubaltern officer; and if in low, with a ſtrolling player or a barber's boy.</p>
               <p>THE ſcandalous neglect of female education, may however be put down to the account of the other ſex: by a cuſtom no leſs arbitrary than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, we cut them off from a liberal inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet at the very time that we lay a manacle on their underſtandings, affect to deſpiſe them for fools:—As if they were beings totally oppoſite by nature to ourſelves, we fancy that the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of mind, which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for us, is utterly improper for them; and ſuppoſe that the better capable they are of acting in life, the worſe they muſt behave of courſe. Such are the ſentiments entertained by the high and mighty lords of the creation, relative to the education of the ladies. What wonder, therefore, or what pity is it, that we are ſo frequently unhappy in our daughters and our wives? Are we not in fact anſwerable for every error reſulting from their ignorance, ſince that ignorance is principally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ourſelves? And ſhould we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, inſtead of throwing the whole blame at their doors, remove it entirely to our own?</p>
               <p>I SHALL conclude this paper with a few memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums, written by an excellent young lady lately deceaſed, who was brought up in a very different manner from the generality of her ſex: they were communicated to me yeſterday by her father, with tears in his eyes, and ſhall ſtand as a laſting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>NEXT to an invariable rectitude of conduct there is no light in which the character of a man can poſſibly appear ſo amiable as in a hearty concern for his errors, eſpecially thoſe which are
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0136400201:196"/>
more the conſequence of human infirmity than the effect of a mean premeditation. — In proportion to the repentance or atonement, we are apt to raiſe him in our eſteem; and it is not the leaſt part of his merit, that libertines themſelves are loſt in an admiration of his behaviour, however ſlow, through a ridiculous fear of public contempt, they may be to imitate an action which they cannot in ſpite of faſhion or education forbear to love.</p>
               <p>MY nephew, Harry Rattle, called upon me this morning, and after the uſual how do you do of the day, pulled out a letter from the identical Mr. Bumper, whom in a former paper I mentioned as having ſent Harry a challenge for refuſing to drink a ſtrumpet he had toaſted one night after ſupper at his own houſe. — Mr. Bumper is a young man of nine and twenty, who has received a liberal edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; is in poſſeſſion of twelve hundred pounds a year; and though he has launched pretty freely into the cuſtomary exceſſes of the times, has been diſſolute rather from faſhion than inclination. — For a few weeks paſt he has been at a tenant's in Berkſhire, from whence, two days ago, he ſent the following letter to Harry, with permiſſion to communicate it through my means to the notice of the public.</p>

                  <p>IN my laſt letter I told you how deeply I was ſtruck with the perſon of Sally Poplar, my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0136400201:197"/>
daughter, and expreſſed an intention of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out immediately for London, for fear I ſhould ſucceed in any deſign prejudicial to her innocence and virtue. — Yet notwithſtanding I was perfectly convinced how neceſſary a ſtep of that nature would be, I could not work myſelf up to a ſufficient reſolution of quitting the place. — I flattered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf I ſhould be able to reſiſt every temptation, yet indulge myſelf a few days longer under the ſame roof with the bewitching ruſtic; and though I knew it would be impoſſible to poſſeſs this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without ſaying ſome tender things to her; I nevertheleſs thought I ſhould avoid carrying matters to any critical length, by a criminal importunity. — From my example however, the unthinking part of our acquaintance may be inſtructed, that it is infinitely wiſer to fly from a temptation, than to combat with an opportunity. — The moment a man is alone with a woman he admires, and from whom he has received ſome indications of recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal eſteem, human nature muſt not be human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if he does not endeavour to improve ſo fair an occaſion of gratifying his wiſhes: he may fancy he will go to ſuch and ſuch lengths, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but paſſion will hurry him imperceptibly from liberty to liberty, and he will find it utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to retain the leaſt conſideration for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy girl, when he has totally loft all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was my caſe the night before laſt; Sally and I lay on the ſame floor, and ſhe had promiſed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0136400201:198"/>
to let me chat half an hour with her before ſhe went to bed. — This half hour was productive of another and another, till at laſt the poor girl was worked up to ſuch a pitch of tenderneſs, that ſhe could refuſe nothing; and then it was I found, in ſpite of all my humanity, that there was no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of getting off. — It would have been very ſtrange, after preſſing three hours for the laſt favour, which all the time I was in hopes would have been refuſed, if I had withdrawn the moment it was granted: the conſequence therefore was, that after I had been raſcal enough to deprive her of her reaſon, I was villain enough to ſeize the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which that ſuſpenſion gave me;

                  <p>WE had ſcarcely fallen aſleep, (do not laugh, Rattle, we ſlept upon my ſoul) but old Mrs. Poplar having, as ſhe imagined, forgot to ſee that the kitchen fire was out, (a piece of care which ſhe never omitted,) came down ſtairs, and paſſing by Sally's door, which in the confuſion of affairs we had neglected to lock, turned the bolt and came in. — I need not attempt to paint her aſtoniſhment, — nor, upon being waked, our own ſurprize. — Sally ſhrieked, and hid beneath the cloathes; Mrs. Poplar wrung her hands in a fit of unutterable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and deſired her huſband to come inſtantly down; the good man, terrified out of his wits for fear his deſk had been broke open, or his houſe ſet on flames, made what haſte he could: but never

was diſtreſs or conſternation ſo great, as when he found out the real ſituation of affairs, and beheld the deſtruction of his only child: for a moment he was petrified; till at laſt recovering the uſe of his recollection, he caſt a look at me, that cut me to the very ſoul, and crying, O Sir! burſt into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent flood of tears. — In my life I never was ſo much affected; I felt myſelf truly deſpicable, and was at once torn with ſhame and remorſe. — To a man not utterly deſtitute of humanity and reflexion, Harry, no circumſtances could be ſo mortifying; inſtead of gratitude for the cordial welcome which I had received in the houſe of my friend, I had violated the hoſpitality of his roof, and robbed the darling of his age, of what ought to be infinitely dearer than her life. — The girl I doated on to death ſeemed abſorbed in diſtraction, and her worthy parents were almoſt loſt in deſpair. — What could I do Harry? the torture of the damned was an Elyſium to what I ſuffered; and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, of what ſervice was it to repent? Thus ſituated, I begged Mr. Poplar and his wife to withdraw till I was dreſſed, and then I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſatisfy them: they did ſo, and went down to the parlour; I followed them in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and ſummoning all the fortitude I could, delivered myſelf to the following purport: <q>I will not, my good Mr. and Mrs. Poplar, go about to excuſe the tranſactions of to-night, but own myſelf a very dirty ſcoundrel; however, as there is no poſſibility of recalling what is paſt, I ſhall
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0136400201:200"/>
readily make all the atonement in my power, and if I have your conſent, will marry Sally to-morrow morning.</q> — The tranſport of the worthy old couple was now as violent as their ſorrow had been but a moment before. — Mr. Poplar looked at me for ſome time with a fixed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, then broke into an exceſſive laugh which poſſibly might have proved fatal had he not thrown himſelf into his great chair, and found a ſeaſonable relief in a flood of tears.</p>
                  <p>WELL, Harry, what ſay you to my behaviour? I have been married a week, and am convinced that virtue is it's own reward; for in my days I never taſted felicity till now; every eye beams on me with gratitude and eſteem, and when I enter into an examination of my own heart, all is approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and joy. — I am ſatisfied of your concurrence, my dear Harry, and as for fools and raſcals, their opinions is what a man of ſpeculation muſt both deſpiſe and deteſt; it is not for the ſatisfaction of others we are to live, but our own; therefore thoſe actions which ſecure that ſatisfaction, ſince it muſt always be founded on a rectitude of principle, are the beſt teſts, both of the goodneſs of our hearts and the ſoundneſs of our underſtandings.</p>

               <p>IT was an admirable reply which Socrates once made to an impertinent coxcomb, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what he would do if there was no other world after this. I need not inform the intelligent reader that this celebrated philoſopher was as eminent for the rectitude of his life as the greatneſs of his underſtanding, and that upon all occaſions he maintained the certainty of a future ſtate, where every man was to be rewarded according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. — <q>What ſhall I do, returned Socrates, if there is not another world after this?</q> 
                  <q>Why, at any rate I ſhall be as well off as you are? — But what will you do if there is?</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is really ſurprizing that the force of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent anſwer is not always preſent to the minds of thoſe people who either take upon them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to deny the exiſtence of another world, or act in ſuch a manner as if they looked upon a belief of it to be utterly ridiculous and abſurd. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon policy, one would imagine, ſhould incline them to a uniform rectitude of life, if they were not actuated by real goodneſs, and inſpire, if to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inſenſible of gratitude to the great author of their being, ſomething like a reaſonable concern for themſelves.</p>
               <p>WHEN we conſider, though ever ſo ſlightly, on the nature of man, and reflect on the important
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0136400201:202"/>
ſomething which is continually deciding upon every action, in the human boſom, we can ſcarcely think it poſſible that there is one man in the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of creation, who is dead to the belief of a future ſtate, or is really of opinion that there is no ſuch being as a God. His own heart muſt be an evidence againſt him, and he muſt feel the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of another exiſtence, though he may be apt to cry out with CATO, "when or where?"</p>
               <p>BUT however if there is even a poſſibility to ſuppoſe ſuch a claſs of creatures as Atheiſts in being, yet every day's experience will point out millions to our view whoſe ſituation is infinitely more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and who are more entitled to the abhorrence of the world as well as more expoſed to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of their God. A diſordered mind or a weak underſtanding may be advanced as ſome little miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the wretch's infidelity who denies the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of his Creator; but what excuſe can he have, who acknowle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Atheiſt, if we ſuppoſe any rational creature can be an Atheiſt, lives conſiſtent with himſelf;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0136400201:203"/>
he looks upon this world as the final ſtage of his exiſtence, and conſequently has no occaſion to act like thoſe who are in a poſitive expectation of future puniſhments and rewards. Hence he is juſtified in making the moſt of the preſent world, and has a kind of title to follow every purſuit that has a tendency to promote his intereſt or gratify his inclinations without any regard to the means.</p>
               <p>BUT ſurely the man who kneels down reverently at the throne of the Divine Being, pours out his ſoul in thankfulneſs for paſt bleſſings, or in ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for future benefits, is to the laſt degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable as well as inconſiſtent, when he runs from the immediate temple and preſence of his God, to ſome licentious ſcene of immorality, the participation of ſome criminal enjoyment, or the proſecution of ſome infamous purſuit. Yet alas! What numbers have we, who after endeavouring to obtain a reconciliation with the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, fly, while the awful benediction of the church is quite freſh and warm upon their heads, and plunge into all the vices which but the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before they were ſupplicating the goodneſs of Omnipotence to obliterate and forgive.</p>
               <p>IT is to me aſtoniſhing what men who believe the certainty of a divine being, can think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or what idea they can entertain of their God. One moment they are all devotion and penitence; the next we find them ſteeped in the moſt glaring contradictions and crimes: one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0136400201:204"/>
they are imploring the King of heaven and earth with a rapture of gratitude and reverence; yet the very next, as if all their ſupplications were ſo many abſolute deſigns of turning him into ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule or contempt, they circulate an audacious laugh at his inſtitutions, and make a daring mockery of his laws. Nay more, they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go into his very temple, as if they wanted to aggravate the unparallelled impiety of their conduct, and there, in the very place immediately dedicated to his ſervice, they proſecute the moſt ſhameleſs viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his commands. There they very frequently go under the ſacred maſk of religion and virtue, to ſeduce unſuſpecting innocence to ſhame; to lodge ſcorpions in the breaſt of ſome unhappy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and drench a mother's pillow in miſery and tears.</p>
               <p>LET me calmly aſk the believers of a future ſtate, if abſolute Atheiſm is a crime more unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable than this? Of what ſervice is our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another life, if we only employ our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have that life marked out to everlaſting torments and deſpair? Of what advantage is our religion, if we act in ſuch a manner as to make that religion at once our condemnation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace? Or of what utility is our acknowledgment of a God, if the acknowledgment of ſuch a Being muſt harrow up the ſoul, and goad it with unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable ſtings? Atheiſm is almoſt a refuge in ſuch a caſe, and it is much more conſiſtent to cry out

with the moſt abandoned profligate our imgagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can form, that there is no exiſtence after this, than exclaim in the language of the divine Socrates, "What ſhall we do if there is?"</p>

                  <p>AS you ſeem good-naturedly ready to pay greater regard to the circumſtances than the compliments of your correſpondents, I ſhall begin with as little ceremony as I intend taking leave, and neither treſpaſs on your leiſure with a fulſome encomium nor an unneceſſary excuſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0136400201:206"/>You muſt know, Sir, I am the daughter of a private gentleman in Oxfordſhire, who had a large family to provide for, upon a very moderate eſtate. There were ſix of us, and but three hundred a year to anſwer all contingencies. — Happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I was the only girl amongſt them, ſo that with a little intereſt, as my father was generally beloved, four of my brothers were fortunate enough, to be preferred in the navy, the army, and public offices; the eldeſt and myſelf were the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining children at home, and my poor papa, whoſe favourites we particularly ſeemed to be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to compenſate by an unwearied attention to our education, for the apparent narrowneſs of our fortunes. — As for me, before I was fifteen, beſides all the cuſtomary needleworks peculiar to my ſex, I ſpoke French and Italian pretty tollerably, danced an eaſy minuet enough; ſung an agreeable little ſong, and played a leſſon at ſight on my harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord: what was however infinitely more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, though now ſeldom conſidered as any part of a young woman's education, I could never ſleep without ſaying my prayers, and at church was no way aſhamed of repeating the ten commandments or raiſing a pſalm with the reſt of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. — My perſon was not in the leaſt tortured into any faſhionable form by ſtrait laicing; and as for my face, it was rather more wholeſome than lovely, and not ſo much diſtinguiſhed by any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing delicacy of complexion as by a certain air of complacency and chearfulneſs, which I flatter
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0136400201:207"/>
myſelf beſpoke neither a corrupt heart nor a total want of underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>EXCUSE me, Mr. Babler, for being thus tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and perhaps vainly circumſtantial about either my acquired or perſonal qualifications; but as they were the only cauſes of my great, (I muſt not ſay my good fortune) I thought there might be ſome neceſſity for more than a curſory deſcription of both.</p>
                  <p>BETWEEN the age of fifteen and twenty, ſuch as my little attractions were, they procured me no inconſiderable ſhare of admirers, and I had more than one opportunity of marrying very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: no perſon however engaging my inclination, my father never offered to preſs me on the ſubject, but always tenderly declared his poor girl ſhould chooſe for herſelf in a caſe where ſhe was the moſt principally intereſted. — When I was juſt turned of twenty, an occaſion for ſuch a choice occured; and he readily conſented to the ſolicitations of a young gentleman, who had been left an eſtate of eight hundred a year, in our neighbourhood, by the will of a relation at that time about ſix months deceaſed.</p>
                  <p>BUT alas, Sir, ſee the uncertainty of all human expectations; three or four days before the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſolemnization of our nuptials, a certain noble earl, of an immenſe fortune, had his carriage acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally broke down within a few yards of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's — Mr. Bilſon my lover, and I, were looking out of the window at that inſtant, and immediately
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0136400201:208"/>
ran out to offer the civilities of the houſe to his lordſhip, who frankly accepted the invitation, and ſtaid there the whole night. — My father made every thing as agreeable as could be to his illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gueſt, and was not a little ſurprized the next morning, when the nobleman told him I had made an impreſſion on his heart, and offered a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement ſo very large, that, my poor papa dazzled with that, and the deſire of ſeeing his favourite Nancy a counteſs, immediately forgot all his former reſolutions, to allow me a liberty of chooſing for myſelf, and declared his lordſhip ſhould be put in poſſeſſion of my hand whenever he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to mention a day for that purpoſe. — Why need I treſpaſs on your patience, Mr. Babler, to paint either my own diſtraction or the frantic be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Mr. Bilſon. — Suffice it, Sir, that in a week after, I was dragged half dead to the altar, and torn from the only man I ever could love, to be wedded to one whom I never can.</p>
                  <p>THE ſubject of my complaint, Sir, now comes to be mentioned.— I have been married three years, and endeavoured to make the moſt of my wretched circumſtances, by compenſating with the ſtricteſt diſcharge of my duty, for an apparent want of love. — This is not ſufficient for his lordſhip: mortified that he can engage no return of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he is perpetually reproaching me with a want of gratitude; and always telling me of his prodigious condeſcenſion in raiſing me to the rank of a counteſs, from the former obſcurity of my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0136400201:209"/>
— Thus, Sir, he thinks I am obliged to him for making me miſerable; and imagines I ought to ſtudy nothing but the continual repoſe of his boſom, becauſe he has generouſly planted everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daggers in mine. — There are many women, Mr. Babler, alike unhappily circumſtanced; it would therefore be kind, if you deſired our diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted huſbands to remember for whoſe ſake they have thus graciouſly honoured us with their names; and to conſider, it was not out of any regard for the promotion of our wiſhes, but through a mean, and very often an illiberal deſire of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their own.— Your paper is left at our houſe once a week, and if you will inſert this, my lord will perhaps be convinced he is more intitled to my averſion than my eſteem, and be fully ſatisfied he has made me</p>

                  <p>YOU muſt know, Mr. Babler, I was ſent very early to the Univerſity, in order to get myſelf qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for a living, which a certain nobleman had in his gift, and which he repeatedly aſſured my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be at my ſervice on the death of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, if it was thought worth while on that account to educate me for the church. Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately however, before I was at Oxford three years, his lordſhip, who had ſat up all night, was taken off by an unexpected accident; for mounting a ſtrange hunter the next morning at a gentleman's ſeat, where he was then upon a viſit; he purſued the game with too incautious a reſolution, and broke his neck in taking a five barr'd gate: with him periſhed my expectations; and I was taken from the College directly.</p>
                  <p>DURING my ſtay at the Univerſity, I made ſeveral little eſſays in the various walks of literature, merely for my amuſement, which were ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly received by thoſe exalted geniuſes the compilers of magazines, that they generally honoured them with the appellation of elegant, and requeſted the continuation of my correſpondence; this gave me a ſtrong propenſity to writing, and as I looked upon an author to be the greateſt of all ſublunary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, I was ambitious of gaining ſo honourable a title, and through this unaccountable infatuation, neglected every neceſſary means of promoting my future intereſt and fortune. It is true, my father
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0136400201:212"/>
bound me to an eminent attorney; but alas, Sir, Homer and Virgil were conſulted infinitely more than either Littleton or Coke; and inſtead of Replies, Rejoinders, or Demurrers, I was in the midſt of term engaged in writing ſome poetical whimſies of my own, or in commenting on thoſe of other people. The little all that came to me on my father's deceaſe was ſoon expended, and I found myſelf in an inſtant left to buſtle through an inhoſpitable world, without either money, buſineſs, or bread. In this dilemma neceſſity obliged me to have recourſe to the bookſellers: I was accordingly enliſted into the army of literary mercenaries, and, like the humbleſt claſs of ſoldiers, obliged for the moſt pitiful pittance, to run a frequent riſque of my reputation, and ſometimes a dangerous hazard of my life. Fame indeed came in tollerably faſt, but ſtill I ran deeper and deeper into debt: I was totally unacquainted with the cuſtoms of the trade, and the bookſellers having me in their power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly treated me as they pleaſed. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to my regular hours of work as if I was a ſhoemaker or a taylor, and very often ordered to do a particular quantity in a particular time. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, Sir, I have been obliged to write a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical eſſay on contentment, when my heart was burſting with anguiſh; and at others, ordered to produce a poem on liberty, while the bailiffs were waiting at the door; but the ſevereſt mortification of all was, the impertinent freedom with which I was treated by every ragamuffin of the preſs; the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0136400201:213"/>
printer would criticiſe on my performances to my face; and the very devils themſelves would talk to me of miſtakes, and propoſe what they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly pleaſed to conſider as amendments; nay, ſometimes they have invited me to club for a pot of porter, or aſked me to take a game at all-fours at the Gooſe and Gridiron. For fourteen years, Mr. Babler, did I continue this comfortable life, when laſt winter but one, having written a political trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe which occaſioned ſome noiſe, a nobleman of great eminence kindly enquired for the author, found me out, generouſly paid my debts, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me an apartment in his own houſe: I now thought myſelf made for ever; but I had ſcarcely been a month in the houſe, when my lord's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of my abilities began to abate a little; he expected as an author that I ſhould ſupport every abſurdity he advanced in an argument; and as a man of genius, that I ſhould always be comical. With this view he introduced me into all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; but when he ſaw I would neither be his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſite nor his buffoon, his friendſhip very viſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined: at table I was inſulted with the propoſal of a wager wherever I preſumed to diſſent in opinion, and then it was inſtantly recollected with a loud laugh, that authors were but ſeldom overburthened with money. In the largeſt circle of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, my lord by an affected compliment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, would paint out my former diſtreſs, and then inſinuate the merit of his own generoſity in relieving it: at other times, he uſed me with an
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0136400201:214"/>
intollerable inſolence of ſuperiority, and then affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſpleaſed when he put me out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; in ſhort, I almoſt determined to go back to my old profeſſion again, as thinking it better to ſuffer a ſecret affront, than to be thus publickly contemptible; I was ſoon ſettled in my reſolution, for the dining-room jeſts on my profeſſion and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances began to be bandied about in the kitchen; and the Butler, under a pretened air of ſimplicity and ignorance, came one day up to my apartment, and begged me to raiſe the devil, that he might enquire after one or two of his ſilver ſpoons. Providence however took pity on me at laſt; a worthy gentleman, whoſe memory I ſhall ever revere, that had ſeen me two or three times at my lord's table, thought of me ſo kindly as to ſet me down a hundred a year for life in his will, and as he was very old and infirm, ſcarcely ſurvived his generous donation ten days. I heard of it but the very morning I took my leave of his lordſhip; and though I dropt a tear to the memory of my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, I could not help rejoicing at ſo fortunate an alteration in my circumſtances. I have now lived a twelvemonth in Derbyſhire, quite happy in myſelf and reſpected by every body, and have ſent you this letter to point out the real cauſe of that decline in literature, which has of late years been ſo univerſally complained of in this kingdom. My ſtory requires no animadverſion; as every man of ſenſe muſt exclaim with the poet,

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT was a very wiſe ſaying of an old Philoſopher, that Happineſs was infinitely ſweeter in the Expectation than in the Poſſeſſion, ſince the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of mankind are rather apt to over-value what they have not, and to ſet too ſmall an eſtimation upon what they actually have. I remember, Sir, about thirty years ago, when my circumſtances were a little contracted, I fancied no man could be miſerable who was maſter of a great eſtate: 'Tis inconceivable how I uſed to lye in bed of a morning building caſtles in the air, and chalking out future plans of generoſity and magnificence if my ſtars ſhould ever kindly indulge me with this <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of human felicity! — I have been a member of Parliament; have drawn up an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Sir <hi>Robert</hi>; — harangued the Houſe like a Cherubim; — received gold boxes from every corporation in the kingdom; — refuſed a Peerage; — and, married, a woman of exquiſite
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0136400201:216"/>
beauty and immenſe fortune, in the ſpace of half an hour; when, oh dreadful cataſtrophe! all theſe golden fantaſies have been in an inſtant ſwept from my imaginations, by the milk-woman's yell at the door, the falling of the tongs, or the accidental jump of our old black cat.</p>
                  <p>YET, Sir, though my finances were moderate enough at the time I am ſpeaking of, ſtill I found more ſatisfaction in indulging thoſe imaginary, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of felicity than ever I experienced ſince I came, by the death of a very diſtant relation, to the poſſeſſion of two thouſand pounds a year. I flatter myſelf I am no more of the miſer than the generality of my neighbours; and, if know my own heart, it is as likely to feel for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the unfortunate, and as willing to relieve them, as ſome whom I know to pique themſelves mightily on the humanity of their tempers. But this is not the point — My fortune has, I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſay, unhinged the ſyſtem upon which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly built my happineſs, and the actual poſſeſſion cuts off every pleaſure which originally reſulted from a chimerical expectation.</p>
                  <p>THIS you will probably look upon as a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary circumſtance, but it is nevertheleſs literally true; inſtead of being able to reap any great pleaſure from an eſtate, I find it productive of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but uneaſineſs and anxiety; my wants are very limited and ſoon gratified; and the very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflux of fortune, which to any other man might poſſibly be a matter of the higheſt ſatisfaction, is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0136400201:217"/>
to me a conſtant ſource of vexation and regret. In the firſt place, I have no child to enjoy my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions after I am gone, and I am nothing more than amaſſing for people, who envy me when liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will in all likelihood deſpiſe me when dead: The very man to whom I leave my eſtate, will perhaps be the firſt to d—n the old curmud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon for not tipping off half a dozen years ſooner, and thoſe for whom I am continually doing a great deal, the readieſt to execrate my memory becauſe I have not done a great deal more.</p>
                  <p>BUT though a ſenſibility of this nature might in ſome meaſure render me regardleſs to the care of my affairs, I look upon it as an indiſpenſible part of my duty to prevent as much as poſſible the leaſt diſadvantage from my negligence and inattention; and am leſs fearful of the <hi>probable</hi> contempt I <hi>may</hi> meet from my relations, than the <hi>certain</hi> ridicule I <hi>muſt</hi> ſuffer from my tenants and dependants, was I to wink at a continual plunder of my property, and to permit them indiſcriminately to grow opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at my expence. Thus any way, Sir, whether I exert a commendable prudence, or throw it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aſide, this unfortunate eſtate "clings like a deteſted ſin to my rememberance," and poiſons every comfort which I once was weak enough to imagine it would have produced. If it rains for any time, I am fearful my corn will be waſhed away; if the weather is uncommonly fine, I am apprehenſive of its being parched up; if it freezes with ſeverity, alas, for my poor flower-garden;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0136400201:218"/>
if the wind happens to be high, my apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees are deſtroyed; and if it ſhows, I am in an abſolute ague about my little lambs, and eternally ſcolding John and Thomas for not taking ſufficient care to preſerve them from the inclemency of the weather; thus again, in whatever manner the wiſdom of the Deity thinks proper to direct the ſeaſons, I am ſure to ſhew an impious diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his decrees, and, to uſe the emphatical words of Mr. Pope, with a little alteration,
<q>
                        <l>Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>FROM my ſituation, Mr. Babler, let thoſe in the lower claſſes of life, who murmur at the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence, and think it uncommonly hard to toil for a precarious ſubſiſtence while their neighbours are rolling it away in coaches and ſix, learn to conſider that it is not the dignity of rank, or the affluence of fortune, which is the ſource of real felicity, but a man's own mind; let them learn to conſider that this very rank and this very opulence for which they continually languiſh, are very often the cauſes of the moſt ſevere affliction; and that the ſwelling dome of courtly magnificence undergoes many a ſtorm, which the humility of the villager's ſituation keeps from breaking on his little ſhed.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE good-natured readineſs with which I ſee you inſert a variety of letters upon domeſtic occurrences, has induced me to trouble you with a complaint againſt my huſband, in hopes that his error may be avoided by others at leaſt, though it ſhould fail of the intended reformation in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>YOU muſt know, Sir, my good man is a ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper near Cripplegate, and as honeſt a pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking young fellow as any of his buſineſs; but his notions are rather too elevated for his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; ſo that neither the ſtricteſt induſtry nor the moſt rigid integrity, are likely to carry him proſperouſly through life, unleſs I can prevail upon him to change the preſent frame of his inclination. As the principal part of his acquaintance are tradeſmen of eminence, and have their ſnug little country houſes to retire to of a Sunday, my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band determined to make as genteel a figure as the beſt of them, and accordingly took a handſome box enough laſt ſummer near Stratford. It was in vain that I repreſented the inconveniences which it would inevitably produce, or mentioned a word about the prodigious expence. I was told that Mr. Refine, the Goldſmith, our next door neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, was as little able to afford ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0136400201:220"/>
as ourſelves; it was obſerved, that Sir Richard Steele ſomewhere ſaid, the ſureſt method of making a good fortune, was to carry the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an eaſy one; and that ſurely it was very hard, if we could not have a place where we might enjoy a little peace and quietneſs one day in the week. To crown the whole, my huſband, like many other people, when they have a favourite point to carry, was reſolved to find reaſons enough to ſupport not only the propriety but the abſolute neceſſity of his behaviour, and brought one which was unanſwerable; he complained his health was conſiderably impaired by a conſtant reſidence in town, and inſiſted that nothing but a change of air was able to recover it. This ſilenced me at once; and a houſe of twenty-ſix pounds a year, with a neat pretty garden behind it, was taken immediately, contiguous to the road ſide, for the greater facility of taking the ſtage coach, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various rounds of company that paſſed by.</p>
                  <p>As our houſe has a very reputable appearance without, my huſband was reſolved that a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence ſhould be kept up within; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore furniſhed it very genteelly, laying out no leſs than three hundred pounds for this purpoſe. So large a ſum expended as I may ſay upon an unneceſſary account, was not a little inconvenient to a young couple, ſcarcely four years in trade, and whoſe capital at firſt was rather moderate: In fact, Sir, we ſoon felt it, and were under the diſagreeable exigence of borrowing the ſame ſum,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0136400201:221"/>
at an intereſt of five per cent, to keep up our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with a proper degree of conſequence and punctuality. Well, Sir, every thing being in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at our new habitation, we entered upon it, to enjoy a mouthful of freſh air and a little repoſe from the fatigues of the week. But ſee the uncertainty of all human expectations; the fairer the weather, the more we were deprived of the air; for being ſituated ſo immediately on the road, we were choaked with a cloud of duſt if the window was kept open but a ſingle moment; and had no other proſpect, but what was furniſhed by a lifeleſs ſtare through an humble pain of glaſs: if we retired backwards, we loſt the variety which company af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, and ſtood a chance of being ſerenaded with the muſic of half a hundred hogs, which our next door neighbour had conſtantly breeding in his yard.</p>
                  <p>THIS circumſtance was very diſagreeable; but ſtill a material conſolation remained, that of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying our Sundays wholly uninterrupted: but here alſo, Mr. Babler, we were quickly unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The moment we entered, our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance formed parties to dine at our houſe, and any three or four who were at a loſs to kill a Sunday, agreed, without any heſitation, to go and eat a bit of mutton with their friend, Will Sheffield, the hardware-man. By this means, Sir, inſtead of retiring to tranquility and repoſe, we opened a new ſcene of buſtle and confuſion; and kept a houſe for no other purpoſe, but to bring on an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0136400201:222"/>
everlaſting round of drudgery, and a very heavy expence. Thoſe who know any thing of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping, Mr. Babler, are ſenſible how ſmall a way a guinea goes in providing a decent entertainment for half a dozen people. I therefore leave you to judge, how agreeably I muſt be ſituated, when forced to wear a conſtant appearance of the utmoſt ſatisfaction to the very people, whom, in my heart, I could have wiſhed in a horſe-pond, or ſcolded-out of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>DISAPPOINTED in all his expectation, Mr. Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and the charm of novelty being alſo worn away, my huſband is heartily ſick of his villa; yet is both aſhamed and affraid to throw it off his hands; he is fearful his friends will circulate the laugh againſt him, and is apprehenſive his enemies will make uſe of it to prejudice him in his trade: I have told him over and over, it is better for him to be thought a blockhead, than to prove himſelf one; and much more to his intereſt to bear a caſual reflection on his circumſtances, than to be a beggar at once: I have pointed out a variety of tradeſmen, whoſe ruin originally proceeded from the vanity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a country houſe, but all to no purpoſe; for though he acknowledges the juſtice of my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he remains incorrigible; and therefore I have thought it better to print his name in your paper than ſuffer it to appear in the London Gazette.</p>
                  <p>WE have now three children, Sir, and this curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed country houſe, which we have not ſet a foot
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0136400201:223"/>
in but twice during the whole winter, runs away with as much as would maintain my whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—Let me only preſent you with a curſory eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate:</p>

                  <p>I DONT know a more prevailing error at preſent among all ranks of people, than an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſguiſe their real ſituation in life, by an appearance totally inconſiſtant with their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and circumſtances. This reflexion I am naturally led into by a viſit which I paid the other morning to my old friend, Sir Timothy Trotter who has been many years in a declining way with the gout; but, who, nevertheleſs, like another lord Chalkſtone, is all life and ſpirits in the lucid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, as I may ſay, of his diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>WHEN I was ſhewed up ſtairs, it did not a little ſurprize me, to ſee two fellows, dreſſed like grooms, ſitting very familiarly by Sir Timothy's elbow-chair, with jockey-whips in their hands, talking in a careleſs indolent manner of hot maſhes, long ſtirrups, curry-combs, and curbs: as my old friend had always been remarkable for keeping the beſt company, I was the more amazed at ſo odd a couple of viſitors. I remember to have dined with him at the ſquare, when there have been half a dozen ſtars in the room, beſides the two arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops; and three of the foreign ambaſſadors. However, as it was no buſineſs of mine, I ſat down, and, in a little time, to my inexpreſſible aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0136400201:225"/>
heard that theſe two deſpicable looking things were no leſs than two noblemen of very great fortune, the earl of Snaffle worth and my lord Donefirſt.</p>
                  <p>STRUCK as I was at that time, I could not help reflecting, how unworthy a nobleman of Great Britain, a man born to be a legiſlator in the moſt generous country of the univerſe, and honoured with ſo great a degree of political ſanctity, that his bare affirmation was conſidered as important as an oath, ſhould be dreſt in a dirty pair of boots, greaſy leather breeches, a ſtriped flannel waiſtcoat, a thread-bare drab-coat, and a little round hat like a waterman's. No wonder, thought I, that the French ſhould look upon us as a nation of paltry-minded people, when we ſtudy to appear contemptible; and our very nobility, who ought to glory in keeping up the conſequence of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, are aſhamed to look like what they are; and ſneak from the dignity of titles into the high and mighty quality of grooms.</p>
                  <p>WHILE I was thus reflecting, the ſervant came up, and told Sir Thomas, that Doctor Styptic, and Mr. Skirts the taylor, were below ſtairs; upon which he was ordered, without much compliment I thought, to the Doctor, to ſend them both up: he did ſo; and a well-looking man, of about fifty, firſt entered, dreſſed in a very handſome ſuit of full-trimm'd black, a large deep-bottom'd wig, and every neceſſary article requiſite for the ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the faculty. — Ay, thinks I, this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0136400201:226"/>
is perfectly in character; and is, I dare ſay, a ſenſible perſon, by ſo cloſe an adherence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. I had ſcarcely made the reflexion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when Sir Thomas cried out, <q>So Skirts, have you brought the breeches home?</q> to which having received an anſwer in the affirmative, he returned, <q>Well, that's an honeſ fellow — go about your buſineſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>BEING ſo much diſappointed in the taylor, I wiſhed for the Doctor's appearance, and wondered what the deuce could detain him ſo long: at laſt, the door opened, and a gentleman entered in a ſuit of ſpotted ſilk, his hair nicely dreſt and bagg'd; and nothing about him but what beſpoke the very meridian of Pariſian elegance. — Thinks I, if this ſhould be the Doctor! — My conjecture was not ill-founded; this was the identical ſon of Galen, whom, if I had not ſeen actually writing a recipe, I ſhould have poſitively taken for a French man of faſhion, or a figure-dancer at the theatre.</p>
                  <p>WHEN I was juſt going away, Sir Thomas's nephew, who has been lately called to the bar, came in from Weſtminſter in his gown and tye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig; well, ſays I to myſelf, thank heaven here is one man who is not aſhamed of appearing in character. But the young gentleman was not ſeated above three minutes before he pulled off his wig in the preſence of the whole company, and ſhewed as ſmart a head of hair in the tyburn taſte as could be found within the bills of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. — I ſtared, and ſaw the uncle was not a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0136400201:227"/>
little diverted with my aſtoniſhment; he thought the transformation a very capital circumſtance, and ſeemed proud of a nephew who could alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately put on the gravity of the council, and the pertneſs of the footman. I was, however, diſguſted extremely, and took my leave, heartily convinced that nothing but a very great weakneſs of the mind could occaſion ſo many improprieties in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment of the perſon.</p>

               <p>IT was a cuſtomary anſwer with the celebrated Dean Swift, when any body aſked his opinion of a great man, "Stay till I ſee him in diſtreſs;" for my own part, though I think the reply ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general ſenſe of the world, extremely ſignificant, yet I can by no means imagine, that diſtreſs is the true touchſtone of fortitude: ſo far on the contrary, it has been my poſitive belief for a long time, that he who can beſt ſtand the ſhock, as I may ſay, of proſperity, gives the beſt proof of an even mind, and ſhews the firmeſt ſtability of ſoul, notwithſtanding what has been ſaid by our moſt celebrated philoſophers on the other ſide of the queſtion. Adverſity has been juſtly called the ſchool of wiſdom by a variety of writers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing which is ſo expeditious in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0136400201:228"/>
bringing a man to a knowledge of himſelf. When reduced to a narrowneſs of circumſtances, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the anxieties of a ſick bed, the mind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally turns her eye on thoſe objects which are moſt likely to afford her conſolation and relief. Religion in a moment tells her the uncertainty of all human expectations, and bids her depend alone on thoſe bliſsful aſſurances of happineſs in another world, which experience has convinced her are ſo extremely precarious in this: hence ſhe learns a proper mode of thinking, ſhews an implicit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the correcting hand of Providence, and becomes perfectly acquainted with what is due to others, from a juſt ſenſibility of what is neceſſary for herſelf.</p>
               <p>PROSPERITY on the other hand may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſchool of ſelf-ſufficience and the almoſt perpetual parent of pride. Whenever the ſun of proſperity ſheds a ray upon mankind, they are apt to grow important in their own opinions, and to think rather contemptibly of thoſe very people who were formerly on the liſt of their intimate friends; the goodneſs of the Deity they imagine to be the conſequence of particular merit, and look upon that as the reſult of their own immediate ſagacity, which is nothing but the unbounded benignity of their God. For theſe reaſons, therefore, I cannot help imagining, but what true fortitude or equanimity is beſt ſeen in proſperity. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the tranquility of a Socrates going to die, but are raviſhed with the unſwelling moderation
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0136400201:229"/>
of a Caeſar, when maſter of an empire, and ſtill retaining all the complacency of a private citizen.</p>
               <p>I AM naturally led into theſe reflexions by a viſit which I paid the other morning to my old friend Ned Blaze, to congratulate him on an eſtate of three thouſand pounds a year, which lately fell into his poſſeſſion by the will of an uncle, who good-naturedly left him every thing at his death, but who, while living, would not part with a ſix-penny piece to ſave him from deſtruction. Ned, for many years paſt has ſtruggled with all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a high ſpirit, a large family, and a very narrow fortune; ſometimes he has been obliged to ſtay at home for months, and at others has been months in jail: yet ſtill he kept up his reſolution with all the fortitude of a Stoic, and behaved with a degree of decency and manlineſs which procured him the univerſal eſteem, and not ſeldom the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal aſſiſtance of his acquaintance.</p>
               <p>AS I had always a regard for Ned, and if I may be excuſed the egotiſm, had proved this regard upon more occaſions than one , I was ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at his good fortune, and the moment I heard of it ſet out to tell him ſo. When I came to his houſe, inſtead of being inſtantly ſhewn up ſtairs by the maid, as had been the cuſtom former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a fellow with a bag to his hair, long ruffles, and a laced livery, deſired me, in broken Engliſh, to reſt myſelf in the parlour, and he would carry my name immediately to his maſter: well, I went into the parlour, ſat down, and amuſed myſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0136400201:230"/>
an hour with the elegant Eſſays of my worthy and ingenious friend, Dr. Goldſmith, which were accidentally lying in the window. My entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was too agreeable for me to think the time long, and I perhaps ſhould not have thought about it at all, if the clock had not alarmed me with the ſtroke of two. Surprized at this unexpected delay, I touched the bell, and aſked the ſervant if he had told his maſter of my being below; he replied in the affirmative, and added, that he would wait on me immediately.</p>
               <p>IN about a quarter of an hour I heard the dining room door opened, and was informed of Mr. Blaze's approach, by a ſlow, heavy, conſequential ſtamp on the ſtairs; the ſervant threw open the parlour door for him as he deſcended, and my friend entered with all the gravity and importance of a very great man. As I fancied he might think it neceſſary to aſſume this ſeriouſneſs of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, on ſuch an occaſion as the recent death of a near relation; I ran to him with my uſual free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, gave him a hearty ſhake by the hand, and ſaid, <q>Dear Ned, I am ſincerely rejoiced at this happy alteration in your circumſtances.</q> But I had no longer honeſt Ned Blaze to deal with, my familiarity I ſaw was infinitely diſguſting. Mr. Blaze ſtole his hand out of mine as ſoon as he could, and making me a low bow, replied, "Mr. Babler I thank you." We then ſat down, but our converſation loſt all that ſpirit and good-humour which we formerly thought it poſſeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0136400201:231"/>
Mr. Blaze's unlucky acquiſition of fortune; we were as ceremonious in an inſtant as if we had never ſeen each other before, and every obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the fineneſs of the weather was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and concluded with a Sir — of perfect good breeding and gentility. Mr. Blaze, however, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved to ſhew all his conſequence, rang, and enquired after the footmen by name, that I might judge the number of his domeſtics; he then order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one with a card to my Lord, and another with a compliment to his Grace, aſked if the goldſmith had ſent home the new ſervice of plate, or if the vis a vis was yet finiſhed at the coach makers. This converſation with the ſervant was kept up with as much indolence and tediouſneſs, as if no ſuch perſon as myſelf had been in the room; I therefore thought it but juſt to ſhew a proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reſentment, by immediately taking my leave; I did ſo, after receiving a cool invitation to dinner, and being told there was nothing provided but ten or a dozen things, and no company but the Earl of Sharpſet, and the Counteſs of Ombre. When I went home I thought this little narrative would make a tolerable paper, as it ſerved to rivet me in my belief, that the moſt difficult ſhock which any man can poſſibly ſtand, is that of proſperity.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THOUGH every body muſt allow the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a coquette to be truly deſpicable even among the women, yet when we find it in the other ſex, there is ſomething in it ſo unmanly, that we feel a deteſtation equal to our contempt; and look upon the object to be as much an enemy as he is a diſgrace to ſociety. To prove my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, Mr. Babler, give me leave to relate a circumſtance which lately happened in my own family; and which, if properly attended to, may be of real uſe to many of your fair readers.</p>
                  <p>I AM a merchant in the city, and have been above five years married to a moſt deſerving woman, who, as ſhe ſtudies every thing to promote my happineſs, obliges me to ſhew a grateful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility for the eſtabliſhment of her's; and even warms me with a continual wiſh of anticipating the moſt diſtant of her inclinations. About ſix months ago I took her younger ſiſter home, as I knew it would give her a ſatisfaction; intending to ſupply the loſs of a father lately deceaſed, and to omit no opportunity of advancing her fortune.</p>
                  <p>MY attention could not have been placed on a more deſerving object: Harriot, Sir, poſſeſſes every
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0136400201:233"/>
beauty of perſon, and every virtue of mind that can render her either beloved, or reſpected; and is in one word, as accompliſhed a young woman as any in the kingdom: her circumſtances beſides are no way inconſiderable; ſhe has ten thouſand pounds in the funds; and if ſhe marries to my liking, ſhall not want for a thouſand or two more — but that does not ſignify.</p>
                  <p>AMONG the number of people, who viſited at our houſe, Mr. Babler, the ſon of a very eminent citizen frequently obliged us with his company; a circumſtance that pleaſed me not a little, as he was far from a diſagreeable man; his perſon was remarkably genteel, and his face poſſeſſed of a more than ordinary degree of ſenſibility; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with much eaſe, was perfectly acquainted with men and things; and what rendered him a ſtill greater favourite, he ſung with an infinity of taſte; and played with a conſiderable ſhare of judgment on a variety of inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>THIS gentleman had not long commenced an intimacy in my family before he ſhewed a very viſible attachment for Harriot, hung upon every thing ſhe ſaid, and approved of every thing ſhe did; but at the ſame time ſeemed rather more ambitious to deſerve her eſteem, than to ſolicit it. This I naturally attributed to his modeſty, and it rather more confirmed me in the opinion which I entertained of his affection: had he treated her with the cuſtomary round of common place gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, I ſhould never have believed him ſerious;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0136400201:234"/>
but when I ſaw him aſſume a continual appearance of the moſt ſettled veneration and eſteem; when I ſaw him unremittingly ſtudious to catch the ſmalleſt opportunity of obliging, I was ſatisfied there was no affectation in the caſe, and convinced that every look was the ſpontaneous effuſion of his heart.</p>
                  <p>THE amiable Harriot unacquainted with art, ſuſpected none; and being of a temper the moſt generous herſelf, naturally entertained a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion of every body elſe; Mr. Selby in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular poſſeſſed the higheſt place in her regard; the winning ſoftneſs of his manners; the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon delicacy of his ſentiments; and his profound reſpect for her, to ſay nothing of his perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, all united to make an impreſſion on her boſom, and to inſpire her with the tendereſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a reciprocal love. She made her ſiſter her confident upon this occaſion about a week ago, and Maria very properly told the matter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to me. Finding Harriot's repoſe was ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concerned, I determined to give Mr. Selby a fair opportunity of declaring himſelf the next evening, that there might be no poſſibility of a miſtake in the caſe, and that my poor girl might be certain ſhe had a heart in exchange for her own. With this view I engaged him on a <hi>tete a tete</hi> party to Vauxhall, and while he was lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that my wife and ſiſter was not with us to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in the amuſement, I ſaid gaily, <q>Egad Tom I have a ſtrange notion that Harriot has
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0136400201:235"/>
done your buſineſs; you are eternally talking of her when ſhe's abſent, and as eternally lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing at her when ſhe's by: How is all this? come own, have I been right in my gueſs, and treat me with the confidence of a friend?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS queſtion quite diſconcerted him; he bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtammered, and, with a good deal of preſſing, at laſt drawled out, <q>That Miſs Harriot to be ſure was a moſt deſerving young lady, and that was he inclined to alter his condition, there was not a woman in the world he would be ſo proud of having for a wife. But tho' he was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of her merit, he had never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in any light but that of a friend, and was to the laſt degree concerned if any little aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the natural reſult of his eſteem, had once been miſinterpreted, and placed to a different account.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE whole affair was now out, the man's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was immediately before me; and tho' I could have ſacrificed him on the ſpot for the meanneſs and barbarity of his conduct, yet I bridled my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and would not indulge him with a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Harriot, by letting him ſee I conſidered his late declaration as a matter of any conſequence; I therefore aſſumed a gaiety which was quite a ſtranger to my heart, and replied, <q>I am exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively glad Tom to hear you talk in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: faith I was afraid all had been over with you; and my friendſhip for you was the only reaſon of my enquiry, as I ſhrewdly ſuſpect the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0136400201:236"/>
young baggage has already made a diſpoſal of her inclinations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>AFTER paſſing a joyleſs evening, we returned to town quite ſick of one another's company; and pretty confidently determined to have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for the future; when I had ſet Mr. Selby down, I went to Maria and told her how things had turned out, and deſired her to break them with all the delicacy ſhe was miſtreſs of to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſiſter; ſhe did ſo; but the ſhock is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove fatal. Harriot has ever ſince kept her bed, and for the three laſt days has been quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirous: ſhe raves continually on the villain who has murdered her peace of mind, and my ever-engaging Maria ſits rivetted to the bed-ſide as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually drenched in tears. In ſpite of all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to keep the matter private, the tattling of nurſes and ſervants has made it but too public, and denied us even the happineſs of being ſecretly miſerable. The moment I heard it talked of, I called upon Mr. Selby and demanded ſatisfaction; but could I expect a man to be brave who was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of acting ſuch a part as his to a woman of honour and virtue? No, Sir, he called his ſervants about me in his own houſe, and after my departure went and ſwore the peace before a magiſtrate. This is the only method which I have now left to puniſh him, and the only one alſo of exhorting parents and guardians to require an inſtant expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from any man who ſeems remarkably aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous

               <p>COQUETRY, or a paſſion for exerciſing the moſt unlimited authority of affectation or caprice on a lover, is a foible which renders the ladies ſo extremely ridiculous in the opinion of the world, that it is aſtoniſhing how ſuch a number of the fair-ſex can poſſibly give into it; and for the mere ſake of making another uneaſy, become abſolutely contemptible themſelves. Abſtracted, however, from the ridicule to which ſuch a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is always expoſed, there is a degree of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cruelty in the compoſition of a coquette, which throws the greateſt reflexion imaginable upon the benevolence of a lady's temper; and does not more depreciate the goodneſs of her heart, than leſſen the opinion we might entertain of her underſtanding. To delight in rendering a worthy man wretched, for the ſake of ſhewing a little power, is ſurely what the giddieſt creature in the univerſe muſt condemn upon a moment's reflexion; and when ſhe moreover conſiders that his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs muſt always be proportioned to his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0136400201:238"/>
for her, gratitude, as well as humanity, muſt ſhew her behaviour in a very culpable light, and tell her, that every pang which ſhe lodges in his boſom, is an abſolute diſhonour to her own.</p>
               <p>THE generality of the ladies have a want of candor to anſwer for, which is too often a ſource of the ſevereſt anxiety to others, as well as a ſpring of the greateſt embarraſſment to themſelves: — Raviſhed with the enchanting breath of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they lend a greedy ear to the ardent language of proteſting love; though at the ſame time it is a thouſand to one but they look upon the lover with the moſt inſuperable contempt: hence, though they never intend to bleſs him with a riciprocal return, they never can prevail upon themſelves to give him a final diſcharge, and the poor man is, in all probability, kept dangling for two or three years, till either avarice or inclination; a large eſtate, or a red coat, makes a conqueſt of the heart, and (to uſe the emphatic words of the celebrated Doctor Young,)
<q>
                     <l>— Amply gives, though treated long amiſs,</l>
                     <l>The man of merit his revenge in this.</l>
                  </q>
For the honour of the ladies, however, I ſhall introduce a little narrative to the public obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, I hope, will ſerve as an example to my fair readers, and at the ſame time convince thoſe infidels who are averſe to believing any thing laudable of the ſex, that they are to the full as capable of the moſt exalted actions as ourſelves,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0136400201:239"/>
however we may erect the creſt upon the ſuperior dignity of manhood, or ſwell upon the acquired advantages of education and knowledge of the world.</p>
               <p>ABOUT ten years ago a gentleman of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able family in Ireland, whom I ſhall diſtinguiſh by the name of Butler, being over on an excurſion to this metropolis, he accidentally dined at a friend's houſe in Pall-mall, where he fell paſſionately in love with a young lady, whom I muſt be equally free in concealing under the name of Lambton.</p>
               <p>MR. Butler communicated his ſentiments to his friend, who happened to be a relation of Miſs Lambton's, and requeſted his good offices with the lady. — The friend, who knew Mr. Butler to be a moſt deſerving young fellow, and was ſenſible that in point of birth and fortune he had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantages over his fair relation, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at the propoſal, and, communicating it to her father next morning, poor Miſs Lambton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived poſitive orders to prepare for Mr. Butler's viſit that very afternoon.</p>
               <p>MR. Butler came dreſſed, and a finer figure perhaps was not to be found within the Bills of Mortality; he wanted but half an inch of ſix foot, and was made in a manner remarkably manly, without running into any thing unweildily clumſy, or awkwardly robuſt: his face was diſtinguiſhed with a ſet of ſtrong marking lines; each feature, to uſe the poet's expreſſion, <q>was expanded with ſoul,</q> and breathed the inexpreſſible ſomewhat

which diſcovers the man of faſhion at the firſt glance; add to this, that there was ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly intereſting in his very tone of voice, which no leſs engaged the general attention, than commanded the univerſal reſpect: he came in a ſuit of pompadour velvet, richly embroidered with ſilver, and ſeemed as well calculated, in fact, to ſucceed with a fine lady, as the moſt celebrated of his countrymen.</p>
               <p>BEING left deſignedly alone with Miſs Lambton after tea time, he began in a very ſenſible and polite manner to make a declaration of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but had ſcarcely uttered a ſentence, when the young lady interrupted him, and begged his attention for a few words; he made a low bow; and ſhe addreſſed him to the following purport: <q>I am but too apprehenſive, Sir, on what account I am honoured with this viſit; my father, this morning, made me acquainted with your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in my favour; and, to be candid, from the little I have ſeen of you, I do not know a man in the world, was my heart diſengaged, who ſhould ſooner command a place in my eſteem: But, Sir, it is impoſſible for me ever to return your ſentiments as you could wiſh; my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have for a conſiderable time been engroſſed by a gentleman whom I have been many years acquainted with; and I ſhould think it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable injury to his tenderneſs, as well as to your worth, was I to keep this circumſtance a moment from your knowledge, after you have
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0136400201:241"/>
indicated the ſmalleſt degree of a particular reſpect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is eaſy to gueſs Mr. Butler's aſtoniſhment during this ſpeech; he bluſhed exceſſively, played with his ruffles, and gave no other interruption than a <hi>Madam</hi> or two, pronounced with the ſtrongeſt emphaſis of ſurprize: Miſs Lambton ſeizing the opportunity which his ſilence afforded, thought it beſt to diſemboſem herſelf entirely, and thus went on:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>FROM the opinion which I entertain of your generoſity, Mr. Butler, I flatter myſelf you will not uſe my father's authority, to tear me from the only man I ever can be happy with; nor make any attempts to gain a hand, which, on account of my prior attachment, can never be worthy of yours. Let me conjure you, therefore, dear Sir, to decline your addreſſes; and if you can have the additional goodneſs to give ſuch a meaſure any motive but this declaration; through my whole life I ſhall be bound to wiſh you that felicity with ſome more deſerving woman, which it is utterly impoſſible you ſhould ever enjoy with me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I WILL not treſpaſs upon the reader's patience with an account of what further paſſed upon this occaſion: ſuffice it, however, that Mr. Butler not only diſcontinued his addreſſes from that minute, but intereſted himſelf ſo effectually in favour of Miſs Lambton, and her lover Mr. Seymour, that old Mr. Lambton gave his conſent
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0136400201:242"/>
to their marriage, and Mr. Butler himſelf ſtood godfather to a fine boy about ten months after.</p>
               <p>IN the courſe of a few years, Mr. Seymour, by ſome lucky hits, accumulated a prodigious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and died, leaving the ſum of thirty thouſand pounds at the ſole diſpoſal of his lady; the reſt he divided among his children. Mrs. Seymour, whoſe affection for her huſband was uncommonly tender, did not long ſurvive ſo great a loſs; ſhe fell into a languiſhing diſorder that carried her off in about eighteen months, univerſally regretted by all who had the pleaſure of her acquaintance: a little before her deceaſe, however, ſhe made a ſtrict enquiry after Mr. Butler, of whom ſhe had not heard a ſyllable for the ſpace of ſeven years; ſhe at laſt found out that he had retired to the ſouth of France upon an annuity of a hundred pounds, his fine eſtate having been entirely deſtroyed, chiefly through the perfidy of his younger brother, for whom he had been bound in immenſe ſums, and ſeveral ineffectual ſchemes to retrieve the ſhattered ſituation of his affairs.</p>
               <p>THE generous heart of Mrs. Seymour over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with pity at his diſtreſs; his exalted conduct in relation to her and Mr. Seymour, ruſhed at once upon her recollection, and in her will, which ſhe ordered to be made without delay, ſhe inſerted this particular clauſe with her her own hand: <q>I give and bequeath to the Hon. Charles Butler, the ſum of ten thouſand pounds, on account of his great generoſity in withdrawing his addreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when I was unmarried, and uſing his good offices towards my union with my dear Mr. Seymour.</q>

               <p>THIS legacy was paid immediately after Mrs. Seymour's deceaſe, and the ſtory was laſt night told me by a gentleman of undoubted veracity, who received it himſelf from Mr. Butler.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AS you have kindly taken the poor Women under your protection, give me leave to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, through your much-admired paper, of two young fellows, relations of my own indeed, who conſtantly viſit at our houſe: the firſt, Sir, is a Templar, lately called to the bar, who thinks the eſſence of every thing, either amiable or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, is entirely confined to his profeſſion, and is continually teazing us with pleas, replications, rejoinders, and demurrers: The other is poſſeſſed of an independant fortune, and is what the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking part of the world calls a man of the town, a perſon of great humour, and a keen ſenſible fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>AS there are three or four girls of us generally together, and both Mr. Brief and Mr. Brazen are men of profeſſed gallantry, they are always ſure of joining us at the tea-table, to make the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0136400201:244"/>
play of their reſpective abilities: yet, inſtead of converſing upon thoſe topics, which we can chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully join in, they talk continually on thoſe ſubjects which are either totally impoſſible or utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for us to underſtand. My couſin Brief retails all the cauſes that are determined in Weſtminſter-hall, with the moſt inſufferable minuteneſs and inſipidity; and, after he has taken up our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for two hours together, looks round with an air of ſuch prodigious importance, that I have been often more provoked at this conſequential demand of our approbation for fatiguing us with his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, than even with the impertinence it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though nothing can be ſo diſguſting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and abſurd.</p>
                  <p>BUT what, if poſſible, aggravates the error in this worthy couſin of mine, is a cuſtom which he has of putting caſes to us, and aſking us the meaning of Subpaena, Latitat, Capias, Certiorari, and a thouſand other technical terms in the law, which he conſiders as matters of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and then, Sir, when he has entirely nonpluſſed us, you would laugh to ſee how he plumes himſelf upon the triumph he has acquired, and with how ſignificant a wink he looks round on his friend Mr. Brazen, as much as to bid him obſerve what a deſpicable figure he has made of the fooliſh giddy-headed girls of the company.</p>
                  <p>MR. BRAZEN does not indeed take Mr. Brief's method of deſtroying our patience, or inſulting our underſtandings, with what we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0136400201:245"/>
for, on the contrary, Sir, he piques him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon being a remarkably plain ſpeaker, and will not heſitate to pronounce the moſt apparent indelicacies in the moſt offenſive words: he looks upon it as frankneſs to be groſs, and thinks it a certain ſign of wit to be unpardonably rude and unmannerly. He told my ſiſter Sally, no later than yeſterday, that ſhe was an ignorant little puſs; and when I took him up for the familiarity, laughed directly in my face, and ſaid I had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious deal of impudence. Then, Sir, he ſwears ſo horridly, he terrifies us to death; and ſcarcely mentions any thing without one of theſe ſhocking execrations. From an opinion that indelicacy is a ſign of great ſenſe, and a belief that it is very ſpirited to be blaſphemous, he is continually ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his parts at the expence of common decency, and always making a parade of his courage, by flying in the face of his God! Many is the time, Sir, he has ſent me ſinking with ſhame out of the room, and made me ſhudder with the earneſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation of ſome new-invented oath, which he has picked up in the licentious circle of his miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>I AM the more concerned, Mr. Babler, for this culpable conduct in my two couſins, becauſe they are both very honeſt, well-meaning, young fellows, and are far from being deſtitute either of real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence or true generoſity. I wiſh, therefore, Sir, you would tell them that nothing can be a greater inſult to a woman's underſtanding, than to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0136400201:246"/>
converſe with her about matters with which it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould be acquainted; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be a groſſer affront to the rectitude of her heart, than the iliberal practice of thoſe inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies and execrations which are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the moſt profligate of her ſex.</p>
                  <p>I AM far, very far, Mr. Babler, from preaching up an unneceſſary preciſeneſs or ſeverity of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; on the contrary, I think freedom, while it is confined within the limits of good-breeding, one of the moſt amiable eſſentials to the pleaſure of every rational company: But, Sir, where this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom infringes ſo far upon the bounds of politeneſs, that a woman is either treated as an idiot, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing infinitely worſe; that moment I think the man is entitled to the heavieſt cenſure, who forgets the dignity of her ſex, and acts as if ſhe was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unworthy either of ſenſible converſe, or common civility.</p>
                  <p>YOU men, Mr. Babler, are in general very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon the women; you laugh at us for talking about our caps, our ribbands, or our lap-dogs; I would adviſe your lordly ſex, however, to look at home; and before they think of plucking the mote out of our eyes, to be pretty certain there are no beams in their own.</p>

               <p>AS my fair correſpondent Amanda's letter, inſerted in my laſt paper, has given, I am told, a general ſatisfaction, it will not, I hope, be diſagreeable to my readers, if I reſume the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, eſpecially as I want to introduce a little jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to their obſervation, which was lately preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me with the papers of a deceaſed man of quality, who was unhappily a man of gallantry alſo; and indulged a licentiouſneſs of thinking, in ſome caſes, that reflected no great honour either upon his humanity or underſtanding.</p>
               <p>I HAVE frequently remarked what a degree of nicety is requiſite in the education of young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and delivered it as my opinion, that thoſe parents were very fortunate, who, from the ſex of their children, had none of the various conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to apprehend, which the leaſt indiſcretion in the ladies is conſtantly ſure of bringing on a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. I have ſaid that the ſame levity of conduct which would ſteep a woman in the groſſeſt lees of infamy, is entirely over looked, if not publicly approved, in a man; and that the mere circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſex gives him a kind of privilege to practiſe a number of irregularities, that would render an uncultivated female the ſcandal of ſociety.</p>
               <p>BUT at the ſame time that the depravity of cuſtom has given this unhappy ſuperiority to the men; at
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0136400201:248"/>
the time that our lordly ſex is inveſted by the world with a preſcriptive title of violating the moſt ſacred of the divine ordinances, neither reaſon nor religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has given us the leaſt exemption from undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that dreadful examination in another life, which is ſo fatally diſregarded in this. When we ſee the moſt triumphant libertine in his moments of illneſs, or his hours of reflexion, it is then we find that this boaſted right of doing wrong is nothing more than a glittering gewgaw that leads us into a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ought to be lamented as the greateſt of all misfortunes, inſtead of being conſidered as a matter of conſolation, or looked upon with an eye of appetite or joy. To ſpeak in the language of the poet;

                  </opener>
                  <p>I HERE ſend you a remark or two upon a very celebrated performance, which in its particular walk of genius, has been mentioned as a maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; and poſſibly produced more imitators than any other poem in this age and kingdom; I need ſcarcely tell you, Mr. Babler, that this piece is, "Gray's elegy in a country church-yard:" A piece, Sir, which though I much admire, I can by no means imagine to be ſo extremely perfect a work, as it has been generally conſidered; and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are ſome of the reaſons why I differ from the public opinion in this reſpect:</p>
                  <p>THE very firſt line, Sir, which begins this elegy, is an unſucceſsful attempt at metaphor, palpably repugnant to the rules of poetry and univerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <q>The Curfeu tolls the knell of parting day,</q>
                  <p>VISIBLY alluding to the ringing of a bell at the death of ſome-body. The author ſhould have recollected, however, that this bell is never rung till ſomebody is actually dead; and that therefore, the term <hi>parting</hi> is conſequently a falſe metaphor; had he ſaid indeed, that
<q>The Curfeu tolls the knell of <hi>parted</hi> day,</q>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0136400201:253"/>
There could be no poſſibility of objection, but <hi>parting</hi> is every whit as incongruous here as it would be in real life to toll a paſſing bell for a man, before he had poſitively given up the ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>IN the courſe of the reflective part, we come to the following ſtanzas:

The author in the very moment that he intended to laſh Cromwell with the greateſt ſeverity, introduces him in the ſame company with Hampden and Milton, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

                  <p>IT is odd that a <hi>noble</hi> rage ſhould ever be a <hi>guilty</hi> one, and ſomewhat ſurprizing, that a perſon of our author's extenſive abilities, could find no happier mode of conveying his cenſure and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe: indeed in the two ſubſequent ſtanzas, he has endeavoured to explain himſelf a little; but as Lady Townly aptly expreſſes it, it is nothing more than darning an old ruffle to make it the worſe for mending.</p>

                  <p>HERE, Mr. Babler, in the ſecond line of the laſt ſtanza, Cromwell is allowed his ſhare of virtue as well as Hampden or Milton; and they, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun plural <hi>their,</hi> are dragged in for their ſhare of vices as well as that celebrated uſurper: ſo that upon the whole, though we gueſs the author's meaning well enough, the ſtanzas are nevertheleſs a ſtrange huddle of inconſiſtency, and not a little injurious to the perſpicuity of their elegant author.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0136400201:255"/>In the epitaph we are told,
<q>
                        <l>Here reſts his head upon the lap of earth,</l>
                        <l>A youth to fortune and to fame unknown,</l>
                        <l>Fair ſcience frown'd not on his humble birth</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>NOW for my own part, I can by no means ſee any merit in being marked out by melancholy for her own, though the conjunction <hi>"And,"</hi> at the beginning of the laſt line ſeems to hint pretty ſtrongly, that melancholy is a neceſſary concomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of ſcience. I ſhall be bold enough to affirm, that if the word <hi>"But"</hi> was ſubſtituted for <hi>"And,"</hi> the reading would be much improved, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a much ſtronger idea of tenderneſs, than what can poſſibly be excited by the preſent word. The Epitaph was written on purpoſe to ſpread a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through the mind of the reader; but the word <hi>"And,"</hi> making it as I ſaid before, a matter of merit to be melancholy, the paſſage naturally fails of it's intended effect; whereas had it been thus,
<q>
                        <l>Fair ſcience frown'd not on his humble birth,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>But</hi> melancholy mark'd him for her own,</l>
                     </q>
We ſhould have then lamented, that a worthy youth, enriched with the gifts of ſcience, had the ſmalleſt reaſon for deſpondency, and ſhed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tear in ſympathy with his misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>THE laſt ſtanza, in my opinion, is either extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed, or extremely indefenſible.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>No farther ſeek his merits to diſcloſe,</l>

                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0136400201:256"/>THIS ſtanza, if it has any meaning at all, can mean nothing but this: <q>That it is improper to examine either the merits or frailties of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deceaſed, ſince they are both alike repoſed in one dread abode, the boſom of his father and his God.</q> This is the firſt time I ever heard of a human creature making the boſom of his Deity a repoſitory for his errors; and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, I think the fault ſtill more inexcuſable, becauſe the violence offered to reaſon and religion, has no way aſſiſted the poetry, this being perhaps as lame a paſſage as any in the whole piece.</p>
                  <p>FROM the foregoing curſory hints which I have thrown out with no ill-natured deſign, Mr. Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, I hope your readers will ſee, there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of diſcovering motes in the ſun, and be a little cautious for the future, how they mention any thing as the criterion of merit, without firſt of all making a candid enquiry, to ſee whether it has not ſome imperfections.</p>

               <p>MY nephew Harry called on me this morning, and mentioned one of my papers which was prodigiouſly commended by ſeveral of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, particularly by Miſs Cornelia Marchmont, who deſired him, in very ſtrong terms, to give me her
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0136400201:257"/>
compliments for the maſterly rules which I had there laid down for the ſervice of the ladies. I don't known how it was, but I received a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſhare of ſatisfaction from this compliment. Miſs Marchmont is a young lady of twenty-one, miſtreſs of every polite accompliſhment, and every ſhining virtue; and carries in an exquiſite ſweetneſs of countenance, the moſt expreſſive indications of her fine underſtanding, and her excellent heart. My young rogue has, I fancy a month's mind to her; and if I am at all acquainted with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the eyes, Cornelia is no way diſpleaſed at that circumſtance. Harry as yet has told me nothing, but I believe it will be a match; if it ſhould, I intend taking up my reſidence with them for the remainder of my days, and ſhall leave my little all to them and their children.</p>
               <p>THE reader may poſſibly ſuſpect, that I am more than commonly ſenſible of this young lady's merit, through a principle of vanity for the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering encomium with which ſhe has favoured my productions. I ſhall candidly acknowledge, that it made me ſomewhat vain, but I hope I ſhall be alſo believed, when I ſay, her complaiſance no way enhanced my opinion of her accompliſhments: and now I am talking of vanity, I cannot help obſerving, how univerſally ſubject the human mind is to the attacks of this dangerous enemy; for my own part, though an old fellow, when I have written any thing which I conceive may be uſeful, worthy,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0136400201:258"/>
or done any thing which I fancy may be praiſe worthy, I ſtrut alone in my ſtudy with a degree of conſequence ſcarcely credible; till recollecting how ridiculous a figure I make in the eye of my own examination, I bluſh at my ſelf-ſufficienc, and immediately turn my thoughts upon ſome object which can be conſidered with a greater ſhare of credit, both to my modeſty and my underſtanding, — But to return —</p>
               <p>IN the courſe of Harry's converſation with me, he ſaid, that Miſs Marchmont had given him a letter for the uſe of the Babler, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted might be inſerted in the preſent number. This letter, ſays Harry, ſhe lately wrote in anſwer to a very paſſionate epiſtle from a young fellow who has a company in the guards; and who, thinking her to be like the generality of the ſex, imagined a few fine expreſſions and a red coat were ſufficient to render her inſenſible to all the duties which ſhe owed to herſelf and her family.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE juſt this moment received a letter from you in ſo very extraordinary a ſtile, that ſhould I heſitate an inſtant to anſwer it, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of my own heart might be called into queſtion, or I might at leaſt be ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to encourage your wiſhes, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a tacit approbation: to prevent the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0136400201:259"/>
poſſibility of this alternative, I muſt take the liberty of examining your ſentiments pretty cloſely; and I flatter myſelf, that for your own ſakes you will pay ſome little attention to the following arguments, lightly ſoever as you might be led to conſider them through any ſolicitude for mine.</p>
                     <p>YOU ſet out with ſaying, how tender an affection you have conceived for me, and what a very high opinion you entertain both of my heart and my underſtanding: — Upon my word, Sir, you have an uncommon ſhare of penetration, for you were never in my company above half an hour in your days, and during that time you yourſelf made ſo conſpicuous a figure in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that I had not an opportunity of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twenty ſyllables: to be ſure your ſubſequent entreaty is rather unhappy, when my amazing qualifications come to be conſidered; for the proof you deſire me to give of a good diſpoſition, is to violate all the dignity and decorum of my ſex, by entering into a correſpondence with an abſolute ſtranger; and the teſtimony you want of my good ſenſe, is to keep your delicate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of love from the knowledge of the only people in the world to whom it ought to be firſt of all revealed — my father and the reſt of my family.</p>
                     <p>IN the name of wonder, Sir, who are you, that you ſhould preſume to think me capable either of ſuch a meanneſs or ſuch an abſurdity.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0136400201:260"/>
What mighty merit are you poſſeſſed of, that you ſhould imagine half a dozen lines are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enough to deſtroy all the principles which I have been imbibing for the courſe of a whole life; or what extraordinary obligations have you conferred upon me, that I muſt, in an inſtant, ſacrifice my own peace, and the tranquility of my family, for no other end, but that of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your inclinations?</p>
                     <p>O BUT you love me, and therefore gratitude ſhould oblige me to return you a favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: admitting the poſſibility even of ſuch a circumſtance; pray, Sir, let me aſk you for whoſe ſake do you love me, mine or your own? If it be for your own, of courſe I am under no manner of obligation: and if it ſhould turn out, as I am very much inclined to believe, that you do not love me, can th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe fine ſpeeches of yours, do you imagine, protect you from my honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and contempt? Surely, if your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions were of a nature that merited any body's encouragement, there could be no occaſion for this ſiniſter method of urging them. But I ſee through your ridiculous drift, Sir; you are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive that your fulſome declaration of a paſſion, will charm me into an utter diſregard for the ſentiments of honour and filial affection; and render my conſummate wiſdomſhip totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of acting with the leaſt degree of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or common underſtanding.</p>

                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0136400201:261"/>O BUT you mean honourably, and aſpire at the happineſs of my hand! a pretty method you take indeed of ſoliciting my good opinion, by ſuppoſing me not only an undutiful daughter, but an abſolute fool: be aſſured, Sir, if I ever alter my condition, a father's approbation muſt firſt of all countenance my choice; and a perfect acquaintance with my lover's temper and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples confirm it. But to put an end at once to your ſolicitations, give me leave to inform you, that it is by my father's command I write this letter; and that the diſingenuous part you have acted on the preſent occaſion, renders it utterly impoſſible for you ever to obtain a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſentiment either from him or from</p>

                  <p>I AM a conſtant reader of your paper, and am very often entertained with the eaſy and familiar manner in which, to uſe my lord Bacon's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <q>you bring home things to men's buſineſs and boſoms.</q> Some time ago I remember my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf particularly ſtruck with the journal of a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and thought it an excellent way of laſhing the vices of our men of gallantry, who claim an indiſputable right of deſtroying the happineſs of every family into which they are admitted. The mode of journalizing brought to my remembrance a little paper which I had written myſelf about ſeven years ago, and called the <q>journal of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</q> At that time, Mr. Babler, ſome youthful indiſcretions deprived me of a father's protection, and I was reduced to the moſt miſerable of all diſtreſſes, that of writing for bread; but whether I had too much pride or too little merit, or both, I ſhall not take upon me to ſay; but my ſituation affected me ſo much, that I once drew up the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtate of it for a week, and thought of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting it in a magazine with which I happened to be connected. The printer, however, refuſed it a place, and my father becoming reconciled to me in a little time after, it has ſince lain by, and is now at your ſervice for publication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0136400201:263"/>MONDAY morning—roſe at ſeven to write an eaſtern tale againſt eight—finiſhed it in time, but going down ſtairs, the maid who came up to light the fire, thruſt it in the grate, and conſumed what was to maintain me for the whole day—being net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, I ſpoke in pretty ſevere terms about her neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, when unluckily, her miſtreſs, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be coming up ſtairs, told me, I ſhould wake Mr. Fuſtian, the actor, who lived in the two pair of ſtairs room under me; and deſired I would think of getting her ſome money, for I was no leſs than a fortnight in arrear—ſilenced—and ſat down to perform my taſk a ſecond time, but the printer coming for copy, and being chagrined at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, ſome words enſued between us, and he ſwore to look out directly for another hand.</p>
                  <p>THREE o'clock — too proud to make an apology to Mr. Type — I ſauntered to the Park, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally fell into chat with a young fellow on one of the ſeats — in the courſe of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I learned that he was a writer too—ſo gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his buſineſs in the Park to be much the ſame with my own — I took my leave of him for fear of entering into any diſagreeable explanation in regard to circumſtances — eight o'clok, got ſixpence upon my clean ſhirt at the pawnbroker's — and dined upon a mutton chop and a pint of beer at the Black Lyon in Ruſſel-ſtreet — An unexpected mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune—upon coming to pay my reckoning, found the ſix-pence had ſlipped through a hole in my pocket, which I had never before diſcovered — in

the utmoſt confuſion—inſulted before the whole company by the waiter, with the aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of hearing ſeveral infamous jeſts upon my black coat—relieved at laſt by the humanity of the landlord, who happened to overhear the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—threatened to turn the waiter off for his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence—and calling me out of the room—ſlipped half a guinea in my hand—but when I was going about to thank him, turned away, and pulling out his handkerchief, complained of very ſore eyes.</p>
                  <p>TUESDAY paid my landlady three ſhillings for her fortnight's lodging — redeemed my ſhirt—and bought a pair of breeches for three and ſix-pence, at a cellar in Monmouth-ſtreet—lived very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably on eighteen-pence this day and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>THURSDAY—called upon by a printer, who wanted me to write ſomething on the plan of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Mulier Voluptatis — aſſuring me, it would have a prodigious ſale—declined his offer—talked to about aſſiſting in a commentary on the Bible, and offered five ſhillings a week for every number of my notes—accepted the propoſal—having no other proſpect of exiſtence—proceeded immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the taſk—and finiſhed a number, to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable diſgrace, in a night cellar that very even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>FRIDAY—Mr. Compoſe came for copy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon my taking a pint of purl with him at the cat and bagpipes—advanced me half a guinea upon account, and paſſed his word to a civil well-looking
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0136400201:265"/>
man, one Mr. Heelpiece, with whom he happened to be in company, for a pair of ſhoes— charm'd with his good-nature, I made him a preſent of four odes, which he was kind enough to praiſe prodigiouſly, and which I had afterwards the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of hearing he ſold for a couple of guineas to a bookſeller in the Row.</p>

               <p>GREATLY as the degeneracy of the preſent age may be talked of, or highly ſoever as we may imagine the people of antient times to ſurpaſs us either in morality or underſtanding; I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs perfectly ſatisfied that there is as much good ſenſe, and as much real virtue to be met with in our own days as ever was found in the days of our forefathers, notwithſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ding the meritorious cobwebs of antiquity have happily concealed a number of their follies and their faults, and thrown a friendly veil of oblivion over no inconſiderable ſhare of their imperfections.</p>
               <p>THE writers of the preſent times are not indeed burthened with the monſtrous affectation which was ſo commonly met with among the philoſophers of antiquity, and therefore are probably held in a leſs conſequential light, both with regard to their principles and their abilities; this, however, if properly conſidered, is one reaſon why they may have a greater ſhare of the latter, though it does not in the remoteſt manner inſinuate an inference
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0136400201:267"/>
of their being any way inferior in the firſt. Many of the antient Sages owed the greateſt part of their reputation to circumſtances which would entitle a modern to a dark room and a truſs of ſtraw, or excite the general contempt at leaſt againſt his folly and impertinence: What would we think of a philoſopher now-a-days, if inſtead of arguing the world by the force of ſound reaſoning out of their vices and abſurdities, he ſhould be in continual tears about the former, and in a perpetual fit of laughing at the laſt? What would we ſay to any moraliſt who would ſearch the public ſtreets at noon with a candle and lanthorn, and tell every body he met, that he was endeavouring to find an honeſt man? Or what would we ſay to a Cynic, who by way of exhorting his countrymen againſt the allurements of luxury, would make uſe of no other perſuaſives than bidding a total adieu to every ſocial enjoyment, and taking up his reſidence in a tub?</p>
               <p>THE writers of a later date look with a juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain upon ſuch deſpicable inſtances of affectation, and do not addreſs themſelves to the weakneſs, but to the underſtanding of their countrymen: it is not the paſſions which they want to work upon, but the underſtanding which they want to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and are infinitely more ſolicitous to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a reſpectable opinion of their judgment and their integrity, than ambitious to purchaſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality by the practiſe of any illuſtrious abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which however it may dazzle a moment upon
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0136400201:268"/>
the imagination, the cooler reflections of reaſon muſt conſider with the moſt inſuperable contempt. Far be it from me to pluck the ſmalleſt bay from the brow of antiquity; I ſincerely venerate many leſſons inculcated by ſeveral of the philoſophers; but at the ſame time I cannot be totally inſenſible to the imperfections of their times, or palpably blind to the merits of our own: for this reaſon I muſt ſtand up for the character of modern under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and declare it as my opinion, that I think no two philoſophers in the whole compaſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity have ſurpaſſed Bacon and Newton, either in the extent or importance of their works; and however I may incur the cenſure of claſſical readers, I will go farther, and venture to aſſert, that Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear and Milton are poets of as much excellence as either Homer or Virgil; and poſſibly if the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh language was but half ſo univerſally ſtudied as the Greek or Latin, I ſhould find thouſands who would not heſitate to give a more exalted forum of reputation to the two illuſtrious moderns, than to the two celebrated names of antiquity, who have for ſo many ages been conſidered as a ſort of <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> to human genius, in every performance of a poetical tendency.</p>
               <p>HAVING ſaid thus much in defence of modern underſtanding, I ſhall ſay a few words in ſupport of modern virtue againſt the heavy accuſations of degeneracy, which ſome inconſiderate writers are but too apt to lay at our door, and but too ready to faſten on the credulity of the public.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0136400201:269"/>IT muſt be readily granted, that the hiſtory of modern times affords ſufficient inſtances of vices, which reduce human nature to the baſeſt of all levels, and throw the blackeſt ſtigma not only upon the dignity, but upon the very name of man: yet if we take a review of more diſtant ages, we ſhall find equal examples of rapine, perjury, and blood: The civilized ſtates of Greece produced as many ſcenes of ambition, tyranny, and murder, as can poſſibly be found among the moſt barbarous nations; and the virtuous Romans themſelves, at the very moment they were affecting an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſanctity of manners, were robbing all the world to inculcate maxims of juſtice, and cutting whole nations to pieces, to teach them leſſons of benevolence and humanity. Greece had it's Phillip and it's Alexander, if France had her Louis the XIVth; and Rome had her Caeſar, if England had her Cromwell ſhe alſo has a Caligula and a Nero to blacken everlaſtingly upon her annals, if ours are ſtigmatized with an arbitrary Charles, or a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted James: when I mention Louis the XIVth, I by no means deſign to compare him with Philip or Alexander in any thing but his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and his rapacity; they are in every other reſpect ſo infinitely the more exalted murderers, that the ſenſible reader will readily perceive in this reſpect, I intended a very limited parallel.</p>
               <p>SEEING therefore that the moſt celebrated of the antient eras cannot produce greater poets and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0136400201:270"/>
philoſophers than what appears upon the modern liſt; I ſhould be glad to aſk what reaſonable opinion can be aſſigned for our ſuppoſed depravity in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? And I ſhould be alſo glad to know how the charge of a depravity in manners can be ſupported, when upon a candid review of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient annals, they appear to be covered with at leaſt an equal ſhare of abſurdities and crimes: that the modern era is bad enough, we have too many lamentable teſtimonies; but there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to aggravate either our weakneſs or our guilt, by making us worſe than former times, which wherever we examine, were, in the general, a compound of the greateſt villains and the groſſeſt fools.</p>

               <p>WHEN the celebrated Voltaire was in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he paid a viſit to the famous Mr. Congreve, though he was utterly unacquainted with him, and with that happy violation of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which is the characteriſtic of elevated genius, introduced himſelf upon the mere account of their reſpective literary reputations. The Engliſhman was, however, diſconcerted, and inſtead of looking upon the frankneſs of Voltaire's behaviour as the greateſt compliment that could be paid him; he ſaid, he would be glad of being viſited by Mr. Voltaire as a private gentleman, but could not think of cultivating a friendſhip with any body,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0136400201:271"/>
barely on the account of being an author. The Frenchman, diſguſted at this untimely inſtance of affectation, turned upon his heel, and replied, with ſeverity, that had not Mr. Congreve been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than a private gentleman, he never would have ſuffered the trouble of that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</p>
               <p>THE ſlighteſt ſurvey of mankind will convince a rational enquirer, that the generality of people are influenced by as injudicious a principle in their actions, as Mr. Congreve in the preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. To avoid the imputation of one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, they inſenſibly run into another; and let the character be what it will which they are fearful of incurring, an exceſſive ſolicitude to avoid it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them frequently to one equally abſurd, and excites, while they imagine themſelves perfectly ſecure from ridicule or cenſure, the univerſal laugh or diſeſteem of their acquaintance. I am naturally led into theſe reflexions by a letter from a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent, whoſe favours I ſhall be always proud of receiving, and whoſe good opinion I ſhall always ſtudy to deſerve, while my leiſure and my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion allow me to ſcribble for the amuſement of the public.</p>

                  <p>THOUGH the world ſeldom holds any ſet of people in a more ridiculous light than your pretty delicate race of beings, who are unceaſingly

employed in the decoration of their perſons: yet for my own part, I think the eternal ſloven to the full as contemptible a character as the coxcomb profeſſed; nay, if poſſible, I conſider him as the worſt of the two, ſince though the latter may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke your mirth, he does not turn your ſtomach; and is at moſt but an object of laughter, without giving any occaſion for diſguſt. I lately ſpent a few weeks near Whitehaven, in Cumberland, Mr. Babler, where I had frequent opportunities of converſing with a very worthy Clergyman, who formerly was my ſchool-maſter, and who has as good a heart and as clear an underſtanding as any man in the kingdom. As we kept company on the moſt unreſerved terms of friendſhip, my powdered head of hair and white coat was a continual ſource of entertainment to him; and he would often call me a young coxcomb, if in walking through a wet field or a dirty road, I ſeemed to take the ſmalleſt pains about my ſtockings, or expreſſed a caſual wiſh that I had not come abroad without my boots. A very trifling concern about the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulating ſableneſs of a ſhirt, would procure me a lecture of half an hour, and a clean handkerchief once a day, was a piece of unpardonable foppery that merited the diſcipline of a horſewhip. In ſhort, Sir, being barely decent in my externals, was ſure of drawing an imputation upon the little ſhare of underſtanding I poſſeſs; and in proportion as I was tolerably dreſſed, I was certain of being told I had an intolerable degree of vanity.</p>

                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0136400201:275"/>THE good-humoured liberties thus taken with my appearance, I conſtantly retorted upon my reverend friend for running into the moſt diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able negligence imaginable. If my powdered head and ſmooth chin afforded him a laugh, I was no leſs merry with his antiquated grizzel and long beard; and for every ſarcaſm thrown out againſt my white cotton ſtockings, I never failed to be witty on his coarſe yarn ones, which through an abſolute piece of affectation; he continually wore half way about his heels. In this manner we uſed to joke when at a loſs for converſation; and it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally proved a matter of no little entertainment to the honeſt country people, to hear us rating one another ſo heartily.</p>
                  <p>THIS perpetual negligence in the appearance of my worthy friend, very often led me to reflect upon the motive which could induce ſo many people of excellent underſtandings to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely regardleſs of their perſons; and I never could imagine but what it was ſome ſtrange kind of vanity, which in general produced this unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſlovenlineſs, notwithſtanding to avoid every imputation of vanity, is the univerſal plea of all the ſlovens of my acquaintance: looking upon any remarkable attachment to dreſs, as a proof of a weak mind, your men of ſenſe affect to be entirely above it; and willing to enhance their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, by depending ſolely on the force of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual merit, they run to ſtudied indecencies of appearance; and very often carry not only a dirty
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0136400201:276"/>
ſhirt, but an unſavoury effluvia into the politeſt companies.</p>
                  <p>PEOPLE of ſenſe ſhould, however, conſider, that a cleanlineſs in dreſs is not a little conducive to health; and that it can be no derogation from their underſtandings, to make uſe of an occaſional baſon of water in the ſcowering of their hands and face: all extremes are an imputation upon our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the beſt proof which men of abilities can give of their ſuperior wiſdom on ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, is to avoid the ſmalleſt appearance of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. Wherever we ſee men running into ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of any kind, we may ſafely conclude, that the judgment is not perfectly right; but when we ſee theſe ſingularities have a tendency only to occaſion univerſal diſguſt, we may be ſatisfied, that whoever is guilty of them, is poſſeſſed of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſhare of pride at the bottom; and thinks that the accompliſhments of his mind ſufficiently attone for any egregious diſregard of his perſon.</p>
                  <p>EVERY man owes ſomething to the ſatisfaction of his friends, notwithſtanding ſo many people ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly imagine they are entirely formed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A philoſopher or a poet may challenge our admiration on the ſcore of his abilities; yet if he ſacrifices all conſideration to a decency in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it is impoſſible he ſhould ever be beloved. Converſe with him we may, but we can neither chooſe to ſit near him at table, nor pledge him out of the ſame glaſs; and however we may deſpiſe a coxcomb for his vanity and want of underſtanding,

               <p>THOUGH no man can be a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of Engliſh hoſpitality than myſelf. I have nevertheleſs been frequently offended at ſeeing this hoſpitality carried to a ridiculous exceſs; and have always imagined where I ſaw the maſter of a houſe running into a large expence merely for the entertainment of two or three intimate friends, that he muſt entertain either a very improper opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelf, or a ſtrange idea of his company.</p>
               <p>I DINED yeſterday with my old friend Ned Grumble, the council at Gray's-inn, with whom I went to ſchool, and who notwithſtanding the ſmart air which an occaſional queue wig gives him is at leaſt eight and fifty, and ought to know a little more of the world than what he manifeſted in his entertainment. There were but three of us, Ned, Dr. Syſtem the Naturaliſt, and myſelf, yet we had dinner enough from the tavern to ſerve twenty, and ſuch a profuſion of luxuries, that the bare eatables muſt at leaſt have amounted to ſix or ſeven pounds. To be ſure Ned is a man of fortune,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0136400201:278"/>
and can afford to treat his friends very genteelly, but for my own part I never form my notions of gentility by the ſtandard of extravagance. I don't love to ſee money unneceſſarily thrown away; and always wiſh that people of condition would apply the ſuperfluities of their income either to the relief of merit in diſtreſs, or to thoſe objects which muſt promote the general welfare of their country.</p>
               <p>As the various courſes came in, I obſerved Ned was ſecretly pleaſed with the air of ſurprize which I naturally put on, and ſeemed to riſe in his own opinion in proportion to the elegance of his table; with a look of indifference he preſſed the doctor and I to eat hearty; and with a very ridiculous kind of an affectation, lamented that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which we could poſſibly like. He wiſhed the dinner had been to our taſtes; and with the long liſt of cuſtomary excuſes which uſually paſs for good breeding in ſecond-rate companies, he promiſed the next time we favoured him with a viſit, we ſhould be accommodated in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more to our ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>WHEN I returned home I could not help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the pernicious prevalence of cuſtoms in the generality of our convivial entertainments. The eternal endeavour at parade and magnificence, I conſidered as the natural reſult of vanity; and ſaw, that by much the principal part of the world, was conſiderably more ſtudious to arrogate the opinion of their own importance, than to promote the ſatisfaction of their friends. Every diſh which
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0136400201:279"/>
was added to a table, I found was looked upon as an addition to the merit of the entertainer; and he that was a clever fellow with a Turbot, was ſtill clever if he could furniſh a John Dory, or provide any other article of luxury equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive and unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>If, however, we examine this matter properly we ſhall always find, that an exceſs of preparation, inſtead of being a real compliment, is nothing better than indirect offence; it is a tacit inſinuation either that our gueſts are not generaly uſed to ſuch delicacies as we have provided for them, or that it is abſolutely neceſſary to bribe the depravity of their pallates, when we would deſire the favour of their company. The great art of entertaining with elegance is to entertain with reaſon. To do this we muſt conſult the nature of our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the rank of our friends. If the firſt are narrow, we expoſe ourſelves to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt cenſure as well as the keeneſt ridicule, by aping the luxurious abundance of a Lord Mayor's table; and let the latter be what will, we ſhould endeavour to treat them after the cuſtomary manner in which they treat themſelves in their own families. For this reaſon we ſhould never inſult a poor man with all the magnificence of fifty covers, nor invite a lord to an humble ſhin of beef. A decent ſupply of good diſhes ſhould always be in readineſs, but nothing ever ſtudied for unneceſſary parade. Plenty and not profuſion ſhould be the characteriſtic of our board; and we ſhould conſtantly recollect that thoſe are utterly
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0136400201:280"/>
unworthy the appellation of friends, who could wiſh us to ſquander a parced of valuable pounds for the mere ſake of making an empty diſplay of our opulence, when the ſum thus extravagantly laid out, might be applied to a number of very ſalutary purpoſes.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſeveral people, however, who are hurried away by an unaccountable deſire of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing extremely ſplendid in their entertainments, and make it a ſort of point to keep a table conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably above their circumſtances. I remember poor dick Thornton would frequently invite peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to dinner, and treat with Champagne and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, though he borrowed the money which paid the bill of fare, but the evening before, from ſome of his gueſts, or pitifully begged a fortnight's credit at the Mitre in Fleet-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>HOSPITALITY to be ſure requires every man to receive his acquaintance with the utmoſt cordiality and warmth, but it by no means deſires people of ſmall fortune to be conſtantly impoveriſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the ſake of keeping an extenſive circuit of company; neither does it dictate, that thoſe with full purſes ſhould ever run into extravagance. None, however, miſtake the matter more than young fellows who are juſt entering in the world, and have no other proſpect of ſupporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than the ſucceſs of their reſpective avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Betrayed by too great a generoſity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they imagine they never can ſhew a ſufficient welcome to their friends; and hence they incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0136400201:281"/>
provide twenty or thirty diſhes for thoſe very men, whoſe general round of living they know to be a plain ſimple joint, or a frugal beef ſtake at a Tavern. For my own part, whenever it has been my lot to dine with perſons of this caſt, the uncommon excellence of my entertainment has entirely ſpoiled my ſtomach; and I have loſt all reliſh to eating, merely from recollecting what a conſiderable ſum a good-natured young fellow muſt have idly thrown away, through a deſire of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting an extraordinary reſpect for his company.</p>
               <p>THE publication of this little ſtricture, will, I hope, in ſome meaſure remove ſo great an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.

My friend is one of thoſe people, who having formerly cut a very gay figure in the world, is ſtill ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of ſpreading the May-bloom of twenty-five upon the winter of threeſcore; and deſirous of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing in the fulneſs of his ſpirits, that ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and vivacity which time has relentleſsly taken from his perſon: with this view he is everlaſtingly aiming at double entendres, and will not even heſitate to crack his indelicate ambiguities upon his children. On the contrary, he often attacks his daughters with a vein of the moſt culpable levity, and tells them, when the poor young ladies are ready to ſink with ſhame and mortification, that they know very well what he means, and that he is perfectly ſenſible they are both languiſhing for huſbands.</p>

elſe, I always endeavour to keep him in a little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and this renders my viſits uncommonly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to his family. Laſt night I managed him pretty well, and we had not above ten or a dozen indelicacies during ſupper time: but the cloth was no ſooner removed, than he cried, <q>come, Mr. Babler, I'll give you a toaſt;</q> this was what the ladies extremely apprehended, and they all inſtantly roſe up from table, with an abruptneſs that would have aſtoniſhed a ſtranger prodigiouſly, and darted out of the room: upon this he burſt into a loud laugh, and ſlapping me on the ſhoulder with an air of extraordinary ſatisfaction, exclaimed, <q>Well, my boy, you ſee I am ſtill old Truepenny, and though to the full as heavily laden with years as yourſelf, have fifty times your ſpirits, and can ſet the women a going whenever I think proper.</q> Then turning round to the clergyman, and pointing to his ſon, he aſked, with an arch ſignificance of countenance, <q>Do you think, doctor, that fellow will be a quarter the man I am when he comes to my age — hey — what ſay you petticoats.</q> The gentleman replied, he believed not; and my friend ordered us to fill a bumper directly, for he ſtill piques himſelf upon being able to drink a couple of bottles of an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>WHEN our glaſſes were charged, <q>Now, (ſays he) I'll give you a toaſt:</q> he did ſo with a witneſs; and totally forgetting the preſence of his ſon, the profeſſion of the clergyman, and the ſobriety of my
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0136400201:284"/>
character, gave what would ſcarcely have iſſued from the underbred intoxication of an Iriſh chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a night cellar. For my own part, I turned round in diſguſt, the clergyman wiped his face, and the ſon ſtooped to buckle his ſhoe, in order to avoid the diſagreeable neceſſity of bluſhing for his father, whoſe behaviour was no leſs ill-timed than it was illiberal. I was in hopes the viſible diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which we all manifeſted on this occaſion, would have kept my antiquated buck in a little order for the remainder of the evening: but here, Sir, I was miſerably miſtaken; every glaſs brought on a new inſtance of obſcenity, and produced a freſh queſtion, whether he was not the heartieſt cock, of his years, in the univerſe. The loweſt amours of his youthful days were raked up with the moſt paltry degree of oſtentation; and he ſeemed to gain a new ſhare of life from the mere repetition of thoſe circumſtances, which ſhould have made him ſorry that he ever lived at all.</p>
               <p>YOUTH is but a poor excuſe for a man's playing the fool; but no palliation can poſſibly be offered, where a grey head is ſtriving to re-exiſt in the remembrance of former vices, and is ambitious of preſerving the ſame reputation for extravagancies in the deepening vale of years, which rendered him contemptible to the thinking part of the world when a boy of nineteen. If a man is really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of being reſpected in the decline of life, he muſt act in ſuch a manner as to <hi>deſerve</hi> the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal eſteem of his acquaintance; inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0136400201:285"/>
into ribaldry, he muſt make an abſolute diſplay of his good ſenſe, and build his applauſe upon the rectitude of his own ſentiments, inſtead of applying to the depravity of ours. A debauchee of ſixty is no leſs a ſcandal to nature, than a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to morality; and we cannot help feeling a ſecret kind of horror, when we ſee a father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligately jeſting with his children, and taking every opportunity to ſteel them againſt the nicer ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of delicacy and virtue. The parent who acts in this manner has not only his own errors to anſwer for, but in a great meaſure the crimes of his poſterity. The human mind has a natural promptitude to err, and we are all of us but too fond of copying the examples of thoſe whom we have been taught to reverence and love. For the ſake of the riſing generation, therefore, let me earneſtly exhort the <hi>old hearty cocks</hi> of the preſent age, to pay ſome little regard to this reflexion; ſince the reputation and welfare of their families ought to engage a conſiderable ſhare of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, however indifferent they may be about their own.</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING a number of writers have very judiciouſly employed their pens in expoſing the ridiculous partiality which the generality of parents feel in favour of their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0136400201:286"/>
own children; yet there is one ſpecies of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality which, though the moſt fatal in it's effects, has however engaged but the ſmalleſt part of their notice; for which reaſon I propoſe to make it the ſubject of my preſent diſcuſſion, and flatter myſelf that it will be received on account of it's import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with a particular ſhare of indulgence by the public.</p>
               <p>THE prejudice upon which I intend to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, is the opinion abſurdly entertained by every body, that the beauty of their daughters will be always certain of making their fortunes. This unhappy prepoſſeſſion is now ſo univerſally adopted that few parents attend to more than the mere ſuperficials of a young lady's education; a mother now-a-days, inſtead of inculcating leſſons of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and morality, is only ſolicitous about the perſonal accompliſhments of her riſing angel: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of teaching her to be humble, modeſt, and unaffected, ſhe lays down no rules but thoſe of pride; no precepts but thoſe of arrogance, and no documents but thoſe of affectation. Before Miſs is out of her hanging ſleeves, ſhe is accuſtomed to the moſt extravagant praiſes of her own beauty, and is inſtructed in a belief, that ſo the delicacy of her complexion is attended to, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity whatſoever to pay the leaſt regard to the cultivation of her mind. Hence ſhe can argue upon the excellence of Naples dew, before ſhe knows a ſingle commandment in the decalogue; and deſcant upon the ſmartneſs of a ribband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0136400201:287"/>
ſhe is acquainted with a letter in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet.</p>
               <p>THE natural conſequence of ſuch an education is, that ſhe becomes intollerably vain, and in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portably ignorant. The firſt of theſe amiable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, her vanity, renders her totally blind to every merit in the character of another perſon; and the latter, renders her as totally inſenſible of the groſſeſt abſurdity in her own. Calculated merely for ſhew, her only ſtudy is to attract a croud of fools to the ſtandard of her beauty; and taught that a woman with ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite a face, has a juſt pretenſion to the firſt offers in the kingdom, ſhe is continually aſpiring above the level of her circumſtances. By this means ſhe moſt commonly withers in contempt upon the ſtalk of an antiquated virginity, or ſacrifices her reputation to ſome debauchee of faſhion, whom ſhe vainly imagines to draw in for a huſband. It is below a beauty ever to think of marrying with a man of her own rank: her charms are to procure ſomething infinitely ſuperior; and there is ſcarcely a tradeſman's daughter with a paſſable face, in the weekly bills, but what now and then thinks of an equipage with a tollerable degree of confidence; and imagines herſelf pretty certain at leaſt of a gentleman or a knight, though ſhe ſhould even fail of gaining a helpmate with a coronet.</p>
               <p>THE ſtrangeſt thing, however, in this unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable notion with which people are deluded, of a daughter's making a fortune with her face,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0136400201:288"/>
is, that every one ſuppoſes the world will look through the magnifying glaſs of parental prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and conceive juſt ſuch an opinion of the girl's perſonal attractions, as they are ſilly enough to entertain themſelves, without ever recollecting that others have no natural intereſt in the young lady, either to be blind to her defects, or ſenſible of her perfections; they are aſtoniſhed that we ſhould differ from their idea of her merit; and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely demand that tribute of admiration from our juſtice, which is nothing but the ridiculous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their own partiality.</p>
               <p>How often, I appeal to my readers, have they heard a mother extolling the face of ſome half-begotten thing to the ſkies, as a miracle of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and, in the fulneſs of her heart, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>my beauty, my queen, and my angel,</hi> where the poor little wretch had actually the features of a jacknapes. For my own part, I have ſeen ſuch things a thouſand times, and among my own rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too. My couſin Suke has a little girl of about ten years old, who is blind of an eye, and ſeamed with the ſmall pox, like a Savoy-cabbage; yet Suke imagines that her daughter will, one time or other, make a conqueſt of a nobleman; and has been known to praiſe the ineffable ſweetneſs of her Patty's face, though the company were at that very moment talking about lady Sarah Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, or the ducheſs of Hamilton.</p>
               <p>WERE parents, however, to act with prudence, they might eaſily judge from what they themſelves
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0136400201:289"/>
think of other peoples' children, how other people are affected at the ſight of theirs. This ſingle mode of judging would, in a moment, unbind the charm which faſcinates the heart of ſo many fathers and mothers, and convince them that there were a number of requiſites neceſſary to form a complete woman, beſides the poſſeſſion of a ſmooth face, and an agreeable perſon: they would then ſee, that a well-cultivated mind had an infinite ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over the moſt roſy cheek in the univerſe; and diſcover that ſomething more than a bare knowledge in fixing a head-dreſs, or pinning a handkerchief, was indiſpenſibly proper for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of a family.</p>
               <p>IN fact, the men are not ſuch fools as they may be generally imagined. A young fellow, if he wants to make an occaſional connexion with a lady, ſcarcely ever looks for more than figure or make. By the ſame rule that he buys a horſe, he chooſes his miſtreſs: but the caſe is widely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when he comes to think of a wiſe. However he may laugh at prudence and diſcretion in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he always requires it in her; and thinks he is infinitely more liable to ſuffer in the public opinion, through the minuteſt foible of her's, than through the greateſt error of his own: for this reaſon, the wildeſt libertine, when he thinks of marrying, generally looks out for a woman of virtue and underſtanding. Experience has taught him how ſmall a ſhare the mere attractions of a fine face have in the formation of real happineſs;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0136400201:290"/>
and if he even chooſes a perſon that <hi>wants</hi> a fortune, yet his choice is moſt commonly a perſon that can <hi>ſave</hi> one. Hence matrimony is the only thing in which he ſeldom ſuffers himſelf to be duped, and he hardly ever dreams of aſking the hand of a mere beauty, while there is a poſſibility for him to gain a woman of real beauty and merit too.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE ſtrictures in your laſt paper, on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous propenſity which the generality of people have to ſuppoſe the beauty of their daughters will at any time be ſufficient to make their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, are ſo very much in point, that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a deſire of troubling you with my little ſtory, eſpecially as it may perhaps be a means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other parents from following the unhappy example of my poor father and mother, whoſe ill-judged tenderneſs in this reſpect was the original ſource of all my misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>MY father you muſt know, Mr. Babler, was the youngeſt ſon of a good family, but had, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no other dependance than an employment under the government, which brought him in about five hundred pounds a year. As he was naturally of a generous diſpoſition, he never thought of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0136400201:291"/>
mending his circumſtances by marrying a woman with money, though he had a perſon and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs which rendered it no way difficult for him to ſucceed with the ladies. On the contrary, Sir, he followed the implicit direction of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; and before he was five and twenty, married my mother, the daughter of a Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire baronet, whoſe whole fortune conſiſted of a long line of anceſtors, a high notion of gentility, and a very agreeable face.</p>
                  <p>WITH a diſpoſition on both ſides to make every thing wear the moſt elegant appearance, it is not to be wondered at, if on either, there were no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary notions of oeconomy. I was born in about a twelvemonth after their union; and I have heard my mother ſay, the bare preparations for her lying in, amounted to near a hundred and fifty pounds. Being the only product of their affections, I was treated as if I was ſomething more than mortal. In my earlieſt infancy I was diſcovered to have ſome irreſiſtible attractions. My mother, before my eyes were well open, declared them a pair of the tight killing kind; and if I happened but to cry for a little bread and milk, my father found out in every ſquall ſome indications of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſagacity. In ſhort, I was looked upon as an abſolute <hi>Olio or ſalmongundy of perfections,</hi> to uſe the words of a faſhionable author, and was almoſt in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being devoured, through the <hi>inſatiable</hi> fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as I may call it, of my poor father and mother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0136400201:292"/>WHEN I grew towards ſeven or eight, and had paſſed the ordeal of a fiery ſmall-pox with pretty good ſucceſs, I was pronounced a perfect beauty; and my friends all concluded, that it was impoſſible but what ſuch a woman as I promiſed to turn out, muſt make her fortune by her perſonal attractions. Infatuated by this unaccountable prepoſſeſſion, my mother's ſole attention was confined to thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments which were rather engaging than neceſſary, and rendered a woman ſuperficially agreeable, without being of any intrinſic uſe. Thus, Sir, when other girls of my age were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing pretty faſt in the progreſs of French, Italian, and Engliſh authors, I was ſtudying how to play at quadrille, or exerciſing the whole army of my little graces before the looking glaſs. Inſtead of growing a miſtreſs at my needle, and aſſiſting to make up the linnen of the family, I was inſtructed to laugh at induſtry, and told, that poring on a piece of work would inevitably injure my eyes, or endanger my conſtitution. Going to church they as good as told me, was extremely vulgar, and it was hinted that I ſhould ſhew my ſpirit by taking care to rate the ſervants very ſoundly, whenever they grew either familiar or impertinent. In ſhort, Sir, in this hopeful manner I reached my ſixteenth year, and knew nothing in nature but how to make a cap, play a game at cards, turn out my toes a little tollerably, and play a leſſon or two on the harpſichord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0136400201:293"/>AS I was now bordering on the age when my mother expected my perſon would work miracles, ſhe took uncommon pains to tell me, that thoſe who were my equals only were infinitely beneath me; and that none but thoſe who were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably my ſuperiors, could poſſibly be as good as myſelf — Vanity and indiſcretion, the characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtics of my years, were open to every document of this nature; and I looked upon it as a deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from my conſequence, to be ſeen in leſs than honourable company. For this purpoſe I even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to be treated with indifference; put up with an inſult from the daughter of a man of faſhion, for the ſake of numbering her amongſt my acquaintance; and permitted ſome familiarities, not criminal however, from her brother, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the honour of his attending on me in public. — The conſequence of this behaviour was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fatal: — Before I was eighteen, I refuſed two or three very conſiderable offers from people of my own rank; and before I was nineteen, fell a victim to the illiberal machinations of a villain with an earldom, who viſited on my account at my father's, and flattered him with a notion of ſpedily becoming my huſband.</p>
                  <p>NOT to dwell upon this unhappy circumſtance, ſuffice it, that ſhame and diſappointment quickly broke the heart of my poor father, who died, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting with his laſt breath his error in my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and was followed by his miſerable relict in leſs than ſix weeks. With my father died all my
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0136400201:294"/>
hopes of ſubſiſtence, and what I ſhould have done for bread God only knows, had not a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lady, who was compelled into a marriage with my betrayer, a little after I was undone by him, purchaſed me out of her pin-money an annuity of a hundred pounds for my life, and generouſly ſent it me in a manner that doubled the obligation. Upon this I have reſided near ten years in a remote part of the country, endeavouring, by a cloſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the beſt authors, to unlearn the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of what I was formerly taught; and to attone by an exemplary conduct, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my days, for the indiſcretions of my paſt behaviour. May my ſtory prove a means of preventing the ruin of other young women; and teach ſuch parents as mine, that the only way of raiſing a real happineſs for their children, is to lay the foundation on diſcretion and virtue.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THERE is a ſpecies of ill-breeding which I have obſerved to be extremely prevalent among ſeveral of our modern pretenders to polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and which as it gives much uneaſineſs to a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0136400201:295"/>
number of well-meaning people, I have taken the liberty of condemning in the following little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; and ſhall, therefore, eſteem it as a ſingular obligation, if you will lay it before the public, through the channel of your excellent paper.</p>
                  <p>YOU muſt know, Mr. Babler, that I live in a tollerably genteel ſtreet, not far from Lincoln's-inn, and have made it my principal ſtudy during the whole time of my reſidence, to give no offence whatſoever to any perſon in the neighbourhood. Unhappily however, Sir, there is an antiquated gentleman, who lives almoſt oppoſite to me, and who has a family conſiſting of a wife every whit as venerable as himſelf, two daughters to whom nature has been uncommonly parſimonious in the diſtribution of her perſonal graces, and a ſervant maid. As this amiable little community pique themſelves prodigiouſly on the regularity of their own conduct, they are continually upon the watch to pry into the behaviour of every body elſe. Hence, Sir, if a gentleman knocks at my door about buſineſs, ſome one of them continually runs to the window to ſee who it is, and comments in a tone lould enough to be diſtinctly heard acroſs the way, either upon his dreſs or his perſon. If I have company with me in the parlour, ſome of them ſtand centinel on me at the dining-room; and if I take my gueſts into the dining-room, they mount to the ſecond floor, where they have a full command of all my motions, and reduce me to the diſagreeable alternative of bearing the whole
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0136400201:296"/>
torrent of their impertinent obſervations, or of letting down my curtains. — To be ſure, Sir, I am not the only object of this obliging ſolicitude; as far as they can poſſibly ſee, they manifeſt a laudable anxiety for the conduct of their neighbours; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortunately ſituated in a houſe pretty remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the convenience of it's proſpect, they ſtrike a kind of awe through a number of families con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably better than themſelves, and are almoſt as good as our reforming claſs of conſtables, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the minuteſt propriety of behaviour.</p>
                  <p>DID their impertinence, however, extend no farther, it might perhaps be borne with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of temper, and they might poſſibly be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as objects of our pity, without ever exciting our reſentment. But alas! Mr. Babler, the buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a ſhoe, or the wearing of a clean ſhirt, ſets them into a tittering; and a little more powder in one's wig than ordinary, occaſions a horſe laugh. My wife, Sir, being as good-natured and placid a girl as ever exiſted, this diſpoſition gives them ſo great an advantage over her, that ſhe can never look out of her own window, and is always in the greateſt diſtreſs if the ſervant keeps her a moment at the door. If ſhe puts on but a freſh gown to viſit a friend, ſhe hears, <hi>"Lord we are dreſt to day,"</hi> breaking from the oppoſite ſide of the ſtreet; and if ſhe ſends home but an humble leg of mutton from market, there is a, <q>Pon my word we are reſolved to live well however, let who will pay for it."</q> — Nay, Sir, my little girl, an infant under two years of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0136400201:297"/>
age, come in for her ſhare of this delicate treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and her mother having a day or two ago bought her a new bonnet, the child has ever ſince undergone the ſevereſt exertion of their wit, and <hi>"God love you look at miſs"</hi> is the continual expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whenever the maid appears with her at the door, or takes her out into Lincoln's-inn gardens for a little air and exerciſe. In ſhort, Sir, not an article in our dreſs, nor a feature in our faces, eſcapes the eagle-eyed notice of our worthy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and there is ſcarce a poſſibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how very unhappy we have been rendered by this exceſs of curioſity and impertinence.</p>
                  <p>WERE theſe good people themſelves, either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for any uncommon elegance of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or amiableneſs of perſon, this behaviour would be the leſs extraordinary; — but, Sir, ſunday is perhaps the only day in the week on which they change their linnen; and I have already hinted, that there is no extraordinary ſhare of beauty in the family. As for the father, he is an abſolute <hi>Oran Otan</hi>; a meer man of the woods; the old gentlewoman is the immediate idea of that vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lady to whom <hi>Saul</hi> paid a midnight viſit at <hi>Endor</hi>; and the eldeſt daughter to an unmeaning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of face that actually borders upon lunacy, joins a couple of tuſhes that project a ſurpriſing way from the mouth, like the forks of an elephant; the youngeſt, to borrow an expreſſion from the <hi>Copper Captain,</hi> has a <hi>huſk about her like a cheſnut,</hi> which ſo compleatly abſorbs every veſtige of humanity, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0136400201:298"/>
I am almoſt at a loſs in what order of beings to rank her; and therefore, though her ſex has perhaps been already aſcertained, I ſhall put her ſpecies down in the doubtful gender.</p>
                  <p>THERE is nothing, Mr. Babler, which betrays an underſtanding ſo weak, or a heart ſo malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as an inclination to render others unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly uneaſy. The people of every little neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, like the members of the largeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, ſhould always endeavour to engage one another's eſteem by a mutual intercourſe of good, at leaſt of obliging, offices: true politeneſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this unfaſhionable ſenſe of the word may be exploded, conſiſts in exerting our utmoſt abilities to promote the ſatisfaction of our neighbours. A contrary diſpoſition, though it may be reckoned extremely witty by ſome, can be conſidered in that light by none but the ignorant or the worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Whoever thinks the approbation of ſuch an eſſential to their happineſs, has my full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſollicit it; but I will readily affirm that every ſenſible and benevolent mind will hold them in deteſtation or contempt, and look upon them as an equal diſgrace and nuiſance to ſociety. What a pity is it, Sir, that like other nuiſances there is no method of preſenting them by a grand jury: as there is not, ſuffer me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them in this manner, and be aſſured, you will have the thanks of many families in my part of the town, beſides thoſe of your moſt humble ſervants,</p>

               <p>TO know mankind, and to profit by their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, is generally the wiſh of the mercenary; but there are ſome who think, that, expoſing their own follies to the public view, is the trueſt means of acquiring an inſight into thoſe of others. This method of a man's ſubjecting himſelf to voluntary diſtreſs, in order to become acquainted with human nature, goes by the name of ſeeing life; ſo that, as the phraſe goes, the young fellow is now ſaid to have ſeen moſt of life who has experienced moſt miſery.</p>
               <p>I HAVE often with pity regarded ſome of my more youthful acquaintance who took this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental way of becoming philoſophers, and who thought proper to buy all the little wit they had by their ſufferings: and yet, in fact, when we come to examine this aſcetic ſect of ſtudents, we ſhall find them utterly ignorant of real life, and ſkilled only in the ceremonies of a night cellar, or the etiquette of a brothel.</p>
               <p>IT is amuſing enough to liſten to one of theſe gentlemen, who has the character of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly verſed in life, exerting his ſuperiority of ſkill in company. He has a new phraſe for every thing; <hi>"tip us a wag of your manus,"</hi> is, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſhake hands; <hi>"let us have a buſs at your muns,"</hi> is let me kiſs you: for ſuch humour as this, our
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0136400201:300"/>
unfortunate creature has had his head broken, his pockets picked, and his conſtitution deſtroyed, though fully convinced of his errors the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was running into them with the greateſt avidity.</p>
               <p>IT has been often ſaid, that half the pains which ſome men take to be rouges could very comfortably have ſupported them in honeſty. With equal truth it may be ſaid, that half the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours which theſe men uſe in the purſuit of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, could have ſupplied them with a double portion of the means. Pleaſure is not ſo coy a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs as theſe men would perſuade us that ſhe is; ſhe needs not be purſued through the mazes of a night adventure, nor earned by the hazard of looſing a noſe; the uſual beaten tract to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ever the ſureſt, and to live like the reſt of mankind is a ſtrong preſumption that the traveller is in the right way. When one of our blooded young fellows, with a true eccentricity of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeparates from the crowd, in order to enjoy higher delights than his acquaintance, he only becomes the object of contempt and deriſion, and like a deer in the foreſt he ever finds leaſt ſafety when alone.</p>
               <p>THE ridicule of every age has been levelled againſt this abſurd purſuer of life, and ſtill like the witch in the fable, as he has been hunted down in one ſhape he has aſſumed another. In the Spectator's days, the buck of the time was called a <hi>Mohock</hi>; he afterwards received the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0136400201:301"/>
of a <hi>Blood</hi>; and, at preſent, he is called a <hi>Buck:</hi> the three characters of the different times, however are very nearly the ſame; they differ in little more than appellation; and are all equally diſtinguiſhed for malevolent of heart and weakneſs of underſtanding.</p>
               <p>THE moſt extraordinary circumſtance in the characters of theſe worthy gentlemen who know ſo much of life, is, that ſcarcely one in a thouſand of them knows any thing of life at all; or at beſt, like a maggot in a cheeſe, he only eats into the rotten part of it, and, after fattening for a ſeaſon on the common of folly and licentiouſneſs, he comes out pampered with nothing but ignorance and immorality.</p>
               <p>LET one of the moſt experienced philoſophers in the ſyſtem of modern life, come, for half an hour, into company with two or three rational beings, and he looks as if he was abſolutely of a different ſpecies. — Converſant with nothing but what he ought <hi>not</hi> to know, he is incapable of conducting himſelf, either like a man of ſenſe or a gentleman, and, acquainted only with the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable frolicks of the Garden, he is at a viſible loſs if a ſubject of the leaſt erudition is ſtarted, and perplexed if he hears a ſyllable bordering upon politeneſs or good breeding; he languiſhes only for an indelicate toaſt, or an opportunity of introducing ſome paltry little adventure, which ought to be reſerved for a ſet of intoxicated ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0136400201:302"/>
on a Chriſtmas holiday. Even in the preſence of the moſt modeſt among the ſofter ſex, he does not heſitate to mention the name of ſome faſhionate demirep; nor ſcruple to boaſt of a Newgate acquaintance with an executed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman.</p>
               <p>YET, notwithſtanding this deſcription of a <hi>modern buck</hi> is pretty exact, there is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable ambition among the greateſt number of our young fellows to ſhew a tolerable preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the character. From a ſtrange opinion that libertiniſm is a proof of good ſenſe, they all ſacrifice the little ſenſe which they poſſeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come libertines, and are infinitely leſs fearful of being looked upon as profligates, than being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed as fools.</p>
               <p>THOSE however, who would willingly arrive at the good opinion of the world, and merit the ſecret approbation of their own hearts, muſt act upon a very oppoſite principle. Little as the world may follow the documents of virtue, it nevertheleſs admires them; and we ourſelves are never more ready to venerate a man of principle, than when on account of our vices he treats us with contempt. Let us therefore, inſtead of being what in our hearts we really deteſt, endeavour to arrive at what we are ambitious to be thought; and make that very pride which hurries us into ſuch a number of exceſſes, a laudable incentive to the road of perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0136400201:303"/>VIRTUE in fact wants only to be known to have a number of admirers; and as in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of thoſe vices which deſtroy both our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and our eternal felicity, habit encreaſes our reliſh for perſevering; ſo in the practice of all that can enſure our happineſs here and hereafter, habit alſo impels us to proceed, and furniſhes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual inducements, which gradually lead us to the moſt exalted pinnacle of human excellence. The man therefore, who will not be happy, has no-body to cenſure but himſelf; as the power is entirely in his hands, if he chooſes but to exert it.</p>
