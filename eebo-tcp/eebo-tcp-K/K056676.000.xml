            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Year 1660. If any think that Time is not ſufficiently remote, they ſhall

            </p>
            <p>About the Year 1660, the general Book of Rates was made in <hi>England,</hi> according
to an Act of Parliament, whereby a Subſidy of Tonnage was laid on <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and a Subſidy of Poundage after the Rate of 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> upon all Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
Imported.</p>
            <p>In Imitation of this, in the Year 1664, the <hi>French</hi> made a General <hi>Tariff</hi> or Book
of Rates, wherein they followed us in Rating all Goods and Merchandizes at a Tax
of about 5<hi>l. per Cent. ad Valorem,</hi> except that, for the Encouragement of their own
People to improve in Trade and Manufactures, all the Manufactures of <hi>Silk, Gold, Silver,
Hair, Thread,</hi> and <hi>Wool,</hi> were Rated at 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> according to their Value. This <hi>Tariff</hi>

old Duties payable by the <hi>Tariff</hi> of 1664. Except <hi>Broad-Cloth</hi> and <hi>Serges,</hi> which are
to pay, (as by the <hi>Tariff</hi> of 1699) (that alſo being capable of being moderated by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners)
thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Broad-Cloth,</hi> which from the Year 1667, paid 80 <hi>Livres,</hi> will now pay only 55 <hi>Livres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mill'd <hi>Serges,</hi> which paid 15 <hi>Livres,</hi> now 11 <hi>Livres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All other wollen Goods pay after the <hi>Tariff</hi> of 1664, (as aforeſaid,) when their
<hi>Wines</hi> paid Duty here but 7 <hi>l. 10 s. per Ton,</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi> but 1 <hi>l. 10 s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This part being thus ſtated, let us turn the Tables, and view the other ſide of the Trade,
(viz.) Our Import from <hi>France,</hi> where the Particulars will be very ſurprizing; and this
following Concluſion is moſt natural there from, (viz.) That if we Traded with <hi>France</hi>
to our Advantage before, much more muſt we do ſo now; for the State of the Trade
between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ſtands thus.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Ninth Article <hi>adds,</hi> And all Prohibitions, Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations, Decrees made

of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſhall be repealed.</p>
            <p>As to this it is objected; that it is not ſaid <hi>Goods and Merchandizes of the Subjects of</hi>
Great Britain, but <hi>Goods and Merchandizes of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>which implyes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the
Manufactures of</hi> Great Britain <hi>only.</hi> But the Abſurdity here is ſo groſs, that it is ſtrange
the Wiſdom of the <hi>Turkey Company</hi> ſhould fall into it: For (1.) if it had been meant of
the Manufactures of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> only, it would have been ſaid, <hi>The</hi> GROWTH <hi>and</hi>
PRODUCE, <hi>not the Goods and Merchandizes.</hi> By Growth and Produce, indeed the
Manufactures had been underſtood; but by the Goods and Merchandizes of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> muſt be underſtood, the Goods and Merchandizes, which the Subjects
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> TRADE IN. But (2.) it is out of Queſtion, That if the taking
off the Prohibitions, &amp;c. of the Goods and Merchandizes of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was meant
only of the Manufactures, then was the whole <hi>Levant Trade</hi> prohibited ſtill; which
the Gentlemen do not pretend to.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that the Conſtruction the Company would have put on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Words
of the 9th. <hi>Article,</hi> (viz.) Goods and Merchandizes of <hi>Britain,</hi> would be the Ruin of that
very Trade which they Petition to ſupport, and would Prohibit all their <hi>Levant</hi> Goods
in <hi>France.</hi> Such People, like Children, muſt be dealt with by the Nature of things, and
muſt have given them not always what they DO ask, but what they WOULD ask.</p>

It would be reaſonable here to deſire thoſe People who inſiſt ſo much upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
of <hi>Cloths</hi> and <hi>Serges</hi> out of the <hi>Tariff</hi> of 1664, to conſider what the exception
amounts to, and how far it may hurt the Trade, that they may Judge whether the
Damage is equal to the Complaint: To this purpoſe the Difference in the <hi>Serges</hi> is ſet
down again here; (viz.) That the <hi>Serges</hi> which paid 10 Livres in 1664, and were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
brought to 15, and then to 24, and after that prohibited, may now be freely Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into <hi>France</hi> paying only 11 Livres, that is to ſay, one Livre advance upon a
piece of 15 Ells; and the Difference upon <hi>Cloths</hi> is, that the Piece which paid 40
Livres before, in 1664, muſt pay now 55, being 15 Livres upon about 31 Yards <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Meaſure.</p>
            <p>To make this Eſtimate more plain, it is to be noted, that the <hi>Ell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

theſe Caſes is to be underſtood the <hi>French Ell</hi> containing 5 Quarters of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Yard,
and ſo the Account of the Exception of <hi>Cloths,</hi> and <hi>Cloth Serges,</hi> may be read thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cloths per piece</hi> containing 25 <hi>Ells,</hi> that is, 31 <hi>Engliſh Yards</hi> and a <hi>Quarter,</hi> to pay 15

            <p>Conſidering Men, when they come to weigh this, will be apt to wonder what it is
the Trading part of this Nation have been ſo much allarm'd at in the Treaty with
<hi>France,</hi> and will hardly be brought to believe that the Complaints which have been
made of ruining our <hi>Manufactures</hi> and encouraging the <hi>French,</hi> ſhould all be raiſed from

from <hi>France,</hi> with alike ſmall Advance on the <hi>French</hi> Goods more than they paid in
1664. Whereas every body is ſenſible that the <hi>French</hi> are to pay here upon all their
Goods 2, 3, 4 or 500<hi>l. per Cent</hi> higher Duties than they paid in 1664, and in ſome Goods
much more. Had theſe advanced Duties been taken off, how would they alledge that
Foreigners were encouraged; that the Bread was taken out of the Mouths of our own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
that the Importing <hi>Manufactures</hi> from abroad, which we could make at Home, was
taking away the Employment from our own Poor to give to the <hi>French:</hi> Yet this is
the Caſe here. The <hi>French</hi> have given all the Encouragment they could to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to fall upon the making the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> it is ſuppoſed
none can blame them for that; ſome ſteps they have taken in it which promiſed them

in</hi> 1664.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid of the Liberty of Commerce obtained by the Treaty with <hi>France,</hi>
the Reduction of the Duties in <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Tariff</hi> of 1664, and the Reſerve or Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of two Species of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> only, (viz) of <hi>Broad Cloths</hi> and <hi>Serges,</hi> to a ſmall
Advance of Duty; has been more than ſufficient to explain thoſe things to any Mens
Underſtandings, which are not politically dull: Unleſs theſe People expected that her
Majeſty ſhould have made a Condition with the <hi>French</hi> King, that his Subjects ſhould
make no <hi>Woollen Cloth,</hi> or that when they had made it, they ſhould not export it to
<hi>Turkey,</hi> for fear of prejudicing our <hi>Levant</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in <hi>Turkey</hi> hold their <hi>Cloths</hi> up to equal Price with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
no Buyer will take them, except when a ſufficient Quantity of <hi>Engliſh Cloth</hi> cannot be
had to ſupply the Market.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French Cloths</hi> being inferiour to the <hi>English</hi> in Quality, are for that Reaſon, and
no other, Sold in <hi>Turkey</hi> at a lower Price.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the <hi>French</hi> want the Materials, (viz) the <hi>Wool,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe
parts of <hi>France</hi> where their <hi>Cloths</hi> for the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade are made; and whither the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh Wool</hi> which they get by Stealth, cannot be carried without very great
Expence; and that the <hi>Wool</hi> they make uſe of inſtead thereof, and to mix with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Wool,</hi> is of an inferiour Quality to the <hi>Engliſh Wool,</hi> they themſelves will not deny.
But if theſe were not ſo, and they were to make <hi>Cloth</hi> wholly of <hi>Spaniſh Wool,</hi> or of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Wool</hi> mixt, yet the general Way of Workmanſhip of the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is known to be ſlighter and looſer in all their <hi>Manufactures,</hi> than the <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>
of the like kind made here, and that our Workmen perform almoſt all kinds of
Work-firmer and more ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>antial, not only than the <hi>French,</hi> but alſo than any other
People. So that our <hi>Cloths,</hi> and even all our <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> will Sell for a better
Price, than <hi>Manufactures</hi> of the ſame Denomination from other Countries.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Silk Manufactures,</hi> they have ſuch a ſufficient Proviſion, made for them,
and ſuch Encouragement given them already by the high Duties on Foreign wrought
<hi>Silks,</hi> as well of <hi>France</hi> as of any other Country, that as they ſtood in no need of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
during the War, ſo they ſtand in need of no farther Aſſiſtance during the
Peace.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon, as they have nothing to ask but that thoſe Duties ſhould remain;
ſo the <hi>Treaty of Commerce</hi> has taken none of them away; and if the <hi>Silk Manufacture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
cannot ſubſiſt with that Difference upon them which thoſe Duties have laid, neither
would they ſubſiſt with a Total Prohibition.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that during the ſaid high Duties, particularly upon <hi>Alamodes,</hi> and
<hi>Lustrings,</hi> none of them have been Imported here, that is, legally Imported; as for
Clandeſtine Importation, or Running of Goods, that can be no Argument, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0026300700:8"/>
can the Quantity be great, or is it poſſible entirely to prevent thoſe things either
in this Country or in any other. The Difference between the Manufactures of <hi>Silk</hi>
at home, and thoſe imported, ſtands thus:</p>
            <p>Foreign wrought <hi>Silks</hi> of all kinds, pay for every 20 pound Weight, <hi>L. 12. 3. 7. Netts Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alamodes</hi> and <hi>Luſtrings,</hi> pay for every 20 pound Weight, <hi>L. 31. 17. 3. Nett Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Foreign wrought <hi>Silks</hi> pay above 12 <hi>Shillings per Pound</hi> Weight, Duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Importation, all Diſcounts taken off; the Diſadvantage which they muſt lie under,
muſt exceedingly leſſen that Importation, and ſeems ſufficient not only to encourage,
but to quicken the Induſtry of our own <hi>Weavers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince the Encouragement of the <hi>Silk</hi> Trade, and Employment of the <hi>Weavers</hi>
is ſpoken of as a thing of ſuch extraordinary Weight, it may be very neceſſary to ſtate
the Caſe of <hi>Manufacturing</hi> in general, that our Opinion of things may be rightly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd.</p>
            <p>It
is an undoubted Rule of Trade, that the Employment of our own Poor, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of our own Growth, is the firſt Principal of <hi>Commerce,</hi> and ſhould be the laſt
End of all our National Improvement.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Great Britain</hi> is ſtated in Matters of Trade, this Concern for the General Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of that Trade, centers upon our <hi>Woollen Manufacture:</hi> There is a juſt Concern
due to every Branch of Trade, but to that moſt, which moſt contributes to, and is
moſt eſſential, in the two great Ends of Trade above-mentioned; (viz) <hi>Employment of
the People, and Conſumption of the Produce.</hi> This the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> is ſo far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
in, to all other Branches of our <hi>Commerce,</hi> as admits of no Compariſon; and
therefore the principal Concern of the Nation is, and ought to be the <hi>Woollen Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, Prudence may ſo guide, as that this Concern for the <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi>
tho' it be with a Preference to all our other Goods, yet may not be in Oppoſition to
them; there being a manifeſt Difference between, ſhewing a peculiar Regard to one, and
injuring the other; as a Man having many Children, may ſhew a peculiar Affection
to his eldeſt, without injuring the reſt: But then, on the other hand, neither muſt
any of the other Branches of Trade claim or expect ſuch a Regard or Concern to be
ſhewn to them, as ſhould be injurious to the <hi>Woollen Manufactures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Silk</hi> Trade is uſeful and advantageous, but <hi>Silk</hi> is a modern <hi>Manufacture,</hi> and
is uſeful and advantageous, as it is a Return for, and encourages the Exportation of
the <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> and no otherwiſe: The <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> is the Eldeſt
Child of the Nation's <hi>Commerce:</hi> The <hi>Silk</hi> Trade is a Foſter-Child taken into the
Family, made uſeful and meriting to be encouraged, but always with a Subſerviency
to the Good of the Heir.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants drive any conſiderable Trade to <hi>France</hi> with raw <hi>Silk,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from <hi>England</hi> by Re-Exportations, or from the <hi>Levant</hi> directly; the <hi>Silk</hi> they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it is allowed, muſt be the Product of <hi>Engliſh Manufactures;</hi> ſo that by that Method,
not only our own <hi>Silks,</hi> but, even the <hi>French Silks</hi> alſo, as to the Materials they are
made of, are the Product and Return of the <hi>Engliſh Woollen Manufactures.</hi> The next
Difference is the Workmanſhip, which lies thus, that one is perform'd by the <hi>French,</hi>
whom we ought to have no Regard to in Trade; the other is perform'd by our own
People, whom we ought to ſupport.</p>
            <p>But granting this; if on the other hand, a Bale of wrought <hi>Silks</hi> ſhould be brought
from <hi>France,</hi> bought there with a Bale or Bales of <hi>Spaniſh Cloth,</hi> or other <hi>Woollen
Goods,</hi> it is eaſy to prove that it is more our Intereſt to bring over that Bale of wrought
<hi>Silk;</hi> and that the ſaid wrought <hi>Silks</hi> are more our own <hi>Manufacture,</hi> than if they
had been wrought in <hi>Spittle-Fields;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> which were firſt
ſent to <hi>Turky</hi> to purchaſe the raw <hi>Silk,</hi> which this Bale of <hi>Silks</hi> was wrought from,
and the <hi>Spaniſh Cloths</hi> or other <hi>Woollen Goods</hi> ſent to <hi>France</hi> to purchaſe the ſaid <hi>Silks,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0026300700:9"/>
when wrought, not only conſumed the Growth of <hi>England,</hi> but employed above Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
times the Number of People in their making, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more than the Bale of wrought
<hi>Silks</hi> would have done, if they had been made in <hi>Spittle-Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, this implies no Danger at all to the <hi>Engliſh Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Silk,</hi>
becauſe tho' the Humours and Fancies of ſome expenſive People may run them upon buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Foreign wrought <hi>Silks,</hi> yet while the high Duties here remain as they are to do by
the <hi>Treaty,</hi> the Difference of Price will be always ſuch as will leſſen the Demand of
Foreign <hi>Silks,</hi> reſtrain the Humour aforeſaid to a few People, and preſerve the Bulk
of the <hi>Manufacture</hi> in our hands.</p>
            <p>It is objected by ſome, That the Difference is not ſufficient; that notwithſtanding
12 <hi>l. 3 s. 7 d.</hi> to be paid upon the Importation for every 20 Pound Weight of wrought
<hi>Silks,</hi> yet that the <hi>French</hi> will bring in their <hi>Silks.</hi> But this amounts to no more than
this (viz) That they will bring in ſome few: Which is what as above, may be to
our Advantage. But they will not pretend, that the Difference of the ſaid Duty ſhall
not leſſen that Importation, and reduce it to a ſmall Quantity, and that the Groſs of
the Trade ſhall remain in our own hands.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of the Petitions of the <hi>Silk Weavers,</hi> and of others who pretend to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in their Behalf, is in ſhort this, That the Importation of <hi>French</hi> wrought <hi>Silks</hi>
may be prevented: The Pretence to make their Petitioning national, is the Danger,
they ſay appears, that <hi>French</hi> wrought <hi>Silks</hi> will now, by Virtue of <hi>the Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi>
be imported in great Quantities into <hi>Britain,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> being able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-work
us, will alſo Under-ſell us, and the Weavers thereby be ruin'd.</p>
            <p>What Foundation there is to ſupport theſe Things, will appear, upon making a few

               </gap>ies upon wrought <hi>Silks</hi> Imported, is given in Anſwer to
the <hi>Weavers,</hi> and ſeems to make their Apprehenſions appear very irrational: Above
31<hi>s. per Pound</hi> Duty on the Importation muſt be paid upon <hi>Alamodes</hi> and <hi>Luſtrings,</hi> and
above 12<hi>s. per Pound</hi> upon all other wrought <hi>Silks;</hi> except <hi>Italian Silks</hi> Imported in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Ships, which pay Duty 10 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Force of Reaſon prevailed in the firſt, and the <hi>Weavers</hi> have given it up,
owning at the Bar of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> that the Difference is ſufficient in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamodes</hi>
and <hi>Luſtrings,</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> can do them no harm there; but it ſeems they
think 12 <hi>s.</hi> or 10 <hi>s 6 d. per pound</hi> too little upon the other wrought <hi>Silks:</hi> But they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did not know, or omitted to take notice, that the Raw <hi>Silk</hi> which thoſe <hi>French</hi>
Goods are made of, pays Sixteen <hi>Livres per pound</hi> Duty at the firſt Importation into
<hi>France;</hi> that the wrought <hi>Silks,</hi> when ſhipp'd again to be brought hither, pay 5<hi>l. per
Cent.</hi> Cuſtom <hi>ad Valorem</hi> upon their Exportation, both by the <hi>Tariff</hi> of 1664; and that
the other Charges, ſuch as Tranſportation by Land-Carriage to the Ports they are ſhipp'd
at, Commiſſion for <hi>Buying, Fraight, Riſque</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> &amp;c. cannot be ſo little as 5 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> more. So that here is about 12 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more upon the Value of the Goods to
be added to the Difference of <hi>12s.</hi> or <hi>10s. 6 d. per pound;</hi> all which put together,
makes ſuch a Weight upon the Foreign wrought <hi>Silks,</hi> and gives ſuch an Advantage
to the <hi>Engliſh Weavers,</hi> that it is wonderful to think they ſhould complain.</p>
            <p>To add to the Conviction of theſe Things, it ſhall be a little examin'd, what effect
this Difference has already had upon the <hi>Silk</hi> Trade; from whence may be Eſtimated
ſome thing of what may be expected for the time to come.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Weavers</hi> ſaid Themſelves, at the Committee of the Houſe of Commons, that they
make to the Value of Three hundred thouſand Pounds every Year, in <hi>Black Silks</hi> only;
whether it be Truth or not, is not eaſy to be examined: But in this Caſe, if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, we are not to queſtion it, for if it be an Error, it is againſt themſelves; their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0026300700:10"/>
Quantity of other <hi>Silks</hi> they ſpake of as prodigiouſly great. It cannot be amiſs to
obſerve then, what Quantity of Foreign wrought <hi>Silks</hi> have been imported here from
all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> under our high <hi>Duties,</hi> and ſee what Proportion they bear to the
Quantity which theſe People ſay they make at Home, whether theſe Foreign wrought
<hi>Silks</hi> have been <hi>French</hi> or no, is not the Caſe; The <hi>Duties</hi> are near the ſame; and as they
are Imported from Countries to which <hi>France</hi> had an open Trade, it is not improbable
many <hi>French Silks</hi> have been among them, and if more has not come in, the Difference
made by the <hi>Duties</hi> have been the apparent and only Reaſon, and the ſame Reaſon
muſt hold good ſtill, as long as the ſame <hi>Duties</hi> remain.</p>

            <p>All that can be alledged againſt this is, to beg the <hi>Queſtion</hi> and ſay, <hi>That There will
be more Imported now;</hi> but before that can be allowed, they ſhould ſhew a good Reaſon
why more was not Imported in theſe Years above-ſtated, being the Quantity from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
was always much greater, before the raiſing the <hi>Duties</hi> here; and that Reaſon
which is good for preventing the Importation from <hi>Italy,</hi> will be good for preventing it
from any other Country.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid againſt the Reaſon of this, is ſo little to the Purpoſe, and with
ſuch little Force, that it is worth no Notice, the Facts are ſo clearly made out, that
they amount even to Demonſtration: The high Duties have effectually check'd the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of wrought <hi>Silks,</hi> and will do ſo ſtill. If the <hi>French</hi> had their <hi>raw Silks</hi> chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
than we have it, how comes it to paſs, that ſo much weight has been put upon
the <hi>Levant</hi> Company's obtaining a Liberty of Exporting <hi>Raw Silk</hi> from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France?</hi>
which is obtain'd for them by the <hi>Treaty,</hi> and which the Company are now fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
is ſettled to their advantages. If the <hi>French</hi> had <hi>raw Silks</hi> cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
it would be abſur'd to ſpake of our ſending <hi>raw Silks</hi> from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France.</hi> Goods

are ſhipped from Port to Port, to mend their Market, not to leſſen their Value; if our
Merchants did not advance the Price, they would never ſend their Goods abroad.</p>
            <p>Not only the <hi>French</hi> have not their raw <hi>Silk</hi> Cheaper than <hi>England;</hi> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>England</hi> has their <hi>raw Silks</hi> cheaper than all the World; thoſe Countries excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
who have it of their own; and this will appear, by the great Quantity of <hi>raw

            <p>If any Nation in the World can have <hi>Raw Silk</hi> cheaper than <hi>England, Italy</hi> may be

            </p>
            <p>It is needful to go back and look into the former State of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade, before
the late <hi>Treaty,</hi> and enquire into the Nature and Reaſon of the Alterations, Additions
and Encreaſes, which have been Accidents to that Trade, and which have brought it
from what it was, to what it now is; in which, if the Cauſes aſſign'd for it's Encreaſe
are miſtaken, the Notions we entertain of ſuch and ſuch things endangering its Decreaſe,
will appear equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly groundleſs.</p>
            <p>Two general and Vulgar Errors, or Miſtakes, are entertained among us relating to
the firſt part of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade; (viz) what it was before the <hi>Treaty</hi> with <hi>Portugal;</hi>
and two more relating to what it now is, or will be by reaſon of the <hi>Peace.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
about what it was, are (1) That the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> had prohibited all our <hi>Woolllen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures.</hi>
(2) That the Encreaſe of our Trade or Export to <hi>Portugal,</hi> was occaſioned
by, and depended upon the Encreaſe of our Demand for Their Wines. Our Miſtakes
about what the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade is now, or is like to be, are, (1) That upon our reducing
the Duties of <hi>French Wine</hi> by the <hi>Treaty of Commerce</hi> with <hi>France</hi> to an Equality with the
<hi>Portugueſe Wines,</hi> the <hi>Wine</hi> Trade from <hi>Portugal</hi> will be ruined, and we ſhall import no more.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0026300700:12"/>
(2) That upon this, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> will immediately prohibit our <hi>Woollen Manufactures;</hi>
and ſo that great Trade which it is alledged, tho' falſly too, Exports two Millions Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Growth</hi> and <hi>Manufacture</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> will be loſt.</p>
            <p>If every one of theſe may be clearly proved to be Miſtakes, and that neither the
things ſuggeſted, or the Conſequences drawn from them, can be ſupported by Truth
or Reaſon, then all our Uneaſineſs about this <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade; will appear cauſeleſs and
ill grounded. To do this, there needs no more than to ſtate Matters of Fact; and
give ſuch Proofs of every thing as the Caſe will admit.</p>
            <p>1. That all our <hi>Woolen Manufactures</hi> were Prohibited before the War, is a Miſtake;
and truly this is a Miſtake of ſuch a Nature, ſo obvious, and ſo eaſy to be confuted,
that it is wonderful it ſhould be expected by any body to do their Arguments any
Service. It is well known upon the Exchange, and no <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchants of any
long ſtanding, can be ignorant that the Prohibition was ONLY of our <hi>Medley Cloths,</hi>
which were forbidden not only to be imported there, but to be worn; the Reaſons
whereof alſo were aſſigned, (viz.) Not that they ſet about the making them there,
as ſome alledged, but becauſe they found their People forward to run into the <hi>French</hi>
way of Clothing and Dreſſing themſelves, which the Court for many Reaſons thought
fit to prevent. But no Man who has any competent Knowledge of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade,
will pretend that the <hi>Bays, Says, Perpets, Serges, Stuffs, Stockings, Cotions, Plains, Kerſeys,</hi>
&amp;c. which were always the Groſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Exportations to <hi>Portugal,</hi> were ever
under any Prohibition there, or any other of our <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> the <hi>Woollen
Cloths</hi> as above only excepted.</p>
            <p>That what is ſaid here may, as <hi>it is Reſolved all things in this Paper ſhall,</hi> carry it's
Evidence along with it, the Words of the late Treaty with <hi>Portugal</hi> may be produced
for Proof: In the Second Articles after the Proportion between the Cuſtoms of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
Wines and the Cuſtom of <hi>French</hi> Wines is ſettled, follow theſe Words; <hi>Butt if this
Abatements of Cuſtoms as is preſumed to be made, ſhall be after any manner prejudiced or Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
ſhall be just and lawful for his Sacred Royal Majeſty of</hi> Portugal, <hi>again to forbid the</hi>

CLOTHS.</p>
            <p>The next vulgar Error, or Miſtake, which we are led into about the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade,
is, that the Encreaſe of our Exports of the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to
<hi>Portugal,</hi> is occaſion'd by, and depends upon the Encreaſe of our Demand for their
Wines: This, however abſurd, and in its Nature contrary to the Truth of Fact, is the
thing on which the Argument is made to turn; from which they would infer, that
as our Demand for <hi>Portugal</hi> Wine decreaſed, ſo will their Demand for our <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>
decline: And in ſhort, that if by the coming in of <hi>French</hi> Wines, the <hi>Portugal</hi>
Wine ſhall be wholly left off, as they vainly ſuggeſt, ſo will alſo the Demand for our
<hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> ceaſe, and that Trade be loſt.</p>
            <p>The People who argue thus, confute themſelves in their own Calculations: For
Firſt to magnify the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade, they tell us that we export thither Annually the
Value of Two Millions <hi>Sterling,</hi> moſt of it in the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
againſt this, give them leave to make their own Eſtimates of the <hi>Wine</hi> we Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from thence, and take the largeſt Year and the higheſt Price they can reaſonably
ſuppoſe, the Quantity will not amount to above 8 or 9000 <hi>Ton,</hi> which Account there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0026300700:13"/>
will in the purſuit of this Article, appear Reaſon to make great Abatement of too; but
were it ſo, and account the Wines prime Coſt one with another, at 15 <hi>l. per Ton,</hi>
or, <hi>to pleaſe them,</hi> at 20 <hi>l. per Ton,</hi> which is much above the true Coſt in in <hi>Portugal,</hi> they
will not amount to 200,000 <hi>l.</hi> which by their own Account, is leſs than one Tenth
part of the Demand for our <hi>Manufactures.</hi> This will very ill make it out that their
Demand for our <hi>Manufactures</hi> is occaſion'd by, and depends upon our Demand for
their Wines; by which they muſt make it appear, that the Nine parts of the Trade de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Tenth, and the greater is occaſioned by the leſs, which is an Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
in the very Nature of the thing.</p>
            <p>But the matter of Fact is evident, and known to all that have any tolerable Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade, (viz) That the Encreaſe of the Trade to <hi>Portugal,</hi> has
been occaſion'd by the Diſcovery within theſe few Years of the Gold Mines of St.
<hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Brazils,</hi> by which an immenſe Treaſure is gain'd yearly to the <hi>Portugueze</hi>
Nation, as well as to their King; that by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sail of Ships from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>Brazil,</hi> are now Seventy, Eighty, to a hundred Sail, and
the Exports of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods to <hi>Portugal</hi> are increaſed in Proportion.</p>
            <p>This is the true and the only Reaſon of the Encreaſe of their Demand for <hi>Engliſh
Manufactures;</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for their <hi>Wines,</hi> than it depends upon any thing that has no Relation at all to it.</p>
            <p>It is very ſtrange to find the Oppoſers of any Argument lay the whole Streſs and
Weight of what they have to ſay upon any thing which they are not very ſure they
can ſupport the Truth of. But it is perfectly ſurprizing to ſee Men value themſelves
and their Cauſe upon Accounts and Calculations which are fraudulent and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
known by Themſelves to be ſo, and which they might be ſure, in an Age like
this, when Men take nothing upon Truſt, would by inquiring Heads be ſoon detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and expoſed.</p>
            <p>Nothing of this kind can be more wonderful, than what we ſee practiſed juſt now
by ſome People, in handing about a Paper call'd, <hi>A SCHEME of the Trade between</hi>
England <hi>and</hi> France, in order to make the Trade between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> look
with an Aſpect to pleaſe them, and to anſwer all the <hi>Romantick</hi> things they have
ſaid of it; which Paper or SCHEME, was Printed in 1674, and ſaid to be Sign'd by
ſeveral eminent Merchants of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Something might be ſaid to the Deſign of that Paper, when it was firſt publiſhed,
and to the Perſons who Sign'd it (viz.) <hi>That it was Calculated for a Deſign then on
foot, to expoſe the Publick Management, and divide the People againſt the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be proper than for the detecting the Fraud of this <hi>Scheme,</hi> to enter into an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of ſome of the Particulars wherein it differs from the true Account of that

of the true Account from the <hi>Custom Houſe,</hi> as it is now laid before the Honourable
Houſe of Commons by the Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>By both which it will appear, that the Deſign of this Paper, call'd A <hi>SCHEME,</hi>

Two <hi>Obſervations</hi> ſhall contain what is ſufficient to ſay to this part of it, and nothing
can be deſired to expoſe it more.</p>
            <p>1: That here is not half of the ſpecies of Goods named which are every Year Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>France,</hi> and which, as appears by the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Books were actually Exported
to <hi>France</hi> that Year.</p>
            <p>2. That of the ſpecies of Goods which they have named, they have not ſet down
the true quantities which were really Exported to <hi>France</hi> that very Year.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch Tokens of a deſign'd <hi>Colluſion</hi> and <hi>Prevarication,</hi> that nothing of that

            <p>But to deſcend to a few <hi>Particulars</hi> of this <hi>Fraud,</hi> that the People may ſee in how

The remaining <hi>Particulars</hi> are ſo many, as makes it plain, that the Value of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations
to <hi>France</hi> for that Year exceeded the Value of our Importations from
<hi>France</hi> very conſiderably, as by the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Books will appear.</p>
            <p>The Errors in the Account of the Importations, are no leſs unfairly Stated than
theſe, and the Fraud is extended to a much greater Value; Nay, even the manner of
Stating it, diſcovers a deſign of Impoſing upon the Publick. For Firſt the Export is
confine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the Port of <hi>London,</hi> only with an allowance of one Third more for the out
Ports, whereas the Import is ſaid to be for the whole Kingdom, let them take it which
way they Pleaſe.</p>
            <p>If their Imports are for the Ports of <hi>London</hi> only, then they have committed a
Fraud in the Quantities to the Value of above 721,796 Pounds, as will be prov'd by the
<hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Books.</p>
            <p>If their Imports take in the whole Kingdom, then they have committed two Frauds
inſtead of one (1.) In the Quantities: And (2.) In offering to ſtate the Debtor ſide of
the Account upon the Port of <hi>London,</hi> with a Gueſs at one Third more of the Out-Ports,
AGAINST all that they ſay was Imported in the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If they had deſign'd a fair and juſt Account, They ought to have ſtated the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and Imports exactly for the Port of <hi>London,</hi> and have made the Addition of one
Third for the out Ports equal to both ſides; and have ſtated both ſides upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and Exports of the whole Kingdom; For if the Exports exceed the Imports for
the Port of <hi>London</hi> only, as appears by the <hi>Custom-Houſe</hi> Books: It would have been
much more ſo for the Out-Ports, becauſe many of our Out-Ports, which lye in or near
thoſe Countries where the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> are made, <hi>Fiſh</hi> cured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Export
much greater Quantities to <hi>France,</hi> than they could conſume the Value of in <hi>French</hi>
Goods, as <hi>Exeter, Colcheſter, Yarmouth,</hi> and many other Ports.</p>
            <p>But the Prevarications are yet more groſs, and the Value greater; As one part makes the
Exportations to <hi>France</hi> ſeem leſs; ſo the other as dexterouſly makes the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from <hi>France</hi> ſeem more: Nor will their making a Gueſs or Wholſale Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of one Third for the Out-Ports on one ſide anſwer for it, unleſs they had
either made the ſame allowance ſerve on both ſides, or extended the Account to the
ſame period of Time on both ſides without it; but acting fairly did not ſeem to ſuit
the Deſign.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who would ſupport the Paper call'd <hi>A Scheme,</hi> produce a Paper, ſaid to be
Signed by the Farmers of the Cuſtoms, containing an Account of the Importations
of <hi>Wines, Brandies,</hi> and <hi>Linnen</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1667, to <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1669,
which they make to be very large, and from whence they would argue, that one half
thereof muſt be the Rule of the Year 1669. Had this been a meer Gueſs, or had it
been at any other time, the Calculation might have been leſs ſuſpected. But there lies
ſo juſt an Exception againſt the Year 1667, and it was ſo well known to them, that
it cannot be any thing but a meer Deſign.</p>
            <p>It is well known, the Plague had in the Year 1665 put an univerſal ſtop to all
Trade, except ſuch as Neceſſity forc'd the People to, for meer Proviſions. The next
Year the Fire of <hi>London</hi> happen'd; and as the Fire began near the water ſide, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Warehouſes and Cellars of the Merchants, the Quantities of <hi>Wines</hi> as well
as of other Goods which were ſpoil'd or deſtroy'd, were very great. Add to this
a War with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> by which the Trade with both was ſtop'd, and which
War was not ended till the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1667.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things might well ſuppoſe <hi>England</hi> to be ſo Exhauſted of <hi>French</hi> Goods, as that
the Importation of the next Year, (viz) 1667, muſt be prodigious great; and no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judgment can be made of the Trade to or from <hi>France</hi> by the Accounts of that
Year. This is farther demonſtrated by the Article of the <hi>Brandies</hi> which the Account
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0026300700:16"/>
of the Farmers aforeſaid makes for the ſaid Two Years to be but 3775 <hi>Ton.</hi> But by an
Account of the ſame Farmers for the laſt Five Quarters of the ſaid two Years, (viz.)
from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1668, to <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1669, the whole Quantity of Brandy Imported,
amounts to no more than 680 <hi>Ton;</hi> and yet the <hi>SCHEME</hi> affirms, there was 4000
<hi>Ton</hi> of <hi>Brandy</hi> Imported from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1668, to <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1669. And this is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
as one undeniable Evidence of the Fraud of that <hi>SCHEME.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may be a parallel Caſe found out to illuſtrate this, and that is of the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Lead</hi> from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1662, which amounts to, as by the
<hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Books, a moſt prodigious and unuſual Quantity (viz.) From <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
1662, to <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1663, there was Exported from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> 21,757 Fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Lead,</hi> which at 12 <hi>l. per Fodder,</hi> as the <hi>Scheme</hi> allows the Price to be, amounts
to 261,084 <hi>l.</hi> It would be acknowledged very unfair, that this ſhould be given in as
an Article of our uſual Export of Lead to <hi>France;</hi> for, as an extraordinary Year is no
juſt Rule to take a Medium of Calculation from, ſo no more is the Year 1667, to be
taken as a proper time to Calculate our Importation of <hi>Wine</hi> from <hi>France;</hi> the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Accidents of a Plague, the Fire, and the War, joining together to make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for Wines that Year extraordinary great.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is a Fate upon us, that the Inconveniencies and Ill-Conſequences of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
a Trade ſo evidently Beneficial to <hi>England,</hi> muſt be diſcovered by our Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and muſt be felt before they will be known; in which Caſe this Paper will
have Occaſion not only to mention thoſe Inconveniencies before hand, but to remind
you of them when they happen.</p>
            <p>This Paper ſhall alſo, in its Courſe, be adapted to the ſeveral Trading Counties and
Towns of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to make appear, that now the War is ended, all the Goods
and Commodities of <hi>France</hi> may be Imported into this Kingdom, eſpecially ſuch as are
to be Re-exported, as <hi>Brandies, Linens, Silks, Paper, Laces,</hi> &amp;c. Since upon ſuch Re-exportation
all the additional Duties are drawn back; when at the ſame time not
one Yard of the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which are all prohibited in
<hi>France,</hi> nor of our <hi>Fiſh</hi> and other material Commodities, can be Imported into <hi>France,</hi>
the Articles not being made effectual.</p>
            <p>The Inſtances of this, ſhall be hereafter eſpecially applyed to the particular Trading
places of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who will thereby be able to judge whether this is not the
true State of their Caſe, and whether the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Flemings</hi> will now have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> as they have had for above 20 Years laſt
paſt, and reſerve to themſelves the <hi>Dreſſing, Dying</hi> and <hi>Finiſhing</hi> of thoſe Goods;
whereby the <hi>Manufacturers</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> will become Slaves to Foreigners, who
will either ſet their own Price upon our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> or ſet up Fabricks of their
own in Imitation of them, all which might have been avoided, by having an open
and direct Trade with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Paper ſhall not ſuggeſt ſo much Unhappineſs to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whoſe general
Good it is deſign'd to promote, as to propoſe that the Articles of <hi>Commerce</hi> ſhall not
in time to come be farther conſider'd. The Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> who are the true
Judges of their Countries Good, cannot be ſuppoſed to omit any thing that ſhall be
apparently for the publick Advantage; and therefore when it ſhall appear to them
which we will not queſtion, that theſe Articles are proper to be Re-conſider'd, they
will no doubt, act therein, as Reaſon and Juſtice requires.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, ſeeing we are to carry on our Trade without the Advantages
which were expected from the <hi>Treaty,</hi> let us enquire upon what Terms we are to
carry it on, and how we ſhall Trade with <hi>France</hi> for the time coming.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tariff</hi> of 1664 is now no more to be mentioned in this Affair: The low Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which our Goods would have paid in <hi>France,</hi> are out of the Queſtion. The Edict
of 1701 muſt now be the Rule of our Trade in <hi>France:</hi> And that this may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

without any Difficulty, and be as little ſubject to Miſtakes as poſſible, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict

This is a ſtrict View of the preſent State of the <hi>Engliſh Commerce</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and
theſe are but part of the Burthens and Incumbrances of our Trade there, which her
Majeſty, by the <hi>Treaty of Commerce</hi> with <hi>France,</hi> and in her juſt Concern for the good
of her Kingdoms, had procured to have her Subjects delivered from; But the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
being not made Effectual, they are now to continue, ſo that our Trade is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in general prohibited there, till ſome Act ſhall be paſſed here, to render Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
the Proviſions made for a Freedom of <hi>Commerce,</hi> and till Two Months after, all
which time the Profits of an advantageous Trade are loſt to this Nation.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, that while all theſe high Duties and Prohibitions remain
upon our Trade into <hi>France,</hi> moſt of the <hi>French</hi> Goods are ſtill at Liberty to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
here, paying the high Duties; the Caſe of which will be, that for all of thoſe
which may be Re-exported whither to our Plantations, the <hi>Spaniſh West-Indies,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parts, thoſe high Duties will be all drawn back, and the <hi>French</hi> Goods be ſo far
prejudicial to our <hi>Manufactures</hi> without our having any Share of the Advantage from
the Trade to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, the <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Brandies</hi> which may be uſed at Sea, or in Foreign
Parts, will draw back all the high Duties; and for the other part (viz) the Home
Conſumption, they will be brought in as <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portugal Wines</hi> and <hi>Brandies</hi> or elſe
ſmuggled upon the Coaſt: The <hi>Silks, Linnen, Paper,</hi> &amp;c. will come in as <hi>Dutch</hi> and

that they prohibit Trading with</hi> France, <hi>at the begining of the firſt War,</hi> By

            <p>Theſe <hi>Arguments</hi> are ſo pungent, and carry with them ſo much Weight, that it makes

ſide; for it is hardly Rational to ſuggeſt, that the Trade between theſe Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can be to the Diſadvantage and Loſs on both ſides</p>
            <p>Many Deluſions have been ſpread about to amuſe and deceive the People in this
Matter of the <hi>Treaty of Commerce</hi> with <hi>France;</hi> ſome of which have been Detected and
duly Expoſed, and many who have been Deceived by them begin to recover their
Judgments, and to find that the <hi>Treaty</hi> which they have been prevail'd upon to Reject
and Contemn, is really a Foundation of the moſt advantageous Commerce that <hi>Britain</hi>
can be engaged in; That the <hi>French</hi> muſt Trade with us under the moſt diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
Conditions imaginable; That our Export will be eaſy to us, their Imports here
hard and Loaden with Burthens to them; and we begin to ſee theſe People now
repent the Oppoſition they have all along made to their Countries Good, and would
undo what others have done if it was in their Power to do ſo.</p>
            <p>But there are ſtill Miſtakes behind, which muſt be removed, and Objections which
however they may be ill-grounded, yet require ſome Notice of them; as eſpecially
this (viz) That there are but three Ports in <hi>France</hi> at which our <hi>Manufactures</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be Imported, (viz.) St. <hi>Vallery</hi> on the <hi>Soame, Roan,</hi> and <hi>Bourdaux.</hi> It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
to reflect how much this prevails in the Minds of the People, conſidering it is
evident that the limiting the Ports for Entry, concern only the two Species, (viz.)
the <hi>Cloths</hi> and <hi>Cloth-Serges,</hi> which is plain by the Specifications of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> and not
all the reſt of our <hi>Woollen Manufactures.</hi> But as to all our other <hi>Woollen Manufactures,
Bays, Says, Serges, Perpets, Stuffs, Druggets, Dozens, Kerſies, Stockings,</hi> &amp;c. All our Re-exported

and before this <hi>Treaty,</hi> the ſaid two ſpecies of <hi>Manufactures</hi> were confined to but Two
Ports, (viz.) <hi>Calais,</hi> and St. <hi>Vallery</hi> on the ſame.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that the Reaſon why the <hi>French</hi> Confined our ſaid <hi>Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>

upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods, the <hi>French Manufactures</hi> would not be told, that the <hi>Engliſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures</hi>
ſo excelled the <hi>French,</hi> in the real intrinſick Value, that if theſe were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
tho' upon the hardeſt Terms to be Imported into <hi>France,</hi> yet they would gain
Ground there; and to be brief, would Sell before the <hi>French,</hi> albeit the Difference

things they will not allow, having on many Occaſions publiſhed that the <hi>French Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures</hi>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0026300700:20"/>
But on the other hand, this ſuggeſtion cannot in general be True; for had it been
ſo that the limiting the Importation of the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> to a few cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Ports, was contriv'd to Load the ſaid Goods with the farther Burthens of Land-carriage,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why then ſhould the Ports they were limited to, be choſen out upon
the greateſt Navigable Rivers in <hi>France,</hi> neareſt to the Place where the Centre of their
Trade lay, and where the chief Conſumption of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> was to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For Example; <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> The City of <hi>Roven</hi> lies on the River <hi>Sein,</hi>
and is to <hi>Paris</hi> as <hi>Graveſend</hi> is to <hi>London:</hi> From thence the Navigation of the <hi>Sein</hi>
conveys every thing by Water upon Five great Rivers, (viz) by the <hi>Oyſe</hi> and the
<hi>Aiſne</hi> into the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> and the lower <hi>Champain</hi> to the City of <hi>Rhiemes,</hi> the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telois</hi>
and the Edge of the Dutchy of <hi>Bar;</hi> by the River <hi>Maza</hi> through the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Champain,</hi> by the <hi>Yonne</hi> into <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Nivernois,</hi> and by the River <hi>Loyng</hi>
and the <hi>Canal de Briare</hi> into the great River <hi>Loyre</hi> to the Cities of <hi>Orleans, Nevers, Blais
Tours, Angers,</hi> &amp;c. even down to the <hi>Occean,</hi> and through the very Heart of <hi>France:</hi>
Again the City of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> is the Centre of the <hi>Engliſh Commerce</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and where
the greateſt Number of our Ships reſort for the <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Brandies</hi> which are brought
from thence, Therefore appointing <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> as one of the Ports for the Import of
our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> was rather making the Trade eaſy than difficult to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
ſo far from a deſign of making our Goods dear, and encreaſing the Charges upon them,
that it was rather giving Eaſe to it by opening that only Port to which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could
bring them upon the eaſieſt Terms of <hi>Fraight,</hi> and where the greateſt Demand for
thoſe Goods was to be found; where the principal Conſumption of them might be
excepted, and where the greateſt Convenience of <hi>Ireland</hi> Navigation was to be had,
in order to convey the ſaid <hi>Manufactures</hi> to all Parts of the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> For
the City of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſtands on the <hi>Garonne,</hi> from whence they have a Navigation by
other Rivers; (viz.) the <hi>Dordonne</hi> quite through <hi>Perigott</hi> and <hi>Limoſin</hi> into <hi>Auvergne;</hi>
by the River <hi>Lot</hi> through <hi>Quercy</hi> and <hi>Rovergne</hi> even to the <hi>Sevennes,</hi> and by the Royal
Canal from the City of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> on the <hi>Garonne</hi> quite through the Province of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi>
to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and into the mediterranean Sea; ſupplying the whole Provinces of
<hi>Gaſcoign, Guienne,</hi> and <hi>Languedock</hi> with <hi>Britiſh Manufactures</hi> by Water Carriage.</p>
            <p>This rather ſeems to intimate to us, that the <hi>French</hi> King finding it convenient on
other Accounts to limit the Importation of theſe Goods to certain Ports, yet appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thoſe Ports ſo, as that his Subjects might have the Goods brought with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Eaſe and the leaſt Charge that could be to thoſe Markets, where the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of them was, and where the Principal Traders in thoſe Goods were ſettled;
who from thence ſupplyed the whole Kingdom by the Convenience of Water-Carriage:
As to the Reaſon of naming particular Ports and Places for the Importation of theſe
Goods, it is known to thoſe who are acquainted with the Affairs of <hi>France, That it
was occaſioned by the differing Circumſtances of the Contracts with the Farmers,</hi> and was a
thing practiſed in other Caſes in <hi>France</hi> as well as in this of the <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi>
as particularly the <hi>Drugs</hi> and <hi>Spices</hi> which are limited in almoſt the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>Alſo this limiting the Importation of Goods to certain Ports, is not a new Practice
or peculiar to <hi>France</hi> only; the like is done in <hi>England,</hi> particularly the <hi>Alamodes</hi> and
<hi>Luſtrings,</hi> are confined to the Port of <hi>London;</hi> and the Importation of <hi>Wooll</hi> from <hi>Ireland</hi>
is limited to Three or Four Ports only, but however is ſo ordered, not that the <hi>Iriſh
Wooll</hi> ſhould by Reaſon of Land-Carriage be made dearer to our <hi>Manufactures</hi> than the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> in order to diſcourage the Importation of it; But for other particular Reaſons,
drawn from the Circumſtances of the thing it ſelf; and therefore the Towns to which
the Importations of <hi>Iriſh Wooll</hi> is limited are ſuch, as are not only neareſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

            <p>Further it might be demanded why the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould not rather lay ſtill high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               </gap>ties on the ſaid <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> than ſtudy to raiſe their Price by the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of their Importation; the former being the readieſt Method of Diſcour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ging
their Market, and which would at the ſame time have brought in ſome Gain to the
Crown, which is an Article they are far from being forgetful of in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much has been ſaid in Diſcourſing on this Subject, about the Ballance of the <hi>French</hi>
Trade being againſt <hi>England:</hi> That the Ballance formerly againſt <hi>England</hi> has been Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that with good Reaſon; the contrary in many Particulars evidently appearing;
But that the Ballance will be againſt <hi>England</hi> NOW, is too evident; for it is impoſſible
to be otherwiſe: the Nature of the Trade will not permit it to be otherwiſe; The <hi>French</hi>
will bring in great Quantities of their Goods here, of which ſome will always be
conſumed at home, what Price ſoever they coſt; and all that we want for Re-Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
whether to our own Colonies or other Parts will go abroad, drawing back
the high Duties, which, as it is alledged, are to hinder our Trading in them. So that
ſtill all our Foreign <hi>Commerce,</hi> ſo far as theſe Kind of <hi>Goods</hi> are Demanded, will be <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt this, it is demanded, how muſt Payment be made? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>all our Trade to <hi>France</hi>
is in ſome Reſpect prohibited, as has been ſhewn by the Edict of 1701, publiſhed
MERCATOR (No. 13.) and what is not prohibited is loaded with ſuch high Duties,
as are almoſt equal to a Prohibition: We have been told that we pay for all the Goods
we buy in <hi>France</hi> with ready Money, whether we did or no BEFORE may be debated
another time, but it is evident that we ſhall buy NOW; the Articles not being made
Effectual, muſt be paid for with Money, or not paid for at all; for the <hi>French</hi> will take
nothing of us. So that they having formerly ſhut the Door of <hi>Commerce</hi> againſt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
we have bolted it now on the wrong ſide, and will not ſuffer them to open it
again, altho' they are willing to do it.</p>
            <p>If the Ballance of Trade by this means runs againſt <hi>Britain,</hi> which before always ran
againſt <hi>France,</hi> we cannot blame them, but muſt blame our ſelves, who have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have it ſo, and have ſo blamed our Party-Intereſt with our Trading-Intereſt,
as to ruin the one, in order to carry on the other.</p>
            <p>The Objection upon which all this Matter ſeem'd to turn, has been, that the <hi>French</hi>
have NOW all kinds of <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> of their own making, and have no
need of our Trade; this is carryed ſuch a Length by ſome, that they inſiſt, that the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0026300700:22"/>
               <hi>French</hi> make all the ſorts of our <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> as good as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and much
cheaper than they can be made here; that they are able not only to ſupply themſelves
but other Countries, nay all Countries ſays one Author; and <hi>Britain</hi> too, ſays another
Author: But it would be ask'd of theſe warm People, <hi>Why then do they ſo ſtrictly and
carefully Exclude, Prohibit, or Load with Duties, all the</hi> Engliſh Woollen Manufactures? If
their own are better and cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> their Quality would be a Prohibition
as effectual as an Edict or <hi>Arrest du Conſeil,</hi> and much more, and other Prohibitions
would be needleſs.</p>
            <p>But whatever we are pleaſed to ſay, the <hi>French</hi> know better, and as they have good
Reaſon to be moſt ſenſible of the Defects of their own <hi>Manufactures,</hi> ſo they are very
careful to keep the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods out, that the Goodneſs of one againſt the Meanneſs
of the other, may not be diſcovered by the Trade it ſelf: Nothing can be a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Proof of the Miſtake of thoſe People who talk ſo warmly of the Goodneſs and
Cheapneſs of the <hi>French Manufactures,</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> King laying ſuch repeated Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods; and after this was done, and ſeveral times encreaſed,
yet, when the <hi>Manufacturers</hi> there found, that notwithſtanding their high Duties and
Burthens, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods would be bought by their People, whatever they coſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recommended ſo effectually by their own Worth and Goodneſs, that all the <hi>French</hi>
could do in the meer way of Trade would be of no Signification to it, They Petitioned
the <hi>French</hi> King to grant a Total Prohibition of <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> which he did:
And this was all done during a Time of Peace; ſo that the War is not the Reaſon of
this Caſe, but the meer Nature of the Trade, and it is eaſy to be diſcovered that it
had been to ſmall Purpoſe to go about making <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> if the
<hi>Engliſh Woollen Manufactures</hi> were not effectually Prohibited.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty, on the other hand, has ſo effectually ſecur'd to her Subjects all the
Advantages of the <hi>French</hi> Trade, that ſhe has not only obtain'd the Revocation of all
that the King of <hi>France</hi> had been doing for 50 Years, for the Encouragement of his
Subjects in the <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> by which ſhe gives her own People a full Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to extend their Trade into all parts of <hi>France</hi> with Advantage, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
has continued upon the <hi>French</hi> Importations hither, all thoſe Inequalities and
extraordinary Duties which were needful to exclude them from any prejudicial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
in <hi>England</hi> to the Diſadvantage of her own People: By both which the Ballance
of that Trade is effectually ſecured to be on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide, and we are in a fair way
to recover all the Injury done to our <hi>Commerce</hi> by the laſt impungent Prohibitions.</p>
            <p>Would theſe People turn the Tables and make this Caſe their own, what may we
ſuppoſe they would ſay if the Queen of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had, in Her Majeſty's <hi>Treaty of
Commerce,</hi> Conſented to take off the high Duties laid on the Importation of thoſe <hi>French
Manufactures,</hi> which our People have been Encouraged by thoſe high Duties to make
here, and given Permiſſion by this <hi>New Treaty</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> to Import the ſaid Goods
upon the low Duties, which the ſame Goods paid here before the Year, 1664. <hi>For
Example,</hi> Should the Duties on <hi>French Alamodes</hi> and <hi>Luſtrings</hi> have been reduced to
6 <hi>s. per l.</hi> which they paid before the War, inſtead of 31 s. 10 d. which they are to
pay now; ſhould the Duties on <hi>French Brandy,</hi> which by this <hi>Treaty</hi> is to remain at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
51 l. <hi>per</hi> Ton, have been reduced to 30 s. as it was before the <hi>Revolution;</hi> May we
not ſuppoſe the Diſtiller of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Mollaſſes,</hi> the Weavers of <hi>Alamodes</hi> and <hi>Luſtrings,</hi>
and the Dealers under them all, would have made <hi>Repreſentations</hi> and <hi>Complaints</hi> of their
Trade being ruin'd and given up to the <hi>French,</hi> their Families Impoveriſh'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like
as we find the <hi>French</hi> Merchants and <hi>Manufactures</hi> in <hi>France</hi> have done on their ſide to
their King, and for which we muſt acknowledge they have very good Reaſon.</p>

            <p>They muſt be no <hi>Manufacturers</hi> themſelves, nor much concern'd for thoſe who are,
or for the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> in general, who can read this Table with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0026300700:24"/>
being ſenſible of the Diſadvantage our Trade lyes under in the preſent ſituation
of our Commerce with <hi>France:</hi> When they ſhall Read the Word <hi>Prohibited</hi> continually
before every <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> and ſhall remember, that for Twelve
Years paſt, none of all thoſe Goods have been admitted into <hi>France</hi> but by way of
<hi>Holland;</hi> whereas very great Quantities of <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> were Yearly Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thither before, beſides other Goods of the Growth and Production of our own
Country, or of our Plantations, which is the ſame thing, and ought ſo to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When
the QUEEN,</hi> who always had the Good of Her Subjects, and the Proſperity of
their Commerce at Her Heart, <hi>found it was in Her Power to open ſuch a Door of Trade
to Her People,</hi> on Terms ſo much to the Loſs and Diſadvantage of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Advantage of Her own Kingdoms; <hi>it could not but be with great Satisfaction,
that Her Majeſty gave in Charge to Her Miniſters and Plenipotentiaties,</hi> to Conclude
a Treaty, which took off all the Burthens and Prohibitions, which the Miſtakes of former
Years had brought upon the Trade, and by which Her Enemies were obliged to make deep
Wounds in their own Trade, to comply with thoſe Demands.</p>
            <p>But, it muſt be very diſobliging to the QUEEN, as well as very ſurprizing to her
Faithful Subjects, to ſee in what manner <hi>ſome People</hi> receive, and how diſingeniouſly
they Conſtrue <hi>all Her Majeſty's Endeavours to ſhew Her affectionate Concern for the Welfare
of Her Subjects, and the Proſperity of Their Commerce;</hi> as if that very Care, which Her
Majeſty has ſo Eminently expreſs'd, <hi>for Their Good,</hi> was a Contrivance of Her and
their Enemies, to betray us to the <hi>French,</hi> and to give up the <hi>Britiſh Intereſt in Trade,</hi> to
the moſt dangerous Rivals they have in the World.</p>
            <p>Certainly Mankind cannot be ſo far carried away with the ſtream of their Paſſions,
as to deny this general Maxim; <hi>That nothing ought to be believed in ſuch publick Debates
as theſe, but what is proved.</hi> This <hi>Paper</hi> has from its beginning, taken this for a Rule,
<hi>and therefore brings Authentick Proofs with it, of every Thing it ſays, yet theſe Men ſay it is
all Lies;</hi> on the contrary, <hi>they bring no</hi> Proof <hi>at all of what they ſay, and yet they expect
to be believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſhorten the <hi>Diſpute,</hi> the <hi>MERCATOR</hi> ſhall as modeſtly as the <hi>Caſe</hi> will allow
make a fair Challenge to all <hi>Oppoſers;</hi> which if they do not Anſwer, they can but ill
Juſtify any of their future <hi>Objections</hi> againſt the Truth of what is alledg'd in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>The
<hi>Challenge</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That whereas they charge this Paper with Lying,</hi> they ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to Particulars; and ſtating it truly, <hi>let the World know what ONE THING it
is the MERCATOR has Affirm'd, Aſſerted, made Publick as Truth, which is not ſo:</hi>
If this cannot be done, <hi>the charge of Lying will turn back upon them, with great Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Condition only muſt be deſir'd of them, (viz.) <hi>That they will not expect any thing
ſhould be taken upon Trust on one ſide more than on the other;</hi> and therefore that they will
be careful, as the MERCATOR has always done, to quote their Authorities for all they
ſhall ſay; the Validity of which, when Confronted with thoſe of this Paper, may be
eaſily examined, and the <hi>Readers</hi> may judge whether are in the Right; if they do not
think fit to do this, as the MERCATOR will not think it worth while to take any
Notice of them, ſo neither can they expect it of any one elſe.</p>
            <p>That their <hi>Scheme</hi> of which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oaſted, is it ſelf one general Complication of
Fraud; and falſe Repreſentations has been made appear, even to both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
The MERCATOR in that, as in every other Caſe of like Nature, ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from himſelf, but ſpakes the Language of the <hi>Cuſtom Houſe</hi> Books, gives exact
Copies of the Commiſſioners Reports, ſign'd under their Hands, and proves every thing
in particular by Authentick Papers; if theſe are falſe, the MERCATOR would be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0026300700:25"/>
very willing to ſee the Proof of it; if any miſtake has happened, whether wilful or
by the negligence of Clerks, the Books are remaining, and may be referr'd to: Why
do not theſe People tell us where theſe Miſtakes lye? why do they not prove that the
MERCATORS has made falſe Draughts of thoſe Accounts and Reports? omitted any
thing or added any thing to make his Arguments appear the Better; as on the other
Hand has been proved to be their practice, even in a moſt ſcandalous manner, in their
late SCHEME, under the hands of the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> and by them
Laid before both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>All the uſe this Paper ſhall make of this unfair Uſage, is only to proceed with
the ſame Caution in all that it ſhall make publick, ſtill taking care to offer nothing
but what is ſufficiently confirm'd by ſuch Authorities, as ſhall always ſtand the Teſt
of the ſtricteſt Examination; taking no notice of any thing which ſhall be ſaid in
Oppoſition to it, unleſs it comes likewiſe ſupported by ſuch Proofs as may give a due
Weight, and make it reaſonable to be Inquired into.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to return to the Subject of Trade, from which as few Digreſſions as poſſible, ſhall be
made in this</hi> Paper.</p>
            <p>The laſt MERCATOR gave a true Proſpect of the State of one Branch of our Trade in
<hi>France</hi> as it now ſtands, and as it might now have ſtood, had the <hi>Treaty</hi> taken place, that
is to ſay, <hi>the Branch of Trade which concerns our</hi> Woollen Manufactures <hi>in particular.</hi>
The <hi>Manufacturers</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> may there ſee what Circumſtances they are now in
as to <hi>Trade,</hi> and what their unnatural Joy is built upon which they have ſo publickly
ſhewn at the Delay of the Advantages which they might by this time have rafted of
in their Trade.</p>
            <p>Next to the ſaid Exportation of our <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> the <hi>Fiſhing Trade</hi> is our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Concern, and that more eſpecially ſince our <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Scotland:</hi> The <hi>Northern</hi>
Parts of <hi>Britain</hi> have a peculiar Intereſt in the <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> and the ſecuring a Market in
<hi>France</hi> for the great Quantities of <hi>Fiſh</hi> that are or may be Cured in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in the
<hi>North,</hi> and <hi>West</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> is of ſo great Conſequence to this Nation, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be omitted in a <hi>Treaty of Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> had not forgotten this part, or to encourage their own Subjects to launch
into the <hi>Fiſhery</hi> as well as into the other Branches of our <hi>Trade:</hi> The high Duties in
<hi>France</hi> laid upon <hi>Fiſh</hi> from <hi>Great Britain, were an effectual Support to the</hi> French <hi>Projects
of</hi> Fiſhing, <hi>and a Bar to the</hi> Fiſhing of Great Britain: For <hi>Scotland</hi> by the <hi>Union</hi> being
brought into the ſame Prohibitions, and being eſteemed as the ſame Nation, came
thereby alſo under <hi>the ſame Inconveniencies of Trade,</hi> and <hi>lost the Advantage of their Trade
to</hi> France, which before was very conſiderable, eſpecially in <hi>Fiſh; Scotland</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
before the <hi>Union,</hi> Exported to <hi>France</hi> yearly, a very great Quantity of <hi>Herring, Salmon</hi> and white <hi>Fiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot but be grateful to all thoſe Parts of <hi>Britain</hi> which are ſenſible of the <hi>Benefit</hi>
of the <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> and who depend <hi>upon the Exportation of the</hi> Fiſh <hi>when taken,</hi> to underſtand
<hi>That the Importation of our</hi> Fiſh <hi>into</hi> France <hi>is now, by this</hi> Treaty, <hi>left open upon very eaſy
Terms,</hi> and particularly, <hi>upon the ſame Terms with the</hi> Dutch; which could never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
before.</p>
            <p>The juſt Care and Concern which Her Majeſty has ſhewn for the Intereſt of Her
own Subjects, and the Extent of their Commerce, has been ſeen in removing that
Inequality, and providing that our Fiſhery ſhall now be upon the ſame Foot with
that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and have the ſame Encouragement of an open Trade to <hi>France;</hi> a
thing which however the <hi>Dutch</hi> have Taught us to reject here, they always took care
to ſecure for themſelves, and found no little advantage in it.</p>
            <p>The Merchants and Gentlemen of the <hi>North</hi>-part of <hi>Britain,</hi> and of the <hi>Weſt</hi> alſo,
have frequently expreſs'd to the Government their great Concern for the obtaining
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0026300700:26"/>
this Liberty of Commerce; and the great Advantages which it would be to them, if
obtain'd; as may be ſeen by the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of the Royal Buroughs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſent up to the Lords Commiſſioners of Trade; and of others alſo: And unleſs
we could ſuppoſe them to Act in Contradiction to themſelves, it muſt be a particular
Satisfaction to them all, to ſee what proviſion Her Majeſty has made for the ſaid <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing-Trade</hi>
by this <hi>Treaty;</hi> and it muſt be impoſſible, without an Infatuation, which it
would be rude to ſuggeſt, that the Merchants and Trading People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the
<hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of the Coaſts about <hi>Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mouth</hi> and <hi>Loeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ff,</hi> or the Counties of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi>
and <hi>Devon,</hi> can be drawn into ſay, <hi>they are pleas'd that the Articles of this Treaty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Ineffectual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus often mention'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Fiſhing-Trade,</hi> it is proper alſo to take
notice how, by the preſent Treaty, Her Majeſty made it Her eſpecial Care, in behalf
of Her <hi>Scots</hi> Subjects as well as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to have all thoſe new Burthens which were
laid upon the <hi>Britiſh Fiſhing Trade</hi> only, and which gave that Trade away from us to
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> taken away in <hi>France;</hi> and as it is very ſurprizing, that the Power of any
Party-Influence, ſhould make us in <hi>England</hi> inſenſible of ſuch advantages. So the next
Paper ſhall let you ſee what thoſe Advantages are, and that they are not equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as they are here.</p>
