            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Author of the <hi>Dunciad</hi> has now oblig'd himſelf, and is
perfectly happy in beholding his illuſtrious Brat, the juſt Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of his ſweet temper'd Parent, make his Appearance:
He had long promis'd, or rather threaten'd the Publick with this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but Nobody would believe, that any Creature could be hardy,
or vain, or wicked enough, to undertake to utter a virulent Lampoon,
with the Names of many worthy Perſons at full Length; but it ſeems,
the Raneour of his Mind has got the better of his Fears, and the Itch
of Scribling is much ſuperior to the Dread of Chaſtiſement.</p>
                  <p>Well then, having (like <hi>Caeſar</hi>) written his own Commentaries, and
given himſelf various Readings upon himſelf, having guarded himſelf
on all Sides, and ſurrounded his Text with <hi>Prolegomena, Teſtimonia,</hi>
                     <hi>Arguments, Indexes, Appendix, &amp;c.</hi> and adorn'd himſelf with all the
Pomp and Trappings that uſually attend the Dignity of an eſtabliſh'd
Writer of Antiquity: Behold him ſtrutting into the World, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to receive the Reverence due to his Quality, <hi>Optat Ephippia Mus,</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0163601700:7"/>
and however awkardly they become him, he rejoices in them. Behold
him now proclaiming himſelf a Claſſick; behold a Perſonage whom he
ſtiles <hi>William Cleland,</hi> walking gravely before our Poetical Dictator, bare
Headed, with the Faſces on his Shoulder; and a little behind him, an
ugly Northern Thing, formerly his Colleague in Scandal and Criticiſm,
an odd Mixture of <hi>Doctor, Poet, Buffoon, Punſter, Politician, Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and <hi>Cook</hi>; methinks I ſee them now marching in ſolemn Parade,
round the new created Claſſick's Garden at <hi>Twickenham</hi>; I hear them
repeating the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> and the neighbouring Shores reſound his Verſes.</p>
                  <p>Yet has not the Author of the <hi>Dunciad</hi>'s Vanity outrun his Judgment
ſo many Lengths, to perſuade him to ſet his own Name to this modeſt
Performance; therefore has he borrow'd, and very properly, the Name
of <hi>Martinus Scriblerus</hi>; and not content with this, or apprehenſive this
was not a ſufficient Protection for him, he has publiſh'd a Letter to his
Publiſher, and ſign'd it <hi>William Cleland.</hi>

                  <p>I have many Reaſons which induce me to believe, that this Friend
of <hi>Scriblerus</hi>'s, whom he calls <hi>William Cleland,</hi> is a counterfeit Friend
only, and the Words ſtand like <hi>Richard Roe,</hi> and <hi>John Doe,</hi> for Form
Sake only, in a Recovery, and to give the Modeſt Author of the <hi>Dunciad</hi>
an Opportunity of ſaying ſomething pretty in his own Favour. Mr.
<hi>Congreve,</hi> in his <hi>Way of the World,</hi> ſhews us a Coxcomb, who uſed to
enquire for himſelf at a Chocolate-houſe, and not finding himſelf there,
would leave Letters for himſelf: But our little merry Author goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he prints Letters to himſelf, writes Libels, threatens, forgives,
puniſhes, and is really the <hi>Drawcanſir</hi> of the Age.</p>
                  <p>In the Publiſher's Preface, (for <hi>our Claſſick</hi> gives us a Publiſher's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
as well as a Preface to the Publiſher) he takes upon him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for Poſterity, and very modeſtly aſſures us, that this inſipid Poem
will be read by Poſterity: Theſe are his Words, <hi>In this Monument they muſt
expect to ſurvive</hi> (<hi>And here ſurvive they ſhall,</hi> (Oh dreadful!) <hi>as long as
the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tongue ſhall remain ſuch as it was in the Reigns of Queen</hi> Anne
<hi>and King</hi> George.) If this Pigmy Animal's Wit could come up to his
Malice, what Work would he make with thoſe who ſhould be ſo unhappy
to fall under his Diſpleaſure! But as it is, if this Monument, as he calls
it, ſhould laſt; let the preſent Age inform him, and hereby it does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him, that it will ſtand only as a Monument of his Infamy; and
thoſe that come after us will and muſt believe, the Perſons who ſtood
the Marks of his petulant Malice, to be Worthy and Good Men; and
the Enemies of the Author of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> will be always look'd
upon as the Friends of Virtue; they will ſee a little invidious narrow
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0163601700:8"/>
Mind in every Line he has written; they will bluſh at his indecent
Idaeas, and be ſhock'd at his Scurrility. Therefore I applaud your Deſign,
Sir, of printing your Letter in Quarto, exactly on the ſame Size with
that of the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi>; let it be bound up with it; let them
cling together through every Age; there the Author of the <hi>Dunciad
ſhall ſurvive, and ſurvive he ſhall — As long as the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tongue
ſhall remain ſuch as it was in the Reigns of Queen</hi> Anne, <hi>and King</hi> George.
If this ſhould be the Caſe, What Courage, what Allies, what Stature
muſt future Ages conceive this Giant Warriour to be aided with? They
will imagine him at leaſt to be Seven Foot high, beyond the Growth
of his Cotemporaries, both in Stature and Underſtanding. Will they
not be ſurprized, when I aſſure them, and I do hereby aſſure them, (for
I, Sir, put in my Claim to Immortality too, by being annexed to you)
that this ſame Gyant, was but about four Foot and an Half high, of a
Structure a little irregular, and his Genius Low and indecent as his
Form.</p>
                  <p>But I loſe my Purpoſe, which was to ſhew the Improbability that any
Man ſhould be ſo weak or unadvis'd, or hungry after any Sort of Fame
to ſo mean a Degree, to place, or ſuffer his Name to be placed before a
leud and infamous Libel; therefore I ſay, This ſame Author has written
a Letter to himſelf in the Name of one <hi>William Cleland,</hi> and made him
to commend and applaud the Author, for what every one knows he
is liable by the Laws of the Land to be puniſh'd when he ſhall
be diſcovered; and for this Cauſe, at the ſame Time that he has plac'd
every Gentleman's Name whom he has abuſed at full Length, he has not
dared to ſubſcribe his own.</p>
                  <p>It is uſual for the Merry Andrew after he has play'd over his arch
Tricks for ſome Time, to put on a grave Face, to rectify his Muſcles,
and to harangue his Audience in a more ſober Wiſe, to prepare them to
receive the Doctor with Reſpect; and this is always done in a prefatory
Way, before the Doctor produces his Medals, or his Pacquets, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to poiſon himſelf or the Company. Our Doctor of the <hi>Dunciad</hi>
has thought it proper, it ſeems, that ſomebody ſhould for Form ſake take
upon him this Character; and if he has not made his ſuppoſed Friend
to riſe to the Dignity of his <hi>Zany,</hi> he may at leaſt be allowed to
be the Vinegar of the Ring, and be qualified to whip the People into
a Circle before the Sports begin. As the Character of this <hi>W. C.</hi>
thus drawn by the Libeller, is of a very uncommon Kind, I will
give it you in ſome Obſervations upon this merry Letter of the
Author of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> in the Name of this <hi>W. C.</hi> to the Publiſher
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0163601700:9"/>
of the <hi>Dunciad</hi>; that is, to Nobody, it having been never publickly
ſold when he wrote his Letter: So that here is one <hi>W. C.</hi> whom
Nobody ever heard of, writing to a certain Publiſher, whom No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
knew.</p>
                  <p>This ſame Author ſays, in the Name of <hi>W. C.</hi> that it was a
Mark of his Humanity to ſtay ſo long before he executed his Vengeance
upon thoſe who had offended him: Now, as Nobody knows better
than he, the Strength and Bitterneſs of his own Gall, Nobody can
aſſure us ſo well as he, how long Malice will keep alive, fifteen or
twenty Years at leaſt it ſeems; but now as this Humanity of his
(as he is pleas'd to call it) would be a very dangerous Plea at the
<hi>Old Baily</hi> in an Indictment for the deſtroying a Man's Perſon, I
think it ſhould weigh as little with the Candid, in juſtifying the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of a Man's Reputation.</p>
                  <p>But he makes his <hi>William Cleland</hi> a Party to his Crime likewiſe,
and declares he aſſiſted in compoſing the Libel: He makes him
affirm, he was obliged to it in Humanity, for, ſays he, very gravely,
<hi>It was an Orphan</hi>; an <hi>Orphan</hi> Libel. Libels are all Orphans, dear
<hi>William Cleland,</hi> a Sort of Children whom their Fathers never care
to own, and though your Humanity may be very great, I think
in this Caſe your Prudence will hardly weight againſt it; there are
very good Reaſons why this ſame Author does not own his Child;
and if you knew or conſider'd them, ſure you would not thruſt
your Ears into the Diſpute; but I forget that this <hi>W. C.</hi> is only
an <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> a Man of Straw, ſet up by the candid Author of
the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> to combat for him.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after this, our Libeller forgot what he juſt before af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
and makes this very <hi>W. C.</hi> to ſay, He has found out the
Father of the Baſtard; he makes him moſt impudently to declare
Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> to be the Author: If he means, as I hope he does not,
the Poet of that Name, who has been ſo much oblig'd by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
who is, or ought to be by his Education, a Gentleman, whom
Books ought to have taught Humanity, and polite Converſation and
Letters, Decency and good Manners; what does this infamous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
deſerve for making his <hi>W. C.</hi> abuſe him in this Manner. But
the Reaſons he gives why he conceives Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> to be the Author, are
equally ſcurrilous and ridiculous. <hi>Every one was curious</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to read
what could be ſaid to prove Mr.</hi> Pope <hi>a Dunce, and was ready to pay
ſomething for ſuch a Diſcovery.</hi> How came he to imagine every one
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> curious to find this Gentleman a Dunce; if he knows him to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0163601700:10"/>
the Author of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> every Man of common Senſe may eaſily
judge what he is; but as the Perſon who has written that low and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Satyr, has not yet dared to ſet his own Name before it, I
think it did not become this ſame <hi>W. C.</hi> whoever he is, to do it for
him. If <hi>W. C.</hi> was a real and not a feign'd Perſon, I do not doubt
but Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> would do himſelf Juſtice for this Abuſe, and recur to the
Laws for Satisfaction upon him.</p>
                  <p>But this Author of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> whoever he is muſt be a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Fellow, for he goes on, and makes his Man of Straw, <hi>W. C.</hi>
declare, that when he ſaw Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> attack'd or written againſt, or
anſwer'd by thoſe who were abuſed (for he will have him to be his
Author ſtill) that he thought it was become a common Cauſe; <hi>the
Danger was common to all, and his Concern ought to be ſo too</hi>; and
he cauſes him very ſeriouſly to deliver it as his Opinion, That thoſe
who <hi>attack'd Mr.</hi> Pope, <hi>muſt be Traitors to Church and State, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
(ſtrange Stuff) a little venemous Wretch, not Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> is laſh'd
for his Ribaldry and his ill Nature; and this Author makes one
<hi>W. C.</hi> without any other Proof but his bare Word, to declare,
<hi>That they have inſulted the Fallen, the Friendleſs, the Exil'd, and the
Dead.</hi> It is plain, he would in this Place put his <hi>W. C.</hi> upon us for
one not well affected to our preſent Eſtabliſhment. It is very well
there is no ſuch Perſon as this <hi>W. C.</hi> If there ſhould be ſuch a
one, and he ſhould have a Place under the Government, what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement
would not this low Author merit, for putting theſe Words
into his Mouth. We do very well know ſome People have <hi>fallen</hi>
in the unhappy Diviſions of our Country (as he gently terms the late
unnatural Rebellion) ſome <hi>are Friendleſs, ſome Exil'd,</hi> and <hi>others Dead,</hi>
and therefore, thoſe who have written againſt theſe People, muſt bear
the Laſh of our Author's Satyr; if it be true that they have inſulted
theſe People, let our Author remember, that they firſt inſulted their
Country and its Laws.</p>
                  <p>This ſame Friend of his goes on, and does now diſcover ſome Fears
that hang about him, leaſt he ſhould be taken for a Fool or a Knave, by
keeping Mr. <hi>P<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

this Letter has determined his Character; yet he very judiciouſly

or to be deemed either the One or the Other; ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

This can only be the over-weening Conceit of a Self-ſufficient Writer;
an aſſuming ſpurious Claſſick, aſſerting his Supremacy, and demanding
Obedience, as you will ſee; for immediately after this, he affects the
Regal Stile; he cauſes his <hi>W. C.</hi> to proclaim his Royalty, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he iſſues his Edicts, That all Offenders againſt <hi>him ſhall be
chaſtiſed</hi>: He likens <hi>them</hi> to <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi>; he ſays, <hi>Poverty ſhall not be any
Excuſe,</hi> nor <hi>to be pleaded before</hi> him, no more than <hi>at the Old Baily,</hi>
neither ſhall they, ſays he, receive <hi>the Benefit of the Clergy.</hi> But
ſome Time after this, his Majeſty cools, he is graciouſly pleas'd to
ſhew Mercy, and he makes his Herald <hi>W. C.</hi> to grant his <hi>Dunces
a little Bread, and a little Fame.</hi> How ridiculous is it, to ſee a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive
ſtrutting Thing, erecting himſelf into a Mock-Sovereign:
A modeſt <hi>Homuncio,</hi> who at the ſame Time that he privately aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinates,
calls thoſe whom he wounds, Aſſaſſins? But let us conſider
this Author of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> as he really is, a Perſon Poetically mad,
jealous of Fame, and envious of every Rival, graſping at the ſmalleſt
Shadow of Reputation, all his Attention fix'd to one Point, raving
after imaginary Honours, and ſeeking Infamy in Fame, and we ſhall
incline to Pity rather than Cenſure. This throws into ones Mind the
Situation of the Mad Taylor in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> who called himſelf <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great,</hi> was gracious, and bountiful, and juſt, and cruel, and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and good, and bad, as thoſe Ideas ſtruck his ſick Brain.</p>
                  <p>By this Time, Sir, you may imagine, I am not a little weary of
raking into this Heap of Nonſenſe and Vanity now before me; but as
I now caſt my Eye forward, I can't help obſerving upon this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Letter Writer, where he tells us, <hi>The Author of the</hi> Dunciad
<hi>has a Contempt for the Writings of thoſe he has written againſt</hi>:
This is not at all unlikely; One very ſeldom has a good Opinion
of thoſe whom one has an ill Opinion of; <hi>but they are Dunces,

from the Laſh of Satyr; for Great, Dignify'd, Letter'd, as they
are, ſomebody may Print and declare them Dunces, and attempt to
diſplace this Stupendous Magiſtrate and all his mad Miniſtry, who
uſurp the Throne of Wit. What a very <hi>Scanderberg</hi> of an Author is
this!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>W. C.</hi> I mean the Author of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> in his Name, goes on
and compares <hi>Boileau</hi> to himſelf: What has the Great <hi>Boileau</hi> done,
to deſerve to be compared with an inſignificant Ribald? But as he is
now concluding his elegant Epiſtle, he makes <hi>W. C.</hi> as is uſual in the

Beginning of a new Reign, to publiſh an Act of Grace, and Mercy

gently</hi> (<hi>on their Repentance and better Mind</hi>) <hi>as</hi> Perault <hi>and</hi> Quinault
<hi>were at laſt by</hi> Boileau.</p>
                  <p>This little bouncing mock Emperor concludes in the Name of <hi>W. C.</hi>
with this ſingular Obſervation on Mr. <hi>P<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi>'s Modeſty, <hi>that he never
wrote a Line, that he was ever aſham'd or unwilling to own.</hi> Now, I
think it is impoſſible any Perſon but Mr. <hi>P.</hi> himſelf can be aſſur'd of
this, at leaſt, nobody but Mr. <hi>P.</hi> can know that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> has no manner of
Grace, or Modeſty, or Morals; and he muſt be a very Blunderer of a
Letter-Writer, who could venture to aſſure the Publick ſo, and in the
Name of one, who pretends to be ambitious of being call'd his Friend.</p>
                  <p>If now, Sir, after all the Reaſons I have given to the contrary, this
<hi>W. C.</hi> ſhould happen to be an Exiſtence ſeparate from <hi>Scriblerus</hi> it appears
however, very plainly, from his Manner of Thinking, that he is very
like him, and therefore might eaſily be miſtaken for him. In this Caſe,
we can only ſay, that the Paſſion of Friendſhip has miſled him, and we
muſt forgive the Weakneſs of his Head, for the Warmth of his Heart.
This Praiſe-worthy Zeal, for maintaining a Cauſe, the Goodneſs or Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of which, the Advocate is abſolutely ignorant of, reminds me of a
Story, told me by a very merry old Fellow, who was in his Youth
enroll'd as a private Gentleman in the Life-Guards of King <hi>William</hi>:
He was in Eſteem with the reſt of the Troop, as a <hi>Soldier of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and was call'd by the Gentlemen of the Belt, by Way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
<hi>The Schollar.</hi> This Character he bore unrival'd for ſome
Time, 'till a Brother of the Sword, grew jealous of his Reputation, and
ſet up againſt him. His Rival, who had been Book-keeper to a
Carrier, (and from thence derived his Title to Letters) took every Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of oppoſing him, when any Subject, a little out of the Reach
of the reſt of the Company, was ſtarted. One Evening, my Friend,
in the Height of his Argument, threw out a Sentence of <hi>Tully,</hi> and
was immediately taken up by his Antagoniſt for <hi>falſe Latin</hi>; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
ran high, the Troop divided upon the Point, and yet were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to determine poſitively in a Cauſe, into the Merits of which,
they could not ſee; 'till one, who was the Book-keeper's Comrade,
a very brave, tho' not a learned Man, pull'd him by the Sleeve,
and leading him into a private Room, directed him to lay his Hand
upon his Heart, and inform him, <hi>upon his Honour,</hi> Whether the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0163601700:13"/>
Words ſpoken, <hi>were true or falſe Latin</hi>? And being anſwer'd, upon
his <hi>Honour</hi> they were <hi>falſe Latin</hi>; he return'd immediately into the
Circle of the Warriors they had left, and placing his Hand on his Sword,
declar'd with great Intrepidity, That the <hi>Latin</hi> the Gentleman had
ſpoken, was <hi>falſe Latin,</hi> and he would maintain it.</p>

many Thanks for the Loan of ſo uncommon a Piece,
which cannot but be highly welcome to all the true Lovers
of Scandal, ſince it leaves them no Room to doubt, as to moſt of the
Perſons libell'd in it. You were pleas'd to aſſure me, my Lord,
that it was left at your Houſe by an unknown Hand, and that
you were an utter Stranger both to the Author and to the Nature
of his Performance. It is but reaſonable therefore, that I ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy

your Lordſhip, as to theſe two Particulars, in Return for your
Goodneſs in lending me this Book, when I had ſought for it in vain,
by the Means of all the Bookſellers and Publiſhers in Town. It may
not be improper at the ſame Time to acquaint you, that Copies have
been left at many Peers Houſes, in the ſame Manner as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
was, whilſt the Favourites of the Author have had whole Cargoes
ſent them to diſpoſe of. Thus has a little inſignificant Lampooner, with
unparallell'd Impudence, made People of the firſt Quality, privy to,
and ſome of them innocently Publiſhers of his Scandal; for which,
doubtleſs he will be chaſtiſed as he deſerves.</p>
                  <p>I find at the Head of this <hi>Libel,</hi> a long ſtupid Letter, which tho' ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
by another Name, muſt doubtleſs by <hi>Scriblerus</hi>'s, or, which is
the ſame Thing, the Author of the <hi>Dunciad</hi>'s Encomium upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
He has, I know not with what Intent, brought in the Praiſes too
of one Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> maliciouſly inſinuating, that this Poem was of his
compoſing, which one would fancy it impoſſible it ſhould be; for
that Writer, after having acquir'd the Dignity of a <hi>Poet,</hi> would ſurely
never condeſcend to accept of the Office of <hi>Scavenger,</hi> and rake into
all the Filth of the Town. I confeſs, I at firſt conceiv'd the Name ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to this Letter, to be ſuch an one as <hi>Scriblerus,</hi> but I have
been ſince aſſured, that it is no fictitious Name, but the real one of
a Perſon now living, who is deeply read in the Indexes of Books
and the Secret Hiſtories of Families. Whether this be the Letter-writer's
eſtabliſh'd Character or not, the World muſt judge; but this
I will venture to affirm, that as the <hi>Real</hi> Author of the <hi>Dunciad</hi> can add
no Reputation to this <hi>William Cleland,</hi> ſo this <hi>William Cleland</hi> can add
no Reputation to the Author of the <hi>Dunciad.</hi> Should there be any
Thing here like the Aſſociation between the Lion and the Jackcall, I believe
in this Caſe, the <hi>Jackcall</hi> would prove the <hi>greater Beaſt</hi> of the Two:
Not that I would be hereby thought to exclude this Perſon from any
Title he may have to the other of theſe Appellations. I remember to
have been preſent at a Trial for a Rape, wherein, the Girl, to prove
her former Chaſtity, brought in an old Bawd for her Evidence: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
this Story will admit of no Application in the preſent Caſe; but
to uſe a Scrap of this Man's own Scrap of <hi>Latin, FASTIDITIS
GRATIAM.</hi>

                  <p>Being then oblig'd to preſume, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s known Veracity and good
Nature would not admit him to be ſuſpected of having wrote ſuch an Heap
of Lies and Abuſe as is contained in the <hi>Dunciad</hi>; I have uſed my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Endeavours to diſcover the true Author of that Poem, and having
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0163601700:16"/>
ſucceeded in my Reſearch, I have prefix'd to this Tract his <hi>Effigies,</hi> as
it has been exactly tranſcrib'd from a <hi>Buſto,</hi> which was return'd
upon a certain ingenious Sculptor's Hand, for reſembling, in a moſt
unflattering Manner, the Original. By the <hi>rueful</hi> Features of it, I am
confident your Lordſhip will immediately diſcover who is the renown'd
Father of the <hi>Dunciad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will not, I am ſure, expect that I ſhould enter into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of the Poetical Merit of that Piece; that would ſubject
me to a Taſk, for which I am wholly unfit; I mean, the reading it
a ſecond Time. But I am well inform'd, that the Reception which
the firſt Edition met with from the Town, ſhewed that the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
was thought as mean as the Deſign. In my curſory View of
it, tho' I met with ſome Lines here and there Poetical enough, yet
I thought the Generality of them very Proſaick, the whole Tale looſe
and unconnected, the Tranſitions unnatural, the Parodies on the moſt
admir'd Paſſages of the Ancients, were not only too frequent, but
likewiſe too faintly and poorly wrought up, either to ſtrike or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
the Reader; and beſides, the Naſtineſs of the <hi>Games,</hi> and of
all the Imagery in the Poem, the very Language often ſunk into
downright Ribaldry, as when a <hi>Gentlewomans Breaſts</hi> are ſtiled her
<hi>Fore-Buttocks</hi> or her <hi>Cow-like Udders.</hi> Upon the whole, I judg'd this
<hi>Dunciad</hi> to be below all Criticiſm, both as to its Stile and Verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the Morality of it, as well as of the Notes of <hi>Scriblerus</hi>
and <hi>Variorum,</hi> may deſerve a much ſtricter Scrutiny. Felons in the
Condemn'd Hold at <hi>Newgate,</hi> who have no Characters to forfeit, and
but little Enjoyment of Life to loſe, may venture to attack the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
of other Men, without Fear or Shame; but, unleſs under
thoſe Circumſtances, none but a Madman could be tempted to do it.
How ſhall I aſtoniſh your Lordſhip then, when I aſſure you, that no
deſperate Raver, but a poor Reptile; who, as he is the moſt helpleſs,
is likewiſe the moſt timid Creature living, has acted this Part. He
is become a voluntary Priſoner to his own Houſe, rather than not
enjoy the pitiful Pleaſure of aſperſing with Impunity, Perſons, all of
them better Members of the Community than himſelf, and many of
them of a much higher Rank in Life than he muſt ever pretend to;
who can only derive a <hi>Mock Title,</hi> not from his Anceſtors, but his
Shoulders. In his firſt Edition he had traduc'd certain Characters, for
which every one has always had the utmoſt Veneration, and thinks
now, by leaving out the Names of ſome, and falſly filling up the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0163601700:17"/>
Blanks of others, as well as by abſconding for a Time, to eſcape the
Stripes that ought to be the juſt Reward of ſuch Writings. How mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
therefore has it been, to inſinuate, that they have reach'd a
Preſence, where <hi>Good Nature, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> only can be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
receiv'd or encourag'd; the Reverſe whereof are the <hi>Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticks</hi>
of the <hi>Dunciad</hi>?</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible that the Retailers in Scandal have always endeavour'd
to paſs upon the World by the laudable Appellation of Satyriſts, and
would take Shelter under the great Names of <hi>Horace, Juvenal,</hi> and
<hi>Boileau.</hi> Not conſidering, that theſe Precedents will never be to their
Purpoſe; thoſe generous Correctors of Vice, never attack'd Perſons, but
Errors, nor ever expos'd the private Character, but the publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Men, at the ſame Time taking eſpecial Care to pay the
ſtricteſt Regard to Truth, even while the Scourge was in their
Hands; and therefore, <hi>Boileau,</hi> in his own Vindication, ſpeaking of
<hi>Chapelain,</hi> who was a bad Poet, ſays,
<q>
                        <l>En blamant ſes ecrits, ai je d'un Style Affreux</l>

                     </q>
I muſt likewiſe inform this half-learned Tribe, that the <hi>Codrus</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal,</hi>
which theſe abuſive Writers ſo often quote for their Juſtification,
was no real Perſon, but a Name deſign'd in general to ſignify any bad
Poet.</p>
                  <p>True and juſt Satyr will always have its Weight; Scandal will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be condemn'd: The one is beneficial to Society, the other is detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to it. Whenſoever a Man has taken upon himſelf the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of any Art or Science, by Writing, or otherwiſe, he has certainly
ſubmitted his Talents therein to the Judgment of the World. A Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therefore, who in that Art or Science, conſiſtent with good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
expoſes the Defects of his Fellow Writer, be it by Ridicule or
Argument, is guilty of nothing that is blameable, but rather does a
Praiſe-worthy Action, by endeavouring to rectify the Judgments of
Men, and prevent Pretenders to Science from impoſing on the Publick.
The cenſuring an Author then, only as ſuch, is what every Man has a
Right to do, from the Moment he appears in Print, <hi>Hanc Veniam peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſ<expan>

as a Member of Society, muſt be the Reſult of the ſame vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous
Principles, as would lead a Man to be guilty of Robbery or
Murder, had he Courage enough for the Road. The Civil Magiſtrate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0163601700:18"/>
alone has a Right to enquire into Mens Perſonal Characters, and if they
deſerve it, to expoſe and puniſh them: And it ſeems but juſt, that
this Authority ſhould be veſted ſolely in him, ſince no one elſe can,
with any Certainty, be inform'd of what paſſes in private Life.</p>
                  <p>The Predeceſſors of the Writer of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> the elaborate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of <hi>Grubſtreet,</hi> have frequently tranſgreſs'd this equitable Rule,
and finding too general a Propenſity towards enquiring into the Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes
of (otherwiſe) Great Characters, have ſometimes been pretty
liberal of their Perſonal Reflections, in order to render their ſeveral
<hi>Dunciads</hi> the more Saleable: Yet theſe Men had at leaſt ſo much Decency,
as to do this under feign'd Names, or by pointing at Perſons only by
their initial Letters, which were lyable to various Readings. Thus,
whilſt the Obſcurity of their Scandal ſcreen'd them from Puniſhment,
their very Proceeding was a tacit Confeſſion of the Guilt of ſuch
Invectives. But it was doubtleſs reſerv'd for the <hi>Modeſt</hi> Author of the
<hi>Dunciad</hi> to invent the <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> of Scandal, by calling Men, every
Way his Superiors, <hi>Rogues, Blockheads, Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Liars,</hi> in Print,
with their Names at length, whilſt he ſuppreſſes his own, that he
may be exempt from the Fear of a very low Puniſhment, but to
which his Ears ſeem to be legally intitled.</p>
                  <p>As this is my firſt Appearance in Print, I have hitherto eſcap'd the
Malice of this Scandalmonger's Pen, and do not now write out of any
Hatred to him, but real Love for Mankind. A Regard to Humanity,
and the Rules of Society, have rais'd in me an Indignation againſt a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who has the Inſolence to appear in Publick, in Defiance of them
all. I am reſolv'd, therefore (tho' ſuch a Procedure, with Relation to
any honeſt Man would be deteſtable) to mark him to the World; let us
examine a little into the Character of this diminutive Creature, who
makes ſo free with thoſe of other Men.</p>
                  <p>I find, that upon his firſt coming to Town, out of pure Compaſſion
for his exotick Figure, narrow Circumſtances, and humble Appearance,
the late Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> admitted him into his Society, and ſuffer'd him,
notwithſtanding his Make, to be his humble admirer at <hi>Will</hi>'s; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
finding in him a glimmering of Genius, recommended him
to ſome People of Rank, and introduc'd him to the moſt eminent Men
of Letters; which Courteſy he ſoon after repaid with a ſatyrical Copy
of Verſes on his Benefactor: This put an End to their Correſpondence
ſome Time before Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> dy'd. His Acquaintance by this
Means being made with Sir <hi>Richard Steele,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> they
likewiſe, in Compaſſion to his unhappy Form, and deſtitute Condition,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0163601700:19"/>
endeavoured to procure him a Support under both, by ſetting on Foot
a Subſcription in his Behalf; it was, indeed, for a Work, which (as
has ſince appeared) they muſt have known he was not equal to; but
they hoped, with their friendly Aſſiſtance, to have ſupply'd his Defects.
However, his Subſcriptions were no ſooner full, when the little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Urchin, no longer able to contain his Malice, wrote a Satyr
upon both theſe Gentlemen, (as he did afterwards an abuſive Libel on
one of them;) and as many Things which had paſs'd in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
at <hi>Button</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, came to be known by the Lord <hi>O<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>_…</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
of which Infidelity <hi>Scriblerus</hi> was ſuſpected, he was obliged to abſent
himſelf for ſome Years from thence. After this, he liſted openly in the
<hi>Tory</hi> Service, and every Week publiſh'd ſcandalous Invectives on thoſe
very <hi>Whigs,</hi> who had been his ampleſt <hi>Subſcribers.</hi> He was in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Occupation, when the late Queen dy'd; and our Poet ſoon
changing his Note, found Means to be introduced to ſome of the young
Ladies of the Court. Four of theſe, who were his beſt Friends and
Patroneſſes, (as they are to any Thing that carries the Face of Wit or
Learning) he abuſed in a Scurvy Ballad, for which any other Man
would have received Correction; but in his Caſe, theſe generous Ladies
contented themſelves with ſhewing a Contempt of his Malice, and
baniſhing him their Company. This did not hinder him from wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a ſecond Lampoon, wherein he ſpared not the moſt exalted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
though under feigned Names; and adding Treachery to Ill-Nature,
he threw the ſcandalous Imputation of having wrote this
Libel, on a Lady of Quality, whoſe Wit is equal to her Beauty, and
whoſe Character might have ſuffer'd by this impudent Forgery of his.
But I begin to be tired, as I believe your Lordſhip is too, with raking
into the dirty Parts of this foul Character. I ſhall therefore paſs over
the many other low Scenes of his Life, to come to his Maſter-piece
of Scandal, the <hi>DUNCIAD.</hi> This miſhapen Lump of Malice and
Ill-nature, at the earneſt Requeſt of all his Friends, who feared his
Abuſe more than his Enemies, had for ſome Years forborn writing
Lampoons, except it were on a <hi>Curl</hi> or a <hi>Lintot</hi>; when at laſt, grown
weary of this Reſtraint, and unable to live in Peace with Society, he
collected a Liſt of Names, yet unabuſed by him, and reſolved to throw
them together into one Satyr. To furniſh himſelf, therefore, with
Matter, he went round all his Cully Bookſellers, enquiring for Scandal of
any Kind; and an abuſive Story being told him, of a Parſon in Drink,
which the Relater thought could not come within his Scheme of Satyr,
as reflecting upon one that had never appear'd in Print; he told him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0163601700:20"/>
that he was reſolved to put it down to <hi>Laurus</hi>; for as to the <hi>Truth</hi>
of it, the Town would never be at the Trouble to enquire into
that.</p>
                  <p>Thus compiled, and thus compoſed, the <hi>DUNCIAD</hi> made its
Appearance laſt Summer, and was ſo univerſally exploded for its wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Ill-nature and Falſhood, that the Gentlemen traduced in it, being
only pointed at by their Initial Letters, did not think it worth their
Care to correct the Author, in the Manner he deſerv'd. Yet I have
been credibly inform'd, that ſome of them reſorted to no Place where
<hi>Scriblerus</hi> might poſſibly be met with, without the Proviſion of a Rod,
to whip this <hi>Old Boy,</hi> for his untoward Malice. But he abſconding for
above a Month, and the Scandal having hurt no Creature, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himſelf, their Reſentment cool'd; and the little Lampooner might
have been at Peace, had he not wantonly reviv'd the Memory of his
former Malice, by reprinting this pitiful Poem on Royal Paper, giving
at full Length the Names of moſt of thoſe mention'd in It; together
with a Comment more abuſive than the Text; which he publiſhed
under an Appellation very proper to himſelf, I mean that of <hi>Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus.</hi>
This was ſuch a conſummate Piece of Inſolence, as one would
think could admit of no Aggravation; yet he found Means to add one
Degree of Impudence more to it, by preſuming at firſt to make Men
of Rank and Quality, in a Manner, his <hi>Publiſhers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Lordſhip may wonder, that one, who has conducted himſelf
after this Manner, ſhould not have ſuffer'd under the due Correction of
ſome of thoſe, whom he has thus wantonly abuſed. It is moſt certain,
that nothing in the Figure of a Man, could have eſcaped Puniſhment,
for ſuch repeated Inſults, many of them on Perſons of Diſtinction. But
this Poetaſter having unhappily a Reſemblance in his Size and Make, to
the Animal much inferior to Man; it ſeems he has been univerſally
look'd upon, as beneath the Dignity of Reſentment. Upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
I cannot but call to Mind a Story (which I have ſomewhere read)
of an honeſt Highlander, who was walking along <hi>Holborn,</hi> when he
heard a Voice cry, <hi>Rogue Scot, Rogue Scot,</hi> his Northern Blood fired at
the Inſult, and he drew his broad Sword, looking round him on every
Side, to diſcover the Object of his Indignation, when at laſt he found
that the Voice came from a Parrot, perch'd on a Balcony within his Reach;
But the <hi>Generous Scot,</hi> diſdaining to ſtain his Truſty Blade with ſuch
ignoble Blood, put up his Sword again, with a ſour Smile, ſaying, <hi>Gin
ye were a Mon, as ye're a Green Geuſe, I would ſplit your Weem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0163601700:21"/>
A Sword, indeed, has never been deem'd a Weapon fit for the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Libellers. <hi>Therſites,</hi> who, in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Homer,</hi> reſembles
our Author, both in Shape and Malice, was cudgell'd by <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> for
his faucy Language to his Betters. <hi>Aretin,</hi> the only Author, beſides
that of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> within theſe Three Hundred Years, that acquired
a famous Infamy by his Pen, bragg'd of keeping many Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
tributary to him, in order to purchaſe an Exemption from his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
Yet it ſeems, ſome of the Princes of his own Country found out
a better Method of dealing with him; for having been abuſed by him,
they order'd the inſolent Creature ſuch a Baſtinado, as at once put an
End to his Satyrical Vein. And being by this Treatment brought to
himſelf, he had ſuch a true Senſe of his vile Character, that he turned
his Mind wholly toward Devotion: In which Strain he wrote many
Books with ſuch Succeſs, as to obtain at length, the Name of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Aretin.</hi> Should the like Treatment of the Father of the <hi>Dunciad</hi>
produce the like Effect, what Service might he not be of to Religion,
by compoſing Pious Hymns, for the great Feſtivals of the Year, and
perhaps by a Tranſlation of all the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the firſt of which, it ſeems,
he has already imitated in a moſt edifying Manner? Were <hi>Scriblerus</hi> to
undertake the whole <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and perform that Work with the Juſtneſs
and Accuracy of his other Tranſlations, it might not only eclipſe <hi>Stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
and <hi>Hopkins,</hi> but even vie with that of <hi>Tate</hi> and <hi>Brady</hi>: And
then, what would not the Publick owe to thoſe, who, by the <hi>Human</hi>
Means of a Stick, ſhould have wrought ſo uſeful, as well as <hi>praeter natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
a <hi>Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Aretin</hi> had the Shape of a Man, and might bear a <hi>Beating</hi>;
whereas, our Poet muſt of Neceſſity expire under the very firſt Blow;
and he can, by the Structure of his Perſon, only be liable to one Sort
of Correction, that of the <hi>Rod</hi>; which ſome Years ago Mr. <hi>Ambroſe
Philips,</hi> being abuſed by him, bought for his Uſe, and ſtuck up at
the Bar of <hi>Button</hi>'s Coffee-houſe; and which he avoided by his uſual
Practice after every Lampoon, of remaining a cloſe Priſoner at Home.
The ſame Diſcipline was prepar'd for him laſt Summer, which he
eſcap'd in the Manner abovementioned; and I am inform'd, that the
Rods are now ready for his Chaſtiſement, as ſoon as he ſhall be
found in a proper Place for whipping.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, as all Criminals who fly from Juſtice are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in <hi>Effigie,</hi> his Figure is expoſed, and four Inſcriptions under it,
on the ſeveral Sides of the Pedeſtal, in <hi>Greek, Latin, Spaniſh,</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> In the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> for having offended thoſe Languages,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0163601700:22"/>
by preſuming to tranſlate or imitate what he did not underſtand:
And in his native Tongue, for having made his <hi>Britiſh</hi> Muſe, which
ought to be chaſte and delicate, to ſpeak the Language of the Stews,
and of <hi>Billingſgate.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh Inſcription</hi> carries in it an Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which might have been of uſe to him had he read it, before he
became a <hi>Libeller</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Satyriſt.</hi> This curious Image having
been communicated to me, by one of thoſe who are abuſed in the
<hi>Dunciad,</hi> in whoſe Poſſeſſion it now is, I thought it proper to take
a Cut from it, which I have prefix'd to this Publication.</p>
                  <p>Whenſoever it happens, that a worthy Mind is lodg'd in a deform'd
Body, I am perſwaded that all vertuous Men commiſerate the Caſe,
and far from indulging any Reflections on the Figure, would uſe
their utmoſt Endeavours to make both the Owner and the reſt of the
World forget it: But when, as is the ſad Fate of the Author of
the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> a crooked Carcaſs is become the Habitation of a much
more crooked Mind; and when this Creature, far from being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the irregularity of the Form aſſign'd him by Providence,
makes the very Deſpicableneſs of it a Protection to him, for venting
ſuch Malice, as he would not dare to utter, were he a poſſible Mark for
Indignation to lay hold of. I think, in ſuch a Caſe, Mind and Body,
which ſeem ſo well adapted to each other, ſhould go together, and
be jointly exhibited and expos'd to the Contempt of that Society,
which can have no other Reparations made them, for the Injuries of
ſuch an untoward Animal.</p>
                  <p>A vertuous Man has ſtrongly implanted in him a Philanthropy or
innate Humanity, which reſtrains him from reflecting too ſeverely
on the Frailties of his Fellow Creatures, as remembring, that they are
all of them of one Species. But <hi>Scriblerus</hi> diſtinguiſhed indeed, in a
moſt remarkable Manner, by Nature, from the reſt of Mankind; has no
Tenderneſs or Regard for them, but looks upon himſelf as one of a quite
different Race of Beings; nor ſhall I ever look upon him in another
Light.</p>
                  <p>Where, indeed, is the Definition of <hi>Man,</hi> to which he can be ſaid
to anſwer? If <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> be the Term, can he have the Aſſurance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to that Characteriſtick, who looks with Envy on every Thing
that contributes to the Peace or Benefit of Society, and is never happy,
but when he is creating Feuds and Animoſities even amongſt the
moſt intimate of his Acquintance? If Man be ſtiled a <hi>Rational</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
will <hi>Scriblerus</hi> come within that Deſcription, who knowing how
little able he is to defend either his own Character or Perſon, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0163601700:23"/>
begins the Attack on others? <hi>Man</hi> is often defined to be a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Animal</hi>; were this meant to denote a <hi>Creature that we laugh</hi> at, the
Author of the <hi>Dunciad</hi> would bid fair to be comprehended; but all
the Grammarians agree, that it ſignifies an <hi>Animal ſuſceptible of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which, <hi>Scriblerus</hi> was never in good Humour enough, with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or others, to be, nor has he been obſerv'd, ſince the Hour of his
Birth, to have riſen above a broad Grin, common to him with the
Quadrupede, moſt reſembling Human Nature. Thus, whatſoever is the
Definition, He ſtill appears excluded from the Human Species, which
may in ſome Meaſure account for, as well as excuſe his univerſal
ill Will to our Race.</p>
                  <p>As I find that this laſt pompous Edition of the <hi>Dunciad</hi> is in <hi>Quarto,</hi>

reclaim, although ſome Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
have aſſerted, not without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Reaſon, that it ought to
have been call'd, <hi>The Martinee,</hi> in
Imitation of the <hi>Odyſſee.</hi> This Poem,
like That, being Hiſtorical, and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told, and in no Means riſing to the
Epic Force of the <hi>Iliad.</hi> But as our
laſt Modern Claſſic <hi>Scriblerus,</hi> hath
ſurmounted this Difficulty, and call'd
his the <hi>Dunciad</hi>; we fear not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Guidance of ſo eſtabliſh'd an
Author, eſpecially as he is the Hero
of our Poem, and ſo ſtile this the
<hi>Martiniad.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>At Twickenham</hi>; read <hi>Twick'nam,</hi> or
<hi>Twitt'nam.</hi> This Village is at preſent
honour'd with the Reſidence of a
ſmall modern Claſſic, and of ſome of
his Poetical Underlings and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.
It is moſt pleaſantly ſituated,
on the Banks of the Great River
<hi>Thames,</hi> and hath been celebrated in
<hi>Lyric</hi> Poetry, by the late Mr. <hi>Thomas
D'Urfey,</hi> who, in his <hi>Richmond Balls,</hi>

               <hi>A little Pariſh Clerk.</hi> That Office
requiring a Talent in Vociferation,
the ſame is moſt elegantly inſinuated
under the Epithet <hi>Little,</hi> it being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Adage, <hi>Little and Loud.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>And</hi> Martin Scribler <hi>was his Name.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>He was not like the Generality of
Clerks, content with reading or ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Works of other Men, but
likewiſe compoſed many of his own.
And perhaps too audaciouſly as well
as too ludicrouſly invaded the Sacred
Province of <hi>King David,</hi> by vying with
him in Pſalmody. Tho' I am told,
that our <hi>Martin</hi> went no farther than
the Firſt Pſalm, not having met with
any Sort of Encouragement in that
Undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Steeple Crown'd.</hi> A moſt adequate

               </gap> Reſemblance to a Steeple,
inaſmuch as both are intended for the
Omament of the Church. What
<hi>Church Scribler's Steeple-Crown</hi> now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorneth,
is as much a Queſtion, as it
was anciently what City might claim
the Birth of <hi>Homer.</hi> However, it
ſhould ſeem by the <hi>Crown</hi> being its
ſelf a <hi>Steeple,</hi> that <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>Typical
Head</hi> belonged to ſome <hi>Church</hi> that
claimed to <hi>itſelf</hi> the Supremacy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cricket</hi>'s <hi>Voice.</hi> This is an Animal
famous for the Smallneſs of his Voice
and Legs. He is obſerved to creep
into the Chimneys of old Houſes,
where there is much Filth and Naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and where the Walls are full of
Holes. Hence, Men, who get into
Families only to pick up Scandal, and
find out their Flaws, are often aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to <hi>Crickets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monkey's Brain.</hi> This is not to be
underſtood in a literal Senſe, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically.
And as Monkeys are
commonly miſchievous Mimicks, we
are to underſtand thoſe Diſpoſitions
to have been in our Pariſh-Clerk.</p>

            <p>From this one Inſtance, the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

is a Word which adds to

               <hi>This Loon. Loon</hi> in <hi>Minſhew,</hi> is ſaid

               <hi>Beauk learn'd Scot.</hi> Here our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
in ſpeaking of a <hi>Scotchman,</hi>
very humorouſly and elegantly falls
into the very Dialect of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
doubtleſs in Imitation of the

this Error being once crept in, the

               <head>A Curious Receipt, wherein is diſcloſed,
the Art of writing Poetry with a ſmall

SCRIBLERUS's</hi> Writings.</head>
               <p>READER, be thou Gentle, or be thou otherwiſe, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thy Profit and Pleaſure before mine Eyes, from the
which I ſhall not readily ſwerve, elſe mayeſt Thou, in all
Probability, caſt me off, as is uſually practic'd with unprofitable
Servants. As I have by my Sagacity diſcover'd certain mechanical
Rules, by the Help whereof <hi>Scriblerus</hi> hath obtained unto himſelf
the Name of a mighty Poet: I queſtion not, but the imparting
the ſame unto Thee, will be of Contentment and Delight. It may
furthermore be a Work conducive toward the Strength and Glory of
this my native Iſland, by multiplying the Number of Poets therein.
Theſe have hitherto been but few, from a miſtaken Opinion, that a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Learning, and a good Ear, were requiſite to conſtitute a Poet;
whereas, from the following plain and eaſy Rules, it will moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear, that Application and Practice only are neceſſary. By the
Help of theſe, I will undertake, that any induſtrious <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> may,
in the Space of one Month, become as great a Verſificator, as even the
Great <hi>Scriblerus</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Let the Man then, whoſe ſublime Paſſion it is to ſhine in Poeſy,

moſt effectually perform'd, by ſelecting Words, that begin with the ſame
Conſonant, and theſe placed at due Diſtances, Two, Three, or more,
in one and the ſame Verſe, create a Muſick in Poetry, inſomuch,
as that the Lines ſo compoſed, may be indifferently, either <hi>ſung</hi> or
<hi>ſaid.</hi> Of a Truth, this is an Art, which ſeemeth to have eſcaped
the Knowledge of all the Antients, whether of <hi>Greece</hi> or of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and was hidden from the moſt celebrated even of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Poets,
being, like many other ineſtimable Secrets, wrapt in the dark <hi>Womb</hi> of
Time, to be brought to Light only by the ſkilfull <hi>Midwifery</hi> of the
Renowned <hi>Scriblerus.</hi> Some Traces, indeed, there are of this Art,
amongſt ſome of the Monkiſh Writers, from whence our Poet may
have taken the Hint. But the Monks never reduc'd the ſame to any
regular Practice (as our modern Claſſick hath done) nor did they
make uſe thereof in any but <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes, and thoſe chiefly <hi>Technical</hi>
ones, for the Help of Memory: So that the Invention, or at leaſt
the Perfection of this <hi>Noſtrum,</hi> is owing to <hi>Martinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conformable to his Rules, were I to mention an Author, whoſe Pride
could bear no Fame but his own, and that of his ſervile Flatterers,
I would make the Verſes run thus,

               <p>I might give a thouſand more Inſtances of the ſame Nature, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there are not any two Lines together, in the whole <hi>Dunciad,</hi>
or in any other of the <hi>Writings</hi> of this Author, wherein the ſame
<hi>mechanical Trick</hi> is not practiſed: And it is from thence that
He hath acquir'd the Name of <hi>Melodious Martin,</hi> and not, as hath
been falſely inſinuated from his having ſung his own Pſalm in a
certain Lutheran Congregation, the which we eſteem of, only as a
fictitious Tale devis'd for Mirth, it being well known, that our Poet
belongeth to a much more ancient <hi>Church.</hi> But to return to our
Subject. Whoſoever, by an unwearied Exerciſe in Vocabularies
and Dictionaries of Rhyme, ſhall have repleniſh'd the Tubes of his
Memory with Similar Sounds, will, in Proportion to his Application
and Labour therein, rival, or even ſurpaſs, if poſſible, the Merit of
our Great <hi>Martinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any Perſon, moderately vers'd in Poetical Works, muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd,
that Adjectives are moſt commonly foiſted in, not to add to
the Senſe, but in order to fill up the Meaſure of a Verſe. In all
ſuch Emergencies, it behoveth our Apprentice in Poeſy, to make a moſt
fervent Search for an Adjective, that beginneth with the ſame Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as his Subſtantive, even although the Context ſhould ſeem to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thereby. Thus muſt <hi>Comfort</hi> always be cold, the <hi>Day</hi> at Noon
<hi>Dawning,</hi> the <hi>Fury</hi> even of <hi>Scriblerus Fatal, Garments Gorgeous</hi> though
all tatter'd, <hi>Head Heavy, Limbs Lazy, Mind Muddy, Night Noiſy,</hi>
                  <hi>Plight Pleaſing</hi> be it never ſo ſad, <hi>Quail Quivering, Rake Reeling</hi> tho'
ſober, <hi>Sot Social,</hi> and <hi>Treat</hi> or <hi>Theobald Taſteleſs.</hi> True it is, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0163601700:33"/>
this ingenious Gentleman hath manifeſted as good a Taſte as any of
our Writers whatſoever; but what hath Truth to do with <hi>Scriblerick</hi>
Poetry? His Name, and <hi>Taſteleſs,</hi> both commence with the ſame Letter;
and therefore, untill He ſhall preſent us with a more convenient Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,
beginning with a T, He muſt be contented with this abuſive
and unjuſt one, <hi>Euphoniae Gratia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Adjectives, or others in their Stead, having been choicely
collected, as has been premis'd, out of the Dictionary, conſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
being had to the initial Conſonant, they muſt at ſometimes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
precede or follow their Reſpective Subſtantives, and at others
may be ſever'd at a due Diſtance from the ſame, from whence
will reſult a moſt delectable Variety of Harmony. For the firſt Sort,
take this <hi>Example,</hi>

muſt ſuffice to give Thee full Light into this Myſtery; the Reſt
muſt be the Reſult of thine own Diligence in putting this Precept
Properly in Practice.</p>
               <p>Proceed we then to certain other mechanical Rules, whereby great
and eminent Poets may be produc'd, without the Help of Genius. In
the ſecond Place therefore the
<q>— Hiatus in M. S. valde Deflendus</q>
               </p>
               <p>Although in this Place there be a Gap in our Manuſcript, which can
never enough be lamented by the Learned, yet are there preſerv'd
to us many Fragments of the ſame, containing moſt curious Secrets;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0163601700:35"/>
but as they are replete with Quotations from <hi>Scriblerus,</hi> I muſt defer
exhibiting them 'till a more convenient Seaſon. I think in the long
Winter Nights, in which all well regulated Families aſſemble round
the Chimney, a Preſent of this Nature may not be uncomfortable.
At ſuch a Seaſon, ſhould any one, endued with an even ſteady Voice,
read the many Excerptions out of <hi>Scriblerus,</hi> contain'd in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Parts of this Manuſcript, what with the genial Warmth of
the Fire, the Lullaby whiſtling of the Wind, and the <hi>Monotony,</hi> or
Sameneſs of Sound in the Verſes, That Slumber might effectually
be procur'd, which is ſo ſoporiferouſly deſcrib'd in the ſecond Book
of the <hi>Dunciad.</hi> Perhaps that good Effect might be produc'd at this
very Hour, without any concurring Helps, were it poſſible to find
People, whoſe Blood in Spring ran ſluggiſh enough to ſit ſtill and
hear ſuch a <hi>Work</hi> read to them.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the great Veneration I have for the Author of the
preceding Manuſcript, yet muſt I beg leave to animadvert on one
Aſſertion therein, which I take to be erroneous; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Divine
Art of Ingemination of Sounds</hi> in Poeſy, was the ſole Invention of
<hi>Martinus Scriblerus</hi>; whereas, in Juſtice to the Memory of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
Mr. <hi>John Grub,</hi> the Great Founder of the Street and Sect,
which ſtill bear his Name, I ſhall venture to affirm, that he was no
Stranger to this Myſtery. This will moſt evidently appear by a moſt
curious Fragment of his, which I ſhall here ſubjoin; and which,
perhaps, may be a Preſent as welcome to the Publick, as thoſe many
Books of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> ſaid to have been lately retriev'd by the Fidelity
of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Library Keeper, who may well be ſtyl'd the
<hi>Bentley</hi> of the Eaſt. Such is the Beauty of the Allegory, couch'd
in the few Lines of our Fragment, and ſuch the Harmony of its
Verſification, as may juſtly entitle it to a Place in the next <hi>Edition</hi>
of the <hi>Dunciad.</hi> The Verſes of Mr. <hi>Grub</hi> are as follow.</p>
