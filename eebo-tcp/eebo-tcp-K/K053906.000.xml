            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Respect to Age.</head>
            <p>In the Panathenaea, (a course of solemn games at Athens) an old Athenian came late to the theatre, and found it difficult to procure a seat. The audience even made a jest of him, calling to him <hi>Here is room;</hi> and sitting close when he came fo the spot, so as always to reject him. The old man, being in great distress, not only with toiling along, but with being made a public laughing stock, at length came to the seats of the Spartans, who, all rising to a man, gave him the best place among them. At this, the whole theatre resounded with shouts of applause; and the old Athenian rising up, exclaimed, "the Athenians <hi>know</hi> what is right, but the Spartans <hi>practise</hi> it."</p>

            <p>A slave of Omer, the viceroy, ſled from his service, but was retaken, and brought before the king; who, at Omer's instigation, condemned him to death.

The weather was uncommonly sultry, and as the warmth of his imagination corresponded with the fervor without, his poetry could not fail to be uncommonly <hi>glowing.</hi> He accordingly began as follows:</p>

He had proceeded thus far, when Phoebus, whose beams are sometimes found to inspire sleep as well as genius, exerted the former power upon him with such effect, that in a few minutes he sunk back motionless in his chair. A fellow collegian coming into the room while the poet was in this situation, and seeing from the paper which was laying before him, the nature of his employment, he immediately added two other lines to the above, in order to complete the verse. The <hi>man of genius,</hi> awaking soon after, to his utter astonishment and confusion read as follows:</p>

morning, and running about the room in a ſit of joy, told him his fortune was made! "How so, Jack?" says the doctor. "Why," says Jack, "the Duchess of Marlborough, you must know, has long had a strange penchant for a pair of white mice; and as I knew they were sometimes to be had in the East-Indies, I commissioned a friend of mine, who was going out then, to get them for me, and he this morning arrived with two of the most beautiful little animals in nature." After Jack had finished this account with a transport of joy, he lengthened his visage, by telling the doctor all was ruined, for without two guineas to buy a cage for the mice, he could not present them. The doctor, unfortunately, as he said himself, had but half a guinea in the world, which he offered to lend him. But Pilkington was not to be beat out of his scheme; he perceived the doctor's watch hanging up in his room, and, after premising on the indelicacy of the proposal, hinted, that "if he could spare that watch for a week, he could raise a few guineas on it, which he would pay him with gratitude. The doctor would not be the means of spoiling a man's fortune for such a trifle. He accordingly took down the watch, and gave it to him; which Jack immediately took to the pawnbroker's, raised what he could on it, and never once looked after the doctor, till he sent to borrow another half guinea from him on his death bed, which the doctor very generously sent him.</p>

Upon which, one of the spectators, who stood there with a load upon his head, seeing the offender so dexterous, said, "It is my opinion this fellow has served his time to the pillory, he is so handy about it." To which a droll rogue in a leather apron replied, "Served his time to it! You may be sure he has; do you not see that he has set up for himself?" "Set up!" said another, "how can that be set up, when he stands?" "Why you foolish dog," rejoined the second who spoke, "do you not know it is a standing business?" And now a fellow in a woollen cap calls out to the man in the pillory, "Harkee, cocky," said he, "had you not rather the jokes should fly about than the rotten eggs?" "Aye, sure, master," replies the man, "though it was on account of some sort of jokes I got my head into this hole." At this time a barrow woman added one more to the assembly; when a porter accosts her with, "Well, Moll, what brought you here?" To which she returned, "Curiosity, and my legs, Jack; now I hope the fool's answered." "Fool!" says the fellow, "what do you mean by that, you slut?" "Why," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined she, "you must be a fool because you can neither read nor write." "Very true," answered the porter, "but I can set my mark;" and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately striking her in the face, gave her a black eye: this brought on a battle between the porter and a man who took the woman's part; when the Frenchman, seeing the English fight like bull-dogs, said, "The English shine in <hi>war</hi> as well as <hi>wit.</hi>"</p>

"Why, truly," replied he with frankness, "it is all owing to my bungling blockhead of a valet, who takes up such an unconscionable time in dressing my hair that I am glad to read to keep from fretting; and as there are no newspapers or magazines to be had in this country, I have been driven to history, which answers nearly as well."</p>

            <head>Method of Selling a Wife. A Fact.</head>
            <p>The method of selling a wife, which I understand from experience, is for the head of the man to be ornamented with horns, and a collar round his neck, to which a ring and cord is fastened; the auction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eer is to lead the husband, and he the wife with a halter about her neck: Thus led a couple met me as I was taking a roam round the adjacent parts of a village in Yorkshire, curiosity led me to be one of the spectators. The auctioneer began to proceed to business, by informing the company present, that the parting was by mutual consent, to which the parties bowed approbation: He then put up the lot consisting of the lady and a purse of ten guineas, but found by sad experience that there was no demand for the article.—"A going, a going," said the auctioneer; "I assure you, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you loose an excellent opportunity of making your fortune, and promoting future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; the money you bid is not near the value of the purse attached to the lot. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after knocked down the article to a sedate old bachelor, who paid the money out of the purse and march'd off, amidst the acclamations of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thousand spectators.</p>

            <head>Eastern Hospitality.</head>
            <p>An infidel prince was brought captive before the caliph Haroun Al Raschid, who advised him to embrace the faith of Mahomet, which he refused; upon which he commanded him to be put to death. "Let me not die thirsty," said the prince. The caliph ordered him a cup of cold water. "Let the executioner," said the prince, "put up his sword till I have drank it." The caliph did so. The prince drank a little, and poured the rest on the ground; after which he exclaimed, "Now, O caliph, put me to death." The caliph dared not to sin against the rights of hospitality, yet wished to punish a dangerous foe. He consulted a casuis; who advised him to keep the prince in solitary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment during his life. The prince, on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this sentence, immediately became a mussul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

            <p>A Spanish ambassador going on his mission to Africa, lodged in his way at a convent in Navarre, where many insane people were accommodated. One person, who appeared rational, told the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador that his relations had shut him up there, and that their interest at court had detained him there, though he had given several proofs of a sound mind; and begged his grace to apply to the king for his release. The ambassador pitied the man,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0076501700:39"/>
really judging him to be ill used; and promised him to apply to his majesty, if he would tell him his name. "I am," replied the maniac, "the angel Gabriel, who carried the message from heaven to the Virgin Mary." On his progress, he lodged a second time in Granada, at a monastery of the same description, and fell into discourse with one of the lunatics, whose story was, that he had done eminent services to the king of Spain, and that his son, in order to take possession of his estate, had confined him among madmen; and he begged his grace, on application to his majesty, to obtain his release. The ambassador mentioned to him his former commission from the angel Gabriel. "Do not mind that fool, my lord; he is a liar: for if he had been the angel, I should have known it, as I am God the Father himself."—Great care should be taken to keep madmen from the palaces of kings.

"Who's there?" said a voice. "I have brought you a subject," replied the man, "so come, quick, give me my fee." The money was immediately paid, and sack, with its contents, deposited in the surgery. The motion of quick had pretty nearly recovered the poor victim, who, before the other had been gone five minutes, began to endeavour to extricate himself from the sack.

            <p>A servant bringing a tongue into a room, it slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from the plate, and fell on the ground. His master was angry, but relented when the fellow begged pardon, for, he said, "it was only a slip

of the tongue" The answer so pleased the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that they clubbed shillings a-piece to reward his wit. Another servant, desiring a like recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, took an opportunity, when bring up a rump of beef, to let it fall in like manner, and said, "<hi>it was only a slip of the tongue.</hi> But he was dismissed; and forced to pay for cleaning the carpet.</p>

            <p>A poor Limosin being at Paris, saw a very little lap-dog sold for four crowns, and made this reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: "If so little a dog brings so large a price, what must a large dog bring?"
