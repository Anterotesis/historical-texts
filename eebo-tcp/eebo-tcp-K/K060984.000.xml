            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Confeſs, the Occaſions of my appearing in Print again u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this Subject, are unexpected; and as the writing a <hi>Fifth Eſſay</hi> is Contrary to my real Deſign, and more ſo to my Inclination, I cannot but ſay ſomething by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to it.</p>
            <p>The Management of this preſent Treaty, I mean, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors, has ſomething in it peculiarly odd, and to me very ſurprizing; Reaſon and Argument, nay even De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration cannot reach it; Men will argue againſt, nay Banter, and be Witty upon the ſeveral Branches, &amp; yet at the end of the Diſcourſe profeſs, They do not Underſtand them—They will be ſilenc't, and yet not at all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't; they wont believe, when they cannot reply; when they own, they gain by it, they are not pleaſed; when they fancy, they are Loſers, they are fond of Complaining; and when they can't make it out, rail on thoſe that Endeavour to Confute them.</p>
            <p>Words can have no Effect on ſuch Perſons, no Argument can touch them; either they Can't, or Won't, Underſtand any thing but what they like. Bitterneſs poſſeſſes their Souls, and breaks out too much at their Tongues: and I
<pb facs="tcp:0386703300:3"/>
muſt tell them, I think, I bear more than my Share of this from them too, and that without Cauſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis hard, Gentlemen, that an Attempt calmly to remove Prejudices (and I am ſure, I have done it both Calmly and Cautiouſly) ſhould fill any Body with Prejudices at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. <hi>Scotland</hi> has been in ſome Reputation for Courteſy to Strangers, &amp; I ſhould be very ſorry, you ſhould break in upon that part of your Character, only with a Reconciler. An Attempt to remove Prejudices, can have nothing in it; unleſs that the Truths ſpoken, move the Spleen of ſome, who would not be reconciled, and therefore cannot bear the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>Nor would I be miſtaken here, I am far from being Concern'd at the Ribauldry of the Street, calling my Name about to every Ballad, making me the Author of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers I never ſaw; when Gentlemen lampoon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, calling it mine, and the like, this is an old Method taken with me, and I am uſed to it.—<q>
                  <l>My Muſe muſt be the Whore of Poetry,</l>
                  <l>And all <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Baſtards laid to me.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentlemen are wellcome, and the Mob of Writers by all their Witticiſms, ſhall only provoke me to Silence. I remember, and I wiſh, ſome other Gentlemen here would take the hint as I do—My Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> adviſing
<pb facs="tcp:0386703300:4"/>
My Lord—not to reply to Satyr and Lampoon, has theſe two Merry Lines.<q>
                  <l>Fellows that ne'er were Heard or read of,</l>
                  <l>If thou writ'ſt on, will write thy head off.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Others, I am told, are furniſhing themſelves with Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and Deſign to anſwer my Arguments with Perſonal Reflection.</p>
            <p>I thank GOD, my Life, however mixt with Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, has not been ſuch, that I am aſham'd to ſee it in Print. Nor ſhall I offer any Capitulations with ſuch Gentlemen, only intreat them for their own Sakes, to ſay nothing but what is true:—and then to add at the Bottom of their Story, what mighty Signification it has to the Argument in hand.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour had healed the Man born blind, and he, appearing before the Elders, anſwered them with a Teſtimony to the Divinity of the Healer, which they could not reply to, <hi>viz.</hi> That he muſt be GOD, ſince nothing of a Man could ha' wrought ſuch a Cure—To anſwer the Conviction of his Reaſoning, they fall upon the Poor Man, <hi>Thou wer't altogether born in ſin and doeſt thon teach us—and they Caſt him Out</hi>—and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all what the Poor Man ſaid, was very true—</p>
            <p>Now Gentlemen, if what I ſay be true, why will you not hear it? if not true, why will ye not anſwer it?—
<pb facs="tcp:0386703300:5"/>
Let the Author be never ſo Deſpicable or Mean in your Eyes, he is in no Man's meaner than in his Own: but Truth in the meaneſt Hand, deſerves your Regard; Accept the Truth, and uſe the Author as you like, he is perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd about that.</p>
            <p>But all this does not yet reach the Matter which I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of: But I think it hardeſt, when Gentlemen, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to anſwer what pinches them in Fact, Charge me with Falſities, wrong repreſenting things &amp; the like, &amp; to make it out, give their own Aſſertions only, without the leaſt Proof either to make Good their own, or Detect mine.</p>
            <p>When Gentlemen reflect on what I have wrote, as not true, and uſe me ill on that head, at the ſame time contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting it, with nothing but what is manifeſtly falſe, impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the World their own Affirmative without Proof againſt Arguments, which are, and can be prov'd by Undoubted and undeniable Authority; this, I muſt own, is uſing a Stranger very ill.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give but two or three Inſtances of this here, and ſhall meet with the reſt as I go.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> Here's a Gentleman tells me in Print, That the ſmall Beer in <hi>England</hi> does pay more than 1 <hi>ſh.</hi> 3. <hi>d. per</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel if ſold for above 6 <hi>ſh: per</hi> Barrel; that the Foreign Salt payes 10 <hi>ſh: per</hi> Buſbel Cuſtom, that there are Duties &amp; Reſtrictions on the Export of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture and the like. And this the Gentleman calls a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing my Fourth Eſſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0386703300:6"/>
Now as this wants but a ſhort Anſwer, ſo that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will detect the Gentleman's Ignorance <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> his forwardneſs of Charging me vvithout Proof.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Act of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> preſcribes the Exciſe to only tvvo Denominations of Beer, Small and Strong, and that the Small Beer is ſtrictly call'd 6 <hi>ſh:</hi> Beer: and I ſuppoſe in Charity to him, that he looked no further than the Letter of the Act.</p>
            <p>But if he thinks fit to examine the Practice in <hi>England,</hi> and the Nature of the thing, he will find three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That there is no Small Beer ſold in <hi>England</hi> at 6 Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel.</item>
               <item>2. That the Houſhold Beer ſold in <hi>London,</hi> and Parts adjacent at 10 <hi>ſh. per</hi> Barrel, and ſome at 12 <hi>ſh. per</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, pays no more Exciſe than as Small Beer, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>ſh.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel; and of this I can bring him ſeveral Witneſſes of People of both Nations now here.</item>
               <item>3. That by the Nature of the Act, it can be no otherwiſe, ſince the Act does not ſay, all Beer above 6 ſs. ſhall pay as Strong Beer, but the word, Strong Beer, is governed by the Uſage of Exciſe, and is all ſold as Ale from 18 <hi>ſh. per</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to above 40 <hi>ſh.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>If it is <hi>asked</hi> me, Why the Act calls it 6 <hi>ſh.</hi> Beer? I <hi>anſwer,</hi> Becauſe, that Act having been made above 30 Year ago, the Small Beer in thoſe days, was ſold at that price; and this Exciſe being but in two Heads or Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb facs="tcp:0386703300:7"/>
as before, the Term needed no Alteration, tho' the price of Sale was riſen: ſince it follow'd by the Name of Small Beer, that nothing could pay as Strong, that had not the firſt Runnings of the Malt.</p>
            <p>I need enlarge no further, to prove the juſtice of my Calculation, or the unfairneſs of being Charg'd here with Impoſing on the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Caſe is in the ſame Gentleman's Paper, who tells me, the Duty on Foreign Salt is 10 ſs. <hi>per</hi> Buſhel; and to inſult me the more, adds, That 'tis <hi>by them that know it as well as I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as this ſhowes the Gentleman's Heat to run before his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, I muſt tell him, there can be no juſt Compariſon between any Man's Knowledge here, ſince the Acts of Parl. are plain, in which the Taxes upon Salt are ſettled, and that there may be no Diſpute on the Difference of Meaſure, the Buſhel is Determined to weigh 84 <hi>l:</hi> weight <hi>Avoir du pois,</hi> and if he pleaſes to ſearch the ſaid Acts, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book of Rates, he will find the Duty ſtands thus. <table>

            </head>
            <p>IN the laſt Eſſay, I went thro' a great many Branches of the Popular Objections raiſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt the Union.—I wiſh I could exactly diſtinguiſh between thoſe that Men raiſe only to oppoſe the Thing in General, and prevent the Uniting the Nations <hi>on any Terms whatever,</hi> and thoſe which are really offered from honeſt Scruple at the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>However, whether I can diſtinguiſh them in their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or no; I ſhall diſtinguiſh them as well as I can in the following Diſcourſe, in which I ſhall have all due regard to honeſt Reaſoning and fair Argument, but not ſo much to Cavil and Frivolous or Malicious Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>I little thought it had been poſſible that any <hi>Scots-man,</hi> at leaſt ſuch as underſtand the Affairs here, could ſay, That <hi>Scotland</hi> does not gain by <hi>England</hi> in Trade, much leſs that you do, or can Trade abroad with equal Advantages to other Nations.</p>
            <p>I could not imagine any Man would offer that it is your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Trade with <hi>France,</hi> where you bring back nothing but what drains you of Money, and ſend little thither but what you ought to keep at Home.</p>
            <p>Leſs was it to be expected, that Men ſhould publiſh in Print, that your Trade will be ruin'd by an Union with <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>

Wherefore to all theſe Heads, I ſhall ſay ſomething as plain and Conciſe as I can, if poſſible, to remove the Prejudices which are form'd in the Heads of the Ignorant, as if on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſet them in the light of your future Advantages.</p>
            <p>But before I come to this, I muſt ſay a Word or two to a mighty Champion, that has undertaken from my own Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another Caſe, to overthrow the very Foundation of the preſent Treaty, and ſetting <hi>D. F.</hi> againſt <hi>D. F.</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as he thinks, that the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> has no Power to enter upon this Treaty, nor go on with it without the Conſent of their Conſtituents that Chooſe them.</p>
            <p>And to do this, he Quotes a long Part of a Book wrote ſome time ſince in <hi>England,</hi> Entitled, <hi>The Original Right of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Body of the People of</hi> England <hi>Vindicated and Aſſerted,</hi> in Anſwer to Sir <hi>Humphra Mackworth</hi>'s Book, Called, <hi>A Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Book I lay down Four Maxims of Government, which this Gentleman Quotes, at large.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis ſo ſtrange a thing, notwithſtanding all this, That theſe Gentlemen ſhould bring this Quotation to prove the want of Power in the preſent Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, that I muſt own I never ſaw any thing fetcht ſo remote in Argument in my Life.</p>
            <p>If any Man therefore pleaſe but to Examine two things, he will ſee thro' all this Cloud of Cavil, and ſoon diſtinguiſh the Caſe.</p>
            <p>All that this long Quotation amounts to, is ſum'd up in this, That ail Government being conſtituted for the Publick Good, all the Parts of Government Ceaſing to Act for the Publick Good, ceaſe from the ſame Publick Capacity in which they were Conſtituted, the end of their Authority being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0386703300:10"/>
This only then leads us to Examine, whether the preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Scotland</hi> are Acting for the Publick Good, or no, and I ſhall be very glad to join Iſſue with any Body on that Head.</p>
            <p>The other Caſe quoted, refers to Parliaments <hi>making Laws againſt Reaſon, Nature, or the Divine Law.</hi>—And had the Author here quoted me fairly, he would have gone on and ſhow'd an Inſtance I gave to explain the reſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz. If the People of</hi> England <hi>find their Repreſentatives going about to betray the Religion and Liberties of their Country,</hi> what the ſaid People <hi>by the Laws of Reaſon, Nature and Religion ought to do?</hi> And to Illuſtrate this, I gave Inſtances of the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> alternately Re-eſtabliſhing to Day Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, to Morrow the Proteſtant Religion; to Day one King, to Morrow another; to Day declaring Queen <hi>Mary</hi> Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> a Baſtard; to Morrow Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> a Legitimate, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> a Baſtard; and from thence I argued to the Subverſion of Juſtice and Corruption of the Laws in theſe Caſes; I think all I have advanced there very Juſt and Plain, and I never yet heard it objected againſt.</p>
            <p>But with Submiſſion to this Gentleman's Underſtanding, all this proves nothing in the Caſe before us, unleſs it be alſo made appear, That the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> is acting ſomething againſt the Laws of God, Nature or Reaſon, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Laws, Corrupting Juſtice, Oppreſſing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom they ſhould protect, and betraying the Truſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them by their Country, and thus we are juſt where we were before.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Drift of my Author, appearing plainly at laſt, to Declare it ſelf for a League with <hi>France,</hi> and conſequently a Reſtoring ſome body, who <hi>this Nation, I believe, had much</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0386703300:11"/>
               <hi>better be without,</hi> it requires no further Reply than this, and therefore I leave it.</p>
            <p>I frankly own the Poſitions, this Perſon Quotes, <hi>(viz.) Of the People collectively conſidered, having a Right to oppoſe any conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Body of Government, Suppreſſing and Betraying their Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I do not ſee any thing infer'd from hence, unleſs it be firſt proved, That the Treaty now on foot, <hi>is a Betraying the Fundamentals of their Country, Overthrowing and Subverting the Laws, Perverting and Corrupting Juſtice, and a General Enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much I know has been Talkt of, to prove theſe things, but with ſo little Reaſon, and on ſuch Weak Fundations, that I think, I need ſay no more to it, till Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> or ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for him, Refutes <hi>The Scheme of the National Right of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſerted in the laſt Tract.</hi>—Wherein I have, to the beſt of my Judgment, Deſcribed it; and ſhall willingly Recant it, when I find it not able to conſiſt with Juſtice and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But before I diſmiſs this Article, and that I may give this Gentleman full ſcope for his Argument, I offer to prove, That tho' the Fundation he lays down were Juſt, <hi>which 'tis plain is otherwiſe,</hi> yet the Inference would not hold in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>For Example, ſuppoſe (which yet I by no means grant) That the People who are the Conſtituents of Parliament, were ſo far Judges of the actions of Parliament, as to have a Right to give them Inſtructions; and as a Worthy Author has it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of his wiſe Sayings, to Addreſs the Parliament <hi>COMMANDING them not to proceed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Two things muſt neceſſarily follow upon this moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Suppoſition.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That theſe People ſo Limiting the Parliament, muſt be ſuch, <hi>and only ſuch,</hi> as have a Right of Election, for they only can Direct their Repreſentatives who have a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0386703300:12"/>
Right to be Repreſented, and they only have a Right to be Repreſented, who have a Voice in the Election of a Repreſentative.</item>
            </list>
            <p> Thus, there are all your <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Armies Disbanded, and turn'd Rebels at once, and all your <hi>Dumfries</hi> Proteſtors with their Troops of Horſe and Armies of Foot, ſuch only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as have a Right to Vote in an Election.</p>
            <list>
               <item>2. Of thoſe who have a Right of Voting in Election, the Right of Contraveening the Actions of the Members, muſt depend at leaſt on the Majority of them; <hi>ſome are of the Opinion,</hi> it muſt have every Individual in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch moment: But this is certain, it muſt have a Majority, and this Majority muſt include the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity too, who are not Repreſented, but ſit in Perſon; and how ſhall it appear, that this Majority are in the Perſons now Addreſſing?</item>
            </list>
            <p>Let us Examine the Probability of it, for a certain Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>I</hi> believe impracticable now; but as to Probability when ſhall we ſee it.</p>
            <p>Some of the Addreſſes have been Signed by 6, ſome 7, 10. 12 hands, only to aſſiſt in the Clamour. Are theſe the Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Electors in the Shires or Towns? ſome have more, but 'tis where the Proportion is much greater.</p>
            <p>Let us take it in the Addreſs of the Burghs, which has been often calculated, and take the Burghs that refuſed to Addreſs, and theſe that did not think it worth while to appear, and the Majority againſt the Addreſſers, is by the Proportion of <hi>their Ceſs</hi> as 86 to 14. Nay, ſuppoſe all thoſe that did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be Affirmatives, tho' that be altogether improbable, and that they would have been for the Addreſs, yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion had been as 31 to 69.—</p>
            <p>But if <hi>the Rate of the Ceſs</hi> be not a juſt Eſtimate of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Burghs, <hi>tho I can prove it was the Original of their</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0386703300:13"/>
               <hi>Right of being Burghs;</hi> then I refer to any Man to calculate the Inhabitants and Number of Free-men in each Burgh, and he will find the 20 Burghs that refuſed to addreſs, have more Inhabitants in them than both the 24 that addreſs'd, and the 22 that were abſent, the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>And where now is the Majority? and how ſhall a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment regulate themſelves by this Method? For here a Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Shires <hi>(ſuppoſe it was ſo)</hi> addreſt againſt the Union, and a Majority of the Burghs are for it; now take the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Part of the Freeholders, and the Major Part of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, and draw a juſt Proportion of Members in the Houſe, I mean of Repreſentatives, and add theſe to the great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Lords who are for the Union, and who are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented at all, and I dare ſay, the Majority would appear for the Union.</p>
            <p>To take it another way, divide the Freeholders in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and place the Numbers of either the Repreſenting or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the Value of their Eſtates, for the Original of all depends upon the Freehold; I dare ſay, including the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, two Thirds of the Freehold of <hi>Scotland</hi> belong to ſuch as are for the Union.</p>
            <p>I care not to enter into Inviduous Compariſons, <hi>as the more exact Calculating ſuch things as theſe muſt neceſſarily come to;</hi> I leave it to thoſe that pleaſe to examine further into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority: I am perſwaded, if theſe People will have the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Freeholders of <hi>Scotland</hi> be againſt the Union, they muſt, <hi>as Mr.</hi> Hodges <hi>does,</hi> draw the Ladies into the Party; and if they are againſt it, <hi>as ſome ſay,</hi> the Reaſons they give are too light for this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I think this Eſtimate of probable Majorities as juſt as may ſupport my Arguments; I'll ſubmit them to any Man that can confute them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0386703300:14"/>
As to all the reſt of the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have no Right to elect Repreſentatives, <hi>I affirm,</hi> and think the nature of the thing demonſtrates it, They can have no Right to direct thoſe who they have no part in conſtituting.</p>
            <p>And here all the People drawn in to ſign Addreſſes to the Parliament againſt the Union, ſo far as the Members are to be bound by theſe Addreſſes, are meddling with what they have no Right to be meddling with, nor are any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, <hi>ſuppoſe SOME RIGHT of limiting the Proceedings of Parliament by their Conſtituents,</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority in one Place addreſſes them againſt an Union, and the Majority of other Places addreſſed for it or acquieſced, which is the ſame thing, What Confuſions, what intolerable Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies and Labyrinths muſt this run the Parliament into? and when ſhould any thing be reſolved, which tho of never ſo great Concern, had ſo much Difficulty in it?</p>
            <p>I leave this here, with this ſhort Remark on it, That I do not ſee, <hi>tho the Conſtituent had Power to reſtrain the Houſe,</hi> that by any Eſtimate which can be yet made, a Majority has yet appear'd willing to do ſo; if there was a Majority, it does not appear they had a Right to do it, unleſs what the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was doing, was in it ſelf deſtructive of the Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Religion or Property of the People, or ſubverting their Eſſential Privileges; and therefore hitherto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been Regular in their Proceedings, and Wiſer than to regard the Clamours of Tumultuous People, not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to interrupt them.</p>
            <p>The further Deſigns of this Author diſcovers the more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked part of the Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> Uniting, or at leaſt Confederat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Popiſh and <hi>French</hi> Tyranny—And I cannot but obſerve here, how thoſe People are pleaſing themſelves with that ſmall Advantage of Trade to <hi>France,</hi> and magnifying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0386703300:15"/>
them to unuſual Hights, <hi>tho 'tis plain the Returns from thence are all to your Dammage in general,</hi> and at the ſame time the Trade to <hi>England,</hi> the Returns of which now are chiefly in Money, and after the Union muſt be more ſo, are diſparag'd, leſſen'd and reduced to nothing.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Book is honeſt in this, whatever he is in other things, and owns his Drift is a Treaty not with <hi>England,</hi> but with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould have entred further into his Diſputes of the much better Treaty with <hi>France</hi> than <hi>England,</hi> if I had not been happily prevented by a Book, which appears juſt while I am writing this, entitled, <hi>The Advantages of</hi> Scotland <hi>by an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, &amp;c.</hi> In which he is ſo fairly confuted, and the Argument handled ſo clearly, that it would be an Injuſtice to the Gentleman that wrote it, tho I know not who he is, not to acknowledge that he has done his Country Juſtice, and the Argument too; and I believe will not be replyed to in haſte.</p>
            <p>After what has been there ſaid, I ſhall not ſo much as think my ſelf able to ſay any thing fit to be added; and ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways let the World ſee, that whether I know when to ſpeak or no, I always know when to hold my Tongue.</p>
            <p>But I cannot quit this Diſcourſe, without drawing one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from all theſe things. <hi>viz.</hi> That in all theſe Debates, and however different the Opinions of ſome People are from others in that matter of the Union,—<hi>I</hi> know not by what concurrence of Cauſes it happens, but this ſeems to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conceſſion of all the contending Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not in a condition to Subſiſt, or at leaſt to Flouriſh by Her ſelf.—That She ſeems under ſome neceſſity to Unite or Confederate ſome where.—And ſo the Debate, is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther She ſhall Unite with ſome body or no, but whether She ſhall Unite with this or that, with <hi>England, France, Holland,</hi> or who?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0386703300:16"/>
If I were a <hi>Scots</hi> Man, or if you could bear with Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth from a Stranger, that ſtrives to ſpeak impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Truth, and has not one Shilling to gain or loſe, let it go which way it will—I would ask ſome of theſe Gentlemen, Whether they have conſidered their National Circumſtances as to <hi>England,</hi> and examin'd not how they could break with <hi>England?</hi> For I am not a going to inſult <hi>Scotland</hi>—But in what Poſture, as to Trade, <hi>Scotland</hi> would be upon an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Prohibition between <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, there is a kind of Prohibition already as to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> You have prohibited almoſt all the Manufactures, and take nothing from them you can well be without—But they have not yet treated you ſo; they have not return'd you <hi>in kind.</hi> I would ask theſe Gentlemen, How they would look, and in what Condition, as to Trade and ready Money, <hi>Scotland</hi> would be, if there were equal Prohibitions and an univerſal Stop of Trade between the Nations, that neither your Cattle nor Linnen was admitted there; the Return of which is now wholly in Caſh.</p>
            <p>Some Gentlemen have ſaid, You can do without it, and perhaps you may: Come, Gentlemen, let us examine how.</p>
            <p>Why firſt theſe Gentlemen ſay, <hi>France</hi> will take off your Wool, Lead, Salmond and Herring—Well, Gentlemen, and what will they give you for it?—Wine, Brandy, Fruit, Silk, Toys and Trinkets. I won't engage here with the Gentlemen, and diſoblige the Men of the Bottle ſo far, as to make a Calculation of the wondrous Advantages of Wine and Brandy, and how much they contribute to the Wealth of the Nation; and therefore I leave that Debate, only this I muſt ſay, That your Import every Year exceeds your Export; and if this Trade is to encreaſe your Wealth and People, it will ſtill encreaſe your Conſumption; and you muſt pay <hi>France</hi> the Over-plus in ſpecie, and ſo promote the Manufacture of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0386703300:17"/>
Drunkenneſs at the Price of the Conſumption of your Bullion.</p>
            <p>But then as to Wool, 'tis own'd <hi>France</hi> will take little Wool, if any of your own Growth, at leaſt not without <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Wool with it—And if effectual Care is taken to prevent the Export of that Wool from <hi>England,</hi> I ſuppoſe you will find a Decay there—And if you oblige <hi>France</hi> to take your Fiſh, and cannot ſupply them with Wool, you muſt make them Amends ſome other way; as perhaps by filling their Armies with <hi>Scots</hi> Troops, and ſending your Gentlemen into their Service. So exporting your <hi>Scots</hi> Blood by their Gallantry and Courage, help <hi>France</hi> to pull down the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and enſlave <hi>Europe,</hi> of which Bondage you muſt at laſt come in for a ſhare.</p>
            <p>But next to this ſays another Gentleman, we may export our Linnen to <hi>Spain,</hi> and our Beef to the <hi>Canaries</hi> and <hi>Madera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, ſo you may, if you pleaſe, with an Union as well as now: So that whatever you gain of Export to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is all as clear as it was before; for you may make enough for both Trades, if you pleaſe, and conſequently employ more People in the Work, more Land in the Planting, and ſo the Trade to <hi>Spain</hi> is juſt as it was, and receives no manner of Alteration.</p>
            <p>For the ſending Beef to the <hi>Canaries,</hi> &amp;c. I ſuppoſe the Gentlemen that have been ſo forward in that Argument, have never been at, or have never Traded to thoſe Iſlands, otherwiſe they would not offer ſuch odd kind of Propoſals: And to ſhorten them, I diſcreetly would reviſe their Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and compare them with the following Circumſtances, and then I perſwade my ſelf they will have Honour enough to change their Sentiments.</p>
            <p>1ſt. <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1699 took from <hi>Scotland</hi> in Trade, and for which they paid ready Money,
<list>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0386703300:18"/>
                  <item>31608 Head of Black Cattel.</item>
                  <item>25470 Sheep.</item>
               </list>
Over and beſides the Number of both ſorts, which are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly convoyed over the Borders, and which is impoſſible, the Tract of Land being ſo great, can by any Vigilance of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers be prevented; which ſome ſay amounts to as many more, but all agree, are a very great Quantity.</p>
            <p>Now I would be glad to know, where the Gentlemen would export this Quantity of Cattel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Canaries</hi> and <hi>Madera,</hi> the Inhabitants are few, the Fleſh they eat little; and if they were to have all the Beef they buy from <hi>Scotland,</hi> they would not take off 5000 Bullocks or Beeves a year.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> from whence they are ſupplied with Pipe-ſtaves, which ly ſo much nearer to them; and from whom they are ſupplied with Beef and Pork, ſo cheap, that I wonder how theſe Gentlemen could think of thoſe Places to ſell thirty thouſand Black Cattel a year in.</p>
            <p>If they could ſell thoſe Cattel, where would they ſell the Returns? <hi>Madera</hi> Wine they could not diſpoſe of any where, and of <hi>Canary</hi> but a ſmall Quantity, without Help of <hi>England;</hi> and Silver is not to be had in thoſe Iſlands: Which way they would either make their Returns, or get Loading back for their Ships, is a Myſtery paſt any Man's Underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But were all theſe Difficulties over, had thoſe Iſlands no Fleſh from the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> had <hi>Scotland</hi> a vent at home for 20 Ships Load of <hi>Canary</hi> and <hi>Modera</hi> Wine to ſecure their Ships a back Freight.—Yet at laſt, I ſay, they could not Sell ten Barrels of Beef a year, in either <hi>Canaries</hi> or <hi>Madera,</hi>—And I think the Reaſon is plain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Beef is ſo much Better, ſo much Cheaper, and their Shipping and Sailing ſo much Eaſier, that they would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0386703300:19"/>
be able to out-ſell them there, reckoning Value and Price a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred <hi>per Cent:</hi>—Now to make this out, I ſhall not give the Reader the trouble of Calculations, only let him know, that the beſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Beef, Large and Fat, not to make Compariſon, has been to be had at <hi>Kinſale, Cork</hi> or <hi>Galloway,</hi> for under 6 <hi>ſh. per</hi> Hundred weight, for ſome years paſt, that is to ſay, for very little more than half penny <hi>Sterling per lib.</hi> and I leave the Calcule to any Body that pleaſe to make it.</p>
            <p>While this is ſo, I muſt take leave to ſay, neither <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> nay, nor <hi>New-England,</hi> or <hi>New York,</hi> can come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Trade.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Selling their Beef to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, and ſending it in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottoms, can carry the <hi>Madera</hi> Wines to the Iſlands, or bring the <hi>Canarie</hi> Wines to <hi>England</hi> in the ſame Ship; this the <hi>Scots</hi> can never come up to <hi>without an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and I appeal to all the World, for the Truth of Fact in this particular.</p>
            <p>Where the Gentlemen then will diſpoſe of 30000 to 50000 of Black Cattel to Ballance the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, I know not.</p>
            <p>I Recommend this Thought, to thoſe Gentlemen who are ſo very warm for Draw-backs upon Beef Exported for Sale; and I would be glad, they would tell us, to what place of the World the whole Iſland of <hi>Britain,</hi> ſends 10 Laſt of Beef in Seven Year for Sale; and if ſo, why they will Clog the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with ſuch Demands.—</p>
            <p>I come next to the Linnen, You have in the Publick account of the Exports of Linnen, to <hi>England</hi> and other parts, above 1800000 Ells of Linnen carried out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in one year.</p>
            <p>This may be all ſent to <hi>Spain, they ſay;</hi> ſuppoſe that were true, <hi>tho' as to quantity I queſtion it,</hi> yet ſince the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as every body knows, have ſent none of this to <hi>Spain,</hi> the War having Stopt that Trade; then if the <hi>Scots</hi> can ſend ſo much to <hi>Spain,</hi> they yet loſe the Sale of ſo much more in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

So that here is above 800000 Ells of Linnen, 31608 Black Cattle, and 25240 Sheep, left on your hands, by rejecting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade; and all the ready Money they bring with them now, kept out of the Kingdom, upon a breach with <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would be glad to ſee theſe Gentlemen, offer ſome of their Equivalents for this, for an Equivalent, <hi>as much as they banter that poor Word,</hi> muſt be had ſome where, or elſe it will be worſe.—Above all, I wait for their <hi>French</hi> Equivalent, and the account of the Return they would make from <hi>France,</hi> for their Fiſh, Lead and Wool.—I ſuppoſe, they will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſend Linnen to <hi>France.</hi>—</p>
            <p>While I am Writing this, I am preſented with a Book Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, <hi>A Letter concerning the Conſequences of an Incorporating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in relation to Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> confeſs it is a wonderful Book, &amp; partakes of the reſt of the Miracles of this Age, wherein Arguments are raiſed out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting Syſtems, to Prove and Diſprove what Men pleaſe. I muſt own, <hi>I</hi> think the Author of this Book, ſeems to be in a Plot for the Union, and that by laying down Arguments, that even the Gentlemen, who have Declared againſt the Union, have too much Senſe than to make uſe of, he would confound the Debate with Abſurdities and Contradictions, and argue People into it by ſhowing them a heap of Ridiculous Arguments againſt it.</p>
            <p>I can not ſatisfie my ſelf, to waſte either my own time or the Reader's, with entering into his manifold weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but I'll repeat a few of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He tells us, That all Trade is Exchanging one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity for another, for the Convenience of Life and the ſupplying Nations with what their Neighbours have, which they want.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this, he is merry on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, and thinks he banters thoſe who ſay 'tis Advantageous to <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince, ſays he, we ſhall only get one Commodity for another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0386703300:21"/>
Without running his length, I ſhall bring it to a ſhort head. His notion of Trade by Exchanges is Right enough, only that he forgot to ſay, That where any Nation has more want of Foreign Goods, than She has Goods of her own to purchaſe them with, She muſt make up the Value in Money.</p>
            <p>On this turns the whole State of the Queſtion, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was in the right to forget it, for it would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown all his Syſtem.</p>
            <p>Money is an Intrinſick, plac'd as a Medium in the Center of Trade, to ſupply the differences in Value, between the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Import of one Nation to and from another.</p>
            <p>This is what we call Ballance of Trade, a thing many People talk of, tho' few underſtand.</p>
            <p>That Nation only can be ſaid to Gain by another, who ſend more Value in its own Product to that other Nation, than is receiv'd from it, becauſe the Ballance muſt be made good in this Intrinſick, called <hi>Specie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence 'tis a certain Maxim in Trade, That what ever any Country can part with of its own Growth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, is ſo much clear Gain to the publick Stock of that Nation.</p>
            <p>Whatever any Nation wants of the Growth and Product of another Nation, is ſo much Dead Loſs to the Public Stock of that Nation.</p>
            <p>And the Conſequence is Natural, that which a Nation partswith, or wants moſt in thoſe Terms, Gains or Loſes juſt ſo much in the General Ballance of Trade.</p>
            <p>Theſe are things too plain to need Repetition, and had not this Gentleman forgot this, whether wilfully or no, I do not determine, he would have never ſaid at firſt, <hi>That</hi> Scotland <hi>does not want the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Money,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay every Nation wants to Export all the Product of their Country they can ſpare, and all the Product of their Peoples Labour they can ſpare;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0386703300:22"/>
and every Nation wants their Neighbours Money for their Product, becauſe every Nation wants <hi>in the Language of Trade</hi> to be Gainers.</p>
            <p>And therefore to Export the People, inſtead of the Labour of the People is by the way, letting out the Life-Blood of a Nation: but of that by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>It remains therefore for this Gentleman, to tell us on a fair Examination, not whether you want the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, or no, now, or after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; but whether you gain Money by it or no, let any one tell me, whether you Gain by it or no? I'll tell him whether you want it or no.—</p>
            <p>To find out this I ſhall come to his own worthy Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Pag.</hi> 6—</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'We ſhall Import into <hi>England</hi> (ſays he) all our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; as to the Word <hi>free of Duttes,</hi> I ll ſpeak to it by it ſelf.—<hi>But he goes on,</hi> We ſend Linnen Cloth into <hi>England:</hi> What ſhall we get in return? Why Woollen Cloth, or what elſe the Perſons that ſell the Linnen think they can get moſt by at Home.</q>—And from hence this worthy Gentleman concludes, <hi>Here can be no Gain to</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>Now I'll only ſtate the Caſe on a Suppoſition, which I think no Man can deny me.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe <hi>Scotland</hi> ſends Linnen Cloth to <hi>England,</hi> to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of 200000 <hi>per Annum,</hi> and the Perſons that ſell it there, can ſell but 100000 <hi>l.</hi> in the Woollen return.—What muſt the Merchant bring Home? And how muſt <hi>England</hi> pay for the Linnen?—Muſt it not be in Money, and Who is the Gainer?</p>
            <p>From hence I leave it to the Reader to Calculate, <hi>Scotland</hi> has ſent 1828415 Ells of Linnen to <hi>England</hi> 31608 Black Cattel, 25420 Sheep in one Year, Pray what returns have they fetcht for this Trade? not VVoollen Goods, I believe any Body will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0386703300:23"/>
grant. Who then has been the Gainer in that Year of Trade, <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objection that this is before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, is not to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for after the Union, your Export may be Double in Coal, Salt, Corn and Wool, your Linnen double, and the like.</p>
            <p>Then it will remain to ask, How is it poſſible <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould conſume a Quantity of Woollen Goods from <hi>England</hi> equal to this, you having both Wool and Manufactures of your own proportioned? 'tis impracticable, and where then all the reſt of your Export muſt be ſupplyed, is another of this Author's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naccountables.</p>
            <p>But ſays he, It is pretended <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt Export the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Goods again to the Plantations: This makes Good what I ſaid before, That he offers this to Banter the Oppoſers of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and bring them in talking ridiculouſly, on purpoſe to expoſe them.</p>
            <p>For no Body ever but himſelf, pretended that <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould Trade to the Colonies with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods; that were to make it a Trade and no Trade to them, turn them into meer Pedlars, or Second-hand Chap-men, and to put a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Colonies, to think they ſhould ſend to <hi>Scotland</hi> for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture, when at the ſame time, they Trade to <hi>England</hi> directly.</p>
            <p>And why pray cannot <hi>Scotland</hi> Trade to the Colonies with her own Product, and the Labour of her own People? Her Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens, her low priz'd Woollens are as vendible, and as much wanted there, as any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods what ever, and ſhe wants no quantity.</p>
            <p>Her Returns for theſe are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The imployment of her Shipping and Seamen. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Product of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which she now buys in <hi>England,</hi> and bringing which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0386703300:24"/>
from the Colonies, will encreaſe the Ballance between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtill higher.</p>
            <p>But ſays the Author, You cannot diſpoſe of the Sugars and Tobacco; and if you ſend them Abroad, you get nothing but Linnen from <hi>Holland,</hi> or Lace from <hi>Flanders,</hi> or Naval Stores from the Eaſt.—Very good. Do you want theſe things or no? If you do not, you wont Import them; if you do, you will Import them, and unleſs you can pay for them in Goods, you muſt in Money: So that ſtill the Advantage of Exporting your Tobacco and Sugar is equal to Exporting your own Product; becauſe it either returns you directly in Money, or ſaves you ſending your own Money abroad, which is letting the Nation blood in the Vitals.</p>
            <p>Thus, with Submiſſion to this Gentleman, bringing things back to firſt Principles, will unravel all this Clue of Knotty Argument, and if I Miſtake not, will diſcover the Nakedneſs of it more than ſufficiently to the World.</p>
            <p>The ſame Author, to Anſwer an Objection of the <hi>Scots</hi> Working Cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> has this further Deep Conſideration, That either the <hi>Engliſh</hi> muſt come down to our low Wages, or the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt come up to their high Wages; and therefore the <hi>Scots</hi> Manufactures cannot be Cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to make this out, I deſire, he would be pleaſed then to reconcile the following Heads to his Maxim, That <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall not get by the Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſays, The Workmen will certainly Live where they can get moſt for their Labour, <hi>That I grant him readily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be forced to be brought down to the low Wages in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it muſt be, that they ſee the <hi>Scots</hi> fall ſo heartily into their Manufactures, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſel and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0386703300:25"/>
and Underwork them, that if they do not ſink the Price too, they ſhall loſe their Trade. Or,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the <hi>Scots</hi> come up to the high Wages of <hi>England,</hi> the poor People will live here, as well as they do in <hi>England,</hi> and the Trade will be in Proportion Greater; and I will be Content to hear, which of theſe Conſequences will be a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, Gentlemen, more Wonders are arriv'd, and the Strangeneſs to me is very Great, I Confeſs, except that 'tis true that Miracles are not Ceaſed, and this is very Particular.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſays, and introduces it with an <hi>I AFFIRM</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> can be no Gainers by the Freedom of their Trade to the Plantations; Nay, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would give the <hi>Scots</hi> all their Plantations, they would be no Advantage to them.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> gain nothing by the Plantations themſelves, nor have they been ever any Gain to them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This wretched Stuff is follow'd by another, That bringing home Naval Stores, can be no Advantage to you; becauſe building or imploying Ships, will be no Advantage, only Diſpeopleing your Country.</p>
            <p>I need but name theſe things to the World, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly done to Banter the Caſe; the Man is certainly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Union, it cannot be otherwiſe:</p>
            <p>But mark the Foundation on which all this is Built, is, <hi>England</hi> gains by no Foreign Trade, only gains by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures.</p>
            <p>And how could we Gain by our Manufactures, if there was not a Foreign Trade to Vent them?</p>
            <p>But we Gain nothing, but what is returned in unperiſhable Commodities,—Allow that now,—Why then, we have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0386703300:26"/>
Gain'd all the ready Money in <hi>England,</hi> all the Plate, all the Bullion, all the Iron, Braſs, Steel, or Mettals imported.</p>
            <p>All the Moveable Stock of the Nation, is clear Gain to it, be it in Ships Buildings, Furniture, Stores, Wares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How have they Gain'd all this? it muſt be by Trade, and the Perſonal Eſtates in <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as Houſes, Ships, Goods, Cattel, Plate, Jewels, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are computed at much more than the Value of the Fee ſimple of all the Land at 100 Years Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>But I'll tyre you no more with this Miſerable Stuff, pray, Gentlemen, pardon me the Freedom I take with this Author, and do not think I imagine <hi>Scotland</hi> can be capable of ſuch Nonſence; I am very well aſſured, this is another <hi>Engliſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and that this Book came from <hi>England,</hi> it taſtes both of the Spirit, the Temper and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there, who ſet up to Inſtruct you here, in what you know better than they.</p>
            <p>But now, Gentlemen, to come Home to your own Trade with <hi>England,</hi> either as it is, or as it may be with or without an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</p>
            <p>If an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion go on, 'tis alledg'd you ſhall have higher Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms than you have now.—To this the Reſolution of your Committee is a full Reply, in which they tell you, how all the Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> which ſhall expire at 1710, being deducted, your Cuſtoms Rated on the preſent Export and Import of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be leſs than they are now, by 150000 <hi>l. Scots per Annum,</hi> beſides upwards of 220000 <hi>l. Scots</hi> taken off from your Manufactures when Exported to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I think, has in a manner ſilenc'd the Gentlemen, that throng'd the Town with their Calculs of Cuſtoms riſing upon you, as ſomething elſe has done about the Re-payment of the Equivalent.</p>
            <p>The Trade lying thus, let me ſtate it two ways.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0386703300:27"/>
'Tis evident by the Report of the Perſons employ'd by the Government to calculate this, that your Exports to <hi>England</hi> now without an Union, amount to 200000 lib. Sterling <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Man has yet ventur'd to ſay, That you make any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from thence that bear a Proportion to this,—all their Manufactures being prohibit. But becauſe I would give all reaſonable Allowance, I am content to ſuppoſe, that you receive from <hi>England</hi> in Goods 50000 li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>per Annum.</hi> I'll ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Noblemen and Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their Expenſes, and the Fine Things they buy there, ſpend 50000 lib. more, tho both theſe Sums exceedingly out-do the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the thing.</p>
            <p>But this being allowed, then 'tis yet true, that <hi>Scotland</hi> gets 100000 lib. <hi>per Annum</hi> in Money from <hi>England</hi> by Trade; how ſhe would make her ſelf Amends for that Loſs by a Trade to <hi>France,</hi> I can ſee no room to find out: And for a Trade to <hi>Spain,</hi> She has it with the Trade to <hi>England,</hi> and may enlarge it as ſhe thinks fit; and <hi>England</hi> will help, not hinder Her to enlarge it.</p>
            <p>If then you get 100000 lib. <hi>per Annum</hi> by <hi>England,</hi> 'tis a good Trade without an Union: Let's now examine if the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will make it greater or leſs; and upon this the whole State of the Caſe will turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are told here, that after the Union, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures will throng in upon <hi>Scotland</hi>—And tho' I think 'tis your own Fault, if you do not make all the ſame you do now, and both better and cheaper: yet for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſake, ſuppoſe you to buy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Goods; pray what Goods ſhall you ſend to <hi>England</hi> then, more than you do now?</p>
            <p>If then after the Union, you ſhall ſend more Goods to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> over and above the Quantity you now ſend, than you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0386703300:28"/>
ſhall receive from thence, over and above what you now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, you are ſtill more Gainers than you were before.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I am to ſuppoſe, that all the Import of Tobacco, Sugar, Ginger, Dye ſtuffs, &amp;c. which come from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> ſhall be taken off from the Debit of your Import from <hi>England,</hi> ſince either you will have them directly from thence, and in return for your own Manufactures and Money to boot, or you muſt be much weaker in your purſuing your own Advantages, than I take ye to he.</p>
            <p>If you imported 50000 lib. <hi>per Annum</hi> in Goods from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I believe, a full half of that Sum is made up by thoſe kinds of Goods, with which we are ſupplied from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To encreaſe this Trade to <hi>England,</hi> I come to ask a few Queſtions, which I would be glad to hear any Body anſwer.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How many Coals ſhall go away yearly from the Firth of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> when 7 <hi>ſh.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> Duty is taken off by the Union, and they as cheap here as at <hi>New-Caſtle;</hi> and 5 ſh. <hi>per</hi> Chalder always above them at <hi>London?</hi> I aſſure you, when I have ſaid, it ſhall amount to 100000 Chalder, I have been blam'd, as not gueſſing above half the Quantity.</item>
               <item>2. How many Weigh of Salt, of which ſome ſay 20000 Wey? I am content to ſay half that Quantity, and I dare ſay, it ſhall not fall ſhort of that.</item>
               <item>3. VVhat Quantity of Corn ſhall go to <hi>England</hi> yearly, eſpecially that we call <hi>Horſe-Corn,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Oats, Beans</hi> and <hi>Peaſe,</hi> which always yield a good Price at <hi>London,</hi> and much more than in <hi>Scotland?</hi> If this Article does not amount to 100000 <hi>l: per Annum</hi> more, <hi>then I have no gueſs at what</hi> Scotland <hi>can part with of thoſe Sorts;</hi> for I am free to ſay, If they will ſend them to <hi>England,</hi> they will always buy them there, and at a good Price.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0386703300:29"/>
4. <hi>The Wool,</hi> and now we come to a great <hi>Queſtion,</hi> What Amends will be made to <hi>Scotland</hi> for the loſs of the Wool Trade, and the difference of Price, between the Wool after the Prohibition, and what it is now, when we Export it Abroad?</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>To this I Anſwer,</hi> Sinking the Price indeed is the Immediate Conſequence, but the preſent Exporting it has ſeveral attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumſtances, which I conceive are not ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, by thoſe who are ſo angry at this head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The preſent Price of Wool, for which the <hi>Sheep-Maſters</hi> claim a Satisfaction, is not an Original; the firſt Exporting the Wool <hi>Raiſed it,</hi> and ſtopping that Export, is only Checking the Exorbitant Gain they make now, at the Price of their Country's Ruin, and bringing them back <hi>where they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a Trade Deſtructive to Induſtry, Ruinous to Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and tends to Robbing the Poor of their Imployment; as is evident in your Exporting it to the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and the North; where, if they had not <hi>your Wool,</hi> they muſt Buy <hi>your courſe Manufactures,</hi> and certainly Buy the leſs of the one, by how much the more they get of the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you will not work your Wool at home, tho' that is certainly your Advantage, eſpecially, when you may then have <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool freely to mix with it.—Still you may ſend it all to <hi>England,</hi> who <hi>opens their Doors</hi> to all the Wool, the whole World thinks fit to ſend them.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, they will not give the Price you get for it Abroad? <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> They will give, what you had better take than the Foreign Price, and what you ſhall get as much by.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I have 100 Packs of Wool at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 50 Packs I'll ſend to <hi>France,</hi> or to <hi>Sweden, or where you like,</hi> and for that I'll get 10 <hi>ſ: per</hi> Stone; 50 I ſend to <hi>England,</hi> and for that I get
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0386703300:30"/>
but 5 <hi>ſ: per</hi> Stone; yet I ſay, I had better ſend to <hi>England</hi> than Abroad. <hi>For Example,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I run the Riſque of the Sea <hi>On-ward</hi> bound, next the Riſque of Factors and Buyers <hi>Abroad.</hi> 2. I pay Freight and Commiſſion Abroad. 3. The Riſque <hi>is Repeated</hi> back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the Sea.—And <hi>laſtly,</hi> All this, at leaſt, Imploys the Stock ſix Months in time.</p>
            <p>If I think fit to Trade to <hi>England</hi> for Wool, I can always Sell it, and always Sell it for Ready Money, and may if I pleaſe, make 12 Returns of my Money, in that 6 Months time which I take in one Voyage the other way; and in doing this, I run no Riſque at all, and have my Money in my hand every time.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, The price to the Wool-Maſter is low. I <hi>Anſwer, England</hi> will give as much for yours, as for their own in proportion to its Goodneſs.—If yours is not ſo good as ſome of theirs, it is better than others, and ſtill you have Neighbours Fair and Right Dealing.</p>
            <p>I could run out here, and not Unprofitably perhaps tell you, That the Badneſs of your Wool in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not owing either to the <hi>Climate,</hi> the <hi>Soil,</hi> the Nature of the <hi>Graſs,</hi> or any of thoſe Circumſtances the Flegmatick Fancies of ſome People Suggeſt, <hi>which ſome,</hi> tho' they care not to hear other Folks Mention, are forward enough to mention themſelves.</p>
            <p>I could take the liberty to tell theſe Gentlemen, <hi>and perhaps make it out too,</hi> That the Courſeneſs of the Wool here, is owing to the ill Husbandry of the People, not the Inclemencies of Nature; and that they are too forward to Injure their own Country, and load her with the Effects of their own Inexcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Negligence; and this both in the Miſs-uſing the Sheep that breed this Wool, and ſpoiling the Wool with Tar, Greaſe, and horrible fooliſh Applications to it, when it is on the Sheeps back.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0386703300:31"/>
Indeed I avoid entring on this Matter here, becauſe I am preparing an Eſſay upon the Improvement of <hi>Scotland</hi> by it ſelf, which I deſign for the Publick Service in this very caſe; but this I undertake to ſay <hi>before hand,</hi> with reſpect to the Wool, That whether by better Management, your VVool might be made as Good as <hi>Engliſh, I do not affirm,</hi> tho' I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.—But certainly by your Management there, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> VVool might be brought to be every whit as bad as yours.</p>
            <p>Negligence and ill Husbandry, will Spoil the beſt Country in the VVorld, and the beſt Product in the VVorld; and <hi>tho' I am not for finding Fault,</hi> yet I muſt own the Conduct of the Gentlemen in <hi>Scotland</hi> with their Sheep, and <hi>not a little with their Land too,</hi> is one of the moſt Unaccountable things in the VVorld.—And if I have the Honour to Dictate ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Rectification in theſe caſes, to their Advantage, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they make the Experiment or no, I hope no Man will be angry with me, or count me an Enemy to <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ſhowing the way to its Improvement.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I proceed</hi> to the Trade of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and I cannot but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little here into a ſhort Trifle of Trade, call'd The Trade to <hi>America</hi> or the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and 'tis very Remarkable and well worth Obſervation; what pains has been taken to render this as the moſt Contemptible thing in the VVorld, a thing not worth <hi>England</hi>'s granting or <hi>Scotland</hi>'s accepting, much leſs a thing that <hi>England</hi> ought to Value her ſelf upon, or ſo much as ſuggeſt that <hi>Scotland</hi> is beholding to her for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One Author has the face to ſay, England</hi> never got any thing by the Trade of the Colonies her ſelf, and if ſhe would give them to <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was not a Gift <hi>worth Receiving,</hi> nor could <hi>Scotland</hi> be ever the better for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I confeſs theſe are ſtrange things,</hi> and 'tis hard to have to do with ſome kind of Gentlemen in Trade, who give themſelves
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0386703300:32"/>
a liberty to ſay what they pleaſe, without being Encumbred with, or any way Subjecting themſelves <hi>to the Bondage</hi> of ſpeaking Truth.</p>
            <p>And yet this Monſtruous Story, as I am told, comes from <hi>England,</hi> from whence I only draw one Inference, <hi>(viz.) That this Ignorance is not for want of an Opportunity of knowing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>—But there are ſome Gentlemen there, who have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long carefully furniſht the Town here, with ſomething which no Man durſt ſay, but ſuch as are <hi>out of Sight</hi> as to Bluſhing, and <hi>out of Hearing</hi> as to Reproach.</p>
            <p>The ſhort <hi>Scale of the Trade</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> conſiſts in theſe Heads, which when they are right ſtated, I ſhall think 'tis eaſy for any body to Determine whether that Trade is to be carried on to the Advantage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yea or no?</p>

            <p>Here is Publiſhed, <hi>A Letter from ſome Merchants of the</hi> Scots <hi>Nation Reſiding at</hi> London, where this Trade is Eſtimated to 400000 <hi>per Annum,</hi> Profit to the Traders of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the <hi>Guinea</hi> Trade to 50000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> I confeſs in the length of the particulars they <hi>Out-do me,</hi> and it muſt be ſome time before <hi>Scotland</hi> can carry it on to that hight.—Indeed, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Compting the Advantages of theſe things, becauſe I do not affect talking of Millions and great Sums.—But look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe things, Gentlemen, <hi>you that are to be convinc't by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,</hi> take them to pieces your ſelves, ſee if you can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void <hi>Confeſſing the Advantages;</hi> ſee if ſuch a Trade can be driven without a prodigious Gain, without incredible Fluxes of Wealth to the Nation <hi>in General,</hi> as well as to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants <hi>in particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſay, you have no Manufactures fit for the Colonies, or that you muſt <hi>Buy them from</hi> England, is to ſay, you have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, no Wool, no Flax.—Or to ſay, you <hi>will not</hi> make uſe of them; and certainly if you will not ſtir, you ſhall always be poor. He that will not Eat, <hi>muſt be Starv'd,</hi> there is no Remedy.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould the Gentlemen, that <hi>talk you up ſo high</hi> on one hand, and threaten the great Things you can do another way, <hi>talk you down ſo low in this,</hi> as if you were a Nation that had netheir Hands to Work, Heads to Direct, or Underſtandings to cloſe with Advantages of Commerce and Improvement, when they were put into your Hands.</p>
            <p>I allow <hi>Scotland</hi> is, <hi>and has been,</hi> under Diſcouragement both as to Foreign Trade and Manufactures. <hi>I allow</hi> your Poor are very low, and your Rich Men backward to Launch out.—And any Man, that takes me in the general ſcope, will eaſily ſee, this was the Intent and Meaning of my Arguing in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when I wrote <hi>the ſecond</hi> of theſe Eſſays, and Argued, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0386703300:34"/>
you ſhould be Exempted for ſome years from the Taxes on <hi>Malt</hi> and <hi>Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I cannot but think, that Noble Lord, <hi>asking his Lord ſhip</hi>'s <hi>Pardon for this Freedom,</hi> who quoted my Arguments on this head in Parliament, will do me that Juſtice, that they were all concluded in this very thing; and had his Lordſhip thought fit to have quoted but one Paragraph further, it would have appear'd, <hi>Eſſay</hi> II. <hi>P.</hi> 29. That <hi>Scotland</hi> being very low, <hi>and the Poor Unable to</hi> pay Taxes at all, ſhould <hi>be Exempted from the Taxes of Malt and Salt, for a certain term of years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, If I firſt concluded the Poor unable to bear the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Salt and Malt Tax at all, why ſhould I argue for Limited Exemption?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But on this Suppoſition,</hi> That by the Increaſe of Trade, Shipping, Manufactures and Labour, the Increaſe of Wages, and bettering the way of the Poor's Living, would be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and then the Taxes would not be equally Burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as now.</p>
            <p>In this, if I may be allowed to plead any Merit with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who am a Stranger, was then in <hi>England,</hi> and yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved earneſtly for Eaſe and Exemption for the Poor of this Kingdom, till they ſhould be enabled to pay Taxes, I think I acted a part no Man here ought to blame me for; and 'tis a little hard to draw an Argument from thence, that therefore <hi>they muſt never be charged at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without doubt, if Trade in <hi>Scotland</hi> encreaſes, Labour will encreaſe; if Labour encreaſes, Wages will encreaſe; for a Demand of Work makes a Demand of Wages of Courſe.</p>
            <p>So that I think, there remains only to prove, that there will be an Encreaſe of Trade: I think I have perform'd that in part; I ſhall be glad to ſee ſome other more able Hand perfect my Generals into Particulars by Schemes of Profit and Advantage <hi>on the Returns</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the Advantages of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0386703300:35"/>
building Ships, and conſequently a great <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Baltick</hi> Trade for Fiſh out, and Naval Stores home; again, on the Number of Families employ'd at home in Building, Fitting and Furniſhing Ships; and laſtly, the Nurſery of Sea men, and employing them in your own Ships, with the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch a Trade.</p>
            <p>Were due and juſt Schemes of theſe things laid down, I cannot but believe the mouths of thoſe People would for ever be ſtopt, who leſſen and miſrepreſent the Advantages of Trade which <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall obtain.</p>
            <p>It is enough however to my purpoſe, having not room here for Particulars to have laid down this general Scheme of a profitable Trade—</p>
            <p>That Trade only can be profitable, which employing their own People, carries out their own Growth or Product, and does not conſume all the Returns, but draws in the Surplus to it ſelf in Bullion, and this you do here exactly. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this,</p>
            <p>I would be glad any Man would ſtate me the following Voyage, ſuppoſe a thouſand Pound <hi>Sterling</hi> in <hi>Scots</hi> Linnen, and in Woollen Goods ſent to <hi>New-England, New York,</hi> or <hi>Virginia,</hi> in a <hi>Scots</hi> Ship, and is there veſted in Sugars, Mellaſſes or Tobacco, at the uſual Rate of Advance in thoſe Places, which is too <hi>per Cent,</hi> ſometimes much more.</p>
            <p>If theſe Returns come ſafe home to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and being not conſumed here, are again exported to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in a <hi>Scots</hi> Veſſel alſo, and at laſt the Effects produce 1250 lib. <hi>Sterling</hi> clear of all Charges, which is no unuſual nor extraordinary thing.</p>
            <p>What Profit does <hi>Scotland</hi> gain by this Voyage? I ſay, <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe we are to examine the Encreaſe to the Publick Stock, as well as to the private Merchant, in the Diſcourſe we are now upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0386703300:36"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Scotland <hi>gains</hi> all the Profit of the Labour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Manufactures that were exported, for all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges any Perſon earns in <hi>Scotland</hi> by his Labour, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what his Subſiſtance coſt him during his Labour, <hi>is clear gain to the general Stock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Scotland <hi>gains</hi> all the Profit of the Labour of every Perſon employ'd on Board the Ship for that Voyage, and of the Labour of all the Artificers, Labourers, &amp;c. employ'd in furniſhing that Ship for that Voyage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All the Proviſions expended in the Voyage, and all the Stores carried out, and not brought home, are clear Gain to the Stock of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Scotland <hi>gains</hi> all the Particulars of the ſame kinds again, on the Ship that carries the Goods away to <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Scotland <hi>gains</hi> the Profit on the foot of the Voyage to the Merchant and Owners.</p>
            <p>So that, if the Merchant here clears but 250 lib. by his Voyage, the National Publick Advantage may be 1500 lib. more, in the Freights and Furniture of the Ship and Cargo.</p>
            <p>From hence <hi>'tis alſo worth note,</hi> That if 20 ſuch Ships a Year went out from <hi>Scotland,</hi> it might very well be poſſible, that the Merchant ſhould not get a Farthing, nay might loſe by the Voyage, and yet the Publick National Stock be Gainer at leaſt 25000 lib. <hi>Sterl. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Man will <hi>after this</hi> tell me, That <hi>Scotland</hi> shall get nothing by the Plantation Trade,—I muſt own he is no Man for me to talk with, I muſt leave him to his own Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this Eſſay with only one Note about the Popular Objection, <hi>That after the Union</hi> all your Places, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments and Offices in the Cuſtoms, Exciſes, Taxes, Army
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0386703300:37"/>
and Navy, will be at the Diſpoſal of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> will be put upon you in all thoſe Caſes.</p>
            <p>It is not for me to determine, who shall or shall not be put into Places of Truſt <hi>in this Nation;</hi> I make no queſtion the Government will regard the Recommendation of the Council and of Honeſt Men here, as it does now in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would have theſe Gentlemen conſider two or three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Why should the Government be more partial to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as to Places here, <hi>than at home in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> where a <hi>Scots-man,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſeparate Poſture of the Nations, is as capable of Preferment as an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> and promiſcouſly preferr'd on all Occaſions?</item>
               <item>2. Would theſe Gentlemen be content to retain that Mark of Diſtinction between the Nations, that <hi>Scots-men</hi> only should be preferr'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> in <hi>England?</hi> And would not <hi>Scotland</hi> be vaſtly a Loſer by it, while many of Her Nation are now in Places of the greateſt Honour and Truſt in <hi>England?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Is it any Mark of <hi>England</hi>'s Partiality to <hi>Scotland,</hi> much leſs of any Diſtruſt of the Nation, That the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three ſtrong Places in <hi>England,</hi> the Keys of Her Wealth, of Her Trade, and of Her Navy, have for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 17 years paſt been committed to three Natives of <hi>Scotland,</hi> viz. <hi>Tilbury</hi> Fort, the Guard of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Thames</hi> and City of <hi>London,</hi> to Colonel <hi>Saint Clare; Sheerneſs</hi> Fort, the Key of <hi>Chatam</hi> River and Guard of the Royal Navy, to Colonel <hi>Crawford;</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> the greateſt Fortification and Magazin on the South of <hi>Britain,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Gibſon.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Beſides, innumerable Gentlemen of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, now in Truſt in the Service, Admiral <hi>Mitchel, Wiſhart,</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0386703300:38"/>
               <hi>Ker</hi> in the Navy, with 6 or 7 Captains in the Fleet, beſides Lieutenant General <hi>Steuart, Murray</hi> and <hi>Collier</hi> the Lord <hi>Portmore,</hi> his Grace the Duke of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I willingly omit in the Army.</p>
            <p>Theſe truſts, Gentlemen, do not favour of Partiality, and are as good Arguments to Ward againſt the Suggeſtion, as I think need to be made uſe of. On the other hand, there is no Queſtion but the Merit of the <hi>Scots</hi> Gentlemen will alwiſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them valuable and uſeful to <hi>Britain;</hi> and as they have alwiſe had their ſhare of Advancement in all Publick Buſineſs, ſo there is no Queſtion they will be more likely to obtain it now.</p>
            <p>I foreſee the Debate in the Parliament will have run its length, before the Printer will be pleaſed to let theſe Sheets come into the World, which makes me lay by what I had prepar'd to ſay about the keeping up, or diſſolving the <hi>Scots Caledonia</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>I Confeſs, 'tis my Opinion, as I have ſaid already, that your Company, as it was at firſt Eſtabliſh'd, could never have been of any Uſe to <hi>Scotland,</hi> unleſs by Force you had been able to have reduc'd <hi>Spain</hi> to a Neceſſity of eſtabliſhing a Trade with your Colony in <hi>America,</hi> and all the Proſpect of a Trade to <hi>India</hi> by the South-Seas, or any other way, without the Help of <hi>England,</hi> could never have Anſwer'd for want of a Mercat for Goods, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> being otherwiſe ſupplyed.</p>
            <p>But I wave entering on thoſe things here, the preſent Enquiry is, Why muſt we loſe our Company? Why muſt we give up all the Privileges of the Company?</p>
            <p>If I may be allow'd, without Offence, to ſpeak a little plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here, perhaps it may touch the Point nearly enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Who is this WE, for it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0386703300:39"/>
who ſpeaks; if it be We the Company, or We the Nation.</p>
            <p>If you mean We the Company, the Reaſon is Direct, you ought to part with your Company and be thankful, and take your Money, and ſay you have made a good Voyage, ſince you recover what you had loſt.—You get Principal and Intereſt, in a Caſe where I know ſeveral of the Members would have been content to have loſt all they had paid in, to have been ſecur'd againſt paying in any more.</p>
            <p>Of all People in the World theſe are the moſt Unacount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, who have Stocks there, and can give very little Account what other things they could ever expect, but the loſs of theſe Stocks, and yet are not for parting with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>All ſuch People can ſay, is, That if an Union was to come on, and the Company to ſtand, they might fill it with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subſcriptions, and make it a Rival Company in the Trade with the <hi>Engliſh</hi>—And what would <hi>Scotland</hi> Gain by that? the Trade would be entirely in <hi>England,</hi> the whole Returns there, and all the Conſequence would be the pleaſure of ruining both Companies, as would have been the certain Caſe with the two Companies in <hi>England,</hi> if the plain proſpect of it had not made them both Wiſe enough to Unite.</p>
            <p>But 2<hi>dly.</hi> Let us come to the other Caſe, We the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> why ſhould We part with the Company?</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Gentlemen, any wiſe People will part with what would be their Deſtruction to keep.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You cannot Unite with <hi>England,</hi> without part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it, two Companies being Intolerable in <hi>Britain.</hi>

            <p>As to the firſt,—an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company abſtracted from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0386703300:40"/>
your Trade to <hi>England,</hi> would be the Deſtruction of all your Commerce, for two Reaſons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. You could export nothing but your ready Money.</item>
               <item>2. You would import what you could neither ſell in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor carry Abroad to any Advantage.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe needs no Explication, 'tis the Complaint in <hi>England,</hi> and a Complaint not very eaſily anſwer'd, and from whence ſome pretend to ſay, The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is a Grievance to <hi>England, tho I do not ſay I am of that Mind nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> But I am certain of this, that <hi>Scotland</hi> could not bear the Export of their Bullion, at leaſt not now.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Second,</hi> 'tis evident the Import could not be vended here: And as for Foreign Markets, the <hi>Dutch</hi> are the great Staple—and what can be imagin'd you can get by them? Some Particulars indeed might be ſold in <hi>Spain,</hi> and a little at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> but far ſhort of enough to ſupport the Trade. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> uphold their Trade by the Strength of their Home Conſumpt, which is a vaſt Gulph of Trade; and the Export again is but upon Circumſtances and Trifles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the Groſs; and <hi>Scotland</hi> having no Home Conſumpt, an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade would be ruinous to them; a <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade would involve them in a War, and a War, which I think, without reflecting at all upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> She is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to carry on, having no Naval Force to cope with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus either way She is in no National Capacity to carry on the Trade, or to keep up the Company; why then ſhould She not part with it, when good Conditions are to be had for the Exchange, and all her Merchants are at liberty to Trade in the general Stock in <hi>England,</hi> as much as any Merchant there?</p>
            <p n="2">2. You cannot Unite with <hi>England</hi> without parting with this Company.</p>

The Reaſon for this is very plain; Two Companies in <hi>England</hi> had not only almoſt deſtroyed one another, but they bid fair for ruining the whole Nation, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding all the Parties to one ſide or other; and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all Publick Affairs to their Favour, they became the very Center of all the National Diviſions, and all the Factions ſeem'd to be Incorporated into the two Companies.</p>
            <p>Thus the Nation began to be Stock jobb'd into Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and Sale; and the Power of two ſuch Rivals made even the King himſelf concern himſelf to bring them to Conditions: and the whole Nation was made uneaſy by the Agreement, which by this time, had the Breach continued, might have embroil'd us all. This is a Reaſon ſufficient why <hi>England</hi> cannot Unite, while two <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Companies ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Well, ſay ſome Gentlemen, with all our Hearts we dont deſire they ſhould let them let it alone.</p>
            <p>Why? truly there I believe much of the Caſe lyes; they that Argue for the having the <hi>African</hi> Company kept up, do it chiefly, that if poſſible, it might be a Cheque to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; and ſo 'tis the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, not the Company they are Debating.</p>
            <p>As to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Gentlemen, I avoid mentioning it as much as I can, becauſe ſome People are ſo Chary, they will not bear to have it mentioned, and I am loth to give any Body Offence.</p>
            <p>But in this Caſe it cannot be helpt, <hi>England</hi> cannot <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite with an open Trade to <hi>India;</hi> She cannot come into the ſame Confuſion as she was in, under two Companies before, it is Inconſiſtent with her Peace, and with her Trade, and in the End would be ſo to yours too.</p>
            <p>As to them that would not have her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite, and therefore Argues about keeping the Company, I have nothing to ſay
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0386703300:42"/>
to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting, but never let them bring this as a Difficulty; for let it go what way it will, the Company can never be of any Benefit to <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor shall it be ever true, that by the Union <hi>Scotland</hi> shall not be vaſtly Gainer.</p>
            <p>Well, but ſays another Gentleman, What if all this be true? muſt we needs Unite with you, if we do get 300000 <hi>per Annum,</hi> and all the things you talk of?—<hi>We han't a mind to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite:</hi> And what then? Why ſhould we be forc'd to it?</p>
            <p>No, by no means, ſay I, I abhor Force; I am laying out the Advantages to Perſwade; if Force was to be uſed, there could be no need of Perſwading.—God forbid I ſhould think, much leſs talk of <hi>Englands</hi> Forcing <hi>Scotland</hi> to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite.—And I have ſaid my mind on that Head to your Advantage long before I thought of coming to theſe Parts.—Nor ſhould I expect any Good from ſuch a Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>But it is a Compulſion of Reaſoning, <hi>Argument Conſtrains;</hi> and ſuch a Force there will be indeed; and you will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this Struggle, whether you <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite or no, come to ſtoop your Reaſon to the Force of the Thing, and hereafter, not too late, I hope, own your ſelves Miſtaken.</p>
            <p>If you wont <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite, Gentlemen, I cannot help that: but in the mean time do not pretend to Reaſon it out of your ſight, for all manner of Argument is againſt you; And you can reject an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion upon no Foot, but that of Acting againſt your own Light, and the Invincible Power of your own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
