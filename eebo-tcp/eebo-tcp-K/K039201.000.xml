            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I was firſt call'd to the Office of Hiſtoriographer to <hi>John Bull,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd himſelf to this purpoſe: <hi>Sir</hi> Humphry, <hi>I know you are a plain Dealer; it is for that Reaſon I have choſen you for this important Truſt; ſpeak the Truth, and ſpare not.</hi> That I might fulfil thoſe his honourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, I obtain'd Leave to <hi>repair</hi> to, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him in his most ſecret Retirements; and I put the Journals of all Tranſactions into a ſtrong Box, to be open'd at a fitting Occaſion, after the manner of the Hiſtoriographers of ſome Eaſtern Monarchs: This I thought was the ſafest way; tho' I declare I was never afraid to be <hi>chop'd</hi> by my Maſter for telling of Truth. It is from thoſe Journals that my Memoirs are compil'd: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not Poſterity, a thouſand Years hence, look for Truth in the voluminous Annals of Pedants, who are entirely ignorant of the ſecret Springs of great Actions; if they do, let me tell them, they will be <hi>Nebus'd.</hi> With incredible Pains have I endeavour'd to copy the ſeveral Beauties of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="tcp:0488800900:3"/>
and modern Hiſtorians; the impartial Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the Gravity, Auſterity, and ſtrict Morals of <hi>Thucidides,</hi> the extenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> the Sublimity and Grandeur of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and to avoid the careleſs Stile of <hi>Polybius:</hi> I have borrow'd conſiderable Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus:</hi> The <hi>ſpecious Gilding</hi> of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> I endeavour'd to ſhun. <hi>Mariana, Davila,</hi> and <hi>Fra. Paulo,</hi> are thoſe amongst the Moderns whom I thought most worthy of Imitation; but I cannot be ſo diſingenuous, as not to own the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Obligations I have to the <hi>Pilgrim's Progreſs</hi> of <hi>John Bunyan,</hi> and the <hi>Tenter Belly</hi> of the Reverend <hi>Joſeph Hall.</hi> From ſuch Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Helps, it is eaſy to gueſs to what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection I might have brought this great Work, had it not been nip'd in the Bud by ſome illiterate People in both Houſes of Parliament, who envying the great Figure I was to make in future Ages, under Pretence of raiſing Money for the War, have padlock'd all thoſe very Pens that were to celebrato the Actions of their Heroes, by ſilencing at once the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet.</hi> I am perſwaded, that nothing but the Proſpect of an approaching Peace could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd them to make ſo bold a ſtep. But ſuffer me, in the Name of the rest of the Matriculates of that famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, to ask them ſome plain Queſtions: Do they think that Peace will bring along with it the Golden Age? Will there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Dying-Speech of a Traitor? Are <hi>Cethegus</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>WHere, I think, I left <hi>John Bull,</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between <hi>Nic. Frog</hi> and <hi>Lewis Baboon,</hi> with his Arms <hi>a-kimbo,</hi> in great Concern to keep <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Nic.</hi> aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As watchful as he was, <hi>Nic.</hi> found the Means, now and then, to ſtear a Whiſper, and, by a cleanly Conveyance under the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſlip a ſhort Note into <hi>Lewis</hi>'s hand,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0488800900:9"/>
which <hi>Lewis</hi> as ſlyly put into <hi>John</hi>'s Pocket, with a Pinch or a Jog, to warn him what he was about. <hi>John</hi> had the Curioſity to retire into a Corner, to peruſe theſe <hi>Billet deux</hi> of <hi>Nic</hi>'s; wherein he found, that <hi>Nic,</hi> had uſed great Freedoms, both with his Intereſt and Reputation. One contained theſe words, <hi>Dear</hi> Lewis, <hi>Thou ſeest clearly that this Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head can never bring his Matters to bear: Let thee and me talk to night by our ſelves at the</hi> Roſe, <hi>and I'll give thee Satisfaction.</hi> Another was thus expreſs'd; <hi>Friend</hi> Lewis, <hi>Has thy Senſe quite forſaken thee, to make</hi> Bull <hi>ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers? Hold fast, part with nothing, and I will give thee a better Bargain, I'll warrant thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome of his Billets, he told <hi>Lewis</hi> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that <hi>John Bull</hi> was under his Guardianſhip; that the beſt part of his Servants were at his Command; that he could have <hi>John</hi> gagg'd and bound whenever he pleaſed, by the People of his own Family."</q> In all theſe Epiſtles, Blockhead, Dunce, Aſs, Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, were the beſt Epithets he gave poor <hi>John:</hi> In others he threatned, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that He, Eſquire <hi>South,</hi> and the reſt of the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, would lay <hi>Lewis</hi> down upon his Back, beat out his Teeth, if he did not retire immediately, and break up the Meeting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I fancy I need not tell my Reader, that <hi>John</hi> often chang'd Colour as he read, and that his Fingers itch'd to give <hi>Nic.</hi> a good Slap on the Chops, but he wiſely moderated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0488800900:10"/>
his cholerick Temper: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I ſav'd this Fellow (quoth he) from the Gallows when he ran away from his laſt Maſter, becauſe I thought he was harſhly treated; but the Rogue was no fooner ſafe under my Protection, than he began to lie, pilfer, and ſteal, like the Devil: When I firſt ſet him up in a warm Houſe, he had hardly put up his Sign, when he began to debauch my beſt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers from me: Then it was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice to rob my Fiſh-ponds, not only to feed his Family, but to trade with the Fiſhmongers: I conniv'd at the Fellow till he began to tell me, that they were his as much as mine: In my Manour of <hi>Eaſtcheap,</hi> becauſe it lay at ſome diſtance from my conſtant Inſpection, he broke down my Fences, robb'd my Orchards, and beat my Servants. When I us'd to repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him for his Tricks, he would talk ſaucily, lye, and brazen it out, as if he had done nothing amiſs. Will nothing cure thee of thy Pranks <hi>Nic.</hi> (quoth I?) I ſhall be forced, ſome time or another, to chaſtiſe thee: The Rogue got up his Cane and threatned me, and was well thwack'd for his Pains: But I think his Behaviour at this time worſt of all; after I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt drowned my ſelf, to keep his Head above Water, he would leave me ſticking in the Mud, truſting to his Goodneſs to help me out. After I have beggar'd my

ſelf with his troubleſome Law-Suit, with a Pox to him, he takes it in mighty Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon becauſe I have brought him here to end Matters amicably, and becauſe I won't let him make me over, by Deed and Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as his lawful Cully; which, to my certain Knowledge, he has attempted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times.

               <hi>John Bull</hi> begg'd him to lay aſide that immoderate Concern for him; and withal, put him in mind, that the Intereſt of thoſe Tradeſmen had not ſat quite ſo heavy upon him ſome Years ago, on a like Occaſion. <hi>Nic.</hi> anſwer'd little to that, but immediately pull'd out a Boatſwain's Whiſtle; upon the firſt Whiff, the Tradeſmen came jumping into the Room, and began to ſurround <hi>Lewis</hi> like ſo many yelping Curs about a great Boar, or, to uſe a modeſter Simile, like Duns at a great Lord's Leve the Morning he goes into the Country; one pull'd him by the Sleeve, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Skirt, a third hallow'd in his Ear; they began to ask him for all that had been taken from their Forefathers by Stealth, Fraud, Force, or lawful Purchaſe; ſome ask'd for Manours, others for Acres, that lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them; that he would pull down his Fences, level his Ditches; all agreed in one common Demand, that he ſhould be

purg'd, ſweated, vomited, and ſtarv'd, till be came to a ſizeable Bulk, like that of his Neighbours; one modeſtly ask'd him Leave to call him Brother; <hi>Nic. Frog</hi> demanded two Things, to be his Porter and his Fiſhmonger, to keep the Keys of his Gates, and furniſh his Kitchen; <hi>John</hi>'s Siſter <hi>Peg</hi> only deſir'd that he would let his Servants ſing Pſalms a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; ſome deſcended even to the asking of old Cloaths, Shoes, and Boots, broken Bottles, Tobacco-pipes, and Ends of Candles.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Bull</hi> (quoth <hi>Lewis</hi>) you ſeem to be a Man of ſome Breeding; for God's ſake uſe your Intereſt with theſe Meſſicurs, that they wou'd ſpeak but one at once; for if one had a hundred pair of Hands, and as many Tongues, he cannot ſatisfy them all at this rate. <hi>John</hi> begg'd they might proceed with ſome Method; then they ſtop'd all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and would not ſay a word. If this be your Play (quoth <hi>John</hi>) that we may not be like a Quaker's dumb Meeting, let us begin ſome Diverſion; what d'ye think of Rouly-Pouly, or a Country-Dance? What if we ſhould have a Match at Football! I am ſure we ſhall never end Matters at this rate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Nic. Frog.</speaker>
               <p>With all my Heart, I love exact Dealing; and let <hi>Hocus</hi> Audit; he knows how the Money was disburs'd.</p>

               <speaker>J. Bull.</speaker>
               <p>I am not much for that at preſent; we'll ſettle it between Ourſelves: Fair and Square <hi>Nic.</hi> keeps Friends together. There have been laid out in this Law-Suit, at one time 36000 Pounds and 40000 Crowns: In ſome Caſes I, in others you, bear the greatest proportion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nic.</speaker>
               <p>Right: I pay three Fifths of the greateſt Number, and you pay two Thirds of the leſſer Number: I think this is Fair and Square as you call it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John.</speaker>
               <p>Well, go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nic.</speaker>
               <p>Two Thirds of 36000 Pounds are 24000 Pounds for your Share, and there remains 12000 for mine. Again, Of the 40000 Crowns I pay 24000, which is three Fifths, and you pay only 16000, which is two Fifths; 24000 Crowns make 6000 Pounds, and 16000 Crowns make 4000 Pounds: 12000 and 6000 make 18000: 24000 and 4000 makes 28000. So there are 18000 Pounds to my Share of the Expences, and 28000 to yours.</p>

After <hi>Nic.</hi> had bambouzled <hi>John</hi> a while about the 18000 and the 28000, <hi>John</hi> call'd for Counters; but what with Slight of Hand, and taking from his own Score and, adding to <hi>John</hi>'s, <hi>Nic.</hi> brought the Balance always on his own ſide.</p>

new Project, and to make him uneaſie in his own Family. He had corrupted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuded moſt of his Servants into the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganteſt Conceits in the World, that their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was run mad, and wore a Dagger in one Pocket, and Poiſon in the other; that he had told his Wife and Children to <hi>Lewis,</hi> diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited his Heir, and was going to ſettle his Eſtate upon a Pariſh Boy; that if they did not look after their Maſter, he would do ſome very miſchievous Thing. When <hi>John</hi> came home he found a more ſurpriſing Scene than any he had yet met with, and that you will ſay was ſomewhat extraordinary.</p>
            <p>He call'd his Cook-maid <hi>Betty</hi> to beſpeak his Dinner, <hi>Betty</hi> told him, <hi>That ſhe beg'd his Pardon; ſhe could not dreſs Dinner till ſhe knew what he intended to do with his Will.</hi> Why <hi>Betty,</hi> Forſooth (quoth <hi>John</hi>) thou art not run mad art thou?

            <p>I Think it is but ingenuous to acquaint the Reader, that this Chapter was not wrote by Sir <hi>Humphry</hi> himſelf, but by another very able <hi>Pen</hi> of the Univerſity of <hi>Grubſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> had (by ſome good Inſtructions that was given him by Sir <hi>Roger</hi>) got the better of his Cholerick Temper, and wrought himſelf up to a great ſteadineſs of Mind, to purſue his own Intereſt through all Impediments that were thrown in the way; he began to leave off ſome of his old Aquaintance, his roaring and bullying about the Streets; he put on a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Air, knit his Brows, and for the time had made a very conſiderable progreſs in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, conſidering that he had been kept a ſtranger to his own Affairs. However, he could not help diſcovering ſome remains of his Nature, when he happen'd to meet with a Foot-Ball, or a Match at Cricket; for which Sir <hi>Roger</hi> was ſure to take him to task. <hi>John</hi> was walking about his Room with folded Arms, and a moſt thoughtful Countenance, his Servant brought him Word that one <hi>Lewis</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0488800900:26"/>
               <hi>Baboon</hi> below wanted to ſpeak with him. <hi>John</hi> had got an Impreſſion that <hi>Lewis</hi> was ſo deadly a cunning Man, that he was afraid to venture himſelf alone with him: At laſt he took heart of Grace. <hi>Let him come up</hi> (quoth he) <hi>it is but ſticking to my Point, and he can never over-reach me.</hi>

               <p>Monſieur <hi>Bull</hi> I will frankly acknowledge, that my Behaviour to my Neighbours has been ſomewhat uncivil, and I believe you will readily grant me, that I have met with Uſage accordingly. I was fond of Back-ſword and Cudgel play from my Youth, and I now bear in my Body many a black and blue Gaſh and Scars, God knows. I had as good a Ware-houſe, and as fair Poſſeſſions as any of my Neighbours, tho' I ſay it; but a contentious Temper, flattering Servants, and unfortunate Stars, have brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Circumſtances that are not unknown to you. Theſe my Misfortunes are heighten'd by domeſtick Calamities, that I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. I am a poor old batter'd Fellow, and I would willingly end my Days in Peace: But alas, I ſee but ſmall hopes of that, for every new Circumſtance affords an Argument to my Enemies to purſue their Revenge; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I was to be bang'd becauſe I was too Strong, and now becauſe I am too Weak to reſiſt, I am to be brought down when too Rich, and oppreſſed when too Poor. <hi>Nic. Frog</hi> has uſed me like a <hi>Scoundrel;</hi> You are a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0488800900:27"/>
Gentleman, and I freely put my ſelf in your Hands, to diſpoſe of me as you think fit.</p>

               <p>Look you, Maſter <hi>Baboon,</hi> as to your Uſage of your Neighbours, you had beſt not dwell too much upon that Chapter; let it ſuffice at preſent that you have been met with, you have been rolling a great Stone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill all your Life, and at laſt it has come tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling down till it is like to cruſh you to pieces: Plain-dealing is beſt. If you have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mark, Mr. <hi>Baboon,</hi> whereby one may know when you Fib, and when you ſpeak Truth, you had beſt tell it me, that one may proceed accordingly; but ſince at preſent I know of none ſuch, it is better that you ſhould truſt me, than that I ſhould truſt you.</p>

                  <p>When I conſider the late ill Uſage I have met with from you, I was reflecting what it was that could provoke you to it; but upon a narrow Inſpection into my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, I can find nothing to reproach my ſelf with, but too partial a Concern for your Intereſt. You no ſooner ſet this Compoſition a-foot, but I was ready to comply, and prevented your very Wiſhes; and the Affair might have been ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, had it not been for the greater Concerns of <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                     <hi>South,</hi> and the other poor Creatures, embark'd in the ſame Common Cauſe, whoſe Safety touches me to the Quick. You ſeem'd a little jealous that I bad dealt unfairly with you in Money-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0488800900:31"/>
till it appear'd by your own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that there was ſomething due to me upon the Ballance. Having nothing to anſwer to ſo plain a Demonſtration, you began to complain as if I had been fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with your Reputation; when it is well known, not only I, but the meaneſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in my Family, talk of you with the utmoſt Reſpect. I have always, as far as in me lies, exhorted your Servants and Tenants to be dutiful; not that I any ways meddle in your domeſtick Affairs, which were very unbecoming for me to do. If ſome of your Servants expreſs their great Concern for you in a manner that is not ſo very polite, you ought to impute it to their extraordinary Zeal, which deſerves a Reward rather than a Reproof. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reproach me for want of Succeſs at the <hi>Salutation,</hi> ſince I am not Maſter of the Paſſions and Intereſts of other Folks.
