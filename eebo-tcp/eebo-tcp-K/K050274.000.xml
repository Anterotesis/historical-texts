            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was many Years ago ſince
the <hi>French</hi> Court regretted
very much the hight of the
Publick Credit in <hi>England,</hi>
they look'd upon it as the Great, and
perhaps the only Advantage that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had over them in the War, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That by the Eſtabliſh'd Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Publick Funds here, and
the Authority of Parliamentary Credit,
whatever Sum of Money was Voted
in <hi>England,</hi> tho' the Funds did not
produce it in many Years, and tho' the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0040400500:3"/>
Loans were prodigiouſlp Great, yet the
Pnblick could command the Money in
a few Days, perhaps in a few Hours,
Five and twenty Hundred Thouſand
Pound Sterling, an Immenſe Sum told
out into <hi>French</hi> Livres, has been Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
to the Engraftment of the Bank
in a few Hours: Lotteries of a Million
have been fill'd before the Lottery it
ſelf could be paſs'd in Parliament, and
before it could be Imagin'd poſſible to
Crowd into the Office, the Tickets
have been all Subſcrib'd, and the Mony
all immediately paid in.</p>
            <p>This was as much the Terror of our
Neighbours, as it was the Honour and
Advantage of <hi>England;</hi> and Foreigners
have been heard to ſay, That there was
no getting the better of <hi>England</hi> by Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
No, tho' Victory was always on their
ſide. That while we had thus an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible
Storehouſe of Money, no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
in the Field, could be a Match
for this ſuperiority of Treaſure; for
Money being the Baſis of the War, in
the Modern way of carrying ſuch things
on in the World, it had long ſince been
a receiv'd Maxim in the Caſe of War,
That the longeſt Purſe, not the longeſt
Sword, would be ſure to Conquer at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0040400500:4"/>
laſt: As in two Mens Boxing, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
he that had the ſtrongeſt Arm,
but he that had the longeſt Breath,
would be ſure to have the better of
his Enemy.</p>
            <p>It was in vain that the late King of
<hi>France,</hi> tho' he had an Abſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Greateſt, and at firſt the
Wealthieſt Nation in the World, tryed
all the Methods, all the Arts that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Wit could Invent to raiſe a Fund
of Credit in his Kingdom, and could
never bring it to paſs; the whole
Council of <hi>France</hi> could never dictate
to him the Method how it ſhould be
done: This Coy Miſtreſs, call'd Credit,
could never be woo'd; the more he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
her, or the farther he follow'd her,
the faſter ſhe fled from him; and he
had the continual Mortification to ſee
his National Credit fall, even by the
ſame Methods which made our Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Credit riſe; and as our Credit here
grew daily, and at laſt encreaſed to ſuch
a hight, that from paying Twelve and
Fourteen <hi>per Cent.</hi> for Money, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
with infinite Difficulties to get it
brought in, we came to reducing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſt
from Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> to Five <hi>per Cent.</hi>
and now to have the publick Command
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0040400500:5"/>
of what Money they pleas'd at Four <hi>per
Cent.</hi> and have it brought in faſter than
they could take it, or had any occaſion
for it.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible to ſet down here,
the Schemes, Projects, and infinite
Arts and ſecret Practiſes which the King
of <hi>France</hi> uſed to command Credit; all
which were diſappointed and blown up,
by the frequent Exigences of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, forcing him to violate the
Faith and Honour of his Edicts, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſuch or ſuch a Fund of Intereſt to
be Sacred and Unalterable, and not to
be ſtop'd upon any account whatever;
and the next Year, or perhaps ſooner,
breaking thro' all thoſe Sacred Edicts,
ſuppreſſing the Payment, and leaving
the Lenders to Starve: Whereas in
<hi>England</hi> one Parliament always Voted
the making good the Deficiencies of
another; and no miſapplication of
Money could be made, but every Fund
was kept Sacred to its particular ſpecial
Appropriation; So that no Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
having lent his Money to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
on the Credit of a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Fund, has been Deſrauded of his
Property.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0040400500:6"/>
Thus the Arbitrary Government of
the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Property of
every Man being intirely at his Diſpoſe,
deſtroy'd the very Reaſon and Nature
of Publick Credit; and the Limited
Power of <hi>Great-Britains</hi> Crown, the
Strings of the Purſe being in the hands
of the Parliament, whoſe Appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if I may be allow'd to ſpeak ſo
plain, even our Kings themſelves durſt
not break in upon, has been the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Foundation of ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe,
boundleſs Credit, that nothing
can hurt or deſtroy, unleſs the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould Invert their way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and take into their hands the ſame
Abſolute Power which it is their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Reſtrain, and Wound and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
themſelves, that is to ſay, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom they Repreſent.</p>
            <p>But Fate and the Fortune of <hi>France</hi>
has now turn'd the Tables upon us, and
we ſee the ſame Arbitrary Power that
in the late Reign in <hi>France</hi> plung'd them
into an inſuperable Debt, and into an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable
ſtate of Deficiency and Diſcount,
I ſay, the ſame Arbitrary Power
has rais'd an inconceivable Species of
meer Air and Shadow, realizing Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Imaginations, Viſions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0040400500:7"/>
and making the meer ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Things, act all the Parts,
and perform all the Offices of the
Things themſelves; and thus in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their Debts are all vaniſh'd, the
Subſtance is anſwer'd by the Shadow;
and the People of <hi>France</hi> are made the
Inſtruments of putting the Cheat upon
themſelves, the Name of the thing
is made an Equivalent to the Thing it
ſelf, tranſpoſing the Debts from the
King to themſelves, and being contented
to Diſcharge the Publick, owe the
Money to one another.</p>
            <p>As this is the meer Conſequence of
a boundleſs Power in the King by
which he is made able to put every
Scheme, however impracticable in
other places, in a Courſe of Opperation
there; ſo that very Limitation of
Power, which is in other Caſes our
Glory and Advantage, is the Reaſon
why, let our Credit be what it will,
our Debts remain, and muſt be waſted
or diminiſhed off, by the ſlow fire of
Parliamentary Proceedings, and by no
other way.</p>
            <p>And thus for once in the World,
Tyranny has the whip hand of Liberty;
for nothing can be done in <hi>England</hi> like
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0040400500:8"/>
this, even the Parliament it ſelf is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and there are its redeemable and
unredeemable Funds the laſt of which
are a Burthen, nothing but the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Ninety Nine</hi> (Years) can put an
end to: But in <hi>France</hi> they have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
liberty to act as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Let no Man miſtake me here, as if
I were bewailing the Incumbrances of
National Privileges, and ſuggeſting
that it was Pity we ſhould be a Nation
of Liberty with ſuch a Burthen of
Debt; on the other hand, let us be,
ſay I, a free Nation deep in Debt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a Nation of Slaves Owing
nothing; and indeed even in this the
Condition of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſtands
in a poſture much to our Advantage
when compared together, namely
<hi>France,</hi> a Kingdom immenſely Rich as
a Government, wretchedly Poor as a
People; <hi>England,</hi> a Government Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs'd
in Debt, Exhauſted of Funds,
and not able (eaſily) to get out of
Debt; But as a People immenſely Rich,
Rich in the particular and private
Wealths of the Subjects; Poor, that
is to ſay, Encumbred in Debt, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the publick ſtate of Things as a
Government, and yet with all this,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0040400500:9"/>
while the publick Credit remains, we can
never be ſaid to be Poor: But of that
in another Place, and on another Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>It remains now, that we look into
this ſlagrant Deluſion of paying a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Debts, as it is Practiſing upon the
Ignorant People in <hi>France:</hi> Never in
my Opinion, was any Number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſo hook'd in to put a ſham upon
themſelves, and then call it paying off
the King's Debts, or the publick Debts;
for, as above, 'tis no more and no leſs,
than a parcel of Fools Diſcharging the
King of his Debts, and Owing it to
one another. And this is another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this piece of Magic in <hi>France,</hi>
for the very Want of Credit in <hi>France,</hi>
has been the Reaſon of their obtaining
the Credit of paying their Debts.
This Paradox ſhall be unriddled im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
thus: Had not the Publick
Credit been bad, had not the State
Bills, that is to ſay, the publick Credit
run at Sixty to Sixty three <hi>per Cent.</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the People would never have
brought themſelves to part with them
for the Bonds, or Shares in a New
Company; a Brat of State, which has
its Life in the King's Breath, and muſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0040400500:10"/>
die whenever that Breath pleaſes to
determine it, that live by the favour of
the King, and Conſequently always
lives at his Mercy; juſt thus, turn the
Tables again, I ſay, juſt thus ſtands the
Caſe in <hi>England</hi> Reverſt, the goodneſs
of the Publick Credit in <hi>England,</hi> is the
reaſon why we ſhall never be out of
Debt; for where is the Man that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lent his Money to the Publick on
the Credit of Parliamentary Security,
will upon a whim, Diſcharge that Fund,
and take a precarious Company of
Private Men for the Money.</p>
            <p>The Funds are our Security, and we
are ſatisfyed fully in the ſafety of thoſe
Funds, becauſe made Sacred by the
Authority of Parliament; this is our
advantage who are private Men, and
have our Eſtates there; but this is a
blow to the very poſſibility of paying
the publick Debts, becauſe no Man is
out of Love with his Security, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no better Security can be propoſed by
any Man.</p>
            <p>From theſe Premiſes, I come down to
the very Extraordinary Mr. <hi>Laws,</hi> a
Man, who being firſt acquainted with the ſolid Immovable ſtate of Credit in <hi>England,</hi> and ſeeing the fluctuating

alſo, how eaſie it was to puſh thoſe
things there, which he could not ſo
much as think of in <hi>England,</hi> without
apprehenſions of being pull'd in pieces
by the Rabble.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> did, who
wiſely concluded, that a foundation of
Credit muſt be laid before any ſufficient
Project could be founded upon it, I ſay,
the firſt thing Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> did, was to
Contemplate the Raiſing a Royal Bank
in <hi>France,</hi> this he Effected by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the King, whoſe Sanction
there, as the Parliament would be here,
was abſolutely neceſſary for ſuch a
Work.</p>
            <p>Now let the Schemes Engrafted ſince,
or then deſign'd to be Engrafted upon
the foot of this beginning be what they
will, whether Knaviſh or Sincere,
as I will not take upon me here to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine;
yet I ſay, let it be one way
or other, 'tis Evident Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> made a
Right Judgment, and that nothing
could be projected for the publick Service
of any kind, without an Eſtabliſh'd
Credit to Center ſome where.</p>
            <p>As I have ſaid already, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
this should be gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Government, the Endeavours to bring

by the frequent Exigencies of that
Government, forcing them to break in
upon themſelves, mortgage Faith and
Honour, Royal Edicts, and Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
the ſtrongeſt Engagements that
could at that time be made; by which
means the few Men that had any Money,
were made Cautious, and were grown
too Wiſe to put it into hands which they
could not depend upon for the Demand
of it again, when it ſhould be wanted.</p>
            <p>It remain'd then to reſolve, that
Credit could now, be only raiſed upon
the forming Societies of Private Men,
who were Maſters of Caſh, and able
to Support the Credit they took, with
whom it might be ſafe to venture the
Depoſite of Money, and who by an
Exact Currency of payments, might in
Conſequence, and by Degrees, obtain
the name or Title of a ſafe Fund, and
become the Center of proper Credit for
the whole Kingdom; a thing at that
time greatly wanted, for the advantage
of Trade in <hi>France,</hi> as well as for the
Purpoſe deſign'd by Mr. <hi>Laws.</hi> This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
by the nature of the thing, would
be called a Bank, and would be managed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0040400500:17"/>
by the firſt Adventuters in their own
right, and independent of the King or
of any Branch of the Government; ſo
that except by meer Plunder, even all
one as by Rifling the City of <hi>Paris,</hi>
the King could never lay his hand upon
any thing which was put into their
keeping.</p>
            <p>This was a well lay'd deſign, had
there been no more <hi>intended</hi> than was
<hi>pretended.</hi> For upon the Credit and
Capital Stock of the firſt Subſcribers,
there was immediately a Clear proſpect
of a Currant Running Caſh, Eſtabliſh'd
upon juſt Foundations, and Sufficient
to anſwer all the buſineſs of <hi>France;</hi> I
mean ſuch buſineſs as was fit for the
managment of a Bank.</p>
            <p>When this Scheme was ſhew'd to the
Regent, he was too penetrating not to
ſee immediately, that it was too Beneficial
a thing not to be Encouraged, as well
for the Credit of the Nation in General,
as for the uſe of the Government in
Particular; and therefore received it
with open Arms, and aſſured Mr. <hi>Laws</hi>
of his Favour and Protection: But this
was not all, for every day giving new
lights into the thing it ſelf, and new
proſpects arriſing every day, the Regent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0040400500:18"/>
who begun even then to ſee that there
was nothing which might not be hoped
for from ſuch a Deſign, as well for the
Service of the Government as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Commerce in General, and
of Private Perſons intereſted in it in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
for really a Face of publick
Credit was a new thing in <hi>France,</hi> and
had ſo long been Deſir'd, and ſo often
Endeavoured without Succeſs, that it
look'd like a Dream, and that Man that
pretended to undertake it, was like an
Angel come from Heaven to bring them
good Tidings. From this time forward
Mr. <hi>Laws,</hi> as he well deſerv'd, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with great Diſtinction, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſuch Privacies as became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
by the Importance of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking;
and as they found his firſt
Scheme Fruitful of great Improvement,
he was Encouraged to apply his
thoughts Effectually to thoſe Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that ſomething might be brought
to paſs for the publick good, and Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to reſtore Credit to <hi>France,</hi> a thing
the whole Kingdom, but eſpecially as a
Government, had ſuffered many Year
for the want of.</p>
            <p>In proſecution of this Confidence,
the Bank was Eſtabliſhed, the Patents
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0040400500:19"/>
or Charter, as we would call it here, were
Expedited for its Foundation; the King
begins the Subſcription, the Duke
Regent follows, and innumerable others;
they are Impower'd to take in a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Millions Original Stock, and to
give out Bills for Currant Caſh payable
at Demand, and to the Bearer, juſt after
the manner in <hi>England;</hi> and from that
time to this they have acted juſt as ours
do here, are managed by a Court of
Directors, for the Governing daily, every
incident that may happen, and having
preſerv'd their Credit in payments In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably,
it is not eaſie to concieve what
Stocks of Money they have brought
into their Hands, and to what monſtruous degree of Credit they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
arrived.</p>
            <p>Their buſineſs is juſt as it is with our
Bank here; they receive and Pay vaſt
Sums of Money for the King and their
Bills paſs in the Royal Treaſury at
Ready Money; they have built a New
Bureau or Office, and it was a prodigy
not often ſeen in <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſee about
Three hundred Carriages Loaden with
Silver and Gold, carried under the Guard
of a par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of Dragoons, through the
Streets to the New Houſe, where they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0040400500:20"/>
made a large Vault, which they call
the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> for the keeping it ſafe
and preſerving with it their Writings,
Pledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They lend Money upon Jewels,
Plate, and things of real Value, not
Periſhable by keeping; and upon Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of Lands at three <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt;
they Diſcount Bills, and take in Money,
Iſſuing Bills of Credit payable at De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and it is inconcievable the mighty
Encreaſe of buſineſs they have upon
their hands in ſo little time, and the
immenſe Sums of Money they have by
them in Specie.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> having thus ſucceſsfully
finiſhed this great Affair, was at Leaſure
to enquire what further Projects might
be founded upon this of a Royal Bank
He was too knowing not to have in his
Head the General Idea of all thoſe
things which have happened ſince, tho'
not perhaps of the Succeſs they have
met with, which I cannot but believe
have Exceeded his own Expectation:
But he that knew that nothing could
be done without a Fund of Credit firſt
Eſtabliſhed, knew alſo that ſuch a Fund
of Credit being once throughly Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
nothing could miſcarry that was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0040400500:21"/>
founded upon it; for as half the Projects
In the World fail, and become abortive
for want of ready Money and Credit,
ſo when once a Project is backed and
ſupported with a fluſh of Ready Money,
they muſt be weak Mannagers indeed,
if they miſcarry; for being well backed,
the Execution is in a manner ſecured.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing of Moment he went
upon, was the planting a Collony in
the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or in <hi>North-America;</hi> not
that Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> did not know that the
Planting the <hi>Louiſiania;</hi> or the Country
on the River <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any great Effects, at leaſt in his
time; for the Settling a Collony, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
proſperous in its begining is a Work
of time, and muſt take up not many
Years only, but ages of Years; and
that the utmoſt he could have before
him in ſuch an Undertaking, was to die
in the Faith of its ſucceſs, and to have
the Satisfaction of having his Name
very much talked of when he was
Dead.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Laws,</hi> like a Man of juſt Reach
and Penetration, knew that two things
would be abſolutely neceſſary to his
Deſign, I. To have the King approve
and Embark in his deſigns, and, 2. To
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0040400500:22"/>
make his Scheme Popular, to have
ſomething in View that ſhould look
Capital; have a view and proſpect of
Succeſs, beyond, not only what he
could manage, but even beyond what
he ever intended in the Propoſal.</p>
            <p>Having ſtarted the Project of Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi,
he branch'd it out in a Different
manner from all Projects; for he did
not deſcend from the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi> Scheme
as the General, to the ſubſequent things
as the Particulars; but he aſcended from
the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi> Scheme as a Particular, to
a <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company as the General;
and a General it was, fruitful of many
Particulars, every one in themſelves,
capable of as great things, and perhaps
greater than the Planting the Colonies
of <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi> was in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>When the Company was thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
his next work was to propoſe the
Foundation on which they were to be
Eſtabliſh'd, and this was a Subſcription
of Stock; and here he ſhewed his firſt
Maſterly Stroke, and that he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
all the ſteps and meaſures of his
Management from the beginning: The
Publick Credit in <hi>France</hi> was ſtill low,
nor did the Riſing Credit of the Royal
Bank add any thing to it, but rather
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0040400500:23"/>
diminiſh'd, it and let the World ſee that
private Credit in <hi>France</hi> might revive,
but publick Credit could not: The
State Bills, and Credits, Annuities on
the Town-houſe, Loans, and all the
publick Papers which the Government
had Drawn the People in to part with
their Money to purchaſe, were at this
time exceeding low, namely from 57,
to 63 <hi>per Cent.</hi> loſs, and like to be more;
it was the eaſSieſt thing in the World
to Eſtabliſh a Fund for any New Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
that was but tollerablypromiſing,
where the Subſcribers could be allow'd
to ſubſcribe theſe Dying Credits at a
PAR, and put that into Stock at 100
Livres, which Coſt the Purchaſer but
37 to 40 Livres <hi>per Cent.</hi> And this thing
alone fill'd his Subſcription, which at
firſt conſiſted of 100 Millions, and was
very quickly full.</p>
            <p>The firſt Bite Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> may be ſaid
to put upon the Country was, to give
out by way of <hi>premio,</hi> Ten Thouſand
Piftoles, or thereabouts, at the Rate of
<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>per Cent.</hi> for the Refuſing of the <hi>Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi,</hi>
or <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Stock, now ſubſcrib'd
and full, at 100 Livres each Action for a
Years time: This was what we call, <hi>The
baying of the Bear-skin;</hi> and was a dear
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0040400500:24"/>
Bear skin to thoſe that ſold it, as we
ſhall hear preſently.</p>
            <p>This was the time they begun to
banter Mr. <hi>Laws:</hi> Some ſaid he was
Mad, and knew not what to do with
his Money; others Laugh'd at him,
and ſaid, He was not in <hi>England,</hi> where
he could hedge one way to day, and
another way to morrow; could give in
the morning and take in the afternoon;
And thus they took the Money greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not Conſidering what might be hid
under the management of a Man whoſe
Talent they had not yet tryed.</p>
            <p>I purpoſely paſs over here the many
Movements which Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> made in
this part, to ſecure to himſelf the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
he ſhould get by the Riſe of his
Stock; for he who had the Power of
adding Credit to his Project whenever
he pleas'd, had nothing to do but to
make ſure of the Profits of the firſt
Riſe to himſelf; and therefore he took
Care to give out his whole Sum, as I
have heard, of 10000 Piſtoles, before
he ſet his other Wheels at work. And
after this let us ſee how he went on:</p>
            <p>He had now a Bank of Currant Caſh
Eſtabliſh'd on one hand; this he has
kept free and unconcern'd in all Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0040400500:25"/>
or Projects, as what might one way
or other ſhake their Credit; but he kept
them perfectly unincumbred, always
able to anſwer all Demands upon them,
and to reſiſt every ſhock that might be
made upon them, by the force of their
ready Money in ſpecie; none of which
he would ſuffer to be Diminiſhed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by Loans on ſufficient Securities.
And I ſhall give preſently an Account
how this method was their real Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and how they had been overthrown
at once, by the Chicannry of their and
his Enemies if this Courſe had not been
taken; of which by and by.</p>
            <p>He had on the other hand a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of Adventurers, as they might
truly be call'd; and as the nature of the
thing indeed Imported, whoſe Stock
did not coſt them much, being bought
as above; with what Coſt them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
37 to 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and even was
not indeed very Currant at that Price
neither: Theſe therefore were fit to run
any reaſonable riſque, to embark in any
probable Undertaking; to advance the
Credit of that Undertaking; and, if
poſſible, to raiſe their Imaginary Stock,
for it was no more at firſt, to a Real
Stock of 100 Livres in Value, for 100
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0040400500:26"/>
Livres Subſcription; and the way how
to do this, therefore was the next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
buſineſs of the Company to Conſider.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be Enquir'd was,
to find out ſomething to do, ſomething
to Trade in, for as to Planting in
<hi>Meſſiſſippi,</hi> tho' that was to be kept going
on, as the Denominating Buſineſs of
the whole; yet it was plain, that Mr.
<hi>Laws</hi> never Deſign'd a Hundred Millions
of Livres ſhould be Employ'd in People<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Wilderneſs: He therefore turns
back to the King, from whom he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Life of the whole, and by
whoſe Authority and Buſineſs all the
Wheels were to be ſet to Work.</p>
            <p>The Publick was a large Field, were
one Man has no Credit, and another
great Credit; 'tis eaſy to ſee who of
the two ſhould be the gainer by the
other: He that has no Credit can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without Money, he that has
Credit wants no Money tho' he has
none.</p>
            <p>A Government ſunk into Debt, and
her Securities bought at 60 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
Diſcount, gives Room for vaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
where the Party has Money to
work with; in a Word the Buſineſs
was to buy Low, and then bring up
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0040400500:27"/>
the Price of what was bought; namely
to buy at 60 <hi>per Cent.</hi> coſt, and then
fell at a PAR, as we now ſee is ſince
done.</p>
            <p>The King, I ſay, was their firſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
they had to deal with, and theſe
were the Goods he had to ſell (<hi>viz.</hi>)
State Bills of Several Kinds, Annuities,
Intereſts on Loans, Rents of the Town-Houſe,
and the like; and here I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that the performing this Wonder
I'am now to ſpeak of, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of Reſtoring
the publick Credit, ſo as to bring a Sum
ſo monſtrouſly great as Fifteen Hundred
Millions, and ſunk ſo very low as from
60 to 65 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Diſcount, to be Sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
at a PAR; nay to 10, 20, and 30
<hi>per Cent.</hi> advance, for that they would
have been at, but Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> himſelf
Checkt it; I ſay the Entertaining a
thought that ſuch a Scheme was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
and laying a Scheme to do it, was
as great a Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Laws</hi>
Genius and Capacity, as the Performance
has been of his good Fortune.</p>
            <p>It was a Sea, ſo full of dangerous Shoals,
and Rocks, ſo ſubject to ſudden Storms
and Hurricanes, in a Word, ſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of certain Shipwreck; that no
Pilot but this alone, would ever have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0040400500:28"/>
ventured to have Launched out in
it.</p>
            <p>But we muſt ceaſe the Wondering,
and go back beyond Wonder it ſelf,
Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> had begun well, the Bank
was Eſtabliſh'd, and began to gain upon
the World; the Credit of it, as I have
already obſerv'd, appear'd openly, and
ſeem'd to be Invulnerable; it was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon a Subſtantial baſis, nay, indeed
the only baſis that could ſupport Publick
Credit, (<hi>viz.</hi>) it always had the Money
in Specie and in its own keeping, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to anſwer all Demands; upon this
almoſt any thing might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>But
here I muſt not only give another
inſtance of the maſterly Genius of
Mr. <hi>Laws,</hi> the Contriver of all theſe
things, but muſt let the World ſee, that
as no Deſign however good in it ſelf,
and adapted for the general good of
our Country, can be without Enemies,
Envy conſtantly oppoſing itſelf to the
beſt Deſigns; ſo it was here; this Bank
had a Formidable attack made upon it
by a ſet of Merchants in <hi>Paris;</hi> ſome
ſaid they were <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that they were <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants
Dwelling in <hi>Paris,</hi> and others, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0040400500:29"/>
they were <hi>French;</hi> be that as it will,
poſſibly they might be ſome of all the
three ſorts, for it could not be done by
a few: The Sum they appeared with,
being no leſs than Twenty five Millions.
The Plot in a few Words was to muſter
up a large Number of Bills, to be
Demanded altogether, and if poſſible
to give a Blow to the Credit; in a Word,
and to Expreſs it in our Terms, to make
a Run upon the Bank. The Particulars
of the Story are related thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It was a little after the firſt advance
of the Credit of the Royal Bank at
<hi>Paris,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> was the
principal Director, as he really was
the Father and Author of it; ſome
Merchants in <hi>Paris</hi> (it was reported
to be a Plot Originally laid at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
or more properly in <hi>Holland</hi>)
whether it was ſo or not we do not
affirm, but this is certain, that they
were chiefly <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants who
appeared in it at <hi>Paris;</hi> we ſay, ſome
Merchants at <hi>Paris</hi> having ſome time
before Concerted their Meaſures to
give a blow to the Bank, Treaſured
up a number of Bank Bills, to the
Sum of Twenty five Millions as ſome
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0040400500:30"/>
ſay, others Twenty two Millions of
Livres, and appear altogether, tho' in
ſeveral forms, as of ſeparate Perſons
and Intereſt, at the Bank, juſt at the
ſame Hour, to Demand the Money
for thoſe Bills.</p>
               <p>The Clarks at the Bank Surpriz'd
with the appearance of ſo many
Eminent Merchants, and with ſuch
great Demands, anſwer'd, that they
ſhould be paid, but deſir'd them to
wait a little till they could ſend to
Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> the Director, that they
might have his orders how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in paying them; accordingly
they immediately acquainted Mr.
<hi>Laws</hi> with the thing, he paus'd a
while at the thing, and without any
Supprize, after a little Conſideration,
bid them go back and tell the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
they ſhould all be paid, and
bid the Clarks begin the payment,
and to pay them all in <hi>Lowes d'or's</hi> or
<hi>Piſtoles,</hi> and that he would come Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the Office, which he
did, having firſt been to tell the
Regent his Scheme, and had the
aſſiſtance of the Royal Treaſury, and
of the General Farmers, for about
One hundred fifty thouſand Piſtoles
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0040400500:31"/>
in Specie, if he had wanted them,
which however he did not.</p>
               <p> Accordingly the Clarks begun the
payment, and it held till the next
day afternoon; by which time, as
we have the Story, an Edict was
procured and actually made Publick
to reduce the Lowis d'or's from 16 to
15 Livres, which loſs fell inſtantly
upon the Merchants, while they had
above a Million and a quarter of
Piſtoles in their Hands in Specie, and
the Bank having ſtood its Ground,
had moſt of thoſe Piſtoles in their
Cſh again in a few Days.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This was a home Thruſt at the Bank,
but as it was Parry'd with ſo much
Art, and the Loſs of it turn'd upon
the Contrivers, it Eſtabliſh'd the very
Foundation which it was form'd to
ſhake, and gave ſuch a Credit, not only
to the Bank, but to Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Manager and Director in that
Exigence, that it ſecured them both
from any future attempts of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
it alſo let the World ſee, that
not only they were ſtrong in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of their Caſh, and able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
all Demands, and not only that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0040400500:32"/>
they had a ſuperior Genius at the head
of their management, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
able to Counter-act their Projects,
but that they had the Government hard
and faſt to ſupport them upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
and this indeed was ſuch a
Foundation, that when the <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> or
<hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company was firſt formed, it
was apparent, that tho' there was little
or nothing in the thing itſelf, yet there
were other Engraftments to be made
upon it by the Government, that it could
not miſs of Succeſs; and that in a Word,
that <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> was only the Name, but
that the Thing was intended to be a
Fund of Credit, upon which the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fortunes of the Government were
to riſe again.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing we found gave life to
the Company was the Coinage, the
next was the Farm of Tobacco, either
of theſe were Things of a magnitude
ſufficient to have given Credit to any
new Fund; but ſeem'd to be but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
in the hand of the Company, who
apparently aim'd at the General Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the Revenues of <hi>France:</hi>
However, as the undertaking of the
Coinage was a vaſt thing in its Nature,
ſo the manner of the Contract, the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0040400500:33"/>
with which the Company engag'd
in it, the viſible Advantage which the
Company would make by it, and above
all the Advance which they were to
make to the King for it, were ſuch
Great things that it ſtartled the World,
and they began to talk of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>
Company, as of an Opulent Powerful
Body, that being Headed by an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
Man, who apparently had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
what never Man before him
undertook, and perfectly underſtood
what he had undertaken, had more in
it than was at firſt imagin'd, and
would arrive to ſome greater hight than
had been thought poſſible.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Thoughts, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Company's underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
beginning to be Popular, every
body enquired into it, and the farther
they look'd into it, the better they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to like it; and this ſet People firſt
upon buying the Stock, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>yers, by the meer nature
of the thing, would riſe the Value.</p>
            <p>Now it appear'd every day more
and more, that Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> had lay'd his
Meaſures right when he gave away his
Piſtoles, as I have ſaid above, to have
the refuſal of the Stock at 100 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0040400500:34"/>
for on a ſudden the Stock jumpt up to
PAR, and in three or four days more to
150. Had Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> ſtay'd the full time,
and not Demanded the Stock till it was
Advanc'd as we now ſee it riſen, he
muſt in all probability have loſt the
Advantage he had due to him, ſeeing
very few of the Perſons he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with would have been able to
make good a difference of a Stock riſen
from under a Hundred to a Thouſand:
But as he ſhew'd his Moderation in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Stock, within the advance
of about 200 <hi>per Cent.</hi> the Perſons who
loſt that Money to him, were ſoon
made amends if they had any Stock,
by finding it ſtill riſing upon their
hands to a prodigious degree in a few
days.</p>
            <p>We muſt take the liberty to make a
Digreſſion here, to the Volatile Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, whoſe levity
only can account for what we are now
to take notice of, and the warmth of
the <hi>French</hi> Temper muſt indeed be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
for the running up an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Stock; for except about 37 or 40
Livres, upon a 100 in the firſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
it was no other to ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and ſuch an unaccountable extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
hight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0040400500:35"/>
This warmth of the <hi>French</hi> Temper,
which prompts them to puſh things up
to the Extremity, was certainly the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I mean the Original Reaſon of the
ſudden Advance of theſe things, for as
yet there was no weight in the things
themſelves, that could bear any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the New Credit they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd;
The Company had indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
with the Government, and had
taken the Coinage of the King, as
above, and in Nine years it was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
they would get near Fifty Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by their Contract, provided alſo
the Government kept their Word with
them, and made no new alterations in
the Coin to their Detriment: But even
this, in an Arbitrary Adminiſtration,
ſuch as that of <hi>France</hi> is known to be,
was not ſo certain, but that the Riſque
of it was worth ſomething to Enſure;
and all the Doubt that could be juſtly
rais'd on that Head, pleaded in abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Credit of the Company.</p>
            <p>It muſt therefore, I ſay, be placed
to the account of the ſluttering, raſh
Diſpoſition of the People of <hi>France,</hi>
that a thing who had yet no farther or
greater proſpect than that of the Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
ſhould in a few days mount up its
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0040400500:36"/>
Credit to near 200 <hi>per Cent,</hi> upon the
Value.</p>
            <p>But as we are immediately to ſee
things more prodigious than this, let us
Diſcharge our ſelves of this Particular
firſt, that we may clear things as they
go; The Arret for Granting to the
Company the Coinage, as above, will
fully deſcribe the Circumſtances of
their Contract, and the View of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
they had by it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot go on, till I have given it
at large, as follows:</p>

                        <p>THE King having by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents of the Month of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1717, eſtabliſhed a Trading
Company under the Name of the
<hi>Weſt</hi> Company, and by his Edict in
<hi>May</hi> laſt reunited to the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the Trade of the <hi>Eaſt-India,
China, &amp;c.</hi> his Majeſty ſees with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
that that Company takes
the beſt Meaſures for ſecuring the
Succeſs of its Eſtabliſhment; that
they ſend a great Number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0040400500:37"/>
to the Country of <hi>Louiſiana,</hi>
which was granted them; that many
private Perſons make Settlements in
that Colony, and ſend thither Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen.
Tillers, and other Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft-men,
to manure and improve
the Land, ſow Corn, plant Tobacco,
breed Silk-worms, and do whatever
is neceſſary to improve that Country.
Furthermore, his Majeſty being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that the <hi>India</hi> Company is
at great Charges for tranſporting the
ſaid Inhabitants, and furniſhing the
Colony with Meal and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
till the Land afford a ſufficient
Quantity of Proviſion for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:
That the ſaid Company
ſends thither all ſorts of Goods and
Merchandize to render the Life of
the Inhabitants more comfortable,
and that for preventing Abuſes too
frequent in Colonies, they have taken
Care to ſettle the Price thereof at a
moderate Rate by a general Tariff,
which they have ſent thither to be
affixed in their Store-houſes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines;
that they have ordered the
Biaſters or Pieces of Eight to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by their Officers on the foot of
five Livres, and the other Silver Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0040400500:38"/>
in Proportion, which Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have appeared ſo wiſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that his Majeſty has reſolved
to favour the Execution thereof, and
knowing that the exchanging of
Goods not being ſufficient to carry on
Commerce to its full Extent, and that
it is neceſſary in the begining of
Eſtabliſhments of this Nature, to
give them all poſſible Protection and
Countenance, his Majeſty has reſolv'd
to ſupply the ſaid Company with a
Sum of Bank Bills, to enable the
Inhabitants of <hi>Louiſiana</hi> to Trade
amongſt themſelves, and bring into
<hi>France</hi> the Fruits of their Labour,
Oeconomy and Induſtry, without
any Riſque or Charge: And his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
being willing to indemnify the
ſaid Company, for the Price of the
Pieces of Eight in the <hi>Louiſina,</hi> and
for the Expences they are at for the
Eſtabliſhment and Support of that
Colony, he has thought fit to order
all the Pieces of Eight and other Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
that ſhall be imported by the ſaid
Company from the <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> to be
received at his Mints at their full
Value. Therefore his Majeſty being
in the Council, with the Advice of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0040400500:39"/>
Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
has ordered, and Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> The Articles of this Arreſt are to
the following effect: 1. That the
Treaſurer of the Bank ſhall deliver
to the <hi>India</hi> Company the Sum of
Twenty five Millions of Livres in
Bank Bills, taking a Receipt of the
Caſhier of the ſaid Company, to be
ſent to the <hi>Louiſiana.</hi> 2. That in
order that the ſaid Bills be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from others, the Numbers ſhall
be kept by the Treaſurer of the Bank,
and the ſaid Bills ſhall be ſealed with
the Seal of the <hi>India</hi> Company, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the Seal of the Bank. 3.
That the ſaid Bills being returned to
<hi>France,</hi> ſhall be paid as well as other
Bank Bills, by the Receivers of the
King's Revenues, and afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
by the Caſhier of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and by him brought to the
Treaſurer of the Bank, who ſhall
deliver them new Bank Bills to be
ſent to the <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> to the Value of
the others. 4. The Owners of the
ſaid Bills muſt take the precaution to
indorſe them, that they may not be
paid to any other but ſuch who are to
receive the Payment thereof; but in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0040400500:40"/>
caſe they are loſt by Shipwreck, or
ſtoln, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the owner upon making a
Declaration thereof to the Caſhier of
the Company, who is to enter the
Number of the Bills loſt, or ſuppoſed
to be loſt, ſhall receive the Value
thereof at the Expiration of five Years,
according to the Declaration of the
4th of <hi>December,</hi> 1718. 5. And in
order to indemnify the ſaid Company
for the Charges they are at for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
the Plantations in <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> and
for the Prices they give for the Pieces
of Eight, his Majeſty orders that the
ſaid Pieces of Eight brought from
thoſe Plantations be receiv'd at his
Mint at the rate of Sixty Livres <hi>per</hi>
Mark, and in caſe of Alteration in
the Price of the Coyn of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the Value of the ſaid Pieces of
Eight ſhall be paid Weight for
Weight in the Species that ſhall be
coyned or reformed. without any
Diminution for the Charges thereof;
and thereof as to the other Bullion,
the ſame ſhall be receiv'd and paid at
the Mint at the ſame Price as the
Pieces of Eight, upon producing a
Certificate from the General Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the ſaid Company, that the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0040400500:41"/>
ſaid Pieces of Eight and other Bullion
were ſhipped off in the Country of
<hi>Louiſiana,</hi> and belong to the ſaid

                        <p>THE King having ordered in
Council his Edict in <hi>May,</hi>
1718. whereby new Species of Gold
and Silver are ordered to be made,
to be laid before him, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
being informed, that beſides the
good effects the Coyning thereof has
produc'd, other conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
may be expected from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Attention to be given to its
Continuation. Among the ſeveral
Propoſals that have been made to
him on this Matter, none has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more Advantagious than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Directors of the <hi>India</hi>
Company, who offer to pay to his
Majeſty Fifty Millions of Livres in
Specie, in Fifteen equal ſucceſſive
Payments from Month to Month,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0040400500:42"/>
the firſt beginning on the firſt of
<hi>October</hi> next and the laſt the firſt of
<hi>December,</hi> 1720. upon Condition that
the ſaid Company ſhall enjoy for
Nine years together, to begin from
the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next the Benefit
and Advantage ariſing from the old
Species and Bullion that ſhall be
brought to the King's Mints to be
coyn'd into new Species. His Majeſty
is ſo much the more inclined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Propoſals of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
becauſe they may better and
more and conveniently than private
Men import Species and Bullion
out of Foreign Countries, and that
conſequently they may get a greater
Advantage thereby than his Majeſty
could get if the Coinage of the new
Species was continued upon his own
Account; and furthermore conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Profit that will ariſe out
of the ſame will be divided between
great numbers of his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
concerned in the ſaid Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and that a Supply ſo certain and
ready will enable his Majeſty to pay
the Arrears of Penſions and other
Expences, His Majeſty, with the
Advice of Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>

Regent, has ordained, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
as follows:</p>
                        <p>This Arreſt contains four Articles,
which are to this effect: 1. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
accepts the offer made by the
<hi>India</hi> Company of the Sum of Fifty
Millions of Livres, to be paid in
Fifteen ſucceſſive Months, to begin
from the firſt of <hi>October</hi> next, at the
rate of 3, 333, 333 Livres, 6 Pence,
8 Deniers <hi>per</hi> Month, and orders that
the ſame be brought to his Royal
Treaſury, and that the Receipt given
by the Keeper thereof be a ſufficient
Diſcharge to the ſaid Company, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being accountable to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Accounts. 2. Beſides the ſaid
Sum of Fifty Millions, the Company
is to be at all the charges of the
Coinage, Remittance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch as
the King does actually pay. 3. Up.
on theſe Conditions, the King grants
to the ſaid Company all the Profits
and Advantages that ſhall accrue
from the Coining into new Species of
Gold and Silver in his Mints, the old
Species of <hi>France,</hi> the Species of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, and Bullion that
ſhall be imported, what Sum ſoever
they may amount to, on the foot
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0040400500:44"/>
and manner regulated by the Edict of
<hi>May,</hi> 1718, for Nine Years together,
to begin from the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next.
4. His Majeſty declares, that during
the ſaid Nine Years, he will not make
any Augmentation in the Price of the
Species, nor leſſen the Standard of
his Coin upon any Pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and that in caſe of any Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he will lower the Bullion and
old Species proportionably. Done in

            <p>It was ſome Weeks that the Credit
of the Company fed upon this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and Mr. <hi>Laws,</hi> who prudently
gave every thing time to Work, let it
run on ſome time, upon this view only.
till the People began to talk a little du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
about it; That it was true, the
Company would get Money by the
Coinage, but it muſt be in a length of
time; and that this was not ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that the Stock ſhould mount up
to ſuch a hight upon that Advantage
only.</p>
            <p>When theſe things began to be the

every thing about by juſt degrees, and
to give every thing that he ſtarted into

ſelf to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>On a ſudden then, for all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were like Mines, ſprung from

given of any thing till it burſt out like
a ſudden Fire, I ſay, on a ſudden he
Declares at his Levee, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be as Great as that of a Publick
Miniſter, That the King had United
the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company to that of <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi</hi>

appear'd, by which the two Com
panies were United, and the Stock of
the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company Ingrafted into
the other Company, as by the Arret it
ſelf is beſt explain'd, and which has in
it ſeveral Clauſes infinitely to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Company, in Trade as

Commerce to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> encreaſed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0040400500:46"/>
as they might be able to encreaſe it,
were in themſelves but remote things,

ſome Years to come, and therefore
could not be an addition of an Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick

as immediately appear'd: But let us

            <p>It is not to be expreſs'd with what
ſurpriſe, and even aſtoniſhment the
World look'd on at theſe ſteps of Mr.
<hi>Laws,</hi> his Fame for an Enterprizing
Man was now Eſtabliſh'd, and thoſe
who had before run pretty much upon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0040400500:51"/>
his Crdit, and talk'd to his prejudice
among the common People, began to
ſay now he was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne habile homme,</hi> and
that he was capable of great things;
for the noiſe of this new <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company ſpread like a Clap of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
far and wide, and People began to
ſee a new world of Profit attending it,
the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade being carried on in
<hi>Great-Britain</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> to ſuch a
magnitude and to ſo much advantage,
as we all know it to be done.</p>
            <p>All this while the on looking World
regarded in their Calculations nothing
but the Profits of Trade, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
the Company might make by
great Returns, having a Capital Stock,
and a good Oeconomy in their Affairs,
keeping their eyes upon the Number of
Ships to be ſent annually to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
the Extent of their Colonies
and Plantations in the <hi>Louiſiana</hi> and on
the Banks of the <hi>Miſſiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ppi,</hi> what Rents
in time ſhall accrue to the Stock, and
what Annual Incoms the Company
would receive, whereby they would
be enabled to make Dividends propot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to 250 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
as they were then advanc'd,
not imagining what was yet behind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0040400500:52"/>
But Mr. <hi>Laws,</hi> whoſe Views lay
another way, regarded all theſe things,
only as they tended to raiſe Fund of
Credit at home, which was from the
beginning the Point he aim'd at, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all other things to work their own
way; not but the remoteſt Proſpects
concurr'd to anſwer the ſame End,
and a Complication of Advantages
however remote, ſerv'd to bring about
the great Point, <hi>viz.</hi> The making the
Credit of the whole to riſe beyond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
and ſufficient to anſwer all
the great Things he had ſtill in View.</p>
            <p>The Stock was now riſen to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
hight, from 325 to 350 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> and now was the Time for Mr.
<hi>Laws</hi> to let the world ſee what a Fund
of Credit is able to do, and to make
good the undoubted Maxim, That <hi>a
Fund of Credit, is a Fund of Money,</hi>
and able to make it ſelf equal to all
the Money in the World; for now was
the time to ſtrike the blow, that <hi>Coup
d'Eclat,</hi> which ſhould ſurprize and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the World, and which will for
ever be ſpoken of as an Action, that
the World never heard of the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0040400500:53"/>
Nor did Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> bring it out all at
once, but ſuffer'd it to be diſcours'd of
gradually, That the Company was
about to take upon them the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King's Revenue; in a few
days after, for Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> never ſuffer'd
the Town to be Maſter of his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
before they were ripe, but it had
not been long ſpoken of that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
would take upon them the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the Revenue, when at
once, juſt as before, and Arreſt was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
Diſſolving the Leaſes of the
General Farmers of the Revennue, tho'
their Leaſes had five Years to run, and
veſting the whole Collection in the new
<hi>Eaſt-Indsa</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>As an Inducement to this, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
undertake to encreaſe the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the King, no leſs than four
Millions a Year, a Sum too Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
not to be Vallued: But at the end
of this comes a Clauſe, which none
but ſuch a Man as Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> could have
ventur'd upon, a thing Poſterity will
look back upon as a Romance, and
which no Hiſtory can give any thing
like it, namely, the paying the King's
Debts, that is to ſay, the Company to
take upon them at once the Diſcharging
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0040400500:54"/>
all the King's Debts upon whatſoever
Doubtful Funds, upon whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
Circumſtances they ſtood, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Diſcounts they were at, all are to
be transferr'd at once from the Royal
Treaſury, where they would never
have been able to Diſcharge them, to
the Treaſury of the Company where
they are to be paid at Demand.</p>
            <p>Two things make this Undertaking
a Prodigy of Management, the like
of which was never heard of before:
<list>
                  <item>1. The King's Debts amounted to
about Fifteen Hundred Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</item>
                  <item>2. The Company had not any
Fund of Money, or the Value of
Money to pay them with.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But before I go on, I muſt go back
to the Arreſts or Proclamations, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
the Execution of this unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
Contract, which by miſtake is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
placed <hi>Page</hi> 49. but ſhould have
come in here.</p>
            <p>Here is ſuch a blow ſtruck, as the
World never heard of before; and in
this very ſtroke we may behold the
Power of Credit, and what immenſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0040400500:55"/>
Structures <hi>may be built,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Laws
has built</hi> upon this ſingle foundation,
by which he has reſtor'd a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
overwhelm'd with Debt and
which was turn'd Bankrupt to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and has deliver'd a Nation op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
with Taxes, in ſuch a manner,
and in ſo ſhort a time, that Poſterity
will never believe the relation, but will
all look like a Fable or Romance in
their Eyes.</p>
            <p>The Arret or Act of the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
above mention'd, for the ſettling
this Point, tells us expreſly what the
Company are to do, and expreſſes the
Sum which they are to lend the King
for the doing it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That they
ſhould lend the King Twelve Hundred
Millions of Livres at 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and
afterwards they added three Millions
more, for the paying off all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Debts, and ſtrictly ties them down
to ſo punctual a Diſcharge of thoſe
Debts, and of all the Sallaries of the
Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it ſhall be wholly in
the choice of the Perſons who are to be
paid, whether they will accept of the
Company's Bonds, or have their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Money paid them. But the Arrets
do not at all meddle with the Method
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0040400500:56"/>
by which the Company ſhall raiſe ſuch
an Infinite maſs of Money to pay, but
ſuppoſes the Money ſhall all be actually
ready in Caſh, in Specie to pay, only
gives the Company Power to Borrow
ſuch a Sum, that is to ſay, if any one
will lend it; for they do not oblige any
one to Lend, much leſs to accept the
Company's Security for the Debt; for
that would but have been exchanging
the Government for the Company, and
leaving the Debt ſtill in being.</p>
            <p>Nor on the other hand was here the
leaſt Conſideration to the Company
for ſo great an Advantage to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as that of clearing them at
once of all the publick Debts; had the
Company reſerv'd but the ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of One <hi>per Cent.</hi> on the Intereſt
as they were empowered to Borrow,
the 1200 Millions at 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> had the
Government paid 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which
had been juſt 1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Gain, there
had been then ſome viſible Profit,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) there had been Twelve Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>per Annum</hi> in the Company's Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
to have enabled them, or help'd
at leaſt, to make ſome proportion'd
Dividends to the monſtrous advance of
their Stock.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0040400500:57"/>
But the whole Scene may be one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Prodigy, they ſeek no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
they Demand no more than
Three <hi>per Cent.</hi> and propoſe to Borrow,
if they want it, at Three <hi>per Cent.</hi>
acting in every part of it upon the
foundation of Publick Service, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Gain to themſelves.</p>
            <p>But neither is this all, for we ſhall
preſently ſee them not only take no
Surplus of Intereſt, no Gain of Intereſt
more than they pay; But we ſhall ſee
the Credit riſing to an immenſe hight,
and the Company growing Powerful by
the Aſſiſtance of the Government, and
the management of Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> their
Director: I ſay, we ſhall ſee the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Myſteries, or, indeed, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
wrought in the compaſs of a few
Weeks, Things as incredible as the
greateſt Impoſſibility in Nature could
be thought to be; things which now
they are done they are as a Dream
even to thoſe that ſee them; even the
People who have the Money in their
hands, and who has receiv'd their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Debts, fo long given over, ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
deſpair'd of, they look amaz'd,
and Conſider again and again, whether
they are awake or aſleep, they handle
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0040400500:58"/>
it, weigh it, and roll it about, as if
they would try whether it is really Gold
or Air; whether there is no Magic, no
Necromancy in it or not; and I am
told of one to whom the Government
ow'd Ten Thouſand Crowns, which
he would have been glad to have ſold
for Two Thouſand five Hundred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Arrear for Secret Service only,
that cauſed an Iron Cheſt to be bought,
and put the Money into it, then drove
Poſts into the Ground in his Cellar,
and chain'd the Iron Cheſt down to
the Stakes, then chain'd it alſo to the
Wall, and Barricadoed the Doors and
Window of the Cellar with Iron, and
all for fear, not of Thieves to Steal the
Money, but for fear the Money, Cheſt
and all ſhould fly away into the Air;
For he ſaid he could never believe it
was Money. But to return to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
which I ſay have been done by
this Company, ſubſequent to this new
Arret of paying the publick Debts:
We have ſeen them ſince that do ſtrange
things indeed!</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. We have ſeen them bring the
People to refuſe payment, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
payment of what they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0040400500:59"/>
would before have given half the
Debt to be ſecur'd of.</item>
               <item>2. The State Bills that were before
little better than waſt Paper,
made worth 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and 20
<hi>per Cent.</hi> above PAR.</item>
               <item>3. We have ſeen them Gain Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Hundred and Fifty Millions
of Money in leſs than a Months
time by ſelling the Air, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a real Value upon an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
value.</item>
               <item>4. We have ſeen the King's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
augmented to Millions a
year, by abating the Taxes to
the People.</item>
               <item>5. We have ſeen the General Farms
rais'd Four Millions a Year to
the King, and yet twelve
Millions a Year paid leſs by the
People.</item>
               <item>6. We have ſeen them Pay Fifteen
Hundred Millions of Debt for
the King, without one Penny of
Money.</item>
               <item>7. Laſtly, We have ſeen a private
Gentleman raiſe himſelf by the
Dexterity of this Management,
to be the greateſt Subject in the
World; to have all the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0040400500:60"/>
the Princes, the Publick
Miniſters, and even the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
it ſelf at his beck, and
above 300 Coaches in a Morning
at his Levee, himſelf behaving
with all the Modeſty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
imaginable; not Elevated
by his good Fortune, not Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
or Diſcompos'd by the
application to ſo much buſineſs,
but Calm and Cool, always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to himſelf, anſwering brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and pertinently to every new
Diſcourſe, receiving Six or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Hundred Gentlemen in a
Morning, diſpatching every Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
with a Readineſs inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable,
perfectly Compos'd and
Retir'd, and every Day produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
new Wonders in the great
Affair of the Publick which is
upon his Hands.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I return to the Stock, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of the Company: As the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Publick buſineſs thus flow'd in,
the Credit of the Stock neceſſarily Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd;
and we were ſurpriz'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to find that every Poſt the Price
ſtarted up whole Hundreds in a Day,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0040400500:61"/>
till at length we ſaw the Stock up at
1150 <hi>per Cent.</hi> 1200, and ſince that to
2050 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now was the Juncture of Mr. <hi>Laws</hi>
to give the blow he had in View, the
multitude of People who came every
Hour to <hi>Paris,</hi> and run their Money
into the Stock, made his Project not
Rational only but Natural, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
That they might enlarge the Capital
Stock by Engrafting a farther Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
and that the New Subſcribers
might have Encouragement to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
they ſhould be allowed to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
at 1000 Livres each, Original
Stock.</p>
            <p>Purſuant to this Reſolution, an Arreſt
was publiſhed, empowering the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to take new Subſcriptions upon
the firſt Foot of the Stock for 50 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
the Subcribers paying 10000
Livres each; and that I may explain
it as I go, you are to underſtand, that
for the Ten Thouſand Livres, the Sub-ſcribers
has Credit in the Companies
Books for one Action or Share, that is
to ſay, for One Hundred Livres Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Stock.</p>
            <p>This being the Caſe, it is eaſie to
Calculate what the Company's Gain by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0040400500:62"/>
by this new Subſcription, but of that
in its Place: In the mean, time it is to
obſerv'd, that ſo eager were the People
to throng in their Money into the Stock,
that they were ready to tread one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to death to get to the Books, and
it was the greateſt Favour in the
world to be admitted; ſo that the
Books were not only fill'd up in about
Six Hours, but if there had been room
for Two Hundred Millions, it would
have been fill'd up at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the Subſcription de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
full, and no more hands to be
taken, but thoſe who could not get in
their Money, falls to work with thoſe
that had, and buy of them part of
what they had ſubſcrib'd, and this
rais'd the Price ſo, that the new Stock
riſe immediately 100 <hi>per Cent.</hi> even the
ſame day that it was ſubſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>As this had been clos'd with ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and with ſo much ardour by the
People, Mr. <hi>Laws,</hi> who knew very well
how to make his Advantage of the
Temper of the People, obtains a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Order for 50 Millions more, and
in a Word had it fill'd with the ſame
eagerneſs and forwardneſs as before,
and after this a third of 50 Millions;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0040400500:63"/>
the Arreſt of theſe Subſcriptions are
publick in our Papers, and will ſhew
ſomething of the Proof of what I have
affirm'd, of the forwardneſs of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers;
they are indeed too long to be
Copied here, neither is it of great uſe
to us to ſee the Form, which is only
what is uſual in the Publick Acts on like
Occaſions.</p>
            <p>It is now proper to Examine what
Immenſe Gain accrues to the Company
by theſe Subſcriptions, as alſo the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Stock as then Advanc'd: I begin
with the Subſcriptions, which, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
were taken in at a 1000 Livres
upon each 100 Livres Original Stock.</p>
            <p>If then the Subſcription was for Fifty
Millions Stock, at 100 Livres each Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
this advanc'd to a 1000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,
each Stock amounts to no leſs
than 500 Millions of Livres; ſo that
the Company receiving 1000 Millions
of Livres, for 50 Millions Original
Stock, advance, and are clear Gainers
by the Subſcription no leſs than 450
Millions of Livres, and this doubled
by the ſecond Subſcription of 50 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make the Company's Gain amount
to 900 Millions of Livres, and that to
a third, it makes it 1350 Millions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0040400500:64"/>
Add to this, the firſt Stock of the
Company was much of it Subſcrib'd
by the Government itſelf, by the King,
by Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> as in the Company's
Name, and being ſold ſince at 1000
and 1100 <hi>per Cent.</hi> has put, as I am
credibly inform'd, above 200 Millions
into their Pockets; beſides what Mr.
<hi>Laws</hi> is ſaid to have Gain'd for his
private Account.</p>
            <p>It will now be no longer a Wonder
how, and with what Coin the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſhould undertake to pay off 1500
Millions of Debt, or how they could
begin to pay, as was the Caſe, Four
Months before the appointed Time,
for here is 1340 Millions Clearly gain'd,
<hi>Tout d'une Coup,</hi> at one blow, to go on
upon the payment with whenever they
pleas'd, beſides what was to come;
and no body then doubted but that Mr.
<hi>Laws</hi> would ſet up a third Subſcription;
but he found it convenient to ſtop here
for the preſent, and not only not to
take a farther Subſcription, but to put
that out of doubt, he obtain'd a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Arret declaring, that there ſhould
be no new Subſcriptions granted.</p>
            <p>But in this new Experiment Mr. <hi>Laws</hi>
found himſelf a little embarraſs'd, for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0040400500:65"/>
there being ſuch a run for their New
Subſcriptions, there were Conſequently
no Buyers, or fewer Buyers than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the Old Stock, every one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as we ſay in <hi>England,</hi> a Penny
for a new Shop; neither was this all,
but as the new Subſcribers paid but 100
Livres down upon their Subſcription,
the reſt being allow'd to be paid in by

               </gap> bought an Old one,
was oblig'd to pay 1000 Livres down,
this carried away the Buyers from the
old Stock; but this likewiſe was not all,
for thoſe who had a mind to ſubſcribe
to the New Stock, on purpoſe to Sell
out again, and Jobb them about, ſold
out the Old Stock, becauſe for two Old
Actions, for which when ſold the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
receiv'd 2000 Livres, he might
with that Money Subſcribe, or buy
Subſcriptions for 20 Shares or Actions
in the New; and laying down the firſt
payment, get to <hi>Quinquampoix ſtreet,</hi>
the Exchange-Alley of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them again at 1100 Livres each,
put 2000 Livres in his Pocket, and be
juſt where he was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0040400500:66"/>
Theſe Things had their Influence
upon the Old Stock, and there being
abundance wanted to Sell, and few to
Buy, the Price fell at once, and indeed
began to fall ſo Conſiderably, that
from 1250 it fell to 760, which was a
threatning Article; but Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> gave
a new Life to it all at once, for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it, and knowing it would run
too faſt for him to ſtop it if it was not
taken in time, applied an immediate
Remedy to it which could not fail to
anſwer his end, this was to publiſh,
and fix it up at the Door of the Bank,
and at other publick places of the City,
That the Company would take in all
the Old Shares that any Man was

Share.</p>
            <p>This was another Teſtimony of the
Maſterly Genius of Mr. <hi>Laws;</hi> for as
ſoon as ever this publication was made
the Old Stock mounted again, and Sold
Currently for 1050 and 1030 or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
no body coming, or but few to
ſell them.</p>
            <p>Thus he warded off the blow: But
this was one Reaſon why he durſt not
venture to form any additional Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
and a good Reaſon too: But
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0040400500:67"/>
from this time forward, the Stock is
Grown up to a Prodigy of 2050 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> It is true it has ſunk a little on
the approach of the time of Payment
for the firſt Three Months, which is to
be paid in the firſt of <hi>January, viz.</hi>
300 Livres <hi>per</hi> Share, and this for want
of Money has ſunk the Stock to about
1850; but Mr. <hi>Law,</hi> that never wants
a Remedy for theſe Diſeaſes, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
calls a meeting of the Directors,
and agrees to declare a Dividend of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to amount to 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon the
Stock, which tho' it be a Trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> on the
preſent advanc'd Price, yet was really
Conſiderable in it ſelf, and amounts to
a very great Sum, no leſs than Six Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
and upwards: However 'tis agreed
that the Company have really gain'd
near 100 Millions Extraordinary, by
ſelling her own Subſcriptions, and buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſelling her own Stock; ſo that
they may very eaſily Divide 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
on the 1ſt Stock, which would have been
1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon the preſent Advance;
but of this hereafter. This is a brief
Account of the prodigious Riſe and
Greatneſs of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Stock, and
of its preſent State and Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0040400500:68"/>
It remains to give ſome account of
its progreſs, and the ſteps Mr. <hi>Law</hi> is
taking to eſtabliſh the Trade which it
has in View; for tho' indeed the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
part has been the leaſt of Mr. <hi>Law</hi>'s
deſign, yet as it is the Denominating
quallity of the Company, and they are
called the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
he puſhes this part alſo.</p>
            <p>The Proceeding of the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi>
part, is partly ſeen in the Arret of the
Council, miſplaced by miſtake, <hi>Pag.</hi> 31,
and which ought to have been placed
here: Wherein the Bank gives, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lends the Company 25 Millions in
Bank-Bills, for ſmall Sums to be Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the Colony of <hi>Louiſania</hi> or
<hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> and partly in the multitude
of People which are every Day all for
Planting ſent thither.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, we find
them launching out into a Prodigious
Trade that way, and ſending out about
Twenty Ships with Soldiers and vaſt
Cargoes, to make Settlements, and place
Factories in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and all the
Twenty Ships to come Home Loden
with things proper for the Trade they
are upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0040400500:69"/>
Theſe are great things it muſt be
confeſt, but as I have ſaid, theſe are
not the chief end in View; Mr. <hi>Law</hi>'s
aims are at Popularity, and keeping up
the Imaginary part which is raiſed to
ſuch a degree, as the Profit of Ten
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trades could not ſupport,
and which never can be ſupported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſomething that can bring in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
equal to 3 or 4 <hi>per Cent per Annum,</hi>
upon the 2000 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which it ſtands
advanc'd.</p>
            <p>To bring this to paſs, we find he does
every thing, and the Government in
his behalf does every thing that can
recommend them to the People, and
particularly acts of Generous Charity,
Publick Spirited Muneficence, taking
off the heavy Taxes upon the ordinary
Neceſſaries of Life and Convenience, by
which the Poor, who are more Senfible
of thoſe things, are touch'd, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to Bleſs both the Perſon and the
Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Innumerable Projects are in his Head
for publick good, he has already cauſed
all the Turnpikes and Tole-bars at the
Entrance into the Streets of <hi>Paris</hi> to be
taken down; an innumerable number
of Collectors and Officers, that teiz'd

Coals or Wood, or Turff to Hay
or Oats, or Straw for Horſes, Fleſh
or Fiſh, Herbs or Garden ſtuff, and
Fruits or Wine to Drink; all things go
free into <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo that the Families
live a fifth part cheaper than they did
before; the very Duty on Fiſh, which
is now aboliſhed, brought in to the
King two Millions a Year; but now
as the Rents of the Town-Houſe of
<hi>Paris</hi> are Reimburſed, and they have
no more Annuities to pay, they have
likewiſe no Taxes to Levy, and all is
made free.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe things, which are the
Conſequence of paying the publick
Debts, he has new Projects of ſo many
kinds, that it would require a large
Book to give an account of them.</p>
            <p>He has undertaken a New Canal,
from the River <hi>Loyer</hi> to the <hi>Seine,</hi> to
bring more Water into the latter, by
the River <hi>Loyng,</hi> and anſwerable to
the Canal <hi>de Briare,</hi> ſo to bring Veſſels
of large Burthens down thoſe Rivers,
and bring Wine and Brandy, and all
bulky Goods quite from <hi>Nants</hi> in <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0040400500:71"/>
and from the Sea, as well as from
the Inland Country about <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has lay'd a Scheme to Reduce the
River <hi>Seine</hi> to a narrower Channel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Roan,</hi> that ſo the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
may be Deepen'd and kept Clear,
by which means Ships of good Burthen
ſhall come up even to <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, and
to <hi>Roan,</hi> Ships of 400 Tuns Burthen
ſhall come freely up to the Town Key.</p>
            <p>He has deſign'd to make <hi>Roan</hi> the
Capital of all <hi>France,</hi> for Commerce,
Navigation and Manufactures, all his
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> Tradede ſhall be
carried on there, and the Magazines,
Warehouſes and places for Publick Sales,
ſhall be fixt and built there; and as the
City of <hi>Roan</hi> itſelf is not ſufficient for
the Number of People that will be
drawn together by theſe things, and by
the Wollen Manufactures and Silk
Manufactures, which he deſigns to
ſettle there, He has projected, as Fame
reports, a New City on the other ſide
the <hi>Seine</hi> over againſt <hi>Roan,</hi> and a
Stone Bridge of a moſt Magnificent
Structure, and which muſt be prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Strong, the Water there being
very deep and Rapid.</p>

This Tract would be far too ſhort to
give a full Scheme, even of this one
deſign, a thing of ſuch a Magnitude
as no Private Man ever undertook, or
any Stock leſs than that of a Prince or
of a Nation accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>But all theſe things ſeem to me to be
rather amuſements to alarm the World,
and make the Company Famous among
Forreigners, than that they are to be
really Executed.</p>
            <p>And they have their end, for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
are amuſed, and all the World
ſeems to be running to <hi>Paris,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Sums Strangers lay out in the
Stock, and the Numbers that come to
Negotiate there, has fill'd <hi>Paris</hi> with
Money and with People, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
with Trade; and they tell us
there is nothing to be ſeen but New
Coaches, New Equipages, New Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and buying New Furniture; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Families having been En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
by this ſurprizing advance of
Stock; in a word, they write from
thence, that there are 1200 New
Coaches ſet up in <hi>Paris,</hi> and half a
Million of People come to the City more
than was there before, ſo that no Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

have given ſome account of the Ebb,

it ſtop'd as above, by the appearance
of an approaching Dividend of Profits;
But this cannot ſupport it long, it muſt
