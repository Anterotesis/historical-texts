            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE inſtitution of <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> in this metropolis for the relief of the <hi>Poor,</hi> afflicted with bodily infirmities, has been, and juſtly too, eſteemed one of the nobleſt of <hi>Charities:</hi> an <hi>Aſylum</hi> this, to ſuccour the diſtreſſed, when their afflictions render them incapable of labouring for their daily ſubſiſtence; where they receive every indulgence their misfortunes can require: the <hi>Sick</hi> being healed, the <hi>Lame</hi> made ſound, and both again rendered fit Members of Society, oftentimes to the joy of a young family opening their mouths for bread, —the fruits of their induſtry. How laudable ſuch inſtitutions!</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations, great muſt be the ſatisfaction of the Benefactors! This is, indeed, in a very eſſential point, acting up to the tenets of the religion we profeſs, and following the example of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour, who went about healing the Sick, and feeding the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are, no doubt, many thouſand objects equally claiming our compaſſion, who, from diſtance of ſituation, are deprived of the relief. It muſt give infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pleaſure to every good Chriſtian, to obſerve ſuch a bleſſing rendered univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal over this iſland.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more practicable.—May we live to ſee ſome humane and public-ſpirited gentleman take it into conſideration, and erect <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> in every county in <hi>England!</hi> Surely no phyſical perſons, from mercenary views, will object to it! for, if they reflect, they can be no loſers in ſuch unhappy patients being taken off their hands, who have not wherewithal to pay them for their trouble.</p>
            <p>It will alſo be the means of having more able practitioners in the country:— A valuable conſequence! And, as goodneſs meets with its own reward, from the experience of thoſe who are appointed to attend the ſick, the <hi>Benefactors</hi> themſelves may receive a <hi>Benefaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome ſea-port towns there are Hoſpitals, and it is with pleaſure to be obſerved that ſome few counties have adopted the plan; but in the more inland parts they are greatly wanted, where the inhabitants, though the moſt laborious, are the moſt indigent; and conſequently, when infirm, true objects of compaſſion.</p>
            <p>Until ſuch time as this meritorious work is become more univerſal, it is preſumed the preſent deſign will prove acceptable to the <hi>Benevolent,</hi> as it, in ſome meaſure, ſupplies the defect; at a trifling expence enabling the wealthy, either for their own amuſement, or by means of a ſervant, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word, <hi>to render Charity to the Needy.</hi>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE intention of the Family Phyſician is, to direct a right uſe of thoſe medicines which are neceſſary to be kept in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, whoſe diſtance from a good practitioner, or any other circumſtance, renders an immediate application in ſudden illneſſes almoſt impoſſible, and occaſions thoſe delays in trifling complaints, which oftentimes prove of very bad conſequence. It has been ſound by experience, for want of proper hints and directions in reſpect to the doſes of medicines, ſeveral fatal errors have been committed; either from the ignorance of perſons themſelves, or from being obliged to have recourſe, for want of better, to quack medicines, or to the advice of nurſes, and ſuch good women, whoſe greateſt ſkill extends to the making a poſſet for a ſweat, or a plaſter for a ſore ſhin.</p>
            <p>Thoſe captains of ſhips whoſe veſſels are too ſmall to allow of carrying a ſurgeon, and gentlemen whoſe buſineſs may call them to take a long voyage in ſuch ſmall veſſels, or to travel by land through unfrequented or poor places, or thoſe who are going to ſettle in any of his Majeſty's plantations, will find a great advantage from being thus enabled, in caſes of neceſſity, to become their own phyſicians; and we often ſee that Nature, with a little aſſiſtance, will free the conſtitution from diſorders which are not too deeply rooted, or very malignant in their firſt attack. I would by no means be underſtood to pretend, that the medicines I here recommend are infallible in the reſpective diſorders they are preſcribed for. They are, for the moſt part, ſuch only as are to be found in the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory of the College of Phyſicians: where I have been under a neceſſity of compounding, I have attended to the practice of the principal phyſicians in town, and my own experience, in ſelecting ſuch medicines whoſe operations are the leaſt dangerous. Thus far, however, I will venture to aſſert, that, by following theſe directions, which are plain and eaſy, and written in a ſtile fitted
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1245100500:4"/>to the meaneſt capacity, <hi>perſpicuity being always preferable to elegance in this kind of writing,</hi> the patient may, by applying what is neceſſary in time, prevent thoſe ills that follow from neglect, which good nurſing and a few innocent things might at firſt remove.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have a knowledge in phyſic, and do not ſtand in need of my aſſiſtance, will, in the cheſts, find many uſeful medicines to be kept at hand; and may extend their practice, by giving me a catalogue of ſuch others as they would chuſe to have added.</p>
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, who reſide in the country, will hereby be enabled to aſſiſt their poor neighbours; which many of them, I doubt not, would take a pleaſure in doing, did they but know what to apply.</p>
            <p>With each cheſt of medicines may be had a box of ſcales and weights; each weight marked diſtinctly, that any perſon may at once adjuſt the proper quantity for a doſe.</p>
            <p>As many perſons may chuſe to keep by them what is proper for their own particular complaints, whom it may not ſuit to have the box complete, I think it neceſſary to mention, that any of the medicines here recommended may be had ſeparately, or as many of them as agreeable, packed up in leſſer boxes for the conveniency of carriage.</p>
            <p>For the ſatisfaction of the public, in order that they may depend upon the medicines, I think it neceſſary to mention that ſuch compoſitions as are not made under my immediate inſpection are prepared at Apothecaries-Hall.</p>
            <p>WEIGHTS uſed in PRESCRIPTION.</p>
            <list>

            <p>Sixteen ounces in meaſure are equal to one pint.</p>
            <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1245100500:5"/>
            <p>The MEDICINE CHESTS <hi>(in Deal)</hi> are ſeven, or eleven guineas;</p>
            <p>The MEDICINE CHESTS <hi>(in Mahogany)</hi> are nine or thirteen guineas; Utenſils included.</p>
            <p>A CHEST may be purchaſed for five guineas; but as the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are upwards of ſixty in number, the quantity of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular article muſt neceſſarily be ſo ſmall, that it does not completely anſwer the purpoſe, and therefore is not recommended. The ſize of the MEDICINE CHEST may be increaſed to any further price, according to the largeneſs of the family, diſtance of place, or extenſiveneſs of the plan for which it is deſigned.</p>
            <p>SMALL CABINETS, very neatly fitted up, and convenient for travelling; complete with medicines, price eight guineas.</p>
            <p>LARGE, ELEGANT CABINETS, forming a handſome piece of furniture for a lady's dreſſing-room at a country-houſe, complete with medicines, price twenty-five guineas.</p>
            <p>The very loweſt prices are fixed, and no orders will be executed but for ready money.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT has been ſuggeſted to the author, that it would be more eligible to print the Family Phyſician in a ſmall pocket-volume, the ſize of his Letters to Married Women, and indeed he had ſome thoughts of ſo printing this edition; but, upon mature deliberation, a <hi>quarto</hi> ſeems beſt calculated to anſwer the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this work.</p>
            <p>The Family Phyſician is ſeldom or never removed from the place where the medicines are kept, which in ſome meaſure obviates the objection to a <hi>quarto</hi> volume: add to this the advantage of a larger margin, which enables the reader to make his own notes and obſervations; and the blank ſheets which are now interleaved will further aſſiſt the laudable deſigns of the intelligent and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent.</p>
            <p>The author received the laſt hint from a perſon of faſhion, who has made a very judicious uſe of blank leaves, by inſerting the hiſtories of remarkable caſes oppoſite to the medicines which effected a cure. Such memorandums may not only prove ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe who take the trouble of making them, but may likewiſe aſſiſt others upon a future occaſion.</p>
            <p>Experience in phyſic is the wiſeſt path to tread; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what poor crazy conſtitutions too many of the human race unhappily ſuſtain, and the various diſorders which even the moſt robuſt are liable to, no one can be too particular in remarking ſuch innocent remedies as may relieve ſlight indiſpoſitions, and conſequently prevent terrible and fatal diſeaſes.</p>

            <p>Good nurſing is a point which has either been too much neglected, or miſtaken; nevertheleſs it is of the firſt conſequence towards the cure of diſeaſes, and the preserving of delicate and feeble conſtitutions.

            <p>The average upon the laſt ten years.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that almoſt two thirds of the children born in this metropolis and its environs are intirely loſt to ſociety: 16283 are, upon the average, the annual births; 10145 the infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burials; and, what deſerves particular attention, 7987 are cut off before they are two years old, which is more than three fourths of thoſe children who die under five years of age. How ardently therefore is it to be wiſhed that ſuch a fatality could be prevented I —it may be prevented.</p>
            <pb n="x" facs="tcp:1245100500:8"/>
            <p>Is it not affecting, that ſo many beings, juſt entering into life, ſhould be ſo untimely cut off, to the detriment of ſociety, and the affliction of their weeping mothers? It is, truly, a ſubject of commiſeration, a ſcene which draws a ſilent tear from the eye of humanity, and pierces the wounded boſoms of afflicted parents.—Above three fourths of theſe little innocents fall a ſacrifice under two years old. It is well known, that the thruſh and watery gripes generally terminate their exiſtence in the early months; and if they ſurvive theſe maladies, the time of teething too frequently brings on a fatal cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>Could we but conquer the prejudices of the times, and aboliſh unnatural and abſurd practices; could we but reſtore that natural and ſimple method of rearing children, which the all-wiſe Giver of life has ſufficiently pointed out; did we but confine them to that nutriment which HE has prepared for their firſt ſtate of exiſtence; and conſult that reaſon which He has beſtowed upon us to conduct them forwards—all would be well. But alas, indolence and luxury forbid the taſk! Nevertheleſs, to the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal few the following remarks are ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>The thruſh and watery gripes are, in the author's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, artificial diſeaſes, and both of them totally occaſioned by improper food; ſuch as all kinds of pap, whether made from flour, bread, or biſcuit: they all cauſe too much fermentation in the ſtomach, and irritate their tender bowels beyond what nature can ſupport. This appears to him to be the evident cauſe of the before-mentioned complaints.</p>
            <p>When infants are paſt this period, the danger in cutting their teeth is juſtly to be feared. This difficulty proceeds altogether from a weakneſs of conſtitution, ariſing from the ſame firſt miſtaken cauſe in point of diet: and here a train of dreadful ſymptoms preſent themſelves; the head, the ſtomach, the bowels, are all at times terribly affected; a general waſting of the body frequently enſues, and unconquerable fevers prevail, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally terminate in convulſions and death.</p>
            <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1245100500:9"/>
            <p>To prevent all theſe unhappy conſequences, let us but for a moment reflect that every mother is deſigned by Nature to foſter her own child. If the breaſt is not to be obtained, cows milk is in general to be preferred<note n="*" place="bottom">For the preſervation of children, the author has cauſed the Milk-pots, which he invented to ſupply the place of the breaſt, to be made in the Queen's ware, in order that the poor, who cannot afford to purchaſe ſilver ones, may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated; and this natural method of feeding infants with milk only will, upon experiment, be found ſo much more convenient to their nurſes, that he hopes to ſee it generally adopted, whereby the lives of thouſands will annually be preſerved.
<p>A piece of fine rag ſhould be tied looſely round the ſpout of the Milk-pot, with which the children will be equally pleaſed as with the nipple of the breaſt itſelf.</p>
               </note> to any kind of ſood that can be invented, becauſe it is nearly ſimilar to that which Nature intended. But it would be ſwelling theſe pages unneceſſarily to enter further upon the management of children, as the treatiſe promiſed in the preface to the laſt edition of this work is now publiſhed under the title of LETTERS TO MARRIED WOMEN, which is intended as a companion for the ſick chamber and the nurſery.</p>
            <p>This book is dedicated to the ladies, as a grateful tribute due to them for their tender care; an humble offering meet to be laid at the feet of thoſe, whoſe compaſſion and delicacy greatly contribute to render the misfortunes of life ſupportable, and whoſe not leaſt endearing province is, where amiable characters may be drawn, the ſick chamber and the nurſery.</p>
            <p>It would be ungrateful in the author not to acknowledge the candour with which the public have been pleaſed to receive that little volume, although it contains ſome doctrines repugnant to the preſent opinions. With a view then to promote the happineſs and comfort of his fellow-creatures, and to preſerve helpleſs infants from their preſent almoſt certain death, he begs leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the peruſal of thoſe Letters to ſuch as are likely to have a young family; and alſo to thoſe whoſe duty may require their
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:1245100500:10"/>attendance in a ſick chamber, and likewiſe to invalids. They will moſt aſſuredly find their account in attending to the maxims there laid down, which are evident to common ſenſe, and the reſult of an aſſiduous attention to the duties of his profeſſion; and it may with truth be added, that they have the further ſanction of many years ſucceſsful experience.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>ON DIET.</head>
               <p>WHEN the phyſician, by means of medicines, has ſubdued a diſeaſe, unleſs the patient is put upon a proper method of diet, exerciſe, &amp;c. to prevent a relapſe, his work is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in vain. A few observations upon food, to enable perſons, in ſome meaſure, to judge for themſelves of the fit or unfit, will, I truſt, prove acceptable; as phyſic and good nurſing ought ever to go hand in hand. My reader will remember I am giving directions to invalids; the glutton will not be ſatisfied with my meal, neither will the epicure reliſh my diſhes. Yet I would wiſh this friendly caution to be attended to even by the vaunters of health; place not too much confidence in the ſuppoſed ſtrength of a good conſtitution, one night's debauch may too late convince you—you are miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Firſt, with reſpect to Vegetables. Thoſe who would wiſh to live free from burning fevers, and eſcape the rage of inflammatory diſorders, particularly if their conſtitutions have been already ſhaken by ſuch complaints, cannot uſe them too plentifully; thoſe whoſe ſtomachs are weakened by diſeaſe, will find the tender vegetable diet frees them from the oppreſſive labour, that ſlted meats require to make them fit for nouriſhment: on the contrary,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1245100500:12"/>where the conſtitution is ſubject to gouty complaints, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly if the ſtomach has been affected by frequent ſpaſms, ſuch perſons muſt be exceedingly cautious in the uſe or vegetables, eſpecially at the time the ſtomach is diſordered. One groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take which we lie under I cannot paſs by unnoticed; I mean the pernicious practice of eating pepper with ſuch food, and it is ſtill worſe if it be not finely powdered, which is generally the caſe; gouty perſons who plead this neceſſity, would do better to avoid vegetables; and the common argument in vindication of its ſuppoſed excellency is, that it prevents vegetables from colick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am well convinced, and ſpeak from experience, that it is often-times the reaſon why vegetables occaſion the colic, which might clearly be demonſtrated: but it is not my buſineſs here to enter into arguments; all that I mean, is to give ſome uſeful hints to thoſe who find it neceſſary to nurſe themſelves, and to correct ſome common errors in our method of living. Thus far I grant, if the man who has been long accuſtomed to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſoned ſoups, rich wines, and cordial liquors, was of a ſudden to change his diet to melons and cucumbers, he would very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly feel ſome diſagreeable effects from it: but even when the appetite has been many years pampered, and the body accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to heating food; yet, by degrees, with a prudent regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſtep by ſtep, the method of living may be again changed to the more wholeſome and cooling diet. This is a piece of advice well worthy of notice, for in many conſtitutional diſorders it is abſolutely neceſſary to be complied with. Do not miſtake me, I am far from thinking it needful for every one who does not boaſt a good ſtate of health to ſubmit himſelf intirely to a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and milk diet; on the contrary, I am truly ſenſible that a moderate uſe of fleſh is far from being unwholeſome; nay, it is even neceſſary for ſome delicate conſtitutions, and for thoſe who uſe much exerciſe, or are required to labour. It is not the prudent uſe, but the abuſe of theſe things I mean to caution you againſt.</p>
               <p>Of vegetables; the turnip, parſnip, potatoe, are very good; fruits, and fruit-pies, ſallads of all kinds, and pot-herbs, are wholeſome; which I would recommend to moſt perſons, and in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1245100500:13"/>a particular manner to the young and growing, and to thoſe who have craving appetites, becauſe ſuch food will prevent them eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too large a quantity of fleſh; and theſe vegetables being eaſy of digeſtion; after a full meal paſs off quickly, and leave the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach more at liberty to exert its force upon that aliment which requires ſo much more time and labour to digeſt.</p>
               <p>I come next to ſpeak of Animal-food. One general rule, which ſeldom ſhould be tranſgreſſed by the infirm, I muſt beg leave to lay down: Never eat fleſh more than once a day, and that at noon. The plain roaſt and boiled, whether butchers meat or poultry, is far preferable to made-diſhes; there is danger to be dreaded, not only from the noxious qualities of the ingredients uſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſuch kitchen poiſons, but alſo from the quantities which are devoured of them; for theſe ſavory ſcents and taſtes ſo quicken the appetite, that people gorge themſelves, and regard not the dictates of nature, ever to be obſerved, and which, if attended to, will always inform us when the ſtomach has received a ſufficient ſupply. Animal-food, which has been any conſiderable time in ſalt, becomes hard, and requires more force to break and digeſt it, proper for nouriſhment, than weak ſtomachs are capable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting; conſequently, ſalted beef, pork, and ſuch-like things, are improper for children, invalids, and aged perſons. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what I have ſaid, ſalt is very wholeſome to be eaten with fleſh; and, in ſome meaſure, neceſſary. The ſtimulus which ſalt gives to the coats of the ſtomach, makes them exert their power with greater force upon the food; and, of courſe, helps digeſtion:—hence, though ſalted meats are improper, it is from the effect which ſalt has upon fleſh that lies long in it; in render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hard, and unfit for nouriſhment; not the ſalt itſelf, that is hurtful. Broths of all kinds, which are not ſeaſoned, are whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; broths contain the juices of the fleſh they are made from, which is the part proper for nouriſhment: —hence, although your made, high-ſeaſoned gravies are to be avoided, thoſe gravies which run out of fleſh upon cutting it after it is brought to table, are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1245100500:14"/>good and nouriſhing, becauſe they are nothing more than the juices of the meat.</p>
               <p>FISH in general are good, particularly ſhell-fiſh; but let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that by ſtewing them with high-ſeaſoned gravies, and ſuch-like arts, they, though innocent in their nature, may be rendered as formidable poiſons as your ragoes, &amp;c.—witneſs the ſacrifices made to health at a turtle-feaſt.</p>
               <p>MILK is a valuable food indeed! this requires little or no labour from the ſtomach; it has already paſſed through ſuch ſtrainers, as render it a kind and wholeſome nouriſhment. This caution I muſt give, becauſe cuſtom has made it almoſt a general practice,—never eat milk with acid fruits—reaſon tells us it is wrong: codlings and milk or cream, ſtrawberries, raſberries, &amp;c. are highly improper to be eaten together; for, by mixing theſe acid fruits with the milk, it is the moſt likely method to make it curdle too haſtily in the ſtomach; of which every one who will give himſelf time to think muſt be convinced. Almoſt all the kitchen preparations of milk are wholeſome, ſuch as cuſtards, white-pots, blamange, &amp;c. Much indeed might be ſaid upon this head; but as it is treated at large in my Letters to Married Women, I ſhall beg leave to refer my readers to them, eſpecially thoſe who are deſirous of knowing the nature and properties of milk, and of underſtanding its ſuperior excellence. It is a nutriment the moſt ſimple, yet the moſt perfect. It requires no labour from the digeſtive faculties, yet fully poſſeſſes every principle of nouriſhment, to give ſtrength to infants, and health to the infirm. Would to God that this natural and ſalubrious diet was more particularly attended to! One thing, however, let me obſerve; a little ſalt being ſprinkled into milk will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prevent its curdling too haſtily upon the ſtomach, where it meets with an acidity, and is particularly to be recommended for children; in general, milk is beſt without boiling; if it purges, it muſt be boiled. You will find an excellent method of uſing it in the directions for giving ſalop in the Family Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1245100500:15"/>
               <p>With reſpect to Liquids.—It would take up too much time to enter upon them here.—We are, however, too fond of acidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated liquors, eſpecially in ſick chambers. The doctrine of acids, in my opinion, has been carried to an extravagant length. I mean to caution the reader againſt too free an uſe of them; and as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diſcuſs this point at preſent, let your own obſervations direct you with regard to your general plan, and abide by ſuch liquors as beſt agree with your conſtitution. I ſhall conclude this head with a few remarks upon eggs.—Eggs are a fine food for weak ſtomachs, but our method of eating them is very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous:—they certainly afford much nouriſhment, and that without labour to the ſtomach; but if they are heated ſo as to ſet the yolk, they will never properly digeſt. Some time ſince I attended a gentleman who was troubled with a vomiting and purging, and notwithſtanding the uſual remedies were applied, the diſorder continued very violent for ten days:—he had taken a gentle puke at the beginning of the complaint; but finding it would not ſubmit to the medicines afterwards given, it plainly appeared to me the cauſe of the diſorder was ſtill in the ſtomach, and ſo it proved; for, upon another vomit being adminiſtered, a large quantity of undigeſted egg came off his ſtomach, which, upon recollection, he remembered to have eaten two days before he was ill, a circumſtance that eſcaped his memory at the time I firſt attended him, and, upon its coming away, the diſorder left him. This remarkable inſtance led me to reflect upon the nature of eggs,—and ever after made me careful, when I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them, to give a ſtrict charge that they were not boiled hard; and, indeed, the method I have found moſt ſucceſsful, where patients have been much emaciated, is the following— Take a new-laid egg, and beat it in a baſon as you would do to make a pudding; then add half a glaſs of madeira, mountain, or mead, to it, and let it be thus taken, with or without a bit of bread; by this means it is rendered palatable, ſits eaſy on the ſtomach, and will ſurely turn to nouriſhment:—ſeveral patients to whom I have recommended eggs, that have not been able to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1245100500:16"/>keep any other nouriſhment, have, in this manner, eaten one, two, and, ſometimes, three eggs in a day, which for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time have been their only ſupport.</p>
               <p>From theſe hints, I think it no difficult matter for thoſe who are in an indifferent ſtate of health to find out a method of diet ſuitable to their own conſtitutions; and it is a juſt obſervation, that every man at the age of forty, with reſpect to himſelf, is either a fool or a phyſician.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1245100500:18"/>ſeldom or never err, by ſuffering the purging, if not over violent, to continue two or three days; at the end of that time, ſhould you find the patient weakened by it, or that it is really a diſorder itſelf, and not a cure for other diſorders, then you may give a doſe or two of rhubarb, and afterwards proceed to the uſe of the electary: by theſe means you will cleanſe the ſtomach and bowels, and get rid of the complaint without any farther trouble.</p>
               <p>Fluxes, which ſea-faring perſons are ſubject to, are to be treated much in the ſame manner; but be very careful to cleanſe the bowels firſt.</p>
               <p>Some of my friends, who have been many years accuſtomed to the ſea, recommend the purging apozem before the uſe of aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents: they ſay it cools the body, and carries off every thing which is diſagreeable to the bowels, better than rhubarb, or any other purge. After having cleanſed the ſtomach and bowels of the filth which occaſioned the diſorder, by the one or other of theſe means, you will find ipecacuanha, given with the aſtringent electary in very ſmall quantities, viz. from half a grain to one or two grains, of infinite ſervice; to which likewiſe a few drops of laudanum may occaſionally be added, but this ſhould be practiſed with caution, and not till the aſtringent electary has been firſt tried; and in deſperate caſes you will have the ſatisfaction to find the method here recommended will ſeldom, if ever, fail of ſucceſs.</p>

               <p>THE febrifuge quality of this bark, and its peculiar efficacy in curing agues<note n="*" place="bottom">Intermittent fevers of every kind, with regard to the intention of cure, muſt be treated in the ſame manner as agues; the cold fit being rather accidental, than eſſential to this diſeaſe.</note> and intermittent fevers, is now univerſally known; yet a too haſty uſe of it oftentimes proves prejudicial, a remittent or continual fever being the conſequence. You will ſeldom or never err, by giving a vomit firſt, and, if the ſick be of a full habit of body, you may alſo purge with ſafety; you will act more prudently by waiting till they have had four or five ague fits before you throw in the bark, giving a ſalt of wormwood draught once in ſix or eight hours, which will make the fits more regular, and prepare the blood for the bark. You ſhould begin when the fever is gone intirely off, and give at leaſt one ounce before you expect it to return<note n="†" place="bottom">In low fenny countries, where the atmoſphere is moiſt and foggy, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary to give one ounce and a half of bark between the fits, but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral an ounce is ſufficient.</note>; half a dram, two ſcruples, or a dram may be given for a doſe, as the ſtomach will bear it; the leſs you adminiſter at a time the more frequently it muſt be repeated; for, unleſs you get the whole quantity down within the time, you do nothing.</p>

               <p>The fit being put by, a ſecond ounce ſhould be taken in the like ſmall doſes within the three following days, at the diſtance of about ſix or eight hours; the patient may now reſt ſix days, unleſs ſigns of the ague's return require the bark to be repeated ſooner, when a third ounce is to be taken in like manner, a doſe every ſix or eight hours; another week being elapſed, a fourth ounce is alſo to be adminiſtered; when you may take your leave of them, and be pretty well aſſured they will not be ſubject to a return.</p>
               <p>The common mixture to give it in, may be made of three quarters of a pint of ſpring water, and a quarter of a pint of good French brandy, ſweetened with a bit of ſugar, a tea-cupful of which ſhould be taken with each doſe; mix the powder in a little of it, and drink the remainder after it.</p>
               <p>If it purges, which is oftentimes the caſe, it ſhould be given in a little cinnamon tea; ſhould not that anſwer, two, three, or four drops of laudanum muſt be added to each doſe.</p>
               <p>If, on the contrary, the bark ſhould bind, a few grains of rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb may be given with each doſe as long as you ſee neceſſary.</p>

Thoſe whom milk is apt to render coſtive, ſhould mix the ſalop with the water alone as above directed, and add the milk to it after it is taken from the fire.</p>

            <p>I RATHER chuſe to mention the complaints in which bleeding is recommended under this general head, than with the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for the reſpective diſorders, becauſe it may naturally be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that aſſiſtance cannot always be procured; for which reaſon, directing to bleed before the uſe of the medicines, in caſes where it might prove ſerviceable, may be a means of preventing the adminiſtering thoſe remedies, which, taken in time, will frequently alone remove the complaints. Beſides, I would not wiſh the unſkilful to be too free with the lancet, as an injudicious evacuation of blood may be ſucceeded with very bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. My intention through the whole, as I obſerved in the preface, being no other than to ſupply families with a few uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remedies for ſlight indiſpoſitions, by which they may frequently prevent tedious illneſſes,—not to put the unexperienced upon trifling with themſelves, or wantonly ſporting with human blood, when patients are really ill, and can have proper advice.</p>
            <p>The beſt authors adviſe blood to be taken away in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of fevers, when there is a ſtrong, quick pulſe, the eyes red and fiery, with great heat and thirſt; but never when they are in the decline, as, from being inflammatory, they are often at this period degenerated into the nervous kind, when the chief of the affair is to be managed by the frequent application of bliſters.</p>
            <p>In aſthmatical complaints, if the patient be of a full habit of body.</p>
            <p>In coughs, if the pulſe is quick and full, with an oppreſſion at the breaſt, or difficulty in breathing.</p>
            <p>In colics, where the pain is violent, the bowels inflamed, and no ſtools.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1245100500:47"/>
            <p>In fits, if the ſpirits are hurried and overpowered, and the patient full of blood.</p>
            <p>In ſwimmings, dizzineſs, and pains of the head.</p>
            <p>In ſtitches, and pleuritic diſorders of the ſide and breaſt, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly if it gives pain to take a deep breath.</p>
            <p>In ſore throats, where there is a ſtrong, quick pulſe, and the throat greatly ſwelled and inflamed.</p>
            <p>For the piles it is ſometimes thought ſerviceable; as likewiſe in female obſtructions, and frequently in rheumatic complaints; in apoplectic diſorders, a dyſentery or bloody-flux, and irkſome heat of the bowels; for the hooping cough, particularly if of a full habit of body, and the phlegm which is brought up appears ſtreaked with blood; in all which caſes, the quantity taken away muſt be proportioned to the age of the patient, and the violence of the complaint.</p>
            <p>Bleeding again is ſometimes directed in large abſceſſes or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, where the heat and pain is immoderate; for, in theſe caſes, by drawing blood, it is ſuppoſed that the matter is more eaſily and ſpeedily brought to ripen, and, by that means, the body more effectually freed from its diſtempers.</p>
            <p>In a word, wherever prevail ſore eyes, ſciatica or hip-gout, a dry huſky cough, an head-ach, pains of the womb or of the bladder, dry gripes, ſtrangury, gravel, pain from the ſtone, violent bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the noſe, ears, or other parts, an inveterate ſcorbutical itch, and the like, opening a vein is eſteemed of peculiar ſervice; but in dropſies, a jaundice, the gout, and all illneſſes occaſioned by a relaxed ſtate of body, an impoveriſhed blood, or too great weakneſs of the veſſels, you muſt ſeek relief from the medicines recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in this little manual, and not, by an abrupt and prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous uſe of bleeding, increaſe the diſorder, and ruin the health of the patient and your own reputation.</p>
            <p>The reader will be pleaſed to underſtand, that what has been ſaid concerning the taking away blood is in conformity to the moſt reſpectable authorities, and the preſent practice. I will now beg leave to add my own opinion, <hi>that it would be happy for mankind if a lancet had never been invented.</hi>

            <head>ON THE APPLICATION OF BLISTERS.</head>
            <p>TO the cautions here laid down, with reſpect to bleeding, I ſhall add a word or two concerning the application of bliſters.</p>
            <p>The moſt excellent remedy may be proſtituted by an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, raſh, and fooliſh practice; which, it is plain, oftentimes happens with regard to bliſters, by ordering them indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in all fevers, and without diſtinction in any time of the diſtemper, which can only be the effect of ignorance.</p>
            <p>Therefore, before we reſolve on an expedient of this nature, it will be convenient to conſider whether the fever be of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory or nervous kind; if of the former, inſtead of bliſtering the lancet is generally uſed, and a mild cooling regimen ſet on foot, as already directed; this will moderate the heat of the blood, and, by degrees, reſtore it to its due temper. On the other hand, in fevers of the nervous claſs, where the ſymptoms are quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the pulſe being low and weak, the ſpirits almoſt ſpent, and the eyes, inſtead of appearing ſparkling, red and fiery, grown quite dim, we ought, by all means, to make uſe of bliſters, and that freely.</p>
            <p>They are oftentimes proper in paralytic and nervous complaints, as likewiſe in rheumatic pains and pleuriſies, in which caſes a bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter applied immediately upon the part affected frequently affords great relief; and in a variety of other caſes they are of infinite ſervice: but then regard muſt be paid to the ſtate of the patient's blood; for, if a full, quick pulſe, great heat, thirſt, and the other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1245100500:49"/>ſymptoms of an inflammatory fever attend upon the diſorders, the fever muſt firſt be conquered, and afterwards, if neceſſity requires it, let bliſters be applied. Should they cauſe a ſtrangury, which will ſometimes be the caſe, give the patient plentifully of marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallow drink, or barley water with a little gum arabic diſſolved in it; or if there is a purging, which you would wiſh to be ſtopped, of the hartſhorn drink; and this inconvenience will ſoon be remedied.</p>
            <p>In regard to the management of bliſters, the plaſter ſhould be ſpread upon a piece of an old glove, and bound on to the part intended; after twenty-four hours, the ſtrength of the flies being pretty well ſpent, you may remove the bliſter, and, if you cannot procure the proper dreſſings, a little Turner's cerate, ſpread upon a piece of fine rag, may ſupply its place.</p>
            <p>Should any bliſters appear unbroken, ſnip them with a pair of ſciſſars; if they give violent pain, this may be done when the plaſter has been applied only twelve hours; when, by diſcharging the water, and laying it ſmoothly on again, you eaſe the patient, and give the bliſter an opportunity of acting more effectually.</p>
            <p>Thus much has been advanced in conformity to the preſent practice, in which I have endeavoured to aſſiſt the intelligent reader, by familiar language, to form clear ideas of the various diſeaſes treated of in this book. The cure of diſeaſes is certainly a laudable and noble ſtudy. It is a ſcience which dignifies human nature: many important truths have been illuſtrated both by the antients, and ſome modern writers—<hi>yet much remains to be known:</hi> which future experience and accurate obſervation may poſſibly diſcover. Permit me to ſay that, in my humble ſtation, I have reaped the advantage of both; and if a diſtant period ſhould afford me leiſure regularly to digeſt my thoughts upon the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intention of diſeaſes, I ſhall not heſitate to promulge doctrines, which are, perhaps, at this time not generally underſtood: and if I continue to be ſo happy as to recommend them by a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practice, I hope to live to ſee my opinions generally adopted by medical practitioners, for the good of this country, and the benefit of the world in general.</p>

               <hi>This Day is alſo Publiſhed, by the ſame</hi> AUTHOR, The THIRD EDITION, Price bound 3 s. 6d. LETTERS TO MARRIED WOMEN, Upon ſeveral important Female Duties, eſpecially thoſe of the Nurſery and Sick Chamber, and concerning aged Parents: The real Benefits of a Milk Diet are demonſtrated, with particular Cautions to Invalids.</head>
            <p>Theſe Letters are principally addreſſed to thoſe Ladies who already have, or are likely to have children, and they will do well to attend to them; as thouſands of little innocents are annually ſacrificed to vulgar errors, which a moment's reflection would explode. Thoſe errors are here expoſed, and a natural and eaſy method of rearing children, approved by experience, is laid down. It neceſſarily follows, that ſuch precautions as are proper for the management of a feeble infant-ſtate, ſhould be equally attended to, when the digeſtive powers are weakened by diſeaſe; and alſo that the ſlow progreſſive ſteps by which we mount into life, are the ſafeſt and beſt paths to deſcend peaceably into the grave.</p>
