            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">WROTE IN THE YEAR MDCCXLIX.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>PRinces, my fair, unfortunately great,</l>
               <l>Born to the pompous vaſſalage of ſtate,</l>
               <l>Whene'er the public calls, are doom'd to fly</l>
               <l>Domeſtic bliſs, and break the private tie.</l>
               <l>Fame pays with empty breath the toils they bear,</l>
               <l>And love's ſoft joys are chang'd for glorious care.</l>
               <l>Yet conſcious virtue, in the ſilent hour,</l>
               <l>Rewards the hero with a nobler dower.</l>
               <l>For this alone I dar'd the roaring ſea,</l>
               <l>Yet more, for this I dar'd to part with thee.</l>
               <l>But while my boſom feels the nobler flame,</l>
               <l>Still unreprov'd, it owns thy gentler claim.</l>
               <l>Tho' virtue's awful form my ſoul approves,</l>
               <l>'Tis thine, thine only, Zara, that it loves.</l>
               <l>A private lot had made the claim but one,</l>
               <l>The prince alone muſt love, for virtue, ſhun.</l>
               <l>Ah! why, diſtinguiſh'd from the happier crowd,</l>
               <l>To me the bliſs of millions diſallow'd?</l>
               <l>Why was I ſingled for imperial ſway,</l>
               <l>Since love and duty point a different way?</l>

               <l>Fix'd the dread voyage, and the day decreed,</l>
               <l>When, duty's victim, love was doom'd to bleed,</l>
               <l>Too well my memory can thoſe ſcenes renew,</l>
               <l>We met to ſigh, to weep our laſt adieu.</l>
               <l>That conſcious palm, beneath whoſe towering ſhade</l>
               <l>So oft our vows of mutual love were made;</l>
               <l>Where hope ſo oft anticipated joy,</l>
               <l>And plann'd of future years the bleſt employ;</l>
               <l>That palm was witneſs to the tears we ſhed,</l>
               <l>When that fond hope, and all thoſe joys were fled.</l>
               <l>Thy trembling lips, with trembling lips, I preſs'd,</l>
               <l>And held thee panting to my panting breaſt.</l>
               <l>Our ſorrow, grown too mighty to ſuſtain,</l>
               <l>Now ſnatch'd us, fainting, from the ſenſe of pain.</l>
               <l>Together ſinking in the trance divine,</l>
               <l>I caught thy fleeting ſoul, and gave thee mine.</l>
               <l>O! bleſt oblivion of tormenting care!</l>
               <l>O! why recall'd to life and to deſpair?</l>
               <l>The dreadful ſummons came, to part—and why?</l>
               <l>Why not the kinder ſummons but to die?</l>
               <l>To die together were to part no more,</l>
               <l>To land in ſafety on ſome peaceful ſhore,</l>
               <l>Where love's the buſineſs of immortal life,</l>
               <l>And happy ſpirits only gueſs at ſtrife.</l>

            <l>IN my dark cell, low proſtrate on the ground,</l>
            <l>Mourning my crimes, thy letter entrance found;</l>
            <l>Too ſoon my ſoul the well-known name confeſt;</l>
            <l>My beating heart ſprung fiercely in my breaſt:</l>
            <l>Thro' my whole frame a guilty tranſport glow'd,</l>
            <l>And ſtreaming torrents from my eyes faſt flow'd.</l>
            <l>O Eloiſa! art thou ſtill the ſame?</l>
            <l>Doſt thou ſtill nouriſh this deſtructive flame?</l>
            <l>Have not the gentle rules of peace and heaven</l>
            <l>From thy ſoft ſoul this fatal paſſion driven?</l>
            <l>Alas! I thought thee diſengag'd and free;</l>
            <l>And can'ſt thou ſtill, ſtill ſigh and weep for me?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0579800304:30"/>What powerful deity, what hallow'd ſhrine,</l>
            <l>Can ſave me from a love and faith like thine?</l>
            <l>Where ſhall I fly, when not this awful cave,</l>
            <l>Whoſe rugged feet the ſurging billows lave;</l>
            <l>When not theſe gloomy cloiſter's ſolemn walls,</l>
            <l>O'er whoſe rough ſides the languid ivy crawls;</l>
            <l>When my dread vows in vain their force oppoſe,</l>
            <l>Oppos'd to love—alas! how vain are vows!</l>
            <l>In fruitleſs penitence I wear away</l>
            <l>Each tedious night; each ſad revolving day</l>
            <l>I faſt, I pray; and, with deceitful art,</l>
            <l>Veil thy dear image from my tortur'd heart:</l>
            <l>My tortur'd heart conflicting paſſions move,</l>
            <l>I hope, deſpair, repent—yet ſtill I love.</l>
            <l>A thouſand jarring thoughts my boſom tear,</l>
            <l>For thou, not God, O Eloiſe art there.</l>
            <l>To the falſe world's deluding pleaſures dead,</l>
            <l>Nor longer by its wandering fires miſled,</l>
            <l>In learn'd diſputes harſh precepts I infuſe,</l>
            <l>And give that counſel I want power to uſe.</l>
            <l>The rigid maxims of the grave and wiſe</l>
            <l>Have quench'd each milder ſparkle of my eyes;</l>
            <l>Each lovely feature of this well-known face,</l>
            <l>By grief revers'd, aſſumes a ſterner grace.</l>
            <l>O Eloiſa! ſhould the fates once more,</l>
            <l>Indulgent to my view, thy charms reſtore!</l>
            <l>How wouldſt thou from my arms with horror ſtart,</l>

            <l>Lean abſtinence, pale grief, and haggard care,</l>
            <l>The dire attendants of forlorn deſpair,</l>
            <l>Have Abelard the young, the gay, remov'd,</l>

            <l>And torn from all my ſoul held dear in thee.</l>
            <l>Ambition, with its train of frailties gone,</l>

            <l>O vows! O convents! your ſtern force impart,</l>

            <l>Let other ſighs a worthier ſorrow ſhow;</l>
            <l>Let other tears, for ſin, repentant flow:</l>

            <l>Who thro' this trembling, this offending frame,</l>

            <l>There died the generous fire, whoſe vigorous flame</l>

            <head>ABELARD TO ELOISA.</head>
            <byline>BY THE LATE MR. CAWTHORNE, MASTER OF TUNBRIDGE-SCHOOL.</byline>
            <argument>
               <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>Abelard and Eloiſa flouriſhed in the twelfth century: they were two of the moſt diſtinguiſhed perſons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate paſſion. After a long courſe of calamities, they retired each to a ſeveral convent, and conſecrated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this ſeparation, that a letter of Abelard's to a friend, which contained the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of his misfortunes, fell into the hands of Eloiſa: this occaſioned thoſe celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly extracted), which give ſo lively a picture of the ſtruggles of grace and nature, virtue and paſſion.</p>
               <p>MR. POPE.</p>
            </argument>
            <lg>
               <l>AH, why this boding ſtart? this ſudden pain,</l>
               <l>That wings my pulſe, and ſhoots from vein to vein?</l>
               <l>What mean, regardleſs of yon midnight bell,</l>
               <l>Theſe earth-born viſions ſaddening o'er my cell?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0579800304:50"/>What ſtrange diſorder prompts theſe thoughts to glow?</l>
               <l>Theſe ſighs to murmur, and theſe tears to flow?</l>
               <l>'Tis ſhe, 'tis Eloiſa's form reſtor'd,</l>
               <l>Once a pure ſaint, and more than ſaints ador'd:</l>
               <l>She comes in all her killing charms confeſt,</l>
               <l>Glares thro' the gloom, and pours upon my breaſt,</l>
               <l>Bid heaven's bright guard from Paraclete remove,</l>
               <l>And drags me back to miſery and love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Enjoy thy triumphs, dear illuſion! ſee</l>

               <l>See, at thy call, my guilty warmths return,</l>
               <l>Flame thro' my blood, and ſteal me from my urn.</l>
               <l>Yet, yet, frail Abelard! one effort try,</l>
               <l>Ere the laſt lingering ſpark of virtue die;</l>
               <l>The deadly charming ſorcereſs controul,</l>
               <l>And ſpite of nature tear her from thy ſoul.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long has that ſoul in theſe unſocial woods,</l>
               <l>Where anguiſh muſes, and where horror broods,</l>
               <l>From love's wild viſionary wiſhes ſtray'd,</l>
               <l>And ſought to loſe thy beauties in the ſhade,</l>
               <l>Faith dropt a ſmile, devotion lent her fire,</l>
               <l>Woke the keen pang, and ſanctified deſire;</l>

               <l>And taught my heart to glow with all its God.</l>
               <l>But oh, how weak fair faith and virtue prove!</l>
               <l>When Eloiſa melts away in love!</l>

               <l>In rank ſuperior to our boaſted race,</l>
               <l>Subaltern gods, now ſeldom ſeen, had place:</l>
               <l>Immortal theſe, but of a doubtful birth,</l>
               <l>And all with man joint ſojourners on earth.</l>
               <l>Sacred, to ſome bright nymph, was every tree,</l>

               <l>Tho' ſorrow may blemiſh the verſe,</l>
               <l>Yet let the ſad tribute be paid.</l>
               <l>They call'd him the pride of the plain:</l>
               <l>In ſooth he was gentle and kind;</l>
               <l>He mark'd in his elegant ſtrain</l>

               <l>He cultur'd his thyme for the bees;</l>
               <l>But never once rifled their cell.</l>
               <l>Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet,</l>

               <l>His Phillis was proud of his praiſe,</l>
               <l>And poets came round in a throng;</l>

               <l>YE foplings, and prigs, and ye wou'd-be-ſmart things,</l>
               <l>Who move in wide commerce's round,</l>
               <l>Pray tell me from whence this abſurdity ſprings,</l>
               <l>All orders of rank to confound.</l>
               <l>What means the bag-wig, and the ſoldier-like air,</l>
               <l>On the tradeſman obſequious and meek?</l>
               <l>Sure ſabbaths were meant for retirement and prayer</l>
               <l>To amend the paſt faults of the week.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The youth, to whom battles and dangers belong,</l>
               <l>May call a fierce look to his aid;</l>
               <l>Lace, bluſter, and oaths, and a ſword an ell long,</l>
               <l>Are ſamples he gives of his trade;</l>
               <l>But you on whom London indulgently ſmiles,</l>
               <l>And whom counters ſhould guard from all ills,</l>
               <l>Should ſlily invade with humility's wiles,</l>
               <l>Leſt ſplendor deter us from bills.</l>

               <l>HAil noble Critic! whoſe pervading mind</l>

            <head>PROLOGUE TO THE GRATEFUL FAIR, A COMEDY INTENDED FOR THE STAGE.</head>
            <byline>BY MR. SMART.</byline>
            <l>IN antient days (as jovial Horace ſings)</l>
            <l>When laurell'd bards were lawgivers and kings,</l>
            <l>Bold was the comic muſe, without reſtraint,</l>
            <l>To name the vicious, and the vice to paint;</l>
            <l>Th' enliven'd picture from the canvas flew,</l>
            <l>And the ſtrong likeneſs crouded on the view.</l>
            <l>Our author practiſes more general rules,</l>
            <l>He is no niggard of his knaves and fools:</l>
            <l>Both ſmall and great, both dull and pert he ſhews,</l>
            <l>That every gentleman may pick and chuſe.</l>
            <l>The laws dramatic tho' he ſcarcely knows</l>
            <l>Of time and place, and all the piteous proſe,</l>
            <l>Which pedant Frenchmen ſnuffle thro' their noſe.</l>
            <l>Fools!—who preſcribe what Homer ſhould have done,</l>
            <l>Like tattling watches they correct the ſun.</l>
            <l>Critics—like poſts—undoubtedly may ſhow</l>
            <l>The way to Pindus—but they cannot go.</l>
            <l>For to delight and elevate the mind,</l>
            <l>To heaven-directed genius is aſſign'd.</l>
            <l>When-e'er immortal Shakeſpear's works we read,</l>
            <l>He wins the heart, before he ſtrikes the head.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0579800304:124"/>Swift to the ſoul the piercing image flies</l>
            <l>More ſwift than Celia's wit, or Celia's eyes,</l>
            <l>More ſwift than ſome romantic traveller's thought,</l>
            <l>More ſwift than Britiſh fire, when William fought.</l>
            <l>Fancy precedes and conquers all the mind,</l>
            <l>Deliberating judgment ſlowly lags behind,</l>
            <l>Comes to the field with blunderbuſs and gun,</l>
            <l>Like heavy Falſtaff, when the work is done,</l>
            <l>Fights, when the battle's o'er, with wondrous pain</l>
            <l>By Shrewſbury clock—and nobly ſlays the ſlain.</l>
            <l>But critic cenſures are beneath his care,</l>
            <l>Who ſtrives to pleaſe the honeſt and the fair:</l>
            <l>Their approbation is much more than fame,</l>
            <l>He ſpeaks—he writes—he breathes not—but for them.</l>

            <l>THE race of critics, till of late, were grac'd</l>
            <l>With reading, learning, judgment, ſenſe, and taſte:</l>
            <l>And none e'er dar'd uſurp that noble name,</l>
            <l>But who, as authors, had eſtabliſh'd fame;</l>
            <l>By envy never, nor by ſpite miſled,</l>
            <l>And, tho' ſtrict judges, they were ſtill well-bred:</l>
            <l>But now, oh ſhame to Britain, and the muſe!</l>
            <l>Dame Griffiths writes her infamous Reviews,</l>
            <l>Who to no requiſite can make pretence</l>
            <l>Of learning, genius, judgment, taſte, or ſenſe;</l>
            <l>Yet with the rancour of a curſed elf,</l>
            <l>She damns all works—but what ſhe prints herſelf:</l>
            <l>Thus modern Methodiſts, with fooliſh pride,</l>
            <l>Save their own ſect, and deem all damn'd beſide;</l>
            <l>To cobler-parſons weaver-prieſts ſucceed,</l>
            <l>And preach that Goſpel which they cannot read.</l>
