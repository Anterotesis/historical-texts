            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO thoſe who are not converſant in the hiſtory of the Aſiatic nations, it may not be improper to give in brief, the ſtory upon which the Tragedy of Zingis is founded, as it is taken from the TARICH MOGULISTAN, or Hiſtory of the Mogul Tartars, written in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian language.</p>
            <p>In the twelfth century, moſt of the Tartar Ordas, or tribes, though governed by their own chiefs, paid tribute to the king of the Orda of the Keraits, who held his court under the title of the GRAND CHAN, in the city of Caracorum, well known ſince by the name of Orda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balich. The famous Zingis Chan, who afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all the countries from the ſea of Canton in China to the Nile, was prince of the Niron tribe of Tartars; and from his early youth, ſerved in the armies of Aunac, the Grand Chan; and at laſt roſe to the command of all his forces. Zemouca, chief of the Siogarates, ſupplanted Zingis in Aunac's favor. Zingis was diſgraced. He retired to his Orda, which was in ſome meaſure indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Grand Chan. Aunac purſued Zingis with a ſmall force, and was defeated. In the enſuing year Aunac was, in a pitched battle, totally routed by Zingis; Zangon the prince royal was ſlain, and the only daughter of Aunac, Oviſa Lugîn, fell into the conqueror's hands. Zingis having determined to give Oviſa in marriage to his favorite ſon Octar, who afterwards ſucceeded him in the empire of all Aſia, occaſioned an inſurrection under Timur, another of his ſons, who was in love with the princeſs. Timur fell in his rebellion, Oviſa died of grief, and the unfortunate monarch, Aunac, was killed in his flight, from an action, in which he was defeated by a part of the army of Zingis.</p>
            <p>Zingis Chan, whether we regard him as a conqueror or legiſlator, was, perhaps, the greateſt prince, that ever appeared in hiſtory. He not only ſecured the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of all Aſia to his poſterity for ſome ages, but even to
<pb facs="tcp:0152601600:4"/>
this day, two-thirds of that immenſe continent remains in the poſſeſſion of princes of his blood. So fortunate was he in his children and deſcendents, that many of them did not yield in abilities to him; and they would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have equalled him in fame, had his ſword left them more to conquer.—The Emperor of China, the Mogul of India, the great Chan of Tartary, and the princes of the Krim Tartars, derive their blood from Zingis; and it is remarkable that, at one period, there were five hundred crowned heads of his race in Aſia.</p>

            <l>Will you, ye Criticks, give up Rome and Greece?</l>
            <l>And turn Mahometans, and ſave this Piece?</l>
            <l>What, ſhall our ſtage receive this Tartar race,</l>
            <l>Each whiſker'd hero with a copper face?</l>
            <l>I hate the Tartars,—hate their vile religion,—</l>
            <l>We have no ſouls forſooth—that's their deciſion!</l>

            </l>
            <l>Romans and Greeks for me!—O that dear Sparta!</l>
            <l>Their women had a noble Magna Charta!</l>
            <l>There a young hero, had he won fair fame,</l>
            <l>Might from her huſband, aſk a lovely dame;</l>
            <l>The happy huſband of the honour vain,</l>
            <l>Gave her with joy, took her with joy again;</l>

And to their honour, all hiſtorians ſay,</l>
            <l>No Spartan lady, ever ſinn'd that way.—</l>
            <l>Ye Fair, who have not yet thrown out your bait,</l>

            <l>Let hand in hand with prudence go your wiſhes,</l>
            <l>Men are in general, the ſtrangeſt fiſhes!</l>
            <l>Do not for miſery your beauty barter,</l>
