            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE ardour of your ſentiments, ſir, becomes your age, and I am pleaſed with your compliment, becauſe I perceive it is the efferveſence of a ſincere heart—I was going to ſay, that if—but we will proceed to our more familiar illuſtrations!—Imagine that when theſe children were five weeks old, the mother of the pooreſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extreme neceſſity, puts her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0686100202:3"/>in a baſket, and lays it at the door of a perſon equally celebrated for wealth and benevolence—the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man takes it into his houſe, clothes, feeds, and educates it as his own —that very infant which with the <hi>parent</hi> would be the lout I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, would with its <hi>protector</hi> be as different a creature as could exiſt. His pains, paſſions, pleaſures, and ideas, totally <hi>reverſed</hi>—imagine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that ſome gypſey ſteals, or kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naps, as it is called, the rich child from the cradle, and ſtrolls with it up and down the country: it will have its education in the open air, its lodging in a barn, and its dirty diet under a hedge. Probably it will imbibe the craft and ſubtlety of the gypſey, and limit its utmoſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0686100202:4"/>ambition to trick the traveller out of ſixpence, croſs the palm with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and tell the events which <hi>have</hi> happened (or are ſtill to be brought forward) by the <hi>line of life.</hi> Thus, in every other inſtance, (with a few peculiar exceptions, that have nothing to do with general rules,) <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>education</hi> form the mind, and colour the human character.—</p>
                  <p>But how does this influence, what we call virtue and vice? ſaid I—Virtue and vice, (rejoin'd the gentleman,) are as dependent upon external as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumſtances: they are properties not more hereditary than adventitious and artificial: nor do they iſſue more from the heart than from habit.—You aſtoniſh me, I replied.—You are now, (cried he,) at the period of human life,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0686100202:5"/>when curioſity is <hi>often</hi> caught in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes. Experience will teach you to hear what now ſeems ſtrange, without emotion I have ſaid nothing but what will too ſoon be intelligible.—</p>

                  <p>—There are, doubtleſs—reſumed the gentleman — ſome conſtitutions ſo adapted by nature to virtue, that no troubles, ſituations, or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, can ſubdue, or extirpate, their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable propenſities—but <hi>ninety-nine</hi> times out of a <hi>hundred,</hi> a character takes its bias and bearing from mere tuition, and the line it is either led or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0686100202:6"/>thrown into, in the firſt ſtage of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man journey. If there are <hi>no</hi> innate ideas, ſir, it follows that the mind of every new-born babe is equally pure —If there <hi>are</hi> thoſe infantine ſeeds of the underſtanding and little embrios of intellect—they are eaſily turned into what channel the parent thinks proper —ſo that I cannot but think the father of a family one of the moſt aweful charges upon earth:
<q>
                        <l>——— our parent's hand</l>
                        <l>Writes on our hearts the firſt faint characters,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>After which,
<q>Nothing can efface them, but death or heaven.</q>
Yet we behold ſaid I, many children unlike their parents, both good and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0686100202:7"/>bad. It is admitted, ſaid Mr. Greaves: yet you will, at the ſame time, obſerve, where the notions of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children are diſſimilar, the diſſimilitude ariſes rather from difference of ages, or improper cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than any thing elſe; in general children are not liker in features than habits, and I do aſſure you family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <hi>minds</hi> are as often tranſmitted as family-<hi>faces.</hi> There is a tractabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in youth which receives like ſnow, every impreſſion—and it is almoſt as difficult to eraſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of one as the other: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but heaven can effect it.—If a ſon is trained up early to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of manners, and has the example of dignity living and moving before his eyes (unleſs his temper is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0686100202:8"/>particularly untoward) he will turn out an elegant character—If he is trained up in different principles, he will act accordingly.—The Hoyden and the Prude, amongſt the other ſex, take not their tint of character one time in ten from nature, but from a neglect early to give them a proper idea of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. But yet, ſaid I, very ſedate women have romping, runaway daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and very prudent fathers have very perverſe ſons.—I mean, (replied Mr. Greaves,) to ſay no more than this, that, generally ſpeaking, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men act and think as they are taught whilſt they are only able to liſp out their meaning—that education will have ſome influence on the moſt abandoned; and that, upon the whole, virtue and vice depend very eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0686100202:9"/>on our primary ſentiments and examples; which, whether good or ill, will externally attend us in ſome meaſure, through all poſſible tranſitions from the time we leave our cradles, to the time we ſhall be depoſited in our coffins—If I have not wearied you, we will <hi>now</hi> ſee how far habit, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences our judgments in the great and important article of <hi>reputation.</hi>

                  <p>I liſten to you, ſir, (ſaid I) with joy, and only lament that I am contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your fatigue, at the time that I am receiving ſuch a fund of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0686100202:10"/>—Habit, my young friend, ſaid the gentleman, operates with equal energy upon man and beaſt. I could eaſily produce evidences of the fact, by caſting an eye upon the very horſes now engaged in the dutiful drudgery of dragging us along, and upon the herds and flocks which are grazing or ſporting beſide us: but we will confine ourſelves to our own ſpecies, which are certainly the moſt intereſting objects of ſpeculation. I was about to obſerve, that Cuſtom has much to do with our moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. There are certain actions, ſo naturally and palpably, good, or evil, that neither ſophiſtry, nor ſlander, nor addreſs, can either injure, mend, or mar them. To queſtion the light at noon day, or the dark in the zenith
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0686100202:11"/>of the night, would argue a mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beyond madneſs: ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to diſpute, whether downright wickedneſs <hi>is</hi> wickedneſs, and evident excellence <hi>is</hi> excellence, would be a lunacy in ethics, ſo abſurd, that the poetical frenzy of poor Lee would be cool argument to it—on the other hand, my good ſir, if you live and mix long with mankind, you will find many of your fellow-creatures, pining away exiſtence under the laſhes,— the bleeding laſhes of reproach, merely becauſe it is the <hi>cuſtom</hi> to call one thing right and another wrong, without trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to the bottom. It is a maxim that the Vox Populi, is the Vox Dei —that (as you know it is tranſlated) "what every body ſays muſt be true." I know nothing ſo deſerving refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0686100202:12"/>as a collection of thoſe old ſaws and proverbs, which, acquiring force from antiquity, and eſtimation from ruſt—for there are virtuoſos in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well as in coins—are at length conſidered as utterly inconteſtible. Now, certain I am, that upon an examination into thoſe very maxims we put ſo much credit in, ſome will turn out futile, ſome diſputable, and many unfaithful—for minute ſcrutinies we have not time: it will be ſufficient to look into <hi>that</hi> I have juſt mentioned, and there is none more implicitly believed. "What every body ſays muſt be true"—I have myſelf ſeen many inſtances to diſprove this; but I ſhall beg your acceptance of one which is now uppermoſt in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.—A young gentleman of my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0686100202:13"/>particular acquaintance, has for ſome time been deſerted by his old compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and branded as a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady principles, whoſe heart I know to abound with all thoſe ſenſibilities which have hurried him as it were into the vortex of liberality, till he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an object of liberality himſelf. He has thoſe glowing feelings, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, which do at once honour and ſervice, to human-nature: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, like poor Mr. Blewitt (whoſe hiſtory was recited by the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer) embarraſſments have beſet him, and the world ſets him down an <hi>undone</hi> man. The world gets hold of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and then it is called Vox Dei. The Vox Populi, is given as the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of <hi>every-body,</hi> and thus many reputations are miſtaken and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, which deſerve a better fate.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0686100202:14"/>There are various perſons likewiſe now particularly reprobated for a few indelicate conceſſions, to which neceſſity may, in violence of their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgments, have conſtrained them to yield, who (had they poſſeſſed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier circumſtances) would have made a much more reſpectable figure than thoſe which now mark them with inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Many an unfortunate female too, at this time wandering up and down the ſtreets—many an inſulted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving character—But I am rambling too miſcellaneouſly—I feel myſelf a little weary—Heigho—</p>
                  <p>Here the gentleman ſtoped abruptly —His countenance became ſuddenly clouded—his lip quivered—his eye remained fixed; and claſping his hands forcibly together, he at length burſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0686100202:15"/>into tears—After he a little recovered himſelf—he caught me hold by the arm, and exclaimed—Oh! ſir—my daughter! my daughter!—my Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria!</p>

                  <p>I am now compoſed, my young friend —the idea of a domeſtic misfortune obtruded itſelf upon me, and I could not help feeling the ſtroke of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity—of nature, and a father—Heaven! cried I,—you diſtract me. I was about to take notice, replied Mr. Greaves—of <hi>one</hi> cruelty in the Vox Populi, which is certainly againſt every notion of the Vox Dei. 'Tis the cuſtom, ſir, to abandon the weakeſt part of our ſpecies, for <hi>that</hi> ruin which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0686100202:16"/>the artifices of our ſex have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated; nor can any future repentence remove the ſenſe of their error, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to the boſoms of more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate women:
<q>They ſet like ſtars to riſe no more.—</q>
I had a wife, ſir, with whom I have mourned many years,—though I bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her but ſix weeks ago—She died of a broken heart, and there was, I aſſure you,—a woe in the family big enough to break it.—About eleven years ago, ſir, an only child was taken from me—I was robbed of her by a man whom I held the neareſt to my heart—and for five years it has been my inceſſant buſineſs to recover my darling, but in vain. My wife fell into a deep and rapid conſumption,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0686100202:17"/>and I was obliged to reſide with her in the country—She grew worſe and weaker every hour—but two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe reſigned her laſt breath—we received (by a ſpecial meſſenger) a packet—how ſhall I ſpeak it—from— from my beloved—miſguided—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting wanderer!—The poor thing had (the better to perſuade) thrown the pathetic parts of her ſtory into poetry. —But that which delighted me more— far more—than all the reſt—and which would have more magic for a parent's heart, than the poetry of a Milton— was an atteſted account from a man of reputation, that my child was actually at laſt under the protection of that noble inſtitution which offers an aſylum to inſulted penitence.—In the firſt tranſport, I could not conceal the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0686100202:18"/>news from my wife, but ſhe had only power to preſs the paper, trembling to her boſom, and feebly lifted up her eyes to heaven—the reſt—you muſt ſpare me, ſir, upon the tender ſubject —ſhe is dead!—ſhe is in heaven!—</p>
                  <p>The poor gentleman covered his face in his hankerchief, and I have no words to deſcribe my own feelings—</p>

                  <p>—When Mr. Greaves could again lift up his head—he told me, that having truſted to the ground the remains of his wife, he was now going to viſit his long-loſt daughter, who was in —he ſtopt—and I was unwilling to enlarge upon the ſubject, though I

At laſt, however, Mr. Greaves perceiving my anxiety, and gueſſing the cauſe, put his hand into his pocket, and produced a ſmall bundle of papers, faſtened by a piece of red tape—from theſe he took a manuſcript, of which he thus declared his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he held it in his hand.</p>

                  <p>Before I proceed to ſet down other matters which fell out to chequer the adventures of my journey, I cannot but obſerve that about two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this period I met Mr. Greaves in the Park, with a beautiful young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under his arm; and ſome time afterwards I paid him a viſit, when he took me cordially by the hand, and ſpoke to me as follows.</p>
                  <p>My dear BENIGNUS, where have you been buried ſince our laſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view? When I told you upon the road the occaſion of that melancholy you detected through my efforts to conceal it, you may remember I told you the motive of my journey. Upon my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0686100202:49"/>in London, and taking leave of you, I call'd an hackney coach, and drove directly to ***—In one word— I found my <hi>daughter.</hi>—I felt the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penitent in my arms. I received of her with an anxiety of joy—a tremor tranſport—Oh! BENIGNUS, think for me—colour the ſcene in the paint of youthful ardour—do juſtice to nature, and <hi>imagine</hi> the delicacies which were never <hi>ſpoken.</hi> You have ſeen my daughter—I never walk without her —and yet, ſir, all this joy is daſhed with an ingredient of ſorrow. The prudes (untouched by the pathos of her penitence) carry an air of ceremonious civility towards my child.—The faded virgins who have never paſſed the fiery trial of temptation, and a ſet of haughty matrons, who have every
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0686100202:50"/>other vice that diſgraces the ſex, but that of which even nature <hi>predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> they ſhould never be guilty— treat my Almeria with a coy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting reſerve, which goes too near her heart—an heart, BENIGNUS, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and gentle as—</p>
                  <p>Here our diſcourſe was interrupted by ALMERIA herſelf, who came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us the chocolate waited for us in the little ſaloon.
<q>
                        <l>—Grace was in all her ſteps,</l>
                        <l>In every action, dignity and love.</l>
                     </q>
Her own epiſtle has ſo pathetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the miſery of her ſituation, that ſhe has not left room for any thing but pity.—And yet who that conſiders ſuch a creature has been, as it were, <hi>public property</hi>—that reflects,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0686100202:51"/>how many are at this very moment chained down to a neceſſity equally ſore; many of them expoſed to the want of that daily bread, which even nightly impurity cannot ſupply— ſome of them beating through the ſtreets by the barbarity of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer—ſome hunted from one hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place to another, by the vigilance of the bailiff; and all of them liable to contempt, indignity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper—who, I ſay, that collects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether theſe facts in his mind, can be content with expreſſing barren com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion?—Who can forbear mixing relief with their tears, and bleſſing the benevolence which firſt ſuggeſted, and ſtill continues, their <hi>Aſylum.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>I have a little violated chronology, by placing theſe tranſactions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0686100202:52"/>out of the order of time, but as my hiſtory is written at a venture, and may never viſit the world, I have been leſs cautious of obſerving critical rules. However, as I by no means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make a book of digreſſions, I ſhall now turn back to Mr. Greaves, who having ſat with his eyes cloſed, was, when he opened them again, much more fitted for ſociety. There are, in truth, certain moments when the muſic of the <hi>ſpheres</hi> would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant, and when the condolence of our deareſt acquaintances is an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come interruption. The human ſoul ſettles on her darling ſubject, deſcends into herſelf, and indulges in a luxury, which, bee like, extracts honey from the poiſon of calamity. In one of theſe diſpoſitions was Mr. Greaves,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0686100202:53"/>when he counterfeited repoſe: he had now reconciled himſelf to the events he had contemplated, (for he was both a philoſopher and a chriſtian) and with an affability peculiar to well-bred people, begged my pardon for his reveries.</p>

                  <p>We were now juſt ſtepping into our laſt ſtage but one, and though the glories of the ſun were over, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting beams were extremely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Mr. Greaves reſumed a look of complacency, and I being willing to keep as clear of the only ſubject that could perhaps again diſcompoſe it, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what ſort of ſenſations were created
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0686100202:54"/>in his mind by the ſtory of Mr. Blewitt. Though his hiſtory was related (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my companion) in unpoliſhed language, it contains a folio of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable facts. But what a pity it is, repeated I, that ſuch mercenary hearts as are lodged in the boſoms of the Quaker and Grocer, ſhould be, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, more undiſturbed through life, than ſuch as guided the feelings of the generous Mr. Blewitt. Alas! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the gentleman, you are yet an infant in terreſtial events. I dare ſwear you have an excellent heart, and I am ſure a good underſtanding, yet you know but little of life.—You profeſs to be travelling in purſuit of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and to dedicate your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to the ſervice of ſociety. From hence I ſhould conclude that you are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0686100202:55"/>flying from <hi>miſery.</hi> I related my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures at the village. He ſaid if I could not find Contentment in the ſhade, it was doubtful whether I ſhould meet her in the city. But I fear, continued he, you expect from the world more than it can beſtow; you have, perhaps, placed the ſtandard of felicity too high, or your ideas of it are probably a little romantic.</p>
                  <p>All I want upon earth, replied I, is comprized in three things, friendſhip, fidelity, and gratitude.—At your age, reſumed Mr. Greaves, (ſmiling,) I entered the world, animated by the ſame hopes, and faſcinated by the ſame notions. My head—my hands, and my heart, were buſy to derive a reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bleſſing to <hi>myſelf,</hi> by having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the bleſſedneſs of <hi>others.</hi> To
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0686100202:56"/>this end I continued in the world till that agonizing accident I have already related.—</p>
                  <p>At this criſis our chaiſe having juſt aſcended a hill arrived at a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſpot indeed. It was an eminence that topt an extenſive proſpect, and commanded the ſcene below, which was compoſed of <hi>intermingled</hi> towers, and ſpires, woods and waters, the verdure of fields, and the variegation of vallies—I could not help ejaculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome energy—Is it not ſtrange that a world like this, ſo fitted for the reception and happineſs of every being which inhabits it, with ſuch noble capacities of pleaſure adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each, ſhould nevertheleſs be the ſeat of general torment and fretfulneſs, diſaſter and diſtreſs.—Is it not ſtrange that—that—</p>

                  <p>Never allow amazement to hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you into expreſſions unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the character of a chriſtian; nor let either the inſults or miſeries you ſee or feel in the world, make you charge Heaven with the ſhadow of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. Take my word for it, God is not, nor ever was in fault—You ſee before you, this moment, enough to convince you, that he has done every thing on his part—the ſun warms us —the moon in his abſence ſets off the

MAN has perverted the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem—the invention of coins, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for negotiation, and the love of barter have extended an ambition of the loweſt kind amongſt all claſſes of people. The motive of commerce is no longer rational; and buſineſs, which was originally deſigned to promote health, and circulate interchanged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, is now for the moſt part ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riciouſly carried on, to ſwell the coffers of the individual by impoveriſhing the ſpecies; nay, the mercenary ſpirit of the times extends to nations and climates divided by the remoteſt part of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0686100202:59"/>ocean. But if you pleaſe we will trace this evil <hi>ab origine.</hi> The Almighty cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a world, then peopled it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found that it was <hi>good.</hi> The management of it was put into the hands of man—not, however, to be too minute, let us take notice, that every thing was once indiſcriminately enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The earth was a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and it was fertile without labour—the error of our firſt parents conſiderably changed the ſyſtem, and tillage and druggery became neceſſary to ſubdue a ſoil, that no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced plenty ſpontaneouſly. No abſolute right however or proprietor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was yet aſcertained, and every one fixed on, and cultivated the ſpot he choſe: this <hi>miſcellaneous</hi> participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoon created diſorder; for, as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0686100202:60"/>the bad paſſions were now let looſe upon the world, indolence ſeized upon the comforts which had been acquired by induſtry; and hence ſprang domeſtic conteſt and civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and half mankind were at war. Thoſe that obtained the victory held the conquered as his ſlave; and from hence originated thoſe diſtinctions, which, obtained by rapacity, and kept by force, were after ſanctified by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inſtitutions: for upon this (find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men were to be reſtrained from violence and invaſion only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, terror, and authority,) the laws came in to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>ſtronger</hi> party: the difference betwixt meum and tuum was ſoon underſtood, and every individual maintained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon that which was now ſecured
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0686100202:61"/>to him by certain compacts, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late which was henceforth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a puniſhable crime. By this time an idea of property became ſacred and general, and by theſe means the civilized part of the earth was ſaid to belong, not as formerly, to all alike, but to a third part of its inhabitants. Subordination therefore of neceſſity took place. The pride of power gained ground every day, and one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creature uſurped dominion over another, becauſe the diſtinction was now known betwixt maſter and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. From maſter and ſervant roſe notions of great privileges, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty dropt ſubmiſſive at the knee of riches. Paſtorals and Arcadia were no more.

                  <p>—Affairs once ſettled on theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial principles, reſiſted every effort of revocation—for who that could eat his bread without ſweating his brow, would give up the advantages he had gained. Centuries are now behind us, ſince things were thus regulated, and every year hath given force and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerableneſs to the eſtabliſhment. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0686100202:63"/>man has given up the point, and makes the moſt of his ſituation: the clown riſes early to the taſk of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the maſter looks indolently on, and receives the profit. Luxury was introduced under theſe auſpices —the beverage of the field—the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad of the brook, and the water of the ſpring—with the homely apparel that decently veil'd and warmed the body, were rejected, and Voluptuouſneſs turned Simplicity bluſhing away. The moment in which man became poſſeſt of more than was neceſſary to the wholeſome purpoſes of life; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which his induſtry became nerveleſs, and his love of labour to ſlacken; pride ſoon taught leiſure, to miſuſe abundance, and the paſſions to wanton with authority—Hence,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0686100202:64"/>ſome revelled in the riots of diſſipation, others found a pleaſure in accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſome better ſpirits had a bliſs in diſtribution. At length through the natural chain of conſequences, we are arrived at the <hi>criſis.</hi> We are poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, populated, and reſined in the extreme. Diſtinctions are ſo minute, property ſo tenacious, ſplendor ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, and trade ſo jealous, that no diſtreſſes you obſerve ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you. Money hath acquired a univerſal aſcendency, property hath "ſubdued all things under her feet;" and luxury ſickens in deſpair, becauſe novelty is wanting to give an edge to the blunted appetites. Had the uſe of a metal-currency been reſtricted by any reaſonable rule of <hi>moderation,</hi> it might have ſettled the ſyſtem upon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0686100202:65"/>a noble principle, for it is equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to the great purpoſes of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and buſineſs. But the lucky and fortunate have run into two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes ſo egregiouſly abſurd, that the one opens upon us a fountain of <hi>poiſoned pleaſures,</hi> and the other a ſource of <hi>ſordid maxims.</hi> The paſſion for waſting on the one hand, and of hoarding on the other, have not only involved the world in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and thrown the paſſions into an uproar but have actually left almoſt one <hi>half</hi> of the human ſpecies naked and ſtarved, to cloath and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the <hi>other.</hi>

                  <p>You have diſcovered to me Mr. Greaves, ſaid I, a train of obſervations of which I had no idea—but you are preparing to ſpeak—and I would not interrupt you for the univerſe—</p>
                  <p>The obſervations I have made, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Mr. Greaves,) have been no doubt made, (and much more ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,) by many others, for contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, philoſophy, and ſcience, have now gone very far; our diſcoveries in letters and in lands, may perhaps have been pretty equal. There may be yet unknown tracks in ſpeculation; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect may ſtill abound with new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of wiſdom. There is ſtill, it is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0686100202:67"/>preſumed, a <hi>terra incognita;</hi> there may be ſtill an undug mine of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>—To explore this, muſt be the labour of ſome literary Columbus—I pretend not to ſuch ſkill; and indeed can only aſſure you, that I offer you frankly, on this ſubject the unadorned facts which I have collected from early readings and practical obſervations. —You run your eye haſtily over the <hi>world,</hi> and then complain that it abounds with miſery. After what has been ſaid, ſhould you not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find a great deal of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and yet, diſtributed up and down the various parts of it, there really is a very conſiderable ſhare. That the infelicity grows out of all proportion ſtill <hi>more</hi> conſiderable cannot eaſily be determined—for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0686100202:68"/>though the fate of thouſands can only be made ſupportable, by the chearful expectation of a <hi>better,</hi> and though the human heart is in general blinded by temporal prejudices, yet coarſe as the maſs of gratifications are that <hi>endear</hi> life to the multitude, they are nevertheleſs gratifications, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive attachment from cuſtom. The joys of more delicate minds are indeed leſs extended, and lie in a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, being confined to the little circle of the few, whoſe feelings are ſoftened by nature, and refined by art. But were the agonies of exiſtence, ſtill greater and acuter than they <hi>are,</hi> the DEITY is not the author of it—he made the world—ſurvey it, ſir, (even through the ſhadings of the evening) and tell me, if it is not worthy of a divine
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0686100202:69"/>artificer. He made man to inhabit it —has he not beſtowed amiable and ample faculties upon him—fitted him equally to enjoy ſociety and ſolitude —given him a power to derive a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the freſhneſs of the gale, or from the convivial glaſs—has not he beſtowed upon him eyes to <hi>ſee</hi> misſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, an heart to <hi>feel</hi> it, and arms to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> it? Has he not implanted in the mind a ſympathy between the ſexes, ſo attractive, that by a kind of magnetic power, we are irreſiſtibly drawn to each other, that life may be perpetuated while love is unpolluted? Has he not given us early ideas of more diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted attachments, and inſpired us with diſpoſitions, to philanthropy and friendſhip! has he not ſeated in the boſom a monitor, to compliment
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0686100202:70"/>us for every thing that is becoming, and accommodated the taſte with end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs variety,—is not the ear enchanted by the harmonies of nature—and the ſmell gratified with perfume; and to crown the whole, has he not placed certain intimations in the ſoul, which aſſure it that <hi>however</hi> agreeable the Deity may have rendered the preſent ſlate, it is but a paſſage; and upon the eaſy terms of our acting properly to <hi>him,</hi> and each <hi>other,</hi> will lead us gently along, till it terminates in <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi>

                  <p>—This, my young friend, is a ſaint ſketch of the works and intentions of the Deity—that thoſe works and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are abuſed, can never be imputed to their all-kind Author, but to <hi>man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the beauties and benefits of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are perverted; if the faculties of the mind and body are obſtinately bent to actions evidently contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the purpoſes for which they were given; if love and friendſhip are overborne by their oppoſite paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and, if—as has been before hinted, <hi>intereſt</hi> carries away the palm from earth and heaven—who but man
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0686100202:72"/>is chargeable with the conſequences of this general inverſion of bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?—</p>
                  <p>The fact is indiſputable, ſir, ſaid I— I tremble, and I adore; but as Mr. Blewitt ſeemed always to perform the purpoſes for which he was born a man, how is it, that he, and others like him, ſhould not paſs ſmoothly through the ſea of life. Becauſe, ſaid the gentleman—to carry on the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor—when the ſtorm is violent, and the hurricane extreme, it is certain the good and bad ſailors will be wrecked alike. Is not that <hi>ſtrange,</hi> ſaid I—"Shall gravitation ſtop as you go by, replied Mr. Greaves?—no, ſir. The chain of cauſes and conſequences is irrefragable—that innocence ſhould ſuffer in a world of guilt is morally
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0686100202:73"/>inevitable, but depend upon it, the ſuffering will not be <hi>ultimately</hi> in vain.</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. Blewitt, I compaſſionate and admire him, but he is one of thoſe characters, whoſe amiable weakneſſes expoſe him to almoſt <hi>certain poverty.</hi> The poor man was kind, to a fault— the world would call him, a good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured fool—Indeed he was wrong, ſir, to indulge the tenderneſs of his feeling in the extreme; though this cannot be owned, without its implying at the ſame time a very cutting ſatire againſt the depravity of human nature —a depravity I have all along taken notice of, as the ſource of ſo much diſaſter, and calamity.—</p>
                  <p>Mr. Blewitt did not reflect that —as money is the property by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0686100202:74"/>which every paſſion is gratified, man will naturally idolize it as the golden calf; and that, to adopt a few ſaving maxims, in relation to keeping a part of ſuch property always at command, would be favourable even to his <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity;</hi> becauſe it muſt needs be a deep misfortune to find the hand, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to liberallity, compelled to contract, when it can give no more. —In a country where <hi>appearances</hi> of wealth, can claim veneration, where money acquires the chymic quality of turning every thing it approximates into gold, and where that gold is moreover able to array inſamy in the robe of integrity, and lead the judgments of the wiſeſt blind-fold as it pleaſes—In ſuch a country, every <hi>apparent want</hi> of this property,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0686100202:75"/>will be liable to neglect and ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—and every degree of indigence will meet deſertion, for this plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe indigence has nothing either to procure or excite the idea of authority, nor to obſerve thoſe rules which externally diſtinguiſh the maſter from the ſervant. You will ſay perhaps, all this ſort of diſtinction is ridiculous. No doubt of it; but as more than fifty, out of ſixty have adopted ſuch diſtinctions,—as they are actually the general ſtandards of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,—as they are alſo <hi>more</hi> than two thouſand years old—it is in vain to diſpute their propriety—one might as well diſpute the cuſtoms of a country —tell the Indian, it is indecent to go naked, or that a Toledo dangling by the ſide of the Spaniſh peaſant, muſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0686100202:76"/>be extremely inconvenient. Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy therefore is now almoſt the only ſecurity from contempt, and though it were too narrow a line to tread in the track of the grocer, as <hi>no</hi> real joy could ariſe from ſuch a rigid policy, neither to lend ſix-pence, nor borrow ſix-pence, yet I (and I think my heart not an unfeeling one) —have always found it ſound pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to keep a friend in my <hi>pocket,</hi> and on no terms to lie at the mercy and compaſſion of another.—</p>

                  <p>—It was now night, and we were in the middle of Finchley Common— The driver bid us ſecure part of our money, if we had any great quantity about us, for that he ſaw a fellow lurking by the ſide of the road, at a little diſtance.—In five ſeconds we were up with the man, who was groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piteouſly upon a graſſy hillock. Mr. Greaves, (who knew the arts of his own ſpecies) ſuſpected this to be an impoſition, and oppoſed my deſire to have him lifted into the chaiſe— But theſe ideas were preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, for the ſtranger got up, and coming to the window, preſented
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0686100202:78"/>not a piſtol, but—a <hi>purſe.</hi> The chaiſe ſtopt—</p>
                  <p>Half an hour ago, gentlemen—ſaid the man—a horſeman came by me, and I was tempted, (to ſupply the wants of a large family) to demand his money—He put into my hand this purſe.—I conjure you, gentlemen, if by any ſtroke of happy chance he ſhould be any part of your company— take it, and return it to him juſt as I received it—It is my firſt violation of the laws, either of hoſpitality or my country—I might poſſibly return home undiſcovered, but I <hi>feel</hi> that I cannot bear it. My conſcience is vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious even over my neceſſities If you ſhould not know the traveller I have plundered—it is ſtill in your power to do my bleeding ſoul ſome
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0686100202:79"/>ſervice—Upon your arrival in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don advertiſe the circumſtances of the robbery—take the property and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliver it, upon the firſt application.— This I cannot do for myſelf, without throwing myſelf into the arms of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and the ſituation of a wife, (whom I doat on, with the fate of my poor little ones,) forbid my deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—ſo ſaying—he threw the purſe into the chaiſe and was going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.—</p>
                  <p>There was ſomething ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual in this new mode of attacking, that it was ſome time before Mr. Greaves could ſpeak.—For my own part I was in a ſtate of mind betwixt trembling and crying.—At length Mr. Greaves, who could no longer doubt of the offender's ſincerity, invited him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0686100202:80"/>to accompany us in the chaiſe, if he was going to town, pledging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the ſame time, as a man of honour, not to betray him.—The poor man after the deliberation of a minute —ſighed and aſcended—though the poſtilion muttered that we might be tranſported for harbouring robbers, and might repent it before we got over the common yet.—</p>
                  <p>Our converſation on the way was ſuch as might have touched the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heart.—As ſoon as we were upon the pavement, the gentleman got out, but not before we had obtained the ſecret of his addreſs—The driver ſeeing him eſcape—ſaid—he had a great mind to cry ſtop thief, for that he was ſure 'twas hanging matter— and he was not certain whether

                     <hi>he</hi> ſhould not come to the gallows for it himſelf, ſeeing as how he was aiding and <hi>abutting.</hi> In this conjecture he was perfectly prophetic, for upon my travelling the ſame road in my way to the village, about ſix months after, I underſtood that this very identical nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded driver, had actually mounted, ſome little time before, for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in confederating with a gang of highwaymen, to whom he gave intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, what company had made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments to paſs by his maſter's houſe, in their return to town.—The poor man inſiſted upon leaving the purſe, but we did our beſt to alleviate his miſerable condition, by an equal preſent of five guineas—I was going to give ten, but Mr. Greaves geatly pluckt me by the button, obſerving
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0686100202:82"/>to me afterwards, that five, at another opportunity, would very likely double their utility.</p>

                              <p>I have now been an inhabitant of the foreſt only five weeks—I have got a few birds—my old dog, ſo frequently mentioned in the latter part of my hiſtory—a cat that ſtrolled one day into my cottage, which is nothing better than a collection of ſticks cloſely compacted, ſodded at the top, and carpetted with ſacks at the bottom —I am at the extremity,—God has permitted me to finiſh my adventures, wherein every thing that happened to me in the <hi>world,</hi> or in the <hi>wood,</hi> is accounted for—I find I am no

                  <p>This hiſtory, madam, together with other adventures in the world (with which at ſome future period, that world may be made acquainted) —have led me to a ſecluſion almoſt as retired from the buſtle and intrigue of life, as the unhappy author of the Legend. I intend my memoirs ſhall ſerve as the counterpart of his; and both will indiſputedly prove and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, the peculiar truth of theſe ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>That, nine times out of ten, a life of benevolence is a life of inſult and pain.</p>
                  <p>That an unwearied attention to the pleaſure and comfort of others, is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0686100202:102"/>generally repaid by ingratitude from the world.</p>
                  <p>And that (in a <hi>terreſtrial</hi> ſenſe)— tracing the fact through all claſſes of life, from the nobleman in his villa to the beggar in his ſhed—goodneſs is not often, in this world, rewarded by ſuch returns from <hi>our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as conſtitute thoſe ſenſations, which are included in our ideas of happineſs.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of the whole, madam, will be,</p>

                     <label>Firſt,</label> 
                     <hi>To be good,</hi> would, to all intents and purpoſes, be to be happy, had not man degenerated in the extreme; and had not his worldly intereſt prevailed over the proſpects and promiſes of futurity.</p>

                     <label>Secondly.</label> That the world is permitted to exiſt, for the ſame reaſons it was ſpared in years which are far behind, when the Omnipotent declared with his own facred voice that—if ten, or even five, juſt people could be found, the city (over which the almighty arm of vengeance, was raiſed in ſuſpenſion) ſhould be ſpared.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <label>Thirdly.</label> That, the perverſion of money, and the abuſe of riches, has contributed more to the corruption of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, over every part of the habitable globe, than any other thing, ſince the invention of a commerce with it.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <label>Fourthly.</label> That, this world (and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the poliſhed and voluptuous parts
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0686100202:104"/>of it) would be intolerable, to a truly good mind, and, of all poſſible places of torment, the moſt ſevere, (to men engaged in ſociety, but unengaged in its general aims) were it not for two reaſons, which will not only be fully given in the promiſed hiſtories —but may be briefly ſeen in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive parts of theſe volumes.</p>
                  <p>But before we purſue ſubjects of ſo grave a nature, I ſhall beg your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's leave to offer ſome lighter amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—I fear I have made you gloomy —let us then inſtantly return to our fancy-pieces—amongſt theſe I muſt number a little piece of poetry, wrote a year after leaving ſchool. I ſhall preſent your ladyſhip with this with all the marks of juvenility about it—poor Benignus thought much
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0686100202:105"/>of robbing an orchard. His idea might be right, but I muſt confeſs to you, that for my part, though I had a pretty early knowledge of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> I was not quite ſo ſcrupulous, as to this particular. Benignus was likewiſe frequently inſulted for this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence—now I avoided inſult, by the only way to eſcape it, either in a ſchool or in the world—for I was one of their own ſort,—did as they did, and was as thoughtleſs, and as trickful as the beſt, or rather—the worſt of them—the evils of life, did not ſeize me ſo ſoon, as they ſeized Benignus— When your ladyſhip, at a future day, ſhall read my memoirs, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive too many reaſons for an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſentiment.</p>

               <p>Did ever your ladyſhip behold the ſlope of any wood more beautiful than that, which riſes by ſoft gradations, from the ſpot which my cottage occupies, to the warm boundary of hills, which form a vegetable ſcreen for the valley? —every buſh is blooming with perfume, and every tree is pendent with bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms—the hand of nature has woven me a carpet, ſo diverſified in colours, and ſo fantaſtically figured, that the utmoſt pride of Turkey droops even to dullneſs, on the compariſon—and hark! madam—the note of pleaſure affords for the <hi>ear,</hi> as fair a banquet as the proſpects of ſummer afford for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0686100202:112"/>the <hi>eye.</hi> Murmuring along the brake, (intercepted in its paſſage by the peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) a ſmall rill of water winds its way along the grove, and at laſt is heard, bubbling into the brook at the bottom—the river rolls majeſtically ſlow at a little diſtance; and a ſtately ſwan (the empreſs of the tide!) ſails ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>important on its boſom. On the left hand is a flock at feed, while ſome of the lambkins are ſlumbering in the ſun, and ſome friſking round the buſhes—on the right, the muſicians of the ſeaſon are warbling in the concert, and the pauſes of harmony are ſupplied by the ſonorous ſplaſh of the neighbouring water-mill. The green ſod embelliſhes the ſeat round my hut—the woodbine comes nodding into my caſement, and vegetation
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0686100202:113"/>goes ſmiling, even to my door—ſuch is the outſide of my little place.—</p>
               <p>And now I ſubmit the matter to your ladyſhip—could I, with any fort of juſtice to myſelf, or it, have paſſed into the ſweet hut, without pulling you one moment by the ruffle, to ſhew you how prettily I ſtood; and that neither I, nor my ſociety, left the town without being decently provided for in the country.—</p>
               <p>—Upon reading over the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my cottage a <hi>ſecond time,</hi> I cannot help thinking it would make a ſmart morſel for the magazines or for the next poetical noſegay Mr. Dodſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſhall think fit to gather from the fugitive flowers of this <hi>literary land</hi>— but as I was fearful of detaining your ladyſhip, I have ſpoken of the matter

               <p>—Oh Romeo,—Romeo, what a creature wert thou!—how courteous —how ſagacious—how well temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!—</p>
               <p>He was deſcended, madam, from a glorious line — the ſon of a noble ſtock—venerable from his pedigree —royal in his extraction, and, to crown his character, he was the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite companion of a dear friend of mine who is now—no more.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0686100202:117"/>In one of the ſharpeſt days, and yet one of the faireſt that winter could produce, the youthful Flavian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with his gun and his Romeo, to take the diverſions of the field—hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of men—happieſt of dogs—They were particularly lucky, and it was a day of eminent ſucceſs—this pointed the game—that brought it to the ground —the net was ſoon crouded with the ſpoil,—but as Flavian was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the elevation of your rank, your ladyſhip muſt have had frequent occaſion to deplore the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious uncertainty of ſublunary enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—muſt have ſeen the eye that in the preſent moment ſparkled with hope, in the next rolling with deſpair —and tears uſurp the features which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0686100202:118"/>an hour before were dimpled by joy —this is indeed ſo hackneyed and univerſal a fact, that I ſhould beg your pardon for digreſſing into a parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis about it.</p>
               <p>As Flavian was returning to his houſe, and Romeo was ranging the ſkirts of acopſe, rather in the way of wantonneſs than induſtry—knowing perhaps, that the buſineſs of the day was already done—juſt as the winding of the thicket meander'd into an elbow that jutted into the field,—Romeo broke ſhort his ſtep, and ſtood fixed in an attitude, which put Flavian on his guard. In the next inſtant an hare ſtarted from the buſhes, and ran tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the oppoſite hedge-row; on the other ſide of which, was a ſhaded lane, that led to Flavian's villa.—
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0686100202:119"/>There is an enthuſiaſm, which ſeizes the ſportman at the ſight of ſudden game. With that ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration was Flavian now ſeized, who, levelling his gun to the mark (with an aim too fatally erring) depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the charge into the boſom of —* —*.</p>
               <p>—Mighty God,—I want forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to go on!—</p>
               <p>Flavian, madam, had—a wife—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily for him, ſhe was tempted by the brightneſs of the morning, and the report of his fowling piece at no great diſtance, to ſtrole from her houſe, and —as was ſometimes her tender cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom—intended to haſten his return, not only to enjoy his ſociety, but to put an end to the depredations of the day.—The ſound of the gun had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0686100202:120"/>ſcarcely died upon the air, when a ſound of a different kind ſaluted the ear: Flavian daſhed through the hedge, and ſaw his Maria extended along the path-way, which was over-hung by the buſhes, and her boſom was bathed in that blood, which ſhe now found had been ſhed by her huſband. In purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the game, Romeo firſt diſcovered his miſtreſs, and with his four-feet upon her lap, was mourning over her wounds: the agony was ſo legible in his countenance, that if he had the power of ſpeech—it would have been impoſſible to deſcribe it.</p>
               <p>The huſband—ah, madam! In theſe caſes, as I have juſt remarked —the brute and the man are alike; ſince both muſt deliver over to the dumb ſenſations of the heart, a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0686100202:121"/>neither ſcience nor inſtinct can teach them to articulate—all that can be ſaid or done is dull painting,—he ſtruck his breaſt—caſt an eye of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at heaven, and fell ſpeechleſs by her ſide—the poor woman ſaw his agony—madean effort to embrace him, but ſunk exhauſted on his breaſt.</p>
               <p>A ſervant of Flavian's, who had been on a meſſage, now appeared upon the road in the lane—Romeo ran to him,—leaped round his horſe,—looked up to the man—and led the way to the ſcene of death—The ſervant rode away on the ſpur, to alarm the family at the manſion-houſe—in the mean time, the laſt endearments were faintly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged betwixt Flavian and Maria —to the latter, articulation was ſoon denied—but ſhe; by ſome means, got
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0686100202:122"/>her huſband in her arms, and in that ſituation expired—the diſtreſs of Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian affected not even yet his tongue —the dear body, mangled as it was, could not be torn from him, and both he and the unhappy lady, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to that apartment, from which they had parted a few hours before, in the higheſt gaiety of wedded hearts, and in the warmeſt ardours of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation. And now comes on the buſineſs of poor Romeo—Flavian fell ſick—Romeo was the very centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of his door, and the nurſe of his chamber—a fever followed, which at length touched Flavian on the brain, and in the violence of the delirium he ſtruck his poor attendant Romeo, who ſo far from reſenting the blow, licked lovingly the hand that gave it—
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0686100202:123"/>madneſs ſhifted into melancholy— Romeo was ſtill by the ſide of the bed, fearful to ſtep even on the carpet— after this—the fever returned, and burning its way to the heart, in a few days deſied phyſic, and united his aſhes to thoſe of his beloved Maria—from the room in which he died no force or contrivance could ſeduce Romeo, till the moment in which he was put into the coffin, and the people concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his funeral began to deem it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to deſtroy the dog, which reſiſted all their meaſures, but eſpecially their carrying him away; at length he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it—but followed them cloſe, and was perhaps the moſt ſincere mourner—as ſoon as Flavian was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the earth, his faithful Romeo took dominion of the ſpot, and was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0686100202:124"/>the ſentry of his grave—grief and hunger had exhauſted every thing— but his attachment—yet he never was heard to whine—but, after laying till nature could do no more, he was at length found dead at the foot of the tomb—thus the maſter expired, and the ſervant found it impoſſible to ſurvive him.—</p>
               <p>— Methinks I ſee your ladyſhip ſhed a tear to the complicated misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of this family—I congratulate you upon it—Fie upon the heart that is aſham'd to feel—and wither'd be the cheek, that (in defiance of the impulſes of nature) is kept dry, by the maxims of faſhion!—but neither the above ſtory, madam, nor any other, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent volumes, were introduced merely to excite ſenſibility—It finds a place amongſt theſe pages, as a ſuitable ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle for ſome</p>

               <p>In the few anecdotes of Benignus, were briefly ſhewn that, nine times out of ten—To be good, in this world
<q>Was not the way—To be happy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That is—not to be happy, if our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and its conſequences, were to take their rewards from the returns of our fellow-creatures in general— The reaſon aſſigned for this, is the only true reaſon that can be aſſigned —The degenerate ſtate of maxims, and manners.—</p>
               <p>All the evils therefore which are of a malignant nature—all ſuch as ariſe from the perverſion of money—or turbulence of paſſions, are totally to be imputed, to human ſources—but there are other evils (and ſome extremely
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0686100202:126"/>ſore) that fall out, to make goodneſs no ſecurity for worldly happineſs— Theſe—(I mean ſuch as abſolutely are placed beyond the reach, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of man,) are certainly the acts of the Deity,—we call them, under the vague name of <hi>accidents</hi> —they light equally on man and beaſt, and every thing that hath an exiſtence; and (for ought we can tell) they may poſſibly affect vegetation, and carry the diſtreſs beyond the ſcale that is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. As great proportions of that miſery which cloggs the path of life therefore is cauſed by the bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities of men—ſo it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be admitted, that the road which leads from this world to the next, is made additionally weariſome and heavy, by the permiſſion of ſome power ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0686100202:127"/>to theirs. It is peculiar to the moſt rational animal (as he is called), to perceive this, though he cannot adequately account for it—to account for it indeed has been the labour of the moſt ſhining underſtandings!— divines—moraliſts—theologiſts—phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers—metaphyſicians, and poets, have exerted every nerve, in every age upon the ſubject. The moſt pions and induſtrious of theſe all concur in their ſentiments, and conclude with the ſame ideas,—They ſay</p>
               <p>That, though to be good may not be rewarded in general with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our fellow-creatures, and that virtuous characters are commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by the multitude (who are creatures of ignorance and intereſt) yet a man is ſufficiently rewarded for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0686100202:128"/>his rectitude (even in this world), by the endearing ſociety of men like himſelf—beſides which,—the comforts of conſcience are more than a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalance for the ſevereſt ſufferings —to which are added the chearful proſpects of futurity.—</p>
               <p>That with reſpect to all thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs diſaſters which fall out in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of human ſagacity—the anſwer always has been and ſtill continues to be this—They are trials—&amp;c.—&amp;c.—</p>
               <p>There is indiſputably a great deal of conſolitary truth in both theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Some part of the argument however is liable to objection—zeal will very often run away with the powers of reflection. The ſyſtem of men of religious moderation is comprized in the ſhort paſſages above.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0686100202:129"/>More intemperate people, who call themſelves free thinkers, have under that title aſſumed a privilege, to argue very boldly on the other ſide of the queſtion. Some have contended that if vice is natural to the heart of man, it muſt be an effort as ridiculous as impoſſible to reſiſt it—the ſhocking inference is, that God is the ſole origin of evil, and that he certainly would not puniſh his creatures for yielding to a neceſſity in their nature —others, madam, of our own nation (the very ſoil of free-thinking) ſay, it would be an act of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to withdraw evil from every part of the globe—another aſſerts, that vices and miſeries of all kinds are peculiar benefits, and that, to a trading nation eſpecially, they are the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0686100202:130"/>very main-ſpring in the political machine. There have alſo been (and ſtill are,) a ſet of looſe pens, which (ſkilled in the trick of ſophiſtry) exculpate every wickedneſs in man at the blaſphemous riſque of lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe and fault of the whole upon the <hi>Deity;</hi> and a celebrated Frenchman (whoſe genius is the pride of that polite nation) has written a book in the ſeventieth year of his age, to prove, that of all poſſible ſyſtems, the ſyſtem under which we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned is the worſt. Theſe deſerve and meet the indignation of every honeſt man. A much anmired coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman of our own, madam, has, in a compoſition that contains the moſt poetical philoſophy in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, advanced ſeriouſly an oppoſite
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0686100202:131"/>ſentiment, and terminates the whole by declaring, whatever is, is right.— My own opinions on this important ſubject are, I dare ſay, like thoſe of your ladyſhip—I think <hi>every</hi> work of God vindicable; but I do not think, ſome of them reconcilable to reaſon, by the beaten mode of defending them. There are at this inſtant, thouſands of our amiable fellow-creatures in the world (bad as it is)—ſtruggling with the ſtorms of fate, without finding relief in the ſociety of men like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for it will be eaſy to prove, that even the tendereſt and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt connexions of a man fly off in the hour of neceſſity; nor will it be more difficult to ſhew—(if it could poſſibly need an inſtance beyond the reach of any one's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience)—that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0686100202:132"/>poverty (in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme) is often accompanied with the loſs of reputation. Thoſe are yet babies in the world, who ſuppoſe half the bad reports they hear of men, are the conſequences of their ill conduct: for the fact is, that there are a pretty equal number of wretches deſerted by their friends (becauſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs unſitted them for what is called virtuous ſociety) and of wretches deſerted, becauſe their ill-luck in life drove them too often againſt the purſes of their acquaintance—for I muſt once again repeat, that the abuſe of riches has made avarice the ruling vice—and there is ſometimes the higheſt degree of avarice even in diſſipation— ſelf ſtill ſettles at the bottom. Nor are even the comforts of conſcience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0686100202:133"/>ſufficient to bear a man up, againſt the inſults of mankind: for many of our ſpecies are ſo pelted by the tempeſts of life, that the pureſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and the ſweeteſt reflections <hi>reſulting</hi> from that integrity, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give way to the misfortunes which croud inceſſantly upon them. Sorrow treads faſt upon ſorrow, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſtrikes upon calamity, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident comes ſtumbling ſo rapidly upon accident, that the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>ſoul</hi> is to ſhift for the neceſſities of the <hi>body;</hi> or to try the force of its religion, to accommodate itſelf with proper patience, to bear its allotment, without plunging into the errors of deſpair. Inſtances of this kind are extremely numerous. Men indeed who are plumped by proſperity and indolently loiter out an unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0686100202:134"/>exiſtence, in the eaſy chair of voluptuouſneſs; and women who are tied down to a peculiar ſet of amuſements, ideas, and purſuits, may ſee this matter in the light, which their contracted teachers have <hi>taught</hi> them to ſee it. But the ſons and daughters of luck and luxury, are the worſt judges of the ſons and daughters of misfortune. The grand amulet—the only <hi>effectual</hi> remedy of ſorrow remains behind, and that is a <hi>univerſal</hi> one—ample enough for the cure of miſery, even tho' <hi>miſery</hi> was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal—<hi>the proſpects of futurity</hi>—when friends forſake us—foes oppreſs us— and conſcience is cowed, by conſtant adverſity—thoſe, madam, and thoſe only, prevent deſpair, and point to felicity.—With regard to the evils of

In ſhort, madam, the human ſoul
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0686100202:136"/>ebbs and flows like the ocean, though not with the ſame regularity. There is no purity, nor any devotion, but ſometimes wavers for a <hi>moment:</hi> believe me, there are periods when the moſt apoſtolic faith ſtaggers— aye, and that upon principle; for the better the mind, the greater is its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional agitation. Divines tells us, it is ſinful. I inſiſt, it is unavoidable, and I will in this caſe be ſo bold to enter a caveat againſt all the caſſocks in the kingdom. There is an intricacy in the events of the world which will on the firſt view conſtantly appear myſterious. They frequently put the human intellect upon the puzzle. We want not books, or arguments, to teach us ambiguities; for every <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſenſe</hi> about us preſſes the <hi>whys</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0686100202:137"/>and <hi>wherefores</hi> ſpontaneouſly and irreſiſtibly upon us. 'Tis not, madam, the vanity of penetration: 'tis mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the curioſity and inquiring propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of nature.</p>
               <p>It was, with a propriety peculiar to the claſſic genius of Mr. Addiſon, that he called theſe labyrinths of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that ſo frequently croſs the lines of life—"a regular conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion." Let us examine that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated expreſſion, and it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps lead us into a train of thought, which may throw new light on our preſent ſubjects, both with relation to man and brute. The eye of God, (and poſſibly the eyes of his angels) may ſee the regularity, unintangled in the confuſion. But what proves this more, than that finite can by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0686100202:138"/>no means, meaſure with infinite? To man's imperfect viſion, many events already hinted at in this letter, and many more which might be brought into the catalogue of inſtances, are not only repugnant to every moral, natural, or conſcientious law (were we to decide of them by the narrow line of human juſtice) but are utterly oppoſite to our own ideas of common compaſſion. Still farther. I beg leave to advance the matter <hi>much</hi> farther. It is a fact, (atteſted by the tears and agonies of a mournful mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude) that the horrid variety of miſeries which attack the attention on all ſides, would tempt the ſobereſt head, and the devouteſt heart, in the world, to ſuſpect that the affairs of that world were totally eclipſed in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0686100202:139"/>without a ſingle ray of apparent regularity: judging, (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above) and faintly guided through <hi>the dark,</hi> only by the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light glimmerings of natural reaſon, and natural equity.</p>
               <p>To prove this, there ariſe at once ſo many inſtances, that choice is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext in variety. Let us quit the fire-ſide, madam, for half an hour, and, turning our eyes on the active world, walk leiſurely along to ſurvey the great ſcenes that are ſlecting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0686100202:141"/>ſtairs, and open the door of that chamber. Pray ſurvey it with a critical eye. The ſpectre Famine hath uſurped the ſeat of Plenty. There are ſeven ſmall children, without any ſymptoms of the health, and roſy hilarity, which uſually attends the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled period of life—the pale young woman, whoſe arm is round one of the youngeſt, with one (ſtill ſmaller) which ſhe is dandling on her knce, is their mother; and that tottering phantom of a man, whom age hath rendered fecbler than the feebleſt of the children, is the father of that mother—I beg pardon: I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked a perſonage, of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. At the ſide of the broken lattice you behold, one of the king's officers. He has a paper in his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0686100202:142"/>hand, a pen in his mouth, and his eyes are running up and down the room, in the moſt eager diſpatch. For once, we will diſpenſe with faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable ceremonies, and peep over his left ſhoulder. This method has enabled us to read, what he entitles</p>

               <p>To be carried off or ſold the 18th inſt.</p>
               <p>—Sold! Heavens! Huſh, madam, —I perceive you are prepared with many queſtions. The anſwers are melancholy to every thing you can ſay. See, madam, the good man has diſcharged his duty (in which we muſt bear teſtimony he was conſcientiouſly particular) and is going out of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0686100202:144"/>room: we will follow his example— ah—madam, the tears are ſwimming round your eye, and your hand is in your pocket. There then—God proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you with it, poor woman: ſee if one of the infants, is not quite taken with the flowers upon your ladyſhip's gown, another faintly plucks me by the ſkirt of my coat, and is paying ſtrong court to my buttons—the mother is upon her knees to you—ſhe thinks and looks the gratitude ſhe is unable to ſpeak—let us hurry away before the ſcene becomes too intereſting — even the ſmoky air of one of the moſt ſmoky ſtreets of the ſuburbs is chearful, and ſalubrious, to the oppreſſion I felt in the chamber we have juſt left—A coach will carry us to a more agreeable part of the town
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0686100202:145"/>inhabited by different ſort of people —in this ſquare we will ſtop, for here is breathing-room. Hark, how the roll of the chariots, the report of the horſes feet, and the echo of the doors prepare us for the magnificence of faſhion. We are now in the very region of finery. As ſudden tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have always a great effect—I will now take your ladyſhip into a very ſplendid apartment—theſe folding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors will admit us, <hi>becauſe</hi> we ſhall not look as if we had no doors of our own; for in all caſes of that ſort, there is a peculiar difficulty in getting on the other ſide of the knocker, which, for the moſt part, is ſupported in the jaws of ſome monſter, that ſeems to ſay to every neceſſitous crawler, or even to every ſhabby gentleman—
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0686100202:146"/>come if you dare — approach, and be devoured. Luckily for us, madam, there is always another monſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the inſtant the door opens, and as he conſtantly acts upon the liberal principles of Cerberus, we will give him, a ſufficient ſop; upon which he will become immediately ſo tame that he will make the hinges echo again, even though we were come to dun his keeper. The arts of opening a door, and delivering a meſſage, are ſciences that would very well fill a volume—I ſhall therefore certainly ſtand excuſed for having ſcribbled only a page upon the ſubject.</p>
               <p>We are now walking up the geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical ſtairs—that door opening up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another door, will lead us to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other green door, which will lead us to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0686100202:147"/>the apartment, where the family are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at breakfaſt. How beautifully and warmly the whole room is carpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and cuſhioned—We perceive at the table three hearty children—a lady of an elegant figure, and a gentleman in his night-gown and ſlippers. Bleſs me!—how the ſervants bow—what a profuſion of gilding and plate! and ſee, madam, the youngeſt boy is actually toſſing an handful of guineas up and down the floor by way of amuſement. I heartily wiſh the poor children we have juſt left, had the trouble to pick them up for my young maſter. If your ladyſhip will pleaſe to retire, I will tell you ſomething, as you go along, worth hearing, of this family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0686100202:148"/>The gentleman, madam, whom you ſaw in the morning-dreſs, is one of thoſe human beings Providence hath for ſome wiſe end permitted to hold the happineſs and comforts of a great many other human beings in his poſſeſſion. In the Engliſh language he is known by the name of a <hi>creditor,</hi> the moral definition of which term is ſimply this;—a man who having the good things of this life in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, diſtributes a ſmall portion of thoſe good things to ſuch as are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute; a kind of benevolence, that would reflect dignity upon the author were it not liable to a trifling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which ſome will think a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back upon it—for the benefactor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly chooſes to take in return a ſmall ſlip of paper, by virtue of which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0686100202:149"/>he can torment, and have the perſon benefitted, as it were, on the hip, at a moment's warning; and in fault of payment, acquires full authority, either to ſeize the body, and depoſit it in a jail; or take poſſeſſion of the goods, and turn the body into the ſtreet. In ſome parts of the future hiſtory of Benignus, will be delineat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole and extenſive ſcience of man-catching, wherein will be ſhewn, that the ſlave-trade flouriſhes ſurpriſingly in Great Britain, and that the traffic of buying and ſelling the human ſpecies is daily gaining ground, through every part of his majeſty's dominions: and this is eſteemed ſo curious and original a part of the manuſcript, that I expect a prodigious conſideration for the copy
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0686100202:150"/>—In the above work however, a proper and nice diſtinction is made, as to the nature and contraction of debts, inſomuch that it will infallbily prove a ſure guide to creditor, debtor, and bailiff, for thoſe, madam, are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal agents in this humane and excellent art. I cannot quit this ſubject without preſenting your ladyſhip, with a ſlight ſpecimen of the above ſort of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe. The buſineſs is frequently tranſacted thus: one man in diſtreſs, borrows (in an humble tone, with his hat under his arm, and in all the confuſion of want) of another man, in no diſtreſs whatever, value forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhillings: (as misfortune is apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a ſunſhiny day, even in the midſt of hard weather,) diſappointment trips up the heel of hope, and the day of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0686100202:151"/>reſtitution runs by, in which the ſaid forty ſhillings remains, like the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the wall, againſt him. From that moment the bargain is ſtruck—the purchaſer demands his property, and as the tranſaction is ſanctified by the laws of the land, the carcaſe is at his diſcretion: it is dragg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its friends, and ſo cautiouſly prevented from taking cold in the open air, that it is put very tenderly under lock and key, and bar and bolt, that it is in a perfect cage: here a parcel of crows are ſuffered to peck at it, which are a kind of guarantees to the purchaſer of the body.—</p>
               <p>And now we will go on with our ſtory—the gay ſpark who is the ſubject of our preſent enquiry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a creditor to the poverty-ſtruck
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0686100202:152"/>family whom we ſaw in the ſuburbs of the town, by being landlord or poſſeſſor of a range of ruins, among which is the uncomfortable hut we deſcribed. The maſter of that hut, (who is at preſent out of the way) is amongſt the number of thoſe againſt whoſe tranquillity the dark events of this life were perpetually pointed. —The conſequence of this (which is pretty frequently the caſe) was the deſertion of acquaintances, and the diſtance of friends, and he was often accuſed of obliquity, though in truth he ſeldom deviated into thoſe crooked paths, which juſtly excite agony and ſhame. He was unable to anſwer the inclinations of his heart, and was two years in arrear for the rent. One morning the poor man's wife waited
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0686100202:153"/>at the door of Sophron (for ſo will we call him) and delivered an apology: by great chance the porter thought fit to deliver it immedately, and by a chance ſtill greater, the young woman was admitted into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence chamber, where Sophron was indulging the ſurfeiting luxuries of his ſituation. Diſtreſs had not, at that time, wholly deſtroyed the beauty which was naturally extraordinary in her—ſhe caught the fancy of the preſent moment. Sophron propoſed an immediate treaty, and offered moreover a purſe for the relief of her ſtarving family.—Generous as this might be, ſhe flatly refuſed it. As Sophron was not much accuſtomed to the language of denial, and thought beſides, his offer not only an honour
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0686100202:154"/>but a liberality, he ordered her haſtily to depart. She did ſo, and in going home felt one of thoſe ſenſations, which for a moment relieves the ſenſe of the worſt condition, by the triumph of the conſcience. She told the whole to her huſband, and in his rewarding embrace ſhe felt thoſe ſenſations reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But where miſery is conſtantly ſhifting from one ſorrow to another, the pleaſures of reflection can ſeldom have leiſure to play—What was the reſult of this matter!—withdraw a moment, madam, to that gloomy-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pile—the common receptacle,— the promiſcuous depoſit of diſtreſs and infamy for a length of years—we will wind up the dreadful ſtairs — alas! how does novelty give force to objects, which cuſtom has render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0686100202:155"/>unnoticed! the grating of the bars — the jingle of the keys, and the clank of the chains, I ſee, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify your ladyſhip—pray ſtop awhile, —in that diſmal cell, behold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a wife's unſeaſonable chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and virtue—there lies the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band—Sophron had once riſqued, as he called it, the loan of ten gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas; for that ſum he was arreſted — and for the rent his goods will ſhortly be ſold.</p>
               <p>And here, madam, let me pay a compliment to the juſtice, ſagacity, and chriſtianity of our law-makers,— law-makers of the moſt refined, and poliſhed nation under heaven— who have aſſigned to unfortunate men, who owe and have the leaſt money, a reſidence of the greateſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0686100202:156"/>gloom, hardſhip, and diſcredit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt wretches who have broken at midnight into our houſes—aſſaſſins who have ſhed the blood of our ſpecies, and robbers who commit hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the road. Encircled by ſuch aſſociates is Sophron—his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are famiſhing at home—his wife is condemned to ſee the neceſſity every moment encreaſe — his houſe has ſuffered a diſtreſs—their next mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration muſt be into the ſtreet—the plain reaſon is this—the wife was virtuous—the huſband unfortunate —while the oppreſſor revels in his plenitude, though his fortunes were obtained by fraud, and are diſſipated in every kind of debauchery. Behold, madam, the wife is herſelf entering the cell—ſhe has brought the poor
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0686100202:157"/>creature a ſhare of that refreſhment your ladyſhip's bounty has enabled her to procure.</p>
               <p>Heavens, what a ſhout is there!— See, they are bringing in a freſh pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.—How the old inhabitants cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter round the new comer, as they would ſay, Welcome to Newgate, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—Pray, Mr. Jaylor, what is his crime?—<hi>murder!</hi>—a man was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted yeſterday ſe'nnight under a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic gallows, upon ſtrong ſuſpicion of committing that very murder, which this priſoner has confeſſed. There is a confuſion in the innocence of ſome people, and a croſs concurrence of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking circumſtances, very like the bluſhing evidences of guilt. Such was the preſent caſe—appearances were ſtrong againſt him, human
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0686100202:158"/>ſagacity was baffled, and the victim was given up to the laws—he had a large family, his wife is in a fever— his ſon is burying reflection in the dreadful opiates of the bottle, and his connexions are in deep and diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mourning.</p>
               <p>Yonder, madam, lies a miſerable object—unnatural parents have driven her from home—ſhe is too honeſt to ſteal—ſhe is aſhamed to beg, and being, from the pecularity of her fate, under a neceſſity to borrow—ſhe is at laſt provided for by the bounty of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that humanely allows the wretched juſt food enough, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the ſenſe, and lengthen out the period of calamity.

               <p>Take notice how you team groan under the burthen. They are labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this ſevere weather for the ſervice of man. But obſerve their driver! hark how the knotted whip ſounds on their ſides — The blood guſhes at every ſtroke—the poor things labour in the extremity and when they have ſurmounted the difficuly, the ſanguinary maſter pats them on the neck, not a little pleaſed with the triumphant vigour of his arm. If it could poſſibly be ſuppoſed that brutes deſerved a ſtate of perpetual puniſhment, a large city were ſurely their hell. A few lap-dogs, ſpaniels,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0686100202:160"/>and other favourites excepted—the general treatment of animals is ſavage beyond all compariſon of barbarity — <hi>There</hi> ſtands a cruel wretch who hath beaten out the eye of the fore-horſe for preſuming to ſtir, while the car is unloading; he then curſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the exploit, and concludes the matter by a ſecond blow, becauſe the creature threw its eye in the way of the firſt; and ſee, madam, you fellow, in paſſing, careleſly drives his carriage againſt another that is going a different road; and in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate the intertangled harneſſes both drivers apply to the old remedy, and inſtead of calmly ſetting things right, put the animals on their ſpirit, and every thing is at length torn in pieces: a freſh beating now enſues, and the

               <p>It is an happineſs peculiar to the ſoftneſs of your ſex, and conſiſtent with the delicate proſperity of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male nature and ſituation, madam, that their purſuits and pleaſures entirely lay in ſuch parts of the town, as make ſhocking ſpectacles not very frequent, if we compare them with the more buſy parts of the city.—There is—I cannot but perceive—a civilization of addreſs, an urbanity of demeanour amongſt the very chairmen of St. James's, which we ſhall in vain look for in the meſſengers of Whitechapel,

The politeſſe of the court ever influences in ſome degree the places that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it: but in the city, the ſpirit of humanity is too often trod under feet by the ſpirit of trade: and the laws of trade have, indeed, ſo very little in general to do with the laws of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, that in the full, and I might ſay, the overflowing tide of commercial ſucceſs, a man of buſineſs ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth any life, but ſuch as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to puſh the point of gain to the extremity!—</p>

               <p>As the innocent man, madam, has often loſt his life, and diſgraced his relations on ſuſpicion of guilt—as the hardneſs of a creditor frequently tightens the cord of the law, till it pinches the bowels of a numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily — as there are actually parents in the world which not only deſert their offspring, but ſear up that ſtrong attachment which is generally the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principle of nature—as modeſty, ingenuity, and honeſty, are often har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed by innumerable cares and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities; to ſoothe which even the compliments of the conſcience are not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0686100202:168"/>always adequate—and as—on the other hand,—thoſe to whom fortune hath been fuller-handed, frequently diſturb the good order of ſociety, and uſe their adventitious acquiſitions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote oppreſſion and to extend luxury. —As thoſe who addreſs the Deity in fervor of heart, are often deſtitute of a comfortable proportion of food— wander naked and forlorn through life —and others that have food, want appetite to eat it—while thoſe who never mention the Deity, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force an oath, and give poignancy to blaſphemy, enjoy every temporal good —as even the unblemiſh'd ſtate of childhood, when power is wanting to perpetrate intentional guilt—as the new-born babe frequently ſtruggles with various diſtreſs, at a time when its

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0686100202:171"/>their arguments, and finds them deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive—revelation herſelf ſteps into our relief—ſhe confeſſes, with the poet, there is apparent confuſion in the regularity of Providence,—that the cloudy mirrour, through which the human eye is directed in purblind ſpeculation repreſents the path of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as thorny and crooked, and the road to vice flowery and delightful —but that—were it poſſible for men to wind with their Creator, through all the infinitude of mazes that lead from, firſt cauſes, to ultimate effects—to view all the labyrinths which are abſolutely neceſſary to connect, continue, and complete the ſyſtem, the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be inverted, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity appear, without confuſion—
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0686100202:172"/>Thus therefore, madam, all comes right at laſt.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>To be good is to be happy</l>
                  <l>The confuſion is regular, and</l>
                  <l>Whatever is, is right.</l>
               </q>
               <p>A future life, only—(in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I have mentioned, and in many that I have omitted to mention) can make the preſent life ſupportable, or the preſent ſyſtem equitable. And upon theſe rational principles, I would argue the eſſentiality of that futurity—but not ſo much from the power and wiſdom, as from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of the hand that hath prepared us for it—nor is the attribute of juſtice leſs concerned in this proviſion—for —were the death of the body, the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0686100202:173"/>death alſo of the ſoul,—the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the ſyſtem now ſtands might yet want a malignity in his nature to continue it; and in that caſe, the wiſeſt way to put an end to a man's torments would be the ſhorteſt; and ſuicide would obtain a ſanction from common ſenſe. The very equity and tenderneſs of the ſupreme Power is concerned in a diſtribution of future puniſhments and rewards—to thoſe attributes therefore ſhould every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy creature look up—from them ſhould expect the hour, in which, that which is "now crooked ſhall be made ſtrait," and every unevenneſs be ſmoothed — when the balances ſhall be poiſed by an omnipotent arm, and juſtice at laſt prevail.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0686100202:174"/>Having thus vindicated the ways of God to man, I will now put an end to my letter, and beg you will accept it at the hand of</p>

               <p>As theſe ſketches are deſigned for publication, and are to ſtand at the tribunal of a ſociety of literati, who review and take cognizance of every thing that ventures into this world of compoſition, I ſhall lay myſelf too <hi>negligently</hi> open to their cenſure, if I leave, ultimately, the animal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the lurch—after having all along declared ſo much in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. And this, renders a <hi>poſtſcript</hi> eſſentially neceſſary. Nor ſhould I, indeed, ſtand excuſeable to your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if I omitted ſo material a part of the concluſions to be drawn from our ſurvey of the ſubject—Having vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated—(notwithſtanding
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0686100202:176"/>all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of good men, and the ſucceſſes of bad men)—the diſpenſations of God, towards our own ſpecies, let us now then, madam, in the ſame tranſient, unſyſtematic manner, vindicate the ways of God, to a numerous race of beings, no otherwiſe connected with our ſpecies, than by the ties either of attachment, or neceſſity.—</p>

                  <p>Methinks, madam, the haughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted man, takes fire at this—what! would the wicked wretch put the reptile and the rational upon an equality? Would he give to the almoſt undiſtinguiſhable atom — to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0686100202:177"/>the dog that laqueys my heel, and to various monſters of the foreſt, and the ocean, the ſame proſpects with man? with the erect—the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive—the ſuperior? God vindicated to <hi>brute!</hi>—oh, infamous! blaſphemous! inconſiſtent — ſhall the ox that I kill for the ordinary ſupply of my appetite, and the mule, that I drive for my diverſion, be upon a level with their maſter—are they not all born to accommodate our convenience —are they not all put in ſubjection to our controul, and do we not treat them accordingly.—I have no time to anſwer the cavils of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency — we will proceed cooly, madam.—</p>
                  <p>Let us argue this point from the impulſes of common ſenſe—in our ſurvey of the ſufferings of brutes, it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0686100202:178"/>appeared that with a great deal leſs cauſe, they underwent, at any rate, as much hardſhip as men: our inſpection indeed into this matter, like our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the calamities of our own ſpecies, was ſlight and curſory; but were we to ſet apart a ſerious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to examine the ſubject to the bottom, we ſhould find animal miſery as extended and as exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite as human. I admit that they are deſtitute of reaſon, and it muſt be owned that a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries men ſuffer, frequently give poignancy to the anguiſh: the mind takes, as it were, an intereſt in the ſufferings of the body; thus a blow on the face is reſented, not becauſe of the pain, but becauſe of the idea annexed by the ſoul to ſuch an act—
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0686100202:179"/>and with reſpect to other miſeries and accidents, the mind by ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing often doubles them. This may be brought againſt me as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. It is none, madam. Even if the ſenſations of animal pain were merely corporeal, they muſt be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently terrible, when we conſider that they are moleſted by every innovation of torture — But I do not apprehend their ſenſations of anguiſh only <hi>bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> they have not reaſon, but they have <hi>ſomething</hi> that does the buſineſs of reaſon ſo well, that man is very often put to the bluſh, and is almoſt aſhamed of the privilege that ſets him at the top of the ſcale. The fact is—brutes are as ſenſible of inſults done to each other as men — theſe they reſent indifferently—if they do
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0686100202:180"/>not often reſent the barbarities of men, it is not I ſhould conceive, madam, becauſe they do not feel the indignity, but becauſe the benevolent Creator has implanted in their natures a ſtrong principle, either of terror or obedience — an unlimited idea of human <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,</hi> or an unlimited idea of his <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi> Be this as it may; certain it is, that the ſituation of animals in this life, particularly ſuch as are ſubdued to the domeſtic dominion of man, (and ſuch commonly diſplay the moſt amiable qualities) is not ſuch as can poſſibly make that life upon the whole deſirable. In a ſtate of nature, where they took peaceful poſſeſſion of the woods, it might be different. In their preſent ſtate of ſubordination to the imperious law of man, nothing can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0686100202:181"/>their miſeries, nor can any miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be more diverſified. Will it be urged, that a great many of them are ſavage in their natures, and cruel to each other,—that they are at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual war—invade the repoſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and pleaſures, of one another—that they actually ſubſiſt by murder and rapine—and that man is juſtified in his uſage to them, nor can they upon <hi>this</hi> account fairly claim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or redreſs from Providence. This would prove a ſorry argument. Do not <hi>men</hi> live upon each other—are not they at perpetual war—are not many of them ſavage in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures — do not they diſturb the peace, and invade the property of their fellow-creatures—is not every paltry trick tried, and every dirty
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0686100202:182"/>paſſion put in motion, to perplex, over-reach, and fret one another?— is not this ſo general a fact, that the eye ſees—the ears ear, and the heart feels it <hi>every hour?</hi> Is it not the tale of tradition, — the burthen of compoſition—the hiſtory of the day —and the evidence of every newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper—ſpreads it not over the moſt diſtant climates—from the poliſhed European, who ſeizes his prey under a maſk, to the honeſt Hotentot, who roaſts it upon the ground, and ſits open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down to his banquet?—and yet where, madam, is the man, who would from hence argue, that for theſe reaſons they muſt never look up for mercy, but die without hope, without expectation—without proſpect? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let them mend the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0686100202:183"/>they have been ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted to detect. If the cruel incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſubſiſting in the boſoms of particular brutes, ſtrikes them with horror; let it operate properly upon the <hi>human</hi> heart; but let them reflect, that the <hi>animal</hi> never kills, but to gratify the calls of famine, or in its own defence—but that the <hi>rational</hi> frequently murders for ſport, and inflicts pain from a principle of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of animals, after they leave the preſent world, has been the ſubject of very diſtinguiſhed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; and ſome have very warmly contended for their immortality. Amongſt ſacred writers, Moſes and Solomon, have leaned much in their favour: amongſt moderns, Mr. Locke,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0686100202:184"/>Dr. Hildrop, Soame Jennings, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, have taken up the cauſe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have French, Spaniſh, or Roman authors, been without conjectures on the ſubject. So that I have a ſufficient ſanction, to enter the liſt, as the champion of ſo many <hi>millions</hi> of uſeful, beautiful, and innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>Look, upon your Favourite— how harmleſs!—how affectionate!— would it not hurt you to conſider, that in a very few years, the poor creature muſt putrify in the duſt, and, mixing with it, ſoon become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon earth, without hope of reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? for my part nothing could give a keener ſhock to my ſenſibility than the horrid idea of univerſal annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0686100202:185"/>prevailing over the animal world—I proteſt, madam, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to ſhed a tear to the very ſentiment—Muſt my dear Tabythy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etta,—my demure Grimalcena — my merry Scugypugiſſa—(you will pardon me, madam, for <hi>Italianizing</hi> their names, there is ſomething ſo dreadfully dull and mechanic in the ſound of an Engliſh appellation) muſt all theſe, with that great traveller Tripſea, ſink into nothingneſs!—into oblivion! into dirt!</p>
                  <q>Oh horrible, horrible, moſt horrible!</q>
                  <p>But I ſee, madam, I am likely to ſwell my poſtſcript to the unreaſonable
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0686100202:186"/>ſize of my letter, and yet if you knew how extremely painful it is for a man, warmed by his ſubject, and entertain'd by his ideas—juſt as that ſubject begins to take poſſeſſion of him—while a ſwarm of benevolent arguments are pouring their honey in upon him— and charm him with the proſpect of carrying his point—if you knew the pangs, that laying aſide the pen, in ſo delicate a moment, coſts a writer—you would certainly pity me —however, I have ſaid enough of this matter and every other, juſt to ſhew my <hi>intentions;</hi> and I beg your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip — and I beg alſo my critics may conſider the whole as a mere collection of etchings—the pencil roughly run over them—the out-lines juſt marked
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0686100202:187"/>—but that, the boldneſs—the graces —the proportions—the re-touchings and — the ſiniſhings, — muſt be the buſineſs of ſeveral ſedate cautious, and careful future opportunities.—</p>
