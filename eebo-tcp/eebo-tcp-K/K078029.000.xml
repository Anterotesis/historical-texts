            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ESSAY
UPON THE
Trade to <hi>Africa, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is, no Queſtion, the hardeſt Thing
in the World, to Convince Men's
Judgments againſt their Intereſt, and
perſuade Men to Believe, what they
deſire ſhould not be true.</p>
            <p>This I conceive has been one Cauſe, why
the <hi>African</hi> Company and the Separate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
have Argued ſo long againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſo little purpoſe; till at laſt, they
ſeem to give over Diſputing for Conviction
of one antoher, and labour to poſſeſs other
Men, with the Reaſonableneſs of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Pretenſions; that the World being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0523501200:3"/>
Judges of their Arguments, they that have
the Strength of Reaſon on their Side may
have moſt Voices, and make their Cauſe
moſt Popular.</p>
            <p>But in this they have not been without
their Difficulties, and the Ground they
have gotten on either Side, ſeems hardly
worth the Noiſe it has made: This
ſeems owing Principally to the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
of People's making themſelves
Maſters of the Cauſe, either on one Side
or other, and perhaps a little to the unhappy
Cuſtom of the Age, <hi>viz.</hi> Of appearing for
or againſt, as Parties, Prejudices, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
Examples, or Intereſts Guide us, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by the true Method of Enquiring
into the Bottom of Things, and Impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Judging, according to the Weight of their
proper Merit.</p>
            <p>We chuſe to lay the Blame however, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Peoples Ignorance
in the Cauſe, and hope the Time may
come again, when Men of Senſe ſhall judge
Things as they are, rather than as Men of
Art would make them ſeem to be: In
hopes of this, and to ſhorten this Diſpute if
poſſible, theſe few Thoughts are put into
Print, that Unbyaſs'd Men may ſee by a
clear Light, and make a Judgment of Truth
upon the Matter,</p>
            <p>In order to this, we ſhall briefly, and with
all poſſible plainneſs, enter a little into the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0523501200:4"/>
Merits of the Cauſe, and ſearch to the
Bottom the Tranſaction it ſelf, between
the Company and the Separate Traders:
We ſhall enquire into their Management
of the Trade, as it reſpects themſelves,
the Trade itſelf, and the Nation: Their
Behaviour to one another, how, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what Foundation they have begun
the preſent War between them; how
they become, as no doubt they now are,
Inconſiſtent with one another; and how
their preſent contending Circumſtances are
Inconſiſtent with the Trade it ſelf, and with
the Publick Good of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Original of the Company is known,
and needs take up none of our Time, only
it may a little concern the preſent Diſpute,
to make this one Remark, <hi>viz.</hi> That they
came in by Purchaſe, a Juſt, Lawful, and
Honourable Way; the Circumſtances of
the former Company declining, and they
being in no Condition to carry on the Trade;
and the Trade itſelf appearing then in its
Infancy, to be a moſt Profitable, Uſeful, and
abſolutely neceſſary Branch of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
for theſe Reaſons, the Government
concern'd itſelf, as no doubt all wiſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will, that ſo great an Advantage
ſhould not be loſt to the Nation.</p>
            <p>This they did by Encouraging a new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
to which his late Majeſty K. <hi>Cha.</hi> II.
and his Royal Brother then D. of <hi>York,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0523501200:5"/>
King of <hi>England,</hi> gave particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
Subſcrib'd a conſiderable
Stock, was pleas'd to grant a Royal Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Dated <hi>Anno</hi> 1672. from whence they
derive the Title of the <hi>Royal African Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
this is not repeated in Compliment
to the Company, but for the ſake of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the Story.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the Authority of their
New Foundation, and the Favour of their
Prince, which they had then to ſo great a
degree as above; yet ſuch was the Reſpect
had to the Neceſſity of Poſſeſſing the Coaſt
of <hi>Africa,</hi> by Forts and Caſtles, and the
Settlement of Factories, for the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Security of the Trade; ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
did it appear, that without theſe
Forts, Caſtles, and Settlements, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to carry on the Trade, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and enlarge it; that this New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were oblig'd to take off theſe Forts
and Caſtles, from the Hands of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that went before them.</p>
            <p>As the Neceſſity for having theſe Forts
and Caſtles for carrying on the War, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd,
ſo the Senſe of Juſtice to the Old
Company prevail'd; and tho' they were
not able to carry on the Trade, yet no
Thoughts were Entertain'd of taking away
their Property, without a valuable Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
ſuch a Barbarous Thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
entred into the Counſels of thoſe juſter
Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0523501200:6"/>
Nor were the Old Company in all their
moſt deſpicable Circumſtances, oblig'd to
part with them as Heaps of Materials, and
old Stuff for Building; the Price was not
run down as of old Houſes, to be Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd
and good for little, tho' they
were at that Time really in but a mean
Condition, of ſmall Strength, and no way
proportionable to what they are now, or
what the Security of the Trade call'd for.</p>
            <p>But they were conſider'd at a moderate
reaſonable Value between both, as Things
neceſſary to the New Company, and
that had been very chargeable to the
Old; uſeful for the Security of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and eſſential to the very Being and
Nature of the Thing: Thus the New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
came in upon a very fair Purchaſe,
and gave at firſt, in the very Infancy of the
Trade 34000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, for but one of
thoſe very Forts and Caſtles which are
ſince that made the Subject of ſome Peoples
Jeſt; and which <hi>firſt</hi> they would have be
thought of no Uſe to the Trade; but when
that was not to be made out, then they
would have it, that the Number was too
great, and the Value of them but a Trifle.</p>
            <p>This is the more needful to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
here, to give all Men leave to take
Notice of the remarkable Juſtice of the
preſent Separate Traders who oppoſe the
Company; who would not only have the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0523501200:7"/>
Company's Forts and Caſtles vallued at lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing, but would not have that
little paid them neither, but would have
them taken from them; either by dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
the Company of their Property upon
a pretended Aſſignment for Payment of
Debts, or which is equally juſt, would
have them put into the Hands of the
Government, without making any Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the preſent Company for them,
which is little better than endeavouring
to get an Act to make a General Plunder
of the Company's Effects.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all, but when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that the Government ſhould have
the Forts and Caſtles, their Juftice to the
Government was as Eminent as their Juſtice
to the Company, for they were not to
make any Settled Payment to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the Expence of Maintaining the
Garriſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Forts, except a
Certain Rate <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon an uncertain
Degree of Trade; for no Man was to
Export more than he pleaſed, or to pay
for more than he Exported. Theſe are
Speciments of the Juſtice of the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both the Company and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were to meet with with from theſe
Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Caſe in Hand. The
Company having obtain'd a Charter from
the Crown, and their Trade ſecur'd with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0523501200:8"/>
excluſive Privileges, ſuited to its Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at Home, and with Forts, Caſtles,
and Settlements, for its Defence Abroad,
went on proſperouſly for many Years.</p>
            <p>If any Perſons yet remain'd doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the Neceſſity and Advantage of
this Trade, or of the Magnitude it roſe to
under the Protection of the ſeveral Princes
aforeſaid, it might not be amiſs to enlarge
here, by telling them, What in the Space of
Twenty Years, or thereabout, they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures; How many
Negroes, they ſent to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies
in the <hi>Weſt Indies;</hi> and how many Thouſand,
Ounces of Gold they brought into <hi>England,</hi>
beſide the Export of Foreign Goods by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures,
and the Import of many Thouſand
Pounds <hi>Sterl.</hi> in Wax, Elephants Teeth, Drugs
and valuable Commodities, the Growth of
the Country there, and neceſſary to ours
here.</p>
            <p>We might tell you how, had this Trade
been neglected and left languiſhing, as it
has been ſince, under the Depredations of
Interlopers and Separate Traders, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of the War, and Loſſes at Sea; had
they been worryed, and kept in conſtant
Alarm by the Attacks and Barking of their
Rivals in the Trade, not a third Part of the
Poor had been employ'd, whom their Trade
kept Alive; not a third Part of the Negroes
had been carryed to <hi>America,</hi> tho' at double
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0523501200:9"/>
Price; and not a Tenth Part of the Gold
had been brought in to help our declining
Caſh to circulate, in a Time when a long
War had ſtopt the Channels of Bullion from
<hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe Things need not to be enlarg'd
on, they come within every Man's Reach;
and the moſt ignorant in Trade know them.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that the Proſperity of the
Company was ſuch, that they had very
little Debt upon them, an unlimited Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
a full Caſh, a vaſt Stock, and their
Actions run the higheſt upon a real Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
to ſupport them, of any Company that
ever was in <hi>England;</hi> being once Sold at Four
Hundred Pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> being the ſame
Thing that has ſince been Sold for Ten
Pounds, or very little more.</p>
            <p>This Remark is Needful to let the World
ſee, that the Great Debt upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
which the Separate Traders make
uſe of as an Argument, why they ſhould
be given up, is meerly occaſion'd by the
Convulſions of their Trade, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions
of thoſe very People that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain;
for that before there were any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telopers,
or that they went on with Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Company had no need to run
into Debt.</p>
            <p>It is true, That during the Reign of
thoſe very Princes, the juſt Protectors of
this Trade, ſome Attempts were made by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0523501200:10"/>
Interlopers and clandeſtine Traders, to
break in upon their Trade: And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſuffer'd always by thoſe Attempts, of
which large Accounts have already been
given by the Company in Print; but
their Right being clear, and that Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always ſupported by the Publick Good,
and the Juſtice of the Government, the
Company were enabled to do themſelves
Juſtice upon the ſaid Interlopers; and they
met with ſuch frequent Diſcouragements,
by the Legal Proſecutions of the Company
in Defence of Right, that the Interloping
Trade gain'd but little Ground of them
for many Years.</p>
            <p>It was very hard, that when the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
happen'd in <hi>England,</hi> which was
eſteem'd a general Deliverance of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Oppreſſion and Injuſtice, and
Men rejoyc'd every where for the more
free and Legal Poſſeſſion of their Rights
and Properties, that the <hi>African</hi> Company
ſhould be the Only Sufferer; the only Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that were left in a worſe Condition than
before; the only People that ſeem'd to have
leſs Security for the Poſſeſſion of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
and to feel more Oppreſſion than
they did before; and that they, of all the
Nation, ſhould have the true Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
at that Great Affair taken from 'em.</p>
            <p>But then it was, that from the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Year 1700, or thereabouts, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0523501200:11"/>
Interloper, as if the Liberty of doing Wrong
was reſtor'd among the other Freedoms of
the Nation, by the Revolution, began from
that Time to appear openly; Fit out Ships
here in the Face of Goverment; and appear
on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> in Defiance of the
Company's Forts, carrying on an open Trade
without Regard to the Laws of the Land
or the Lawful Privileges of the Company.</p>
            <p>It could not be, but that ſuch an Open
Invaſion of their Trade muſt be a great
Diſcouragement, as well as a great Loſs to
the Company: Eſpecially, conſidering
two great Things that attended it, 1. The
ſubtle but unfair and diſhonourable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
which theſe Interlopers took, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on their Trade to <hi>Africa.</hi> Such as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the Company's Officers and Factors
Abroad; confederating and correſponding
with the Company's Enemies in <hi>Africa,</hi>
whether Natives or <hi>Europeans;</hi> running
down the Price of their Goods to the
Negroes, teaching them the Craft and
Knowledge of the Trade, and how to Buy
and Sell to their Advantage; raiſing the
Rates of the Slaves they buy; and thus in
every Article rendring the Company's
Trade more difficult to manage, and leſs
profitable than it was before. 2. The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and, as it appear'd at laſt, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of obtaining Redreſs of theſe
Grievances, or Gaining any New Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0523501200:12"/>
of the excluſive Privileges, on the
Foot of which their Trade had flouriſh'd
for ſo many Years before.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo far was the Company from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Aſſiſtance at Home, againſt thoſe
People who daily made Havock of their
Trade, and grew Rich upon the Spoil of
the Company; that on the contrary, the
Impunity of the Times hardened the ſaid
Interlopers to go on, and claim that for a
Right, which they had nothing but their
own Practice to juſtify; as if the long break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in upon a legal Conſtitution had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
that Conſtitution of its Foundation.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things running to a height, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping
became Popular, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
had a juſt Alarm, from having ſeen
the Books for a New Subſcription to the
<hi>India</hi> Trade laid open, and the Interlopers
of that Trade Incorporated in a diſtinct
Society: Tho' the Neceſſity of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
into the Hands of the Old Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſoon brought them into a Coallition.
Of which by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>African</hi> Company were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
with this Precedent, if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
apprehenſive of the like Invaſion
of their Trade, and expected every Day
when their Interlopers would be alſo
Incorporated into a New Company: The
ſaid Interlopers themſelves deliver'd them
from that Fear when they ſoon let them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0523501200:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſee, that it was not the Setting up againſt
the Company, but an utter Diſſolution of
the Company, and laying open, <hi>Anglicè</hi>
blowing up the Trade, was in their
View.</p>
            <p>Not to enter into a Detail of their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
to this Purpoſe, which yet are many
and very viſible, the Variety of which
would very well bear a Hiſtory, and long
Accounts of which have been already
made Publick; it ſhall ſuffice to note,
that the Company languiſhing under the
Inſolence and Oppreſſion of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions,
and at the ſame time lying
under many diſcouraging Loſſes by the
War, reſolved (that they might rather
ſave the Trade to the Nation, than enjoy
the Profits of it) to take them into, what
they could not keep them out of; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grant ſomething upon Conditions of
ſaving the reſt, than ſee the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who in a ſhort time
would effectually deſtroy both.</p>
            <p>Upon this Principle the Company ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
themſelves to the Parliament about the
Year 1698, and obtained an Act to permit
all People who thought fit to Adventure,
to Trade to <hi>Africa,</hi> and from thence to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, paying only to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the rate of 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> beſides the
ordinary Duties to the Crown: Which Ten
<hi>per Cent.</hi> was of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0523501200:14"/>
Forts, Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for receiving the
Protection of them in their Trade.</p>
            <p>It would be worth while here, and in
the purſuit of theſe Papers We ſhall not fail,
in order to let indifferent People judge of
the Pretences on both ſides, to examine
the Dimenſions of the Trade, the Export
and Import from and to <hi>England,</hi> the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Negroes ſent to the Colonies in the
<hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and the Price which is given
there now for them; and comparing theſe
with the like Article of the Trade during
the Company's free Enjoyment of their
excluſive Privileges, draw a State of the
Difference; that it may be plain to every
Man's Eye, who are or are not the beſt
qualify'd to carry on this great and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
Trade for the Good of the Nation.
But We adjourn this for a little.</p>
            <p>The Act of Parliament for Granting this
Liberty of Commerce, upon the Payment
of the Sum aforeſaid, has done the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers
one Favour, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That it has le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimated
them under a New Name, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
the ſcandalous Title of Interlopers,
which are indeed but the Raparees or
Highway-men of Trade; They have chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
themſelves by the Name or Title of
10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Men, <hi>alias</hi> Separate Traders,
and by this new Dignity we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them.</p>
            <p>The Company, as it may well be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0523501200:15"/>
under the Torture of this growing
Evil, like a Body under the Weight of a
cruel and incurable Diſeaſe, has ſenſibly
waſted and decay'd, ſuffer'd innumerable
Inconveniences and Diſcouragements, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſink them far lower than they are
yet fallen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Decay of their Trade has
made the Charge of maintaining their Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
be an Article that has continually
fed upon their Dead Stock, and eaten long
upon their Capital; the Charge being the
ſame as when their Trade was moſt Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing;
the 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which was
allow'd them by Act of Parliament go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a very little way to defray the
Charge.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> As they have grown weaker and
leſs able to protect their Trade, ſo that
Weakneſs has happened at a time when
their Strength was moſt needful; having
not only the Natives on Shore to reſiſt,
but the Enemies of <hi>England</hi> to contend
with, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it is humbly noted, in behalf
of the Company, That their Forts
and Caſtles indeed were built for the
Defence and Protection of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
either againſt the Inſults of
the <hi>African</hi> Natives, or the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Trading Force of other
Nations; ſuch as the <hi>Dutch, French,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0523501200:16"/>
               <hi>Danes, Pruſſians</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> And
they are able and ſufficient to defend
themſelves and their Trade againſt
any or all of them, as Traders. But
it is own'd, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French,</hi>
or any other come to make War with
us, and ſend regular Forces, Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
and Armies, we are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for ſuch Work as that. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected, a private Society of
Merchants can be at an Expence for
it, or Maintain Garriſons to defend
ſuch Forts as might reſiſt in ſuch a
Caſe; nor could any of thoſe Nations
reſiſt ours in like Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>And therefore they have ſuffered irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Damage and Loſſes by the Attacks
which the <hi>French</hi> have made upon them
during this War; by which ſeveral of their
Forts and Settlements have been deſtry'd,
their Effects plundred, their Servants and
Factors carried away, and the Charges
laid out, as well as the Trade it ſelf, loſt
together.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> They have ſuſtained other Great
Loſſes, both at Sea and Land, unuſual;
and they believe to any Society of
Men in Trade, intollerable; ſuch as</p>
            <p>Taking their Ships by the Enemy,
the Hurricane at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> &amp;c.
the Deſcent of the <hi>French</hi> upon
the Iſlands of <hi>Mevis</hi> and St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0523501200:17"/>
and by Shipwreck; all which
put together, as they have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to the Government, amount to
above 400000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling.</p>
            <p>The Company's being reduc'd to great
Difficulties and Extremities under all this,
can be ſtrange to no Body; nor is it to be
wondred, that to keep themſelves up, and
to preſerve a Trade in it ſelf ſo benefical, in
hopes at one time or other to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the Favour and Aſſiſtance of the
Government, they have call'd in great
Sums of Money out of the private Eſtates
of the Adventurers; and owe great Sums
upon the Common Seal of their Company.
Of all which things the Separate Traders
make their preſent Advantage; as if the
Diſtreſſes and Difficulties the Company la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
under, were a good Reaſon why
there ſhould be no Company at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
were the Company ſet free from the
Aſſaults and Encroachments of theſe Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and reſtor'd to the legal Privileges
of their Charter, they would ſoon both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
themſelves by the Trade, and reſtore
the Trade to the Nation.</p>
            <p>If we were permitted to Argue for the
Company, by the uſual Topicks which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
things in other Caſes; the Heavy
Loſſes, the Difficulty and Diſſaſters, which
the Adventurers and Creditors have had in
all theſe Particulars; the ſeveral Sums of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0523501200:18"/>
Money call'd in, the long time they have
been out of both Principal and Intereſt,
would be of ſome weight to move thoſe in
whoſe Power it lies to re-eſtabliſh them,
that by a fair honeſt Application to the
Trade they might reſtore their Affairs and
make up their Loſſes again; Eſpecially
when the giving them ſuch Preferences,
conſiſts with the preſerving and ſecuring
the Trade, to the Advantage of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But on the contrary, the Clamours
of theſe People, have made the very Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of the Company Arguments to
ruin them; as if the Creditors of a Tradſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhould be excited to be more ſevere
upon him than they would be, becauſe he
has had his Houſe Burnt, or becauſe
Thieves have Broke up his Shop and
Robb'd him, which Diſtaſter would move
Men of Reaſon to Forbear and Encourage
him.</p>
            <p>But much ſtronger will this Argument
be, when it ſhall appear in the Company's
Favour, that private Intereſt, Plunder of
the Company's Effects, and violent taking
away the Property of other Men, appears
to be the chief View of the Separate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and that they are ſo far from aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Publick Advantage, by ſecuring
the Trade to the Nation, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they do not pretend to give, nor
are they able to offer any Security that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0523501200:19"/>
can be Depended upon to that purpoſe,
and by the Nature of the thing, it ſeems
morrally Impoſſible, but the Trade muſt
dye in their Hands, and be Irrecoverably
Loſt to the Nation.</p>
            <p>This ſhort Abſtract of the Company's
Affairs brings us down to the preſent
Times; and this is the true Deſign of
making it thus Public; alſo it gives any
one that pleaſes impartially to conſider it,
a clear View of the true Riſe and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Diſeaſes of the <hi>African</hi> Trade,
with the Capacity the Companies Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are in to hurt them, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
a View of the proper Remedy for
thoſe Diſaſters.</p>
            <p>From this brief Account alſo Anſwers
will indeed form themſelves to moſt of
the Cavils of the preſent Oppoſers of the
Company; as to the Uſefulneſs, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and the Right of Property which
the Company have in the Forts in <hi>Africa;</hi>
it will convince the impartial Reader,
as to the ſeveral Circumſtances of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and their Incapacity either to carry
on the Trade, or to ſatisfie their Creditors;
alſo as to the Nature of the Trade, and
whether laying it open, or limiting it, is the
beſt Method to preſerve it; of which the
Separate Traders themſelves have made
woful Experiments; and as to ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Objections, to which we ſhall ſpeak
their Turn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0523501200:20"/>
The Company languiſhing under theſe
Difficulties, finding it in vain to ſtruggle
any longer with their Misfortunes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to put it to the trial, whether they
or the Separate Traders had moſt Right
to, and the beſt Plea for the Trade; and
very loth both the Trade it ſelf ſhould ſink
and be loſt to the Nation, Humbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
themſelves to the Parliament in the
Year 1709. by their Petition ſetting forth
their Circumſtances, Praying a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of their Priviledges, and an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of their Company, as then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for a New Subſcription.</p>
            <p>In the Purſuit of this Petition, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
having referr'd it to a Committee of
the whole Houſe, and the Separate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
having alſo petition'd to be heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, ſeveral Hearings were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
on both Sides; wherein the Perſons
who appear'd for the Separate Traders,
treated the Company with all the Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Indecency that they could poſſibly
beftow, conſiſtent with the Place they were
in; bringing their own Servants to betray
the Secrets committed to them, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Pay and Employment; betraying the
Privacies of Converſation, and Letters of
Friendſhip; and all poſſible Methods were
us'd to blacken the Company's Proceedings
of which nothing more need be ſaid than,
this, That they had the full Satisfaction of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0523501200:21"/>
doing the Company's Reputation ſome
Harm, and convincing the World they had
no Regard at all to their own; ſome of
their Witneſſes not ſticking to own the
greateſt Villanies, upon a Suppoſition that
they ſhould have it believ'd, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
had approv'd of them, as done in
their Service. But failing in producing
either Authority from, or Approbation
of the Company in ſuch Things, they
effectually branded themſelves firſt, and
yet failed in the main Deſign of Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Maſters.</p>
            <p>The Pleadings, or rather Scoldings, on
both Sides being over, and the Separate
Traders having, as they thought, brought
their Buſineſs to an Iſſue; in the Midſt of
their Triumphs, they run themſelves upon
a Rock which ſplit their Cauſe; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Shipwreck'd to all Intents and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the Parliament broke up, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to do any thing for them, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
without their putting themſelves into
a Condition to make it poſſible for that
Parliament to do any thing for them, or
they to expect it; unleſs they had expected
the Houſe ſhould have acted againſt their
own Judgment, againſt the Senſe of the
People, againſt the Nature of the Thing,
and againſt the Intereſt of the Whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and thus like the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0523501200:22"/>
               <hi>Villa Vitioſa,</hi> they got the Victory, but
they loſt the Day.</p>
            <p>It is true nevertheleſs, that how much
Reproach ſoever their Cauſe obtain'd, and
how ill ſoever they lookt in the Eyes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Men; And tho' their Failing at
laſt overthrew them, and cauſed the Houſe
to drop their propoſed Chimaera of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and no Company, of which we may
ſpeak hereafter: Yet the Negative this
Delay gave the Company in their propos'd
Eſtabliſhment, left them and the Trade
with them in the ſame languiſhing Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they were in before, or rather worſe.</p>
            <p>The Rock which as is ſaid Shipwreckt
the whole Project, and in midſt of their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ſplit all their Cauſe, was this; the
Want of being able to propoſe a real and
ſubſtantial Security for the Preſervation of
the Trade, to the Nation. This was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to be neceſſary, as without which
the Houſe could not make any Thing that
was to be done for them rational: But when
all their Propoſals were lookt into, not the
Security it ſelf only was miſſing; but no
Foundation or poſſible Foot upon which
any ſuch Security could be form'd was to
be found; at which ſome of their beſt
Friends grew very much aſham'd of their
Cauſe, and appear'd no more in their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
for Fear of being oblig'd to bluſh for
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0523501200:23"/>
Nor was this Rock an Error of Pilotage,
which with better Conduct they might
have avoieed: It was not a Rock under
Water, or in the Dark: It was an open
Plain and Mountain-Difficulty. They ſaw
it clearly; every Body told them of it; the
publick Prints warn'd them of it; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Review</hi> banter'd them with it,
and challeng'd them to avoid it if they
could. But their Cauſe would ſteer no
other Courſe; it was built upon Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
hardly poſſible, and ſplit upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
hardly probable.</p>
            <p>And indeed the relating this Hiſtorically,
ſeems to be the moſt Convincing and the
Keeneſt way of Arguing that can be made
uſe of in this Caſe. The Company were ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
Caſt in their Cauſe, the Stream both
in the Houſe and elſewhere was againſt
them; the Separate Traders cry'd <hi>Victoria,</hi>
and thought the Day was their own: Why
did they not then obtain the Settlement
their own Way? Why did not the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
do the Work as they deſired? Why
were not the Schemes they offered put into
a Bill and brought to the Vote? The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was Plain, and will be a Reaſon for
ever, neither that Parliament did, nor
any Parliament with their Eyes open
ever can Eſtabliſh them, or ſet up the
Trade their Way, (Viz.) Becauſe they
propoſed no Foundation to make it ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0523501200:24"/>
no Subſtance to build on, nothing
that look'd like a Security for the Nation,
<hi>And why did they not?</hi> The Anſwer is Plain,
they did not becauſe they could not, the
Men were not Fools, but the Nature of the
thing would not bear it, the Propoſal had
nothing of that kind in it, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,—and
it is ſo ſtill, <hi>let them do it if they
can,</hi> and no Man can be ſo Unjuſt to any
Parliament as to think they will ever ſettle
the Trade without ſuch a Security.</p>
            <p>However this was, yet as above, it
the left Company's Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ineſs undone, and
their Affairs unſettl'd, a Thing, which,
as it was fatal to them, ſo it ſeem'd to
be the utmoſt that the other People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
as what they ſuppos'd would at
laſt be the Ruin of the Company, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Help: And no doubt they took
their Aim here much righter than they
did in any Thing elſe; ſome of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been heard to ſay, They car'd not
whether the Parliament did any Thing or
no, provided they did but delay the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
for then they knew the Thing would
fall into their Hands of Courſe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
not being able to ſtand of themſelves,
without ſome Act was paſſed in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
which they had nothing to do but to
prevent.</p>
            <p>It is true, This Proſpect ſeem'd more
rational to them at that Time, than it has
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0523501200:25"/>
done ſince; and they had but too much
Reaſon for that wicked Suggeſtion.</p>
            <p>The CASE was this:</p>
            <p>The Company had taken in Great Sums
of Money upon Bonds, under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Seal at Intereſt, after the Rate
of Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> the Whole amounting to
near 200000<hi>l.</hi> Several Propoſals for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
this Debt had been made by the
Company; all which, however well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were rendred Abortive by the Practices
of theſe People call'd Separate Traders; and
not only ſo, but many of them bought up
the Company's Bonds, that ſo becoming Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
they might both by the Authority
of their Bond, as well as Example, prevent
the Creditors coming into any ſuch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
however reaſonable.</p>
            <p>Several of theſe Bonds were put in Suit
againſt the Company, and ſome very hard
Things done on thoſe Heads, which we care
not to repeat, becauſe they may oblige us
to deſcend to Perſonal Reflections, which
ſhall be avoided as much as poſſible.</p>
            <p>By theſe Proſecutions the Company's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
were ſtill farther embarraſs'd, their
Commerce interrupted, their Ships ſtopt,
their Effects attach'd, and all poſſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
offer'd them upon every Occaſion, as
well to perplex and diſcourage them in their
Affairs as to run down their Credit, and in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0523501200:26"/>
the End oblige them to break up and
diſſolve.</p>
            <p>To counter-act theſe wicked Deſigns and
if poſſible to defeat them in their Grand
Hopes, the Company ſet on Foot ſeveral
Propoſals, at ſeveral Times, to their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</p>
            <p>1. A Propoſal of aſſigning over their
Forts, Factories, and Settlements, with
all their Quick and Dead Stock, into a
New Subſcription, at a certain Rate, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to have both the ſaid Stock and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
apply'd to the Payment of their
whole Debt, as well Principal as Intereſt.</p>
            <p>2. A Propoſal of a certain Majority of
their Creditors in Number and Value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impowered to accept ſuch Terms and
Propoſals as the Company ſhould make
for the Payment of their whole Debt with
Intereſt, and that the reſt ſhould be bound
by ſuch Agreement.</p>
            <p>3. A Coallition or Encorporation of
their Debts with the Stock of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
for the Carrying on the Trade: The
Conditions of thoſe Propoſals, Eſpecially
the laſt, were ſo fair, and the Deſign
ſo viſibly Honeſt; ſo Calculated for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the Creditors, and the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Trade together, that the
Town was for ſome time in hopes none
could have ſtood ſo much in their own
Light, as to have refuſed them, and a very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0523501200:27"/>
great Number of the Creditors came rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
into them.</p>
            <p>But it could not be Expected that the
Separate Traders, who were Creditors,
whether by real Original Loan, or Politick
Purchaſe as aforeſaid, and had another
Game to play, would comply with theſe
or any other Propoſals for the Preſervation
of that, which it was manifeſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to Deſtroy; and therefore the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in theſe Propoſals were many.—The
Separate Traders both openly, by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out themſelves in their Bond Capacity;
and underhand by their Private, but ſince
known Solicitations, uſed their utmoſt
Endeavours to prevent this Deſign, <hi>however
fair,</hi> coming to any Head.</p>
            <p>The Company finding that in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
their Affair in Parliament, was
like either to be delay'd, <hi>the Seſſion draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near a Cloſe,</hi> or to go againſt them
in the Houſe; Preſented a moſt Humble
Petition to the Houſe, tending to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of their Creditors, ſetting forth
the reaſonableneſs of Improving their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in the beſt manner poſſible for that
End, and Praying that what the Majority
in Number and Value of their Creditors,
might agree to, might bind the reſt; a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
granted to Private Traders, in caſe of
their Loſſes and Diſſaſters, and thought
to be much more Reaſonably expected here
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0523501200:28"/>
The Separate Traders on the other hand,
get ſome of themſelves, being Bond Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
as well as Separate Traders, to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt this, Praying to have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
Diveſted of their Eſtate in their Forts
and Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to have thoſe Forts
and Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Veſted in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
with Power to Sell them, towards
Satisfaction of their Debts.</p>
            <p>Theſe were certainly the firſt Creditors
that ever Petitioned that they might have
but part of their Debt, when they might
have had the whole; but the Deſign was
Evident, <hi>as for the Honeſty of it I ſhall let
that alone,</hi> (Viz.) that this was the only
Turn they could give to the Company, by
which they might come at what they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
(Viz.) a Poſſeſſion of the Forts and
Caſtles; for had theſe Gentlemen obtained
a Power to ſell the ſaid Forts and Caſtles,
as by ſuch an Act of Parliament would have
been given them, they had no more to do,
but to Sell them to themſelves at ſuch Sum
or Price, as they ſhould think fit, and the
Affair had been at an End.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not Venture to ſay, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
there was; as things run at that
time, of obtaining this Requeſt, however
hard and Unreaſonable. But the Seſſion
drawing to an End, there was no time left
for theſe things, and ſo the Parliament
broke up and nothing was done in it, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0523501200:29"/>
Company was left to ſtruggle with their
own Difficulties, and to languiſh another
Year in the Decay it was brought to, by
the Particulars aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Two Seſſions of Parliament paſt in this
manner, the Proceedings both of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the Separate Traders, and of the
Houſe being much the ſame, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
the ſame, (Viz.) leaving the
Trade unſettled and the Company weaker
and weaker, drawing on, as we may ſay, to
its Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>When the Company ſaw their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ſtill growing worſe and worſe, and
no viſible Proſpect of Relief, by their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to Parliament, they reſolve to try
if they could come to ſome tollerable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with their Creditors, that if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
they might put them in a way to be
paid, and at the ſame time to preſerve the
Trade; and this was by making the third
Propoſal mentioned, (Viz.) a Coallition
or Encorporating their Debt together with
the Stock of the Company; ſo that both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
making one new Fund, together
with ſuch Addition as was propoſed in the
Articles of Coallition for the carrying on
the Trade, and this upon the Foot of their
preſent Charter; that thus being at once free
from the Embarſſaments of their Debt, they
might carry on a clear Trade, the Profits
whereof in time, might be ſuppoſed to riſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0523501200:30"/>
high enough to Anſwer the ſaid Debt and
Stock, as if paid off by the Company.</p>
            <p>This New Birth ſuffered ſtrong Travel in
its bringing Forth, and all the laſt Year
was ſpent in vain to effect it; the Separate
Traders having done their utmoſt to render
it Abortive. But at laſt it has taken Effect
and appears Perfect. The Creditors have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Eyes open to their true Intereſt,
and beginning to ſee every Day plainer
than before the Deſtructive Deſigns of the
Separate Traders, who conſtantly oppoſed
every thing that might tend to the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Company's Affairs, and that
meerly as tending to ſuch Settlement.</p>
            <p>And now we ſee the Creditors and the
Company fully agreed, and joyning in
their Applications to the Parliament, for
Confirming their Agreement, and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
them as One Company, for the
carrying on the Trade. Now the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of Creditors is at an End; the Cry
that they cannot pay their Debts is Over;
They Owe nothing, for it is all put to one
Common-Stock, and Creditors and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,
make now One Company. What
the Separate Traders can now have to ſay
againſt it, what Pretenſions they can make
now to a Right in, or what Demands to a
Share of the Trade, ſeparate from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
what Security they can give for the
Preſervation of the Trade, if they had it;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0523501200:31"/>
What Aſſurances of Supplying the Colony's
with Negroes, and at what Price; what
Quantity of Manufactures they will Engage
to carry out of <hi>England,</hi> and what Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to Employ?</p>
            <p>Theſe all as material Articles for the
Proſperity of our General Commerce, and
for the Encouragement of our Plantations,
are very proper Queſtions to be ask'd
them, and no doubt will be ask'd of them
in the Houſe. If they appear then to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Company's Petition, what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
they give to them and what Deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
their Propoſals may have as to theſe
needful Queſtions, may be conſidered in a
Second Eſſay upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>In the mean time to finiſh this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and that the Gentlemen who are
now to take Cognizance of this Affair,
may have a true Notion of the Caſe, and a
full Knowledge of what has already paſs'd
thereupon, the following Obſervations,
'tis hoped may be uſefully enlarged upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is to be obſerved, that upon this
Agreement of the Company and their
Creditors, and their forming a Coallition
for the Carrying on the Trade; All Room
for Complaint againſt the Company, as
Bankrupt, and as having Drawn in Great
Sums of Money, and run into Debts they
are not able to Diſcharge, is removed;
and the Arguments Drawn from them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0523501200:32"/>
Turn'd with Advantage againſt the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Traders; and therefore the firſt ſtep
taken upon it, was to let the Government
know of this Coalition, which was done
by the Creditors Joyning with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in an Humble Petition to Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
fully ſetting forth their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as now United, and Humbly
Praying Her Majeſty's Gracious Aſſiſtance,
Encouragement and Protection, for the
Enjoyment of their Trade, Privileges and
Property, on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Together with this Petition, the ſaid
Company and their Creditors ſubjoyn'd a
Scheme or Propoſal, for ſecuring and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on the Trade, Exporting Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and ſupplying the Plantations with
Negroes; ſuch Security being as they
think Eſſential to the Trade of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
a Copy of the Scheme is as follows.</p>

Forts and Settlements on the Coaſt
are agreed to be abſolutely neceſſary, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
and improving that Trade, that the
moſt Effectual and Certain Method for Carrying
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0523501200:33"/>
on that Trade, for Purchaſing, Building,
Maintaining and Preſerving a ſufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Forts and Settlements, for receiving
Grants and making Agreements with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
for furniſhing the Plantations with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ſupplies of Negroes at moderate Prices,
for giving a neceſſary Credit to the Planters
and Contracting for the <hi>Aſſiento,</hi> or with the
<hi>Portugueze,</hi> can only be Effected by a Company

and other Merchandizes, to the
amount of One Hundred Thouſand Pounds
Sterling or upwards; and if it ſhall at any time
appear, by Application to Your Majeſty in

required to be ſent to the Plantations, the
Company may be ſubject to the Direction of
Your Majeſty in Council, to Export Annually
ſuch further Value in Goods and Merchandize,
as ſhall be judged neceſſary.</p>

to any Hands that could not give a

with an open Trade, in which every Man

                  <p>THE Lords commiſſioners of Trade and
Plantations, having under their Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
the Scheme propoſed by the Separate
Traders, for carrying on the Trade to <hi>Africa,</hi>

Separate Traders for their Anſwer Thereto;
I am directed to ſend you the Encloſed Copy of

3. What have you to ſay in Anſwer to what
is Objected, if the Trade be Open, and there
are ſeveral Sellers and Buyers of Goods from
<hi>Great Britain</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> that
thoſe Goods will be greatly Depreciated, and

               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>To theſe Queries the Company humbly
Preſented, by way of Anſwer, ſeveral
Heads of Obſervation, and then prepared to
Petition the Parliament once more, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to obtain ſuch an Act as may Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Unite the ſaid Company and Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and Confirm to them the Antient
Priviledges of their Charter, which Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is now depending before the Houſe, and
all the Reports and Proceedings of the
Lords Commiſſioners of Trade, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
relating thereto, are Ordered to be
laid before the Houſe.</p>
            <p>This ſhort Re-capitulation of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
ſeems to carry with it a clear Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>African Company,</hi> and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to all the Objections of their Enemies;
for it is obſervable, that in moſt Caſes
where Truth is on the Side, a clear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Matter of Fact is the beſt Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for Truth is always moſt clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
by it ſelf, and Hiſtory, rather than
Argument, pleads an Honeſt Cauſe beſt.</p>
            <p>The Impartial Reader therefore is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to the Matter of Fact, which is thus
faithfully related, and is made Judge of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0523501200:37"/>
the Merits of the Cauſe, by being made
Maſter of the Story. The Company ſeeks
no better Vindication than the Judgment
of Impartial Men, when thoſe Impartial
Men ſhall be rightly inform'd; and they
are perſwaded that moſt of the Gentlemen
in <hi>England,</hi> who have appear'd in their
Opinion againſt them, have done ſo more
for want of right Information, than any
other Defect.</p>
            <p>The Weakneſs of the Anſwers, the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and the Noiſe, which the Separate
Traders have made, tho' they may have
amuſed the World a little, have hitherto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to ſo little, that they have not
been able to obtain One Reſolution in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their particular Schemes; nor have
they been ever able to give One direct
Anſwer to the firſt Query before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> How they can ſecure the
Trade to this Kingdom, which all Sides
agree, muſt not be loſt?</p>
            <p>If, after this, they will proceed to oppoſe
ſuch clear Arguments, if they have any
thing to alledge againſt the preſerving the
Trade in a Company, and the paying Two
Thouſand Families of Creditors a juſt
Debt, many of whom wou'd be utterly
ruin'd in the Loſs. If they have any more
Suggeſtions, Poſſibilities and Probabilities
to offer, inſtead of real Securities, it's hoped
the Houſe will give them their due Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſince there ſeems nothing to be ask'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0523501200:38"/>
but this ſhort Queſtion, <hi>Who can ſecure
the Trade, and who cannot?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Queſtion the Separate Traders
could never yet be brought to ſpeak directly
to; in all their Anſwers, and in all their
Papers, they ſhift and ſhuffle it off, they
run out to Clamour at the Company, and
cry out of Monopoly; examine the Defect
of Exportations, and the Decay of the
Trade, and reflect upon the Companies
bad Succeſs; the Reaſons of which are all
in themſelves, as appears by what has been
ſaid. But not a word appears in all their
Papers given in, or in all their Pleadings
in the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> to ſecure the
Trade; all their Schemes are empty of
this main Point, tho' this is the only Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
upon which the whole matter turns.</p>
            <p>They have ſometimes mention'd it when
it has been put ſo cloſe to them that they
could no longer ſhift it off; and then they
tell the World, there is no doubt but the
Mony to be raiſed will be ſufficient; and
it is highly probable, and the like. But it
is humbly referr'd to all Impartial Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whether theſe are things for a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be ſatisfy'd with, and for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to grant an Eſtabliſhment upon?
Whether the Government in their juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
for the preſervation of the Trade,
ought to depend upon Probabilities and
Poſſibilities, without a real Security, in a
thing of this Conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0523501200:39"/>
All the Foundation upon which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Traders have ſuggeſted the Trade
ſhould be maintain'd, is, That it being left
Open and Free to all Men to Trade, the
Merchants will launch out into Trade, and
ſend a great number of Ships and Goods
every Year to <hi>Africa,</hi> out of which a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Mulct, or Fine, ſhall be laid to raiſe
Money for the ſupport of their Trade, and
maintaining ſuch Forts and Factories as
they think needful; and this they call a
Security, and indeed this is all the Security
they can propoſe.</p>
            <p>If then this Security be duly examin'd,
and the Uncertainties and Weakneſs of the
Pretences laid open, it cannot be doubted
but the Honourable Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who are not to be ſuppoſed eaſie
to be Impoſed upon, will ſee thro' the
Fallacy, and reject ſuch an Attempt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
the Nation, with the juſt Contempt
that it deſerves.</p>
            <p>To this End it is humbly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Honourable Houſe of Commons
to obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. It is ſuggeſted, the Merchants will
launch out into the Trade when it is laid
Open and Free; and as long as they can
carry it on to their Advantage, we may,
without prejudice to the Argument, grant
they will, or at leaſt may do ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0523501200:40"/>
But ſuppoſing, <hi>which alſo is very rational
to ſuppoſe,</hi> that a time may come when that
Gain may ſtop, or ceaſe for a Time: It is
evident to all Men, that the carrying on
the Trade will always depend upon the
Gain of the Trade; and if by the Accident
of War, any Invaſion from Neighbours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Difficulties with the Natives, or any
other contingent Caſualties, which that
Trade is ſubject to more than other Trades.
The Gain of the Trade ceaſes, <hi>the Trade
ceaſes of courſe;</hi> and if the Trade ceaſes,
or declines, the Tax to be raiſed for the
Maintenance of the Forts and Caſtles cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
or is proportionably reduc'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> As the Difficulties of the Trade
decreaſe, it is evident the Expence of thoſe
Forts and Caſtles, and Settlements always
encreaſe; the carrying on Wars with the
Natives, the Exorbitances of Preſents, and
Expences among ſuch of them as are to be
kept in Friendſhip, encreaſe. If then the
Expences encreaſe by the ſame Caſualty
that makes the Tax to maintain it decline;
It is a moſt rational Conſequence, that thoſe
two Circumſtances tend to a Diſſolution of
the Trade.</p>
            <p>2. It is ſuggeſted, that there is no doubt
but the Money to be raiſed, will exceed
the Charge of maintaing the Forts and
Caſtles.</p>
            <p>This has been ſo left to the uncertainty
of a looſe Aſſertion, that it ſeems to leave
the Caſe more to be doubted, and is a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0523501200:41"/>
meer begging the Queſtion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>For if no Man is bound to Trade to any
Sum, if no Man is oblig'd to Trade far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than he pleaſes, which is juſt as far as
his Profit invites; if that Profit ceaſes as
above, why ſhou'd we think the Man will
Trade? So that inſtead of not doubting but
the Trade will ſupport it ſelf, it is out of
doubt that it will not, in caſe of Accident
as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>3. As there is no Obligation to any Man
to Trade longer than Advantage prompts
him to it; ſo the Separate Traders never
yet offer'd, nor can they bring in a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men that would be perſonally bound,
<hi>even tho' the Advantages of the Trade ſhould
continue,</hi> that they would Trade to ſuch
or ſuch a degree. This leaves the Trade
in ſuch an Uncertainty, that no dependance
can be propoſed, either for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Manufactures, or the Supply of
<hi>Negroes</hi> to our Colonies. Nor is this an
Omiſſion of the Separate Traders; a thing
forgotten by them, or which they may
make up when it is demanded of them.
The Houſe may ſoon put them to the Teſt
in theſe things; they cannot bring a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men together that will be bound in
their ſeparate Capacities to do theſe things,
either to Trade at all, in caſe of Loſs, or
War, or to a certain degree in times of
Peace, and Currency of Commerce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0523501200:42"/>
If theſe things are ſo, it is humbly left
to any indifferent Judgement to obſerve,
upon what Foundation the Trade, if laid
Open, is like to ſtand. How the Nation
ſhall be Treated, if by any Accident of
War, or otherwiſe, the Traders ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
or diſcontinue their Exports; and
what Condition our Colonies ſhall be like

            <p>4. By the ſame Rule there can be no
Security obtain'd from theſe Free Traders,
as to the Quantity of Goods of the Growth
and Manufacture of <hi>Britain</hi> they will Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
or as to the Number of Negroes they
ſhall carry Yearly for the ſupply of our
Plantations. Upon both which Articles
the Uſefulneſs of the Trade does depend;
and which is ſtill more, they cannot eaſily
be brought to ſtated and certain Prices for
which thoſe Negroes ſhall be Deliver'd;
but as by their Means the Price of Negroes
has been brought from 20 to 40, and 45 <hi>l.
per</hi> Head, to the great Oppreſſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of the Plantations; ſo they
ſtill will be at Liberty by the Scarcity of
their Number, to Extort from the Planters
what Exorbitant Price they think fit.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo Evident, and have
appear'd hitherto ſo Unanſwerable, none
of the Separate Traders, in their Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Papers, having offer'd the leaſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Reply to them, that there ſeems
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0523501200:43"/>
no occaſion to enlarge upon them. Only
here it may not be amiſs to obſerve,</p>
            <p>That in a ſettled Excluſive Company, all
theſe Objections are fairly Anſwer'd; the
Difficulties of the other Trade are all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
here to a Certainty, and to a meer
Demonſtration. An Eſtabliſt'd Company
under Privileges and Charters, are Enabled
by their very Conſtitution, to bring all
theſe things to a Head.</p>
            <p>They Engage to ſupport the Factories
and Settlements; to Carry on the Trade,
whether Loſs or Gain; to Defend and
Maintain the Forts and Caſtles; and tho'
an Inverval of Trade, or Ceſſation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
for a Year or Years, were to happen,
they go on; Depending on being better
Gainers heareafter; if Twenty Thouſand
Pound Loſs falls at a time, they cannot be
Diſcourag'd; the Trade is ſure to be kept
up till better Times return; the Forts and
Caſtles, tho' Cut off from their Trade by
the Inſurrections and Wars with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
receive their Conſtant Support and
Supply. This has been the Company's
Caſe frequently, yet they have never A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
the Settlements; whereas, had
Free Traders been left to have Supported
them, they had long ago been Loſt and
Forſaken.</p>
            <p>The Company have often, in their
Schemes and Propoſals, offer'd, and they
now offer to give real and ſufficient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to the Nation to preſerve the Trade,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0523501200:44"/>
by obliging themſelves in the Forfeiture of
their Charter, or ſuch Penalties as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſhall think reaſonable, to carry
on the Trade, ſupport the Settlements, and
ſupply the Colonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have frequently offer'd to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Stipulations, for Exporting Yearly, a
certain and very conſiderable Quantity of
Manufactures of the Growth and Produce
of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and to ſupply the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
with a certain Number of Negroes;
and not only ſo, but to come to a Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Stated Price for the ſaid Negroes, as
well in Times of War as Peace; that ſo the
Colonies may not only be brought to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
as to the Number, but may be ſure
not to be Impoſed upon in Price.</p>
            <p>This very Part of their Propoſal ſeems
a direct Anſwer to Two Things, and after
what has been ſaid, it ſeems ſomething
Wonderful to ſee them Inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>1. The Pretence of a Monopoly: All
the Grievance of a Monopoly lies in the
Engroſſers of a Trade, being in a Condition
to Impoſe a Price upon either Buyer or
Seller; which in this Caſe is effectually
Anſwer'd; for if they are bound to Export
a certain Quantity of Manufactures, they
are under a Neceſſity of Buying, and ſo
cannot Command the Price of the Seller.</p>
            <p>If they are Ty'd to a Price of their
Negroes, they cannot Impoſe upon the
Market where they Sell; and ſo all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Monopoly ceaſes of Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0523501200:45"/>
And this ſeems to make the Petitions
from the Merchants and Planters of the
Colonies the more unaccountably ſtrange;
for tho' it is True, that the ſaid Petitions
are Sign'd by but few, and thoſe none of
the moſt Conſiderable of either Merchants
or Planters; yet that any ſhould be found
among thoſe who have an Intereſt in the
Colonies, who ſhou'd be ſo Weak thus to
Join in a Petition againſt themſelves, is
really one of the moſt unaccountable things
in the World.</p>
            <p>The Dearneſs of Negroes is their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and the Uncertainty of their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
For them then to Petition againſt a
Company who offers Security to bring in
their Full Number, and at ſuch Seaſons as
they ſhall propoſe, and to lower the Price
to ſuch a Reaſonable Rate as they ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to; and this in Behalf of a Set of
Men, who have not only been already the
Occaſion of their Scarcity, and of raiſing
the Prices, but in whoſe Schemes their
Supply, as well as the Price too, is ſtill left
Precarious and Uncertain.</p>
            <p>This is indeed the greateſt Diſcovery of
Infatuation that was ever ſeen in any thing
that bears the Title of a Merchant, and
makes it Edvident, that the power of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
may ſometimes prevail upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
to blind their Eyes againſt their own
Intereſt, and make them <hi>Felo deſe</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0523501200:46"/>
But this is indeed beſt Anſwered, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
to the Members in Parliament,
that this Blindneſs is not a Judgment from
Heaven, upon the whole Body of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Merchants in the Colonies; but
on the contrary, the Company have an
Humble Petition from the greateſt Part and
the moſt Conſiderable for Intereſt, of all the
Planters in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Houſe of Commons, humbly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Neceſſity of Eſtabliſhing the ſaid
Trade in an Excluſive Company, under ſuch
Limitations as ſhall be neceſſary, as being
the only way to ſecure and preſerve the ſaid
Trade to the Nation, and to reduce the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Rates of Negroes in the Colonies,
which is now impoſed upon them by the
Separate Traders.</p>
            <p>By all which Arguments it ſeems beyond
Contradiction, that the only way to ſecure
and preſerve this Beneficial Trade to this
Nation, is to ſettle it upon a firm Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in a Company with Excluſive Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and yet to have thoſe Excluſive
Priviledges under ſuch Limitations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations
as may remove all the Scandal
and Suggeſtions of Monopolies, Engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
and Unfair Trading; that the Trade
may be once more reſtor'd to its former
flouriſhing Circumſtances, and both the
Nation at home and the Colonies abroad,
may be made Eaſy and be Gainers by the
Trade, which can never be as it now ſtands.</p>
