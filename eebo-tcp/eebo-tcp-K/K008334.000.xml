            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PUBLICK.</head>
            <p>FRIENDSHIP, and perhaps Gratitude, having incited the late Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> in his laſt Illneſs, to order his Book of Medicinal Secrets to be delivered to me, as my Property, in caſe of his Death, I ſhould think myſelf unworthy of a Bequeſt of this Nature, and made upon ſuch Honourable Principles, if I was not diſpoſed to apply it to the Nobleſt of all Purpoſes, <hi>The Common Good of Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the firſt Impreſſion I felt, upon the Information I received, of my being made Maſter of this Book, (valuable for its Contents) although I underſtood it to be given to me, as it certainly was, in the moſt Liberal Manner; to be abſolutely at my own Diſpoſal; and without Condition, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or Limitation of any kind whatever.</p>
            <p>Many and various have been the Thoughts which have occurred to me, and the Opinions I have heard, as to the Beſt Method to be taken in order to anſwer the Great End I wiſhed to accompliſh: And many were the Difficulties which preſented themſelves, and encountered the Idea of Diſpenſing the Principal Medicines made uſe of by Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> under the Direction of a Regularly bred Phyſician, of known Honour and Integrity; as well as That of throwing them open to the World; taking Care,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0648900800:3"/>at the ſame time, to have the ſaid Medicines duly prepared, in the ſame manner they uſed to be, and Publickly ſold, at Prices ſo moderate, that the loweſt of his Majeſty's induſtrious Subjects may have the Benefit of them.</p>
            <p>However, as I was inclined to allow Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Executors a Reaſonable Time to diſpoſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Medicines, which became their Property; I had thereby Leiſure to deliberate upon theſe two Principal Propoſitions. The latter of the two I always ſtood moſt inclined to adopt.</p>
            <p>But vain would have been my Inclination in this Particular, had not His Majeſty's moſt Benevolent Diſpoſition and Extenſive Bounty removed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable Obſtacle which ſtood in my Way; by making ample Proviſion for certain Ingenious Chymiſts, who had been employed by Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> the Moment it came to be Humbly repreſented to Him.</p>
            <p>By His Majeſty's Royal Bounty, then, theſe Men were made willing to give me that Aſſiſtance, which I could not, in Conſcience, have otherwiſe aſked or expected from them; as it would have been injurious to themſelves; and without which I could not have made all theſe Medicines known to the World, on account of certain Omiſſions and Inaccuracies diſcovered, upon Examination, in the Book: Since none, but ſuch as have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making the Chymical Medicines, could give a Clear and Perfect Account of the Proceſſes which had been actually uſed in the preparing of them.</p>
            <p>Having preſumed to ſuppoſe that what I have, by His Majeſty's Bounty, been enabled to do; and am now, in conſequence thereof, going to do, will prove Beneficial to Mankind in general, it may be thought rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onable that I ſhould inform the Publick
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0648900800:4"/>upon what Foundation I raiſe my Expectation of ſeeing ſo happy an Effect reſulting from it.</p>
            <p>It is, ſhortly, this. I knew the late Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> before he began to adminiſter Medicines; and, when he did, I reſided there for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Time, at different Periods. I had attention to the Operation and Effects of them there; as well as here, when their Reputation had opened his Way to his Native Country.</p>
            <p>I took his Emetic Drop and Sweats myſelf, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Thirty Years ago; and at a time when I was reduced (by a Complication of Diſorders, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my Stomach having loſt the Power of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting</hi> properly the moſt ſimple Food) to ſo low and wretched a State, both in Body and Spirits, that thoſe who were ſuppoſed to underſtand moſt, and knew me beſt, looked upon me as paſt all Hope of Recovery.</p>
            <p>To the Uſe of theſe Medicines, under God, I always thought I owed the happy Removal of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all my Diſorders. I have often given them, with Succeſs, in my own Family; and, at times, to that part of it which ſat neareſt my Heart: I have encouraged many to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> in very ſtrong Caſes: I have diſtributed his Medicines to the Afflicted, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſorders, which he uſed to give me for that Purpoſe: And I can wind up all I have ſaid upon this Head with averring to the Publick, that I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf never, as far as I can recollect, knew any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, excepting one<note n="*" place="bottom">The Perſon here referred to, had great Pains in the Body; and took Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Sweating Powders Thirty-two ſucceſſive Nights; taking ſometimes half, ſometimes three Quarters of a Doſe, which brought on a Weakneſs, of which this Perſon complained: But this ſeems to have been owing to the Quantity of theſe Powders, taken in ſo ſhort a time, and not to their Quality.</note>, who thought himſelf hurt by taking, or diſſatisfied for having taken Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0648900800:5"/>Medicines; on the contrary, I have known many Great, and Radical Cures effected upon thoſe of my Acquaintance who have taken them, in the Space of more than Thirty Years; and that, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the <hi>Medicines for their Manner of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I have ſaid this, no one will wonder that I not only hope, but preſume to expect that the Publication of theſe Medicines, and cauſing them to be ſold at very low Prices, will prove Beneficial to Mankind; whatever ſome may think, whoſe Minds remain warped by Prejudice; or others may ſay, whoſe Intereſt, perhaps, may have prompted them to infuſe thoſe Prejudices.</p>
            <p>To the former of theſe I cannot help ſaying, I ſhould wonder extremely (if Time and Obſervation had not ſhewed me the great Force of Prejudice) that any ſtrong Suſpicion ſhould ſtill remain of theſe Medicines being Dangerous, when taken in proper Quantities, and under proper Regulations, now that all the World knows they have been gaining Ground and Reputation for ſo many Years, only by the Force of their own Acts; notwithſtanding they had to break their way through the ſtrong Barriers of Intereſt, Prejudice and Ridicule.</p>
            <p>To the latter I ſhall only ſay, that the Medicines I am <hi>now</hi> going to make Publick are ſuch as have been moſtly applied to Caſes called Chronical; and, generally, to ſuch as were of Old-ſtanding, before the Sufferers under them would conſult Mr. <hi>Ward:</hi> And if, in the ſame ſort of Caſes, they ſhould hereafter be taken, <hi>without waiting ſo long,</hi> I hope the Gentlemen of the Faculty, eſpecially the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and Reſpectable, will not ſet up an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to them, and endeavour to diſcourage the Middling and Lower Sort of People from taking what will coſt ſo little, and probably do them a great deal of Good.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0648900800:6"/>
            <p>In this reaſonable Hope, I flatter myſelf I ſhall not be diſappointed: Yet, if that ſhould happen to be the Caſe, I ſhall be ſure of their Approbation for one certain Effect of this Publication; (and which, indeed, was a great Motive to it) ſuppreſſing the Practice of Ignorant Pretenders to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s <hi>Secrets;</hi> and thereby prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miſchiefs which would otherwiſe be done by ſuch Bold Practitioners diſpenſing, under the Name of theſe Excellent Medicines—One knows not What.</p>
            <p>I ſhall trouble the Publick no farther, now, upon this Subject, in general; but proceed to give the Genuine Receipts for making each Particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; ſpecifying the Doſes, and the ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders to which they have been uſually applied, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Obſervation, and the beſt Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have been yet able to obtain.</p>
            <div type="recipe">
               <head>Method of preparing Antimony, for the PILL and DROP.</head>
               <p>PROVIDE yourſelf with an Earthen un-glazed Pan, that will hold three or four Quarts; ſet it on a naked Fire, and have in readineſs, of the fineſt and pureſt crude Antimony, as much as you pleaſe; (that which appears in long ſhining Needles, and is the eaſieſt powdered, is the beſt; being moſt free from metallic, or other heterogeneous Bodies) pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it indifferently fine; put ten or twelve Ounces into your Pan, ſtirring it continually with an Iron Spatula, and increaſing your Fire till it ſends forth white Fumes, and a Flame like burning Brimſtone: Continue that Degree of Fire, continually ſtirring, till it burns or fumes no more; but is become a grey or aſh-coloured Powder. If it ſhould melt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0648900800:7"/>and run into Lumps, in the Beginning of your Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you muſt take it out of your Pan, and pound it again; putting it in again, and ſtirring as before, till it be thoroughly calcined. Then put in four Ounces more of your crude Matter; proceeding as before, and continuing ſo to do, till you have as much as you deſire. By this Method you will cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine your Antimony with much leſs Labour and Time, than in doing it all together, as is uſual: For, by putting your crude Antimony to your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, its melting will be prevented, and the Fumes will fly off much ſooner.</p>
               <p>[<hi>N. B.</hi> It muſt be done in a Chimney; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Fumes will be hurtful to the Operator.]</p>
               <p>Take a clean Crucible, which will hold about a Quart; put into it about two Pounds of your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined Antimony; ſet it in a melting Furnace, and make a gradual Fire under it; put Coals nearly to the Top of your Crucible; keep it in a moderate Fuſion, ſometimes ſtirring it about with an Iron Rod: Care muſt be taken that your Fire be not too violent, while your Matter is in Fuſion; or it will liquify it to ſuch a Degree, and render it ſo ſubtle, that it will all run through the Pores of your Crucible, into your Aſh-hole; not leaving one ſingle Drop, or Grain behind.</p>
               <p>When you find your Matter, which adheres to your Rod, tranſparent and bright (which it will be, in about half an Hour after it is in Fuſion, if you have kept a proper Degree of Fire) have, in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a ſmooth Marble Stone, well dried, and heated as hot as you can bear your Hand upon it; for fear your hot Matter ſhould break it. [It will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to have an Iron Curb round your Marble, to riſe half or three Quarters of an Inch above its Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, to prevent your Matter from running off.] Pour your vitrified Matter upon your Stone; and if you have any more of your calcined Matter, put
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0648900800:8"/>your Crucible again into the Fire; put in more, and proceed as before. If your Crucible is good, and your Fire moderately governed, you may uſe the ſame Crucible five or ſix times; as I, myſelf, have frequently done</p>
               <p>Thus have you <hi>a fair and pure Glaſs of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> of a light red Colour.</p>
               <p>As I have been informed that moſt, if not all the Glaſs of Antimony, uſed in this kingdom, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; and that the erroneous Proceſs, in making it, is alſo introduced here; I ſhall make the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obſervation upon it.</p>
               <p>As the Glaſs of Antimony, uſed here, is made abroad, we cannot be competent Judges whether it is made of pure Antimony, or ſuch as may be mixt with other heterogeneous Matter. I have alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that keeping the Crucible covered, during the time of its Fuſion, both hinders the Vitrification, and makes the Glaſs leſs pure, by preventing the remaining combuſtible Parts of the Antimony from flying off.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="recipe">
               <head>The <hi>Pill and Drop</hi> are made as follows.</head>
               <p>TAKE, of the aforeſaid Glaſs of Antimony, as much as you pleaſe; Pound it in a clean Iron Mortar, and ſift it through a fine Lawn Sieve; then grind, or levigate it, on a ſmooth Marble Stone, to an impalpable Powder. Take alſo Dragon's Blood, dried and powdered. To four Ounces of your levigated Glaſs, put one Ounce of this Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon's Blood; grind them very well together; and with good Sack, or rich Mountain Wine, make into a Maſs for Pills, of about One Grain and half each, which is a full Doſe for a Man or Woman.</p>
               <p>The Drop, ſo called, is made by putting about half an Ounce of your levigated Glaſs of Antimony into a Quart of the richeſt <hi>Malaga</hi> Mountain, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0648900800:9"/>Sack. Shake them well together, and let them ſtand two or three Days to ſettle, and grow clear. Then pour it off gently, to be quite fine.</p>
               <p>The full Doſe (half an Ounce) is for a Man, or Woman: But beſt to begin with the half or two thirds; according to Age or Strength of Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>Common Glaſs of Antimony, as ſold at the Shops, though reckoned a very rough Medicine, is, I find, preſcribed in Diſpenſatories from Two to Eight Grains: Therefore I ſhall make the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As I have made large Quantities of Glaſs of Antimony, for Mr. <hi>Ward;</hi> ſo I find a very eſſential Difference between what I made by the foregoing Proceſs, and what I have bought in the Shops: Mine being of a brighter Red, much ſofter, and not ſo harſh and gritty in the Pulveriſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Levigation: Whence I imagine, that the Glaſs of Antimony <hi>imported,</hi> is not prepared from <hi>pure Antimony,</hi> or <hi>not genuinely prepared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I apprehend that, where it has been preſcribed, and given inwardly, it has only been powdered and ſifted; whereby it is not reduced to the Hundredth Part of the <hi>Fineneſs</hi> to which it is brought by the aforeſaid <hi>Levigation,</hi> if duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Pill and Drop were the two firſt Medicines which Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> adminiſtred at <hi>Paris;</hi> and were, to the beſt of my Remembrance, the Principal Things made uſe of, when he firſt returned from thence to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were in 1736, attacked in a Printed Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, by Mr. <hi>Joſ Clutton,</hi> Apothecary and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt; who, <hi>being honeſtly concerned for the Publick Good</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Preface, Pag. 3.</note>, told the World he had diſcovered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent Parts of the Pill to be <hi>Red Arſenic and Glaſs of Antimony, equal Parts; with about one ſixteenth Part of Calcined Cobalt</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Pamphlet, Pag. 108.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he pretended to have proved, with ſo much Plauſibility; and reaſoned upon the <hi>ſuppoſed Proof</hi> with ſo much real Art, and ſeeming Sincerity, that he had well nigh ſunk the Credit of theſe Medicines: For Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> could only <hi>deny</hi> what was <hi>averred</hi> upon pretended Chymical Demonſtration; unleſs he would have declared his Secret; which was, at once, depriving himſelf of all future Benefit from it, as this <hi>Candid</hi> Writer well knew.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, Truth prevails, as it generally does ſooner or later: And it is now known to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that there was neither the leaſt Particle of Arſenic nor Cobalt in the Compoſition of theſe Medicines, which I have ſo often ſeen taken, with ſuch ſurpriſing Succeſs, in various Caſes, that I am
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0648900800:11"/>convinced Glaſs of Antimony, duly prepared, and given in proper Quantities, will often prove a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in Caſes which may baffle the Skill of the ableſt Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I hope thoſe Gentlemen will pardon my Preſumption, if I venture to recommend it to their ſerious Attention, and wiſh them to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments upon ſome of their Hoſpital Patients, in deſperate and perplexing Caſes.</p>
                  <p>To encourage them thereto, and farther to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for the Liberty I have taken, I proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the following Facts.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1733, being then in the Country with my Family, my Houſekeeper, from forty to fifty Years of Age, had long complained of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, Reachings, at ſome times Sickneſs, and at others Pains in her Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which ſhe took the uſual Remedies, and was ſometimes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſometimes worſe, for what ſhe took; but the greateſt Relief ſhe found, from the beſt Advice to be had at <hi>Newbury,</hi> was very tranſient; and her Diſorder increaſed until ſhe became, as they call it, <hi>very bad indeed.</hi> This inclined her to venture upon One of Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Pills; which had no other Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than that of a <hi>Vomit;</hi> and, by clearing her Stomach, ſeemed to have wrought a perfect Cure. However I remember that I adviſed her to take a ſecond Pill, in about a Fortnight or three Weeks. It did not operate near ſo much as the firſt, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Matter being greatly diminiſhed, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iſhed the Cure: For ſhe lived with me ſeveral Years afterwards, without any Complaints of that Nature.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, a Man-Servant of mine had frequent Complaints in his Bowels; to which, he ſaid, he had been long ſubject. At length he grew very ill, the Paſſages ſeeming to be obſtructed, and he was diſtreſſed for want of a Stool. Under
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0648900800:12"/>theſe Circumſtances, I gave him one of theſe Pills, which very ſoon relieved him; for it moved him <hi>downwards,</hi> and carried off his Pains. I do not remember to have heard him complain, during ſome Months, which he afterwards remained in my Service.</p>
                  <p>The Third, and laſt Caſe I ſhall mention, is that of a woman-Servant, at the ſame time in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. She was confined to her Bed, by violent Rheumatick Pains all over her body. I gave her this Pill, having before ſeen very extraordinary good Effects from it, in Rheumatick Caſes. It cauſed her to <hi>ſweat</hi> profuſely, for ſeveral Hours; during which time ſhe ſaid ſhe felt little Workings in the Leg moſt affected; and, in a few Days, ſhe was able to do her Buſineſs about the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>I mention theſe three Particular Caſes, only to ſhew, that, in my own Houſe, and in a very ſhort Space of Time, this Pill cured three People of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints very different in their Nature, by as many different, though proper Operations. From whence, and other Inſtances, which I have ſeen, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, that the Nature of Antimony, thus prepared, is to work ſafely upon vicious Humours in the Body; to carry them off by the proper Channels; and to remove Obſtructions, in ſome Degree, if not totally, wherever it meets with them. But if it meets with neither Obſtructions to remove, nor bad Humours to work upon, it paſſes quietly through the Body, without giving it the leaſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance; as I have known it do, in the Shape of theſe Pills, after taking three or four of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Month; and even the firſt time when taken, by a Perſon in perfect Health; which Fact I ſaw verified, by a Gentleman who took one of them in Contempt of its Size<note n="*" place="bottom">There are few Medicines which will bear the Change of Climate, the Damps and Cloſeneſs of a Ship in long Voyages: Whereas theſe Pills neither ſuffer by Time, nor thoſe Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and there is ſcarce a Remedy applicable to ſo many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; as is ſufficiently evinced by the Caſes above-mentioned; At the ſame Time that the Cheapneſs of them will render an Experiment very eaſy, to Seafaring Men.</note>.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0648900800:13"/>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, (to deal Candidly, in all Reſpects) I muſt confeſs that it is not adviſeable, according to my Information, to adminſter theſe Pills in Caſes wherein the Viſcera or Inwards are judged to be unfound.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid a great deal upon theſe Pills; and more, perhaps, than may be thought Prudent, tho' True: But as my View is, what I at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, to promote the common Good of Mankind; the Object is too great, and I am too much in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in the Purſuit, to ſuppreſs Truth; or my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, founded upon Truth; although the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious may impeach my Underſtanding; and the Intereſted may Ridicule it.</p>
                  <p>The DROP, ſo called, (though not with ſtrict Propriety, as appears from the Manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it) has been uſually given in Diſorders oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by foul Stomachs, and Indigeſtion. It generally operates as an Emetick, as it did with me; yet, ſometimes, it moves both ways; as does the Pill. They both make the Patient Sick, very much like Sea-Sickneſs, for a ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diſcharge, if <hi>upwards,</hi> and the Stomach be loaded with a great quantity of very foul Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but not otherwiſe. If the Stomach be thus foul, the putting the Matter into Motion muſt Occaſion Sickneſs, in proportion to its Quantity, and Quality; but it came from me, and I have ſeen it do the ſame in Others, with more Eaſe, and leſs Straining than is oceaſioned by the Emeticks uſually given.</p>
                  <p>With this Medicine it is not neceſſary to drink large Quantities, to Gorge the Stomach. Half a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0648900800:14"/>Pint of Warm Water, or thin Gruel, when the Sickneſs comes on, may generally ſuffice. When that is come away, and the Reaching over, for that time; half a Pint more may be taken; going on thus, till the Sickneſs returns no more.</p>
                  <p>I have taken about three of theſe Emetick Drops, treating them in the Manner above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and don't remember that any of them worked more than ſix times; not always ſo often; yet they may work oftener, where the Peccant Matter, to be brought away, is more Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
                  <p>The full Doſe, in which it will be made up and ſold, is for a Man, or Woman.</p>
                  <p>For young Perſons, it muſt be proportioned to the reſpective Age and Strength of each Individual. Even full Grown People, if of Weakly Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may abate of the full Quantity, for the firſt Time, at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>The chief Object before me in Publiſhing theſe Receipts, being, as I have ſaid, Promoting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good of Mankind; I ſhould act very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with that Profeſſion, if I was not explicit upon this Important Subject.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Principle, I think myſelf obliged to inform the Publick that the Book, left me by the late Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> (ſuppoſed to contain full and clear Receipts for preparing <hi>all</hi> the Medicines he made Uſe of) does not, upon Examination, fully anſwer that End.</p>
                  <p>What the Omiſſions and Inaccuracies are to be imputed to, I am not able to determine. All I know is, that ſome few Receipts are not yet found in this Book; and ſome Alterations, if not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, appear in the Entry of Others. However, by the Help of the Chymiſts employed by Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and other Information, I have been enabled
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0648900800:15"/>to get thoſe Defects ſupplied and rectified, to my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; as far as this Publication extends.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that the Receipts for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the two Original Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pill and Drop, are as yet no where diſcovered in the Book: But Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> has owned to me, that the principal Ingredient in them is <hi>Antimony,</hi> prepared in a particular manner: Every Circumſtance attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Operation, I am told, confirms it; and Mr. <hi>White</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>White</hi> is the Ingenious Chymiſt, who carried on the Great Vitriol Works, at <hi>Twickenbam,</hi> for Mr. <hi>Ward;</hi> and was employed by him in other Chymical Preparations.</note>, (perſuaded that <hi>Glaſs of Antimony,</hi> prepared by him, for Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> was the <hi>Eſſential</hi> Ingredient made uſe of in theſe Medicines) aſſures me, that he has long made and adminiſtered them in his Family, &amp;c. and upon a Compariſon as well of their Operation, as Analization, he found them, at that time, to anſwer exactly to thoſe made by Mr. <hi>Ward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For theſe Reaſons, and Others which I forbear to mention, I have no Doubt that the above Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts point at the Genuine and Beſt Manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Pill and Drop.</p>

               <p>POUND and bruiſe fourteen Pounds of the Cleaneſt Copperas into a Rough Powder; then dry it, with a very gentle Heat, ſpreading it thin, till it becomes a dry and ſubtile Powder, to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance like Quick Lime, only much Whiter. [Care muſt be taken, at the Beginning of the drying, that the Heat be very moderate; otherwiſe it will melt, and ſhut up the Pores of the Copperas, and greatly injure your future Operation.]</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0648900800:16"/>
               <p>When your Copperas is thus become dry and ſubtle (which may be done in about 6 or 7 Days) weigh it, and take an equal Quantity of good and clean Rough Nitre, or Salt Petre, which let alſo be tolerably dry. Pound your Nitre and dried Copperas together, and ſift them through an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently fine Hair Sieve: Then put them into a large Glaſs Retort, coated at the Bottom, and ſet it in a Sand Furnace: Let not your Retort be above an Inch from the Bottom and Sides of your Sand-Pan: Fix on a very large Receiver, and lute it; but leave a ſmall Vent-hole in the Joint, by ſticking in the Point of a ſmall Skewer, to let out the Wind, (which will iſſue from the Matter at the firſt making of your Fire) by drawing it out, and putting it in as you ſhall ſee Occaſion, to prevent your Retort or Receiver's burſting. Make a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fire for the firſt three or four Hours; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, gradually, for four Hours longer, till your Iron Pan be Red at Bottom: Continue your Fire for about thirty Hours; then let it out, and when all is cool, you will have a moſt powerful <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> Put it into a Bottle, and ſtop it cloſe: let it ſtand ſix or eight Days (the longer the better) to digeſt itſelf.</p>
               <p>Put this <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> into a Glaſs Retort; let it be about half, or two Thirds full; ſet it in your Sand-heat, and fix on a Receiver, which need not be very large: Make an indifferent Fire, till all your <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> is come over into your Receiver; leaving behind only a Brown Reddiſh Earth, which was forced over, by the Violence of the Fire, in the firſt Diſtillation. Thus have you a moſt ſtrong and pure <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[As I have never been able to procure any <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> proper for making the ſaid Drops, but what I made myſelf; I have here ſet down a true and full Proceſs for making it.]</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0648900800:17"/>
               <p>Take of your rectified <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> as much as you pleaſe; put it into a large Bolt-head, with a long Neck, but not above a Quarter full. Then take, of the pureſt and fineſt Volatile Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, in which there is not the leaſt Acid Salt, or Lime.</p>
               <p>[As I have uſually bought this Volatile Salt ready made, and doubt not but it may be had pure and genuine at Apothecary's Hall, I have omitted here ſetting down the Proceſs for making it; having bought it of Mr. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Chymiſt.]</p>
               <p>To ſixteen Ounces of the aforeſaid <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> in your Bolt-head, take ſeven Ounces of the ſaid Volatile Sal Armoniac; and, by half an Ounce at a time, put it into your Bolt-head, to your <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> immediately ſtopping the Mouth of your Bolt-head, till the Fermentation is over; yet not ſo cloſe, but to leave ſome ſmall Vent, for fear the Wind, cauſed by the violent Fermentation, ſhould burſt your Glaſs. When all your Sal Armoniac is in, let it ſtand two or three Hours, till the Fumes are ſettled.</p>
               <p>☞ [N. B. This is the Right and exact Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if your Operations in making your <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> are rightly performed; and your <hi>Volatil Sal Armoniac</hi> be good and pure.]</p>
               <p>Now put it into a ſmaller Bolt-head, half full, and ſet it in a moderate Sand-heat; when it is warm, put in four Ounces of the fineſt <hi>Quickſilver</hi> to each Pound (of ſixteen Ounces) of your Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and let it ſtand, in that Heat, till all the <hi>Quickſilver</hi> is diſſolved. Increaſe your Fire a little, and put in a ſmall Quantity more of <hi>Quickſilver;</hi> thus letting it diſſolve, by gentle Additions, as much as it will. When it will diſſolve no more, take it out of the Bolt-head, put it into an open Glaſs Veſſel, or a large White Stone Bowl. [I ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally cut off a large Glaſs Body in the Middle.]
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0648900800:18"/>Set it in a Moderate Sand-heat, and let it evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate till a Pellicle or Skin comes over the Top of it. Then take it from the Fire, and let it ſtand in a cool Place to congeal. [Great Care muſt be taken, that your Heat be not too great in your Evaporation; nor continued too long; or it would coagulate, and mix the corroſive Oil (which is to be poured off after its Congealment) with the fine pure Salt; and quite ſpoil the Medicine.]</p>
               <p>There will remain, uncongealed, a Heavy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or Oil, which pour off, and let it drain, until no more will run or drop from it. Take the remaining Salt, put it into a Glaſs Body, and to each Pound (ſixteen Ounces) put Three Pounds of the fineſt Roſe Water; ſtopping the Mouth of your Body, by tying over it a Piece of doubled brown Paper. Set it again in your Sand-heat; make an indifferently hot Fire, till all your Salt is diſſolved; which is uſually done in 24 Hours.</p>
               <p>Thus the WHITE DROP is prepared.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This WHITE DROP was wholly and conſtantly prepared by Mr. <hi>White,</hi> for Mr. <hi>Ward.</hi> I, who am neither Chymiſt nor Phyſician, do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay any Thing as to the Nature of this excellent Antiſcorbutic Medicine; and, therefore, ſhall confine myſelf, merely, to its Effects; which,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0648900800:19"/>under my Eye, have been very Extraordinary, in the ſeveral Stages of that Diſtemper; and, even, where the Patients have been ſuppoſed to derive their Diſorders from their Parents.</p>
                  <p>This being the Caſe; and, as I am thoroughly convinced that theſe Drops are a moſt Excellent, perhaps the greateſt known Antiſcorbutick, and beſt Purifier of the Blood; ſo, I cannot help flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering myſelf with a Hope, that they would be a great Preſervative againſt that fatal Diſtemper, which deſtroys, in a Year, ſo many of our brave Seamen; and often occaſions National Loſſes and Diſappointments, in the moſt important Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
                  <p>The Method I would propoſe is, that they be given to the Seamen, under proper Direction, from the time of their ſailing upon long Voyages: And I moſt heartily wiſh ſome Experiments, of this kind, may be made of them; as I am perſuaded that they may be tried without the leaſt Hazard; and the Expence too trifling to be mentioned as an Objection.</p>
                  <p>For if they prove Succeſsful, and anſwer the End hereby propoſed, and hoped for; it will be Happy for the Publick; for the valuable Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals; and for Me, who have preſumed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Experiment.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0648900800:21"/>to about fifteen Ounces, after the Fulmination. To theſe add of White Hellebore, and Liquorice Powder, each ſix Ounces; of Opium five Ounces. Powder all theſe together; and ſift them through a fine Lawn Sieve.</p>
               <p>Doſe, from Twenty-five to Fifty Grains,</p>
               <p>For, <hi>it is to be obſerved,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> adviſed ſuch of his Patients, as had never taken any of his Sweats, to begin with half a Paper only, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the full Doſe) and to increaſe the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or not, according to its Operation, or the Age and Strength of the Patient.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Sweating Powders, from what I have ſeen and felt, are, in my Opinion, the moſt Excellent of all Sweats, for removing <hi>Rheumatic,</hi> and other Pains, occaſioned by Obſtructions.</p>
               <p>They generally raiſe plentiful Sweats; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient drinking moderately, now and then, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Warm. They do not fatigue the Body, nor exhauſt the Spirits. Inſtead of being reſtleſs, as is commonly the Caſe in a Sweat, all thoſe who can bear Opiates, find themſelves comfortably at Eaſe, during the Sweat. Thoſe, with whom Opiates do not perfectly agree, need not be afraid of the firſt of theſe Sweats: For though I cannot bear even Venice Treacle, or Diacodium, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Narcotic Quality; yet I have taken theſe Powders, without finding that Inconvenience. This, I am told, is to be attributed to the Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ingredients, and the Manner of preparing and compounding them. Whether thoſe, who have informed me, Reaſon juſtly or not, is not my Province to determine: But the Fact, in regard to myſelf, is ſtrictly True.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen One of theſe Sweats reſtore a Limb rendered almoſt Uſeleſs, by a Paralytic Diſorder: And, in <hi>Rheumatic Caſes,</hi> Cures performed, where
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0648900800:22"/>the Uſe of all the Limbs had been quite taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> always adviſed thoſe who took <hi>Theſe,</hi> and all Sweats, to put themſelves rather between <hi>Blankets</hi> than Sheets; which I have experienced to be the moſt agreeable Way, notwithſtanding a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Prejudice againſt trying the Experiment.</p>
               <p>The former of theſe Receipts is taken from Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Book; and I do believe it to be his firſt Manner of making them, and what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to give for ſome Years: For I remember his telling me (when I related to him the Senſations I felt during their Operation) that there was Opium and Ipecacuanha in them.</p>
               <p>Yet I am of Opinion that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> has, in ſome Degree, departed from his <hi>Firſt</hi> Manner; and made them according to the <hi>Latter Receipt:</hi> For I am credibly informed, that they have been ſo made, and ſold, ſince his Death; excepting in the Quantity of Opium; of which there are three Eighths leſs in this Receipt, than was put into the Powders ſo made and ſold. This Alteration is made, upon hearing that thoſe, who took them, complained of the Effects of ſo large a Quantity of Opium. However, I believe that Both are very good, with this Abatement of that Ingredient in the Latter: And, therefore, Care will be taken that Both theſe Sweats be prepared, and ſold: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Tryal may be made, and the Preference given to <hi>That</hi> which ſhall be found moſt agreeable to each reſpective Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Powders ſeems to be moſt proper for thoſe who have not been uſed to take <hi>Opiates,</hi> or have found them to diſagree; (as they, in general, do with me) and the <hi>Latter</hi> for ſuch, with whom they are known to agree: For there ſtill remains (notwithſtanding the beforementioned Abatement) a larger Quantity of Opium in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0648900800:23"/>
                  <hi>Latter,</hi> than in the <hi>Former</hi> of theſe two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</p>
               <p>By Way of Experiment, I prevailed on a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to take one of the <hi>Latter</hi> Sweats, charged with the full Quantity of Opium; (that is, three Eighths more than in the above Receipt) and he told me that it affected his Head very much.</p>
               <p>At a proper Interval he took one of thoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt Receipt; and aſſured me that <hi>Both</hi> ſweated him very well; but the <hi>Former</hi> much more agreeably than the <hi>Latter.</hi>

               <head>Paſte for the <hi>FISTULA, &amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TAKE a Pound of Alicampane Root; Three Pounds of Fennil Seeds, and One Pound of Black Pepper. Pound theſe ſeparately, and ſift them through a fine Sieve. Take two Pounds of good Honey, and two Pounds of Powder Sugar; melt the Honey and the Sugar together, over a gentle Fire, ſcumming them continually, till they become bright as Amber. When they are Cool, mix and knead them into your Powder, in the Form of a ſoft Paſte.</p>
               <p>This Paſte has been found to be a Specifie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the Fiſtula, Piles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doſe is the Size of a Nutmeg, Morning, Noon, and Night, drinking a Glaſs of Water or White Wine after it.</p>
               <p>Atteſted by me, <hi>F. J. D'OSTERMAN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to this Fiſtula Paſte, it is not above Twelve Years ſince Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> firſt made uſe of it; and it has happened, that but one of my Acquaintance has been afflicted with this Wretched Complaint. He was under Sentence for Cutting; and was to have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0648900800:24"/>been Cut, had not a ſudden, and ſevere Froſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Operation. In the mean Time, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (hearing that I had ſpoken of Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Medicine, which cured many of this Diſtemper, when the Operation had failed) ſent to me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether what he had heard was true; and whether I thought he had a Chance of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> without undergoing ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Operation, at a Time when he had an Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Fever; and was, upon the whole, very ill.</p>
               <p>Having a Confidence in what I had heard of the Cures made by Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> with this Paſte; I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the Gentleman's Servant to <hi>London,</hi> with a Letter to Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and the Gentleman's Caſe in Writing, drawn up by his Surgeon. Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> ſent down a Ball, weighing one Pound, of this Paſte; directing him to take the Size of a Nutmeg two or three times a Day. He did ſo; and, in leſs than three Weeks his Feveriſh Diſorder left him; his Appetite returned; and, in about three Months he was perfectly cured of his Fiſtula, without any viſible Operation, or taking any other Medicine; to the great Surprize of his Surgeon. However, Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> ordered him to take another Ball, to confirm the Cure; which he did, at proper Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and has had no Return of his Diſorder, that I have heard of, though ſome Years have paſt, and the Gentleman lives within a few Miles of my Houſe in the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> The Receipt for making this Paſte ſtands entered in Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Book, in ſome reſpects dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that I have given from Mr. <hi>D'Oſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> For, in the former, there is double the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Alicampane, to what there is in the latter. The Book likewiſe directs clarified Honey alone; whereas the above Receipt orders Honey and Sugar, equal Quantities, clarified together.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, therefore, that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> entered his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0648900800:25"/>Receipt ſome Time ago, and miſtook the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Alicampane: For I am aſſured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that Mr. <hi>D'Oſterman</hi> always prepared this Paſte for Him, in the Manner he ſold it; that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> never ſold any but of Mr. <hi>D'Oſterman</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring; and Mr. <hi>D'Oſterman</hi> affirms he never put a greater Quantity of Alicampane into this Paſte, than is mentioned in this Receipt, ſigned by him; and that the Addition of the Sugar was made, in order to preſerve the Paſte from turning Mouldy; as it is, otherwiſe, apt to do.</p>
               <p>I think it proper, in this Place, to acquaint the Public, that Mr. <hi>D'Oſterman</hi> is another ingenious Chymiſt, who has been, for ſeveral Years paſt, conſulted and employed by the late Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> in wholly preparing ſeveral of the Medicines which he diſpenſed; and particularly thoſe which I thought it neceſſary for Mr. <hi>D'Oſterman</hi> to atteſt, as they differ, in ſome Particulars, from the Entries made in Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Book.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Liquid</hi> Sweat I have had no Experience of myſelf; nor do I happen to be acquainted with any Body, who has taken it: But I am well aſſured Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> uſed to ſell a great many of them, in a Year; finding them anſwer, with ſome Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in certain Caſes, better than the Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Powders</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>I have not yet found <hi>this</hi> Sweat, preciſely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Book: But as He is known to have ſold many, as I have already ſaid; and as I am thoroughly ſatisfied that Mr. <hi>D'Oſterman</hi> always prepared them for him, in the Manner above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; I have thought it right to give this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt to the Public, as One worthy of Notice.</p>

               <p>The firſt of theſe Receipts is taken from Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Book; and, I ſuppoſe it to be a very good one: Yet, I give the Preference to the laſt, ſigned by Mr. <hi>D'Oſterman;</hi> who aſſures me that the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, long uſed by Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> to remove Pains in the Head, Side, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by outward Application, was prepared and delivered by him, from time to time, to Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> at a certain Price.</p>
               <p>I am of Opinion that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> never ſold any of this Eſſence; nor would He ever give any of it even to me: But He once cured me of the Head-Ach with it; and afterwards told me that He had entirely removed a Pain long ſettled in the upper Joint of His late Majeſty's Thumb; when many other Remedies had been tried, without Effect: And <hi>that,</hi> in the ſame manner as he cured my Head-Ach.</p>

               <p>The Difference, in Price, between what the above Medicines were ſold for, and that at which they will now be ſold, is undoubtedly great; and yet, there ſtill remains a conſiderable Difference between the Expenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of making them, and the Prices now put upon them: But when it is conſidered that a Profit muſt be made, to pay thoſe who are to have the Trouble of ſelling them; and a Perſon, who muſt be employed to carry them from the Makers to the Venders, and keep an Account with each: What a vaſt Number muſt be ſold, at <hi>ſuch low Rates,</hi> to raiſe a Sum ſufficient to anſwer <hi>theſe,</hi> and, perhaps, other neceſſary Contingent Charges: And that the <hi>Surplus,</hi> after diſcharging theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0648900800:30"/>will, under certain Limitations, be equally divided between two Charitable Foundations: When all this is, I ſay, conſidered; no Diſſatisfaction can, I think, ariſe upon account of <hi>Price.</hi> Neither can I ſuppoſe, that any Prudent or Well-diſpoſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can, or will be inclined to <hi>buy</hi> theſe Medicines of any <hi>New Makers</hi> of them, though offered at a lower Price, when he conſiders that <hi>Thoſe,</hi> who have been <hi>long practiced</hi> in preparing Medicines of this kind, are moſt likely to do it in the <hi>beſt Manner:</hi> And that the <hi>Net Profits,</hi> accruing from the Sale of thoſe made by the two ingenious Chymiſts before-mentioned, will go towards the Support of two Laudable Undertakings; the One, intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve young deſtitute Girls from Proſtitution and Wretchedneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The</hi> Aſylum.</note>: The Other, to retrieve them from Both<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The</hi> Magdalen.</note>.</p>
               <p>I have now explained which of the late Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Medicines I propoſe to lay open to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, at this time; and, why I ſtop here. The very low Price, at which it is intended they ſhall be ſold, has been mentioned: But let not this Circumſtance, which ſhews how little they coſt in making, and renders them attainable to the <hi>Lower Claſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> cauſe them to be deſpiſed by the <hi>Higheſt;</hi> who ought always to remember, that they are of the ſame Species with the Loweſt; and that <hi>Price</hi> does not alter the Nature of Things; though I have ſeen it influence Taſte; which, like other of our Senſes, is too often governed by Imagination.</p>
               <p>Nor let this Circumſtance of <hi>Cheapneſs</hi> detract, in the leaſt from the Character of my late Friend; nor add too much to mine: For it ſhould be made known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not forgot, that He obtained ſome of his Medicines by Experiments; ſome from his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants in the Chymical Way, whom he paid; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0648900800:31"/>others, perhaps, he bought at High Prices: That, when he returned from <hi>Paris,</hi> His ſole Dependence was upon the Sale of his Medicines; and that He was at conſiderable Expences, to keep himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Reſpectable Footing. Wherefore, if for theſe Purpoſes, and the better to enable him to gratify his Inclination in giving to the <hi>Poor,</hi> he made the <hi>Rich</hi> pay, who will blame Him?</p>
               <p>But, to me He <hi>gave</hi> theſe valuable Secrets: And I (who am not, Thanks be to God, in the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which Mr. Ward was, at the time I have been ſpeaking of,) give them to the Public.</p>
