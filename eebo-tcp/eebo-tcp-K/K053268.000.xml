            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IN diſpoſing the order of the following work, we have not thought it neceſſary to confine ourſelves ſtrictly within the rules preſcribed by ſyſtematic writers on this part of Natural Hiſtory; as it was not ſo much the object of our plan, to lay down a methodical arrangement of the various tribes of four-footed animals, as to give a clear and conciſe account of the nature, habits, and diſpoſition of each, accompanied with more accurate repreſentations than have hitherto appeared in any work of this kind. Our diſregard of ſyſtem, however, has not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us from attending to the great diviſions of Quadrupeds, ſo obviouſly marked out by the hand of Nature, and ſo clearly diſtinguiſhed, that the moſt careleſs obſerver cannot avoid being forcibly ſtruck with an agreement of parts in the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the different individuals of which each conſiſts.</p>
            <p>The intermediate ſtations, however, have not been always ſo clearly defined; theſe are frequently occupied by characters ſo dubious, that naturaliſts have not always agreed in aſcribing to each its proper place: Of this kind are the Elephant, the Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popotamus, the Rhinoceros, the Cameleopard, the Badger, the Beaver, the Hedge-hog, the Sloth, the Jerboa, &amp;c. which bear in themſelves characteriſtics ſo peculiar, that they might ſeem to conſtitute diſtinct genera, and ſo conſpicuous, that they cannot eaſily be overlooked nor forgotten in the general group.</p>
            <p>We have endeavoured to lay before our readers a particular account of the animals with which our own country is abundantly ſtored, eſpecially of thoſe which ſo materially contribute to the ſtrength, the wealth, and the happineſs of this kingdom; of theſe the Horſe, the Cow, and the Sheep claim the firſt place; and in treating of theſe, we have noticed the improvements which an enlarged ſyſtem of agriculture, ſupported by a noble ſpirit of generous emulation, has introduced into all parts of the country.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be thought neceſſary to offer ſome apology for the evident want of proportion obſervable in the ſizes of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent animals; a defect to which every work of this kind muſt, in ſome meaſure, be liable. In adverting to this, we found, that at whatever point, between the Elep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the Mouſe, the ſcale were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, a great and unavoidable deficiency would be the conſequence; we were therefore obliged to relinquiſh a plan, which, ſo far from being practicable, would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <head>THE HORSE.</head>
               <p>THE various excellencies of this noble animal, the grandeur of his ſtature, the elegance and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his parts, the beautiful ſmoothneſs of his ſkin, the variety and gracefulneſs of his motions, and above all, his uſefulneſs, entitle him to a precedence in the hiſtory of the brute creation.</p>
               <p>There are few parts of the known world where the Horſe is not produced; but if we would ſee him in the enjoyment of his native freedom, (unſubdued by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints man has impoſed upon him) we muſt look for him in the wild and extenſive plains of Africa and Arabia, where he ranges without controul, in a ſtate of entire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency. In thoſe immenſe tracts the wild Horſes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0209200900:9"/>
may be ſeen feeding together, in droves of four or five hundred; one of them always acting as centinel, to give notice of approaching danger: This he does by a kind of ſnorting noiſe, upon which they all fly off with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rapidity. The wild Horſes of Arabia are eſteemed the moſt beautiful in the world: They are of a brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, their mane and tail of black tufted hair, very ſhort; they are ſmaller than the tame ones, are very active, and of great ſwiftneſs. The moſt uſual method of taking them is with traps concealed in the ſand, by which they are entangled and caught.—It is probable there were once wild Horſes in Europe, which have long ſince been brought under ſubjection. Thoſe found in America were originally of the Spaniſh breed, ſent thither upon its firſt diſcovery, which have ſince become wild, and ſpread themſelves over various parts of that vaſt continent. They are generally ſmall, not exceeding fourteen hands high; with thick heads and clumſy joints: Their ears and necks are longer than thoſe of the Engliſh Horſes. They are eaſily tamed; and if by accident they are ſet at liberty, they ſeldom become wild again; but know their maſter, and may be eaſily caught by him.</p>
               <p>The Horſe, in his domeſtic ſtate, is generous, docile, ſpirited, and yet obedient; adapted to the various pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of pleaſure and convenience, he is equally ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the draught, the field, or the race.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarcely an Arabian, how poor ſoever in other reſpects, but is poſſeſſed of his Horſe, which he conſiders as an invaluable treaſure. Having no other houſe but a tent to dwell in, the Arabian and his Horſe live upon the moſt equal terms: His wife and family, his mare and her foal, are often ſeen lying indiſcriminately together; whilſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0209200900:10"/>
the little children frequently climb without fear upon the body of the inoffenſive animal, which permits them to play with and careſs it without injury. The Arabs never beat their Horſes; they ſpeak to, and ſeem to hold friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercourſe with them; they never whip them, and ſeldom, but in caſes of neceſſity, make uſe of the ſpur. Their agility in leaping is very great; and if the rider happen to fall, they are ſo traceable as to ſtand ſtill in the midſt of the moſt rapid career. The Arabian Horſes are of a middle ſize in general, leſs than thoſe of this country, eaſy and graceful in their motions, and rather inclined to leanneſs.—It is worthy of remark, that there, inſtead of croſſing the breed, the Arabs take every precaution to keep it pure and unmixed: They preſerve with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care, and for an amazing length of time, the races of their horſes—Thoſe of the firſt kind are called Nobles, being "of a pure and ancient race, purer than milk." They have likewiſe two other kinds, which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by common alliances, and ſell at inferior prices.</p>
               <p>From Arabia the race of Horſes has probably extended into Barbary and other parts of Africa, thoſe being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as next to the Arabian Horſes in ſwiftneſs and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though they are ſtill ſmaller. The Spaniſh Genette is alſo held in great eſtimation; like the former they are ſmall, but beautiful, and extremely ſwift. The Horſes of India and many parts of China are extremely ſmall and vicious: One of theſe was ſome years ago brought into this country as a preſent to the queen, which was very little larger than ſome maſtiffs, meaſuring only nine hands in height.</p>
               <p>In Great-Britain the breed of Horſes ſeems to be as mixed as that of its inhabitants. By great attention to the

The cavalry of England is in general formed of this claſs of Horſes; but their inutility being experienced in ſome ſituations, others of a lighter and more active kind have been ſubſtituted in a few regiments. The fens of Lincolnſhire generally produce a larger breed than any other part of the kingdom. In London there have been inſtances where a ſingle Horſe of that kind has drawn, for a ſmall ſpace, the enormous weight of three tons, half of which is known to be their ordinary draught.</p>

               <p>Although the Horſe is endowed with vaſt ſtrength and powers, he ſeldom exerts either to the prejudice of his maſter: On the contrary, he ſeems to participate in his pleaſure, and ſhares with him in his labours; generous and perſevering, he gives up his whole powers to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his maſter; though bold and intrepid, he repreſſes the natural vivacity and fire of his temper, and not only yields to the hand, but ſeems to conſult the inclination of his rider.</p>

                  <figure/> THE MULE.</head>
               <p>THIS uſeful and hardy animal is the offspring of the Horſe and the Aſs, and being barren, furniſhes us with an indiſputable proof that the two ſpecies are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſtinct. Nature has providently ſtopped the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther propagation of theſe heterogeneous productions, to preſerve, uncontaminated, the form of each animal; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which regulation the races would, in a ſhort time, be mixed with each other, and every creature loſing its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal perfection, would rapidly degenerate.</p>
               <p>The common Mule is very healthy, and will live above thirty years: It is found very ſerviceable in carrying bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, particularly in mountainous and ſtony places where Horſes are not ſo ſure-footed. The ſize and ſtrength of our breed has lately been much improved by the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spaniſh Male-Aſſes; and it were much to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the uſeful qualities of this animal were more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to: For by proper care in its breaking, its natural obſtinacy would be in a great meaſure corrected; and it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0209200900:18"/>
might be formed with ſucceſs, for the ſaddle, the draught, or the burthen.</p>
               <p>People of the firſt quality in Spain are drawn by Mules, where fifty or ſixty guineas is no uncommon price for one of them; nor is it ſurprizing, when we conſider how far they excel the Horſe in travelling in a mountainous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Mule being able to tread ſecurely where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can hardly ſtand. Their manner of going down the precipices of the Alps, the Andes, &amp;c. is very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; and with it we will conclude their hiſtory. In theſe paſſages, on one ſide, are ſteep eminences, and on the other, frightful abyſſes; and, as they generally follow the direction of the mountain, the road, inſtead of lying in a level, forms at every little diſtance ſteep declivities, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred yards downward. Theſe can only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by Mules; and the animal itſelf ſeems ſenſible of the danger, and the caution that is to be uſed in ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents. When they come to the edge of one of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents, they ſtop without being checked by the rider; and if he inadvertently attempt to ſpur them on, they continue immoveable. They ſeem all this time ruminating on the danger that lies before them, and preparing themſelves for the encounter. They not only attentively view the road, but tremble and ſnort at the danger. Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the deſcent, they place their fore feet in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as if they were ſtopping themſelves; they then alſo put their hinder feet together, but a little forward, as if they were going to lie down. In this attitude, having taken as it were a ſurvey of the road, they ſlide down with the ſwiftneſs of a meteor. In the mean time, all the rider has to do is to keep himſelf faſt on the ſaddle without checking the rein, for the leaſt motion is ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0209200900:19"/>
the equilibrium of the Mule; in which caſe they both unavoidably periſh. But their addreſs in this rapid deſcent is truly wonderful; for in their ſwifteſt motion, when they ſeem to have loſt all government of themſelves, they follow exactly the different windings of the road, as if they had previouſly ſettled in their minds the route they were to follow, and taken every precaution for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In this journey the natives place themſelves along the ſides of the mountains, and holding by the roots of the trees, animate the beaſts with ſhouts, and encourage them to perſevere. Some Mules, after being long uſed to theſe journies, acquire a kind of reputation for their ſafety and ſkill; and their value riſes in proportion to their fame.</p>

                  <figure/> THE ASS.</head>
               <p>THE Aſs, it is probable, was originally a native of Arabia and other parts of the eaſt: The deſerts of Lybia and Numidia, and many iſlands of the Archipelago, contain vaſt herds of wild Aſſes, which run with ſuch amazing ſwiftneſs, that even the courſers of the country can hardly overtake them. They are chiefly caught by the natives on account of their fleſh, which is eaten by them, and conſidered as a delicious repaſt. The fleſh of the common or tame Aſs is however drier, more tough, and diſagreeable than that of the Horſe; Galen ſays it is even unwholeſome: Its milk, on the contrary, is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved remedy for certain diſorders. The wild Aſs is not ſtreaked like the Zebra, (with which it has often been confounded) nor is his form ſo beautiful: His figure reſembles that of the common Aſs, his colour is brighter, and he has a white ſtreak extending from his head to his tail.</p>
               <p>The Aſs, like the Horſe, was originally imported into
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0209200900:21"/>
America by the Spaniards, where it has run wild, and multiplied in a great degree. Ulloa informs us, that, in the kingdom of Quito, they hunt them in the following manner:—A number of perſons on horſeback, attended by Indians on foot, form a large circle in order to drive them into a narrow compaſs, where at full ſpeed they throw a nooſe over them, and having ſecured them with fetters, leave them till the chace is over, which frequently laſts for ſeveral days. They have all the ſwiftneſs of Horſes; and neither declivities nor precipices can retard them in their flight. When attacked, they defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their heels and mouths with ſuch activity, that, without ſlackening their pace, they often maim their purſuers.</p>
               <p>A warm climate is moſt favourable to the growth of this animal: The Aſs produced in this country, is much inferior in ſize and beauty to thoſe of Spain and other warm countries: In Guinea they are larger and more beautiful than even their Horſes: In Perſia they have two kinds, the one ſlow and heavy, which is made uſe of for carrying burthens; the other, nimble, ſmooth, and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, uſed chiefly for the ſaddle. They are managed as Horſes; and, like them, are taught to amble. They ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſlit their noſtrils to give them more room for breathing. Many of theſe are ſold as high as forty or fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Holingſhed informs us, that in the reign of queen Elizabeth there were no Aſſes in this country: How ſoon after they might be introduced is uncertain. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are at preſent naturalized in this kingdom, where their utility becomes daily more univerſally expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0209200900:22"/>The qualities of this animal are ſo well known as to need no deſcription: His gentleneſs, patience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, are without example: He is temperate with regard to food; and eats contentedly the coarſeſt and moſt neglected herbage: If he give the preference to any vegetable, it is to the plantain, for which he will neglect every other herb in the paſture. In his water he is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly nice, drinking only from the cleareſt brooks. He is ſo much afraid of wetting his feet, that, even when load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, he will turn aſide to avoid the dirty parts of the road.</p>
               <p>He is ſtronger, in proportion to his ſize, than the Horſe; but more ſluggiſh, ſtubborn, and untractable. He is healthier than the Horſe; and, of all other quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds, is leaſt infeſted with lice or other vermin, which is probably owing to the extreme hardneſs and dryneſs of his ſkin. For the ſame reaſon, perhaps, he is leſs ſenſitive of the goads of the whip, or the ſtinging of flies.</p>
               <p>He is three or four years in coming to perfection; and lives to the age of twenty, or ſometimes twenty-five years. He ſleeps much leſs than the Horſe; and never lies down for that purpoſe but when he is much fatigued. The She-Aſs goes eleven months with young; and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom produces more than one at a time.</p>
               <p>The ſervices of this uſeful creature are too often repaid by hard fare and cruel uſage; and being generally the property of the poor, it partakes of their wants and their diſtreſſes: Whereas, by due cultivation and care in its education, the Aſs might be uſefully and profitably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a variety of domeſtic purpoſes, and in many caſes ſupply the place of the Horſe, to which only it is ſecond, though generally degraded into the moſt uſeleſs and neglected of domeſtic quadrupeds.</p>

               <p>WHICH many authors have miſtaken for a wild Aſs, is the moſt beautiful, as well as the wildeſt, moſt timid, and untameable animal in nature. Being larger than the Aſs, it rather reſembles the Mule in ſhape: Its head is large; its ears longer than thoſe of the Horſe; its legs beautifully ſmall, and well placed; and its body well formed, round, and fleſhy: But the beauty of its ſhape is greatly heightened by the gloſſy ſmoothneſs of its ſkin, and the amazing regularity and elegance of its colours, which in the male are white and brown, and in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male white and black, ranged in alternate ſtripes over the whole body, in a ſtile ſo beautiful and ornamental, that it would at firſt ſight ſeem rather the effect of art than the genuine production of nature: The head is ſtriped with fine bands of black and white, which form a center in the forehead: The neck is adorned with ſtripes of the ſame colour running round it: The body is beautifully varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0209200900:24"/>
with bands running acroſs the back, and ending in points at the belly: Its thighs, its legs, its ears, and even its tail, are all beautifully ſtreaked in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>The Zebra inhabits the ſouthern parts of Africa, where whole herds are ſeen feeding in thoſe extenſive plains that lie towards the Cape of Good Hope. However their watchfulneſs is ſuch, that they will ſuffer nothing to come near them; and their ſwiftneſs ſo great, that they eaſily leave their purſuers far behind.</p>
               <p>Such is the beauty of this creature, that it ſeems by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fitted to gratify the pride, and formed for the ſervice of man; and it is moſt probable that time and aſſiduity alone are wanting to bring it under ſubjection. As it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the Horſe in regard to its form as well as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, there can be little doubt but it poſſeſſes a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of nature, and only requires the efforts of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and ſkilful nation, to be added to the number of our uſeful dependants. Nevertheleſs its liberty has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto remained uncontrouled, and its natural fierceneſs has as yet reſiſted every attempt to ſubdue it: Thoſe that have been brought to this country, have diſcovered a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of viciouſneſs that rendered it unſafe to approach them too familiarly; but it is by no means to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from hence, that they are untameable.</p>
               <p>They have continued to be wild, becauſe they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a country where the wretched inhabitants have no other idea of advantage from the animal creation than as they are good for food, paying more regard to that which affords the moſt delicious repaſt, than to delicacy of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring, or beauty of conformation.</p>

                  <figure/> THE COMMON BULL AND COW.</head>
               <p>OF all animals, except man, the Cow ſeems moſt extenſively propagated: It is equally capable of enduring the rigours of heat and cold; and is an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the frozen as well as the moſt ſcorching climates. Other animals preſerve their nature or their form with inflexible perſeverance; but theſe in every reſpect ſuit
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0209200900:27"/>
themſelves to the wants and conveniences of mankind. In no animal is there to be met with a greater variety of kinds; and in none a more humble and pliant diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The climate and paſtures of Great-Britain are well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the moderate nature of this animal; and we are indebted to the variety and abundance of our wholeſome vegetables for the number and excellence of our cattle, which range over our hills, and enliven our plains; a ſource of inexhauſtible wealth—the pride and boaſt of this happy country.</p>
               <p>Being deſtitute of the upper fore-teeth, the Cow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the high and rich graſs in paſtures to the ſhort and more delicate herbage the Horſe generally ſelects. For this reaſon, in our Engliſh paſtures, where the graſs is rather high and flouriſhing than ſucculent and nutritious, the Cow thrives admirably; and there is no part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope in which this animal grows larger<note n="*" place="bottom">Two Oxen, bred and fed at Howick, in the county of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland, were killed in March, 1787, at the age of ſeven years: They meaſured from the head to the rump nine feet eight inches, the height at the ſhoulder was five feet ten inches, and weighed one hundred and ſeventy-eight ſtone five pounds each.</note>, yields more milk, nor fattens ſooner.</p>
               <p>It has often been remarked, that the Horſe and Sheep impoveriſh the ſoil on which they graze; whilſt the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where the Cow is fed, acquires a finer ſurface, and every year becomes more level and beautiful: For the Horſe ſelects the graſs that is moſt delicate and tender, and being furniſhed with fore-teeth on each jaw, nips it cloſe, and frequently pulls it up by the roots, thereby preventing its future growth and propagation: The Sheep alſo, though formed like the Cow with reſpect to its teeth, only bites the moſt ſucculent parts of the herbage.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0209200900:28"/>
Theſe animals therefore cut the fine graſs too cloſely, and ſuffer the high weeds and ranker graſs to vegetate undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, and overrun the paſtures.</p>
               <p>The age of the Cow is known by its horns: At the age of four years a ring is formed at their roots, and every ſucceeding year another ring is added. Thus by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three years before their appearance, and then reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of rings, the creature's age may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly known.</p>
               <p>The quantity of milk given by the Cow is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: Some will yield only about ſix quarts in one day, while others give from ten to fifteen, and ſometimes even twenty. The richneſs of the paſture contributes not a little to its encreaſe. There have been inſtances of Cows giving upwards of thirty quarts of milk in one day. In ſuch caſes there is a neceſſity for milking them thrice. From the milk of ſome cows twelve or fourteen pounds of butter are made in a week.</p>
               <p>It has been advanced by ſome naturaliſts as a general principle, that neither animals, nor parts of animals, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be primarily intended for the uſe of man; but are only capable of a ſecondary application to his purpoſes: Yet it muſt be allowed, that, in many inſtances, what they term the ſecondary uſe is ſo manifeſt and important, that it cannot, with propriety, be ſuppoſed to be excluded from the original deſigns of the all-wiſe Creator: And it muſt be allowed, that the Cow, in its faculty of giving in ſuch abundance, and with ſo much eaſe, its milk, which forms ſo rich and nutritive an aliment for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies, is a ſtriking example of this ſubordination to the intereſts of mankind: For this animal differs, in ſome parts of its organization from moſt others, having
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0209200900:29"/>
a larger and more capacious udder, and longer and thicker teats, than the largeſt animal we know. It has likewiſe four teats, while all other animals of the ſame nature have but two. It alſo yields the milk freely to the hand, while moſt animals, at leaſt thoſe that do not ruminate in the ſame manner, refuſe it, except their own young, or ſome adopted animal, be allowed to partake.</p>
               <p>The Cow, having four teats, is a ſtriking peculiarity: The number in all other animals bearing ſome proportion to the number of young ones they bring forth at a time; as in the Bitch, the Cat, the Sow, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Cow will yield her milk as freely, and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to give it as long, without the aid of the calf, as if it were permitted to ſuck her conſtantly. This is not the caſe with the Aſs; which, it is well known, will ſoon grow dry, if her foal be not permitted to ſuck part of her milk every day.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it appears, that the property of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing milk, without the young one, is confined to thoſe kinds of ruminating horned animals which have cloven hoofs, four ſtomachs, long inteſtines, are furniſhed with ſuet, and have no fore-teeth in the upper jaw; that Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Deer, are of this kind, and no other; and that the Cow has this property in a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree than others, owing to the capaciouſneſs of her udder, and the ſize and form of her teats.</p>
               <p>By great induſtry and attention to their breed, and by judicious mixtures with thoſe of other countries, our horned cattle are univerſally allowed to be the fineſt in Europe; although ſuch as are purely Britiſh are inferior in ſize to thoſe on many parts of the continent. The large ſpecies now propagated in moſt parts of England,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0209200900:30"/>
are either entirely foreign, or our own greatly improved by a croſs or mixture with the foreign kind. The Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein or Dutch breed has been introduced with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and from theſe the Lincolnſhire kind derive their ſize.</p>

                  <figure/> THE LANCASHIRE BULL.</head>
               <p>The Lancaſhire breed forms a variety of a ſmaller ſize, with wide ſpreading horns, and ſtraight backs; their hair is finely curled; and the elegance and regularity of their ſhape render this the moſt beautiful race of cattle this kingdom produces. Farther North they are ſtill ſmaller; and in the Highlands of Scotland they are very diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, being not larger than an Aſs. Of theſe large droves are yearly brought out of that country to fatten in the ſouthern parts of the kingdom, where they ſoon greatly improve.</p>
               <p>The Cow ſeems more liable to changes from its paſture and climate than any other quadruped: In the different parts of this narrow iſland we can trace a wonderful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0209200900:31"/>
of theſe animals produced by the richneſs or poverty of the ſoil. In ſhort, in every part of the world the Cow is found either large or ſmall, in proportion to the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or poverty of its food. Among the Eluth Tartars, where the paſtures are remarkably rich and nouriſhing, the Cow grows to ſuch an amazing ſize that a tall man can ſcarcely reach the tip of its ſhoulder. In France, on the contrary, where this animal is ſtinted in its food, and driven from the bed paſtures, it greatly degenerates.</p>
               <p>In Great-Britain, the Ox is the only horned animal that will apply his ſtrength to the ſervice of mankind; and in general, is more profitable than the Horſe for the plough or the draught. There is ſcarcely any part of this animal without its uſe: The ſkin is made into various kinds of leather; the hair is mixed with lime for plaiſtering; the bones are made uſe of as a ſubſtitute for ivory, and being calcined, are uſed by the refiner as an abſorbent to carry off the baſer metals in refining ſilver, &amp;c.; combs, and many ether articles, are made of the horns; we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with candles from the tallow; and from the feet is procured an oil of great uſe in preparing and ſoftening leather; beſides the well-known benefits derived from butter, milk, and cheeſe; its blood, gall, liver, and urine, have their reſpective uſes in manufactures and medicine.</p>
               <p>The Cow goes nine months with young, and ſeldom produces more than one at a time.</p>

               <p>There was formerly a very ſingular ſpecies of wild cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in this country, which is now nearly extinct. Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous herds of them were kept in ſeveral parks in England and Scotland, but have been deſtroyed by various means;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0209200900:33"/>
and the only breed now remaining in the kingdom, is in the park at Chillingham-caſtle, in Northumberland.</p>
               <p>The principal external appearances which diſtinguiſh this breed of cattle from all others, are the following:— Their colour is invariably white; muzzles black; the whole of the inſide of the ear, and about one-third of the outſide, from the tip downwards, red<note n="*" place="bottom">About twenty years ſince, there were a few with BLACK FAR<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, with black tips, very fine, and bent upwards: Some of the Bulls have a thin upright mane, about an inch and an half or two inches long.</p>
               <p>At the firſt appearance of any perſon, they ſet off in full gallop; and, at the diſtance of two or three hundred yards, make a wheel round, and come boldly up again, toſſing their heads in a menacing manner; on a ſudden they make a full ſtop at the diſtance of forty or fifty yards, looking wildly at the object of their ſurprize; but upon the leaſt motion being made, they all again turn round, and fly off with equal ſpeed, but not to the ſame diſtance; forming a ſhorter circle, and again returning with a bolder and more threatening aſpect than before, they approach much nearer, probably within thirty yards; when they make another ſtand, and again fly off: This they do ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al times, ſhortening their diſtance and advancing nearer, till they come within ten yards, when moſt people think it prudent to leave them, not chuſing to provoke them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for there is little doubt but in two or three turns they would make an attack.</p>
               <p>The made of killing them was perhaps the only modern remains of the grandeur of ancient hunting:—On notice
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0209200900:34"/>
being given, that a wild Bull would be killed on a certain day, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood came mounted, and armed with guns, &amp;c. ſometimes to the amount of an hundred horſe, and four or five hundred foot, who ſtood upon walls, or got into trees, while the horſemen rode off the Bull from the reſt of the herd, until he ſtood at bay; when a markſman diſmounted and ſhot. At ſome of theſe huntings twenty or thirty ſhots have been fired before he was ſubdued. On ſuch occaſions the bleeding victim grew deſperately furious, from the ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wounds, and the ſhouts of ſavage joy that were echoing from every ſide: But from the number of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that happened, this dangerous mode has been little practiſed of late years, the park-keeper alone generally ſhooting them with a rifled gun, at one ſhot.</p>
               <p>When the Cows calve, they hide their calves for a week or ten days in ſome ſequeſtered ſituation, and go and ſuckle them two or three times a-day. If any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon come near the calves, they clap their heads cloſe to the ground, and lie like a hare in form, to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This is a proof of their native wildneſs; and is corroborated by the following circumſtance that happened to the writer of this narrative, who found a hidden calf, two days old, very lean, and very weak:—On ſtroking its head, it got up, pawed two or three times like an old Bull, bellowed very loud, ſtepped back a few ſteps, and bolted at his legs with all its force; it then began to paw again, bellowed, ſtepped back, and bolted as before; but knowing its intention, and ſtepping aſide, it miſſed him, fell, and was ſo very weak that it could not riſe, though it made ſeveral efforts: But it had done enough: The whole herd were alarmed, and coming to its reſcue,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0209200900:35"/>
obliged him to retire; for the dams will allow no perſon to touch their calves, without attacking them with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ferocity.</p>
               <p>When any one happens to be wounded, or is grown weak and feeble through age or ſickneſs, the reſt of the herd ſet upon it, and gore it to death.</p>
               <p>The weight of the Oxen is generally from forty to fifty ſtone the four quarters; the Cows about thirty. The beef is finely marbled, and of excellent flavour.</p>
               <p>Thoſe at Burton-Conſtable, in the county of York, were all deſtroyed by a diſtemper a few years ſince. They varied ſlightly from thoſe at Chillingham, having black ears and muzzles, and the tips of their tails of the ſame colour; they were alſo much larger, many of them weighing ſixty ſtone, probably owing to the richneſs of the paſturage in Holderneſs, but generally attributed to the difference of kind between thoſe with black and with red ears, the former of which they ſtudiouſly endeavoured to preſerve.—The breed which was at Drumlanrig, in Scotland, had alſo black ears.</p>

               <p>differs from the reſt of the Ox kind in having a large lump between its ſhoulders almoſt as high as that of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel: He has a long ſhaggy mane, which forms a kind of beard under his chin; his eyes are fierce, his forehead large, and his horns extremely wide. It is dangerous to purſue him, except in foreſts abounding with trees large enough to conceal the hunters. He is generally taken in pits covered with branches of trees and graſs, on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide of which the hunters tempt the animal to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them; and the enraged creature running towards them, falls into the trap prepared for it, and is then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered and ſlain.</p>
               <p>The Biſon, or the animal with the hump, is found in all the ſouthern parts of the world, though greatly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from each other in ſize and form; while the Urus, or the one without the hump, chiefly occupies the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and cold climates. The former extend throughout the vaſt continent of India, and from Mount Atlas to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0209200900:38"/>
the Cape of Good Hope. In ſome parts they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely large; while in others they are very ſmall, ſuch as the Zebu or Barbary Cow.</p>

               <p>They are all equally docile and gentle, when tamed; and are in general covered with fine gloſſy hair, ſofter and more beautiful than that of the common Cow. Their humps are of different ſizes, in ſome weighing from forty to fifty pounds, but in others leſs: That part is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſidered as a great delicacy; and when dreſſed, has much the appearance and taſte of udder.</p>
               <p>The Biſons of Madagaſcar and Malabar are of the great kind; thoſe of Arabia, Petrea, and moſt parts of Africa, are of the Zebu or ſmall kind.</p>
               <p>In America, eſpecially towards the North, the Biſon is well known. They herd together in droves of from one to two hundred, on the banks of the Miſſiſippi; where the inhabitants hunt them, their fleſh being eſteemed good eating. They all breed with the tame cow. The
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0209200900:39"/>
hump, which is only an accidental characteriſtic, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally declines; and in a few generations, no veſtiges of it remain. Thus we ſee, whether it be the wild or the tame Ox, the Bonaſus or the Urus, the Biſon or the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu, by whatever name they are diſtinguiſhed, and though variouſly claſſed by naturaliſts, in reality they are the ſame; and however diverſified in their appearance and properties, are deſcendants of one common ſtock; of which the moſt unequivocal proof is, that they all mix and breed with each other.</p>
               <p>The Oxen of India are of different ſizes, and are made uſe of in travelling, as ſubſtitutes for horſes. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pace is ſoft. Inſtead of a bit, a ſmall cord is paſſed through the cartilage of the noſtrils, which is tied to a larger cord, and ſerves as a bridle. They are ſaddled like Horſes; and when puſhed, move very briſkly: They are likewiſe uſed in drawing chariots and carts. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purpoſe, white Oxen are in great eſteem, and much admired: They will perform journies of ſixty days, at the rate of from twelve to fifteen leagues a day; and their travelling pace is generally a trot.</p>
               <p>In Perſia there are many Oxen entirely white, with ſmall blunt horns, and humps on their backs. They are very ſtrong, and carry heavy burthens. When about to be loaded, they drop down on their knees like the camel, and riſe when their burthens are properly faſtened.</p>

               <p>The Sarluc, or Grunting Cow of Siberia, from its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the Biſon, may be conſidered as belonging to the ſame ſpecies: The hair on its body is black, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on the front and ridge of the back, where it is white: It has a mane on the neck; and the whole body is covered with very long hair, which hangs down below the knees, and makes the legs appear ſhort: It has a hump on the back; the tail reſembles that of a horſe, is white, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſhy: It ſtrikes with its head like a goat, and is very unruly: Its diſtinguiſhing peculiarity is, that it makes a grunting noiſe like a Hog, inſtead of lowing like the Ox, which in every other inſtance it greatly reſembles.</p>

               <p>Though there is the moſt ſtriking general reſemblance between the Buffalo and our common Ox, both in regard

to form and nature, their habits and propenſities being nearly ſimilar, are both equally ſubmiſſive to the yoke, and may be employed in the ſame domeſtic ſervices; yet it is certain from experience, that no two animals can in reality be more diſtinct;—the Cow refuſes to breed with the Buffalo, while it is known to propagate with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to which it bears, in point of form, a much more diſtant ſimilitude.</p>
               <p>The Buffalo is found wild in many parts of Africa and India, but is moſt common in the countries near the Cape of Good Hope; where he is deſcribed by Sparrman, as a fierce, cruel, and treacherous animal: He frequently ſtands behind trees, waiting the coming of ſome paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; when he ruſhes out upon him, and, after having thrown him down, tramples him to death with his feet and knees, tearing him with his horns and teeth, and licking him with his rough tongue till the ſkin is nearly ſtripped from the body.—The following accurate deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we owe to the ſame author:—The length of the Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falo, from head to tail, is eight feet; the height five and a half; and the fore-legs two feet and a half long: From the tip of the muzzle to the horns, twenty-two inches: His limbs, in proportion to his ſize, are much ſtouter than thoſe of the Ox; his fetlocks likewiſe hang nearer the ground: The horns are ſingular both in their form and poſition; the baſes of them are thirteen inches broad, and only an inch diſtant from each other, having a narrow channel or furrow between them; from this furrow the horns aſſume a ſpherical form, extending over a great part of the head; the ſurface, from the baſe upwards to nearly a third part of them, is very rough, and full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts, ſometimes an inch deep; the diſtance between the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0209200900:42"/>
points is often above five feet: The ears are a foot long, ſomewhat pendent, and in a great meaſure covered and defended by the lower edges of the horns, which bend down on each ſide, forming a curve upwards with the points: Their hair is of a dark-brown colour, about an inch long, harſh, and upon thoſe males that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years, ſtraggling and thin, eſpecially on each ſide of the belly, which gives them the appearance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girt with a belt: They frequently roll themſelves in the mire, of which they are very fond: The tail is ſhort, and tufted at the end: The eyes are large, and ſomewhat ſunk within their prominent orbits, which are almoſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the baſes of the horns overhanging its dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ears; this, with a peculiar inclination of the head to one ſide, which is its uſual manner, produces an aſpect at once fierce, cunning, and tremendous: The fleſh of the Buffalo is coarſe, rather lean, but full of juice of a high, but not unpleaſant flavour: The hide is thick and tough, and of great uſe in making thongs and harneſs; it is ſo hard, as not to be penetrated by a common muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ball; thoſe made uſe of for ſhooting the Buffalo, are mixed with tin; and even they are frequently flattened by the concuſſion.</p>
               <p>In Italy, the Buffalo is domeſticated, and conſtitutes the riches and food of the poor, who employ them for the purpoſes of agriculture, and make butter and cheeſe from their milk.</p>
               <p>The female produces but one at a time, and continues pregnant twelve months;—another ſtriking characteriſtic difference between the Buffalo and the common Cow.</p>

                  <figure/> THE COMMON RAM.</head>
               <p>THE Sheep, in its preſent domeſtic ſtate, ſeems ſo far removed from a ſtate of nature, that it may be deemed a difficult matter to point out its origin. Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, food, and above all, the unwearied arts of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contribute to render this animal, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the creature of man; to whom it is obliged to truſt entirely for its protection, and to whoſe neceſſities it largely contributes. Though ſingularly inoffenſive, and harmleſs even to a proverb, it does not appear to be that ſtupid, inanimate creature deſcribed by Buffon, "devoid of every neceſſary art of ſelf-preſervation, without cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and even deprived of every inſtinctive faculty, we are led to conclude, that the Sheep, of all other animals, is the moſt contemptible and ſtupid:" But amidſt thoſe numerous flocks which range without controul on exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive mountains, where they ſeldom depend upon the aid of the ſhepherd, it will be found to aſſume a very different character: In thoſe ſituations a Ram or a Wedder will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0209200900:44"/>
boldly attack a ſingle Dog, and often come off victorious: But when the danger is more alarming, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the collected ſtrength of the whole flock. On ſuch occaſions they draw up into a compact body, placing the young and the females in the center; while the males take the foremoſt ranks, keeping cloſe by each other. Thus an armed front is preſented on all quarters, and cannot eaſily be attacked without danger of deſtruction to the aſſailant. In this manner they wait with firmneſs the approach of the enemy; nor does their courage fail them in the moment of attack: For when the aggreſſor advances within a few yards of the line, the Rams dart upon him with ſuch impetuoſity as lays him dead at their feet, unleſs he ſave himſelf by flight. Againſt the attacks of ſingle Dogs or Foxes, when in this ſituation, they are perfectly ſecure.—A Ram, regardleſs of danger, will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times engage a Bull; and his forehead being much harder than that of any other animal, he ſeldom fails to conquer: For the Bull, by lowering his head, receives the ſtroke of the Ram between his eyes, which uſually brings him to the ground.</p>
               <p>In the ſelection of their food, few animals diſcover greater ſagacity than the Sheep; nor does any domeſtic animal ſhew more dexterity and cunning in its attempts to elude the vigilance of the ſhepherd, in order to ſteal ſuch delicacies as are agreeable to its palate. Beſides its hardineſs in enduring great ſeverities of weather, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inſtinct of the Sheep in foreſeeing the approach of a ſtorm is no leſs remarkable: In their endeavours to ſecure themſelves under the ſhelter of ſome hill, whole flocks have frequently been buried for many days under a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſnow, and have afterwards been taken out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

any material injury. Thus beautifully deſcribed by Thompſon:—

                     <l>Sweeps up the burthen of whole wintry plains</l>
                     <l>At one wide waſt; and o'er the hapleſs flocks,</l>
                     <l>Hid in the hollow of two neighbouring hills,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There have been inſtances where Sheep, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a ſtorm, have fled for ſhelter to a neighbouring cottage, and taken refuge under the ſame roof with their ſhepherd.</p>
               <p>The variety in this creature is ſo great, that ſcarcely any two countries produce Sheep of the ſame kind; there is found a manifeſt difference in all, either in the ſize, the covering, the ſhape, or the horns.</p>
               <p>The woolly Sheep is found only in Europe and in the temperate provinces of Aſia: When tranſported into warmer climates, it loſes its wool, and becomes hairy and rough; it is likewiſe leſs fertile, and its fleſh no longer retains the ſame flavour.</p>
               <p>No country produces finer Sheep than Great-Britain: Their fleeces are large, and well adapted to the various purpoſes of cloathing. The Spaniſh fleeces are indeed finer, but ſtand in no degree of compariſon with thoſe of Lincolnſhire or Warwickſhire for weight or utility. In Edward the Third's time, when wool was allowed to be exported, it brought 150,000l. per annum, at 2l. 10s. a pack, which was a great ſum in thoſe days: At this time, when our woollen-manufactory ſtands unrivalled by any nation in the world, and every method is taken to prevent this valuable commodity from being ſent out of the kingdom, the annual value of wool ſhorn in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0209200900:46"/>
is eſtimated at two millions ſterling, and when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactured, at no leſs than ſix millions.</p>
               <p>Like other ruminating animals, the Sheep wants the upper fore-teeth: It has eight in the lower jaw, two of which drop out, and are replaced at two years old; four of them art renewed at three years, and the remainder at the age of four.</p>
               <p>The Ewe produces one or two lambs at a time, and ſometimes, though rarely, three or four; bears her young five months, and brings forth in the ſpring. The Ram lives to the age of about fifteen years, and begins to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create at one. When caſtrated, they are called Wedders. They then grow ſooner fat, and the fleſh becomes finer and better flavoured.</p>
               <p>There is hardly any part of this animal that is not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to man: Of the fleece we make our cloths; the ſkin produces leather, of which are made gloves, parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and covers for books; the entrails are formed into ſtrings for fiddles and other muſical inſtruments, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe coverings for whips; its milk affords both butter and cheeſe; and its fleſh is a delicate and wholeſome food.</p>
               <p>The following remarks, taken from Mr Cully's "Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on live ſtock," will not be unacceptable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our readers, as they convey a juſt idea of ſome of the moſt noted kinds of Sheep at this time in the iſland. He begins with thoſe of Lincolnſhire, which are of a large ſize, big-boned, and afford a greater quantity of wool than any other kind, owing to the rich, fat marſhes on which they feed; but their fleſh is coarſe, leaner, and not ſo finely flavoured as that of ſmaller Sheep: The ſame breed extends, with ſome variations, through moſt of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0209200900:47"/>
midland counties of England: But the largeſt breed of Sheep in this iſland, is to be met with on the banks of the Tees, which runs through a rich and fertile country, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the two counties of Yorkſhire and Durham: This kind differs from the preceding, in their wool not being ſo long and heavy; their legs are longer, but finer boned, and ſupport a thicker, firmer carcaſe; their fleſh is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe much fatter, and finer grained: Theſe Sheep weigh from twenty-five to forty-five pounds per quarter; ſome have been fed to fifty pounds; and one in particular was killed, which weighed ſixty-two pounds ten ounces per quarter, avoirdupois—a circumſtance never before heard of in this iſland. The Ewes of this breed generally bring forth two lambs each ſeaſon; ſometimes three, four, and even five. As an inſtance of extraordinary fecundity, it deſerves to be mentioned, that one of theſe Ewes, at the age of two years, brought forth four lambs at one time, the next ſeaſon five, both within eleven months. The Dorſetſhire breed is likewiſe remarkably prolific, the Ewes being capable of bringing forth twice a-year: It is from theſe, that the tables of our nobility and gentry are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with early lamb at Chriſtmas, or ſooner if required. Great numbers of thoſe early victims to luxury are year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to the London markets, where they are ſold at the enormous price of 10s. 6d. or perhaps 15s. per quarter.</p>
               <p>The manner of rearing the lambs is curious: They are impriſoned in little dark cabins; the Ewes are fed with oil-cakes, hay, corn, turnips, cabbages, or any other food which the ſeaſon of the year affords; theſe are given them in a field contiguous to the apartments where the lambs are kept; and at proper intervals, the nurſes are brought in to give ſuck to their young ones; while the <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0209200900:48"/>
attendants, at the ſame time, make their lodgings perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clean, and litter them with freſh draw. Great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is paid to this, as much of the ſucceſs of rearing theſe unſeaſonable productions depends upon warmth and cleanlineſs.</p>
               <p>The Dorſetſhire Sheep are moſtly white-faced; their legs are long and ſmall, and great numbers of them have no wool upon their bellies, which gives them an uncouth appearance. They produce a ſmall quantity of wool, but of a good quality, from which our fine Wiltſhire cloths are made. The mutton of theſe Sheep is very ſweet and well flavoured. The variations of this breed are ſpread through moſt of the ſouthern counties; but the true kind is only to be found in Dorſetſhire and Wiltſhire. There is a breed, not unlike this, in Norfolk and Suffolk; but they are all grey or black-faced.</p>
               <p>The north-weſt part of Yorkſhire, with all that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous tract of country running towards Lancaſhire ſouthward, and to Fort William northward, is occupied by a hardy, black-faced, wild-looking tribe, generally called ſhort Sheep, which differ from our other breeds not only in the darkneſs of their complexions and horns, but principally in the coarſe ſhaggy wool which they produce, not much unlike the hair growing upon a water-ſpaniel. Their eyes have a very ſharp and wild caſt; they run with aſtoniſhing agility, and ſeem quite adapted to the heathy mountains they inhabit. Their fleſh is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly fine and high flavoured. The three great fairs for theſe Sheep (where amazing numbers of them are ſold every year) are, Stagſhawbank, in Northumberland; Brough, in Weſtmorland; and Linton, in Scotland.— There is likewiſe a breed of Sheep inhabiting the ſame
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0209200900:49"/>
country as the former, but peculiarly diſtinguiſhed from them by long, thin bodies, white legs, white faces, and by having no horns. Their wool is fine, and thickly planted.</p>
               <p>The Sheep in the low parts of Northumberland are of a mixed breed, between the long kind, the Tees water, and the Lincolnſhire. The mug or muff kind was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly common in that county: They were ſo called from their wool growing round their heads into their very eyes, ſo as almoſt to prevent them from ſeeing. This breed is now nearly exploded, being conſidered, by every breeder of experience, as unprofitable, from their thriving ſlowly, and being very tender.</p>
               <p>In the northern diſtricts of Scotland, and in many of the iſlands, there is a breed of Sheep which differs from the others in the ſmallneſs of their ſize, many of them when fed weighing no more than ſix, ſeven, or eight pounds per quarter. They have dun faces, without horns; and their wool, which is very fine, is variouſly mixed, and ſtreaked with black, brown, and red.</p>
               <p>To theſe various and numerous tribes of this uſeful animal, we muſt add, that, by the perſevering induſtry and attention of Mr Bakewell, of Diſhley, in Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, our breed of Sheep has been greatly improved; and he has been followed by many eminent breeders, with nearly equal ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be generally agreed, that in Sheep, as well as in all other animals, there is a certain ſymmetry or proportion of parts, which is beſt adapted to the ſize of each particular animal: All thoſe of each kind that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, or fall ſhort of this pitch, are more or leſs diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, according to the ſize they attain to; and in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0209200900:50"/>
the degree they are advanced beyond this line of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, we find them leſs active, weaker, and always leſs able to endure hardſhip. Thus, by ſelecting the handſomeſt and beſt proportioned of their kinds, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious breeder has gradually arrived at a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in improving this animal, unknown at any former period.</p>

               <p>The ſuperior qualities of the Leiceſterſhire breed are, that they will feed quickly fat at almoſt any age, even on indifferent paſtures, and carry the greateſt quantity of mutton upon the ſmalleſt bone. Their carcaſes are round, have remarkably broad backs, and ſhort legs; and to ſhew the immenſe weight to which they may be fed, we give the meaſurement of a Ram of Mr Bake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's, mentioned by Young in his "Eaſtern Tour:"— At three years old his girt was five feet ten inches; height, two feet five inches; breadth over his ſhoulders,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0209200900:51"/>
one foot eleven inches and an half; breadth over his ribs, one foot ten inches and an half; breadth over his hips, one foot nine inches and an half.</p>

                  </gap>ought after, that Mr Bakewell has this year (1788) let out Rams, for one ſeaſon only, for from fifty to as high as four hundred guineas each; and we hope, in a little time, to ſee it become more general, as it is a maxim which every farmer can eaſily comprehend, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever breed the ſame quantity of paſture goes fartheſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards feeding fat, is certainly the moſt deſirable.</p>
               <p>This valuable breed has alſo found its way into North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland. Meſſ. Donkin and Co. of Hexham brewery, have procured a large ſtock of both Ewes and Rams, (from one of the latter the preceding cut was drawn). Meſſ.

               <p>We are favoured by Mr Culley with the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Wedder of his breed, fed at Fenton, in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland, and killed at Alnwick in October, 1787, when four years old:—His dimenſions were as follow,—girt, four feet eight inches and an half; breadth over his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, one foot three inches; over his middle, one foot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inches and a quarter; acroſs the breaſt, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of one fore-leg to the inſide of the other, nine inches.</p>
               <p>At the dividing of the quarters, through the ribs it meaſured ſeven inches and one-eighth of ſolid fat, cut ſtraight through without any ſlope; and his mutton was of the moſt beautiful bright colour: But in nothing was

he ſo remarkable, as in the ſmallneſs of his bones. The proprietor of this Sheep laments, that he had not the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals exactly weighed (by offals, we would be underſtood to mean not only the tallow, but the head, pluck, and pelt, with the blood and entrails); becauſe it is now well known, that this breed of Sheep has a greater quantity of mutton, in proportion to their offals, than any other kind we know of, and is conſequently cheaper to the conſumer.</p>

               <p>another variety of the Sheep kind, deſerves to be noticed for the ſingular and groteſque formation of its features: The wool growing round its head, forms a kind of hood or ruff, before which ſtand its ſhort erect ears; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common protruſion of its under jaw conſiderably before the upper, by which the fore-teeth are left expoſed; and the ſhortneſs of the noſe, which lies under its high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting forehead, altogether give it the appearance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and make a ſtriking contraſt to moſt animals of the Sheep kind.

               <p>The broad-tailed Sheep, common in Perſia, Barbary, Syria, and Egypt, are remarkable chiefly for their large and heavy tails, which grow a foot broad, and ſo long, that the ſhepherds are obliged to put boards with ſmall wheels under them, to keep them from galling.

               <p>In Walachia, they have Sheep with curious ſpiral horns, ſtanding upright, in the form of a ſcrew; long ſhaggy fleeces; and in ſize and form, nearly reſembling ours. They are alſo found in the iſland of Crete, and in many of the iſlands of the Archipelago. This is ſaid to be the Strepſicheros of the ancients.</p>

                  <figure/> THE MOUFLON, OR MUSMON,</head>
               <p>WHICH, by ſome authors, has been claſſed with the Sheep, and by others has been referred to the Goat kind, may not improperly be conſidered as ſtanding in a middle place, and forming the link between each: For it is curious to obſerve, that Nature, in all her variations, proceeds by ſlow and almoſt inſenſible degrees, ſcarcely drawing a firm and diſtinguiſhing line between any two races of animals that are eſſentially different, and yet, in many reſpects, nearly allied to each other. In all tranſitions from one kind to the other, there is to be found a middle race, that ſeems to partake of the nature of both, and that can preciſely be referred to neither. Thus it is hard to diſcover where the Sheep kind ends, or the Goat begins. The Muſmon therefore, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sheep nor Goat, has many marks of both, and forms the link between the two kinds. Though covered with hair, it bears a ſtrong ſimilitude to the Ram: Its eyes are placed near the horns, and its ears are ſhorter than thoſe of the Goat; its horns reſemble thoſe of the Ram,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0209200900:58"/>
in being of a yellow colour and a triangular ſhape; they likewiſe bend backward behind the ears: In ſome they grow to an amazing ſize, meaſuring above two yards long. They often maintain furious battles with each other, in which their horns are frequently broken off. The general colour of the hair is reddiſh-brown; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the thighs and belly is white tinctured with yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; the muzzle and inſide of the ears are of a whitiſh colour tinctured with yellow; the other parts of the ſace are of a browniſh-grey.</p>
               <p>The Muſmon is found in the wild and uncultivated parts of Greece, Sardinia, Corſica, and in the deſarts of Tartary; where it maintains itſelf, by force or ſwiftneſs, againſt the attacks of all rapacious animals.</p>
               <p>It has been known to breed with the Sheep; and, from that circumſtance, is ſuppoſed, by M. Buffon and others, to be the primitive race. The female of this ſpecies is rather leſs than the male; and her horns never grow to that prodigious ſize.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of Kamtſchatka are ſo ſtrong, that ten men can ſcarcely hold one; and the horns are ſo large, that young foxes often ſhelter themſelves in the hollow of ſuch as fall off by accident. They grow to the ſize of a young Stag, propagate in autumn, and bring forth one young at a time, though ſometimes two.</p>

                  <figure/> THE COMMON GOAT.</head>
               <p>THIS lively, playful, and capricious creature occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies the next ſtep in the great ſcale of Nature; and, though inferior to the Sheep in value, in various inſtances bears a ſtrong affinity to that uſeful animal. The Goat and the Sheep will propagate together: The He-Goat copulates with the Ewe, and the Ram with the She-Goat; the offspring likewiſe is prolific.</p>
               <p>The Goat is a much more hardy animal than the Sheep, and is in every reſpect more fitted for a life of liberty: It is not eaſily confined to a flock, but chuſes its own paſture, ſtraying wherever its appetite or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation leads: It chiefly delights in wild and mountainous regions, climbing the loftieſt rocks, and ſtanding ſecure on the verge of inacceſſible and dangerous precipices; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as Ray obſerves, one would hardly ſuppoſe that their feet were adapted to ſuch perilous achievements; yet, upon a nearer inſpection, the wonder ceaſes, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0209200900:60"/>
we find that Nature has provided them with hoofs well calculated for the purpoſe of climbing, being made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low underneath, with ſharp edges, like the inſide of a ſpoon, which prevents them from ſliding off theſe rocky eminences.</p>
               <p>The Goat is an animal eaſily ſuſtained, and is chiefly therefore the property of thoſe who inhabit wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated regions, where it finds an ample ſupply of food from the ſpontaneous productions of Nature, in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations inacceſſible to other creatures. It delights ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the heathy mountains, or the ſhrubby rock, than the fields cultivated by human induſtry. Its favourite food is the tops of the boughs, or the tender bark of young trees. It bears a warm climate better than the Sheep, and frequently ſleeps expoſed to the hotteſt rays of the ſun.</p>
               <p>The milk of the Goat is ſweet, nouriſhing, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal, being found highly beneficial in conſumptive caſes: It is not ſo apt to curdle upon the ſtomach as that of the Cow. From the ſhrubs and heath on which it feeds, the milk of the Goat acquires a flavour and wildneſs of taſte very different from that of either the Sheep or Cow, and is highly pleaſing to ſuch as have accuſtomed themſelves to its uſe: It is made into whey for thoſe whoſe digeſtion is too weak to bear it in its primitive ſtate. Several places in the North of England and the mountainous parts of Scotland are much reſorted to for the purpoſe of drinking the milk of the Goat, and its effects have been generally ſalutary in vitiated and debilitated habits.</p>
               <p>In many parts of Ireland, and in the Highlands of Scotland, their Goats make the chief poſſeſſions of the inhabitants; and in moſt of the mountainous parts of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0209200900:61"/>
Europe, ſupply the natives with many of the neceſſaries of life: They lie upon beds made of their ſkins, which are ſoft, clean, and wholeſome; they live upon their milk, and oat bread; they convert part of it into butter, and ſome into cheeſe. The fleſh of the kid, which they do not allow themſelves to taſte, is conſidered by the city epicure as a great rarity; and, when properly prepared, is eſteemed by ſome as little inferior to veniſon.</p>
               <p>The Goat produces generally two young at a time, ſometimes three, rarely four: In warmer climates, it is more prolific, and produces four or five at once; though the breed is found to degenerate. The male is capable of propagating at one year old, and the female at ſeven months; but the fruits of a generation ſo premature, are generally weak and defective: Their beſt time is at the age of two years, or eighteen months at leaſt. The Goat is a ſhort-lived animal, full of ardour, but ſoon enervated. His appetite for the female is exceſſive, ſo that one buck is ſufficient for one hundred and fifty females.</p>

Some of theſe horns have been found at leaſt two yards long. The head of the Ibex is ſmall, adorned with a large duſky beard, and has a thick coat of hair of a tawny colour mixed with aſh; a ſtreak of black runs along the top of its back; the belly and thighs are of a delicate fawn colour.</p>
               <p>The Ibex inhabits the higheſt Alps of the Griſons' country, and the Vallais; and is alſo found in Crete.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0209200900:63"/>
They are very wild, and difficult to be ſhot, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep on the higheſt points of the rocks. The chaſe of them is attended with great danger: Being very ſtrong, they often turn upon the incautious huntſman, and tumble him down the precipice, unleſs he have time to lie down, and let the animal paſs over him. They bring forth one young at a time, ſeldom two; and are ſaid not to be long-lived.</p>

                  <figure/> THE CHAMOIS GOAT.</head>
               <p>The Chamois, though a wild animal, is very eaſily tamed, and docile; and to be found only in rocky and mountainous places. It is about the ſize of a domeſtic Goat, and reſembles one in many reſpects. It is moſt agreeably lively, and active beyond expreſſion. The
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0209200900:64"/>
hair is ſhort, like that of the Doe; in ſpring it is of an aſh colour, in autumn a dun colour, inclining to black, and in winter of a blackiſh brown. This ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is found in great plenty in the mountains of Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiny, of Piedmont, Savoy, Switzerland, and Germany. They are peaceful, gentle creatures, and live in ſociety with each other. They are found in flocks of from four to fourſcore, and even an hundred, diſperſed upon the crags of the mountains. The large males are ſeen feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing detached from the reſt, except in rutting time, when they approach the females, and drive away the young. The time of their coupling is from the beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember to the end of October; and they bring forth in April and March. The young keep with the dam for about five months, and ſometimes longer, if the hunters and the wolves do not ſeparate them. It is aſſerted, that they live between twenty and thirty years. Their fleſh is good to eat; and they are found to have ten or twelve pounds of ſuet, which far ſurpaſſes that of the Goat in hardneſs and goodneſs. The Chamois has ſcarce any cry, as moſt animals are known to have; if it has any, it is a kind of feeble bleat, by which the parent calls its young: But in caſes of danger, and when it is to warn the reſt of the flock, it uſes an hiſſing noiſe, which is heard at a great diſtance: For it is to be obſerved, that this creature is extremely vigilant, and has an eye the quickeſt and moſt piercing in nature. Its ſmell alſo is not leſs diſtinguiſhing. When it ſees its enemy diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſtops for a moment; and then, if the perſon be near, in an inſtant after it flies off. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by its ſmell, it can diſcover a man at half a league diſtance, and gives the earlieſt notice. Upon any alarm,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0209200900:65"/>
therefore, or any apprehenſions of danger, the Chamois begins his hiſſing rote with ſuch force, that the rocks and the foreſts re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cho to the ſound. The firſt hiſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues as long as the time of one inſpiration: In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it is very ſharp, and deeper towards the cloſe. The animal having, after this firſt alarm, repoſed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, again looks round, and, perceiving the reality of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fears, continues to hiſs by intervals, until it has ſpread the alarm to a very great diſtance. During this time it ſeems in the moſt violent agitation; it ſtrikes the ground with its fore-ſoo, and ſometimes with both; it bounds from rock to rock; it turns and looks round; it runs to the edge of the precipice; and, ſtill perceiving the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, flies with all its ſpeed. The hiſſing of the male is much louder and ſharper than that of the female; it is performed through the noſe, and is properly no more than a very ſtrong breath driven violently through a ſmall aperture.</p>
               <p>The Chamois feeds upon the beſt herbage, and chuſes the moſt delicate parts of the plants, the flowers, and the tender buds. It is not leſs delicate with regard to ſeveral aromatic herbs, which grow upon the ſides of the mountains. It drinks but very little while it feeds upon the ſucculent herbage, and chews the cud in the intervals of feeding.</p>
               <p>This animal is greatly admired for the beauty of its eyes, which are round and ſparkling, and which mark the warmth of its conſtitution. Its head is furniſhed with two ſmall horns of about half a foot long, of a beautiful black, and riſing from the forehead almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the eyes: Theſe, contrary to what is found in other animals, inſtead of going backwards or ſideways,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0209200900:66"/>
ſtand forward, and bend a little backward at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, ending in a very ſharp point. The ears are placed in a very elegant manner, near the horns; and there are two ſtripes of black on each ſide of the face, the reſt being of a whitiſh yellow, which never changes. The horns of the female are leſs, and not ſo much bent; the natives have been known to bleed cattle with them.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are ſo much incommoded by heat, that they are never found in ſummer, except in the caverns of rocks, amidſt fragments of unmelted ice, under the ſhade of high and ſpreading trees, or of rough and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precipices, that face the North, and which keep off entirely the rays of the ſun. They go to paſture both morning and evening, and ſeldom during the heat of the day. They run along the rocks with great eaſe and ſeeming indifference, and leap from one to another, ſo that no Dogs are able to purſue them. There is nothing more extraordinary than to ſee them climbing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſending precipices, that to all other quadrupeds are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible: They always mount or deſcend in an oblique direction; and throw themſelves down a rock of thirty feet, and light with great ſecurity upon ſome excreſcence or fragment, on the ſide of the precipice, which is juſt large enough to place their feet upon; they ſtrike the rock, however, in their deſcent with their feet, three or four times, to ſtop the velocity of their motion; and, when they have got upon the baſe below, they at once ſeem fixed and ſecure. In fact, to ſee them jump in this manner, they ſeem rather to have wings than legs. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that their legs are formed for this arduous employment; the hinder being rather longer than the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0209200900:67"/>
former, and bending in ſuch a manner, that, when they deſcend upon them, they break the force of the fall.</p>
               <p>During the rigours of winter, the Chamois ſleeps in the thicker foreſts, and feeds upon the ſhrubs and the buds of the pine-tree. It ſometimes turns up the ſnow with its foot, to look for herbage; and, where it is green, makes a delicious repaſt. The more craggy and uneven the foreſt, the more this animal is pleaſed with the abode, which thus adds to its ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The hunting the Chamois is very laborious, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult. The moſt uſual way is to hide behind the clefts of the rocks, and ſhoot them. Some alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this animal as they do the Stag, by placing proper perſons at all the paſſages of a glade or valley, and then ſending in others to rouſe the game. Dogs are quite uſeleſs in this chace, as they rather alarm than overtake: Nor is it without danger even to the men; for it often happens, that when the animal finds itſelf overpreſſed, it drives at the hunter with its head, and often tumbles him down the neighbouring precipice. This animal cannot go upon ice when ſmooth; but if there be the leaſt inequalities on its ſurface, it then bounds along in ſecurity, and quickly evades all purſuit.</p>
               <p>The ſkin of the Chamois was once famous, when tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for its ſoftneſs and warmth; at preſent, however, ſince the art of tanning has been brought to greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the leather called ſhammoy is made alſo from thoſe of the tame Goat, the Sheep, and the Deer.</p>

Its ears are long and pendulous. The male is furniſhed with horns, curiouſly twiſted, which proceed horizontally from each ſide of the head, forming a ſcrew; thoſe of the female are ſhorter, and encircle the ear ſomewhat like thoſe of the common Ram. They inhabit the rocky mountains of Pontus, where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience a conſiderable degree of cold, and might thrive in Britain as well as in their native country. The ſame might be ſaid of the Goat of Thibet, ſo famous for the fineneſs of its wool: It lives in a climate colder than ours in winter, and might probably be tranſplanted with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>In Portugal, there is a breed of fine large Goats, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for yielding a great quantity of milk, a gallon

and a half per day: Theſe, if introduced into our navy, might be of infinite ſervice in long voyages.</p>
               <p>Experiments of this kind would certainly be attended with many great advantages; and it were much to be wiſhed, that the great and opulent would employ ſome portion of their time and affluence in procuring, from diſtant countries, ſuch uſeful animals as would propagate in our iſland, and are yet unknown in it: By this mean, many of our lofty mountains might contribute to ſupport a variety of uſeful creatures, that would at the ſame time beautify the moſt barren and rugged parts of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the principal varieties of the Goat kind, of which there are others of leſs note; ſuch as the African Goat, or Buck of Juda, which is much ſmaller than the domeſtic kind, being not much larger than a Hare, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fat, and its fleſh well taſted; the horns are ſhort, ſmooth, and turn a little forward: It is common in Guinea, Angola, and all along the coaſt of Africa.</p>

               <p>ARE a numerous and beautiful race of animals, inhabiting the hotteſt parts of the globe. They are claſſed by ſyſtematic writers with the Goat kind, and like them have hollow horns, which they never caſt; in other reſpects, they greatly reſemble the Deer, eſpecially in the elegance of their form, and the ſwiftneſs of their motions. They are of a reſtleſs and timid diſpoſition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably agile, and moſt of their boundings ſo light and elaſtic, as to ſtrike the ſpectators with aſtoniſhment.

               <p>The diſtinguiſhing marks of this tribe of animals, in which they differ both from the Goat and Deer, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally theſe:—Their horns are different, being annulated or ringed round, and at the ſame time marked with lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudinal depreſſions or ſurrows, running from the baſe to the point: Beſides the extreme beauty and meekneſs of its aſpect, the Gazelle is more delicately and finely limbed than the Roe-buck; its hair is finer and more gloſſy; its ſwiftneſs is ſo great, that the Greyhound, the fleeteſt of Dogs, is unequal to the courſe, and the ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is obliged to call in the aid of the Falcon, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trained to the work, ſeizes on the animal, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes its motion, ſo as to enable the Dogs to overtake it. In India and Perſia, a ſort of Leopard is ſometimes made uſe of in the chaſe, which takes its prey by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its ſprings; but ſhould he fail in his firſt eſſay, the game eſcapes.</p>

                  <figure/> THE BOSCH-BOK, OR WOOD GOAT.</head>
               <p>We are indebted to the indefatigable labours of Dr Sparrman for an accurate deſcription of this rare animal, which is found in the country about the Cape of Good Hope, and is the only one among the African Gazelles, that can be properly ſaid to live in the woods and groves, from whence it derives its name.</p>
               <p>The horns of this animal are black, ſomewhat more than ten inches long, and have three ſides wreathed in a ſpiral direction towards the top; at the bottom they are rough, in conſequence of a number of wavy rings, which however are not elevated much above the ſurface; at the top they are round, ſharp-pointed, and in that part as ſmooth as if they had been poliſhed; their poſition is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame line with the forehead, inclining a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forwards, and, by means of the twiſt they make, recede from each other towards the middle; they are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0209200900:75"/>
there three inches and a half diſtant; at the baſe they are only one inch.</p>
               <p>The Wood Goat is ſomewhat more than two feet and a half high, of a dark-brown colour, in ſome parts bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon black; on each cheek-bone there are two large round white ſpots; another, ſtill larger, occupies the fore part of the neck, ſomewhat below the top of the windpipe; and ſeveral ſmaller white ſpots are ſcattered over the haunches; a narrow line of white hair extends from the neck all along the back and tail, but is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed, being hid by the length of the dark-brown hairs on the top of the back, which are three or four inches long, ſo as to form a kind of mane; the hair on the head is very ſhort and fine, in other parts of the body it is longer, reſembling that of Goats; its tail is not more than a finger's breadth in length, covered with long hairs, which extend down the hind part of the thighs and buttocks; the legs and feet are ſlender; the fetlock joints are likewiſe ſmall; the noſe and under lip, which are white, are decorated with black whiſkers about an inch long.</p>
               <p>As this creature runs but ſlowly, he is ſometimes caught with Dogs: When he finds there is no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, he boldly puts himſelf into a poſture of defence; and, when going to butt, kneels down, and in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition fells his life at a very dear rate, killing and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the beſt and moſt ſpirited hounds. Its horns, which are its chief defence, ſometimes prove its bane, by entangling it in the buſhes; to avoid this, it carries its noſe horizontally and ſtraight forward while it runs, ſo that they lie directly on its neck. The female, which is without horns, on that account runs more freely through
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0209200900:76"/>
the foreſts, and does not ſuffer herſelf ſo eaſily to be hunted out of the woods, having there, as well as on the plains, much greater ſecurity againſt the Dogs in her ſwiftneſs, than the male has in his horns, eſpecially as ſhe is not ſo bulky and heavy as the male. Her breaſt is ſaid to be very plump; but the fleſh of this animal is not very tender.</p>

                  <figure/> THE SPRING-BOK.</head>
               <p>The <hi>White Antelope,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be the ſame with the <hi>Pygarg,</hi> mentioned in the book of Numbers, is an inhabitant of the Cape of Good Hope, where it is called the <hi>Spring-bok;</hi> and is to be ſeen in herds of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thouſands, covering the plains as far as the eye can reach. Sparrman ſays, that, having ſhot at a large herd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0209200900:77"/>
of them, they formed a line, and immediately made a circular movement, as if to ſurround him; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards flew off in different directions.</p>
               <p>The height of this beautiful creature is two feet and a half; and, from the ears to the tail, ſomewhat above three feet: The tail is rather leſs than a foot long: The length of the ears is ſix inches and a half; that of the horns, meaſuring them along their curvatures, nine inches; and their diſtance at the baſe, where they are nearly three inches thick, is one inch; they gradually widen from thence to the diſtance of five inches from each other, when they turn inwards, ſo that at the tip they are not above three inches and a half aſunder; they are of a deep black colour, annulated above half way up; toward the top they are quite ſmooth, and end in a ſharp point.</p>
               <p>The predominant colour of this animal is brown, or a light-ruſt colour; the poſterior moiety of the ridge of the back is white, which colour is continued over and round the anus, the inſide of the haunches, the belly, and the fore legs, excepting a narrow ſtripe of brown in the front of each; the head is white, except a dark-brown liſt on each ſide, of the breadth of an inch, which paſſes from the corner of the mouth over the eyes to the horns; a ſtripe, an inch and a half broad, of the ſame deep umber colour, extends from the ſhoulders to the haunches, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus a boundary between the ſnowy whiteneſs of the belly and the ruſty colour of the ſides: The tail, at leaſt the lower part of it, is not thicker than a gooſe-quill; the under ſide is quite bare; but towards the tip there are a few dark-brown hairs from one to two inches and a half long: The ears are of an aſh colour, tipt on the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0209200900:78"/>
edges with fine light-grey hairs: The eye-brows and whiſkers are black: The hair in general is fine and ſhort; but the dark fine which borders upon the white, conſiſts of longer hairs, and in ſome meaſure ſerves to cover the dazzling whiteneſs of the creature's back, the purity of which ſeems to be by this means preſerved; for on certain occaſions the animal is able to expand theſe hairs to the breadth of eight or nine inches, particularly on taking a high leap, which it never fails to do when it is purſued; and then it is no leſs pleaſant than curious to ſee the whole herd jumping over each other's heads to the height of two yards, and ſometimes higher; ſome of them will take three or four high leaps ſucceſſively: In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſeem to be ſuſpended in the air, and look over their ſhoulders at their purſuers; at the ſame time ſhewing the white part of their backs in a moſt beautiful manner.</p>
               <p>When hunted, theſe animals ſuffer themſelves ſoon to be diſperſed; and when the whole flock has got to ſome diſtance, they will all make a ſtand, and turn round to look at their purſuers, at the ſame time expanding the white hairs on their backs.</p>
               <p>The Spring-boks are ſo extremely ſwift, as to require a good Horſe to overtake them; although they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bold enough to allow a ſportſman, either on foot or on horſeback, to come within gunſhot of them.— Their fleſh is very palatable, and has a more juicy and delicate taſte than that of the other Gazelles.</p>

                  <figure/> THE ELK-ANTELOPE</head>
               <p>is likewiſe an inhabitant of the Cape, as well as the greateſt part of India, and is one of the larger kinds of Gazelles; has ſtraight horns, two feet in length, of a dark-brown colour, marked with two prominent ſpiral ribs running near two-thirds of their length, but ſmooth towards the ends, which are turned a little inwards; the forehead is flat and broad at the top, but about the eyes becomes narrow; it has a forelock, ſtanding erect the length of the whole forehead; its noſe is ſharp; and its breaſt is covered with a looſe ſkin.</p>
               <p>This animal is of an aſh colour, inclining a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards blue; has a thin upright mane, quite black, which extends from the nape of its neck along the top of the back; and has likewiſe a tuft of black hair at the end of the tail.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0209200900:80"/>The Elk-antelopes live chiefly in plains and vallies; and when hunted, always run, if poſſible, againſt the wind: They are not very ſwift; and being in general fat, eſpecially the males, which are always the largeſt and fatteſt in the herd, are ſoon tired. The hunter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally endeavours to get to the windward of the animal, which when he has accompliſhed, he takes an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of throwing himſelf from his horſe, and inſtantly ſhoots the flying game; at this practice the Dutch colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts at the Cape are ſo expert, as ſeldom to fail.—Sparr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in his account of this animal, ſays, there have been many inſtances where keen ſportſmen, as well for their own pleaſure as convenience, have hunted Elk-antelopes and other Gazelles, for many miles together, from the open plains, and driven them to their own doors, before they thought it worth while to ſhoot them.</p>
               <p>The female has horns like the male, but ſmaller: They are uſed by the Hottentots for tobacco-pipes.</p>

                  <figure/> THE HART-BEEST</head>
               <p>is the moſt common of all the larger Gazelles, known in any part of Africa.—The following accurate deſcription is taken from Sparrman, to whom we are indebted for the beſt accounts of ſuch of theſe rare animals as are to be met with near the Cape:—The height of this animal is ſomewhat above four feet; the horns are from ſix to nine inches long, very ſtrong and black, almoſt cloſe, at the baſe diverging upwards, and at the top bending backwards in an horizontal direction almoſt to the tips, which turn a little downwards; they are emboſſed with about eighteen rings of an irregular form. The general colour of the Hart-beeſt is that of cinnamon; the front of the head is marked with black, as is likewiſe the fore part of the legs; the hind part of the haunch is covered with a wide black ſtreak, which reaches down to the knee; a narrow ſtripe of black begins behind each ear,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0209200900:82"/>
and runs all along the ridge of the neck; a dark-brown oval ſpot extends over the back, terminating juſt above the tail, which is ſlender, ſomething like that of an Aſs, and is covered with ſtrong black hairs about ſix inches long. There is a pore about an inch below the eye, from which a matter is diſtilled, ſomewhat like ear-wax, which the Hottentots carefully preſerve as a rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent medicine.</p>
               <p>This animal is ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Bubalus</hi> of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, is the <hi>Cervine Antelope</hi> of Mr Pennant, and the <hi>Bubale</hi> of M. Buffon.</p>
               <p>The hair of the Hart-beeſt is very fine, and its long ears are covered with white hair on the inſide; it has only eight teeth in the lower jaw, none in the upper; the legs are rather ſlender, with ſmall fetlocks and hoofs.</p>
               <p>The large head and high forehead, together with the aſſinine ears and tail of the Hart-beeſt, render it one of the leaſt handſome of the whole tribe of Antelopes: Its pace, when at full ſpeed, appears like a heavy gallop; notwithſtanding which, it runs as faſt as any of the large Antelopes: When it has once got a-head of its purſuers, it is very apt to turn round, and ſtare them full in the face. Its fleſh is fine, rather dry, but yet of an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly high flavour.</p>

               <p>is a beautiful, tall Gazelle, inhabiting the Cape of Good Hope; has long, ſlender ſhanks; is larger, though not ſo clumſy, as the Elk-antelope: Its horns are ſmooth, twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirally, with a prominent edge or rib following the wreaths; they are three feet nine inches long, of a pale-brown colour, cloſe at the baſe, and at the points round
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0209200900:83"/>
and ſharp. The colour of this animal is a ruſty brown; along the ridge of the back there is a white ſtripe mixed with brown; from this are eight or nine white ſtripes pointing downwards; the forehead and the fore part of the noſe are brown; a white ſtripe runs from the corner of each eye, and meets juſt above the noſe; upon each check-bone there are two ſmall white ſpots; the inner edges of the ears are covered with white hair, and the upper part of the neck is adorned with a brown mane, an inch long; beneath the neck, from the throat to the breaſt, are ſome long hairs hanging down; the breaſt and belly are grey; the tail is two feet long, brown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, white beneath, and black at the end.</p>
               <p>The Koedoe, though a tall and ſlender animal, is not ſo ſwift as many of the Gazelle kind, and is eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the hounds: On theſe occaſions the males de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves with great ſpirit with their horns, and will come to cloſe quarters with the Dogs; but the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males having no horns, are obliged to depend on their ſpeed.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0209200900:84"/>This animal is famous for a concretion in its ſtomach or inteſtines, called the oriental bezoar, which was well known in former times for its great virtue in expelling poiſon in the human frame, and was ſold at enormous prices, its value encreaſing in proportion to its ſize. There was a time when a ſtone of four ounces ſold in Europe for above 200 l.; at preſent, however, its eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and price are greatly decreaſed. The virtues which ignorance and inexperience attributed to it, are now found no longer to exiſt; and this once-celebrated medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is now only conſumed in countries where the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature has been but little advanced.—Similar concretions are likewiſe found in a variety of animals of the Gazelle and Goat kind; even Apes, Serpents, and Hogs, are ſaid to have their bezoars: In ſhort, there is ſcarcely an animal, except of the carnivorous kind, that does not produce ſome of theſe concretions in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, inteſtines, kidnies, and even the heart.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal animals of the Gazelle kind deſcribed by Dr Sparrman in his voyage to the Cape of Good Hope: He mentions a variety of others that are to be met with there, of which he gives us little but their names.</p>

               <p>In Ceylon, there is an animal of this kind called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minna,</hi> which is not larger than a hare, but perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Fallow-deer.—It is of a grey colour; the ſides and haunches are ſpotted and barred with white; its ears are long and open; and its tail ſhort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0209200900:91"/>None of theſe ſmall animals can ſubſiſt but in a warm climate. They are ſo extremely delicate, that it is with the utmoſt difficulty they can be brought alive into Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, where they ſoon periſh. They are gentle, familiar, moſt beautifully formed, and their agility is ſuch, that they will bound over a wall twelve feet high.

               <head>THE SCYTHIAN ANTELOPE, OR SAIGA,</head>
               <p>which is the only one of the ſpecies that is to be found in Europe.—The form of its body reſembles the domeſtic Goat, but its horns are thoſe of an Antelope, being marked by very prominent rings, with furrows between; they are a foot long, the ends ſmooth, of a pale-yellow colour, almoſt tranſparent.</p>
               <p>The male is covered with rough hair, like the He-Goat, and has a ſtrong ſcent; the female is ſmoother, hornleſs, and timid. The general colour is a dirty white.</p>
               <p>When they are attacked by Wolves or Dogs, the males ſtand round the females, forming a circle, with their heads towards the enemy, in which poſture they defend their charge.—Their common pace is a trot; when they go faſter, it is by leaps; and are ſwifter than Roe-bucks. When they feed, they are obliged to go backward, owing to the length of the upper lip, which they lift up.— Their ſkin is ſoft, and excellent for gloves, belts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They are found in flocks from ſix to ten thouſand, on the banks of the Tanais and Boriſthenes.</p>
               <p>The young are eaſily tamed, and will readily return to their maſter when turned out on the deſart.</p>

                  <figure/> THE NYL-GHAU.</head>
               <p>THIS animal is a native of the interior parts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia. —It ſeems to be of a middle nature, between the Cow and the Deer, and carries the appearance of both in its form. In ſize, it is as much ſmaller than the one, as it is larger than the other: Its body, horns, and tail, are not unlike thoſe of a bull; and the head, neck, and legs, are very like thoſe of a Deer. The colour, in general, is aſh or grey, from a mixture of black hairs and white; all along the ridge or edge of the neck, the hair is blacker, longer, and more erect, making a ſhort, thin, and upright mane, reaching down to the hump. Its horns are ſeven inches long, ſix inches round at the root, tapering by degrees, and terminate in a blunt point.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0209200900:93"/>
The ears are large and beautiful, ſeven inches in length, and ſpread to a conſiderable breadth near their end: They are white on the edge and on the inſide, except where two black bands mark the hollow of the ear with a Zebra-like variety. The height of this animal at the ſhoulder is four feet one inch; behind the loins, it only meaſures four feet.</p>
               <p>The female differs conſiderably from the male both in height and thickneſs, being much ſmaller; in ſhape and colour very much reſembling a Deer; and has no horns. She has four nipples; and is ſuppoſed to go nine months with young. She commonly has one at a birth, but ſometimes two.</p>
               <p>Several of this ſpecies were brought to this country in the year 1767, which continued to breed annually for ſome years after.—Dr Hunter, who had one of them in his cuſtody for ſome time, deſcribes it as a harmleſs and gentle animal; that is ſeemed pleaſed with every kind of familiarity, always licked the hand that either ſtroaked or fed it, and never once attempted to uſe its horns of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively. It ſeemed to have much dependence on its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of ſmell; and ſnuffed keenly whenever any perſon came in ſight: It did ſo likewiſe, when food or drink was brought to it; and would not taſte the bread which was offered, if the hand that preſented it happened to ſmell of turpentine.</p>
               <p>Its manner of fighting is very particular, and is thus deſcribed:—Two of the males at Lord Clive's, being put into an incloſure, were obſerved, while they were at ſome diſtance from each other, to prepare for the attack, by falling down upon their knees. They then ſhuffled towards each other, keeping ſtill upon their knees; and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0209200900:94"/>
at the diſtance of a few yards, they made a ſpring, and darted againſt each other with great force.</p>
               <p>The following anecdote will ſerve to ſhew, that, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rutting ſeaſon, theſe animals are fierce and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and not to be depended upon:—A labouring man, without knowing that the animal was near him, went up to the outſide of the incloſure; the Nyl-ghau, with the quickneſs of lightning, darted againſt the wood-work with ſuch violence, that he broke it to pieces, and broke off one of his horns cloſe to the root. The death of the animal, which happened ſoon after, was ſuppoſed to be owing to the injury he ſuſtained by the blow.</p>
               <p>Bernier ſays, that it is the favourite amuſement of the Mogul emperor to hunt the Nyl-ghau; and that he kills them in ſuch numbers, as to diſtribute quarters of them to all his omrahs; which ſhews that they are eſteemed good and delicious food.</p>
               <p>The Nyl-ghau is frequently brought from the interior parts of Aſia as a rare and valuable preſent to the nabobs and other great men at our ſettlements in India.</p>
               <p>It remains to be conſidered, whether this rare animal might not be propagated with ſucceſs in this country. That it will breed here is evident from experience; and if it ſhould prove docile enough to be eaſily trained to labour, its great ſwiftneſs and conſiderable ſtrength might be applied to the moſt valuable purpoſes.</p>

                  <figure/> THE MUSK.</head>
               <p>THERE have been various accounts given of this animal by naturaliſts and travellers; by whom it ſeems to have been taken notice of more for the perfume which it produces, than for the information of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enquirer into its nature and qualities: For we are ſtill at a loſs what rank to aſſign it among the various tribes of quadrupeds. It has no horns; and whether it ruminates or not is uncertain: But by its wanting the fore-teeth in the upper jaw, we are led to ſuppoſe that it belongs either to the Goat or the Deer kind; and have therefore given it a place after the Gazelles, relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe characteriſtic marks which are known, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to future hiſtorians, who may be poſſeſſed of better means of information, to aſcertain its genuine character.</p>
               <p>The Muſk of Thibet reſembles the Roe-buck in form: It is ſomewhat above two feet in height at the ſhoulder; the hind legs are longer than the fore legs, being two
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0209200900:96"/>
feet nine inches high from the top of the haunches; in length, it is three feet ſix inches from the head to the tail; the head is above half a foot long. Its upper jaw is much larger than the lower; and on each ſide of it there is a ſlender tuſk, near two inches long, which hangs down, bending inwards like a hook, and very ſharp on the inner edge: Its lower jaw contains eight ſmall cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teeth; and in each jaw there are ſix grinders. Its ears are long, ſmall, and erect, like thoſe of a Rabbit. The hair on the whole body is long and rough, marked with ſmall waves from top to bottom; the colour is a ruſty-brown; under the belly and tail it is white; on each ſide of the lower jaw there is a tuft of thick hair, about an inch long; its hoofs are deeply cloven, ſlender, and black; the ſpurious hoofs are likewiſe very long; its tail is not more than two inches in length, and hid in the hair.—The uſe it makes of its tuſks is not well known: The moſt probable is that of hooking up roots out of the ground, and catching at ſmall twigs and branches of trees, upon which it feeds.—The female has no tuſks, is leſs than the male, and has two ſmall teats.</p>
               <p>The Muſk is found in the kingdom of Thibet, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Chineſe provinces, about the lake Baikal, and near the rivers Jeniſan and Argun, from lat. 60 to 45; but ſeldom ſo far ſouth, except driven by great falls of ſnow to ſeek for food in more temperate climates. It is naturally a timid animal, and endowed with a quick ſenſe of hearing. Its ſolitary haunts are uſually moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, covered with pines; where it avoids mankind, and, when purſued, flies to the higheſt and moſt inacceſſible ſummits.</p>
               <p>The perfume produced by this animal, which is ſo well
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0209200900:97"/>
known in the faſhionable circles, and of late ſo much uſed in the practice of phyſic, needs little deſcription: It is found in a bag or tumor, nearly of the ſize of a hen's egg, on the belly of the male only. Theſe bags the hunters cut off, and tie them up for ſale; many thouſands of which are ſent over annually to Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what are conſumed in different parts of the Eaſt. To account for this great conſumption, it is ſuppoſed that the muſk is frequently adulterated and mixed with the blood of the animal. It comes to us from China, Tonquin, Bengal, and Muſcovy; but that of Thibet is reckoned the beſt, and ſells at a much higher price.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the males, eſpecially in the rutting ſeaſon, is much infected with the flavour of the muſk; but is, nevertheleſs, eaten by the Ruſſians and Tartars.</p>

               <p>THIS animal (the exiſtence of which has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been called in queſtion) is a native of the wild and unfrequented deſarts of Ethiopia, and other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior parts of Africa; where it leads a ſolitary life, far from the habitations of men, for whoſe uſe it is rendered unfit by the enormous diſproportion of its parts. It has hitherto been regarded chiefly as an object of curioſity; and may lead us to admire the wonderful productions of that creative Power which has filled the earth with life in ſuch a boundleſs variety of forms.</p>
               <p>The height of this extraordinary animal, from the crown of the head to the ground, is ſeventeen feet; while at the rump it only meaſures nine feet; the neck
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0209200900:99"/>
alone is ſeven feet long; and the length, from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the tail to the end of the noſe, is twenty-two feet; the fore and hind legs are nearly of an equal height; but the ſhoulders are of ſuch a length, as to make its back incline like the roof of a houſe; its neck is ſlender and elegant, adorned on the upper ſide with a ſhort mane; its head is nearly ſimilar to that of a Stag, having two horns, ſix inches long, covered with hair, with tufts at the end like briſtles; on the middle of the forehead ſtands a protuberance, about two inches high, reſembling a third horn; its ears are long; and its eyes large and beautiful.</p>
               <p>The colour of this animal is a dirty white, interſperſed with large ſpots of yellow over the whole body; it is a timid and gentle creature, but not ſwift; from the great length of its fore legs, it is obliged to divide them to a great diſtance when it grazes, which it does with great difficulty; it lives chiefly by browſing on the leaves and tender branches of trees; it lies on its belly, and has hard protuberances on its breaſt and thighs, like the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel; its tail is long, ſlender, and covered with ſtrong hairs; its feet reſemble thoſe of an Ox; it has no teeth in the upper jaw, and is a ruminating animal; its pace is a kind of gallop.</p>
               <p>This animal was known to the Romans in early times, by whom its hiſtory has been handed down to ſucceeding ages in ſome of their moſt celebrated works of ſculpture: It was exhibited in their games among other rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common animals; and is finely and juſtly deſcribed by Oppian.</p>

                  <figure/> THE ELK.</head>
               <p>THIS animal is the largeſt and moſt formidable of all the Deer kind. It is a native of both the old and the new continent, being known in Europe by the name of the <hi>Elk,</hi> and in America by that of the <hi>Mooſe-deer.</hi> It is ſometimes taken in the foreſts of Ruſſia and Germany, though rarely to be ſeen on account of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme wildneſs. It likewiſe inhabits Norway, Sweden, Poland, and Tartary, as far as the North of China. It is common in Canada, and in all the northern parts of America, where it is called by the French the <hi>Original.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Elk has been variouſly deſcribed by naturaliſts and travellers: By ſome it is ſaid to be twelve feet high; whilſt others, with greater appearance of probability, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it as being not much higher than a Horſe. It is, however, a matter of doubt to which a greater degree of credibility ſhould be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0209200900:101"/>From a variety of Elks horns preſerved in the cabinets of the curious, ſome of which are of a moſt enormous ſize, there is every reaſon to conclude, that the animal which bore them muſt have been of a proportionable bulk and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who ſpeak of the gigantic Mooſe, ſay, their horns are ſix feet long, and meaſure, from tip to tip, above ten feet: The beams of the horns are ſhort; from which they ſpread out into large and broad palms, one ſide of which is plain, but on the outſide are ſeveral ſharp ſnags or ſhoots.</p>
               <p>The European Elk grows to the height of ſeven or eight feet, and in length, from the end of the muzzle to the inſertion of the tail, meaſures ten feet; the head is two feet long; the neck, on which is a ſhort, upright mane, of a light-brown colour, is much ſhorter; its eye is ſmall, and from the lower corner of it there is a deep ſlit, common to all the Deer kind, as well as moſt of the Gazelles; the ears are upwards of a foot in length, very broad, and ſomewhat ſlouching; the noſtrils are wide; and the upper lip, which is ſquare, and has a deep furrow in the middle, hangs greatly over the lower, from whence it was imagined by the ancients, that this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not graze without going backward; the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are very high, the hind legs much ſhorter than the fore legs, and the hoofs deeply cloven; from a ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence under the throat hangs a long tuft of coarſe black hair; the tail is very ſhort, duſky above, and white beneath; the hair is long and rough, like a bear, and of a hoary brown colour, not much differing from that of the Aſs.</p>
               <p>The pace of the Elk is a high, ſhambling trot; but it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0209200900:102"/>
goes with great ſwiftneſs.—Formerly theſe animals were made uſe of in Sweden to draw ſledges; but as they were frequently acceſſary to the eſcape of ſuch as had been guilty of murders or other great crimes, this uſe of them was prohibited under great penalties.</p>
               <p>In paſſing through thick woods, theſe animals carry their heads horizontally, to prevent their horns being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the branches.</p>
               <p>The Elks are timid, inoffenſive animals, except when wounded, or during the rutting ſeaſon, when the males become very furious, and at that time will ſwim from iſle to iſle in purſuit of the females. They ſtrike with both horns and hoofs; and poſſeſs ſuch agility and ſtrength of limbs, that with a ſingle blow of the fore feet they will kill a Wolf or a Dog, or even break a tree.</p>
               <p>Their fleſh is extremely ſweet and nouriſhing. The Indians ſay they can travel farther after eating heartily of the fleſh of the Elk than any other animal food. Their tongues are excellent; but the noſe is eſteemed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delicacy in all Canada. The ſkin makes excellent buff leather; and is ſtrong, ſoft, and light. The Indians make their ſnow-ſhoes, and likewiſe form their canoes, with it. The hair on the neck, withers, and hams, of a full-grown Elk, from its great length and elaſticity, is well adapted to the purpoſe of making matraſſes and ſaddles.</p>
               <p>The methods of hunting theſe animals in Canada are curious:—The firſt, and moſt ſimple, is, before the lakes or rivers are frozen, multitudes of the natives aſſemble in their canoes, with which they form a vaſt creſcent, each horn touching the ſhore; whilſt another party on the ſhore ſurround an extenſive tract: They are attended by Dogs, which they let looſe, and preſs towards the water
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0209200900:103"/>
with loud cries: The animals, alarmed by the noiſe, fly before the hunters, and plunge into the lake, where they are killed by the people in the canoes with lances and clubs.—Another method requires a greater degree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and art:—The hunters incloſe a large ſpace with ſtakes and branches of trees, forming two ſides of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle; the bottom opens into a ſecond incloſure, which is faſt on all ſides: At the opening are hung numbers of ſnares, made of the ſlips of raw hides. They aſſemble, as before, in great troops; and, with all kinds of hideous noiſes, drive into the incloſure not only the Mooſe, but various other kinds of Deer with which that country abounds. Some, in forcing their way through the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſs, are caught in the ſnares by the neck or horns; whilſt thoſe which eſcape theſe, meet their fate from the arrows of the hunters, directed at them from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. —They are likewiſe frequently killed with the gun. When they are firſt diſcovered, they ſquat with their hind parts, and make water; at which inſtant the ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fires. If he miſs, the Mooſe ſets off in a moſt rapid trot, making, like the Rein-deer, a prodigious rattling with its hoofs, and running twenty or thirty miles before it ſtops or takes the water. The uſual time for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is in winter. The animal can run with eaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firm ſurface of the ſnow; but the hunters avoid entering on the chaſe till the heat of the ſun is ſtrong enough to melt the frozen cruſt with which it is covered, and render it ſoft enough to impede the flight of the Mooſe, which ſinks up to the ſhoulders, flounders, and gets on with great difficulty. The ſportſman purſues in his broad-rackets or ſnow-ſhoes, and makes a ready prey of the diſtreſſed animal.</p>

               <p>This extraordinary animal is a native of the icy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the North; where, by a wiſe and bountiful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which diffuſes the common goods of Nature over every part of the habitable globe, it abounds, and is made ſubſervient to the wants of a hardy race of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the countries near the pole, who would find it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0209200900:105"/>
impoſſible to ſubſiſt among their ſnowy mountains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid of this moſt uſeful creature.</p>
               <p>In more temperate regions, men are indebted to the unbounded liberality of Nature for a great variety of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable creatures to ſerve, to nouriſh, and to cloath them. To the poor Laplander the Rein-deer alone ſupplies the place of the Horſe, the Cow, the Sheep, the Goat, &amp;c.; and from it he derives the only comforts that tend to ſoften the ſeverity of his ſituation in that moſt inhoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble climate.</p>
               <p>The Rein-deer of Lapland are of two kinds,—the wild and the tame: The former are larger, ſtronger, and more hardy than the latter; for which reaſon the tame females, in the proper ſeaſon, are often ſent out into the woods, where they meet with wild males, and return home im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by them. The breed from this mixture is ſtronger, and better adapted for drawing the ſledge, to which the Laplanders accuſtom them at an early age.</p>

               <p>They are yoked to it by a collar; from which a trace is brought under the belly between the legs, and faſtened to the fore part of the ſledge. Theſe carriages are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0209200900:106"/>
light, and covered at the bottom with the ſkin of the Rein-deer. The perſon who ſits in it guides the animal with a cord faſtened to its horns; he drives it with a goad, and encourages it with his voice. Thoſe of the wild breed, though by far the ſtrongeſt, often prove refractory; and not only refuſe to obey their maſter, but turn againſt him, and ſtrike ſo furiouſly with their feet, that his only reſource is to cover himſelf with his ſledge, upon which the enraged animal vents its fury. The tame animal, on the contrary, is patient, active, and willing.—When hard puſhed, the Rein-deer will trot the diſtance of ſixty miles without ſtopping; but in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, the poor obedient creature fatigues itſelf ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, that its maſter is frequently obliged to kill it immediately, to prevent a lingering death that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. In general, they can go about thirty miles without ſtopping, and that without any great or dangerous efforts.</p>
               <p>This mode of travelling can be performed only in the winter ſeaſon, when the face of the country is covered with ſnow; and, although the conveyance is ſpeedy, it is inconvenient, dangerous, and troubleſome.</p>
               <p>As the Rein-deer conſtitutes the ſole riches of the Laplander, it may well be ſuppoſed that a conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to preſerve and ſecure it forms the chief employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life. It is no uncommon thing for one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to poſſeſs above five hundred in a ſingle herd.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſummer appears, which forms but a ſhort interval from the moſt piercing cold, the Laplander, who had fed his Rein-deer upon the lower grounds during the winter, drives them up to the mountains, leaving the woody country and the low paſtures, which at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are in a ſtate truly deplorable: Myriads of inſects,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0209200900:107"/>
bred by the heat of the ſun in the woods and fens with which this country abounds, are all upon the wing; the whole atmoſphere ſwarms with life; every place and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature is infeſted; the natives are obliged to cover their faces with a mixture of pitch and milk, to ſhield them from theſe minute invaders, which are drawn in with the breath, and enter the noſtrils, and even the eyes; but they are chiefly enemies to the Rein-deer: The horns of that animal being then tender, and covered with a ſkin, which renders them extremely ſenſitive, a cloud of theſe inſects ſettle upon them, and drive the poor animal almoſt to diſtraction. In this extremity, there is no reſource but flight. The herdſmen drive their flocks from the plains to the ſummits of the mountains, whither the foe cannot follow them. There they will continue the whole day, with little or no food, rather than venture down into the lower parts, where they have no defence againſt their unceaſing perſecutors.</p>
               <p>Beſides the gnat, the gadfly is a common peſt to theſe animals. In the autumn, this inſect depoſits its eggs in their ſkin, where the worms burrow, and wound it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, and often prove fatal to the poor animal. The moment a ſingle fly is ſeen, the whole herd is in motion: They know their enemy, and endeavour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, by toſſing up their heads, and running among each other; but all this too often proves ineffectual.</p>
               <p>Every morning and evening during the ſummer, the herdſman returns to the cottage with his deer to be milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where a large fire of moſs is prepared, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of filling the place with ſmoke, to drive off the gnats, and keep the Deer quiet whilſt milking.—The quantity of milk given by one female in a day is about a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0209200900:108"/>
pint. It is thinner than that of a Cow, but ſweeter and more nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>The female begins to breed at the age of two years, is in ſeaſon the latter end of September, goes with young eight months, and generally brings forth two at a time. —The fondneſs of the dam for her young is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They follow her two or three years, but do not acquire their full ſtrength until four. It is at this age that they are trained to labour; and they continue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable four or five years. They never live above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſixteen years.—At eight or nine years old, the Laplanders kill them for their ſkins and their fleſh. Of the former they make garments, which are warm, and cover them from head to foot; they alſo ſerve them for beds: They ſpread them on each ſide of the fire upon the leaves of trees, and in this manner lie both ſoft and warm. The latter affords a conſtant ſupply of good and wholeſome food, which in the winter, when all other kinds of proviſions fail, is their chief ſubſiſtence. The tongue of the Rein-deer is conſidered as a great delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and when dried, great numbers of them are ſold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other countries. The ſinews ſerve for thread, with which the Laplanders make their cloaths, ſhoes, and other neceſſaries; and, when covered with the hair, ſerve them for ropes.</p>
               <p>Innumerable are the uſes, the comforts, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which the poor inhabitants of this dreary climate derive from this animal. We cannot ſum them up bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in the beautiful language of the poet:—

               </p>
               <p>The horns of the Rein-deer are large and ſlender, bending forward; with brow antlers, which are broad and palmated. A pair in our poſſeſſion are in length two feet eight inches, and from tip to tip two feet five inches; they weigh nine pounds: The projecting brow antler is fourteen inches long, one foot broad, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at the end: It ſhould ſeem, both from its ſituation and form, an excellent inſtrument to remove the ſnow, under which its favourite moſs lies. Both ſexes have horns: Thoſe of the female are leſs, and have fewer branches.</p>
               <p>We are happy in being able to give an accurate repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of this ſingular creature. The drawing was taken from one in the poſſeſſion of Sir H. G. Liddell, Bart. which he brought over from Lapland, with four others, in 1786. The height at the ſhoulder was three feet three inches: The hair on the body was of a dark-brown colour; and on the neck, brown mixed with white: A large tuft of hair, of a dirty-white colour, hung down from the throat, near its cheſt; and it had a large white ſpot on the inſide of each hind leg, cloſe by the joint: Its head was long and fine; and round each eye was a large black ſpace: Its horns were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fine down like velvet. The hoofs of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal are large, broad, and deeply cloven: They ſpread cut to a great breadth on the ground; and, when the animal is in motion, make a crackling noiſe, by being drawn up forcibly together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0209200900:110"/>Not many attempts have been made to draw the Rein-deer from its native mountains, and tranſport it to milder climes; and of theſe, few have ſucceeded. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts from thence have concluded, that it cannot exiſt but amidſt ice and ſnow. M. Buffon regrets the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of procuring the animal alive; and ſays, that when tranſported to another climate it ſoon dies. M. Regnard mentions ſome that were brought to Dantzick; where, being unable to endure the heat of the climate, they all periſhed. Queen Chriſtina of Sweden procured five and twenty, which ſhe purpoſed ſending to Oliver Cromwell: They were brought as far as Stockholm; but the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers who attended them refuſing to come to England, fifteen of the number were killed by the wolves, and the remaining ten did not long ſurvive, the climate being conſidered as too warm.</p>
               <p>To thoſe brought over by Sir H. G. Liddell, five more were added the year following: They produced young ones, and gave promiſing hopes of thriving in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but, by accident or miſmanagement, the ſtock is now (in 1789) reduced to a ſingle female with young. The diſorder of which moſt of them died was ſimilar to what is called the <hi>rot</hi> in Sheep, and is generally attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the too great richneſs of the graſs whereon they fed. Nor can we wonder at the failure of this ſpirited enterprize, when we conſider that it is the ſole employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Laplander to attend and herd his Rein-deer, to drive them in the ſummer time to the ſummits of the mountains, to the ſides of clear lakes and ſtreams, and to lead them where they can find the moſt proper food: Want of knowledge or attention to minute particulars is ſufficient to overturn the beſt-laid plans.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0209200900:111"/>There is, however, little doubt but this animal will live without the Lapland <hi>lichen;</hi> to which, perhaps, it only hath recourſe, becauſe there is in thoſe latitudes no other ſuſtenance during the winter. It is alſo in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land free from its mortal enemy—the gadfly. But as the deſire of poſſeſſing this animal has hitherto been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited only by curioſity, it is not likely that much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be paid to it in a country like this, abounding with ſuch variety of uſeful quadrupeds.</p>
               <p>The Rein-deer is wild in America, where it is called the <hi>Caribou:</hi> It is found in Spitzbergen and Greenland; and is very common in the moſt northern parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and in Aſia as far as Kamtſchatka, where ſome of the richeſt of the natives keep herds of ten or twenty thouſand in number.</p>
               <p>In the neighbourhood of Hudſon's Bay, there are great herds of wild Rein-deer: Columns of eight or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are ſeen annually paſſing from North to South in the months of March and April. In that ſeaſon, the muſkatoes are very troubleſome, and oblige them to quit the woods, and ſeek refreſhment on the ſhore and open country.—Great numbers of beaſts of prey follow the herds: The wolves ſingle out the ſtragglers, detach them from the flock, and hunt them down; the foxes attend at a diſtance to pick up the offals left by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. —In autumn, the Deer, with the fawns bred during the ſummer, remigrate northward.</p>

               <head>
                  <figure/> THE STAG, OR RED DEER,</head>
               <p>is the moſt beautiful animal of the Deer kind. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his form, the lightneſs of his motions, the flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibility of his limbs, his bold, branching horns, which are annually renewed, his grandeur, ſtrength, and ſwiftneſs, give him a decided pre-eminence over every other inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the foreſt.</p>
               <p>The age of the Stag is known by its horns:—The firſt year exhibits only a ſhort protuberance, which is covered with a hairy ſkin; the next year the horns are ſtraight and ſingle; the third year produces two antlers; the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0209200900:113"/>
fourth three; the fifth four; and when arrived at the ſixth year, the antlers amount to ſix or ſeven on each ſide; but the number is not always certain.</p>
               <p>The Stag begins to ſhed his horns the latter end of February, or the beginning of March. Soon after the old horn is fallen off, a ſoft tumour begins to appear, which is ſoon covered with a down like velvet: This tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour every day buds forth like the graft of a tree; and, riſing by degrees, ſhoots out the antlers on each ſide. The ſkin continues to cover it for ſome time, and is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with blood-veſſels, which ſupply the growing horns with nouriſhment, and occaſion the furrows ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in them when that covering is ſtript off: The impreſſion is deeper at the bottom, where the veſſels are larger; and diminiſhes towards the point, where they are as ſmooth and ſolid as ivory. When the horns are at their full growth, they acquire ſtrength and ſolidity; and the velvet covering or ſkin, with its blood-veſſels, dries up, and begins to fall off; which the animal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to haſten, by rubbing its antlers againſt the trees; and in this manner the whole head gradually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires its compleat hardneſs, expanſion, and beauty.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Stags have poliſhed their horns, which is not compleated till July or Auguſt, they quit the thickets, and return to the foreſts: They cry with a loud and tremulous note; and fly from place to place, in ſearch of the females, with extreme ardour: Their necks ſwell; they ſtrike with their horns againſt trees and other obſtacles, and become extremely furious.</p>
               <p>At this ſeaſon, when two Stags meet, their conteſts are often deſperate, and terminate in the defeat or flight of one of them; while the other remains in poſſeſſion of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0209200900:114"/>
his miſtreſs and the field, till another rival approaches, that he is alſo obliged to attack and repel.</p>
               <p>During this time, which uſually laſts about three weeks, the Stag is frequently ſeen by the ſides of rivers and pools of water, where he can quench his thirſt, as well as cool his ardour. He ſwims with great eaſe and ſtrength; and, it is ſaid, will even venture out to ſea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by the Hinds, and ſwim from one iſland to another, though at a conſiderable diſtance.</p>
               <p>The Hinds go with young eight months and a few days; and ſeldom produce more than one young, called a <hi>fawn.</hi> They bring forth in May, or the beginning of June; and conceal their young with great care in the moſt obſcure retreats. They will even expoſe themſelves to the fury of the hounds, and ſuffer all the terrors of the chaſe, in order to draw off the Dogs from their hiding place. The Hind is alſo very bold in the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her offspring, and defends it with great courage againſt her numerous and rapacious enemies: The Wild Cat, the Dog, and even the Wolf, are frequently obliged to give way to her upon theſe occaſions. But what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be ſtrangely unnatural, the Stag himſelf is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently one of her moſt dangerous foes, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the young fawn, if not prevented by the maternal care of the Hind in concealing from his obſervation the place of its retreat.</p>
               <p>The calf never quits the dam during the whole ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and in winter, the Stags and Hinds of all ages keep together in herds, which are more or leſs numerous, according to the mildneſs or rigour of the ſeaſon. They ſeparate in the ſpring; the Hinds retire to bring forth, while none but the young ones remain together.—Stags
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0209200900:115"/>
are gregarious animals, and fond of grazing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: It is danger or neceſſity alone that ſeparates them.</p>
               <p>The uſual colour of the Stag in England is red; in other countries, it is generally brown or yellow. His eye is peculiarly beautiful, ſoft, and ſparkling; his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is quick; and his ſenſe of ſmelling acute. When liſtening, he raiſes his head, erects his ears, and ſeems attentive to every noiſe, which he can hear at a great diſtance. When he approaches a thicket, he ſtops to look round him on all ſides, and attentively ſurveys eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object near him: If the cunning animal perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to alarm him, he moves ſlowly forward; but, on the leaſt appearance of danger, he flies off with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of the wind. He appears to liſten with great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and delight to the ſound of the ſhepherd's pipe, which the hunters ſometimes make uſe of to allure the poor animal to his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Stag eats ſlowly, and is nice in the choice of his paſture. When his ſtomach is full, he lies down to chew the cud at leiſure. This, however, ſeems to be attended with greater exertions than in the Ox or the Sheep; for the graſs is not returned from the firſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach without violent ſtraining, owing to the great length of his neck, and the narrowneſs of the paſſage. This ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is made by a kind of hiccup, which continues during the time of his ruminating.</p>
               <p>The voice of the Stag is ſtronger and more quivering as he advances in age; in the rutting ſeaſon, it is even terrible: That of the Hind is not ſo loud, and is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom heard but when excited by apprehenſion for herſelf or her young.</p>
               <p>The Stag has been ſaid to be an uncommonly long-lived
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0209200900:116"/>
animal; but later obſervations have fully confuted this unfounded opinion. It is a generally received max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, that animals live ſeven times the number of years that bring them to perfection: Thus the Stag being five or ſix years in arriving at maturity, lives ſeven times that number, or from thirty-five to forty years.</p>
               <p>The following fact, recorded in hiſtory, will ſerve to ſhew that the Stag is poſſeſſed of an extraordinary ſhare of courage when his perſonal ſafety is concerned:—Some years ago, William, Duke of Cumberland, cauſed a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a Stag to be incloſed in the ſame area; and the Stag made ſo bold a defence, that the Tiger was at length obliged to give up.</p>
               <p>The hunting of the Stag has been held in all ages as a diverſion of the nobleſt kind; and former times bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the great exploits performed on theſe occaſions. In our iſland, large tracts of land were ſet apart for this purpoſe; villages and ſacred edifices were wantonly thrown down, and converted into one wide waſte, that the tyrant of the day might have room to purſue his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite diverſion. In the time of William Rufus and Henry the Firſt, it was leſs criminal to deſtroy one of the human ſpecies than a beaſt of chaſe. Happily for us, theſe wide-extended ſcenes of deſolation and oppreſſion have been gradually contracted; uſeful arts, agriculture, and commerce, have extenſively ſpread themſelves over the naked land; and theſe ſuperior beaſts of the chaſe have given way to other animals more uſeful to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
               <p>In the preſent cultivated ſtate of this country, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Stag is almoſt unknown in its wild ſtate: The few that remain are kept in parks among the Fallow-deer,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0209200900:117"/>
and diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Red Deer.</hi> Its viciouſneſs during the rutting ſeaſon, and the badneſs of its fleſh, which is poor and ill-flavoured, have occaſioned almoſt the extinction of the ſpecies. Some few are yet to be found in the foreſts that border on Cornwall and Devonſhire, on moſt of the large mountains of Ireland, and in the Highlands of Scotland, where Dr Johnſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them as not exceeding the Fallow-deer in ſize, and their fleſh of equal flavour. The Red Deer of this kingdom are nearly of the ſame ſize and colour, without much variety: In other parts of the world, they differ in form and ſize, as well as in their horns and the colour of their bodies.</p>

               <p>is an inhabitant of thoſe immenſe plains of India, water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the river Ganges.—M. Buffon conſiders it as a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety or ſhade between the Stag and the Fallow-deer. It is of the ſize of the latter; but its horns are round, like thoſe of the Stag; and it has no brow antlers. His whole body is marked with white ſpots, elegantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and diſtinct from each other; the belly, inſide of the thighs, and legs, are white; along the back there are two rows of ſpots, parallel to each other; thoſe on the other parts of the body are irregular; the head and neck are grey; and the tail, which is red above, and white beneath, is as long as that of the Fallow-deer.</p>
               <p>The continent of America abounds with Stags, and other animals of the Deer kind, in great variety. In ſome parts of that vaſt country, the inhabitants have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticated
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0209200900:119"/>
them, and live chiefly upon the milk and cheeſe with which they ſupply them.</p>
               <p>Thus we find, that the ſame animal which in ſome parts contributes only to the amuſement of man, may in others be brought to ſupply his neceſſities. The ſtores of Nature are various and abundant: It is induſtry alone that draws them out to ſupply our wants, and contribute to our comforts.</p>

               <head>
                  <figure/> THE FALLOW-DEER.</head>
               <p>The principal difference between the Stag and the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-deer ſeems to be in their ſize, and in the form of their horns,—the latter being much ſmaller than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and its horns, inſtead of being round like thoſe of the Stag, are broad and palmated, and better garniſhed with antlers; and when the horns are very ſtrong, they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0209200900:120"/>
are ſometimes terminated by ſmall palms: The tail is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo much longer than that of the Stag, and its hair is brighter: In other reſpects, they nearly reſemble each other.</p>
               <p>The horns of the Fallow-deer are ſhed annually, like thoſe of the Stag; but they fall off later, and are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nearly at the ſame time. Their rutting ſeaſon arrives fifteen days or three weeks after that of the Stag. The males then bellow frequently, but with a low and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted voice. They are not ſo furious at this ſeaſon as the Stag, nor exhauſt themſelves by any uncommon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. They never leave their paſture in queſt of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; but generally fight with each other, till one buck becomes maſter of the field.</p>
               <p>They aſſociate in herds, which ſometimes divide into two parties, and maintain obſtinate battles for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſome favourite part of the park: Each party has its leader, which is always the oldeſt and ſtrongeſt of the flock. In this manner they attack in regular order of battle; they fight with courage, and mutually ſupport each other; they retire, they rally, and ſeldom give up after one defeat. The combat is frequently renewed for ſeveral days together, till, after ſeveral defeats, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er party is obliged to give way, and leave the conquerors in poſſeſſion of the object of their contention.</p>
               <p>The Fallow-deer is eaſily tamed, feeds upon a variety of things which the Stag refuſes, and preſerves its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nearly the ſame through the whole year, although its fleſh is eſteemed much finer at particular ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>They are capable of procreation in their ſecond year; and, like the Stag, are fond of variety.—The female goes with young eight months; and produces one, ſometimes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0209200900:121"/>
two, and rarely three, at a time. They arrive at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at the age of three years, and live till about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>We have in England two varieties of the Fallow-deer, which are ſaid to be of foreign origin: The beautiful ſpotted kind, ſuppoſed to have been brought from Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; and the deep-brown ſort, now common in this country. Theſe laſt were introduced by king James the Firſt out of Norway; where having obſerved their hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in bearing the cold of that ſevere climate, he brought ſome of them into Scotland, and from thence tranſported them into his chaſes of Enfield and Epping. Since that time, they have multiplied exceedingly in many parts of this kingdom, which is now become famous for veniſon of ſuperior fatneſs and flavour to that of any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the world.</p>
               <p>The Fallow-deer, with ſome variation, is found in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every country of Europe. Thoſe of Spain are as large as Stags, but darker; their necks are alſo more ſlender; and their tails, which are longer than thoſe of ours, are black above, and white beneath.</p>
               <p>In Guiana, (a country of South-America) according to Labat, there are Deer without horns, ſmaller than thoſe of Europe, but reſembling them in every other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. They are very lively, light, and exceſſively ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid; of a reddiſh colour; with ſharp, piercing eyes, and ſhort tails. When purſued, they fly into places of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult acceſs. The natives frequently ſtand and watch for them in narrow paths, and as ſoon as the game ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears within reach, ſhoot them unperceived. Their fleſh is conſidered as a great delicacy; and the hunter is well rewarded for his trouble.</p>

                  <figure/> THE ROE-BUCK</head>
               <p>was formerly common in many parts of England and Wales; but at preſent is only to be found in the High-lands of Scotland.</p>
               <p>The Roe is the ſmalleſt of all the Deer kind, being only three feet four inches long, and ſomewhat more than two feet in height. The horns are from eight to nine inches long, upright, round, and divided into three branches; the body is covered with long hair; the lower part of each hair is aſh colour, near the end is a narrow bar of black, and the point is yellow; the hairs on the face are black, tipped with aſh colour; the ears are long, their inſides of a pale-yellow, and covered with long hair; the ſpaces bordering on the eyes and mouth are black; the cheſt, belly, legs, and the inſide of the thighs,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0209200900:123"/>
are of a yellowiſh-white; the rump is of a pure white; and the tail very ſhort.</p>
               <p>The form of the Roe-buck is elegant; and its motions light and eaſy. It bounds ſeemingly without effort, and runs with great ſwiftneſs. When hunted, it endeavours to elude its purſuers by the moſt ſubtle artifices: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly returns upon its former ſteps, till, by various windings, it has entirely confounded the ſcent. The cunning animal then, by a ſudden ſpring, bounds to one ſide, and lying cloſe down upon its belly, permits the hounds to paſs by without offering to ſtir.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals do not keep together in herds like other Deer, but live in ſeparate families: The fire, the dam, and the young ones, aſſociate together, and ſeldom mix with others.</p>
               <p>Their rutting ſeaſon continues but fifteen days—from the latter end of October till about the middle of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember. During this period, they will not ſuffer the fawns to remain with them: The Buck obliges them to retire, in order that the dam and her ſucceeding progeny may remain undiſturbed.—The female goes with young five months and a half, and brings forth about the end of April, or beginning of May. On theſe occaſions, ſhe ſeparates from the male, and conceals herſelf in the thickeſt and moſt retired part of the woods. She gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produces two fawns at a time, ſometimes three. In ten or twelve days, theſe are able to follow their dam. When threatened with danger, ſhe hides them in a thicket, and to preſerve them, offers herſelf to be chaſed. Notwithſtanding her care, ſhe is frequently robbed of her young: Numbers of fawns are found out and taken alive by the peaſants; and many more are worried by Dogs,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0209200900:124"/>
Foxes, and other carnivorous animals. By theſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual depredations, this beautiful creature is daily becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſcarce; and in many countries where once it was common, the race is now wholly extinct.</p>
               <p>When about eight or nine months old, their horns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to appear in the form of two knobs. The firſt year they are without antlers. They ſhed their horns the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of autumn, and renew them in the winter; in which they differ from the Stag, whoſe horns fall off in the ſpring, and are renewed in ſummer.—The life of the Roe-buck ſeldom exceeds twelve or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>They are very delicate in the choice of their food, and require a large tract of country, ſuited to the wildneſs of their nature, which can never be thoroughly ſubdued. No arts can teach them to be familiar with their keeper, nor in any degree attached to him. They are eaſily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; and in their attempts to eſcape, will run with ſuch force againſt the walls of their incloſure, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to diſable themſelves. They are likewiſe ſubject to capricious fits of fierceneſs, and on theſe occaſions will ſtrike furiouſly with their horns and feet at the object of their diſlike.</p>
               <p>Some years ago, one of theſe animals, after being hunted out of Scotland through Cumberland and various parts of the North of England, at laſt took refuge in the woody receſſes bordering upon the banks of the Tyne, between Prudhoe Caſtle and Wylam. It was frequently ſeen and hunted; but no dogs were equal to its ſpeed: It frequently croſſed the river; and either by ſwiftneſs or artifice, eluded all its purſuers. It happened, during the rigour of a ſevere winter, that being purſued, it croſſed the river upon the ice with ſome difficulty; and being
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0209200900:125"/>
much ſtrained by its violent exertions, was taken alive. It was kept for ſome weeks in the houſe; and being again turned out, all its cunning and activity were gone: It ſeemed to have forgotten the places of its former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; and after running ſome time, it lay down in the midſt of a brook, where it was killed by the dogs.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Roe-buck is fine and well taſted: That of the male, after the age of two years, is hard; the fleſh of the females, though farther advanced in years, is more tender: When very young, it is looſe and ſoft; but at the age of eighteen months, is in its higheſt ſtate of perfection.</p>
               <p>In America, this animal is much more common than in Europe.—In Louiſiana, it is very large. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants live chiefly upon its fleſh, which is good and well flavoured.</p>

                  <figure/> THE CAMEL</head>
               <p>POSSESSES the various qualities of the Horſe, the Cow, and the Sheep; and is to the Arabian, in a great meaſure, what thoſe uſeful creatures are to us. Its milk is rich and nouriſhing; and being mixed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, makes a wholeſome and refreſhing beverage, much uſed by the Arabs in their journies. The fleſh of young Camels is alſo an excellent and wholeſome food. Their hair or ſleece, which falls off entirely in the ſpring, is ſuperior to that of any other domeſtic animal, and is made into very fine ſtuffs for cloaths, coverings, tents, and other furniture.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſſed of his Camel, the Arabian has nothing either to want or to fear: In one day, he can perform a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of fifty leagues into the deſert, where he is ſafe from every enemy: For, without the aid of this uſeful animal, no perſon could purſue him amidſt ſandy deſerts, where there is neither verdure to refreſh, nor ſhade to ſhelter—
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0209200900:127"/>
where nothing preſents itſelf to the eye but one uniform void, naked and ſolitary.</p>
               <p>The Arabian regards the Camel as the moſt precious gift of Heaven; by the aſſiſtance of which he is enabled to ſubſiſt in thoſe frightful intervals of Nature, which ſerve him for an aſylum, and ſecure his independence. But it is not to the plundering Arab alone that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of this uſeful quadruped are confined,—in Turkey, Perſia, Barbary, and Egypt, every article of merchandiſe is carried by Camels. Merchants and travellers unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and form themſelves into numerous bodies, called caravans, to prevent the inſults of the Arabs. One of theſe caravans frequently conſiſts of many thouſands, the Camels being always more numerous than the men. Each Camel is loaded in proportion to his ſtrength. At the command of their conductor, they lie down on their belly, with their legs folded under them, and in this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture receive their burden: As ſoon as they are loaded, they riſe of their own accord, and will not ſuffer any greater weight to be impoſed upon them than they can bear with eaſe; when overloaded, they ſet up the moſt piteous cries till part of the burden be taken off. The large Camels generally carry a thouſand or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds weight; and the ſmalleſt, from ſix to ſeven hundred. As the route is often ſeven or eight hundred leagues, their motions and journies are regulated: They walk only, and in that pace travel ten or twelve leagues each day. Every night they are unloaded, and allowed to paſture upon ſuch herbage as they can find. Thiſtles, nettles, wormwood, and the other hard and prickly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables which the ſandy deſerts of Arabia produce, the Camel often prefers to more delicate herbage: But the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0209200900:128"/>
peculiar and diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of the Camel is, its faculty of abſtaining from water for a greater length of time than any other animal; for which Nature has made a wonderful proviſion, in giving it, beſides the four ſtomachs which it has in common with other ruminating animals, a fifth bag, ſerving as a reſervoir for water, where it remains without corrupting or mixing with the other aliments. When the animal is preſſed with thirſt, and has occaſion for water to macerate its food while ruminating, he makes part of it paſs into his ſtomach by a ſimple contraction of certain muſcles. By this ſingular ſtructure, the Camel can take a prodigious quantity of water at one draught; and is enabled to paſs ſeveral days without drinking: Leo Africanus ſays fifteen. They can diſcover water by their ſmell at half a league's diſtance; and after a long abſtinence, will haſten towards it, long before their drivers perceive where it lies. The feet of the Camel are peculiarly adapted to the ſandy ſoil on which he treads: On moiſt or ſlippery ground he cannot well ſupport himſelf, his hind legs being apt to ſpread out ſo wide, as to endanger his being diſabled.</p>
               <p>Many attempts have been made to introduce this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable animal into other countries; but as yet none have ſucceeded: The race ſeems to be confined to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtricts, where their utility has been known for ages.</p>
               <p>Though a native of warm climates, the Camel dreads thoſe which are exceſſively hot: It can neither ſubſiſt in the burning heat of the torrid zone, nor in the milder air of the temperate. It ſeems to be an original native of Arabia; for in that country, they are not only more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but thrive better than in any other part of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0209200900:129"/>There are two varieties of this animal, which have been diſtinguiſhed previous to all hiſtorical record: That which is called the <hi>Bactrian Camel,</hi> has two hunches on its back, and is found chiefly in Turkey and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Levant; while</p>

               <head>
                  <figure/> THE ARABIAN CAMEL, OR DROMEDARY,</head>
               <p>with only one hunch on its back, is common in Arabia and all the northern parts of Africa, from the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Sea to the river Niger, and is infinitely more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and more generally diffuſed than the Camel: It is alſo much ſwifter, and is therefore generally employed on buſineſs which requires diſpatch.</p>
               <p>In Arabia, they are trained for running matches; and in many places, for carrying couriers, who can go above a hundred miles a day on them, and that for nine or ten days together, over burning deſerts uninhabitable by any living creature. They require neither whip nor ſpur to quicken their pace: but go freely, if gently treated; and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0209200900:130"/>
are much enlivened by ſinging or the ſound of the pipe, which gives them freſh ſpirits to purſue their journey.</p>
               <p>They are mild and gentle creatures at all times, except when they are in heat: At that period, they are ſeized with a ſort of madneſs; they eat little, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attempt to bite their maſters; ſo that it is not ſafe to approach them.</p>
               <p>The Camel arrives at its full ſtrength at the age of ſix years, and lives forty or fifty.—The females are not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put to labour; but are allowed to paſture and breed at full liberty. Their time of geſtation is near twelve months; and they generally bring forth one at a birth.</p>

               <head>THE LAMA</head>
               <p>is the Camel of Peru and Chili; and before the conqueſt of thoſe countries by the Spaniards, was the only beaſt of burden known to the Indians.—Its diſpoſition is mild, gentle, and tractable.</p>
               <p>Before the introduction of Mules, theſe animals were uſed by the natives to plow the land, and now ſerve to carry burdens. They march ſlowly, and ſeldom accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh journies of more than four or five leagues a day; but what they want in ſpeed is made up by perſeverance and induſtry. They travel long journies in countries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable to moſt other animals. They are very ſure-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are much employed in tranſporting the rich ores dug out of the mines of Potoſi over the rugged hills and narrow paths of the Andes. Bolivar remarks, that in his time three hundred thouſand of theſe animals were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employed in this work. They lie down to be loaded; and when weary, no blows can excite them to quicken their pace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0209200900:131"/>They neither defend themſelves with their feet nor their teeth: When angry, they have no other method of revenging injuries but by ſpitting. They can throw out their ſaliva to the diſtance of ten paces; and if it fall on the ſkin, it raiſes an itching, accompanied with a ſlight inflammation.—Their fleſh is eaten, and ſaid to be as good as mutton.</p>
               <p>Like the Camel, they have the faculty of abſtaining long from water (ſometimes four or five days); and like that animal's, their food is coarſe and trifling. They are neither allowed corn nor hay; green herbage, of which they eat very moderately, being ſufficient for their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
               <p>The wild Lamas, called <hi>Guanacos,</hi> are ſtronger and more active than the domeſtic kind. They live in herds, and inhabit the higheſt regions of the Cordelieres. They run with great ſwiftneſs in places of difficult acceſs, where Dogs cannot eaſily follow them. The moſt uſual way of killing them is with the gun. They are hunted for the ſake of their fleſh and their hair: Of the latter the Indians make cloth.</p>
               <p>The Lamas vary in colour: Some of them are white, others black, and others of a mixed colour—white, grey, and ruſſet, diſperſed in ſpots. In ſhape, they reſemble the Camel, without the dorſal hunch. This animal has a well-ſhaped head, rather ſmall, and has ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to that of the Goat and Sheep; fine black eyes; and a long neck, bending much, and very protuberant near its junction with the body: Its ears are four inches long: Its feet are cloven like thoſe of the Ox; they are armed behind with a ſpur, by which the animal is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſupport itſelf on rugged and difficult ground.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0209200900:132"/>
The height of the Lama is about four feet; and its length, from the neck to the tail, ſix feet.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>THE PACOS</head>
               <p>very much reſembles the Lama in figure, but is much ſmaller. Its body is covered with very fine long wool, of the colour of dried roſes, or a dull purple; the belly is white. They live in vaſt herds, and inhabit the moſt elevated parts of the higheſt mountains, where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the utmoſt rigour of froſt and ſnow. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſwift; and ſo timid, that it is very difficult to come near them.</p>
               <p>The manner of taking them is ſingular: The Indians tie cords, with ſmall pieces of wool or cloth hanging from them, acroſs the narrow paſſes of the mountains, about three or four feet from the ground: They then drive a herd of theſe animals towards them; and they are ſo terrified by the flutter of the rags, that they dare not paſs; but huddle together, and ſuffer themſelves to be killed in great numbers.—Their wool is a valuable article of commerce; and is made into gloves, ſtockings, bed-cloaths, carpets, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Pacos are domeſticated; and like the Lamas, are employed in carrying burdens; but cannot bear more than from fifty to ſeventy-five pounds; and are ſtill more ſubject to capricious fits of obſtinacy. When once they lie down with their load, no blows can provoke them to riſe.</p>
               <p>The great advantages to be derived from the wool of theſe creatures, induced the Spaniards to attempt their introduction into Europe: Some of them were brought over to Spain; but by not ſufficiently attending to the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0209200900:133"/>

His ſnout is longer than that of the tame Hog; and his ears are ſhort, round, and black. He is armed with formidable tuſks in each jaw, which ſerve him for the double purpoſe of annoying his enemy, or procuring his food, which is chiefly roots and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: Some of their tuſks are almoſt a foot long: Thoſe in the upper jaw bend upwards in a circular form, and are exceedingly ſharp at the points; thoſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der jaw are always moſt to be dreaded; for with them the animal defends himſelf, and frequently gives mortal wounds.</p>
               <p>Wild Boars are not gregarious; but while young, live together in families, and frequently unite their forces
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0209200900:135"/>
againſt the wolves, or other beaſts of prey. When likely to be attacked, they call to each other with a very loud and fierce note: The ſtrongeſt face the danger, and form themſelves into a ring, the weakeſt falling into the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. In this poſition few beaſts dare venture to engage them; but leave them to purſue a leſs dangerous chaſe. —When the Wild Boar is arrived at a ſtate of maturity, he walks the foreſt alone and fearleſs. At that time he dreads no ſingle foe; nor will he turn out of his way even for man himſelf. He offends no animal; at the ſame time he is furniſhed with arms which render him a terror to the fierceſt.</p>
               <p>The hunting of the Wild Boar is a dangerous but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amuſement of the great in thoſe countries where it is to be found. The Dogs chiefly uſed for this ſport are of a ſlow and heavy kind. When the Boar is rouſed, he goes ſlowly forward, not much afraid, nor very far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his purſuers. He frequently turns round, ſtops till the hounds come up, and offers to attack them: After keeping each other at bay for a while, the Boar again goes ſlowly forward, and the Dogs renew the purſuit. In this manner the chaſe is continued till the Boar is quite tired, and refuſes to go any farther: The Dogs then attempt to cloſe in upon him from behind; and in this attack the young ones, being generally the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, frequently loſe their lives: The old ſeaſoned Dogs keep the animal at bay until the hunters come up, who kill him with their ſpears.</p>

               <p>is, of all other domeſtic quadrupeds, the moſt filthy and impure: Its form is clumſy and diſguſting, and its appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite gluttonous and exceſſive. In no inſtance has Nature more conſpicuouſly ſhewn her oeconomy than in this race of animals, whoſe ſtomachs are fitted to receive nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a variety of things that would be otherwiſe waſted: The refuſe of the field, the garden, the barn, and the kitchen, affords them a luxurious repaſt.</p>
               <p>Uſeleſs during life, and only valuable when deprived of it, this animal has ſometimes been compared to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, whoſe hoarded treaſures are of little value till death has deprived them of their rapacious owner.</p>
               <p>The parts of this animal are finely adapted to its mode of living: Nature has given it a form more prone than that of other animals: Its neck is ſtrong and brawny; its ſnout is long and callous, well calculated for the purpoſe of turning up the earth for roots of different kinds, on which it principally feeds (eſpecially in its wild ſtate); and it has a quick ſenſe of ſmelling, by which it is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0209200900:137"/>
to trace out its food. It is naturally ſtupid, inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and drowſy; much inclined to increaſe in fat, which is diſpoſed in a different manner from that of other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and forms a thick and regular coat between the fleſh and the ſkin. It is reſtleſs at a change of weather; and during certain high winds, is ſo agitated, as to run violently, ſcreaming horribly at the ſame time. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to foreſee the approach of bad weather, as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly carries ſtraw in its mouth to its ſty, prepares a bed, and ſeems endeavouring to hide itſelf from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ſtorm.</p>
               <p>Linnaeus obſerves that the fleſh of the Hog is a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food for thoſe that uſe much exerciſe, but bad for ſuch as lead a ſedentary life. It is of univerſal uſe, and makes in various ways a conſtant article in the elegancies of the table. It is of great importance to this country, as a commercial nation; for it takes ſalt better than any other kind, and conſequently is capable of being preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed longer: It is therefore of great uſe in ſhips, and makes a principal part of the proviſions of the Britiſh navy.</p>
               <p>The domeſtic Sow brings forth twice a year, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces from ten to twenty at a litter: She goes four months with young, and brings forth in the fifth. At that time ſhe muſt be carefully watched to prevent her from devouring her young: Still greater attention is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep off the male, as he would deſtroy the whole litter.</p>
               <p>The moſt numerous breed of Hogs in this iſland is that generally known by the name of the <hi>Berkſhire Pigs,</hi> now ſpread through almoſt every part of England, and ſome parts of Scotland. They are in general of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh-brown colour, with black ſpots upon them; have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0209200900:138"/>
large ears hanging over their eyes; are ſhort-legged, ſmall-boned, and are readily made fat. Some of theſe have been fed to an almoſt incredible ſize. Mr Culley, in his treatiſe on live ſtock, gives an account of one that was killed at Congleton in Cheſhire, which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, from the noſe to the end of the tail, three yards eight inches; in height, it was four feet and a half; and weighed, after it was killed, eighty-ſix ſtones eleven pounds, avoirdupoiſe.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe or black breed are now very common in England. They are ſmaller, have ſhorter legs, and their fleſh is whiter and ſweeter than the common kind.</p>
               <p>The Hog ſpecies, though very numerous, and diffuſed over Europe, Aſia, and Africa, did not exiſt in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, till tranſported thither by the Spaniards. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places they have multiplied exceedingly, and become wild. They reſemble the domeſtic Hog; but their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſhorter, and their ſnout and ſkin thicker.</p>

                  <figure/> THE AFRICAN WILD BOAR, OR WOOD SWINE,</head>
               <p>lives in a wild, uncultivated ſtate, in the hotteſt parts of Africa. It is a very vicious animal, and quick in all its motions. It is as dangerous to attack one of them, as a Lion: For, though much ſmaller, it ruſhes upon a man as ſwift as an arrow; and throwing him down before he has time to ſtrike with his javelin, breaks his legs, and at the ſame inſtant rips up his belly.</p>
               <p>It has four tuſks: Two very large ones proceed from the upper jaw, and turn upwards like a horn,—in length nine inches, and full five inches round at the baſe; the two other tuſks, which come from the lower jaw, project but three inches from the mouth. Theſe tuſks the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal makes uſe of as the dreadful inſtruments of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. He will attack a man on horſeback, if he ſhould venture to come too near him; and firſt breaking the Horſe's legs, kills both him and his rider.</p>
               <p>Sparrman deſcribes it as being of a bright yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, like the domeſtic kind. Its noſe is broad, flat, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0209200900:140"/>
of a horny hardneſs; its head is very large in proportion to the ſize of its body; underneath each eye it has a great lobe or wattle, lying almoſt horizontally, broad, flat, rounded at the end, and placed ſo as to intercept the view of any thing immediately beneath the animal; the ears are large and ſharp-pointed, lined on the inſide with long whitiſh hairs; its tail is ſlender and flat; when the animal is purſued, it always holds it quite erect.</p>
               <p>They live in holes under ground, the avenues to which are exceedingly narrow. The natives ſeldom dare attack them in their retreats, as there is always danger of their ruſhing out unawares. When purſued with their young ones, it is no uncommon thing to ſee them take them up in their mouths, and run with them in that manner at a great rate.</p>
               <p>From the ſhortneſs of their necks, they frequently fall on their knees to feed; and change this poſture to that of ſtanding with the greateſt eaſe.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of this animal is good, and very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of the common Hog.</p>

                  <figure/> THE PECCARY, OR MEXICAN HOG,</head>
               <p>inhabits the hotteſt parts of South-America, where the ſpecies is very numerous: Herds, conſiſting of two or three hundred, are ſometimes to be ſeen together.—It is a very fierce animal; and will fight ſtoutly with beaſts of prey, when attacked by them. The Jaguar, or Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Leopard, is its mortal enemy; and frequently loſes its life in engaging a number of theſe animals. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt each other, ſurround their enemies, and often come off victorious.</p>
               <p>They live chiefly in mountainous places; and are not fond of wallowing in the mire, like the common Hog. They feed on fruits, roots, and feeds: They likewiſe eat ſerpents, toads, and lizards; and are very dexterous in firſt taking off the ſkins with their fore feet and teeth.</p>
               <p>The Peccary in appearance reſembles the Hog, though ſomewhat ſmaller; its body is covered with ſtrong briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which, when the creature is irritated, riſe up like the prickles of a Hedgehog, and are nearly as ſtrong; they are of a duſky colour, with alternate rings of white;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0209200900:142"/>
acroſs the ſhoulders to the breaſt, there is a band of white; its head is ſhort and thick; it has two tuſks in each jaw; its ears are ſmall and erect; and inſtead of a tail, it has a ſmall fleſhy protuberance, which does not cover its poſteriors. It differs moſt eſſentially from the Hog, as well as every other animal, in having a ſmall orifice on the lower part of the back, from whence a thin watery humour, of a moſt diſagreeable ſmell, flows very copiouſly. In the Philoſophical Tranſactions, Dr Tyſon has deſcribed this orifice very minutely, as well as ſome other peculiarities in the conformation of its ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and inteſtines.</p>
               <p>This animal, like the Hog, is very prolific. The young ones follow the mother till they are able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves. If taken at firſt, they are eaſily tamed, and ſoon loſe all their natural ferocity; but can never be brought to diſcover any ſigns of attachment to thoſe that feed them. They do no miſchief, and may be allowed to run about at pleaſure. They ſeldom ſtray far from home, but return of their own accord.—When an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, they grunt like the Hog, but much ſtronger and harſher; and when ſuddenly alarmed, make a ſharp noiſe with their breath, and erect their briſtles.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Peccary, though drier and leaner than that of our Hog, is by no means diſagreeable, and may be greatly improved by caſtration. When killed, the dorſel gland muſt be immediately cut off: If this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be deferred for the ſpace of half an hour, the fleſh becomes utterly unfit to be eaten.</p>
               <p>Although the European Hog is common in America, and in many parts has become wild, the Peccary has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been known to breed with it: They frequently go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0209200900:143"/>
and feed in the ſame woods; but hitherto no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate breed has been known to ariſe from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe.</p>
               <p>M. de la Borde deſcribes two kinds of this animal,— one ſmaller than the other. He relates, that being one day engaged with ſome others in hunting a drove of Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, they were ſurrounded by them, and obliged to take refuge upon a piece of rock; and, notwithſtanding they kept up a conſtant fire among them, the creatures did not retire till a great number of them were ſlain.</p>

               <p>though claſſed by naturaliſts with the Hog kind, differs from animals of that ſpecies in a variety of particulars: Its legs are longer, and its body more ſlender; it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſhort hair as ſoft as wool, and of a dark-grey colour mixed with red; its ears are ſhort and pointed; its tail is long, tufted at the end, and often twiſted. Its moſt diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic conſiſts in four large tuſks, the two ſtouteſt of which proceed, like thoſe of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0209200900:144"/>
Wild Boar, from the under jaw, pointing upwards, and ſtanding near eight inches out of the ſockets; the two others riſe up like horns on the outſide of the upper jaw, juſt above the noſe, and extend in a curve above the eyes, almoſt touching the forehead, and are twelve inches in length. Theſe tuſks are of the moſt beautiful ivory, but not ſo hard as thoſe of the Elephant.</p>
               <p>This animal abounds in ſeveral of the iſlands of the Eaſt-Indies; particularly Buero, a ſmall iſle near Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna.</p>
               <p>Though formidable in appearance, it is eaſily tamed; and its fleſh is well taſted. It lives on leaves of trees and other vegetables. Its ſcent is exquiſite; it can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the approach of Dogs at a diſtance. When cloſely purſued, it plunges into the ſea, ſwims and dives with great facility from one iſland to another, and by that means frequently eſcapes from its purſuers.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals live in herds; and when any number of them are together, their odour is ſo ſtrong, that the Dogs can ſcent them at a conſiderable diſtance. When attacked, they growl frightfully, and defend themſelves with their under tuſks; the upper ones are only ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them in taking their repoſe, which they do like the elephant, by hooking them on the branches of trees.</p>

               <p>is the <hi>Hippopotamus</hi> of the new world, and has by ſome authors been miſtaken for that animal. It inhabits the woods and rivers on the eaſtern ſide of South-America, from the iſthmus of Darien to the river of the Amazons. It is a melancholy animal, ſleeps during the day, and goes out in the night in ſearch of food; lives on graſs, ſugar-canes, and fruits. If diſturbed, it takes to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſwims with great eaſe, or plunges to the bottom; and like the Hippopotamus, walks there as on dry ground.</p>
               <p>It is about the ſize of a ſmall Cow; its noſe is long and ſlender, and extends far beyond the lower jaw, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of proboſcis, which it can contract or extend at pleaſure; each jaw is furniſhed with ten cutting teeth, and as many grinders; its ears are ſmall and erect; its body formed like that of a Hog; its back arched; legs ſhort; and hoofs, of which it has four upon each foot, ſmall, black, and hollow; its tail is very ſmall; its hair ſhort, and of a duſky-brown colour.</p>

It lives on the banks of great rivers, ſwims and dives remarkably well, is very dexterous in catching fiſh, upon which it chiefly ſubſiſts: It likewiſe eats grain, fruits, and ſugar-canes; feeds moſtly in the night, and commits great ravages in the gardens. They generally keep in large herds, and make a horrible noiſe, not much unlike the braying of an Aſs. Its fleſh is fat and tender; but, like that of the Otter, has an oily and fiſhy taſte.</p>
               <p>This animal, which is alſo called the <hi>Capibara,</hi> is about the ſize of a ſmall Hog, and by ſome naturaliſts has been claſſed with that animal. We have already ſeen, that in diſpoſition and manners it is widely different; in other
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0209200900:147"/>
reſpects, its affinity to the Hog kind ſeems to be ſlight, and the characteriſtic differences many. The fore hoofs are divided into four, and the hind ones into three; its head is large and thick; and on the noſe there are long whiſkers; its ears are ſmall and rounded; and its eyes large and black; there are two large cutting teeth, and eight grinders in each jaw; and each of theſe grinders forms on its ſurface what appears to be three teeth, flat at their ends; the legs are ſhort; the toes long, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected at the bottom with a ſmall web; the end of each toe is guarded by a ſmall hoof; it has no tail; the hair on the body is ſhort, rough, and of a brown colour.</p>
               <p>This animal is gentle and peaceable, eaſily tamed, and will follow thoſe who feed it and treat it kindly.—As it runs badly, on account of the peculiar conſtruction of its feet, its ſafety conſiſts not in flight; Nature has provided it with other means of preſervation: When in danger, it plunges into the water, dives to a great diſtance, and by that means evades its purſuers.</p>

                  <figure/> THE RHINOCEROS.</head>
               <p>We are indebted to the labours of many learned and ingenious naturaliſts for accurate deſcriptions of this wonderful creature, which in ſize is only exceeded by the Elephant, and in ſtrength and power is inferior to no other animal. Bontius ſays, that in the bulk of its body it equals the Elephant, but is lower only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſhortneſs of its legs.</p>
               <p>The length of this animal, from the extremity of the muzzle to the inſertion of the tail, is uſually twelve feet; and the circumference of its body nearly equal to its length: Its noſe is armed with a formidable weapon, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to this creature, being a very hard and ſolid horn, with which it defends itſelf from every adverſary. The Tiger will rather attack the Elephant, whoſe trunk it can lay hold of, than the Rhinoceros, which it cannot face, without danger of having its bowels torn out. The body and limbs of the Rhinoceros are covered with a ſkin ſo hard and impenetrable, that he fears neither the claws of the Tiger, nor the more formidable proboſcis of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0209200900:149"/>
Elephant; it will turn the edge of a ſcimitar, and even reſiſt the force of a muſket-ball. The ſkin, which is of a blackiſh colour, forms itſelf into large folds at the neck, the ſhoulders, and the crupper, by which the motion of the head and limbs is facilitated; round the neck, which is very ſhort, are two large folds; there is a fold from the ſhoulders, which hangs down upon the fore legs; and another from the hind part of the back to the thighs. The body is every-where covered with ſmall tuberoſities or knots, which are ſmall on the neck and back, but larger on the ſides: The thighs, legs, and even the feet, are full of theſe incruſtations, which have been miſtaken for ſcales by ſome authors: They are, however, only ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indurations of the ſkin, without any uniformity in their figure, or regularity in their poſitions. Between the folds, the ſkin is penetrable and delicate, as ſoft to the touch as ſilk, and of a light-fleſh colour; the ſkin of the belly is nearly of the ſame colour and conſiſtency. The body of the Rhinoceros is long and thick; its belly is large, and hangs near the ground; its legs ſhort, round, and very ſtrong; and its hoofs are divided into three parts, each pointing forward. The head of this animal is large; its ears long and erect; and its eyes ſmall, ſunk, and without vivacity; the upper lip is long, overhangs the lower, and is capable of great extenſion: It is ſo pliable, that the Rhinoceros can move it from ſide to ſide, twiſt it round a ſtick, collect its food, or ſeize with it any thing it would carry to its mouth.</p>
               <p>The Rhinoceros, without being ferocious, carnivorous, or even extremely wild, is, however, totally untractable and rude. It ſeems to be ſubject to paroxyſms of fury, which nothing can appeaſe. That which Emanuel, king
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0209200900:150"/>
of Portugal, ſent to the pope in the year 1513, deſtroyed the veſſel in which they were tranſporting it.</p>
               <p>Like the Hog, this animal is fond of wallowing in the mire. It is a ſolitary animal, loves moiſt and marſhy grounds, and ſeldom quits the banks of rivers.—It is found in Bengal, Siam, China, and other countries of Aſia; in the iſles of Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, &amp;c.; in Ethiopia, and the country as low as the Cape of Good Hope: But in general, the ſpecies is not numerous, and is much leſs diffuſed than that of the Elephant.</p>
               <p>The female produces but one at a time, and at conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable intervals. During the firſt month, the young Rhinoceros exceeds not the ſize of a large Dog. At the age of two years, the horn is not more than an inch long; at ſix years old, it is nine or ten inches long; and grows to the length of three feet and a half, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four feet. The horn is much eſteemed by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as an antidote againſt poiſon, as well as a remedy for particular diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The Rhinoceros feeds on the groſſeſt herbs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers thiſtles and ſhrubs to ſoft or delicate paſturage. It is fond of the ſugar-cane, and eats all kinds of grain.</p>
               <p>Dr Parſons remarks, that this animal has an acute and very attentive ear: It will liſten with a deep and long-continued attention to any kind of noiſe; and, though it be eating, lying down, or obeying any preſſing demands of Nature, it will raiſe its head, and liſten till the noiſe ceaſe.</p>
               <p>From the peculiar conſtruction of his eyes, the Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros can only ſee what is immediately before him. When he purſues any object, he proceeds always in a direct line, overturning every obſtruction. With the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0209200900:151"/>
horn on his noſe, he tears up trees, raiſes ſtones, and throws them behind him to a conſiderable diſtance.—His ſenſe of ſmelling is ſo exquiſite, that the hunters are obliged to avoid being to windward of him. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him at a diſtance, and watch till he lies down to ſleep: They then approach with great precaution, and diſcharge their muſkets all at once into the lower part of the belly.</p>
               <p>The Rhinoceros is ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Unicorn</hi> of holy writ, and poſſeſſes all the properties aſcribed to that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, —rage, untameableneſs, great ſwiftneſs, and immenſe ſtrength.—It was known to the Romans in very early times, and is handed down to us in ſome of the works of that celebrated people. Auguſtus introduced one into the ſhows, on his triumph over Cleopatra.</p>
               <p>Its fleſh is eaten, and is much reliſhed by the natives of India and Africa.</p>

                  <figure/> THE TWO-HORNED RHINOCEROS.</head>
               <p>We have given the figure of this animal from Mr Sparrman, whoſe authenticity there is every reaſon to depend upon, and who has given a moſt exact anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal deſcription of this hitherto undeſcribed animal. Of two that were ſhot, he only mentions the ſize of the ſmaller of them, which was eleven feet and a half long, ſeven feet high, and twelve in circumference. It was without any folds on the ſkin, which was of an aſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; excepting about the groin, where it was of a fleſh-colour. The ſurface of the ſkin was ſcabrous and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of a cloſe texture, and when dry extremely hard. There were no hairs on any part of the body, except the edges of the ears and the tip of the tail, which were furniſhed with a few dark briſtly hairs, about an inch long.</p>
               <p>The horns of this animal are placed one behind the other, in a line with the noſe: The foremoſt of them meaſures about eighteen inches in length, and is always
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0209200900:153"/>
the larger of the two. It is remarkable, that the Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros makes uſe of the ſhorter horn only for the purpoſe of digging up roots, which compoſe great part of its food; it being endued with the power of turning the larger horn on one ſide out of the way. The ſhape of the horns is conical, with the tips inclining a little back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; the texture of the lower part is rough, and ſeems as if it conſiſted of horny fibres; the upper part is ſmooth and plain, like thoſe of an Ox. The feet are round, and do not ſpread much: They have three hoofs on each of them, which project but little; the middle one is the longeſt. The eyes of the Rhinoceros are ſmall, and ſunk into its head; in conſequence of which it ſees indiſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But its organs of hearing and ſmelling are very acute. At the leaſt noiſe, the creature takes the alarm, pricks up its ears, and liſtens with great attention: If it happen to catch the ſcent of any perſon within a ſmall diſtance, it ruſhes out with aſtoniſhing quickneſs; and it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to avoid the impetuous attack of this powerful ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
               <p>It has been generally ſaid of the Rhinoceros, that its tongue is ſo hard and rough as to take away the ſkin and fleſh wherever it licks any perſon that has unfortunately fallen a victim to its fury: Mr Sparrman ſays, however, that he thruſt his hand into the mouth of one that had juſt been ſhot, and found the tongue perfectly ſoft and ſmooth.—From the account of its inteſtines, given us by the ſame ingenious author, we ſhall juſt mention the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which will enable our readers to form a more perfect idea of its enormous bulk:—The ſtomach was four feet in length, and two in diameter; to which was annexed a tube or canal, twenty-eight feet long, and ſix
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0209200900:154"/>
inches diameter; the kidnies were a foot and a half in breadth; the heart was a foot and a half long, and nearly the ſame in breadth; the liver, when meaſured from right to left, was found to be three feet and a half in breadth, and two feet and a half deep, as it hangs in the animal's body when it is in a ſtanding poſition; it had no gall-bladder, in which it reſembles the Horſe. Upon opening the ſtomach, the contents of it were found to conſiſt of roots and ſmall branches of trees maſticated, ſome of which were as big as the end of a man's finger; in the maſs there appeared a great quantity of ſucculent plants, as well as ſome that were harſh and prickly: The effluvium ariſing from this maſs was ſo far from being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, that it diffuſed around a very ſtrong and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable aromatic odour. We ſhall conclude our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this animal by obſerving, that the cavity which contained the brains was ſmall, being barely ſix inches long, and four high, and of an oval ſhape: Being filled with peaſe, it was found to contain barely one quart; a human ſkull, meaſured at the ſame time, did not require much leſs than three pints to fill it.</p>

been much retarded, the laborious reſearches of many learned and ingenious naturaliſts greatly fruſtrated, and the errors of former times repeatedly copied and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied without number.</p>
               <p>The ſize of the Hippopotamus is nearly equal to that of the Elephant. It inhabits all the larger rivers of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, from the Niger to the Cape of Good Hope; but is found in none of the African rivers that run into the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean, except the Nile, and in that part of it only which is in the Upper Egypt, and in the fens and lakes of Ethiopia, through which that river paſſes.</p>
               <p>The head of this animal is enormouſly large; its mouth vaſtly wide. Ray ſays, that the upper mandible is move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, like that of a Crocodile: In each jaw there are four cutting teeth; thoſe in the lower jaw point ſtraight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: It has four large tuſks; the largeſt, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the lower jaw, are ſometimes above two feet long: It is ſaid that the canine teeth are ſo hard, as to emit fire on being ſtruck with ſteel; they are perfectly white, and preferable to ivory for making artificial teeth: The grinders are ſquare or oblong, like thoſe of a man; and ſo large, that a ſingle tooth weighs above three pounds: The ſkin is of a duſky colour, bears a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to that of the Rhinoceros, but is thicker, and is made into whips: The tail is near a foot long, taper, and flatted at the end, which is thinly furniſhed with hairs like briſtles: Its legs are ſo ſhort, that its belly almoſt touches the ground: The hoofs are divided into four parts, unconnected by membranes, although it is an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibious animal. When alarmed or purſued, it takes to the water, plunges in, and ſinks to the bottom; where it walks at full eaſe: It often riſes to the ſurface, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0209200900:157"/>
with its head out of the water, making a bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noiſe, which may be heard at a great diſtance. It feeds during night on the banks of the rivers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does great damage in the adjacent plantations of rice and other grain. It is ſaid likewiſe, that it feeds upon fiſh; but Dr Sparrman, in his account of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, denies that it ſeeks any other food than herbs and graſs.</p>
               <p>The Hippopotamus is naturally a mild and gentle ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, very ſlow and heavy in its movements upon land, but in the water bold and active; and when provoked or wounded, will riſe, and attack boats or canoes with great fury. Dampier ſays, he has known one of theſe animals ſink a boat full of people, by biting a hole in the bottom with his great tuſks.—The method of taking them is by digging pits in the ſand, in thoſe parts through which the animal paſſes in his way to the river after he has been feeding.</p>
               <p>Sparrman ſays, that the fleſh of the Hippopotamus is tender and good, that the fat is fine and well taſted, and much in requeſt with the coloniſts at the Cape, who look upon it as the moſt wholeſome meat that can be eaten. The gelatinous part of the feet in particular is accounted a great delicacy. The dried tongue of this animal is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conſidered at the Cape as a rare and excellent diſh.— That author has given an engraving of this animal, taken from a young one which he caught at the Cape, from which ours is copied.—The female brings forth one young at a time.</p>
               <p>Scaurus treated the Romans with one of theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and five crocodiles, during his aedileſhip, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited them on a temporary lake. Auguſtus produced one in the celebration of his triumph over Cleopatra.</p>

                  <figure/> THE ELEPHANT.</head>
               <p>Of all the creatures that have hitherto been taken into the ſervice of man, the Elephant is pre-eminent in the ſize and ſtrength of his body, and inferior to none in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity and obedience. From time immemorial this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal has been employed either for the purpoſes of labour, of war, or of oſtentatious parade; to increaſe the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of eaſtern princes, extend their power, or enlarge their dominions.</p>
               <p>The Elephant is a native of Aſia and Africa, and is not to be found in its natural ſtate either in Europe or America. From the river Senegal to the Cape of Good Hope, they are met with in great numbers: In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive region, as they are more numerous than in any other part of the world, ſo are they leſs fearful of man. The ſavage inhabitants of this dreary country, inſtead of attempting to ſubdue this powerful animal, and render it
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0209200900:159"/>
ſubſervient to their neceſſities, ſeem deſirous only of avoiding its fury.</p>
               <p>Sparrman ſays, that in the country near the Cape they are ſometimes ſeen in large herds, conſiſting of many hundreds; and thinks it probable, that in the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and unfrequented parts of that vaſt country, they are ſtill more numerous.</p>
               <p>They are frequently hunted by the coloniſts at the Cape, who are very expert in ſhooting them, and make great advantage of their teeth. The largeſt teeth weigh a hundred and fifty Dutch pounds, and are ſold to the governor for as many guilders; ſo that a man may earn three hundred guilders at one ſhot. It is not therefore to be wondered, that a traffic ſo lucrative ſhould tempt the hunters to run great riſks. In approaching this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, great care muſt be taken to ſteal upon him unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: If the Elephant diſcovers his enemy near him, he ruſhes out, and endeavours to kill him. One of theſe hunters being out upon a plain, under the ſhelter of a few ſcattered thorn trees, thought he ſhould be able to advance near enough to ſhoot an Elephant that was at a little diſtance from him: He was diſcovered, purſued, and overtaken by the animal, which laid hold of him with his trunk, and beat him inſtantly to death.</p>
               <p>The height of the Elephant at the Cape is from twelve to fifteen feet. The female is leſs than the male, and her tuſks do not grow to ſuch a ſize.—The ears are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly large, and marked on the edges with deep inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: They are pendulous, except when the animal is irritated; at which time he draws them up almoſt in the form of a purſe, and points them forward. The ear of an Elephant ſhot at the Cape, was ſaid to reach from the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0209200900:160"/>
ſhoulders of a middle-ſized Hottentot to the ground.— There are four grinders in each jaw, cloſely united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forming, with the jaw-bone, one hard and compact body. One of theſe grinders ſometimes meaſures nine inches broad, and weighs four pounds and a half.—The texture of the ſkin is uneven, wrinkled, and knotty; full of deep fiſſures, nearly reſembling the bark of an old oak tree, which run in all directions over the ſurface of it: It is of a tawny colour, inclining to citron. In the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures there are ſome briſtly hairs, which are alſo thinly ſcattered over the body.—The legs of this creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble maſſy columns, of fifteen or eighteen inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, and from five to ſix feet high.—The foot is ſhort, and divided into five toes, covered with the ſkin, ſo as not to be viſible. To each toe there is affixed a nail or hoof, of a horny ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>The moſt remarkable feature of the Elephant is his trunk or proboſcis, which is compoſed of membranes, nerves, and muſcles. It is both an organ of feeling and of motion. The animal cannot only move and bend it, but can contract, lengthen, and turn it in every direction. The extremity of the trunk terminates in a protuberance, which ſtretches out on the upper ſide in the form of a finger, and poſſeſſes in a great degree the niceneſs and dexterity of that uſeful member. It is equally flexible, and as capable of laying hold of objects as the fingers of a man. He lifts from the ground the ſmalleſt piece of money; he ſelects herbs and flowers, and picks them up one by one; he unties the knots of ropes, opens and ſhuts gates, &amp;c. With his trunk he graſps any body which it is applied to, ſo firmly, that no force can tear it from his gripe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0209200900:161"/>Of all the inſtruments which Nature has ſo liberally beſtowed on her moſt favourite productions, the trunk of the Elephant is perhaps the moſt complete and the moſt admirable. Ray ſays, it is divided into three partitions or chambers, two of which run in ſpiral directions, and the other in a right line. It is eight feet long in an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant of fourteen feet high, and five feet in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at the thickeſt part. The noſtrils are ſituated at the extremity, through which it draws in water by a ſtrong ſuction, either for the purpoſe of quenching its thirſt, or of waſhing and cooling itſelf, which it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does, by taking up a large quantity, part of which it carries to its mouth, and drinks; and by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the trunk, allows the remainder to run over every part of its body.</p>
               <p>Roots, herbs, leaves, and tender wood, are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary food of the Elephant: It likewiſe eats grains and fruit, but will not eat fleſh nor fiſh. When one of them diſcovers a plentiful paſture, he calls to the others, and invites them to eat with him. As they require a great quantity of forage, they frequently change their paſture, and do incredible damage whenever they happen to ſtray on cultivated ground. From the weight of their bodies and the ſize of their feet, they deſtroy much more than they uſe for food. One of them will eat one hundred and fifty pounds of graſs in a day; ſo that a troop of theſe animals lays a whole country waſte in a ſhort time. The Indians and negroes uſe every artifice to prevent the approach of theſe unwelcome viſitants, making loud noiſes, and kindling fires round their habitations; but in ſpite of all their precautions, the Elephants often break through their fences, deſtroy their whole harveſt, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0209200900:162"/>
overturn their huts. It is not eaſy to ſeparate them: They generally act in concert, whether they attack, march, or fly.</p>
               <p>The ordinary walk of the Elephant is not quicker than that of a Horſe; but when puſhed, he aſſumes a kind of ambling pace, which in fleetneſs is equal to a gallop. He goes forward with eaſe and celerity; but it is with great difficulty that he turns himſelf round, and that not without taking a pretty large circuit. It is generally in narrow and hollow places that the negroes attack him, and cut off his tail, which they value above every other part of his body.—He ſwims well, and is of great uſe in carrying great quantities of baggage over large rivers. When ſwimming, he raiſes his long trunk above the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water for the ſake of reſpiration, every other part of his body being below: In this manner ſeveral of theſe animals ſwim together, and ſteer their courſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of running foul of each other.</p>
               <p>The Elephant, when tamed, is gentle, obedient, and docile: Patient of labour, it ſubmits to the moſt toilſome drudgery; and ſo attentive to the commands of its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, that a word or a look is ſufficient to ſtimulate it to the moſt violent exertions. Its attachment to its keeper is ſo great, that it careſſes him with its trunk, and frequently will obey no other maſter: It knows his voice, and can diſtinguiſh the tone of command, of anger, or of approbation, and regulates its actions accordingly: It receives his orders with attention, and executes them with eagerneſs, but without precipitation. All its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are orderly, and ſeem to correſpond with the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its appearance, being grave, majeſtic, and cautious. It kneels down for the accommodation of thoſe who
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0209200900:163"/>
would mount upon its back, and with its pliant trunk even aſſiſts them to aſcend. It ſuffers itſelf to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and ſeems to have a pleaſure in the finery of its trappings. It is uſed in drawing chariots, waggons, and various kinds of machines. One of theſe animals will perform with eaſe the work of many Horſes.</p>
               <p>The conductor of the Elephant is uſually mounted on its neck; and makes uſe of a rod of iron, ſharp at the end, and hooked, with which he urges the animal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by pricking its head, ears, or muzzle; but in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a word from the keeper is ſufficient to encourage this intelligent creature to proceed on its way, or perform the taſk aſſigned to it.—In India, where they were once employed in launching ſhips, one of them was directed to force a large veſſel into the water; which proving ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to its ſtrength, the maſter, in an angry tone, cried out, 'Take away that lazy beaſt, and bring another in its place.' The poor animal inſtantly redoubled its efforts, fractured its ſkull, and died upon the ſpot.</p>
               <p>The Indians, from very early periods, have employed Elephants in their wars: Porus oppoſed the paſſage of Alexander over the Hydaſpes with eighty-five of theſe animals. M. de Buffon imagines that it was ſome of the Elephants taken by that monarch, and afterwards tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported into Greece, which were employed by Pyrrhus againſt the Romans.—Since the invention of fire-arms, the Elephant has been of little uſe in deciding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts of hoſtile nations; for, being terrified with the flaſh of the powder and the report that immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, they are ſoon thrown into confuſion, and then become dangerous to their employers.—They are now chiefly uſed for the purpoſes of labour or magnificent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0209200900:164"/>
The Indian princes, in their travels, are attended by hundreds of theſe animals: Some are employed to convey the ladies which compoſe the ſeraglio, in latticed cages made for that purpoſe, and covered with branches of trees; whilſt others tranſport immenſe quantities of baggage, with which the ſovereigns of the Eaſt are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied in their marches from one place to another. They are likewiſe made uſe of as the dreadful inſtruments of executing condemned criminals—a taſk which they perform with great dexterity. At the word of command, they break the limbs of the criminal with their trunks; they ſometimes trample him to death, or impale him on their enormous tuſks, juſt as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by their more barbarous keeper.</p>
               <p>It is a ſingular circumſtance in the hiſtory of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary animal, that, in a ſtate of ſubjection, it is unalterably barren; and, though it has been reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of man for ages, it has never been known to breed,—as if it had a proper ſenſe of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded condition, and obſtinately refuſed to increaſe the pride and power of its conqueror by propagating a race of ſlaves. It therefore follows, that of all the numerous bands of theſe creatures that are trained to ſervice, there is not one that has not been originally wild, nor one that has not been forced into a ſtate of ſubjection. To recruit, therefore, the numbers that are unavoidably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by diſeaſe, accident, or age, the eaſtern princes are obliged every year to ſend into the foreſts, and to uſe various methods to procure freſh ſupplies.</p>
               <p>The manner of taking, taming, and rendering theſe animals ſubmiſſive, is curious, and well deſerves a place in the hiſtory of the Elephant:—In the midſt of a foreſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0209200900:165"/>
abounding with Elephants, a large piece of ground is marked out, and ſurrounded with ſtrong paliſades, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with branches of trees: One end of the incloſure is narrow; from which it widens gradually, ſo as to take in a great extent of country. Several thouſand men are employed upon the occaſion, who place themſelves in ſuch a manner as to prevent the wild Elephants from making their eſcape: They kindle large fires at certain diſtances, and make a dreadful noiſe with drums and various kinds of diſcordant inſtruments, calculated for the purpoſe of ſtunning and terrifying the poor animals; whilſt another party, conſiſting of ſome thouſands, with the aſſiſtance of tame female Elephants, trained for the purpoſe, drive the wild Elephants ſlowly towards the great opening of the incloſure, the whole train of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cloſing in after them, ſhouting, and making a great noiſe, till the Elephants are driven by inſenſible degrees into the narrow part of the incloſure, through which there is an opening into a ſmaller ſpace, ſtrongly fenced in, and guarded on all ſides. As ſoon as one of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants enters this ſtrait, a ſtrong bar cloſes the paſſage from behind, and he finds himſelf completely environed. On the top of this narrow paſſage ſome of the huntſmen ſtand with goads in their hands, urging the creature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the end of the paſſage, where there is an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſt wide enough to let him paſs. He is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the cuſtody of two female Elephants, who ſtand on each ſide of him, and preſs him into the ſervice: If he is likely to prove refractory, they begin to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline him with their trunks, till he is reduced to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſuffers himſelf to be led to a tree, where he is bound by the leg with ſtout thongs, made of untanned
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0209200900:166"/>
elk or buck ſkin. The tame Elephants are then led back to the incloſure; and the others are made to ſubmit in the ſame manner. They are all ſuffered to remain faſt to the trees for ſeveral days. Attendants are placed by the ſide of each animal, who ſupply him with food by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, till he is brought by degrees to be ſenſible of kindneſs and careſſes, and allows himſelf to be led to the ſtable. In the ſpace of fourteen days, his abſolute ſubmiſſion is completed. During that time he is fed dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with cocoa-nut leaves, and led once a day to the water by the tame ones. He becomes accuſtomed to the voice of his keeper, and at laſt quietly reſigns his prodigious powers to the dominion and ſervice of man.</p>
               <p>The time of geſtation in this animal is hitherto but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly known: Ariſtotle ſays, it goes two years with young; which is the more likely, as the ſeaſon of deſire in the male returns but once in three years. The female produces one young at a time. The young Elephants are ſaid to ſuck with their trunk. The breaſts of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male are ſituated between its fore legs.</p>
               <p>This animal is thirty years in arriving at its full growth; and is ſaid to live, though in a ſtate of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to the age of a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty years: In a ſtate of unreſtrained freedom, they are ſuppoſed to live much longer.</p>
               <p>The Elephant will drink wine, and is fond of ſpiritous liquors. By ſhewing him a veſſel filled with arrack, he is induced to exert the greateſt efforts, and perform the moſt painful taſks, in hopes of receiving it as the reward of his labour. To diſappoint him is dangerous, as he ſeldom fails to be revenged. The following inſtance is given as a fact, and deſerves to be recorded:—An Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0209200900:167"/>
diſappointed of its reward, out of revenge killed his cornac or governor. The poor man's wife, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the dreadful ſcene, took her two infants, and threw them at the feet of the enraged animal, ſaying, 'Since you have ſlain my huſband, take my life alſo, as well as that of my children.' The Elephant inſtantly ſtopped, relented, and, as if ſtung with remorſe, took the eldeſt boy in its trunk, placed him on its neck, adopted him for its cornac, and would never allow any other perſon to mount it.</p>
               <p>This animal ſeems to know when it is mocked, and never fails to retaliate accordingly. A painter wiſhed to draw the animal in an unuſual attitude, with its trunk elevated, and its mouth open. In order to induce the Elephant to exhibit to more advantage, a perſon was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to throw fruit into its mouth, who ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it by only making an offer of doing ſo, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time the fruit in his hand. Enraged at this kind of treatment; and, as it ſhould ſeem, gueſſing the painter to be the cauſe, it threw out ſuch a quantity of water from its trunk, as ſpoiled his paper, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from proceeding in his work.</p>
               <p>We might quote many other facts equally curious and intereſting: Thoſe we have already recited are ſufficient to ſhew, that the Elephant is poſſeſſed of inſtinctive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſuperior to thoſe of any other animal. We muſt at the ſame time admire the admirable order of that diſpenſation, which, to an animal of ſuch unequalled powers, has added a diſpoſition ſo mild and tractable. What ravages might we not expect from the prodigious ſtrength of the Elephant, combined with the fierceneſs and rapacity of the Tiger!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0209200900:168"/>We cannot cloſe our account of the Elephant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking ſome notice of the teeth of that animal, which have been ſo frequently found in a foſſil ſtate in various parts of the world. Some years ago, two great grinding-teeth, and part of the tuſk of an Elephant, were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, at the depth of forty-two yards, in a lead mine, in Flintſhire, lying in a bed of gravel: The grinders were almoſt as perfect as if they had been juſt taken from the animal; the tuſk was much decayed, and very ſoft.— Near the banks of many rivers in Siberia, large tuſks and teeth have been frequently dug up, which have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to a creature called the <hi>Mammouth;</hi> but they are now univerſally believed to have belonged to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. The molares or grinders are perfectly the ſame with thoſe of the preſent race; but both they and the tuſks are much larger: Some of the latter have been known to weigh four hundred pounds; and grinders, of the weight of twenty-four pounds, have not unfrequently been diſcovered. One of theſe was taken from a ſkeleton of the ſame head in which the tuſks were found; and as the ivory of the latter was in every reſpect the ſame as that generally known, and made uſe of for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of uſeful and ornamental works, we cannot deny our aſſent to the opinion of thoſe who ſuppoſe them to have been once parts of the animals we have juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.—Tuſks of a prodigious ſize, teeth, jaw-bones, thigh-bones, and vertebrae, have likewiſe been frequently found on the banks of the rivet Ohio, in America, five or ſix feet beneath the ſurface. Some of the tuſks are near ſeven feet long, one foot nine inches in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at the baſe, and one foot near the point. They differ from thoſe of the Elephant in having a larger twiſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0209200900:169"/>
or ſpiral curve towards the ſmall end. There is a ſtill greater difference in the form of the grinders, which are made like thoſe of a carnivorous animal, not flat and ribbed tranſverſely on their ſurface, like thoſe of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, but furniſhed with a double row of high and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic projections, as if intended to maſticate, not grind, their food.—Specimens of theſe teeth and bones are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the Britiſh Muſeum, that of the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and in the cabinet of the late ingenious Dr Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—Theſe foſſil bones are alſo found in Peru, and in the Brazils.—As yet, the living animal has evaded the ſearch of the curious naturaliſt. It is not improbable, that it may exiſt in ſome of thoſe remote parts of that vaſt continent, yet impenetrated by Europeans.</p>

               <p>WE have hitherto been employed in the pleaſing taſk of deſcribing moſt of thoſe numerous tribes of animals that are more nearly connected with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of mankind; that ſerve as the inſtruments of man's happineſs, or at leaſt, that do not openly oppoſe him; that depend upon his care for their ſubſiſtence; and in their turn contribute largely to his comfort and ſupport.

               <p>WHICH is eminently diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, as well in ſize and ſtrength, as by his large and flowing mane.—This animal is produced in every part of Africa, and the hotteſt parts of Aſia. It is found in the greateſt numbers in the ſcorched and deſolate regions of the torrid zone, in the deſerts of Zaara and Biledul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerid, and in all the interior parts of the vaſt continent of Africa.—In theſe deſert regions, from whence man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are driven by the rigorous heat of the climate, this animal reigns ſole maſter; its diſpoſition ſeems to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ardour of its native ſoil; inflamed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a burning ſun, its rage is moſt tremendous, and its courage undaunted. Happily, indeed, the ſpecies
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0209200900:172"/>
is not numerous, and is ſaid to be greatly diminiſhed; for, if we may credit the teſtimony of thoſe who have traverſed theſe vaſt deſerts, the number of Lions is not nearly ſo great as formerly. Mr Shaw obſerves, that the Romans carried more Lions from Lybia in one year for their public ſpectacles, than could be found in all that country at this time. It is likewiſe remarked, that in Turkey, Perſia, and the Indies, Lions are not now ſo frequently met with as in former times.</p>
               <p>It is obſerved of this animal, that its courage dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, and its caution and timidity are greater, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as it approaches the habitations of the human race. Being acquainted with man, and the power of his arms, it loſes its natural fortitude to ſuch a degree, as to be terrified at the ſound of his voice. It has been known to fly even before women and children, who were found ſufficient to drive it away from its lurking places in the neighbourhood of their villages.</p>
               <p>This alteration in the Lion's diſpoſition ſufficiently ſhews, that it will admit of a certain degree of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And it is a well-known fact, that the keepers of wild beaſts frequently play with this animal, pull out his tongue, hold him by the teeth, and even chaſtiſe him without cauſe. The animal ſeems to bear all with a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len kind of compoſure, and rarely retaliates this unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited treatment. It is dangerous, however, to provoke him too far, or to depend upon his temper with too great ſecurity. Labat tells us of a gentleman who kept a Lion in his chamber, and employed a ſervant to attend it; who, as is uſual, mixed his blows with careſſes. This ill-judged aſſociation continued for ſome time. One morning the gentleman was awakened by an unuſual
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0209200900:173"/>
noiſe in his room; and, drawing his curtains, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to proceed from the Lion, which was growling over the body of the unhappy man, whom it had juſt killed, and had ſeparated his head from his body. The terror and confuſion of the gentleman may be eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: He flew out of the room, and with the aſſiſtance of ſome people, had the animal ſecured from doing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief.</p>
               <p>As the paſſions of this animal are ſtrong, and its appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites vehement, we ought not to preſume that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of education will always be ſufficiently power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It muſt be dangerous, therefore, to ſuffer it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main too long without food, or to perſiſt in irritating or abuſing it.—However, numberleſs accounts aſſure us, that the anger of the Lion is noble, its courage magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, and its temper ſuſceptible of grateful impreſſions. It has been often ſeen to deſpiſe weak and contemptible enemies, and even to pardon their inſults, when it was in its power to puniſh them. It has been known to ſpare the life of an animal that was thrown to be devoured by it, to live in habits of perfect cordiality with it, to ſhare its ſubſiſtence, and even to give it a preference where its portion of food was ſcanty.</p>
               <p>The form of the Lion is ſtrikingly bold and majeſtic: His large and ſhaggy mane, which he can erect at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſurrounding his awful front; his huge eye-brows; his round and fiery eye-balls, which, upon the leaſt irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſeem to glow with peculiar luſtre; together with the formidable appearance of his teeth, exhibit a picture of terrific grandeur, which no words can deſcribe.—The length of the largeſt Lion is between eight and nine feet, the tail about four feet, and its height about four feet
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0209200900:174"/>
and a half: The female is about one-fourth part leſs, and wants the mane.—As the Lion advances in years, its mane grows longer and thicker: The hair on the reſt of the body is ſhort and ſmooth, of a tawny colour, but whitiſh on the belly.—The roaring of the Lion is loud and dreadful; when heard in the night, it reſembles diſtant thunder; its cry of anger is much louder and ſhorter.</p>
               <p>The Lion ſeldom attacks any animal openly, except when compelled by extreme hunger: In that caſe, no danger deters him: But as moſt animals endeavour to avoid him, he is obliged to have recourſe to artifice, and take his prey by ſurprize. For this purpoſe, he crouches on his belly in ſome thicket, where he waits till his prey approaches; and then, with one prodigious ſpring, he leaps upon it at the diſtance of fifteen or twenty feet, and generally ſeizes it at the firſt bound: If he miſs his object, he gives up the purſuit; and, turning back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place of his ambuſh, he meaſures the ground ſtep by ſtep; and again lies in wait for another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The lurking-place of the Lion is generally choſen near a ſpring, or by the ſide of a river; where he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently has an opportunity of catching ſuch animals at come to quench their thirſt.</p>
               <p>There are, however, inſtances where the Lion deviates from his uſual method of taking his prey; of which the following, related by Sparrman, is remarkable:—A Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentot, perceiving that he was followed by a Lion, and concluding that the animal only waited the approach of night to make him his prey, began to conſider the beſt method of providing for his ſafety, which he at length effected in the following ſingular manner:—Obſerving a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0209200900:175"/>
piece of broken ground, with a precipitate deſcent on one ſide, he ſat down by the edge of it; and found, to his great joy, that the Lion alſo made a halt, and kept at the ſame diſtance as before. As ſoon as it grew dark, the Hottentot ſliding gently forward, let himſelf down a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle below the edge of the hill, and held up his cloak and hat upon his ſtick, making at the ſame time a gentle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it: The Lion, in the mean while, came creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoftly towards him, like a Cat; and miſtaking the ſkin cloak for the man himſelf, made a ſpring, and fell headlong down the precipice; by which means the poor Hottentot was ſafely delivered from his inſidious enemy.</p>
               <p>That the Lion does not always kill whatever animal happens to be in his power, has already been obſerved; and this peculiarity in the temper of this creature is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably obvious, with regard to the human ſpecies. Of this there have been many inſtances. At St Catherine Cree's church, Leadenhall-ſtreet, London, proviſion is made, under the will of Sir John Gager, who was Lord-Mayor in the year 1646, for a ſermon to be annually preached on the 16th of November, in commemoration of his happy deliverance from a Lion, which he met in a deſert as he was travelling in the Turkiſh dominions, and ſuffered him to paſs unmoleſted. The miniſter is to have 20s. for the ſermon, the clerk 2s. 6d. and the ſexton 1s.: The ſum of 8l. 16s. 6d. is likewiſe to be diſtributed among the neceſſitous inhabitants, purſuant to the will of Sir John.—Sparrman, among ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſame nature, mentions a perſon who, though he was thrown down by a Lion, and wounded by it in ſeveral places, was after all generouſly left with his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0209200900:176"/>The ſtrength of this animal is great: One of them was obſerved to ſeize a heifer, which it carried off in its mouth with eaſe, and leaped over a ditch with her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much apparent difficulty.</p>
               <p>At the Cape of Good Hope, the Lion is frequently hunted by the coloniſts. In the day time, and upon an open plain, twelve or ſixteen Dogs will eaſily get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a large Lion. As the Lion is not remarkably ſwift, the Dogs ſoon come pretty near him; when, with a ſullen kind of magnanimity, he turns round, and waits for the attack, ſhaking his mane, and roaring with a ſhort and ſharp tone. The hounds ſurround him; and, ruſhing upon him all at once, ſoon tear him to pieces. It is ſaid that he has ſeldom time to make more than two or three ſtrokes with his paws, each of which is attended with the death of one of his aſſailants.</p>
               <p>The Lioneſs goes with young five months, and brings forth three or four at a time. The young ones are about the ſize of a large pug Dog, harmleſs, pretty, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. They continue at the teat twelve months, and are above five years in coming to perfection.</p>
               <p>The Lion is a long-lived animal, although naturaliſts have differed greatly as to the preciſe period of its exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Buffon limits it to twenty, or twenty-two years at moſt. It is however certain, that it lives much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that time. The great Lion, called Pompey, which died in the year 1760, was known to have been in the Tower above ſeventy years; and one, brought from the river Gambia, died there not long ago at the age of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three.—Several of theſe animals have been bred in the Tower; ſo that the time of their geſtation, the number they produce, and the time of their arriving at perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are all pretty well known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0209200900:177"/>The attachment of the Lioneſs to her young is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſtrong: For their ſupport, ſhe is more fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than the Lion himſelf, makes her incurſions with greater boldneſs, deſtroys, without diſtinction, every ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal that falls in her way, and carries it reeking to her cubs. She uſually brings forth in the moſt retired and inacceſſible places; and when afraid of her retreat being diſcovered, endeavours to hide her track, by bruſhing the ground with her tail. When much diſturbed or alarmed, ſhe will ſometimes tranſport her young from one place to another in her mouth; and, if obſtructed in her courſe, will defend them to the laſt extremity.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Lion is ſaid to have a ſtrong, diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flavour; yet it is frequently eaten by the negroes. The ſkin, which was formerly a robe of diſtinction for heroes, is now made uſe of by thoſe people as a mantle or a bed. They alſo preſerve the greaſe, which is of a penetrating nature, and is uſed in medicine.</p>
               <p>The repreſentation we have given, was drawn from a remarkably fine one, exhibited at Newcaſtle in the year 1788. It was then young, exceedingly healthful, active, and in full condition.</p>

                  <figure/> THE TIGER</head>
               <p>is the moſt rapacious and deſtructive of all carnivorous animals. Fierce without provocation, and cruel without neceſſity, its thirſt for blood is inſatiable: Though glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſlaughter, it continues its carnage, nor ever gives up ſo long as a ſingle object remains in its ſight. Flocks and herds fall indiſcriminate victims to its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: It fears neither the ſight nor the oppoſition of man, whom it frequently makes its prey; and it is even ſaid to prefer human fleſh to that of any other animal.</p>
               <p>The Tiger is peculiar to Aſia; and is found as far North as China and Chineſe Tartary: It inhabits Mount Ararat, and Hyrcania of old, famous for its wild beaſts. The greateſt numbers are met with in India, and its iſlands: They are the ſcourge of the country: They lurk among the buſhes, by the ſides of rivers, and almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate many places.—They ſeldom purſue their prey; but bound upon it from the place of their ambuſh, with an elaſticity, and from a diſtance, ſcarcely credible.—It is highly probable, that, from this circumſtance, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0209200900:179"/>
may derive its name, which, in the Armenian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſignifies an arrow; to the flight of which this creature may very properly be compared, in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and agility of its bounds.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of this animal is ſo great, that, when it has killed an animal, whether it be a Horſe, a Buffalo, or a Deer, it carries it off with ſuch eaſe, that it ſeems no impediment to its flight. If it be undiſturbed, it plunges its head into the body of the animal up to its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eyes, as if to ſatiate itſelf with blood.</p>
               <p>The Tiger is perhaps the only animal whoſe ferocity can never be ſubdued: Neither gentleneſs nor conſtraint has any effect in ſoftening its temper. It does not ſeem ſenſible of the attention of its keeper; and would equally tear the hand that feeds, with that by which it is chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the cruelty of this creature's diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſudden check has ſometimes had a good effect in preventing its meditated attack. Some ladies and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being on a party of pleaſure, under a ſhade of trees, on the banks of a river in Bengal, were ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at ſeeing a Tiger ready to make its fatal ſpring: One of the ladies, with amazing preſence of mind, laid hold of an umbrella, and unfurling it directly in the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's face, it inſtantly retired.—Another party had not the ſame good fortune. A Tiger darted among them whilſt they were at dinner, ſeized on a gentleman, and carried him off in the ſight of his diſconſolate compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>They attack all kinds of animals, even the Lion; and furious combats have frequently been maintained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, in which both have periſhed. Father Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0209200900:180"/>
gives an account of a battle between a Tiger and two Elephants, at Siam, of which he was an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The heads, and part of the trunks of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, were defended from the claws of the Tiger by a covering made for the purpoſe. They were placed in the midſt of a large incloſure. One of them was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to approach the Tiger, which was confined by cords, and received two or three heavy blows from the trunk of the Elephant upon its back, which beat it to the ground, where it lay for ſome time as if it were dead: But, though this attack had a good deal abated its fury, it was no ſooner untied, than, with a horrible roar, it made a ſpring at the Elephant's trunk, which that animal dexterouſly avoided by drawing it up; and, receiving the Tiger on its tuſks, threw it up into the air. The two Elephants were then allowed to come up; and, after giving it ſeveral heavy blows, would undoubtedly have killed it, if an end had not been put to the combat.— Under ſuch reſtraints and diſadvantages, we cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the iſſue was unfavourable to the Tiger. We may, however, judge of its exceedingly great ſtrength and fierceneſs,—that, after being diſabled by the firſt attack of the Elephant, whilſt it was held by its cords, it would venture to continue ſuch an unequal engagement.</p>
               <p>We are happy in being able to preſent our curious readers with an engraving of this rare animal, drawn from the life, from a Tiger that was exhibited at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, in 1787; and was generally allowed to be one of the fineſt creatures of its kind ever ſeen in England. The beautiful bars of black with which every part of its body was ſtreaked, are accurately copied: The colour of the ground was yellow, deeper on the back, and ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0209200900:181"/>
by degrees towards the belly, where it was white; as were alſo the throat and inſides of the legs: A white ſpace, ſpotted with black, ſurrounded each eye; and on each cheek, a ſtripe of the ſame colour extended from the ears to the throat. It was nearly the ſame height as the Lion; and was of the largeſt ſpecies of the Tiger, which is called the <hi>Royal Tiger.</hi> The ſmalleſt of them is not above two feet high, ſaid to be extremely cunning, and delights in human fleſh. The ſecond kind is about three feet high, and is fond of Deer, wild Hogs, &amp;c. which it frequently takes by the ſides of rivers, as they come down to quench their thirſt.</p>
               <p>The ſkin of this animal is much eſteemed all over the Eaſt, particularly in China. The Mandarins cover their ſeats of juſtice with it; and, during the winter, uſe it for cuſhions and pillows.</p>
               <p>We have now deſcribed the two great heads of this miſchievous family, which are eminently diſtinguiſhed from the reſt in ſize, ſtrength, and colour. The three ſucceeding ſpecies have been frequently confounded with each other; and, although there is ſome difference in their ſize and in the diſpoſition of their ſpots, yet theſe have been ſo indiſcriminately defined, as to make it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to form a true criterion, ſo as accurately to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh each ſpecies. Strikingly ſimilar in the form of their bodies, in the beauty of their ſkins, as well as in their diſpoſitions and habits, which ſeem to be equally formed for rapine and cruelty; there is great room to conjecture, that commixture may be one great cauſe of producing the ſlight differences obſervable in theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If we regard the figure and diverſity of the ſpots, we ſhall find many varieties not taken notice of by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0209200900:182"/>
if we be led to judge by the ſize, we ſhall find an almoſt imperceptible gradation from the Cat to the Tiger. It would be vain, therefore, to make as many varieties in theſe animals, as we ſee differences in ſpots or ſtature: It will be ſufficient to point out the moſt general diſtinctions.</p>

               <p>is next in ſize to the Tiger; and has, by many natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, been miſtaken for that animal.—Its hair is ſhort and ſmooth; and, inſtead of being ſtreaked like the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is beautifully marked on the back, ſides, and flanks, with black ſpots, diſpoſed in circles, from four to five in each, with a ſingle ſpot in the centre: On the face, breaſt, and legs, the ſpots are ſingle: The colour of the body on the back and ſides is yellow, deep on the back, and paler towards the belly, which is white; its ears are ſhort and pointed; its eye is reſtleſs; and its whole aſpect fierce and cruel.—It is an untameable animal; and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits Africa, from Barbary to the remoteſt parts of Guinea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0209200900:183"/>Its manner of taking its prey is the ſame with that of the Tiger, always by ſurprize, either lurking in thickets, or creeping on its belly till it comes within reach. When preſſed with hunger, it attacks every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without diſtinction, but happily prefers the fleſh of brutes to that of mankind: It will even climb up trees in purſuit of monkies and leſſer animals; ſo that nothing is ſecure from its attacks.</p>
               <p>The Panther is about the ſize of a large Maſtiff Dog; but its legs are not quite ſo long. Its voice is ſtrong and hoarſe; and it growls continually.</p>
               <p>The ancients were well acquainted with theſe animals. The Romans drew prodigious numbers from the deſerts of Africa for their public ſhews; ſufficient, one might ſuppoſe, to have entirely exhauſted them. Scaurus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited an hundred and fifty of them at one time; Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey four hundred and ten; and Auguſtus four hundred and twenty. They probably thinned the coaſts of Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania of theſe animals; but they ſtill ſwarm in the ſouthern parts of Guinea.</p>
               <p>In China, there is a moſt beautiful animal of this kind, called <hi>Louchu;</hi> the ſkin of which ſells for ſix pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.—An animal of this ſpecies is likewiſe found in Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic Tartary, called there the <hi>Babr.</hi> It is ſeven feet long, extremely rapacious, and very deſtructive of Horſes and Camels. Its ſkin is very fine, and valued in Ruſſia at one pound ſterling.</p>

               <p>The very trifling difference between this and the laſt-mentioned animal gives reaſon to ſuppoſe, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly in the name. It inhabits the ſame countries; and in ſome places goes by the ſame name, being called the <hi>Panther of Senegal,</hi> where it is chiefly found. It is mentioned by Ray as the female Panther; is rather ſmaller than that animal; its length, from noſe to tail, is about four feet; the colour of the body is a more lively yellow; and the ſpots with which it is diverſified, are ſmaller and cloſer than thoſe of the Panther.</p>
               <p>The interior parts of Africa abound with theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; from whence they come down in great numbers, and make dreadful havock among the numerous herds that cover the plains of the Lower Guinea. When beaſts of chaſe fail, they ſpare no living creature.</p>
               <p>The negroes take them in pitfalls, ſlightly covered at the top, and baited with fleſh. Their chief inducement for purſuing them is their fleſh, which they eat, and is ſaid to be white as veal, and well taſted. The negreſſes
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0209200900:185"/>
make collars of their teeth, and wear them as charms, to which they attribute certain virtues.</p>
               <p>The ſkins of theſe animals are brought to Europe, where they are greatly eſteemed.</p>
               <p>In India, there is a ſpecies of this animal about the ſize of a large Greyhound, with a ſmall head, and ſhort ears; its face, chin, and throat, of a pale-brown colour, inclining to yellow; the body is of a light tawny-brown, marked with ſmall round black ſpots, ſcattered over the back, ſides, head, and legs; the inſide of the legs plain; the hair on the top of the neck is longer than the reſt; the belly white; the tail very long, marked on the upper ſide with large black ſpots, and the hair on the under ſide is very long.</p>
               <p>This is the animal, mentioned in our account of the Antelope, which is made uſe of in India for hunting that and other beaſts of the chaſe.—It is carried in a ſmall kind of waggon, chained and hoodwinked till it approaches the herd; when it is unchained, and ſuffered to purſue the game. It begins by creeping along, with its belly cloſe to the ground, ſtopping and concealing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf till it get an advantageous ſituation; it then darts on its prey with great agility, frequently making five or ſix amazing bounds. If it ſhould not ſucceed in its firſt effort, it gives up the point for that time, and readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to its maſter.</p>

               <p>is ſmaller than the Leopard, being three feet and a half long from the noſe to the tail, very ſtrong, long-backed, and ſhort-legged. The hair is long, and of a light-grey colour, tinged with yellow; lighter on the breaſt and belly: The head is marked with ſmall round ſpots: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind each ear there is a large black ſpot: The back is beautifully varied with a number of oval figures, formed by ſmall ſpots almoſt touching each other; the ſpots on the ſides are more irregular; thoſe on the legs and thighs ſmall, and thinly diſperſed: The tail is full of hair, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly marked with large black ſpots, and upwards of three feet long.</p>
               <p>This animal is common in Barbary, Perſia, and China; is much more gentle than the Leopard; and, like the Hunting Leopard, is trained to the chaſe. It is often uſed in hunting Antelopes, and even Hares. Inſtead of being conveyed in a waggon, it is carried on the crupper of the Horſe, is as much under command as a Setting Dog, returns at a call, and jumps up behind its maſter.</p>

Dog. It neither follows animals by their foot, nor is it able to overtake them in a continued chaſe. It hunts ſolely by the eye, and makes only a few ſprings at its prey. It is ſo nimble, as to clear a ditch or a wall of many feet. It often climbs trees to watch animals that are paſſing, and ſuddenly darts upon them.</p>
               <p>It is ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Leſſer Panther</hi> of Oppian, and the <hi>Panthera</hi> of Pliny.</p>

               <p>is the moſt formidable animal of the new continent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther larger than the Panther, with hair of a bright-tawny colour. The top of the back is marked with long ſtripes of black; the ſides beautifully variegated with irregular oblong ſpots, open in the middle; the tail not ſo long as that of the Ounce, irregularly marked with large black ſpots.</p>
               <p>It is found in the hotteſt parts of South-America; is a very fierce animal; and, when preſſed with hunger, will ſometimes venture to ſeize a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0209200900:188"/>The Indians are much afraid of it, and think it prefers them to the white inhabitants, who, perhaps, are better prepared to repel its attacks.—In travelling through the deſerts of Guiana, they light great fires in the night, of which theſe animals are much afraid.</p>
               <p>They howl dreadfully. Their cry, which is expreſſive of the two monoſyllables—<hi>hou, hou,</hi> is ſomewhat plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, grave, and ſtrong, like that of an Ox.</p>
               <p>The Ant-eater, though it has no teeth to defend itſelf with, is the moſt cruel enemy the Jaguar has to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As ſoon as the Jaguar attacks this little animal, it lies down on its back, and, with its long claws, ſeizes and ſuffocates him.</p>

               <p>inhabits the continent of America, and is called by ſome the <hi>Puma,</hi> or <hi>American Lion;</hi> but differs ſo much from that noble animal, as not to admit of any degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.—Its head is ſmall; it has no mane; its length, from noſe to tail, is five feet three inches; the tail two
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0209200900:189"/>
feet long. The predominant colour of this animal is a lively red, mixed with black; eſpecially on the back, where it is darkeſt: Its chin, throat, and all the inferior parts of its body, are whitiſh; its legs are long; claws white; the outer claw of the fore feet much longer than the others.</p>
               <p>It is found in many parts of North-America, from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada to Florida: It is alſo common in Guiana, Brazil, and Mexico.</p>
               <p>This animal is fierce and ravenous in the extreme, and will ſwim rivers to attack cattle even in their incloſures. In North-America, its fury ſeems to be ſubdued by the rigour of the climate; for it will fly from a Dog in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with its maſter, and take ſhelter by running up a tree.</p>
               <p>It is very deſtructive to domeſtic animals; particularly to Hogs. It preys alſo upon the Mooſe and other Deer; lies lurking upon the branch of a tree till ſome of theſe animals paſs underneath, when it drops down upon one of them, and never quits its hold till it has drunk its blood. It will even attack beaſts of prey. In the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum of the Royal Society is preſerved the ſkin of one of theſe animals, which was ſhot juſt as it had ſeized a Wolf.</p>
               <p>When it is ſatisfied with eating, it conceals the reſt of the carcaſe, covering it carefully with leaves.—It purrs like a Cat, and ſometimes howls dreadfully.</p>
               <p>The fur is ſoft, and is uſed by the Indians for a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter habit; when dreſſed, it is made into gloves and ſhoes. The fleſh is white, and, by the natives, reckoned very good.</p>

The throat, belly, and inſide of the legs, are of a pale-aſh colour; the upper lip white, covered with long whiſkers; above each eye, it has very long hairs; and at the corner of the mouth, a black ſpot; its paws are white; and its ears ſharp and pointed.</p>
               <p>This animal grows to the ſize of a heifer of a year old, and has great ſtrength in its limbs.—It inhabits Brazil and Guiana, is a cruel and fierce animal, much dreaded by the Indians; but fortunately the ſpecies is not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>

                  <figure/> THE OCELOT.</head>
               <p>Of all ſpotted animals, the ſkin of the male Ocelot is the moſt beautiful, and the moſt elegantly variegated. Its general colour is that of a bright-tawny; a black ſtripe extends along the top of the back, from head to tail; its forehead is ſpotted with black, as are alſo its legs; its ſhoulders, ſides, and rump, are beautifully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with long ſtripes of black, forming oval figures, filled in the middle with ſmall black ſpots; its tail is irregularly marked with large ſpots, and black at the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0209200900:192"/>The Ocelot very much reſembles the common Cat in the form of its body, although it is a great deal larger. Buffon makes its height two feet and a half, and about four feet in length.</p>
               <p>The colours of the female are not ſo vivid as thoſe of the male, nor the marks ſo beautifully formed.</p>
               <p>The Ocelot is a native of South-America, inhabits Mexico and Brazil, is a very voracious animal, but ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, and ſeldom attacks men. It is afraid of Dogs; and when purſued, flies to the woods.</p>
               <p>This creature lives chiefly in the mountains, where it conceals itſelf amongſt the leaves of trees; from whence it darts upon ſuch animals as come within its reach. It ſometimes extends itſelf along the boughs, as if it were dead, till the monkies, tempted by their natural curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, approach within reach of its paws; when it ſeizes and kills them.—It is ſaid to prefer the blood of animals to their fleſh. It muſt, therefore, deſtroy great numbers, as, inſtead of ſatisfying its hunger by devouring them, it only quenches its thirſt by drinking their blood.</p>
               <p>The Ocelot is not eaſy to be tamed, and retains its original wildneſs in a ſtate of captivity. Nothing can ſoften the natural ferocity of its diſpoſition, nor calm the reſtleſſneſs of its motions: For this reaſon, it is always kept in a cage.—One of theſe animals, ſhewn at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle in 1788, although extremely old, exhibited great marks of ferocity. It was kept cloſely confined, and would not admit of being careſſed by its keeper in the ſame manner as the Lion; but growled conſtantly, and always appeared in motion.—A male and female Ocelot were brought to France ſome years ago, which had been taken when very young. At the age of three months,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0209200900:193"/>
they became ſo ſtrong and fierce, as to kill a bitch that was given them for a nurſe. When a live Cat was thrown to them, they ſucked its blood, but would not taſte its fleſh. The male ſeemed to have a great ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over the female, as he never allowed her to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take till his own appetite was ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>The female Ocelot, like all the larger animals of the Cat kind, produces a ſmall number at a time. The two above mentioned were the only young ones found with the mother, which was killed at the time they were taken; and makes it probable, that they bring forth only that number.</p>

               <p>The Margay is ſmaller than the Ocelot, and about the

ſize of the Wild Cat, which it reſembles in diſpoſition and habit, living on ſmall animals, birds, &amp;c. It is very wild and untameable, and cannot eaſily be brought under ſubjection.—Its colours vary, though they are generally ſuch as have been deſcribed.</p>
               <p>It is common in Guiana, Brazil, and various parts of South-America.—It is called the <hi>Cayenne Cat;</hi> and is not ſo frequent in temperate as in warm climates.</p>
               <p>In taking a ſurvey of this beautiful race of animals, we are unavoidably led to obſerve, that much remains for the laborious reſearches of the natural hiſtorian, before a complete account can be made out of the various kinds of which it is compoſed. Several ſpecies are frequently found in the Eaſt-Indies, in the woods near the Cape of Good Hope, and in the continent of America; but in general theſe have been ſo negligently, or ſo injudiciouſly mentioned, as to render it impoſſible to form a perfect deſcription of them.—A good hiſtory of theſe animals is one of the many deſiderata of the naturaliſt; but when we conſider the great diſtance which moſt of this fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tribe obſerve in their ſeparation from mankind, and the dangers that muſt be encountered in approaching their ſolitary habitations, we are obliged to lament that this deſirable object is not likely to be ſoon accompliſhed.</p>

               <p>This beautiful animal inhabits the mountainous parts of India; and is called by the natives of Malabar the <hi>Marapute.</hi>—It is larger than the Wild Cat. Its general colour is a pale-yellow; white on the breaſt and belly, variegated with round ſpots, which are equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted over every part of its body: Its eyes are extremely brilliant, and have a wild, piercing look; its whiſkers are long and ſtiff; its tail ſhort; and its feet are armed with long hooked claws.</p>
               <p>This creature is ſeldom to be ſeen upon the ground; but lives chiefly in trees, where it makes its neſt, and breeds its young. It feeds on young birds, and leaps with great agility from tree to tree. It is extremely fierce; but avoids mankind, unleſs provoked; when it darts furiouſly upon the offender, and tears and bites nearly in the ſame manner as the Panther.</p>
               <p>Sparrman mentions an animal of this kind, found at
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0209200900:196"/>
the Cape of Good Hope, which he calls the <hi>Tiger Cat,</hi> and ſuppoſes to be the ſame with the Serval. The ſame author mentions another animal of this kind, called at the Cape the <hi>Wild Red Cat;</hi> the ſkin of which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the natives to poſſeſs great medicinal powers, and give eaſe to perſons afflicted with the gout, lumba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and pains in the joints. The hairy ſide muſt be worn next the part affected. The fur of this animal is very fine and ſoft; and probably, there are many other ſkins, which, if applied with an equal degree of good faith, might have the ſame ſalutary effects.</p>
               <p>The colour of the upper part of this creature is of a very bright-red; towards the ſides it is mixed with white and grey; the belly is white; the upper part of the ears, which have tufts of hair on their tips, is dark-brown, ſprinkled with grey. The body of this animal is long, and about two feet in height.</p>

               <p>The hiſtory of this animal is ſo intimately connected with that of the common or domeſtic kind, that we ſhall
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0209200900:197"/>
include our account of both under one general head, and deſcribe them as conſtituting the ſame ſpecies.</p>
               <p>The domeſtic Cat, if ſuffered to eſcape into the woods, becomes wild, and lives on ſmall birds and ſuch other game as it can find there. It likewiſe breeds with the wild one. It is no uncommon thing for females of the tame ſpecies to quit their houſes during the time they are in ſeaſon, go in queſt of male Wild Cats, and return home to the ſame habitations impregnated by them. It is by this means, that ſome of our domeſtic Cats ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſemble thoſe of the wild breed.</p>
               <p>The hair of the Wild Cat is ſoft and fine, of a pale-yellow colour, mixed with grey; a duſky liſt runs along the middle of the back, from head to tail; the ſides are ſtreaked with grey, pointing from the back downwards; the tail is thick, and marked with alternate bars of black and white. It is larger and ſtronger than the tame Cat, and its fur much longer.</p>
               <p>This animal inhabits the moſt mountainous and woody parts of this iſland, living in trees, and hunting for birds and ſmall animals, ſuch as rabbits, hares, rats, mice, moles, &amp;c. It frequently makes great havock among poultry; will even kill young lambs, kids, and fawns; and is the fierceſt and moſt deſtructive beaſt of prey in this kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is taken either in traps, or by ſhooting. There is frequently danger in the latter mode; for if it be only ſlightly wounded, it will attack the perſon who has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured it, and in that caſe is not eaſily repelled.</p>
               <p>Wild Cats are found, with very little variety, in almoſt every climate. They exiſted in America before its diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by the Europeans. One of them was brought to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0209200900:198"/>
Columbus, which was of the ordinary ſize, of a brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh-grey colour, with a long tail.—They are common in many places of Aſia and Africa. Sparrman gives a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of one which he ſhot at the Cape, which was in every reſpect ſimilar to thoſe of this country. It was of a grey colour; and meaſured, from the noſe to the tail, nearly twenty-two inches. The tail was thirteen inches long. Its height was about a foot and a half. Its inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines were full of moles and rats.</p>
               <p>Some Wild Cats have been taken in this kingdom of a moſt enormous ſize; we recollect one having been killed in the county of Cumberland, which meaſured, from its noſe to the end of its tail, upwards of five feet.</p>
               <p>The province of Chorazan, in Perſia, is particularly famous for a moſt beautiful Cat, about the ſize of the tame one, of a fine grey colour, without any mixture, and as ſoft and ſhining as ſilk. It is darker on the back, ſoftening by degrees towards the breaſt and belly, where it is almoſt white. The tail is long, and covered with hair, five or ſix inches in length. The animal frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turns it upon its back, like a ſquirrel; the point of it reſembling a plume of feathers.</p>
               <p>The Cat of Angora differs greatly from the Wild Cat, in having much longer hair, eſpecially about the neck, where it forms a fine ruff, and gives the creature a Lion-like appearance. Some of theſe are of a ſilvery white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſilky texture; others are of a dun colour, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with yellow.</p>

                  <figure/> THE DOMESTIC CAT</head>
               <p>may be ſaid to be only a variety of the Wild Cat, the principal difference being in its ſize, which is leſs; and, inſtead of being uniformly the ſame, is diſtinguiſhed by an infinite variety of ſhades and colouring.</p>
               <p>To deſcribe an animal ſo well known might ſeem a ſuperfluous taſk; we ſhall only, therefore, ſelect ſuch of its peculiarities as are leaſt obvious, and may have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the notice of inattentive obſervers.</p>
               <p>It is generally remarked, that Cats can ſee in the dark; but, though this is not abſolutely the caſe, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they can ſee with much leſs light than moſt other animals, owing to the peculiar ſtructure of their eyes, the pupils of which are capable of being contracted or dilated in proportion to the degree of light by which they are affected. The pupil of the Cat, during the day, is perpetually contracted; and it is with difficulty that it can ſee by a ſtrong light: But in the twilight, the pupil
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0209200900:200"/>
reſumes its natural roundneſs, the animal enjoys perfect viſion, and takes advantage of this ſuperiority to diſcover and ſurprize its prey.</p>
               <p>The cry of the Cat is loud, piercing, and clamorous; and whether expreſſive of anger or of love, is equally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and hideous. Its call may be heard at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and is ſo well known to the whole fraternity, that on ſome occaſions ſeveral hundred Cats have been brought together from different parts. Invited by the piercing cries of diſtreſs from a ſuffering fellow-creature, they aſſemble in crowds; and, with loud ſqualls and yells, expreſs their horrid ſympathies. They frequently tear the miſerable object to pieces; and, with the moſt blind and furious rage, fall upon each other, killing and wounding indiſcriminately, till there is ſcarcely one left. Theſe terrible conflicts happen only in the night; and, though very rare, inſtances of very furious ones are well authenticated.</p>
               <p>The Cat is particularly averſe to water, cold, and bad ſmells. It is fond of certain perfumes; but is more particularly attracted by the ſmell of valerian, marum, and cat-mint. It rubs itſelf againſt them; and, if not prevented from coming at them in a garden where they are planted, would infallibly deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>The Cat brings forth twice, and ſometimes thrice, a year. The period of her geſtation is fifty-five or fifty-ſix days; and ſhe generally produces five or ſix at one litter. She conceals her kittens from the male, leſt he ſhould devour them, as he is ſometimes inclined; and, if appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of being diſturbed, will take them up in her mouth, and remove them one by one to a more ſecure retreat. Even the female herſelf, contrary to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0209200900:201"/>
law of Nature, which binds the parent to its off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring by an almoſt indiſſoluble tie, is ſometimes known to eat her own young the moment after ſhe has produced them.</p>
               <p>Though extremely uſeful in deſtroying the vermin that infeſt our houſes, the Cat ſeems little attached to the perſons of thoſe that afford it protection. It ſeems to be under no ſubjection, and acts only for itſelf: All its news are confined to the place where it has been brought up; if carried elſewhere, it ſeems loſt and bewildered: Neither careſſes nor attention can reconcile it to its new ſituation; and it frequently takes the firſt opportunity of eſcaping to its former haunts. Frequent inſtances are in our recollection, of Cats having returned to the place from whence they had been carried, though at many miles diſtance, and even acroſs rivers, when they could not poſſibly have any knowledge of the road or ſituation that would apparently lead them to it.—This extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary faculty is, however, poſſeſſed in a much greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree by Dogs; yet it is in both animals equally wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unaccountable.</p>
               <p>In the time of Hoel the Good, king of Wales, who died in the year 948, laws were made as well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as to fix the different prices of animals; among which the Cat was included, as being at that period of great importance, on account of its ſcarcity and utility. The price of a kitten before it could ſee was fixed at one penny; till proof could be given of its having caught a mouſe, two-pence; after which it was rated at four-pence, which was a great ſum in thoſe days, when the value of ſpecie was extremely high. It was likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that it ſhould be perfect in its ſenſes of hearing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0209200900:202"/>
and ſeeing, ſhould be a good mouſer, have its claws whole, and, if a female, be a careful nurſe: If it failed in any of theſe good qualities, the ſeller was to forfeit to the buyer the third part of its value.—If any one ſhould ſteal or kill the Cat that guarded the Prince's granary, he was either to forfeit a milch ewe, her fleece, and lamb, or as much wheat as, when poured on the Cat ſuſpended by its tail, (its head touching the floor) would form a heap high enough to cover the tip of the former.— From hence we may conclude, that Cats were not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally natives of theſe iſlands; and, from the great care taken to improve and preſerve the breed of this prolific creature, we may ſuppoſe were but little known at that period.—Whatever credit we may allow to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the well-known ſtory of Whittington and his Cat, it is another proof of the great value ſet upon this animal in former times.</p>

               <p>differs greatly from every animal of the Cat kind we have hitherto deſcribed. Its ears are long and erect, tufted at the end with long black hairs, by which this ſpecies of animals is peculiarly diſtinguiſhed: The hair on the body is long and ſoft, of a red-aſh colour, marked with duſky ſpots, which differ according to the age of the creature; ſometimes they are ſcarcely viſible: Its legs and feet are very thick and ſtrong; its tail ſhort, and black at the extremity; its eyes are of a pale-yellow colour; and its aſpect ſofter and leſs ferocious than that of the Panther or the Ounce. The ſkin of the male is more ſpotted than that of the female.</p>
               <p>The fur of this creature is valuable for its ſoftneſs and warmth; and is imported in great quantities from Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica and the North of Europe. The farther North they are taken, the whiter they are, and the ſpots more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. The moſt elegant of thoſe is called the <hi>Irbys;</hi> and is taken near lake Balkaſh, in Uſbec Tartary. Its ſkin

ſells in that country for one pound ſterling.—The colour of its hair changes with the climate and the ſeaſon: The winter furs are richer and more beautiful than thoſe taken in ſummer.</p>
               <p>The Lynx is ſaid to be very long-lived, is a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive animal, lives by hunting, and purſues its prey to the tops of the higheſt trees. It feeds on Weaſels, Ermines, Squirrels, &amp;c. which are unable to eſcape it. It watches the approach of the Fallow-deer, Hare, and other animals; and darts upon them from the branches of trees, where it lies concealed; ſeizes the animals by the throat, and drinks their blood; after which, it aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons them, and goes in queſt of freſh game.—Its ſight is remarkably quick; and it ſees its prey at a great diſtance. —It often eats no more of a Sheep or a Goat than the brain, the liver, and the inteſtines. It will ſometimes dig under the doors to gain admiſſion into the ſheepfold. —When attacked by a Dog, it lies down on its back, ſtrikes deſperately with its claws, and frequently obliges its aſſailant to retreat.</p>
               <p>Although the Lynx has nothing in common with the Wolf, it has been diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Lupus-Cervarius,</hi> or the <hi>Stag-Wolf.</hi> Its manner of howling is ſimilar to that of the Wolf; and when heard at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is not eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the cry of that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. The epithet <hi>cervarius</hi> has been added, becauſe its ſkin is variegated with ſpots like that of a young Stag.</p>
               <p>A variety of this animal is found in the inner parts of the province of New York. It is called the <hi>Bay Lynx,</hi> and is about twice the ſize of a large Cat. Its hair is ſhort and ſmooth; its general colour is a bright-bay, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely marked with duſky ſpots; on its face there are
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0209200900:205"/>
black ſtripes, pointing downward towards the noſe; on each ſide of the upper lip it has three rows of ſmall black ſpots, with long whiſkers iſſuing from them; each cheek is marked with long black ſtripes, of a circular form, proceeding from the corners of the eyes; the under part of the body, and inſides of the legs, are white; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of each fore leg is marked on the upper part with two black bars; its tail, which is ſhort, is marked with bars of a duſky colour, and at the end with one of a deep-black; the tip and under ſide are white.</p>
               <p>The Lynxes of our days muſt be very different ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals from thoſe which have been deſcribed by poets as drawing the chariot of Bacchus; for, beſide the imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of training theſe animals to the yoke, we find, that the Lynx is not an inhabitant of India, or of any of the warmer countries of Aſia conquered by that hero. It prefers cold to even temperate climates; and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the foreſts of the northern parts of Europe, Aſia, and America.</p>
               <p>The ancients ſeem to have given the name of <hi>Lynx</hi> to an animal which exiſted only in imagination, and may be ranked with their other ideal monſters and prodigies —the Sphynx, the Pegaſus, and the Unicorn.—Its ſight was ſaid to penetrate the moſt opaque bodies, and its urine to be converted into a precious ſtone.</p>

                  <figure/> THE CARACAL</head>
               <p>reſembles the Lynx in ſize, figure, and aſpect, as well as in having its ears tipt with a pencil of black hairs.—It differs from the laſt-mentioned animal in not being ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; its hair is rougher, and of a pale reddiſh-brown; its tail is longer, and of an uniform colour; its face is more lengthened, its look more fierce, and its nature and diſpoſition more ſavage.</p>
               <p>This animal is found only in warm climates; and is common in Perſia, India, Barbary, and in all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries inhabited by the Lion, the Panther, and the Ounce. —It is called in Perſia the <hi>Syah-Guſh;</hi> and in the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh language, the <hi>Karrah-Kulak:</hi> Both theſe names ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the <hi>Cat with black Ears.</hi>—It is ſaid to follow the Lion, and to feed on the remains which that animal leaves of his prey; for which reaſon it is called among the Arabs the <hi>Lion's Guide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caracal is about the ſize of a Fox; but much
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0209200900:207"/>
ſtronger, and more ferocious. It has been known to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack a Hound, and inſtantly tear it to pieces.</p>
               <p>This animal is extremely difficult to tame; but when taken young, and reared with great caution, it may be trained to the chaſe.</p>
               <p>It is uſed in purſuing the ſmaller ſort of animals, in which it is very ſucceſsful; but it is active only in the purſuit of animals that are too feeble for reſiſtance, or too timid to exert their powers. Whenever it meets with one that is ſuperior to it in ſtrength, it loſes its courage, and gives up the chaſe.—It is likewiſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in catching birds; ſuch as cranes, pelicans, peacocks, &amp;c.; which it ſurpriſes with ſingular addreſs. When it has ſeized its prey, it holds it faſt in its mouth, and lies upon it for ſome time quite motionleſs.</p>
               <p>There are ſome varieties in this animal. The face of the Nubian Caracal is rounder; the ears black on the outſide, interſperſed with ſilver-coloured hairs; on the breaſt, belly, and inſides of the thighs, there are ſmall bright-yellow ſpots; and it has the mule croſs on the withers, like moſt of the Barbary Caracals.—In Lybia, there are Caracals with white ears, tufted at the end with thin black hairs; they have white tails, the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of which are ſurrounded with four black rings; and on the hind part of each leg, there are four black ſpots. They are ſmaller than the other Caracals, not exceeding the ſize of a domeſtic Cat.</p>
               <p>We have now gone through all the principal varieties which conſtitute this numerous race; in all of which, as has been already obſerved, from the Lion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cat, we may perceive a ſtriking ſimilitude in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, form, and manners. This agreement is likewiſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0209200900:208"/>
obſervable in their internal conformation, which is ſtill more exact,—in the ſhortneſs of their inteſtines, the ſharpneſs and number of their teeth, and in the ſtructure of their feet and claws. They are all equally carnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and tear, rather than chew their meat. They eat ſlowly; and growl whilſt they feed, as if afraid of loſing their prey. They are all cowardly, and ſeldom make an attack but where conqueſt is certain.</p>
               <p>Animals of this race may be conſidered as the moſt formidable enemies of mankind. There are others more powerful; but their diſpoſitions are milder; and they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom offend till they find themſelves injured: Others are more numerous; but they are weaker, and find their ſafety not in oppoſing, but in flying from man. Theſe are the only quadrupeds that in any degree make good their ground againſt him, and maintain a kind of divided ſway over many fair and fertile tracts, that ſeem, in other reſpects, formed for the comfort and convenience of ſocial life.</p>

               <head>ANIMALS OF THE WEASEL KIND.</head>
               <p>THESE little, active, and enterprizing animals are particularly diſtinguiſhed from other carnivorous kinds, by the length and ſlenderneſs of their bodies, which are admirably adapted to their manner of living, and methods of taking their prey. They are ſo ſmall and flexible, as to wind like worms into very ſmall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and openings; whither they eaſily follow the little animals that ſerve them for food.</p>
               <p>All the animals of this kind are furniſhed with ſmall glands, placed near the anus, from which an unctuous matter continually exudes: The effluvia of it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offenſive in the Polecat, Ferret, Weaſel, Badger,  but in the Civet Cat, Martin, and Pine Weaſel, it is an agreeable perfume. They are all equally marked for rapine and cruelty: They ſubſiſt only by theft; and find their chief protection in their minuteneſs. They are all, from the ſhortneſs of their legs, ſlow in purſuit; and make up that deficiency by patience, aſſiduity, and cunning.—As their prey is precarious, they can live a long time without food. When they fall in with plenty, they immediately kill every thing within their reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they begin to ſatisfy their appetite; and always ſuck the blood of every animal they kill, before they eat any of its fleſh.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal peculiarities common to this kind; all the ſpecies of which have ſo ſtriking a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to each other, that having ſeen one, we may form a very juſt idea of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The moſt obvious difference conſiſts in their ſize. We ſhall therefore begin with the ſmalleſt of this numerous claſs, and proceed gradually upwards to the largeſt.</p>

                  <figure/> THE WEASEL.</head>
               <p>THE length of this animal does not exceed ſeven inches, from the noſe to the tail; which is only two inches and a half long, and ends in a point: Its height is not above two inches and a half; ſo that it is nearly five times as long as it is high.</p>
               <p>The moſt prevailing colour of the Weaſel is a pale reddiſh-brown on the back, ſides, and legs; the throat and belly are white; beneath the corners of the mouth, on each jaw, is a ſpot of brown. It has whiſkers like a Cat; its ears are large, and have a fold at the lower part, that gives them the appearance of being double; its eyes are ſmall, round, and black; its teeth are thirty-two in number, and extremely ſharp.</p>
               <p>The Weaſel is very common, and well known in moſt parts of this country; is very deſtructive to young birds, poultry, rabbits, &amp;c.; and is a keen devourer of eggs, which it ſucks with great avidity. It will follow a Hare, which is terrified into a ſtate of abſolute imbecility at the ſight of this little animal, and gives itſelf up to it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0209200900:211"/>
reſiſtance, making at the ſame time the moſt piteous outcries.</p>
               <p>The bite of the Weaſel is generally fatal. It ſeizes its prey near the head, and fixes its ſharp teeth into a vital part. A Hare, Rabbit, or any other ſmall animal, bit in this manner, is never known to recover; but lingers for ſome time, and dies. The wound is ſo ſmall, that the place where the teeth enter can ſcarcely be perceived. —It is remarkably active; and will run up the ſides of a wall with ſuch facility, that no place is ſecure from it.</p>
               <p>This creature is a friend to the farmer, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by him. During winter, it frequents his barns, out-houſes, and granaries; which it effectually clears of Rats and Mice. It is, indeed, a more deadly enemy to them than even the Cat itſelf; for, being more active and ſlender, it purſues them into their holes, and kills them after a ſhort reſiſtance. It creeps alſo into pigeon holes, and deſtroys the young ones; catches ſparrows, and all kinds of ſmall birds; and when it has brought forth its young, it hunts with ſtill greater boldneſs and avidity.—In ſummer, it ventures at a diſtance from its uſual haunts; is frequently found by the ſide of waters, near corn-mills; and is almoſt ſure to follow wherever a ſwarm of Rats has taken poſſeſſion of any place.</p>
               <p>The evening is the time when this animal begins its depredations. Towards the cloſe of the day, it may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be ſeen ſtealing from its hole, and creeping about the farmer's yard in ſearch of its prey. If it enter the place where poultry are kept, it ſeldom attacks the cocks or the old hens, but always aims at the young ones. It does not eat its prey on the ſpot where it has killed it; but, where it is not too large, carries it away to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0209200900:212"/>
It alſo breaks and ſucks all the eggs it can meet with; and, not unfrequently, kills the hen that attempts to defend them.</p>
               <p>The Weaſel is a wild and untractable little animal: When kept in a cage for the purpoſe of amuſement or inſpection, it ſeems in a continual ſtate of agitation, is terrified at the ſight of every perſon that approaches to look at it, and hides itſelf in the wool or hay which is given to it for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It conveys all its food to its hiding-place; and will not touch it till it begin to putrefy. It paſſes the greateſt part of the day in ſleeping; and uſually employs the night in exerciſe and eating.</p>
               <p>The female brings forth in the ſpring, and generally produces four or five at one litter. She prepares a bed for them of ſtraw, leaves, and moſs. The young are brought forth blind; but very ſoon acquire ſtrength enough to follow their dam, and aſſiſt in her excurſions. They will attack ſerpents, water-rats, moles, field-mice, &amp;c.: They overrun the meadows; and frequently kill the partridges, and ſuck their eggs.</p>
               <p>The motion of the Weaſel conſiſts of unequal and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant leaps; and in climbing a tree, it makes a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſpring of ſome feet from the ground. It jumps in the ſame manner upon its prey; and being extremely limber, evades the attempts of much ſtronger animals to ſeize it.—We are told, that an eagle having ſeized a Weaſel, mounted into the air with it; and was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſerved to be in great diſtreſs. Its little enemy had extricated itſelf ſo far, as to be able to bite it ſeverely in the throat; which preſently brought the eagle to the ground, and gave the Weaſel an opportunity of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0209200900:213"/>Notwithſtanding the wildneſs of this animal's nature, there are not wanting inſtances to prove, that it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being thoroughly tamed. M. Buffon, who aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the impoſſibility of bringing the Weaſel into any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſubjection, is afterwards corrected by a lady; who aſſures him, that ſhe had tried the experiment upon a young Weaſel taken in her garden; which ſoon learned to recognize and lick the hand from which it received its food, and became as familiar, careſſing, and frolicſome, as a Dog or a Squirrel.—The ſame author mentions ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experiment made by a gentleman, who trained a young Weaſel ſo completely, that the animal followed him wherever he went.—The method of taming them is to ſtroke them gently over the back; and to threaten, and even to beat them, when they bite.</p>
               <p>Theſe facts may ſerve to ſhew the poſſibility of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this animal domeſtic; and hold out a uſeful hint to us, that its ſervices might be very great in clearing ſhips, granaries, and other places, from the vermin with which they are frequently infeſted: For it is very well known, that one of theſe animals will kill more Rats and Mice than any Cat, being better able to purſue them into their holes and lurking-places.</p>
               <p>The odour of the Weaſel is very ſtrong, eſpecially in the ſummer time, or when it is irritated or purſued; it is then intolerable, and may be ſmelt at ſome diſtance.</p>
               <p>The following circumſtance, related by Buffon, will ſhew, that this animal has a natural attachment to every thing that is corrupt:—A Weaſel was taken in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, with three young ones, out of the carcaſe of a Wolf that had been hung on a tree by the hind feet. The Wolf was almoſt entirely putrefied; and the Weaſel
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0209200900:214"/>
had made a neſt of leaves and herbage for her young in the thorax of the putrid carcaſe.</p>

                  <figure/> THE STOAT.</head>
               <p>The difference in ſhape between this animal and the Weaſel is ſo ſmall, that they have frequently been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed under the ſame denomination; the ſmall Stoat being ſometimes miſtaken for a Weaſel.—The length of the former is about ten inches; the tail five inches and a half, very hairy; and tipt with black at the end; the edges of the ears, and the ends of the toes, are of a yellowiſh-white: In other reſpects, it perfectly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Weaſel in colour as well as form.</p>
               <p>In the moſt northern parts of Europe, this animal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly changes its colour in winter, and becomes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly white; except the end of the tail, which remains invariably black. It is then called the <hi>Ermine;</hi> and is much ſought after for its valuable fur, which makes a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0209200900:215"/>
conſiderable article of commerce in Norway, Lapland, Ruſſia, and other cold countries; where they are found in prodigious numbers. They are alſo very common in Kamtſchatka and Siberia, where they are taken in traps baited with fleſh. The ſkins are ſold in the country for from two to three pounds ſterling per hundred.—In Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they are either ſhot with blunt arrows, or taken in traps made of two flat ſtones, one being propped up with a ſtick, to which is faſtened a baited ſtring; and as ſoon as the animal begins to nibble, the ſtone falls down, and cruſhes it to death.—The Stoat is likewiſe found white in the winter time in Great-Britain, and is then erroneouſly called a <hi>White Weaſel.</hi> Its fur, however, among us, is of little value, having neither the thickneſs, the cloſeneſs, nor the whiteneſs, of thoſe which come from Siberia.</p>
               <p>One of theſe animals, that we had in our poſſeſſion, had entirely aſſumed its winter robe; but with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable mixture of yellow, eſpecially on the top of the head and back.—They begin to change from brown to white in November, and reſume their ſummer veſture in March.</p>
               <p>The natural hiſtory of this animal is much the ſame with that of the Weaſel; its food being young birds, rabbits, mice, &amp;c.; its agility the ſame; and its ſcent equally fetid.</p>

                  <figure/> THE FERRET.</head>
               <p>This animal is only known to us in a kind of domeſtic ſtate. It is originally a native of Africa; from whence, according to Strabo, it was brought into Spain; and, from its known enmity to the Rabbit, was made uſe of to reduce the numbers of them with which that kingdom abounded. It has ſince been employed for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in various parts of Europe; but as it is not able to bear the ſeverity of a cold climate, it cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great care and ſhelter. It is uſually kept in a box, with wool; of which it makes itſelf a warm bed. It ſleeps a great part of the day, and the moment it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes, ſeems eager for its food, which is commonly bread and milk.</p>
               <p>The Ferret breeds twice a year. The female goes ſix weeks with young. Some of them devour their offspring as ſoon as they are brought forth; when they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come in ſeaſon again, and have three litters, which generally conſiſt of five or ſix, but ſometimes ſeven or eight, and even nine.—It is apt to degenerate in this
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0209200900:217"/>
country, and loſe in ſome degree its ferocity. Warren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are therefore obliged to procure an intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the female and the Foumart. The produce is a breed of a much darker colour than the Ferret, partaking more of that of the Foumart.</p>
               <p>The length of this animal is about fourteen inches; that of the tail five; its noſe is ſharper than that of the Weaſel or the Foumart; its ears are round; and its eyes red and fiery: The colour of the whole body is a very pale-yellow.</p>
               <p>The Ferret is naturally ſuch an enemy to the Rabbit, that if a dead Rabbit be laid before a young Ferret, it inſtantly ſeizes upon it, although it has never ſeen one before. If a living Rabbit be preſented to it, the Ferret is ſtill more eager, ſeizes it by the neck, winds itſelf round it, and continues to ſuck its blood till it be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated.—When employed in the buſineſs of the warren, it muſt be muzzled, that it may not kill the Rabbits in their holes; but only oblige them to come out, that the warrener may catch them in his nets. If the Ferret be ſuffered to go in without a muzzle, or ſhould diſengage itſelf from it whilſt in the hole, there is great danger of loſing it; for after ſatisfying itſelf with blood, it falls aſleep, and it is then almoſt impoſſible to come at it.— The moſt uſual methods of recovering the Ferret are, by digging it out, or ſmoking the hole. If theſe do not ſucceed, it continues during the ſummer among the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit holes, and lives upon the prey it finds there; but being unable to endure the cold of the winter, is ſure to periſh.</p>
               <p>The Ferret, though eaſily tamed, is ſoon irritated.— Its odour is fetid; its nature voracious; it is tame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0209200900:218"/>
attachment; and ſuch is its appetite for blood, that it has been known to attack and kill children in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.—When angry, it is apt to bite; and the wound is difficult to cure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Madagaſcar Weaſel,</hi> or <hi>Vanſire</hi> of M. Buffon, may be referred to this ſpecies; to which its ſize and form are ſtrikingly ſimilar. It is about fourteen inches in length: The hair is of a dark-brown colour, mixed with black: It differs from the Ferret in the number of its grinding teeth, which amount to twelve; whereas, in the Ferret, there are but eight: The tail is longer than that of the Ferret, and better furniſhed with hair.</p>
               <p>The ſame author mentions another animal of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies under the name of the <hi>Nems,</hi> which is a native of Arabia. It reſembles our Ferret in every thing but the colour, which is that of a dark-brown mixed with white; the belly is of a bright-yellow colour, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the prevailing colour on the head and round the eyes is a clear yellow; on the noſe, cheeks, and other parts of the face where the hair is ſhort, a tincture of brown more or leſs prevails, and terminates gradually above the eyes; the legs are covered with ſhort hair, of a deep-yellow colour; on each foot there are four toes, and a ſmall one behind; the claws are ſmall and black; the tail, which is more than double the length of that of our Ferret, is very thick at its origin, terminates in a point, and is covered with long hair, ſimilar to that on the body.</p>

               <p>The length of this animal is about ſeventeen inches, excluſive of the tail, which is ſix inches long; the ears are ſhort, broad, and tipt with white on their edges; it is white about the mouth; the reſt of the body is for the moſt part of a deep-chocolate colour; the ſides are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with hairs of two colours, the ends being dark like the reſt of the body, and the middle of a full-tawny co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>The ſhape of this animal, like all others of this genus, is long and ſlender, the noſe ſharp-pointed, and the legs ſhort; the toes are long, and the claws ſharp.

               <p>It is a very active and nimble little animal, runs very
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0209200900:220"/>
faſt, and will creep up the ſides of walls with great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. In running, its belly ſeems to touch the ground; in preparing to jump, it arches its back, and makes its ſpring with great force.</p>
               <p>It is very deſtructive to poultry, pigeons, and young game of all kinds: It makes great havock amongſt Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; and its thirſt for blood is ſo great, that it kills ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than it can eat. One or two of theſe animals will almoſt deſtroy a whole warren.—It generally reſides in woods or thick brakes; where it burrows under ground, forming a ſhallow retreat about two yards in length, which commonly ends among the roots of trees.</p>
               <p>In the winter ſeaſon, this creature frequents houſes, barns, &amp;c. feeding on poultry, eggs, and ſometimes milk: But it has another mode of procuring ſubſiſtence, which has hitherto eſcaped the obſervation of the naturaliſt; and which, though ſingular, we can vouch for the truth of:—During a ſevere ſtorm, one of theſe animals was traced in the ſnow from the ſide of a rivulet to its hole, at ſome diſtance from it: As it was obſerved to have made frequent trips, and as other marks were to be ſeen in the ſnow which could not eaſily be accounted for, it was thought a matter worthy of more diligent enquiry: Its hole was accordingly examined, the Foumart taken, and eleven fine eels were diſcovered to be the fruits of this curious little animal's nocturnal excurſions. The marks in the ſnow were found to have been made by the motion of the eels in the creature's mouth.</p>
               <p>From the above curious circumſtance, we have given a repreſentation of this animal (which was drawn from the life) in poſſeſſion of this ſingular booty.—It may be matter of curious inveſtigation for ſome future naturaliſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0209200900:221"/>
to enquire by what arts this wily animal finds a booty ſo apparently difficult to attain: Whether by plunging in, and dragging it from its receſſes at the bottoms of rivers; or in the more ſecure method of taking advantage of the labours of others, and robbing the Otter of its ſtores.</p>
               <p>In attending to the inſtinctive faculties of animals, there is room for deep and diligent enquiry; and, though our progreſs is liable to many interruptions, it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful taſk to follow the workings of Nature through all her intricate and curious windings: Every ſtep we gain is a ſufficient reward for our trouble, and leads us to admire the wiſdom and goodneſs of that Diſpenſation which furniſhes every creature with ſufficient and ample powers to adminiſter to all its wants, neceſſities, and comforts.</p>
               <p>The female Foumart brings forth in the ſummer, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally five or ſix at a time. She ſuckles them but a ſhort time, and accuſtoms them early to live upon blood and eggs.</p>
               <p>Though the ſmell of this animal is rank and diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even to a proverb, yet the ſkin is dreſt with the hair on, and uſed as other furs, without retaining its offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive odour.</p>
               <p>The Foumart is a very fierce and bold little creature: When attacked by a Dog, it will defend itſelf with great ſpirit, attack in its turn, and faſten upon the noſe of its enemy with ſo keen a bite, as frequently to oblige him to deſiſt.</p>

               <p>inhabits the North of Europe, Aſia, and America: It is likewiſe found in Great-Britain, but is not numerous there.—It lives chiefly in large foreſts; eſpecially where the pine tree abounds, of the tops of which it is very fond.</p>
               <p>North-America abounds with theſe animals. Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious numbers of their ſkins are annually imported from thence. Above thirty thouſand ſkins have been brought over from Canada in one year, and from Hudſon's Bay nearly fifteen thouſand in the ſame time.</p>
               <p>The principal difference between the Pine Weaſel and the Martin is in the colour. The breaſt of the former is yellow; the colour of the body much darker; and the fur, in general, greatly ſuperior in fineneſs, beauty, and value.</p>

               <head>THE MARTIN</head>
               <p>is much more common in this country than the Pine Weaſel.—It lives wholly in woods, and breeds in the hollows of trees. It produces from four to ſix young ones at a time.</p>
               <p>This animal is the moſt beautiful of all the Weaſel kind. Its head is ſmall, and elegantly formed; its eyes are lively; and its motions quick and graceful—When taken young, it is eaſily tamed, extremely playful, and good-humoured. Its attachment, however, is not to be depended upon. It readily takes advantage of the firſt opportunity to regain its liberty, and retire to the woods, its natural haunts.</p>
               <p>The food of the Martin is much the ſame with other animals of its kind. It makes inceſſant war with Rats, Mice, and other vermin: Poultry, game, and ſmall birds, are its conſtant prey: It feeds alſo on grain, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of honey.</p>
               <p>M. Buffon tells us of one of theſe animals that he had tamed, which, he remarks, drank frequently. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſlept two days ſucceſſively, and at other times would continue awake as long. In preparing itſelf for ſleep, it folded itſelf up in a round form, and covered its head with its tail. When awake, its motions were ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, ſo conſtant, and ſo troubleſome, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep it chained. From the flexibility of its body, it eaſily eluded its fetters; and, after returning once or twice, at laſt abſented itſelf entirely.</p>
               <p>The Martin is about eighteen inches long; the tail is te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and full of hair, eſpecially towards the end, which is thick and buſhy; the ears are broad, rounded, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0209200900:224"/>
open; the body is covered with a thick fur, of a dark-brown colour; the head is brown, mixed with red; the throat and breaſt are white; the belly is of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with the back, but a little paler; the feet are broad, and covered on the under ſide with a thick fur; the claws white, large, and ſharp, well adapted for climbing trees, which in this country are its conſtant reſidence.</p>
               <p>The ſkin and excrements of this animal have an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able muſky ſcent, and are entirely free from that rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is ſo diſguſting in other animals of this kind. Its fur is valuable, and in high eſtimation.</p>

                  <figure/> THE SABLE.</head>
               <p>This little animal, ſo highly eſteemed for its ſkin, is a native of the ſnowy regions of the North, being found chiefly in Siberia, Kamtſchatka, and ſome of the iſlands which lie between that country and Japan; and a few are alſo found in Lapland.</p>
               <p>The darkeſt furs are the moſt valuable. A ſingle ſkin, though not above four inches broad, is ſometimes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as high as fifteen pounds. The ſable differs from all other furs in this, that the hair turns with equal eaſe to either ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0209200900:225"/>The Sable reſembles the Martin in form, and is about the ſame ſize.—It lives in holes in the earth, by the banks of rivers, and under the roots of trees. It makes its neſt of moſs, ſmall twigs, and graſs.—The female brings forth in the ſpring, and produces from three to five at one time.—Sometimes, like the Martin, it forms its neſt in the hollow of a tree.</p>
               <p>This animal is very lively and active, and will leap with great agility from tree to tree, in purſuit of ſmall birds, woodcocks, ſquirrels, &amp;c. It likewiſe lives upon rats, fiſhes, pine tops, and wild fruits.</p>
               <p>It is affirmed by naturaliſts, that the Sable is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the water; and, from the fineneſs and cloſeneſs of its fur, there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe that it is much accuſtomed to that element; from which it alſo derives a part of its ſubſiſtence: And as a farther proof that this animal is in ſome degree amphibious, we are told by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers <note n="*" place="bottom">Avril's Travels, p. 140.</note>, that it is very numerous in ſmall iſlands, where the hunters go in queſt of them.—It is mentioned by Ariſtotle as a water animal, and is deſcribed by him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Satherius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The hunting of the Sables is chiefly carried on by cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals confined to the deſert regions of Siberia, or by ſoldiers ſent thither for that purpoſe, who generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there ſeveral years. Both are obliged to furniſh a certain quantity of furs. They ſhoot with a ſingle ball, to injure the ſkin as little as poſſible. They frequently take them in traps, or kill them with blunt arrows.—As an encouragement to the hunters, they are allowed to ſhare among themſelves whatever ſkins they take above
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0209200900:226"/>
the allotted number; and this, in a few years, amounts to a conſiderable premium.—The hunters form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſmall troops, each of which is directed by a leader of their own chuſing.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon of hunting is from November to February; for at that time the Sables are in the higheſt perfection: Thoſe caught at any other time of the year are full of ſhort hairs, and are ſold at inferior prices. The beſt ſkins are ſuch as have only long hair, which is always black, and of a gloſſy brightneſs. Old furs do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their gloſs.—Both the Ruſſians and Chineſe have a method of dying their furs; but the dyed ſables are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered, having neither the ſmoothneſs nor the brightneſs of the natural hair.</p>
               <p>The bellies of Sables, which are ſold in pairs, are about two fingers in breadth, and are tied together in bundles of forty pieces, which are ſold at from one to two pounds ſterling. The tails are ſold by the hundred, from four to eight pounds.</p>
               <p>There are inſtances of Sables being found of a ſnowy whiteneſs; but they are rare, and bought only as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities.</p>
               <p>The hunters of this animal are frequently obliged to endure the utmoſt extremity of cold and hunger in the purſuit of their booty. They penetrate deep into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe woods, where they have no other method of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their way back but by marking the trees as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: If this ſhould by any means fail them, they are inevitably loſt. They ſometimes trace the Sables on the new-fallen ſnow to their holes, place their nets at the entrance, and wait frequently two or three days before the animal comes out.—It has happened, by the failure
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0209200900:227"/>
of their proviſions, that theſe poor wretches have been reduced to the neceſſity of tying thin boards tight to their ſtomachs to prevent the cravings of appetite—Such are the hardſhips our fellow-creatures undergo to ſupply the wants of the vain and luxuriant!</p>
               <p>An animal, ſimilar to the Sable, is mentioned by Mr Pennant under the name of the <hi>Fiſher.</hi> It is found in North-America; and, by the number of its ſkins im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, muſt be very numerous there, nearly ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them having been brought in one ſeaſon from New-York and Penſylvania. The hair on the body is moſtly black; the ſides brown; the ears are broad and round, duſky on their outſides, and edged with white; the face and ſides of the neck pale-brown, mixed with black; the feet are very broad, and covered with hair, even on their ſoles; the tail is full and buſhy; the length of the animal, from noſe to tail, is twenty-eight inches; the tail ſeventeen.</p>

               <p>This animal, in Egypt, is domeſtic, like the Cat; and is retained by the natives for the ſame uſeful purpoſes of clearing their houſes of Rats and Mice.—With all the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0209200900:228"/>
ſtrength and agility of the Cat, it has a more general appetite for carnage. It attacks, without dread, the moſt deadly ſerpents, and preys on every noxious rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile of the torrid zone, which it ſeizes and kills with great avidity.—It is ſaid, that when this animal is wounded by a ſerpent, and begins to feel the effect of the poiſon, it immediately has recourſe to a certain root, which the Indians call after its name, and aſſert that it is an antidote for the bite of any venomous reptile.</p>
               <p>The Ichneumon is the moſt formidable enemy of the crocodile: It deſtroys its eggs, which it digs out of the ſand, where they are laid to hatch by the heat of the ſun; and kills great numbers of the young crocodiles ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their production, before they are able to reach the water. It was for this reaſon that the ancient Egyptians worſhipped this animal, and ranked the Ichneumon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe deities that were moſt propitious to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals, in their domeſtic ſtate, are perfectly tame and gentle. M. d'Obſonville ſpeaks of one which he reared from a young one. It became tamer than a Cat, was obedient to the call of its maſter, and followed him wherever he went. One day he brought a ſmall water-ſerpent alive, being deſirous to know how far its inſtinct would carry it againſt a being with whom it was hitherto entirely unacquainted. Its firſt emotion ſeemed to be aſtoniſhment mixed with anger: Its hair became erect: In an inſtant, it ſlipped behind the reptile; and, with remarkable ſwiftneſs and agility, leaped upon its head, ſeized it, and cruſhed it with its teeth. This firſt eſſay ſeemed to have awakened in it its natural appetite for blood, which till then had given way to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its education: It no longer ſuffered the poultry,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0209200900:229"/>
among which it was brought up, to paſs unregarded; but took the firſt opportunity, when it was alone, to ſtrangle them. It eat a part of their fleſh, and drank only the blood of others.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are numerous in all the ſouthern regions of Aſia, from Egypt to the iſland of Java: They are alſo found in Africa, in the country about the Cape of Good Hope. They frequent the banks of rivers, are fond of fiſh, are ſaid to take the water like an Otter, and will continue in it a conſiderable time without riſing to take breath.</p>
               <p>The Ichneumon varies in ſize. The domeſtic kind is generally larger than thoſe that are wild, and its colours more variegated. It is in general about the ſize of a common Cat; ſomewhat longer in the body, and ſhorter in the legs. Its fur contains tints of white, brown, fawn-colour, and a dirty ſilver-grey, which all together form a mixture very agreeable to the eye.—Its form is like that of the Polecat. Its eyes are ſmall, but inflamed, and ſparkle with a ſingular vivacity; its noſe is long and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; its ears ſmall, rounded, and almoſt naked; its tail is very thick at the baſe, and tapers to a point; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the tail is an orifice, from which a moſt fetid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is ſecreted; its claws are long.—It darts upon its prey like an arrow, and ſeizes it with inevitable certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>This creature has a ſmall ſoft voice, ſomewhat like a murmur; and, unleſs ſtruck or irritated, never exerts it. When it ſleeps, it folds itſelf up like a ball, and is not eaſily awaked. It frequently ſits up like a Squirrel, and feeds itſelf with its fore feet; catches any thing that is thrown to it; and will often feign itſelf dead till its prey come within its reach.</p>

               <p>is rather ſmaller than the Martin. Its body is ſlender, and covered with hair of an aſh colour mixed with taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the ſides of the face are black; at the hind part of the head there are four black lines, extending from thence toward the back and ſhoulders; the tail is long, and annulated with black; its eye is full, round, and black, which gives it a wild and miſchievous aſpect.</p>
               <p>This animal inhabits the iſland of Madagaſcar, Guinea, Cochinchina, and the Philippine Iſles. It feeds on fleſh and fruits, but prefers the latter, and is peculiarly fond of bananas. It is a very fierce animal, and not eaſily tamed.—In Guinea, it is called the <hi>Berbe,</hi> and by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans the <hi>Wine-bibber,</hi> being very greedy of palm wine. —When young, its fleſh is reckoned very good to eat.</p>

               <p>This animal, which is called the <hi>Chinche</hi> by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Brazil, is about the ſize of a common Cat. Its noſe is long and ſlender, and extends a conſiderable way beyond the lower jaw; its ears are large, ſhort, and rounded; a white ſtripe extends from the noſe over the forehead and along the back, where it is interſected with a ſmall line of black, commencing at the tail, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upwards along the middle of the back; its belly and legs are black; its hair is long, eſpecially on the tail, which is thick and buſhy.</p>
               <p>This creature inhabits Peru and other parts of South-America, and is remarkable above all the Weaſel kind for a moſt intolerable, ſuffocating, fetid vapour, which it emits from behind, when attacked, purſued, or frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſtench of this effluvia is inſupportable, and is the creature's beſt means of defence.</p>
               <p>There are three or four varieties of this animal, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by M. Buffon under the name of the <hi>Stinking Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats;</hi> all of which poſſeſs this wonderful faculty of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying their enemies from the ſame quarter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0209200900:232"/>Some turn their tail to their purſuers, and emit a moſt horrible ſtench, which keeps both dogs and men at a conſiderable diſtance: Others eject their urine to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about eighteen feet; and it is of ſo virulent a quality, as almoſt to occaſion blindneſs, if any of it ſhould happen to fall into the eyes. Clothes infected with it, retain the ſmell for many days: No waſhing can make them ſweet; but they muſt be even buried in freſh ſoil before they can be thoroughly cleanſed. Dogs that are not properly bred, turn back as ſoon as they perceive the ſmell: Thoſe that have been accuſtomed to it, will kill the animal; but are obliged to relieve themſelves by thruſting their noſes into the ground.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stifling,</hi> or <hi>Squaſh,</hi> which is the ſecond variety of this animal, is nearly of the ſame ſize with the Skunk. Its hair is long, and of a deep-brown colour. It lives in holes and clefts of rocks, where the female brings forth her young. It is a native of Mexico; and feeds on bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, worms, and ſmall birds. It deſtroys poultry, of which it only eats the brains.—When afraid or irritated, it voids the ſame offenſive kind of odour, which no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dare venture to approach. Profeſſor Kalm was in danger of being ſuffocated by one that was purſued into a houſe where he ſlept; and it affected the cattle ſo much, that they bellowed through pain. Another, which was killed by a maid ſervant in a cellar, ſo affected her with its ſtench, that ſhe lay ill for ſeveral days; all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that were in the place were ſo tainted by the ſmell, as to be utterly unfit for uſe.</p>
               <p>Another variety of this animal is called the <hi>Conepate;</hi> and is, perhaps, no more than the female of the laſt-mentioned animal It is ſomewhat ſmaller, and differs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0209200900:233"/>
chiefly from the Squaſh in being marked with five pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel white lines, which run along its back and ſides from head to tail. It is a native of North-America.— When attacked, it briſtles up its hair, throws itſelf into a round form, and emits an odour which no creature can ſupport.</p>
               <p>The laſt of this peſtiferous family which we ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the <hi>Zorilla.</hi> This animal is a native of New-Spain, where it is called the <hi>Mariputa.</hi> It is found on the banks of the river Oronoque; and is, perhaps, the moſt beautiful, and at the ſame time the moſt offenſive, of all creatures. Its body is beautifully marked with white ſtripes upon a black ground, running from the head to the middle of the back; from whence they are croſſed with other white bands, which cover the lower part of the back and flanks: Its tail is long and buſhy, black as far as the middle, and white to its extremity. It is an active and miſchievous little animal. Its ſtench is ſaid to extend to a conſiderable diſtance; and is ſo powerful, as to overcome even the Panther of America, which is one of its greateſt enemies.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this offenſive quality in theſe animals, they are frequently tamed, and will follow their maſter like domeſtic animals. They do not emit their odour, unleſs when beaten or irritated. They are frequently killed by the native Indians, who immediately cut away the noxious glands; thereby preventing the fleſh, which is good eating, from being infected. Its taſte is ſaid nearly to reſemble the flavour of that of a young pig. The ſavage Indians make purſes of their ſkins, which are held in no eſtimation by the Europeans.</p>

               <p>The body of the Genet is longer than that of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; its head is long and ſlender, with a ſharp muzzle; its ears are a little pointed; its hair ſoft, ſmooth, and ſhining, of a tawny-red colour, ſpotted with black; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ridge of the back there is a kind of mane of long hair, which forms a black line from head to tail; the ſpots on the ſides are round and diſtinct, thoſe on the back almoſt cloſe; its tail is long, and marked with ſeven or eight rings of black. From an orifice beneath its tail, it yields a kind of perfume which ſmells faintly of muſk.</p>
               <p>This creature is found in Turkey, Syria, and Spain. We are told by Belon, that he ſaw Genets in the houſes at Conſtantinople as tame as Cats; and that they were uſeful to the inhabitants in deſtroying rats, mice, and other vermin.</p>
               <p>It is a moſt beautiful, cleanly, and induſtrious animal, and very active in purſuing its prey. Its nature is mild and gentle; its colours beautifully variegated; and its

                  <figure/> THE CIVET</head>
               <p>is larger than the Genet, and yields a perfume in much greater quantities, and of a ſtronger quality.</p>
               <p>Though originally a native of the warm climates of Africa or Aſia, this creature can live in temperate, and even in cold countries; but it muſt be fed with nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diet, and carefully defended againſt the ſeverities of the weather. Numbers of them are kept in Holland for the purpoſe of collecting this valuable perfume. The ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet procured at Amſterdam is more eſteemed than that which comes from the Levant or India, being leſs adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated. To collect this perfume, the animal is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a cage, ſo narrow that it cannot turn itſelf: The cage is opened at one end, and the animal drawn backwards by the tail, and ſecurely held by its hind legs: A ſmall ſpoon is then introduced into the pouch which contains the perfume, with which it is carefully ſcraped, and the matter put into a veſſel properly ſecured. This operation
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0209200900:236"/>
is performed two or three times a week.—The quantity of odorous humour depends much on the quality of the nouriſhment, and the appetite of the animal, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produces more in proportion to the goodneſs of its food. Boiled fleſh, eggs, rice, ſmall animals, birds, and particularly fiſh, are the kinds of food the Civet moſtly delights in; and theſe ought to be varied, ſo as to excite its appetite, and preſerve its health.—It requires very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water; and, though it drinks ſeldom, it diſcharges its urine frequently. It is ſomewhat remarkable, that in this operation the male is not to be diſtinguiſhed from the female.—From this circumſtance, it has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that this animal was the <hi>Hyena</hi> of the ancients; and it is certain, that moſt of the fables related concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that monſter are in a certain way applicable to the Civet.—The ancients were well acquainted with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum of the Civet, and aſcribed to it certain powers of exciting love; for which purpoſe it ſtill conſtitutes one of the luxuries of the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>What has been fabulouſly related concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of ſex in the Hyena, applies much more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Civet; for in the male nothing appears exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally but three apertures, ſo perfectly ſimilar to thoſe of the female, that it is impoſſible to diſtinguiſh the ſex otherwiſe than by diſſection.</p>
               <p>The perfume of this animal is ſo ſtrong, that it infects every part of its body: The hair and the ſkin are ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly penetrated with it, that they retain it long after being taken from the body of the animal. If a perſon be ſhut up in the ſame apartment, it is almoſt inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and when heated with rage, it becomes ſtill more pungent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0209200900:237"/>The Civet is naturally ſavage, and ſomewhat fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; yet it is eaſily tamed, ſo as to be handled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger.</p>
               <p>The teeth of this creature are ſtrong and ſharp; but its claws are weak. It is an active and nimble animal. It leaps like a Cat, and runs with great ſwiftneſs. It lives by hunting; ſurprizes ſmall animals and birds; and, like the Weaſel, will ſometimes ſteal into the yard, and carry off poultry.—Its eyes ſhine in the dark; and it is probable, that it can ſee well enough to purſue its prey during the night, as it is known to be moſt active at that time.</p>
               <p>The Civet is very prolific in its native climate; but, though it lives and produces its perfume in temperate regions, it is never known to breed there.—Its voice is ſtronger than that of the Cat, and has ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the cry of an enraged Dog.</p>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0209200900:238"/>
from each other by ſuch diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics, as entitle them to be regarded as two diſtinct ſpecies. The ears of the Zibet are larger and more erect; and its muzzle is thinner and flatter: Its body is longer than that of the Civet; and its tail, which is longer, is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with annular ſpots, like that of the Genet: It has no mane or long hair on the neck and ſpine; and its hair is ſhorter and ſofter.</p>
               <p>The perfume of the Zibet is peculiarly violent and piercing, beyond that of either the Civet or the Genet. —This odorous liquor is found in a fiſſure near the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of generation. It is a thick humour, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of pomatum; and, though very ſtrong, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable even as it iſſues from the body of the animal.— This matter of the Zibet muſt not be confounded with muſk, which is a ſanguineous humour, derived from a ſpecies of the Roe-buck, or Goat without Horns<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 88.</note>; and has nothing in common with the Zibet but its ſtrong perfume.</p>

                  <figure/> THE SURICATE, OR FOUR-TOED WEASEL,</head>
               <p>is an active and dexterous little animal. It is rather leſs than a Rabbit, and pretty much reſembles the Ichneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both in ſize and in the colour of its hair, only it is rougher, and its tail is not quite ſo long. Its upper jaw is much longer than the lower, and very pliant and moveable. It has only four toes on each foot, in which it differs from all the Weaſel kind.</p>
               <p>One of theſe animals, in the poſſeſſion of M. de Seve, was obſerved ſometimes to walk on its hind legs, and frequently to ſit upright, with its fore feet hanging down on its breaſt.</p>
               <p>The Suricate is carnivorous, and preys on ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. It is fond of fiſh, and ſtill more ſo of eggs. Like the Squirrel, it makes uſe of its fore paws to convey its victuals to its mouth. In drinking, it laps like a Dog; but will not drink water, except when it is warm. The ordinary drink of that kept by De Seve was its own urine, though it had a very ſtrong odour. It frolicked with the Cats, and always innocently. It was extremely playful and familiar, knew its own name, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at a call. What was remarkable, it ſeemed to have an averſion to particular perſons, whom it would always
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0209200900:240"/>
bite on their approaching it: Some people were ſo diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it, that even when reſtrained, it would make uſe of ſeveral artifices to come near enough to bite them; and when it could not lay hold of their legs, would fly at their ſhoes or petticoats. When diſcontented, it made a noiſe like the barking of a whelp; and when pleaſed or careſſed, would utter a ſound like the ſhaking of a rattle.</p>

               <p>deſcribed by Mr Pennant under the name of the <hi>Fizzler,</hi> is a native of the Cape of Good Hope.—It lives chiefly upon honey, and is endowed with a wonderful faculty of diſcovering the ſecret retreats where the bees depoſit their ſtores. About ſun-ſet, the Ratel is particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive in watching the motions of theſe induſtrious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects; and having obſerved their route, it follows with great care the direction in which they fly. It is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſiſted in diſcovering its delicious booty by a bird called the Honey Guide, <hi>(cuculus indicator)</hi> which is extremely fond both of honey and the eggs of bees; and in the purſuit of its food, excites the attention of the Ratel by a loud grating cry of <hi>cherr, cherr, cherr;</hi> at
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0209200900:241"/>
the ſame time flying ſlowly on towards the place where the ſwarm of bees have taken up their abode. The Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel follows the ſound with great attention; and having plundered the neſt, leaves ſufficient behind it as a reward for the ſervices of its faithful guide. The Ratel is well adapted to this purpoſe, as the toughneſs and thickneſs of its ſkin effectually defends it from the ſtings of the bees: On this account it is extremely difficult to kill this animal; for its ſkin is ſo looſely attached to its body, that when ſeized by a hound it gives way, and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal has an opportunity of turning round, and biting its affailant, which it frequently does ſo ſeverely, as to oblige him to deſiſt.</p>
               <p>The Ratel, according to Mr Pennant, is two feet long from the noſe to the tail, which is eight inches; its legs are ſhort; on each foot it has four toes, armed with long claws; thoſe on the fore feet are above an inch long, and very ſharp; its tongue is rough; it has no ear-laps; the orifice of the ear is wide, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a callous rim; a broad ſtripe, of an aſh colour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends along the back from the forehead to the tail, which is ſeparated from the black hair on the ſides and belly by a light grey liſt running from behind each ear to the tail. —It burrows in holes under ground, is ſaid to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fetid, and is called the <hi>Stinking Badger</hi> by M. de la Caille.</p>

                  <figure/> THE COATI, OR BRAZILIAN WEASEL.</head>
               <p>This animal has ſome reſemblance to the Bear, in the length of its hind legs, in the form of its feet, in the buſhineſs of its hair, and in the ſtructure of its paws; but it is ſmall, and its tail is long, and variegated with different colours. Its upper jaw is much longer than the lower, and very pliant; its ears are rounded; its hair is ſmooth, ſoft, and gloſſy, of a bright-bay colour; and its breaſt is whitiſh.</p>
               <p>Linnaeus deſcribes one of theſe animals, which he kept a conſiderable time, and in vain attempted to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjection. It was ſo obſtinate, that it would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to which it was diſinclined. It killed the poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, tore off their heads, and ſucked their blood. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended itſelf with great force whenever any perſon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to lay hold of it contrary to its inclination; and it ſtuck faſt to the legs of thoſe with whom it was fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, when it wanted to ranſack their pockets, and carry off any thing that it found in them. It had an extreme averſion to hog's briſtles; and the ſmalleſt bruſh made it deſiſt.—Its mode of living was very ſingular: It ſlept
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0209200900:243"/>
from midnight till noon, kept awake the reſt of the day, and uniformly walked about from ſix in the evening till midnight, without the leaſt regard to the weather. This is probably the time aſſigned by Nature to this ſpecies of animals for procuring their food, which conſiſts chiefly of young birds, eggs, and ſmall animals.</p>
               <p>This creature inhabits Brazil and Guiana, runs up trees very nimbly, eats like a Dog, and holds its food between its fore legs like the Bear. The Coati ſtands with eaſe on its hind feet. It is ſaid to gnaw its own tail, which it generally carries erect, and ſweeps it about from ſide to ſide.</p>

                  <figure/> THE RACOON</head>
               <p>is very common in the warm regions of America: It is found alſo in the mountains of Jamaica; from whence great numbers of them frequently deſcend into the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and make great havock among the ſugar-canes, of which they are particularly fond. The planters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe animals as their greateſt enemies, as they frequently do infinite miſchief in one night's excurſion.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0209200900:244"/>
They have contrived various methods of deſtroying them; yet ſtill they propagate in ſuch numbers, that neither traps nor fire-arms can repel them.</p>
               <p>The Racoon is ſomewhat leſs than the Badger: Its head reſembles that of a Fox; but its ears are round, and much ſhorter; and its upper jaw very pointed, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the lower: Its eyes, which are large, are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with two broad patches of black; its body is thick and ſhort, covered with long hair, black at the points, and grey underneath; its tail is long and buſhy, and marked with alternate rings of black and white; its feet and toes are black.</p>
               <p>The Racoon is a very active and nimble animal. Its claws, which are extremely ſharp, enable it to climb trees with great facility. It moves forward chiefly by bounding; and, though it proceeds in an oblique direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, runs with great ſwiftneſs.—When tamed, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good-natured and ſportive; but it is almoſt conſtantly in motion, and as unlucky and inquiſitive as a Monkey, examining every thing with its paws, which it makes uſe of as hands to lay hold of any thing that is given it, and to carry its meat to its mouth. It ſits up to eat, is extremely fond of ſweet things and ſtrong liquors, with which it will get exceſſively drunk. It has all the cunning of the Fox, is very deſtructive to poultry; but will eat all ſorts of fruits, grain, and roots. It has a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar method of dipping every thing in water it intends to eat, and will ſeldom taſte bread till it be well ſoaked. It opens oyſters with aſtoniſhing dexterity, ſeparates the ſhells, and leaves not a veſtige of the fiſh. It does this without looking at the oyſter; but places it under its hind paws, and with its ſore feet ſearches for the weakeſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0209200900:245"/>
part, where it fixes its claws, forces it open, and ſnatches out the fiſh. It likewiſe devours all kinds of inſects; delights in hunting ſpiders; and when at liberty in a garden, will eat graſshoppers, ſnails, worms, &amp;c. It is a very cleanly animal, and always retires to obey the calls of Nature. It is familiar, and even careſſing, leaps upon thoſe it is fond of, plays ſportively, and moves about with great agility.</p>
               <p>This animal is hunted for its ſkin, which is next in value to that of the Beaver for making hats.</p>

                  <figure/> THE BADGER.</head>
               <p>Although Nature has furniſhed this animal with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable weapons of offence, and has beſides given it ſtrength ſufficient to uſe them with great effect, it is, notwithſtanding, a harmleſs and inoffenſive creature; and, unleſs attacked, employs them only for its ſupport and comfort.</p>
               <p>This animal retires to the moſt ſecret receſſes; where it digs its hole, and forms its habitation under ground.— Its food conſiſts chiefly of roots, fruits, graſs, inſects, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0209200900:246"/>
frogs. It is charged with deſtroying lambs and rabbits; but there ſeems to be no other reaſon to conſider it as a beaſt of prey, than the analogy between its teeth and thoſe of carnivorous animals.</p>
               <p>Few creatures defend themſelves better, or bite with greater keenneſs, than the Badger. On that account it is frequently baited with Dogs trained for that purpoſe. This inhuman diverſion is chiefly confined to the indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and the vicious, who take a cruel pleaſure in ſeeing this harmleſs animal ſurrounded by its enemies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending itſelf from their attacks, which it does with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing agility and ſucceſs. Its motions are ſo quick, that a Dog is frequently deſperately wounded in the firſt moment of aſſault, and obliged to fly. The thickneſs of the Badger's ſkin, and the length and coarſeneſs of its hair, are an excellent defence againſt the bites of the Dogs: Its ſkin is ſo looſe, as to reſiſt the impreſſions of their teeth; and give the animal an opportunity of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf round, and wounding its adverſaries in their tendereſt parts. In this manner this ſingular creature is able to reſiſt repeated attacks both of men and dogs, from all quarters, till, being overpowered with numbers, and enfeebled by many deſperate wounds, it is at laſt obliged to ſubmit.</p>
               <p>The Badger is an indolent animal, and ſleeps much; it confines itſelf to its hole during the whole day, and feeds only in the night; it is ſo cleanly, as never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file its habitation with its ordure; it breeds only once in a year, and brings forth four or five at a time.</p>
               <p>This animal is not known to exiſt in warm countries. It is an original native of the temperate climates of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; and is found without any variety in Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Poland, and Sweden.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0209200900:247"/>The uſual length of the Badger is ſomewhat above two feet, excluſive of the tail, which is about ſix inches long; its eyes are ſmall, and are placed in a black ſtripe, which begins behind the ears, and runs tapering toward the noſe; the throat and legs are black; the back, ſides, and tail, are of a dirty-grey, mixed with black; the legs and feet are very ſhort, ſtrong, and thick; each foot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of five toes; thoſe on the fore feet are armed with ſtrong claws, well adapted for digging its ſubterranean habitations.</p>
               <p>In walking, the Badger treads on its whole heel, like the Bear; which brings its belly very near the ground.</p>
               <p>Immediately below the tail, between that and the anus, there is a narrow tranſverſe orifice, from whence a white ſubſtance, of a very fetid ſmell, conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udes.</p>
               <p>The ſkin of this creature, when dreſſed with the hair on, is uſed for piſtol furniture.—Its fleſh is eaten; the hind quarters are ſometimes made into hams, which, when cured, are not inferior in goodneſs to the beſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.—The hairs are made into bruſhes, which are uſed by painters to ſoften and harmonize their ſhades. They are called ſweetening tools.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This creature has been variouſly deſcribed by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts. We have ſelected the account given by M. Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, which was taken from a living animal in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. Its length, from the noſe to the inſertion of the tail, was two feet two inches; the tail was eight inches long; the length of the fore legs was eleven inches, and the hind one foot; it had five toes on each foot, armed with long ſharp claws; the middle claw of the fore foot was one inch and a half long; the muzzle, as far as the eye-brows, was black; its eyes were ſmall and black, and its ears ſhort; its breaſt and under jaw were ſpotted with white; the back, legs, belly, and tail, were black.—Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its confinement, this animal did not diſcover any ſymptoms of great ferocity. It eat voraciouſly; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a full meal, covered itſelf in its cage with ſtraw. It eat no bread; but would devour more than four pounds
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0209200900:250"/>
of fleſh every day, which it ſwallowed greedily, almoſt without chewing.</p>
               <p>In a ſtate of liberty, this creature is ſaid to lead a life of continual rapine. It lurks in the branches of trees, in order to ſurprize Deer and other animals that paſs under them. It waits with great patience the arrival of its prey, and darts from its hiding-place with unerring cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. In this manner it indiſcriminately ſurprizes the Horſe, the Elk, the Stag, or the Rein-deer; and fixes itſelf between their ſhoulders with its teeth and claws.— The wild Rein-deer, which are numerous both in Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and North-America, frequently fall victims to the Glutton. When ſeized by this blood-thirſty animal, it is in vain that the wounded Deer endeavours to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage itſelf from its enemy by ruſtling among the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the trees: No force can oblige it to quit its hold: It maintains its poſition, and continues to ſuck the blood of the flying animal till it falls down exhauſted with pain and fatigue: It then devours the carcaſe with inſatiable voracity, and gorges itſelf with the fleſh till it is almoſt in danger of burſting.</p>
               <p>The motions of the Glutton are ſlow. There are few quadrupeds that cannot eſcape from it, except the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which it frequently purſues and overtakes.—In America, it is called the <hi>Beaver-eater.</hi>—It ſometimes lies in wait, and ſurprizes thoſe animals coming out of their burrow; or breaks into their habitation, and kills great numbers of them.</p>
               <p>The Glutton often defeats the labours of the huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by ſtealing away the Sables and other animals that have been caught in their traps; and it is ſometimes taken in the ſnares laid for theſe animals. When attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0209200900:251"/>
it makes a ſtrong reſiſtance: It will tear the ſtock from the gun, if it ſhould catch hold of it with its teeth; or break the trap in pieces in which it is caught. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its fierceneſs, it is capable of being tamed, and of learning ſeveral entertaining tricks.—It is hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for its ſkin, which is very valuable, of a moſt beautiful gloſſy black, which ſhines with a peculiar luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and reflects the light like damaſk ſilk.—The ſkins are ſold in Siberia at five or ſix ſhillings each, at Jakutſk at twelve, and ſtill dearer in Kamtſchatka; where the women dreſs their hair with its white paws, which they eſteem a great ornament.—The furs of this animal, from the North of Europe and Aſia, are infinitely finer, blacker, and more gloſſy, than thoſe of the American kind.</p>

               <p>THERE are two kinds of this animal,—the <hi>Land</hi> and the <hi>Sea Bear.</hi> Theſe are very different, as well in the formation of their bodies, as in their habits and diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>There are two varieties of the land Bear,—the <hi>Brown</hi> and the <hi>Black.</hi> The former is found in almoſt every cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the black Bear chiefly in the foreſts of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern regions of Europe and America.</p>
               <p>The brown Bear is ſometimes carnivorous, and will deſtroy cattle, and eat carrion; but its general food is roots, fruits, and vegetables.—It is a ſavage and ſolitary animal, lives in deſert and unfrequented places, and chuſes its den in the moſt gloomy and retired parts of the foreſt, or in the moſt dangerous and inacceſſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices of unfrequented mountains. It retires alone to its den about the end of autumn, (at which time it is exceedingly fat) and lives for ſeveral weeks in a ſtate of total inactivity and abſtinence from food.—During this time, the female brings forth her young, and ſuckles
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0209200900:253"/>
them. She chuſes her retreat for that purpoſe in the moſt retired places, apart from the male, leſt he ſhould devour them. She makes a warm bed for her young, and attends them with unremitting care during four months; and in all that time, ſhe ſcarcely allows her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any nouriſhment. She brings forth two, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three young at a time.—The cubs are round and ſhapeleſs, with pointed muzzles; but they are not lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into form by the female, as Pliny and other ancient naturaliſts ſuppoſed. At firſt they do not exceed eight inches in length; they are blind during the firſt four weeks, are of a pale-yellow colour, and have ſcarcely any reſemblance of the creature when arrived at matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.—The time of geſtation in theſe animals is about ſix months; and they bring forth in the beginning of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>
               <p>In the ſpring, the old Bears, attended by their young, come out from their retreats, lean, and almoſt famiſhed by their long confinement. They then ranſack every quarter in ſearch of food. They frequently climb trees, and devour the fruit in great quantities; particularly the date-plumb tree, of which they are exceedingly fond. They aſcend theſe trees with ſurprizing agility, keep themſelves firm on the branches with one paw, and with the other collect the fruit.</p>
               <p>The Bear is remarkably fond of honey, which it will encounter great difficulties to obtain, and ſeeks for with great cunning and avidity.</p>
               <p>This animal enjoys, in a ſuperior degree, the ſenſes of hearing, ſmelling, and touching.—Its ears are ſhort and rounded; and its eyes ſmall, but lively and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, and defended by a nictating membrane: From
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0209200900:254"/>
the peculiar formation of the internal parts of its noſe, its ſenſe of ſmelling is exceedingly exquiſite: The legs and thighs are ſtrong and muſcular; it has five toes on each foot, and uſes its fore foot as a hand, although the toes are not ſeparated as in moſt animals that do ſo; the largeſt finger is on the outſide.</p>
               <p>The voice of the Bear is a deep and ſurly kind of growl, which it frequently exerts without the leaſt cauſe. It is very eaſily irritated; and at that time its reſentment is furious, and often capriciouſly exerted.—When tamed, it appears mild and obedient to its maſter; but it is not to be truſted without the utmoſt caution. It may be taught to walk upright, to dance, to lay hold of a pole with its paws, and perform various tricks to entertain the multitude, who are highly pleaſed to ſee the auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meaſures of this rugged creature, which it ſeems to ſuit to the ſound of an inſtrument, or to the voice of its leader. But to give the Bear this kind of education, it muſt be taken when young, and accuſtomed early to reſtraint and diſcipline: An old Bear will ſuffer neither, without diſcovering the moſt furious reſentment; neither the voice nor the menaces of his keeper have any effect upon him; he equally growls at the hand that is held out to feed, as at that which is raiſed to correct him.</p>
               <p>The exceſſive cruelties practiſed upon this poor animal in teaching it to walk erect, and regulate its motions to the ſound of the flagelet, are ſuch as make ſenſibility ſhudder. Its eyes are put out; and an iron ring being put through the cartilage of the noſe to lead it by, it is kept from food, and beaten, till it yield obedience to the will of its ſavage tutors. Some of them are taught to perform by ſetting their feet upon hot iron plates, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0209200900:255"/>
then playing to them whilſt in this uneaſy ſituation.— It is truly ſhocking to every feeling mind to reflect, that ſuch cruelties ſhould be exerciſed upon any part of the brute creation by our fellow men. That they ſhould be rewarded by numbers of unthinking people, who crowd around them to ſee the poor animal's rude attempts to imitate human actions, is not to be wondered at; but it is much to be wiſhed, that the timely interference of the magiſtrate would prevent every exhibition of this kind, that, in England at leaſt, we might not be reproached with tolerating practices ſo diſgraceful to humanity.</p>
               <p>One of theſe animals, preſented to the prince of Wales a few years ago, was kept in the Tower. By the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of the ſervant, the door of his den was left open; and the keeper's wife happening to go acroſs the court at the ſame time, the animal flew out, ſeized the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, threw her down, and faſtened upon her neck, which he bit; and, without offering any further vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, lay upon her, ſucking the blood out of the wound. Reſiſtance was in vain, as it only ſerved to irritate the creature; and ſhe muſt inevitably have periſhed, had not her huſband luckily diſcovered her ſituation. By a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den blow, he obliged the Bear to quit his hold, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to his den, which he did with great reluctance, and not without making a ſecond attempt to come at the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was almoſt dead through fear and loſs of blood. It is ſomewhat remarkable, that whenever it happened to ſee her afterwards, it growled, and made moſt violent ſtruggles to get out to her.—The prince, upon hearing of the circumſtance, ordered the Bear to be killed.</p>
               <p>The Bears of America are ſmall and black, live entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon vegetable food, and are particularly fond of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0209200900:256"/>
maize, potatoes, honey, and milk. Though preſſed with extreme hunger, they will not eat animal food.—They lodge in the hollow trunks of large trees, which they aſcend and deſcend with great eaſe and agility.—The hunters take them by ſetting fire to their habitations. The old one comes out firſt, and is generally ſlain before ſhe reaches the ground; the cubs follow her, and are taken alive.—The fleſh of the young Bear is reckoned a great delicacy; and the paws of the old one are eſteemed as a moſt exquiſite morſel. The fat is white, and very ſweet; and the oil is ſaid to be of great uſe in ſoftening ſwellings proceeding from ſprains.—Great numbers are killed annually in America for the ſake of their ſkins, which form a conſiderable article of commerce.</p>
               <p>Bears were formerly common in Greece. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans brought them from Lybia to be exhibited in their public ſpectacles. They are likewiſe found in China, Japan, and as far as the iſland of Java.</p>
               <p>The mountains of Great Tartary produce great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Bears perfectly white, which do not differ in form from thoſe juſt mentioned. Some, from the confines of Ruſſia, are of a mixed colour, with black and white hairs.</p>
               <p>The Bear was once an inhabitant of this iſland, and was included in the ancient laws and regulations reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaſts of chaſe. Long after their extirpation, they were imported for the cruel purpoſe of baiting them, which at that time was a favourite amuſement of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. We find it in queen Elizabeth's days among the various entertainments prepared for her majeſty on her viſit at Kenilworth.</p>

               <p>differs greatly from the preceding in the length of its head and neck, and grows to above twice the ſize. Some of theſe animals are thirteen feet long. Their limbs are of great ſize and ſtrength; their hair long, harſh and diſagreeable to the touch, and of a yellowiſh-white colour; their ears are ſhort and rounded; and their teeth large.</p>
               <p>This animal inhabits only the coldeſt parts of the globe. It has been found above latitude 80, as far as navigators have penetrated northwards. Theſe inhoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table regions ſeem adapted to its ſullen nature.</p>

               <p>They have been ſeldom ſeen farther ſouth than New-foundland; and are chiefly met with on the ſhores of Hudſon's Bay, Greenland, and Spitzbergen, on one ſide, and thoſe of Nova-Zembla on the other. They have been ſometimes found in the intermediate countries of Norway and Iceland; but ſuch as have appeared in thoſe parts have always been driven thither upon floating ſheets of ice; ſo that thoſe countries are only acquainted with them by accident.—They are very numerous on the ſhores of Kamtſchatka; and the following account of the manner of hunting them by the natives of that country is given in Captain Cook's voyage:—</p>
               <p>"The natives generally contrive to reach the ground, frequented by the Bears, about ſun-ſet. Their firſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, when they arrive there, is to look out for their tracks, and to attend particularly to the freſheſt of them, always paying a regard to the ſituation with reſpect to concealment, and taking aim at the animal as it paſſes by, or as it advances or goes from them. Theſe tracks are numerous between the woods and the lakes, and are often found among the long ſedgy graſs and brakes on the margin of the water. Having determined upon a convenient ſpot for concealment, the hunters fix their crutches in the ground, on which they reſt their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, pointing them in a proper direction. They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards kneel or lie down, as the circumſtances of their ſituation may require; and, having their bear-ſpears in readineſs by their ſide, wait the arrival of their game. —Theſe precautions are extremely neceſſary on many accounts, that the hunters may make ſure of their mark:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0209200900:259"/>
For the price of ammunition is ſo high at Kamtſchatka, that the value of a Bear will not purchaſe more of it than will load a muſquet four or five times. It is much more material on another conſideration; for, if the firſt ſhot ſhould not render the animal incapable of purſuit, fatal conſequences too frequently enſue. The enraged beaſt makes immediately towards the place from whence the ſound and ſmoke iſſue, and furiouſly attacks his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. They have not ſufficient time to re-load their pieces, as the Bear is ſeldom fired at till he comes within the diſtance of fifteen yards; therefore, if he ſhould not happen to fall, they immediately prepare to receive him upon their ſpears; their ſafety depending, in a great meaſure, on their giving him a mortal ſtab as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards them. Should he parry the thruſt, (which theſe animals are ſometimes enabled to do, by the ſtrength and agility of their paws) and break in upon his opponents, the conflict becomes dreadful, and it is ſeldom that the loſs of a ſingle life will ſatisfy the beaſt's revenge.</p>
               <p>"The buſineſs or diverſion of Bear-hunting is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly dangerous at two ſeaſons of the year: In the ſpring, when they firſt iſſue from their caves, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſiſted the whole winter (as it is here poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted) ſolely on ſucking their paws; and eſpecially if the froſt ſhould continue to be ſevere, and the ice in the lakes is not broken up; as they cannot then have recourſe to their cuſtomary and expected food. Thus becoming exceedingly famiſhed, they grow fierce and ſavage in proportion; purſuing the inhabitants by the ſcent; and, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. Under theſe circumſtances, as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0209200900:260"/>
the natives have no idea of ſhooting flying, or even run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or in any manner without reſting their piece, they often fall a ſacrifice to their rapacity.—The time of their copulation, which is in autumn, is the other dangerous ſeaſon to meet with them.</p>
               <p>"Many extraordinary and affecting inſtances of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection in theſe animals are related by the Kamt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchadales; who, from this circumſtance, derive conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantage in hunting. They never preſume to fire at a young Bear, if the dam is upon the ſpot; for, if the cub ſhould happen to be killed, ſhe becomes enraged to an immoderate degree; and, if ſhe can only obtain a ſight of the offender, ſhe is ſure to be revenged of him, or die in the attempt. On the other hand, if the mother ſhould be ſhot, the cubs continue by her ſide after ſhe has been a long time dead; exhibiting, by the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting geſtures and motions, the moſt poignant afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The hunters, inſtead of commiſerating their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, embrace theſe opportunities of deſtroying them.</p>
               <p>"If the veracity of the Kamtſchadales is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, the ſagacity of the Bears is as extraordinary as their natural affection.—Innumerable are the ſtories which they relate to this effect. One remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, however, we cannot avoid mentioning, as it is admitted among the natives as a well-atteſted fact. It is the ſtratagem they put in practice to catch the bareins, which run too ſwift for them to expect ſucceſs in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Theſe animals herd together in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and their uſual haunts are low grounds, at the foot of rocks and precipices, where they delight in browſing. The Bear purſues them by the ſcent, till he obtains a view of them; and then advances warily, keeping in a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0209200900:261"/>
ſituation above them; at the ſame time concealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the rocks as the approaches, till he is almoſt immediately over them, and near enough to carry his purpoſe into execution: Then, with his paws, he puſhes down large pieces of the rock amongſt the herd below. If he perceives that he has ſucceeded in maiming any of the flock, he immediately purſues them; and according to the injury the poor bareins have received, he either proves ſucceſsful in overtaking them, or they eſcape by the rapidity of their flight.</p>
               <p>"The Kamtſchadales acknowledge infinite obligations to the Bears for all the little progreſs they have hitherto made, as well in the ſciences as the polite arts. They confeſs themſelves indebted wholly to thoſe animals for all their knowledge in phyſic and ſurgery; that, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what herbs they have applied to the wounds they have received, and what methods they have purſued when they were languid and out of order, they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a knowledge of moſt of thoſe ſimples which they have now recourſe to, either as external or internal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. But the moſt ſingular circumſtance of all is, that they admit the Bears to be their dancing-maſters; though the evidence of our own ſenſes places this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beyond all diſpute; for, in the bear-dance of the Kamtſchadales, every geſture and attitude peculiar to that animal was faithfully exhibited. All their other dances are ſimilar to this in many particulars; and thoſe attitudes are thought to come the neareſt to perfection which moſt reſemble the motions of the Bear."</p>
               <p>During ſummer, theſe animals take up their reſidence on large iſlands of ice, and frequently paſs from one to another. They ſwim well, and can go to the diſtance of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0209200900:262"/>
ſix or ſeven leagues: They likewiſe dive, but do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long under water.—When the pieces of ice are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached by ſtrong winds or currents, the Bears allow themſelves to be carried along with them; and as they cannot regain the land, or abandon the ice on which they are embarked, they often periſh in the open ſea. Thoſe which arrive with the ice on the coaſts of Iceland or Norway, are almoſt famiſhed with hunger from the length of their voyage, and are extremely voracious.— As ſoon as the natives diſcover one of them, they arm themſelves, and preſently diſpatch him.</p>
               <p>The ferocity of the Bear is as remarkable as its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to its young. A few years ſince, the crew of a boat belonging to a ſhip in the whale-fiſhery ſhot at a Bear at a ſhort diſtance, and wounded it: The animal immediately ſet up the moſt dreadful yells, and ran along the ice towards the boat. Before it reached it, a ſecond ſhot was fired at and hit it. This ſerved to increaſe its fury. It preſently ſwam to the boat; and in attempting to get on board, reached its fore foot upon the gunnel; but one of the crew having a hatchet, cut it off. The animal ſtill, however, continued to ſwim after them till they arrived at the ſhip; and ſeveral ſhots were fired at it, which alſo took effect: But on reaching the ſhip, it immediately aſcended the deck; and the crew having fled into the ſhrowds, it was purſuing them thither, when a ſhot from one of them laid it dead upon the deck.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of theſe animals is white, and ſaid to taſte like mutton. The fat is melted for train-oil; and that of the feet is uſed in medicine.</p>
               <p>The White Bear brings forth two young at a time. Their fondneſs for their offspring is ſo great, that they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0209200900:263"/>
will die rather than deſert them. Wounds ſerve only to make the attachment more violent. They embrace their cubs to the laſt, and bemoan them with the moſt piteous cries.</p>
               <p>Theſe creatures feed on fiſh, ſeals, and the carcaſes of whales; are fond of human blood; and are ſo fearleſs, as to attack companies of armed men, and even to board ſmall veſſels. Allured by the ſcent of ſeals fleſh, they often break into the huts of the Greenlanders. They ſometimes attack the Morſe; with which they have ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible conflicts: But the large teeth of that animal give it a decided ſuperiority over the Bear, which is generally worſted.</p>

                  <figure/> THE STRIPED HYENA.</head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH naturaliſts, both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, have deſcribed the Hyena under different denominations, and have aſcribed to it properties which it is now known not to poſſeſs; yet its characters are ſo ſingular, that it is impoſſible to miſtake them, and ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, as to diſtinguiſh it from every other claſs of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. In many reſpects it reſembles thoſe of the Dog kind, has ſome ſimilitude to the Wolf in form and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and is about the ſame ſize.</p>
               <p>The Hyena has only four toes on each foot, in which it differs from almoſt every other quadruped; its head is broad and flat, and its muzzle ſhorter than that of the Wolf; its fore legs are longer than the hind ones; its ears are long, pointed, and bare; and its eyes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably wild, ſullen, and ferocious.</p>
               <p>There are two varieties of this animal,—the one ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the other ſpotted. The hair of the former is of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0209200900:265"/>
an aſh colour, marked with long black ſtripes, diſpoſed in waves, from the back downward; there are others acroſs the legs; the hair, in general, is coarſe and rough; its tail is ſhort and buſhy, with pretty long hair, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plain, and ſometimes barred with black; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately underneath the tail, and above the anus, there is an orifice like that of the Badger, which opens into a kind of pouch, and contains a ſubſtance of the conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of civet, but of a rank, diſagreeable odour. This opening may probably have given riſe to the error of the ancients, who aſſerted, that the Hyena was every alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate year male and female. Its manner of holding its head is ſomewhat like a Dog purſuing a ſcent, with its noſe near the ground. This poſition of the head makes the ſhoulders appear more elevated. A briſtly mane runs along the top of the back from head to tail, which gives it an appearance ſomething like a Hog; from whence, probably, it may have derived its name, the word <hi>huaina</hi> being a Greek word derived from <hi>hus,</hi> which ſignifies a Sow.—Such are the moſt ſtriking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of the Hyena, which has been pictured by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and timidity under every form that can ſtrike terror into the imagination. Wonderful powers were aſcribed to it by the ancients; who believed that it changed its ſex; that it imitated the human voice, and by that means attracted unwary travellers, and deſtroyed them; that it had the power of charming the ſhepherds, and as it were rivetting them to the place where they ſtood. Many other things, equally abſurd, have been told of this animal; but theſe are ſufficient to ſhew, that objects of terror and ſuperſtition are nearly allied; and when once they have taken poſſeſſion of the human mind,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0209200900:266"/>
the moſt improbable ſtories are eaſily received and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited.</p>
               <p>This ſavage and ſolitary animal reſides in the caverns of mountains, in the clefts of rocks, or in holes and dens, which it digs in the earth.—Its diſpoſition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ferocious; and, though taken young, it never can be tamed.—It lives by depredations, like the Wolf; but is ſtronger, and more daring and rapacious. It will ſometimes attack men, and ruſhes with fury upon all kinds of cattle: It follows the flocks, ravages the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and deſtroys every thing within its reach with the moſt inſatiable voracity.—Its eyes ſhine in the dark; and it is aſſerted, with ſome appearance of probability, that it can ſee nearly as well by night as by day.—When de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of other proviſions, it ranſacks the graves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours putrid human bodies that have been long buried.</p>
               <p>The voice of the Hyena is very peculiar: Its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeems to be ſomewhat like the moaning of a human voice, and the ending like one making a violent effort to vomit.</p>
               <p>This animal inhabits Aſiatic Turkey, Syria, Perſia, and Barbary.—The ſuperſtitious Arabs, when they kill one of them, carefully bury the head, leſt it ſhould be applied to magical purpoſes.</p>
               <p>The courage of the Hyena is equal to its rapacity: It will defend itſelf with great obſtinacy againſt much larger quadrupeds: It is not afraid of the Lion nor the Panther, will ſometimes attack the Ounce, and ſeldom fails to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>

                  <figure/> THE SPOTTED HYENA</head>
               <p>is called at the Cape of Good Hope the <hi>Tiger-Wolf,</hi> and is very common in that part of the world.—Sparrman deſcribes it as a cruel, miſchievous, and formidable ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. Its horrid yells are to be heard every night, whilſt it prowls about for its prey, and lurks near the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, where cattle are kept: Theſe are well defended by Dogs, of which the Hyena, though larger and ſtronger, is much afraid; and will not venture an attack, unleſs preſſed by the moſt urgent neceſſity: Neither will it dare to ſeize upon any of the larger animals; ſuch as Oxen, Cows, Horſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. whilſt they make the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of defending themſelves, or even if they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray any ſymptoms of fear. It ſometimes endeavours to diſperſe the cattle by its hideous roaring; after which it ſelects and purſues one of them, which it ſoon diſables by a deadly bite, and then devours.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals were formerly ſo bold, as to moleſt the Hottentots in their huts, and ſometimes carry off their
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0209200900:268"/>
children; but, ſince the introduction of fire-arms, thoſe and other wild beaſts keep at a greater diſtance from the habitations of mankind. It is a fact, however, that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of theſe Wolves are known to attend almoſt every dark night about the ſhambles at the Cape; where they meet with bones, ſkin, and other offals, which are left there by the inhabitants, who ſuffer the animals to come unmoleſted, and carry off their refuſe; and it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remarkable, that they have ſeldom been known to do any miſchief there, though fed in the very heart of the town.</p>
               <p>The howlings of the Hyena are dreadful beyond all conception, and ſpread a general alarm. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inceſſant, and ſeem to be the natural conſequence of its craving appetite. Perhaps it may not be going too far to ſay, that Nature has kindly impreſſed this involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſpoſition to yelling upon this animal, that every living creature might be upon its guard, and ſecure it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the attacks of ſo cruel an enemy.</p>
               <p>The general colour of this animal is a reddiſh-brown, marked with diſtinct round black ſpots, the hind legs with tranſverſe black bars; its head is large and flat; above each eye, as well as on the lips, it has long whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; a ſhort black mane runs along the top of the back; its ears are ſhort and a little pointed; its face and the upper part of its head are black.</p>

                  <figure/> THE JACKAL.</head>
               <p>WE beg leave to make our acknowledgments to Mr Pennant for the drawing of this animal, which he was ſo obliging as to favour us with. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us it was drawn from the living animal; and we doubt not, therefore, its being a faithful repreſentation.</p>
               <p>The ſpecies of the Jackal is diffuſed, with ſome varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, through almoſt every part of Aſia; and is found in Barbary, and other parts of Africa as far as the Cape of Good Hope. Although it is one of the moſt numerous of all the wild animals of the Eaſt, there is ſcarcely any leſs known in Europe, or more confuſedly deſcribed by natural hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>Theſe creatures differ in ſize; thoſe of the warmeſt climates are ſaid to be the largeſt: They are of a reddiſh-brown colour. The ſmaller Jackal is about the ſize of a Fox; and its colour is a bright-yellow.—In general, this animal may be ſaid to partake of a middle nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wolf and the Dog; and to the ſavage fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the one, it adds the impudent familiarity of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0209200900:270"/>
other.—Its cry is a diſmal howl, mixed with barking. It is more noiſy in its purſuits than the Dog, and more voracious than the Wolf.</p>
               <p>Jackals go in packs of forty or fifty, and hunt like hounds in full cry from evening till morning. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the poultry, and attack the flocks: They roam through the villages and gardens, and carry off every thing they can eat: They enter ſtables, yards, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes; and devour ſkins, and every thing that is made of leather; ſuch as harneſſing, boots, ſhoes, &amp;c. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can eſcape their rapacity: They will ranſack the repoſitories of the dead, and greedily devour the moſt putrid bodies; for which reaſon, in thoſe countries where they abound, the inhabitants are obliged to make the graves of a great depth, and ſecure them with ſpines to prevent the Jackals from raking up the earth with their feet. They are ſaid to attend caravans, and follow armies, in hopes of being furniſhed with a banquet by diſeaſe or battle.—They may be conſidered as the vulture among quadrupeds; and, like that deſtructive bird, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour every thing indiſcriminately that has once had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals hide themſelves in holes and dens by day, and ſeldom appear abroad till the evening; when they fill the air with the moſt horrid howlings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the chaſe. The Lion, the Panther, and other beaſts of prey that do not follow by the ſcent, take advantage of the general conſternation, and follow in ſilence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind till the Jackals have hunted down their prey: They then devour the fruits of their labours, and leave them only the remains of the ſpoil; from whence the Jackal has been vulgarly called the <hi>Lion's Provider,</hi> as if thoſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0209200900:271"/>
two animals acted in concert, and had formed a plan for their mutual ſupport.</p>
               <p>The Jackal frequently purſues the Gazelle; and is ſo bold, as to follow it even into the midſt of a town or village, whither that timid animal frequently flies for protection, and by that means ſometimes eſcapes: For the inceſſant barking of the Jackal alarms the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; who ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sparrman's deſcription of thoſe he ſaw at the Cape differs materially from the accounts we have been able to collect from other authors. He ſays they are about three feet in length, and their tails little more than a foot long: The predominant colour is a reddiſh-yellow; the legs are of a pale-gold colour; under the belly, and on the inſide of the legs, the colour inclines to white; the noſe and ears are of a brighter red; the head, neck, and back, are grey; the tail is partly grey, and partly of an umber colour, and black at the tip. He ſays it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the European Fox in form, manners, and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and is not known to aſſemble in packs for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of hunting; neither is its voracity equal to that aſcribed to it by other naruraliſts.—It is probable it may have been confounded with the Wild Dog, which is common at the Cape, and hunts its prey in packs.

               <head>THE FOX.</head>
               <p>THIS lively and crafty animal is common to every part of Great-Britain; and is ſo well known, as not to require a particular deſcription.</p>
               <p>M. Buffon has taken great pains to prove, that the Dog and the Fox will not breed together. For this purpoſe, he kept two males and a female for a conſiderable time, and tried to make the males copulate with bitches, which they uniformly refuſed; and from thence he concludes, that no mixture can take place between the two ſpecies. But it ſhould be remembered, that the Foxes were in a ſtate of confinement; and of courſe, many circumſtances might concur to diſguſt them, and render the experiment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In confirmation of this, we need only obſerve, that the ſame Foxes, which, when at liberty, darted on the poultry with their uſual eagerneſs, never attempted to touch a ſingle fowl after they were chained: And we are told further, "that a living hen was generally fixed near them for a whole night; and, though food was kept from them for many hours, yet, in ſpite of hunger and opportunity, they never forgot that they were chained, and diſturbed not the hen." Now if any one ſhould be ſo h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſmalleſt doubt. It is a common practice in many places to tie up a bitch that is in ſeaſon, where ſhe may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by a Fox, and be impregnated by him: The fruits of the connection are ſufficiently obvious; moſt, if not all the puppies have a ſtrong reſemblance to the Fox: The ſharp noſe, prick ears, long body, and ſhort legs of the Fox, evidently point out their origin.—Theſe Dogs are highly eſteemed by farmers and graziers as the moſt uſeful kind for driving cattle. They bite keenly; are extremely active and playful; and are very expert at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying weaſels, rats, and other vermin.</p>
               <p>The Fox ſleeps much during the day; but the night is its ſeaſon of activity, and the time when it roams about in ſearch of prey.—It will eat fleſh of any kind; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that of hares, rabbits, poultry, and all kinds of birds. Thoſe that reſide near the ſea coaſts will for want of other food eat crabs, ſhrimps, muſcles, and other ſhell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh.</p>
               <p>In France and Italy, the Fox does great damage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vineyards by feeding on the grapes, of which it is extremely fond.—It boldly attacks the wild bees, and frequently robs them of their ſtores; but not with impunity: The whole ſwarm flies out, and faſtens upon the invader; but he retires only for a few minutes, and rids himſelf of the bees by rolling upon the ground; by which means he cruſhes ſuch as ſtick to him, and then returns to his charge, and devours both wax and honey.</p>
               <p>The cunning of the Fox in ſurprizing and ſecuring its prey is equally remarkable: When it has acquired more than it can devour, its firſt care is to ſecure what it has killed, which is generally all within its reach. It digs
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0209200900:275"/>
holes in different places, where it conceals its booty by carefully covering it with earth to prevent a diſcovery. If a flock of poultry have unfortunately fallen victims to its ſtratagems, it will bring them, one by one, to theſe hiding-places; where it leaves them till hunger demands freſh ſupplies.</p>
               <p>The chaſe of the Fox is a very favourite diverſion in this kingdom, and is no-where purſued with ſuch ardour and intrepidity. Both our Dogs and Horſes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly ſuperior to thoſe of any other country.—The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the Fox finds he is purſued, he flies towards his hole; and finding it ſtopped, which is always carefully done before the chaſe begins, he has recourſe to his ſpeed and his cunning for ſafety. He does not double and meaſure his ground back like the Hare; but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues his courſe ſtraight forward before the Hounds with great ſtrength and perſeverance. Both Dogs and Horſes, particularly the latter, have frequently fallen victims to the ardour of the purſuit; which has ſometimes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for upwards of fifty miles without the ſmalleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, and almoſt at full ſpeed <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr CHARLES TURNER'S Hounds hunted at Ayreyholm, near Hurworth, in the county of Durham, and found the noted old Fox CESAR, which made an extraordinary chaſe: After a round of four miles, he led to Smeaton, through Hornby and Appleton; then back again to Hornby, Worſet-moor, Pierſburgh, Limpton, Craythorn, Middleton, Hilton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seamer, Newby, Marton, Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; then upon Hambleton, through Kirkleatham-park, Uplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham, Sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0209200900:276"/>
hard to ſay, whether the ſpirited eagerneſs of the Hounds, the ardour of the Horſes, or the enthuſiaſm of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is moſt to be admired. The Fox is the only one of the party which has the plea of neceſſity on his ſide; and it operates ſo ſtrongly, that he often eſcapes the utmoſt efforts of his purſuers, and returns to his hole in ſafety. The ſmell of his urine is ſo offenſive to the Dogs, that it ſometimes proves the means of his eſcape from them. When all his ſhifts have failed him, and he is at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, he then defends himſelf with great obſtinacy, and fights in ſilence till he is torn in pieces by the Dogs.</p>

In this poſition, he ſpies the birds as they alight on the hedges or places near him, and is ready to ſpring upon ſuch as are within his reach. He rarely lies expoſed; but chuſes the cover of ſome thick brake, where he is pretty ſecure from being ſurprized.—Crows, magpies, and other birds which conſider the Fox as a common enemy, will often give notice of his retreat by the moſt clamourous notes; and frequently follow him a conſiderable way from tree to tree, repeating their outcries.</p>
               <p>Foxes produce but once a year, from three to ſix young ones at a time. When the female is pregnant, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, and ſeldom goes out of her hole, where ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a bed for her young. She comes in ſeaſon in the winter; and young Foxes are found in the month of April. If ſhe perceive that her habitation is diſcovered, ſhe carries them off, one by one, to a more ſecure retreat. —The young are brought forth blind, like puppies. They grow eighteen months or two years, and live thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>The Fox is frequently taken in traps; but great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be uſed to deceive this wily animal. The trap muſt be placed in the midſt of a field, where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hedge nor path near it; and ſo nicely covered with mould, that not the leaſt veſtige can be ſeen where it lies: About the trap, and at a ſmall diſtance from it, in different places, a few pieces of cheeſe, or other ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ſcented food, muſt be careleſsly ſcattered: Then with a Sheep's paunch, or ſome other animal ſubſtance, a trail is made, of about a mile in length, to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0209200900:279"/>
places where the bait is laid, and from thence to the trap: The ſhoes of the perſon who carries the trail muſt be likewiſe well rubbed with the paunch, that the Fox may not diſcover his ſcent. He then approaches with more confidence; and if the deſign be well conducted, ſeldom fails of being caught.</p>
               <p>There are great varieties of this animal apparently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the influence of climate. Thoſe of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are moſtly of a tawny-red, mixed with aſh colour; the fore part of the legs is black; and the tail tipt with white.—In colder countries, Foxes are of various colours.</p>

It is found in Greenland, Iceland, Spitzbergen, Nova-Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla, and Lapland; in Kamtſchatka, and the oppoſite parts of America.—It burrows in the ground, and makes holes ſeveral feet in length, at the end of which it forms a neſt with moſs. In Greenland and Spitzbergen, it lives in the clefts of rocks, being unable to burrow on account of the froſt. Two or three of them inhabit the ſame hole.</p>
               <p>This animal is endowed with all the cunning of the common Fox; preys on young geeſe, ducks, and other water-fowl, before they are able to fly; likewiſe, on
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0209200900:281"/>
hares, wild birds, and eggs: And in Greenland, for want of other food, it feeds on berries and ſhell-fiſh. In Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the North of Aſia, their principal food is the Leming, or Lapland Marmot; immenſe ſhoals of which ſometimes cover the face of the country. The Foxes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, in their migrations, from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as the return of the Marmot is very uncertain, and frequently after great intervals of time, they are ſometimes abſent three or four years in purſuit of this their favourite prey.</p>
               <p>The hair of the Arctic Fox is of an aſh colour, but changes to white in the winter, when it is long, ſoft, and ſomewhat woolly: Its tail is ſhorter than that of the common Fox, and more buſhy; and its toes are covered with fur on the under part, like thoſe of a Hare: It is ſmaller and more ſlender than the European Fox: Its noſe is ſharp and black; and its ears ſhort, and almoſt hid in the fur.—It is ſometimes taken in traps; but its ſkin being of little value, it is not hunted with much eagerneſs.</p>

                  <figure/> THE WOLF.</head>
               <p>ALL naturaliſts agree in placing the Wolf and the Dog in the ſame claſs; and, from the ſlighteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of their outward form only, one would be led to conclude the Wolf was in every reſpect a Dog in its ſtate of natural freedom. The chief difference conſiſts in the form of its head; its eyes are fixed in a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique poſition, and being of a bright-green colour, give it a look of the moſt ſavage fierceneſs; its ears are ſharp and erect; its tail long, buſhy, and bending inwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its hind legs; its body is ſtronger than that of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any ſpecies of Dogs, its jaws and teeth larger, and its hair coarſer and thicker. The internal ſtructure of theſe animals is, however, very ſimilar. The Wolf cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the ſame manner as the Dog; and its immediate ſeparation is prevented from the ſame cauſe. The time of geſtation is alſo nearly the ſame; and, from a variety of ſucceſsful experiments related by the celebrated Dr Hunter, there is no longer any room to doubt, that the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0209200900:283"/>
Wolf and the Dog will copulate together, and produce an intermediate ſpecies, capable of ſubſequent propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The appetite of the Wolf, for every kind of animal food, is exceſſively voracious; and, although Nature has furniſhed it with every requiſite for purſuing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering its prey, it is frequently reduced to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and ſometimes periſhes for want of food: So great is the general deteſtation of this deſtructive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all the wild animals endeavour to avoid it, and moſt commonly eſcape by their ſuperior ſwiftneſs.— When preſſed with hunger from repeated diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Wolf becomes ingenious from want, and courageous from neceſſity. It then braves every danger, and even attacks thoſe animals that are under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of man. Sometimes whole droves of them join in the cruel work of general devaſtation, roam through the villages, and attack the ſheepfolds: They dig the earth under the doors, enter with dreadful ferocity, and put every living creature to death before they depart. The Horſe is the only tame animal that can defend itſelf againſt them: All the weaker animals become their prey; even man himſelf, upon theſe occaſions, frequently falls a victim to their rapacity; and it is ſaid, that when once they have taſted human blood, they always give it the preference.—From hence, many ſuperſtitious ſtories have been told of the Wolf: The old Saxons believed that it was poſſeſſed by ſome evil ſpirit, and called it the <hi>Were-Wolf;</hi> and the French peaſants, from the ſame reaſon, call it the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The language of the poet is beautifully deſcriptive of this creature's inſatiable fury:—
<q>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0209200900:284"/>
                     <l>By wintry famine rous'd, from all the tract</l>
                     <l>Of horrid mountains, which the ſhining Alps,</l>

                     <l>Branch out, ſtupendous, into diſtant lands,</l>
                     <l>Cruel as death! and hungry as the grave!</l>

                     <l>Aſſembling Wolves, in raging troops, deſcend;</l>
                     <l>And, pouring o'er the country, bear along,</l>
                     <l>Keen as the north wind ſweeps the gloſſy ſnow:</l>
                     <l>All is their prize.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Wolf has great ſtrength, eſpecially in the muſcles of his neck and jaws. He can carry a Sheep in his mouth, and eaſily run off with it in that manner. His bite is cruel and deadly, and keener as it meets with leſs reſiſtance; but when oppoſed, he is cautious and circumſpect, and ſeldom fights but from neceſſity. He is harder and more robuſt, but not ſo ſenſible as the Dog. He almoſt inceſſantly prowls about for prey, and of all animals is the moſt difficult to conquer in the chaſe. His ſenſe of ſmelling is peculiarly ſtrong: He ſcents the track of animals, and follows it with great perſeverance: The odour of carrion ſtrikes him at the diſtance of near a league.—Wolves are capable of bearing want of food for a long time: To allay their hunger, they will ſometimes fill their ſtomachs with mud. They have been known to follow armies, and aſſemble in troops upon the field of battle; tear up ſuch bodies as have been careleſsly interred, and devour them with inſatiable avidity.</p>
               <p>In all ages, the Wolf has been conſidered as the moſt ſavage enemy of mankind, and rewards given for its head. Various methods have been taken to rid the world of this rapacious invader: Pit-falls, traps, and poiſon, have all been employed againſt him; and, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0209200900:285"/>
for theſe iſlands, the whole race has long been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated here. King Edgar attempted to effect it in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by remitting the puniſhment of certain crimes on producing a number of Wolves' tongues; and in Wales, the tax of gold and ſilver was commuted for an annual tribute of Wolves' heads.—Some centuries after that, theſe animals increaſed to ſuch a degree, as to become an object of royal attention; and great rewards were given for deſtroying them. Camden informs us, that certain perſons held their lands on condition of hunting and deſtroying the Wolves that infeſted the country; whence they were called the <hi>Wolve-hunt.</hi> In the reign of Athelſtan, Wolves abounded ſo much in Yorkſhire, that a retreat was built at Flixton to defend paſſengers from their attacks.—As the ravages of theſe animals were greateſt during winter, particularly in January, when the cold was ſevereſt, our Saxon anceſtors diſtinguiſhed that month by the title of <hi>Wolf-moneth:</hi> They alſo called an outlaw <hi>Wolfſhed,</hi> as being out of the protection of the law, and as liable to be killed as that deſtructive beaſt.— They infeſted Ireland many centuries after their extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in England; the laſt preſentment for killing Wolves being made in the county of Cork about the year 1710.</p>

up, and ſtraining themſelves to catch the bait, which is placed juſt within their reach; and while the animals are buſily employed in this way, the hunters being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with fire-arms, ſeldom fail to diſpatch them.— In a convenient place, at the foot of a declivity, they make a ſmall incloſure of ſtrong pales, ſo high, that the Wolf having once entered, cannot return again. An opening is left at the top of the bank; and a Sheep that has been long dead, is the bait, to which he is allured by long trains, made from different places where he is known to haunt. As ſoon as he arrives at the ſpot, he examines every part of the incloſure; and, finding no other way to come at the booty, he precipitates himſelf to the bottom; and, having made a plentiful meal, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in vain to reaſcend. His diſappointment at not being able to get back is productive of the moſt dreadful howlings, which alarm his enemies; and they either take him alive, or diſpatch him with bludgeons.—It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that when this animal finds there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of eſcaping, his courage entirely forſakes him; and he is for ſome time ſo ſtupified with fear, that he may be killed without offering to reſiſt, or taken alive without much danger.—Wolves are ſometimes taken in ſtrong nets, into which they are driven by the hunters, who ſurround a large tract of land, and with drums, horns, and other inſtruments, accompanied with loud cries from a large company aſſembled upon the occaſion, drive the animals towards the entrance of the nets; where they are entangled, and killed with clubs and hatchets. Great care muſt be taken to ſecure them at firſt: If they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from their conſternation, they eaſily eſcape by tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the net to pieces.</p>

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0209200900:287"/>Wolves are found, with ſome variety, in almoſt every country of the world. Thoſe of Senegal are larger and fiercer than thoſe of Europe.—In North-America, they are ſmall, of a dark colour, and may be eaſily tamed. Before the introduction of Dogs, the ſavages made uſe of them in hunting the wild animals of the country; and they are ſtill employed for the ſame purpoſe in the more remote parts of that vaſt continent. They are ſaid to hunt in packs, and run down the Deer by their ſcent.— The appearance of theſe animals near the habitations of the Indians, ſometimes indicates that the Biſon or the Deer is at no great diſtance; and when any of thoſe are taken, the Wolves are rewarded with the offal.—Cateſby affirms, that the Wolves of that country have mixed with the Dogs carried thither by the Europeans, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an intermediate race.—In the northern regions, there are Wolves entirely white, and others of a deep-black.—In Mexico, there is a variety of the Wolf with a very large head, ſtrong jaws, and great teeth: On the upper lip it has ſtrong briſtles, not unlike the ſofter ſpines of the Porcupine, of a grey and white colour; its ears are large and erect; its body is aſh-coloured, ſpotted with black; on its ſides there are black ſtripes from the back downward; its neck is fat and thick, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a looſe ſkin, marked with a long tawny ſtroke; on the breaſt is another of the ſame kind; the tail is long, and tinged in the middle with tawny; the legs and feet are ſtriped with black. It inhabits the hot parts of Mexico or New Spain, is equally voracious with the European Wolf, attacks cattle, and ſometimes men. —There are no Wolves farther South on the new conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>

               <p>THE ſervices of this truly valuable creature have been ſo eminently uſeful to the domeſtic intereſts of men in all ages, that to give the hiſtory of the Dog would be little leſs than to trace mankind back to their original ſtate of ſimplicity and freedom, to mark the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of civilization through the various changes of the world, and to follow attentively the gradual advancement of that order which placed man at the head of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal world, and gave him a manifeſt ſuperiority over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the brute creation.</p>
               <p>If we conſider for a moment the ſtate of man without the aid of this uſeful domeſtic;—with what arts ſhall he oppoſe the numerous hoſts of foes that ſurround him on all ſides, ſeeking every opportunity to encroach upon his poſſeſſions, to deſtroy his labours, or endanger his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſafety? or how ſhall he bring into ſubjection ſuch as are neceſſary for his well-being? His utmoſt vigilance will not be ſufficient to ſecure him from the rapacity of the one, nor his greateſt exertions enable him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſpeed of the other. To maintain his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, to inſure his ſafety, and to provide for his ſupport, it was neceſſary that ſome one among the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſhould be brought over to his aſſiſtance, whoſe zeal and fidelity might be depended on. And where, amidſt all the various orders of animated being, could one be ſound ſo entirely adapted to this purpoſe? where could one be found ſo bold, ſo tractable, and ſo obedient as the Dog? Without its aſſiſtance, how could man have conquered, tamed, and reduced other animals into ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? how could he have hunted down and deſtroyed thoſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0209200900:289"/>
noxious animals, from whoſe rapacity his life was in continual danger?—To confirm the truth of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, we need only turn our attention to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition of thoſe nations which are not yet emerged from a ſtate of barbariſm, where the uſes of the Dog are but little known or attended to, and we will find that they lead a precarious and wretched life of perpetual warfare with the ſtill more ſavage inhabitants of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, with which they are obliged to diſpute the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their uncultivated fields, and divide with them the fruits of their labours.—From hence we may conclude, that the attention of mankind, in the earlieſt ages, would be engaged in training and rendering this animal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the important purpoſes of domeſtic utility; and the reſult of this art has been the conqueſt and peaceable poſſeſſion of the earth.</p>
               <p>Of all animals, the Dog ſeems moſt ſuſceptible of change, and moſt eaſily modified by difference of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, food, and education; not only the figure of his body, but his faculties, habits, and diſpoſitions, vary in a ſurprizing manner. In the ſame country, one Dog dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers greatly from another; and in different climates, the very ſpecies ſeems to be changed. Nothing appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in theſe animals but their internal conformation, which is alike in all; in every other reſpect, they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſſimilar. They vary in ſize, in figure, in the length of the noſe and ſhape of the head, in the length and direction of the ears and tail, in the colour and quantity of the hair, &amp;c.—To enumerate the different kinds, or mark the diſcriminations by which each is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, would be a taſk as fruitleſs as it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; to account for this wonderful variety, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate

the character of the primitive ſtock from which they muſt all have ſprung, would be equally vain.—We have ſeen, in the hiſtory of the Cow and the Sheep, that thoſe animals which have been long under the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man, never preſerve the ſtamp of Nature in its original purity. In wild animals, which ſtill enjoy their original freedom from reſtraint, and have the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent choice of food and climate, this impreſſion is ſtill faithfully preſerved; but thoſe which man has ſubdued, tranſported from climate to climate, changed their food, habits, and manner of living, muſt neceſſarily have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the greateſt alterations in their form; and as the Dog, of all other domeſtic animals, is moſt accuſtomed to this influence, is endowed with diſpoſitions the moſt docile and obedient, is ſuſceptible of every impreſſion, and ſubmiſſive to every reſtraint, we need not wonder that he ſhould be ſubject to the greateſt variety.—To an attentive obſerver of the canine race, it is truly wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and curious to obſerve the rapid changes and ſingular combinations of forms, ariſing from promiſcuous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which every-where preſent themſelves: They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in endleſs ſucceſſion, and ſeem more like the effect of whimſical caprice than the regular and uniform pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Nature: So that, in whatever light we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the various mixtures which at preſent abound, and render every idea of a ſyſtematic arrangement dubious and problematical, we may fairly preſume, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Dog would be firſt required in maintaining and preſerving the ſuperiority of man over thoſe animals which were deſtined for his ſupport.—We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begin with</p>

               <p>This uſeful animal, ever faithful to his charge, reigns at the head of the flock; where it is better heard, and more attended to, than even the voice of the ſhepherd. Safety, order, and diſcipline, are the fruits of his vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and activity.</p>
               <p>In thoſe large tracts of land which, in many parts of our iſland, are ſolely appropriated to the feeding of Sheep and other cattle, this ſagacious animal is of the utmoſt importance. Immenſe flocks may be ſeen conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ranging over thoſe extenſive wilds, as far as the eye can reach, ſeemingly without controul: Their only guide is the ſhepherd, attended by his faithful Dog, the conſtant companion of his toils: It receives his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and is always prompt to execute them; it is the watchful guardian of the flock, prevents them from ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, keeps them together, and conducts them from one part of their paſture to another; it will not ſuffer any ſtrangers to mix with them, but carefully keeps off every intruder. In driving a number of Sheep to any diſtant part, a well-trained Dog never fails to confine them to

the road, watches every avenue that leads from it; where he takes his ſtand, threatening every delinquent: He purſues the ſtragglers, if any ſhould eſcape; and forces them into order, without doing them the leaſt injury. If the herdſman be obliged to leave them, he depends upon his Dog to keep the flock together; and as ſoon as he hears the well-known ſignal, this faithful creature conducts them to his maſter, though at a conſiderable diſtance.</p>
               <p>There is a very remarkable ſingularity in the feet of the Shepherd's Dog: All of them have one, and ſome two toes more than other Dogs, though they ſeem not to be of much uſe. They appear to be deſtitute of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and hang dangling at the hind part of the leg more like an unnatural excreſcence than a neceſſary part of the animal.

               <p>This breed of Dogs, at preſent, appears to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in the greateſt purity, in the northern parts of Scotland; where its aid is highly neceſſary in managing the numerous herds of Sheep bred in thoſe extenſive wilds.</p>

               <p>is a truſty and uſeful ſervant to the farmer and grazier; and, although it is not taken notice of by naturaliſts as a diſtinct race, yet it is now ſo generally uſed, eſpecially in the North of England, and ſuch great attention is paid in breeding it, that we cannot help conſidering it as a permanent kind. They are chiefly employed in driving cattle; in which way they are extremely uſeful. They are larger, ſtronger, and fiercer than the Shepherd's Dog; and their hair is ſmoother and ſhorter. They are moſtly of a black and white colour. Their ears are half-prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and many of them are whelped with ſhort tails, which ſeem as if they had been cut: Theſe are called <hi>Self-tailed Dogs.</hi> They bite very keenly; and as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make their attack at the heels, the cattle have no defence againſt them: In this way, they are more than a match for a Bull, which they quickly compel to run. Their ſagacity is uncommonly great: They know their maſter's fields, and are ſingularly attentive to the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0209200900:294"/>
that are in them: A good Dog watches, goes his rounds; and, if any ſtrange cattle ſhould happen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amongſt the herd, although unbidden, he quickly flies at them, and with keen bites obliges them to depart.</p>
               <p>Similar to the Cur, is that which is commonly uſed in driving cattle to the ſlaughter; and as theſe Dogs have frequently to go long journies, great ſtrength, as well as ſwiftneſs, is required for that purpoſe: They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally of a mixed kind; and unite in them the ſeveral qualities of the Shepherd's Dog, the Cur, the Maſtiff, and the Greyhound. Thus, by a judicious mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of different kinds, the ſervices of the Dog are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtill more various and extenſive, and the great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of domeſtic utility are more fully anſwered.</p>

The Pomeranian or Wolf Dog of M. Buffon, the Siberian, Lapland, and Iceland Dogs are ſomewhat ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to it in the ſharpneſs of their muzzles, in their long ſhaggy hair, and buſhy curling tails. The principal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in their ſize. Though much larger, they all of them have ſome reſemblance to the Shepherd's Dog.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the Greenland Dogs are white; but ſome are ſpotted, and ſome black. They may rather be ſaid to howl than bark. The Greenlanders ſometimes eat their fleſh: They make garments of their ſkins, and uſe them in drawing ſledges; to which they yoke them, four, five, and ſometimes ſix together<note n="*" place="bottom">Five of theſe Dogs, that had eſcaped with their trappings, were found in Greenland, and brought to this country a few years ago by one of our ſhips in the fiſhery.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Dogs of Kamſchatka are commonly black or white. They are ſtrong, nimble, and active; and are very uſeful in drawing ſledges, the only method of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in that dreary country during the winter. They travel with great expedition. Captain King relates, that, during his ſtay there, a courier with diſpatches, drawn by them, performed a journey of 270 miles in leſs than four days. The ſledges are uſually drawn by five Dogs, four of them yoked two and two abreaſt: The foremoſt acts as a leader to the reſt. The reins being faſtened to a collar round the leading Dog's neck, are of little uſe in directing the pack; the driver depending chiefly upon their obedience to his voice, with which he animates them to proceed. Great care and attention are conſequently uſed in training up thoſe for leaders, which are more valuable according to their ſteadineſs and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility; the ſum of forty roubles, or ten pounds, being
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0209200900:296"/>
no unuſual price for one of them.—The rider has a crooked ſtick, anſwering the purpoſe both of whip and reins; with which, by ſtriking on the ſnow, he regulates the ſpeed of the Dogs, or ſtops them at his pleaſure. When they are inattentive to their duty, he often chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes them by throwing it at them. He diſcovers great dexterity in regaining his ſtick, which is the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty attending his ſituation; for if he ſhould happen to loſe his ſtick, the Dogs immediately diſcover the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſeldom fail to ſet off at full ſpeed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to run till their ſtrength is exhauſted, or till the carriage is overturned, and daſhed to pieces, or hurried down a precipice.</p>
               <note n="*⁎*" place="bottom">In December, 1784, one of theſe Dogs was left by a ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling veſſel near Boomer, on the coaſt of Northumberland; finding himſelf deſerted, he began to worry Sheep, and in that way did ſo much damage, that he became the terror of the country within a circuit of above twenty miles. We are aſſured, that when he caught a Sheep, he bit a hole in its right ſide, and after eating the tallow about the kidneys, left it; ſeveral of them thus lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were found alive by the ſhepherds, and being taken proper care of, ſome of them recovered, and afterwards had Lambs.— From his delicacy in this reſpect, the deſtruction he made may in ſome meaſure be conceived, as it may be ſuppoſed that the fat of one Sheep in a day would hardly ſatisfy his hunger. The farmers were ſo much alarmed by his depredations, that various means were uſed for his deſtruction. They frequently purſued him with Hounds, Greyhounds, &amp;c. but when the Dogs came up with him, he laid down on his back, as if ſupplicating for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and in that poſition they never hurt him; he therefore laid quietly, taking his reſt till the hunters approached, when he made off without being followed by the Hounds, till they were again excited to the purſuit, which always terminated unſucceſsfully.— And it is worthy of notice, that he was one day purſued from Howick to upwards of thirty miles diſtance, but returned thither, and killed Sheep the ſame evening. In March, 1785, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſidence during the day was upon a rock, on the Heugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, near Howick, where he had a view of four roads that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it; and after many fruitleſs attempts, he was at laſt ſhot there.</note>

               <p>is the fierceſt of all the Dog kind, and is probably the moſt courageous creature in the world. It is low in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but very ſtrong and well-built. Its noſe is ſhort, and the under jaw projects beyond the upper, which gives it a fierce and unpleaſing aſpect.—Its courage in attacking the Bull is well known: Its fury i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſeizing, and its invincible obſtinacy in maintaining its hold, are truly aſtoniſhing. It always aims at the front; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally faſtens upon the lip, the tongue, the eye, or ſome part of the face; where it hangs, in ſpite of every effort of the Bull to diſengage himſelf.</p>
               <p>The uncommon ardour of theſe Dogs in fighting will be beſt illuſtrated by the following fact, related by an eye-witneſs; which at the ſame time corroborates, in ſome degree, that wonderful account of the Dogs of Epirus, given by Elian, and quoted by Dr Goldſmith in his hiſtory of the Dog. — Some years ago, at a bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baiting in the North of England, when that barbarous cuſtom was very common, a young man, confident of the courage of his Dog, laid ſome trifling wagers, that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0209200900:298"/>
he would, at ſeparate times, cut off all the four feet of his Dog; and that, after every amputation, it would attack the Bull. The cruel experiment was tried, and the Dog continued to ſeize the Bull as eagerly as if he had been perfectly whole.</p>
               <p>Of late years, this inhuman cuſtom of baiting the Bull has been almoſt entirely laid aſide in the North of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and, conſequently, there are now few of this kind of Dogs to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>As the Bull Dog always makes his attack without barking, it is very dangerous to approach him alone, without the greateſt precaution.</p>

depredations whilſt in his cuſtody. Confined during the day, as ſoon as the gates are locked, he is left to range at full liberty: He then goes round the premiſſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines every part of them, and by loud barkings gives notice that he is ready to defend his charge.</p>
               <p>Dr Caius, in his curious treatiſe on Britiſh Dogs, tells us, that three of theſe animals were reckoned a match for a Bear, and four for a Lion.</p>
               <p>We have a curious account, recorded in Stow's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, of an engagement between three Maſtiffs and a Lion, in the preſence of James the Firſt. "One of the Dogs being put into the den, was ſoon diſabled by the Lion; which took it by the head and neck, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it about: Another Dog was then let looſe, and ſerved in the ſame manner: But the third being put in, immediately ſeized the Lion by the lip, and held him for a conſiderable time; till being ſeverely torn by his claws, the Dog was obliged to quit its hold; and the Lion, greatly exhauſted in the conflict, refuſed to renew the engagement; but taking a ſudden leap over the Docs, fled into the interior part of his den. Two of the Dogs ſoon died of their wounds: The laſt ſurvived, and was taken great care of by the king's ſon; who ſaid, "he that had fought with the king of beaſts, "hould never after fight with any inferior creature."</p>
               <p>The Maſtiffs of Great-Britain were noted in the time of the Roman emperors; who appointed an officer, whoſe ſole buſineſs it was to breed, and ſend from hence, ſuch as would prove equal to the combats of the amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre.</p>
               <p>The following anecdote will ſhew, that the Maſtiff, conſcious of its ſuperior ſtrength, knows kow to chaſtiſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0209200900:300"/>
the impertinence of an inferior:—A large Dog of this kind, belonging to the late M.

               <p>There are varieties of this animal, ſome of which are produced by a mixture with the Bull Dog.—The <hi>Ban-Dog</hi> is lighter, ſmaller, more active, and leſs powerful than the Maſtiff; its noſe is ſmaller and ſiner, and its hair rougher. It is, notwithſtanding, very fierce, and employed in the ſame uſeful purpoſes as the Maſtiff.</p>

               <p>The HARRIER is nimble and vigorous, and purſues the Hare with the moſt impetuous eagerneſs, gives her no time to breathe nor double; and the moſt eager ſportſmen generally find it ſufficient exerciſe to keep in with their ſpeed.

This propenſity appears to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in the nation; and no price ſeems now thought too great for Hounds of known excellence<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1788, Mr Noel's pack was ſold to Sir Wm Lowther, Bart. for 1000 guineas.</note>. The Fox-hounds generally preferred are tall, light-made, but ſtrong, and poſſeſſed of great courage, ſpeed, and activity.</p>

Dogs of the ſame kind are alſo trained to the hunting of the Stag and other Deer. The following anecdote affords a proof of their wonderful ſpirit in ſupporting a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of exertion:—</p>
               <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                  <p>Some years ſince, a very large Stag was turned out of Whinfield Park, in the county of Weſtmoreland, and purſued by the hounds of the Right Hon. the Earl of Thanet, till, by fatigue or accident, the whole pack were thrown out, except two ſtaunch and favourite Dogs, which continued the chaſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the day; the Stag returned to the park from whence he ſet out, and, as his laſt effort, leapt the wall, and expired as ſoon as he had accompliſhed it. One of the Hounds purſued to the wall, but being unable to get over it, laid down, and almoſt immediately expired; the other was alſo found dead at a ſmall diſtance.</p>
                  <p>The length of the chaſe is uncertain; but as they were ſeen at Red-kirks, near Annan, in Scotland, diſtant, by the poſt-road, about forty-ſix miles, it is conjectured that the circuitous and uneven courſe they might be ſuppoſed to take, would not be leſs than <hi>one hundred and twenty miles.</hi> To commemorate this fact, the horns of the Stag, which were the largeſt ever ſeen in that part of the country, were placed on a tree of a moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſize, in the park, (afterwards called the Hart-horn tree) accompanied with this inſcription:—</p>

               <p>is deſcribed by Whitaker, in his Hiſtory of Mancheſter, as the original breed of this iſland, uſed by the ancient Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons in the chaſe of the larger kinds of game, with which their country abounded at that time. This valuable Hound is diſtinguiſhed by its great ſize and ſtrength; its body is long, its cheſt deep, its ears long and ſweeping, and the tone of its voice is peculiarly deep and mellow. From the particular formation of its organs, or from the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary moiſture that always adheres to its noſe and lips, or perhaps from ſome other unknown cauſe, it is endued with the moſt exquiſite ſenſe of ſmelling, and can often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſcent an hour after the lighter Beagles have given it up. Their ſlowneſs alſo diſpoſes them to receive the directions of the huntſman; but as they are able to hunt a cold ſcent, they are too apt to make it ſo, by their
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0209200900:311"/>
want of ſpeed, and tedious exactneſs. Theſe Dogs were once common in every part of this iſland, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly much larger than at preſent. The breed, which has been gradually declining, and its ſize ſtudiouſly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by a mixture of other kinds in order to increaſe its ſpeed, is now almoſt extinct. It ſeems to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately deſcribed by Shakeſpere, in the following lines:
<q>
                     <l>My Hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,</l>
                     <l>So flewed, ſo ſanded, and their heads are hung</l>

               <p>was in great requeſt with our anceſtors; and as it was remarkable for the fineneſs of its ſcent, it was frequently employed in recovering game that had eſcaped wounded from the hunter. It could follow, with great certainty, the footſteps of a man to a conſiderable diſtance; and in barbarous and uncivilized times, when the thief or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer had fled, this uſeful creature would trace him through the moſt ſecret and thickeſt coverts, nor would it ceaſe its purſuit till it had taken the felon; for this reaſon there was a law in Scotland, that whoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied entrance to one of theſe Dogs, in purſuit of ſtolen goods, ſhould be deemed an acceſſary. But, as the arm of juſtice is now extended over every part of the country, and there are no ſecret receſſes where villainy may lay concealed, theſe ſervices are no longer neceſſary. In

               <p>The Blood-hound is taller than the Old Engliſh Hound, moſt beautifully formed, and ſuperior to every other kind in activity, ſpeed, and ſagacity. They ſeldom bark, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the chaſe; and are commonly of a reddiſh or brown colour.</p>

                  <figure/> THE NEWFOUNDLAND DOG.</head>
               <p>The drawing of this Dog was taken from a very fine one at Eſlington, in the county of Northumberland; its dimenſions were as follow:—From its noſe to the end of its tail, it meaſured ſix feet two inches; the length of its tail one foot ten inches; from one fore-foot right over its ſhoulders to the other, five feet ſeven inches; girt behind the ſhoulder, three feet two inches; round its head over its ears, two feet; round the upper part of its fore-leg, nine inches and a half. It is web-footed, can ſwim extremely faſt, dive with great eaſe, and bring up any thing from the bottom of the water. It is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of fiſh, and eats raw trouts, or other ſmall fiſh, out of the nets.</p>
               <p>This breed of Dogs was originally brought from the country of which they bear the name, where their great
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0209200900:314"/>
ſtrength and docility render them extremely uſeful to the fiſhers on thoſe coaſts, who uſe them in bringing down wood from the interior parts of the country to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; three or four of them yoked to a ſledge, will draw two or three hundred weight of wood piled upon it, for ſeveral miles, with great eaſe; they are not attended with a driver nor any perſon to guide them, but after having delivered their loading, they return immediately to the woods, where they are accuſtomed to be fed with dried fiſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The extraordinary ſagacity of theſe Dogs, and their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their maſters, render them highly valuable in particular ſituations. Among the innumerable inſtances, wherein they have diſplayed thoſe faculties, the following anecdotes appear to be not unworthy of notice:—</p>
               <p>During a ſevere ſtorm, in the winter of 1789, a ſhip, belonging to Newcaſtle, was loſt near Yarmouth, and a Newfoundland Dog alone eſcaped to the ſhore, bringing in his mouth the captain's pocket-book; he landed amidſt a number of people that were aſſembled, ſeveral of whom in vain endeavoured to take it from him. The ſagacious animal, as if ſenſible of the importance of the charge, which in all probability was delivered to him by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing maſter, at length leaped fawningly againſt the breaſt of a man, who had attracted his notice among the crowd, and delivered the book to him. The Dog im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately returned to the place where he had landed, and watched with great attention for every thing that came from the wrecked veſſel, ſeizing them, and endeavouring to bring them to land.</p>
               <p>The following is another inſtance of their great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and ſtrength of obſervation:—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0209200900:315"/>A gentleman walking by the ſide of the river Tyne, and obſerving, on the oppoſite ſide, a child fall into the water, gave notice to his Dog, which immediately jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, ſwam over, and, catching hold of the child with its mouth, brought it ſafe to land.</p>

It is frequently kept on board of veſſels for the purpoſe of taking up birds that are ſhot, and drop into the ſea; and, from its aptneſs to fetch and carry, it is uſeful in recovering any thing that has fallen overboard.</p>

which is generally long-bodied, has ſhort crooked legs, its tail curled upon its back, and is frequently ſpotted with black upon a blue-grey ground. It is peculiar in the colour of its eyes; the ſame Dog often having the iris of one eye black, and the other white.</p>
               <p>It is a bold, vigilant, and ſpirited little Dog: At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, however, its ſervices ſeem but little attended to; a more certain method of doing the buſineſs of the ſpit having ſuperſeded the labours of this induſtrious animal.</p>

               <head>THE PUG DOG,</head>
               <p>in outward appearance, is every way formed like the Bull-Dog; but much ſmaller, and its tail curled upon its back.—It was formerly very common in many parts of England; however, at preſent, it is rarely to be met with. Although it has no longer its admirers here, Mrs Piozzi informs us, that ſhe ſaw great numbers at Padua, in Italy; and that it ſtill maintains its place in the favour of the fair-ones of that country.</p>
               <p>That all theſe, however divided, compoſe one general family, is apparent, from the facility with which they intermix, produce, and re-produce. In all of them the ſame attachment to mankind, the ſame pliant and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition, ſubmitting with patience to the various indignities to which they are expoſed by their dependant ſituation, is eminently obſervable: Even thoſe that, by accident or neglect, have been abandoned and become wild, when taken home, are eaſily reclaimed by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and attention: They quickly become familiar, and continue faithfully attached to their maſters.—Multitudes of theſe are to be found in South-America, which have ſprung from thoſe taken thither by the Europeans. They breed in holes like Rabbits, are formed ſomewhat like a Greyhound, have erect ears, are very vigilant, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the chaſe.—Thus we find, that the attachment of the Dog to mankind is ſpontaneous; and, when once engaged, it ſeems beyond the power of ill uſage to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due thoſe inherent qualities.</p>
               <p>To mention ſome of the more common inſtances of this creature's ſagacity, by way of elucidating its general
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0209200900:325"/>
character, may not be amiſs; and amongſt theſe, its care in directing the ſteps of the blind man is not the leaſt worthy of notice. There are few who have not ſeen an unfortunate object of this deſcription led by his Dog, through the various paſſages of a populous town, to the accuſtomed place where he fits to ſupplicate the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of paſſengers. It may ſometimes be ſeen to ſtop at particular houſes, to receive the morſel from the hand of charity, or pick from the ground the money thrown out to relieve him. When the day is paſſed, it conducts him home again; and gratefully receives, as the reward of its ſervices, the ſcanty pittance which poverty and wretchedneſs can beſtow.</p>
               <p>Dogs will ſometimes imitate the actions of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will open a door that is faſtened with a latch, or pull a bell, where they are deſirous of gaining admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.—Faber mentions one, belonging to a nobleman of the Medici family, which always attended at its maſter's table, took from him his plates, and brought him others; and, if he wanted wine, would carry it to him, in a glaſs placed upon a ſilver plate, which it held in its mouth, without ſpilling the ſmalleſt drop. The ſame Dog would alſo hold the ſtirrups in its teeth, whilſt its maſter was mounting his horſe.</p>
               <p>That theſe animals are capable of mutual attachment, is evident, from the well-known ſtory of the Dog at St Alban's; which, being left by its maſter at an inn there till he returned from London, and being ill-treated by a large Dog belonging to the houſe, ſtole privately off; and returning again with a friend, that was much larger and ſtronger than itſelf, they both fell upon the aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0209200900:326"/>
and puniſhed him ſeverely for his cruelty to a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral peculiarities common to all animals of the Dog kind, briefly mentioned by Linnaeus, with which we ſhall conclude its hiſtory; the principal of which are as follow:—The Dog is carnivorous; its ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach digeſts bones; it eats graſs for a vomit; voids its urine ſideways, and commonly where other Dogs have done ſo before; ſmells at a ſtranger; ſcarcely ever ſweats, but lolls out its tongue when hot; remembers injuries done to it; is ſubject to the hydrophobia; its ſenſe of hearing very quick; when aſleep, is ſuppoſed to dream; goes with young ſixty-three days, and commonly brings forth from four to eight at one time. It barks at ſtrange Dogs, ſnaps at a ſtone thrown at it, howls at certain mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical notes: When about to lie down, frequently goes round the place; fawns at the approach of its maſter, and will not patiently ſuffer any one to ſtrike him; runs before him on a journey, often going over the ſame ground; on coming to croſs ways, ſtops, looks back, and waits to obſerve which of them he takes; ſits up and begs; and, when it has committed a theft, ſlinks away with its tail between its legs; is an enemy to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars and ill-looking people, and attacks them without the leaſt provocation; is alſo ſaid to be ſick at the approach of bad weather.—We cannot, however, agree with the learned naturaliſt, when he aſſerts, that the male pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies reſemble the Dog, and the female the Bitch; or that it is a character common to the whole ſpecies, that the tail always bends to the left ſide. To theſe we may add, as equally void of foundation, a remark of M. Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, that a female Hound, covered with a Dog of her
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0209200900:327"/>
own kind, has been known to produce a mixed race, conſiſting of Hounds and Terriers.—We barely mention theſe, to ſhew, that too much caution cannot be uſed in forming general characters or ſyſtematic arrangements; and we leave it to the experience of the moſt inattentive obſerver to detect ſuch palpable abſurdities.</p>

                  <figure/> THE HARE.</head>
               <p>THIS harmleſs and inoffenſive animal, deſtitute of every means of defence, and ſurrounded on all ſides by its enemies, would ſoon be utterly extirpated, if Nature, ever kind and provident, had not endowed it with faculties, by which it is frequently enabled to evade their purſuit.</p>
               <p>Fearful of every danger, and attentive to every alarm, the Hare is continually upon the watch; and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with very long ears, moveable at pleaſure, and eaſily directed to every quarter, is warned of the moſt diſtant approaches of danger. Its eyes are large and prominent, adapted to receive the rays of light on every ſide, and give notice of more immediate alarms. To theſe may be added its great ſwiftneſs, by which it ſoon leaves moſt of its purſuers far behind.—The hind are much longer than the fore legs, and are furniſhed with ſtrong muſcles, which give the Hare a ſingular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in running againſt a hill; and, as if ſenſible of its
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0209200900:329"/>
powers in this reſpect, it is always obſerved to fly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards riſing ground when firſt ſtarted.</p>
               <p>It is curious to obſerve how admirably every limb and member of this creature is formed for ſpeed.—Thus made for eſcape, the Hare might be ſuppoſed to enjoy a ſtate of tolerable ſecurity; but as every rapacious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is its enemy, it is ſeldom permitted to live out its natural term. Dogs and Foxes purſue it by inſtinct; Wild Cats, and Weaſels of all kinds, catch and devour it; birds of prey are ſtill more dangerous enemies; whilſt man, far more powerful than all, makes uſe of every artifice to obtain an animal which conſtitutes one of the numerous delicacies of his table.—If we were to enumerate the various ſtratagems which ingenuity has ſuggeſted to circumvent this perſecuted creature, we would willingly omit the notable atchievements and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant exploits of the chaſe; which, to a cool and diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate obſerver, ſeem to demand a nobler game.</p>
               <q>Poor is the triumph o'er the timid Hare.</q>
               <p>Another remarkable means of ſafety to the Hare is its colour, which being ſimilar to the ground where it ſits, ſecures it from the ſight of its enemies; and, as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of the care of Providence in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its creatures, theſe, as well as ſome other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in more northern regions, are obſerved to change their colour and become perfectly white during winter, which renders them leſs conſpicuous in the ſnow.—Some rare inſtances occur, of white Hares being met with in Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>The Hare is a very prolific animal, and breeds three or four times in the year. The females go with young
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0209200900:330"/>
thirty days, and generally bring forth three or four at a litter. The rutting ſeaſon begins in February.</p>
               <p>During the day, Hares ſleep or repoſe in their ſeats, and ſeldom remove from them: The night is the ſeaſon when they go about in ſearch of food; and they are ſure to return to their forms or ſeats by the ſame paths which they took in leaving them.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>'Tis inſtinct that directs the jealous Hare</l>
                  <l>To chuſe her ſoft abode. With ſtep revers'd,</l>
                  <l>She forms the doubling maze; then, ere the morn</l>
                  <l>Peeps through the clouds, leaps to her cloſe receſs.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The fur of the Hare is of great uſe in making hats; for which purpoſe many thouſands of their ſkins are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually imported from Ruſſia.</p>
               <p>The Hare was reckoned a great delicacy among the Romans; but was forbidden to the Jews, and held ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred among the ancient Britons, who religiouſly abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from eating it.—We are told, that Boadicea, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before her laſt conflict with the Romans, let looſe a Hare ſhe had concealed in her boſom; which, taking what was deemed a fortunate courſe, was looked upon as a good omen.—It is to this day deemed unclean by the Mahometans.</p>
               <p>The Hare is found in moſt parts of the world, with very little variety. Thoſe of North-America are rather leſs than the European, frequent marſhes and meadows, and when purſued take refuge in hollow trees.</p>

               <p>is grey in ſummer, with a ſlight mixture of black and tawny. Its hair is ſoft; its ears ſhorter, and its legs more ſlender, than the common Hare's.—In winter, the whole body changes to a ſnowy whiteneſs, except the tips and edges of the ears, which remain black.</p>
               <p>This animal lives on the higheſt hills in Scotland, Norway, Lapland, Ruſſia, and Siberia; never deſcends from the mountains, nor mixes with the common Hare, although they abound in the ſame parts. It does not run faſt; and, when purſued, often takes ſhelter in clefts of rocks. It is eaſily tamed, is very frolicſome, and fond of honey and other ſweets. It changes its colour in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, and reſumes its grey coat in April.—Troops of five or ſix hundred are ſometimes ſeen, which migrate towards the South in ſpring, and return in autumn.</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the great ſimilarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Hare and the Rabbit, Nature has placed an inſeparable bar between them, in not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to intermix, to which they mutually diſcover the moſt extreme averſion: Beſides this, there is a wide difference in their habits and propenſities: The Rabbit lives in holes in the earth, where it brings forth its young, and retires from the approach of danger; whilſt the Hare prefers the open fields, and truſts to its ſpeed for ſafety.</p>
               <p>The fecundity of the Rabbit is truly aſtoniſhing: It breeds ſeven times in the year, and generally produces eight young at a time; from which it is calculated, that one pair may increaſe, in the courſe of four years, to the amazing number of 1,274,840: So that, if frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions were not made in various ways, there is reaſon to apprehend they would ſoon exceed the means of their ſupport, and over-run the face of the country. But as their increaſe is great, ſo is the number of their enemies; for, beſides thoſe that are taken for the uſe of man, great
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0209200900:333"/>
numbers are devoured by Foxes, Weaſels, Foumarts, and other beaſts of prey.—In Spain, they formerly increaſed to ſuch a degree, as to become obnoxious; and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were obliged to procure Ferrets from Africa to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>The Rabbit is capable of procreating at the age of five or ſix months. The female goes with young about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days. Previous to her bringing forth, ſhe makes a bed with down, that ſhe pulls off her own coat. She ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves her young but when preſſed with hunger, and returns as ſoon as that is allayed, which ſhe does with ſurprizing quickneſs. During the time ſhe tends and ſuckles her young, ſhe carefully conceals them from the male, leſt he ſhould devour them; and frequently covers up the mouth of the hole, that her retreat may not be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The Rabbit lives to the age of eight or nine years, and prefers warm and temperate climates.—Pliny and Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle mention it as being anciently known only in Greece and Spain; it is now, however, common in various parts of Europe.—In Sweden and other cold countries, it can only be reared in houſes.</p>
               <p>This animal abounds in Great-Britain, where its ſkin forms a very conſiderable article in the manufacture of hats. Lincolnſhire, Norfolk, and Cambridgeſhire, are moſt noted for the production of them.</p>

               <p>is of various colours—white, brown, black, and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. It is ſomewhat larger than the wild Rabbit; but its fleſh is not ſo good, being ſofter and more inſipid. Its food is generally cabbage leaves, colewort, blades of corn, ſour-dock, and other ſucculent plants; but ſweet ſhort hay, with a little clean oats, make the beſt diet.</p>
               <p>The RABBIT OF ANGORA, like the Goat and Sheep of that country, is covered with long hair, which falls down its ſide in wavy curls, and is of a ſilky ſineneſs.</p>
               <p>In Ruſſia, there is a very remarkable variety of the Rabbit, having a double ſkin over the back, into which it can withdraw its head: It likewiſe conceals its fore legs in a part which falls down under the throat. There are ſmall holes in this looſe ſkin on the back, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit light to the eyes. The colour of the body is cinere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that of the head and ears is brown.—A manuſcript account of this animal, with a drawing by Mr G. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is preſerved in the Britiſh Muſeum.</p>
               <p>The Rabbit is not a native of America. There are great numbers of them in many of the Weſt-India iſlands, which have originated from a ſtock carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Europe.</p>

They have neither beauty nor utility to recommend them; their ſkins are of little value; and their fleſh, though eatable, is far from being good. Their habits and diſpoſition are equally unpleaſant and diſguſting: Void of attachment even to their own offspring, they ſuffer them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the moment they are brought forth, without making the ſmalleſt attempt to defend them. The males frequently deſtroy their own young; and are ſo ſtupid, as to allow themſelves to be killed by Cats, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. They paſs their whole lives in ſleeping, eating, and in the propagation of their ſpecies. They are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gentle and tame; they do no miſchief, but ſeem to be equally incapable of good.—Rats are ſaid to avoid the places where they reſide.</p>
               <p>The Guinea-Pig is conſiderably leſs than the Rabbit; its upper lip is only half divided; it has two cutting-teeth in each jaw; large and broad ears; its hair is of

different colours—white, varied with orange and black in irregular patches; has no tail; is a reſtleſs animal; feeds on bread, grain, and vegetables; and makes a noiſe like the grunting of a Pig.</p>
               <p>This creature is capable of breeding at the age of two months, produces from four to twelve at one time; and the ſpecies would be innumerable, if many of them were not taken off by various means: Some are killed by Cats; others by the males; and more, both young and old, periſh by the ſeverity of the climate, and want of proper care.</p>

                  <figure/> THE SQUIRREL.</head>
               <p>THIS beautiful little animal is equally admirable for the neatneſs and elegance of its formation, as for its livelineſs and activity. Its diſpoſition is gentle and harmleſs; though naturally wild, it is ſoon familiariſed to confinement and reſtraint; and though exceſſively ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, it is eaſily taught to receive with freedom the moſt familiar careſſes from the hand that feeds it. It uſually lives in woods, and makes its neſt of moſs or dry leaves in the hollows of trees; it ſeldom deſcends upon the ground, but leaps from tree to tree with great agility. Its food conſiſts of fruits, almonds, nuts, acorns, &amp;c. of which it accumulates great ſtores for winter proviſions, and ſecures them carefully near its neſt. In the ſummer it feeds on buds and young ſhoots, and is particularly fond of the cones of the fir and pine trees. The ſpring is the ſeaſon of love with Squirrels; at that time the males purſue the females, and exhibit wonderful proofs of agility, whilſt the latter, as if to make trial of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0209200900:341"/>
of their lovers, ſeem to avoid them by a variety of entertaining ſallies, and, like true coquets, feign an eſcape, by way of enhancing the value of the conqueſt. They bring forth four or five young at a time.</p>
               <p>The Squirrel is of a bright-brown colour, inclining to red; the breaſt and belly are white; the ears are orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with long tufts of hair; the eyes are large, black, and lively; the fore teeth ſtrong and ſharp; the fore legs are curiouſly furniſhed with long ſtiff hairs, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on each ſide like whiſkers. When it eats it ſits erect, and uſes its fore paws as hands to convey food to its mouth. The tail of the Squirrel is its greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſerves as a defence from the cold, being large enough to cover the whole body; it likewiſe aſſiſts it in taking leaps from one tree to another; and we may add a third application of it, which would ſeem altogether improbable, if we were not aſſured of it by Linnaeus and other naturaliſts:—In attempting to croſs a lake or river, the Squirrel places itſelf upon a piece of bark, and, erecting its tail to catch the wind, boldly commits itſelf to the mercy of the waves. The ſmalleſt guſt of wind is ſufficient to overſet a whole navy of theſe little adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and in ſuch perilous voyages many hundreds of them are ſaid to periſh.</p>
               <p>Of the Squirrel there are ſeveral varieties, ſome of which are to be found in almoſt every country; but they chiefly abound in northern and temperate climates. The Hudſon's-Bay Squirrel is ſmaller than the European; it is marked along the middle of the back with a duſky line, from head to tail; the belly is of a pale-aſh colour, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttled with black; and the tail, which is duſky and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0209200900:342"/>
barred with black, is not ſo long, nor ſo full of hair, as the common kind.</p>
               <p>The GREY SQUIRREL is about the ſize of a young Rabbit; its ears are ſhort, and not tufted at the ends; its hair is grey, mixed with black; on each ſide there is a red ſtreak which runs lengthways; its tail is long and buſhy, of a grey colour, variegated with black and white. It is common to both continents; in Sweden and other northern countries it changes its colour in the winter. It is very numerous in North-America, and does incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble damage to the plantations; great flocks of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the mountains, and lay waſte the fields of maize, by eating the young ears. A reward of three-pence per head was given for every one that was killed; and ſuch numbers were deſtroyed in one year, that Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania alone paid in rewards the ſum of 8000 l. of its currency.</p>
               <p>The Grey Squirrel makes its neſt in hollow trees, with moſs, ſtraw, wool, &amp;c. It lays up ſtores of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in holes made in the ground, which it viſits occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally when in want of meat: Theſe are often deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Swine; and ſometimes ſo long covered with ſnow, that the Squirrels periſh for want of food. They are not eaſily ſhot, but evade the gun with great quickneſs the moment they ſee it levelled. They are eaſily tamed; and their fleſh is eſteemed very delicate.</p>
               <p>The fur of theſe animals is very valuable, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported under the name of <hi>petit-gris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The BLACK SQUIRREL is about the ſame ſize and form with the laſt, but its tail is not ſo long: It is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally black, with white on the noſe, ears, and end of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0209200900:343"/>
the tail. Its diſpoſition and habits are ſo ſimilar to the Grey Squirrel, that it might be taken for a variety of that kind; but it is ſaid to aſſociate in ſeparate troops, and is equally numerous.</p>
               <p>This creature is found in the northern parts of Aſia, North-America, and Mexico. In the latter country, there is a variety with plain round ears; the upper part of the body variegated with black, white, and brown.— It is twice the ſize of the common Squirrel, lives under ground, where it brings forth its young, and lays in its ſtock of proviſions. It feeds on maize; and is extremely lively, gentle, and docile. It is the <hi>Coquallin</hi> of M. Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon.</p>

               <p>is very numerous in the foreſts of North-America, as well as the North of Aſia.—It burrows in the ground, and makes two entrances to its habitation; that if one ſhould be ſtopped up, it may have acceſs by the other. Its hole is formed with great ſkill, having ſeveral branches from the principal paſſage, each of which is terminated
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0209200900:344"/>
by a ſtore-houſe, in which its winter food is depoſited: In one is contained acorns, in another nuts, in a third maize, and in another cheſnuts, which are its favourite food.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals ſeldom ſtir out during winter, or ſo long as their proviſions laſt; when thoſe fail, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times work their way into places where apples are laid up, or into barns where maize is ſtored, and make great havock. During harveſt, they fill their mouths ſo full with corn, that their cheeks are quite diſtended, and carry it off to their concealed ſtore. They give great preference to certain kinds of food; and if, after filling their mouths with rye, they chance to meet with wheat, they diſcharge the former, that they may ſecure the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Ground Squirrel is marked with a ſtripe of black, which runs along the ridge of the back; and on each ſide a yellow ſtripe, bordered with black; its head, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and tail, are of a reddiſh-brown; breaſt and belly white; its noſe and feet of a pale-red colour; its eyes full and lively. It is very wild, bites ſeverely, and is tamed with difficulty. Its ſkin is of little value.</p>

It is about the ſize of the common Squirrel.</p>
               <p>Similar to this is the PALM SQUIRREL, having a pale-yellow ſtripe on the middle of the back, and two on each ſide parallel to it; the belly is of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; the reſt of the body black and red cloſely mixed; its tail is long, does not lie on its back like that of the Squirrel, but is carried erect.—Both theſe Squirrels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit Barbary and other hot countries.—They live chiefly in palm-trees, from whence the latter has its name.</p>

                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0209200900:346"/>The FAT SQUIRREL is found in France and the ſouthern parts of Europe. Its body is covered with ſoft hair, of an aſh colour; its belly whitiſh; its ears thin and naked. It is about ſix inches long, and thicker than the common Squirrel. It dwells chiefly in trees, leaps from bough to bough, feeds on fruits and acorns, and lodges in the hollows of trees. It remains in a torpid ſtate during winter, and grows very fat.—It was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a great delicacy among the Romans; who had places conſtructed on purpoſe to keep and feed them in, which they called <hi>gliraria.</hi>

               <p>The GREATER DORMOUSE, or GARDEN SQUIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REL, is rather leſs than the laſt mentioned. Its eyes are ſurrounded with a large black ſpot, which reaches to the ears; its body is of a tawny colour; its throat and belly white, tinged with yellow; its tail is long, and buſhy at the end.—It is common in the South of Europe, infeſts gardens, is particularly fond of peaches, and very deſtructive to all kinds of fruit. It lodges in holes in the walls, and brings forth five or ſix young at a time. It has a ſtrong odour, like a Rat; and, like the Fat Squirrel, remains torpid during the winter.</p>

It lays up ſtores of nuts, acorns, and beans; and retires at the approach of cold weather to its retreat, where it rolls itſelf up in a warm neſt, made of ſoft moſs, &amp;c. and remains in a torpid ſtate during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of winter.

               <p>is peculiarly diſtinguiſhed by a membranous continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſkin of the ſides and belly, which extends from the fore to the hind feet, and aſſiſts it greatly in making leaps from one tree to another, frequently at the diſtance of twenty or thirty yards. Its head is ſmall and round, and its upper lip cloven; its eyes are full, round, and black; and its ears ſmall and naked.</p>
               <p>This creature is found in all the northern regions, both of the old and new continents. It is more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in America than in Europe, is leſs than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Squirrel, lives in trees, and ſleeps in the day, but is extremely active during the night.</p>
               <p>In the act of leaping, the looſe ſkin is ſtretched out by the feet; whereby the ſurface of the body is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, the animal becomes lighter in proportion to its bulk, the acceleration of its fall is retarded, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to ſail or fly from one place to another. Where a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0209200900:349"/>
number of them are ſeen at a time leaping, they appear like leaves blown off by the wind.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral kinds, differing much in ſize.—In the iſlands of the Eaſt-Indies, there is a variety as large as a Hare, called the TAGUAN, or GREAT FLYING SQUIRREL; which perfectly reſembles the other in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and in the form of its lateral membrane. The head is ſmaller in proportion to the ſize of the body; the colour of the ſkin is dark-brown, mixed with white; the under part of the body whitiſh; the tail is brown, and grows gradually deeper towards the end, where it is black; the claws are long, thin, and hooked, like thoſe of a Cat, which enable it to keep hold where it happens to fall; it alſo catches hold with its tail, which is long and muſcular. It is a wild and timid animal. Its bite is ſo ſtrong, that it can make its eſcape from a wooden cage with great facility.</p>
               <p>A variety is found in Virginia, called by Mr Pennant the HOODED SQUIRREL; the lateral membrane begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the chin and ears, where it forms a kind of hood; and extending, like that of the former, from the fore to the hind legs: Its body is of a reddiſh colour ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <figure/> THE MARMOT</head>
               <p>HAS been placed by naturaliſts in the ſame claſs with the Hare and the Rat kind; and on exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining its parts, we find a partial agreement with both theſe animals. In its noſe and lips, as well as in the general form of its head, it reſembles the Hare; its ears are like thoſe of the Rat, with which it likewiſe agrees in the number and form of its teeth and claws. In other reſpects, it is no way ſimilar to either of thoſe kinds; and it is ſtill farther ſeparated from them by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes which ſeem peculiar to itſelf, and diſtinguiſh it from almoſt every other ſpecies of quadrupeds.</p>
               <p>The Marmot inhabits the higheſt regions of the Alps; it is likewiſe found in Poland, Ukraine, and Chineſe Tartary; is ſomewhat leſs than a Hare; its ears are round, and ſo ſhort, that they are almoſt hid in the fur; its tail is ſhort and buſhy; the hair on the back is of a browniſh-aſh colour; and that on the belly reddiſh, ſoft, and buſhy; its voice reſembles the murmuring of a young puppy; when irritated or frightened, it makes a whiſtling noiſe, very loud and piercing to the ear. It feeds on inſects, roots, and vegetables; but when tamed, is remarkably fond of milk and butter. It lives in holes,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0209200900:351"/>
formed with great art in the ſide of a mountain: There are two entrances to each; and the chamber to which they lead is deep and ſpacious; the bottom is lined with moſs and hay, of which theſe provident animals lay in a ſtore during ſummer; and, at the approach of winter, ſhut themſelves up in their holes by ſtopping the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances with earth, ſo effectually, that no diſcovery can be made of the place of their retreat. The chamber in which they lodge is large enough to contain a family of from five to a dozen Marmots: They roll themſelves up; and being well covered with hay, remain in a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſtate, inſenſible to the rigours of the ſeaſon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſecure from the ſtorm that rages without; till the chearing influence of the ſun again calls them out to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their exhauſted ſtrength, to propagate their kind, and provide for their future retreat. The torpid ſtate laſts from about Michaelmas till April. They go in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fat, but gradually waſte; and at the end of their long ſleep, they appear lean and extremely emaciated.</p>
               <p>The Marmot produces once a year; and the litter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſiſts of three or four.—When a number of them are feeding together, they place one as a centinel, which makes a whiſtling noiſe on the leaſt appearance of interruption; and the party immediately betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their holes, the centinel driving up the rear.</p>
               <p>The Marmot is a very playful animal, and is eaſily tamed. It learns to hold a ſtick, to dance, and to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit various geſtures: It will obey the voice of its maſter; and, like the Cat, has an antipathy to Dogs, which it attacks fiercely upon the leaſt irritation. It is very apt to gnaw linen or woollen ſtuffs: It often ſits upright, or walks with eaſe on its hind feet: It eats in the manner
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0209200900:352"/>
of a Squirrel, and carries its food to its mouth with its fore paws. Its fleſh is ſometimes eaten, but is always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a diſagreeable odour.</p>

               <p>is found in various parts of North-America, and ſeems to be the ſame with the Marmot of Canada, deſcribed by M.

Its fleſh is good and well taſted.</p>

                  <figure/> THE HAMSTER.</head>
               <p>Although the qualities of this animal are ſufficiently noxious to render it an object of univerſal deteſtation, in thoſe countries where it abounds; yet, when conſidered with regard to thoſe inſtincts which conduce to its own preſervation and ſupport, it well deſerves our higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Its habitation is curious, and conſtructed with great art: It conſiſts of a variety of apartments, adapted to various purpoſes, and extremely well fitted both for the comfort and convenience of the inhabitants. The firſt entrance is formed in an oblique direction, at the end of which the male ſinks a perpendicular hole, which he reſerves for his own uſe. The female makes ſeveral, for the accommodation of herſelf and family, that her young, during the ſhort time they are allowed to ſtay with her, may have a free paſſage to the general ſtores. One of the holes is lined with ſtraw, and ſerves as a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the others contain proviſions, of which great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities are always accumulated during the time of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. They begin to lay in their ſtores in Auguſt. To facilitate the tranſportation of their food, nature has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with two pouches in each cheek, into which they cram corn, beans, or peaſe, till they ſeem ready to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0209200900:355"/>
burſt; and, on their return to their holes, empty them, by preſſing their two fore feet againſt their cheeks. The quantity of proviſion found in theſe magazines, depends on the age or ſex of the inhabitants. The old Hamſters often amaſs an hundred pounds weight of grain, but the young and the females are ſatisfied with much leſs. At the approach of winter, the Hamſters retire into their ſubterraneous abodes, the entry to which they ſhut up with great care. There they remain in perfect tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and feed on their proviſions till the froſt becomes ſevere, when they ſink into a torpid ſtate, in which they continue till the return of ſpring. During this period, if any of the holes be opened, the Hamſter is always found lying upon a bed of ſoft ſtraw, with its head turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under its belly, between the two fore legs, whilſt the hind ones reſt upon the muzzle. Its eyes are ſhut, every member perfectly ſtiff, and ſenſation ſo totally ſuſpended, that neither reſpiration nor any other ſign of life can be perceived. When diſſected in this ſituation, the heart may be ſeen alternately contracting and dilating very ſlowly; the fat appears to be coagulated, and the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines are quite cold; during this operation the animal ſeems to feel very little, it ſometimes opens its mouth as if it wanted to reſpire, but the lethargy is too ſtrong to admit of its entirely awaking. The Hamſters copulate about the end of April, when the males enter the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the females, but remain only a few days. If two males happen to meet in the ſame hole, a furious combat enſues, which generally terminates in the death of the weaker. The females bring forth twice or thrice every year, each litter conſiſting of ſix or eight; in about three weeks the young are driven from their holes, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0209200900:356"/>
left to provide for themſelves. Their increaſe is ſo rapid in ſome years, as to be almoſt ſufficient to occaſion a dearth; but the ferocity with which they upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions attack and devour each other is ſo great, as to be the happy means of preventing the ill effects of their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity. It is not only its own ſpecies to which the fury of the Hamſter is directed; he attacks and devours every animal without diſtinction that he is able to conquer, and frequently oppoſes himſelf to enemies much ſuperior to himſelf in ſtrength.

               <p>The Hamſter is about the ſize of a large Water-Rat, has a ſhort tail almoſt naked; its colour on the head and back a reddiſh-brown, not unlike that of a Hare; its throat is white, and it has three white ſpots on each ſide; its breaſt and belly are black. It is found in various parts of Germany, Poland, and Ukraine. The Pole-Cat is its greateſt enemy; it purſues the Hamſter into its hole, and deſtroys great numbers. Mr Ray obſerves, that the hair of this animal is ſo cloſely united to the ſkin, that it cannot be pulled off without great difficulty; on which account it is held in high eſtimation.</p>

               <p>This wonderful animal, ſmall, weak, and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its appearance, is nevertheleſs truly formidable, from the numbers which ſometimes overſpread large tracts of country.</p>
               <p>Derived from a ſource which no naturaliſt has hitherto been able to explore, and attributed by ſuperſtitious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to the generation of the clouds, from whence they have been ſuppoſed to be poured down in ſhowers of rain, theſe animals appear at very uncertain periods, in Norway, Sweden, and Lapland; and like a torrent which nothing can reſiſt, their courſe is marked with ruin and deſolation. Myriads of them march in regular lines, about three feet aſunder, in a South-Eaſt direction. Neither fire nor water ſtops their progreſs: They go ſtraight forward with the moſt amazing perſeverance; they ſwim acroſs lakes and rivers; no oppoſition impedes them: If thouſands are deſtroyed, thouſands ſupply their places: The void is quickly filled up; and their number does not appear diminiſhed: They perſiſt in their courſe in ſpite of every obſtacle; and from the time they ſet out, never think of retreating; but if prevented from proceeding by any obſtacle, they either by aſſiduity ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0209200900:360"/>
it, or die in the attempt. Their march is moſtly in the night. They reſt during the day, and devour eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry root and vegetable they meet with. They infect the very herbage; and cattle are ſaid to periſh that feed upon the graſs they have touched.</p>
               <p>An enemy ſo numerous and deſtructive would ſoon render the countries they paſs through utterly uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable, did it not fortunately happen that the ſame rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that excites them to lay waſte the productions of the earth, at laſt impels them to deſtroy each other. Having nothing more to ſubſiſt on, they are ſaid to ſeparate into two armies, which engage with the moſt deadly hatred, and continue fighting and devouring each other till they are all entirely deſtroyed. Thouſands of them have been found dead; and the air infected by their putrid carcaſes, ſo as to occaſion malignant diſtempers.</p>
               <p>The Leming runs very ſwiftly, although its legs are ſhort and ſlender. It is ſomewhat leſs than the Rat: Its head is pointed; and in each jaw are two very long cutting teeth, with which it bites keenly; its ears are ſhort, eyes ſmall, fore legs ſhorter than the hind; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the head and body black and tawny, diſpoſed in irregular patches; the belly white, tinged with yellow.— Though perfectly diſguſting to every other people, its fleſh is ſaid to be eaten by the Laplanders.</p>
               <p>Where theſe emigrants are collected, as was before obſerved, is not certainly known. Linnaeus ſays, they are produced among the Norwegian and Lapland Alps; and Pontoppidan ſuppoſes, that Kolen's Rock, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides Nordland from Sweden, is their native place. But wherever they come from, none return: Their courſe is predeſtined, and they purſue their fate.</p>

                  <figure/> THE RAT,</head>
               <p>THOUGH ſmall, weak, and contemptible in its appearance, poſſeſſes properties that render it a more formidable enemy to mankind, and more injurious to the intereſts of ſociety, than even thoſe animals that are endued with the greateſt ſtrength and moſt rapacious diſpoſitions. To the one we can oppoſe united powers and ſuperior arts; with regard to the other, experience has convinced us, that no art can counteract the effects of its amazing fecundity, and that force is ineffectually oppoſed to an enemy poſſeſſed of ſuch variety of means to elude it.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds known in this country,—the Black Rat, which was formerly univerſal here, but is now very rarely ſeen, having been almoſt extirpated by the large brown kind, generally diſtinguiſhed by the name of the NORWAY RAT. This formidable invader is now univerſally diffuſed through the whole country; from whence every method has been tried in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate it.—This ſpecies is about nine inches long; of a light-brown colour, mixed with tawny and aſh; the throat and belly are of a dirty-white, inclining to grey; its feet are naked, and of a pale-fleſh colour; the tail is
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0209200900:362"/>
as long as the body, covered with minute duſky ſcales, thinly interſperſed with ſhort hairs.—In ſummer, it frequents the banks of rivers, ponds, and ditches; where it lives on frogs, fiſhes, and ſmall animals. But its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity is not confined entirely to theſe: It deſtroys rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, poultry, young pigeons, &amp;c.: It infeſts the grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the barn, and the ſtorehouſe; does infinite miſchief among corn and fruit of all kinds; and, not content with ſatisfying its hunger, frequently carries off large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to its hiding place.—It is a bold and fierce little animal; and, when cloſely purſued, will turn and faſten on its aſſailant. Its bite is keen; and the wound it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts is painful and difficult to heal, owing to the form of its teeth, which are long, ſharp, and of an irregular form.</p>
               <p>The Rat is amazingly prolific, uſually producing from twelve to eighteen at one time. Their numbers would ſoon increaſe beyond all power of reſtraint, were it not for an inſatiable appetite, that imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls them to deſtroy and devour each other. The weaker always fall a prey to the ſtronger; and the large male Rat, which uſually lives by itſelf, is dreaded by thoſe of its own ſpecies as their moſt formidable enemy.</p>
               <p>It is a ſingular fact, in the hiſtory of theſe animals, that the ſkins of ſuch of them as have been devoured in their holes have frequently been found, curiouſly turned inſide out; every part being completely inverted, even to the ends of the toes. How the operation is performed, it would be difficult to aſcertain; but it appears to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in ſome peculiar mode of eating out the contents.</p>
               <p>Beſides the numbers that periſh in theſe unnatural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, they have many fierce and inveterate enemies, that
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0209200900:363"/>
take every occaſion to deſtroy them. Several kinds of Dogs purſue them with great alacrity, and eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, though they invariably refuſe to eat their fleſh: The Cat is alſo a very formidable enemy, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally finds greater difficulty in the conteſt: The Rat makes a vigorous reſiſtance, and ſometimes effects its eſcape. The Weaſel is the moſt dangerous enemy of the Rat kind: It hunts them with unceaſing avidity; purſues them into their holes, where it ſoon kills them, and ſucks their blood. Mankind have likewiſe contrived various methods of deſtroying theſe bold intruders: For that purpoſe traps are often found ineffectual; ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their extreme ſagacity, that when any are drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſnare, the others by that means learn to avoid the dangerous allurement, notwithſtanding the utmoſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may have been uſed to conceal the deſign. The ſureſt method of killing them is by poiſon: Nux vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ground, and mixed with oatmeal, with a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of oil of rhodium and muſk, have been found from experience to be very effectual.</p>

We are told by anatomiſts, that, for their better ſecurity, the eyes of the Mole are furniſhed with muſcles, by which it has the power of withdrawing or exerting them at pleaſure. Its eyes are extremely ſmall, and perfectly hid in the fur; but it is probable, they are ſo formed, as to admit diſtinct images of the diminutive objects of its purſuit.

the conſtruction of its fore feet, are admirably adapted to the purpoſe of making its way in the earth, which it does with wonderful facility: They are quite naked, very broad, with large palms, almoſt like a hand; five toes on each, terminated with ſtrong nails, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave on the under ſide; and in place of a thumb, a ſtrong bone under the ſkin; the hind feet very ſmall, with five ſlender toes, and a ſmall thumb on the inſide. Whenever it happens to be ſurpriſed on the ſurface of the ground, it diſappears in an inſtant, and every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prevent its ſubterraneous retreat would be vain.</p>
               <p>The Mole is moſtly found in grounds where the ſoil is looſe and ſoft, and affords the greateſt quantity of worms and inſects, on which it feeds. The female brings forth in the ſpring, and generally produces four or five at a time: It makes its neſt a little below the ſurface of the ground, forming a commodious apartment, where it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a warm bed of moſs and herbage; from this there are ſeveral paſſages in different directions, to which it can retreat with its young ones in caſe of danger; into theſe likewiſe the animal makes excurſions in queſt of food.—In the act of forming its tracks or runs, it throws up large heaps of mould, which are extremely troubleſome and injurious in meadows, graſs-lands, and cultivated grounds; its deſtruction is conſequently an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of importance to farmers, gardeners, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſkin of the Mole is extremely tough; its fur ſhort, cloſe-ſet, and ſofter than the fineſt velvet, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the fur of any other animal; it is uſually black, ſometimes ſpotted with white, and ſometimes (though rarely) white. It is about ſix inches in length, and its tail one inch.</p>

with hair; its legs are ſhort; and its feet or hands not unlike thoſe of a Monkey, having five toes or fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on each, the thumbs on the hind feet deſtitute of nails. But the peculiar and diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of the Opoſſum is a pouch or falſe belly, in which the female depoſits her young immediately after they are brought forth, and nouriſhes them in it till they are able to provide for themſelves.—The Chevalier d'Aboville, whilſt in America during the late war, in order to be ſatisfied reſpecting the time of its geſtation, manner of bringing forth, and ſuckling its young, procured a male and female Opoſſum, which he tamed, and kept in his chamber till they copulated: Ten days after, he obſerved a conſiderable alteration in the ſize and form of the pouch; its aperture being wider than it was before, and its orifice thicker: From that time it gradually grew cloſer, leaving only a ſmall opening in the middle, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to a navel: On the fifteenth day he introduced his finger, and found at the bottom of the bag a ſmall round body, about the ſize of a pea: The twenty-fifth day he could feel a motion under his finger: After the young had been a month in the pouch, they were plainly to be ſeen on opening it a little: At the end of two months, on examining the pouch, there appeared to be ſix young ones, all of them attached to the mother by a canal that entered the mouth, which, if withdrawn, could not be replaced; but when ſix weeks old, the young Opoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum could reſume it by ſtrong ſuction, the mouth being then large enough to receive the pap, which is about two lines in length, and the ſize of the ſecond or third ſtring of a violin. The number of the young varies from five to ten or eleven. The paps are not diſpoſed in regular

               <p>The Opoſſum is a ſlow, helpleſs animal, when on the ground; but climbs trees with great eaſe and quickneſs; ſometimes conceals itſelf among the branches, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes the birds that come within its reach: It frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hangs, ſuſpended by its tail; and, in that ſituation, watches for its prey, which it darts upon with great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.—By means of its tail, the Opoſſum flings itſelf from one tree to another. It feeds on birds, reptiles, inſects, roots, leaves, and the bark of trees.

               <p>One of this ſpecies was ſhewn in London ſome years ago, and was ſaid to have been brought from Jamaica, where it is called a <hi>Potto.</hi> It was a very good-natured and ſportive animal, would catch hold of any thing with its tail, and ſuſpend itſelf by it.</p>
               <p>The RING-TAILED MACAUCO is a very beautiful animal, about the ſize of a Cat: Its body and limbs are long and ſlender; its tail very long, and marked with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate bars of black and white: In the conformation of its paws, it ſeems to approach the Monkey kind; but its noſe is long and ſharp, like that of a Fox; and its ears are alſo large and pointed: Its head and throat are white; eyes large, and ſurrounded with black: Its fur is gloſſy, ſoft, and delicate,—of a reddiſh-aſh colour on the back; belly white.</p>
               <p>This creature is found in Madagaſcar and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſles, is very playful, but not miſchievous. When in motion, it makes a ſort of galloping progreſs in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique direction, and carries its tail almoſt crect; but when ſitting, it is twiſted round the body, and brought over its head.—Troops of thirty or forty are ſometimes ſeen together.—It is a cleanly animal; and, when taken young, may be eaſily tamed.</p>

               <p>The TAIL-LESS MACAUCO is found in Ceylon and Bengal, lives in woods, and feeds on fruits; is fond of eggs and ſmall birds, which it devours greedily.

               <head>ANIMALS OF THE MONKEY KIND.</head>
               <p>WE come now to the deſcription of a numerous race of animals; conſiſting of a greater variety of kinds, and making nearer approaches to the human ſpecies, both in form and action, than any other claſs of quadrupeds.</p>
               <p>Monkies are found only in the warmeſt parts of the world, and chiefly in the torrid zone: They abound in the woods of Africa, from Senegal to the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence to Ethiopia; in all parts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia and its iſles; in the South of China; in Japan; and in South-America, from the Iſthmus of Darien as far as Paraguay: A ſpecies or two are alſo met with in Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia and the province of Barbary.</p>
               <p>On account of the numbers and different appearances of theſe animals, they have been divided into three claſſes, and deſcribed under the following denominations, viz.—APES, or ſuch as have no tails; BABOONS, or ſuch as have ſhort tails; MONKIES, or ſuch as have long tails.</p>
               <p>In the APE kind, we ſee the whole external machine ſtrongly impreſſed with the human likeneſs, and capable of ſimilar exertions: They walk upright, their poſteriors are fleſhy, their legs are furniſhed with calves, and their hands and feet are nearly like ours.</p>
               <p>In the BABOON, we perceive a more diſtant reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the human form: He generally goes upon all four, ſeldom upright, but when conſtrained to it in a ſtate of ſervitude. Some of them are as tall as a man. They have ſhort tails, long faces, ſunk eyes, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely

               <p>The MONKEY kind are removed ſtill farther, and are much leſs than the former. Their tails are generally longer than their bodies; and, although they ſit upon their poſteriors, they always move upon all four.—They are a lively, active race of animals, full of frolic and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace, greatly addicted to thieving, and extremely fond of imitating human actions, but always with a miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intention.</p>

                  <figure/> THE ORAN-OUTANG, OR WILD MAN OF THE WOODS,</head>
               <p>is the largeſt of all the Ape kind, and makes the neareſt approach to the human figure. One of this kind, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected by Dr Tyſon, has been very accurately deſcribed by him. The principal external differences pointed out by that learned phyſician, conſiſted in the great length of the arms, and ſhortneſs of the thighs; the thumb is alſo much ſmaller, and the palm of the hand longer and narrower, than in man; the form of the feet is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar, the toes being much longer, and the large toe placed at a greater diſtance from the others; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is too high, the noſe flat, and the eyes much ſunk: Beſide theſe, the anatomiſt has enumerated a variety of eſſential differences in the internal conformation of the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0209200900:397"/>
Oran-Outang, all of which ſufficiently evince, that, though he has the ſtrongeſt affinity to the human form of any other quadruped; yet, as Buffon elegantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, "the interval which ſeparates the two ſpecies is immenſe; the reſemblance in figure and organization, and the movements of imitation which ſeem to reſult from theſe ſimilarities, neither make him approach the nature of man, nor elevate him above that of the brute."</p>
               <p>The Oran-Outang is found in the interior parts of Africa, in Madagaſcar, Borneo, and ſome parts of the Eaſt-Indies. It is a ſolitary animal, avoids mankind, and lives only in the moſt deſert places. The largeſt of the kind are ſaid to be about ſix feet high, very active, ſtrong, and intrepid, capable of overcoming the ſtrongeſt man: They are likewiſe exceedingly ſwift, and cannot eaſily be taken alive. They live entirely on fruits and nuts, will ſometimes attack and kill the negroes who wander in the woods, and drive away the elephants that happen to approach too near the place of their reſidence: They ſometimes ſurprize the female negroes, and carry them off into the woods, where they compel them to ſtay with them.—When taken young, however, the Oran-Outang is capable of being tamed, and rendered extremely docile. One of them, ſhewn in London ſome years ago, was taught to ſit at table, make uſe of a ſpoon or fork in eating its victuals, and drink wine or other liquors out of a glaſs. It was extremely mild, affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and good-natured; much attached to its keeper, and obedient to his commands. Its aſpect was grave, and its diſpoſition melancholy. It was young, and only two feet four inches high. Its body was covered with hair of a black colour, which was much thicker and cloſer on
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0209200900:398"/>
the back than on the fore part of the body; the hands and ſoles of the feet were naked, and of a duſky colour.</p>
               <p>A variety, called the PIGMY, is found in Guinea, Ethiopia, and other parts of Africa, much ſmaller than the laſt, being not more than a foot and a half in length. It is very tractable, good-natured, and eaſily tamed; is ſuppoſed to have been the <hi>Pithecos</hi> of the ancients. It lives in woods, and feeds on fruits and inſects.—Troops of them aſſemble together, and defend themſelves from the attacks of wild beaſts in the deſert by throwing a cloud of ſand behind them, which blinds their purſuers, and facilitates their eſcape.</p>

               <p>differs from animals of the Ape kind, not only in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearance, but alſo in temper and diſpoſition. Fierce, untractable, and libidinous, its diſpoſition ſeems to partake of the hideous and diſguſting deformities of its outward figure. Its body is thick, compact, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; and its ſtrength prodigious. Neither art nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes can render it in any degree docile or obedient: It ſeems to be continually fretting with rage, and ſeeking every opportunity of ſhewing its ſavage and vicious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities. In a ſtate of captivity, it muſt be kept cloſely confined; and, even in that ſtate, we have ſeen one ſhake the bars of its cage ſo powerfully with its hands, as to excite the utmoſt terror in the ſpectators.</p>

long and thick, eyes ſmall and deep ſunk, its canine teeth very large and formidable, and it had pouches in its cheeks; the hair on its head was long, and formed a very elegant toupee from its forehead and each ſide of its face, which, when angry, it erected; the hair on the body was uniformly of a light reddiſh-brown; the tail ſhort, and darker at the end; buttocks red and naked.</p>
               <p>The Baboon inhabits the hotteſt parts of Africa; feeds on fruits, roots, and other vegetables.—Numerous troops ſometimes make their appearance, plundering gardens and cultivated grounds. They are extremely dexterous in throwing the fruit from one to another, and by this means will do incredible damage in a very ſhort time.</p>
               <p>The female brings forth only one young at a time, which ſhe carries in her arms, and ſuckles at her breaſt. Notwithſtanding its libidinous diſpoſition, it will not breed in temperate climates.</p>

               <p>One of this kind was exhibited about twelve years ago in the North of England. It was five feet high, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fierce, libidinous, and ſtrong. At the ſight of women, it diſcovered marks of the moſt violent paſſion; and at one time caught hold of a lady, who was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautious as to approach too near it; and ſhe was with ſome difficulty reſcued by the interference of the keeper. Its voice was ſtrong and harſh, not unlike the ordinary growl of the Lion. It generally went upon its four feet, unleſs obliged by its keeper to ſtand erect. Its moſt uſual attitude was ſitting on its rump, with its arms placed before it.</p>
               <p>This creature inhabits the hotter parts of Africa.— Schreber ſays, it lives on ſucculent fruits and nuts, is fond of eggs, will put eight at once into its pouches, then take them out one by one, break them at the end, and ſwallow the contents.</p>

               <head>THE URSINE BABOON</head>
               <p>is not unlike the laſt, but rather leſs. Its noſe is long; head large; ears ſhort; forehead high and prominent, terminating in a ridge; the body thick and ſtrong, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with long duſky hair, which gives it the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a young Bear; its tail half the length of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; buttocks red.</p>
               <p>This animal is very numerous about the Cape of Good Hope.—Troops of them aſſemble together, and make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions for the ſake of plunder, in which they obſerve the utmoſt precaution: To prevent ſurprize, they place a centinel, which, upon fight of a man, gives a loud yell; when the whole troop retreats with the greateſt precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It is highly entertaining to ſee the females carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off their young ones clinging to their backs; whilſt their pouches are crammed ſo full of fruit, that they ſeem ready to burſt. They ſometimes form a line, and throw the fruit from one to another, in order to carry it off the more expeditiouſly.</p>

               <p>There are ſeveral varieties of this ſpecies. The bodies

               <p>or HARE-LIPPED MONKEY of Mr Pennant, is placed next to the Baboons, and makes the neareſt approach to them in the form of its body, which is ſhort and thick: Its head and muzzle are large; its viſage ugly, naked, and wrinkled; and its noſtrils divided, like thoſe of a Hare: Its tail, however, is long, like that of a Monkey: The colour of the hair on the upper part of the body is a greeniſh-aſh,—lighter on the breaſt and belly.—There are ſeveral varieties, which differ both in ſize and colour.</p>

It is remarkable for the brilliancy of its coat, which is of ſo bright a red, as to have the appearance of being painted.</p>

               <p>Travellers relate, that in Guinea Monkies are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen together in troops of forty or fifty, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering gardens and fields of corn with great boldneſs.

The tails of all the Sagoins, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are longer than thoſe of the Sapajous, ſtraight, flaccid, and entirely covered with hair.—This difference alone is ſufficient to diſtinguiſh a Sapajou from a Sagoin.</p>

               <p>The Coaitas are very lively and active.—In paſſing from one tree to another, they ſometimes form a chain, linked to each other by their tails; and ſwing in that manner till the loweſt catches hold of a branch, and draws up the reſt.—When fruits are ripe, they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fat; and their fleſh is then ſaid to be excellent.</p>
               <p>There are many varieties of the Coaita, which differ chiefly in colour.

They adhered cloſely to the teats of the mother; and, when grown a little larger, fixed themſelves upon her back, from whence ſhe could not eaſily diſengage them, without rubbing them off againſt a wall: Upon theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the male always allowed them to mount upon his back to relieve the female.</p>

There are, probably, ſtill more, which neither the aſſiduity of the naturaliſt, nor the curioſity of the traveller, has been able to draw from their native woods. Indeed, there is great room to conjecture, that
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0209200900:426"/>
the variations of the Monkey kind are ſomewhat like thoſe of the Dog, continually encreaſing; for it is very obvious, that, among the ſmaller kinds of Monkies, the characteriſtic differences do not appear to be great, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may vary in ſize or in colour; and it is certain, that the modes of living, faculties, and propenſities of theſe animals, are ſtrikingly ſimilar: So that, if we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from analogy on this ſubject, we may fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that different kinds of Monkies may unite and propagate with the ſame facility as the Goat and the Sheep, or the almoſt innumerable kinds of Dogs.</p>

               <p>The Porcupine is found in India, Perſia, and Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: It is likewiſe common in all parts of Africa.—The Indians hunt it for its quills, of which they make a kind of embroidery: They alſo eat its fleſh.</p>

               <p>There are few Dogs that will venture to attack the Hedge-hog, except ſuch as are trained to the ſport, merely to gratify the cruel pleaſure of ſeeing a harmleſs animal endure, with aſtoniſhing patience, the moſt wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton outrages; whilſt the Dogs, becoming more enraged at the wounds they receive from its prickles, at laſt oblige it to unfold itſelf; and it then ſoon falls a victim to their fury.</p>

               <p>IS the moſt induſtrious of all animals. Its labours ſeem the reſult of a ſocial compact, formed for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual convenience, preſervation, and ſupport; and as, in all well-regulated ſocieties, a due ſubordination is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the well ordering and conducting each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual effort to the advantage of the whole; ſo, amongſt theſe curious animals, we find, that, in forming their habitations, all have their proper part of the work aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to them, that, by dividing their labours, ſafety, ſtability, and expedition, may be the general effect. To this purpoſe, a community of two or three hundred aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together: An overſeer is appointed, whoſe orders are punctually obeyed; and, by ſtriking the water ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his tail, gives the ſignal where the united force of numbers is neceſſary to be applied, in order to ſtrengthen or ſupport the fabric; or, at the approach of an enemy, to apprize the ſociety of their danger.—As ſoon as a convenient place is choſen for the erection of their building, which is generally a level piece of ground, with a ſmall rivulet running through it, they divide into
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0209200900:435"/>
companies: Some are employed in cutting down trees of great ſize, which is done by gnawing them with their teeth: Theſe they lay acroſs the dam with ſurprizing la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and perſeverance, or form them into piles, which others roll down to the water, make holes at the bottom for receiving the ends, and placing them upright, ſecure them in that poſition; whilſt another party is engaged in collecting twigs, interweaving and twiſting them with the piles, and thereby ſtrengthening the work: Some collect large quantities of earth, ſtones, clay, and other ſolid materials, which they diſpoſe of on the upper ſide of the piles next the ſtream, forming a mound ten or twelve feet thick at the bottom, tapering gradually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and capable of ſuſtaining a conſiderable weight of water: The length of the dam, occaſioned by this means, is ſometimes not leſs than one hundred feet.—Having compleated the mole, their next care is to erect their apartments, which are built on piles: They are of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form, and generally conſiſt of three ſtories, about eight feet high above the water: The firſt lies below the level of the dam, and is generally full of water; the other two are above it. The walls are two feet in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neatly plaiſtered with clay on the inſide, which is arched like an oven, and at the top reſembles a dome. In each houſe there are two openings,—one toward the water, to which the animal has always acceſs in caſe of ſurprize; the other toward the land, by which it goes out in queſt of food.—The number of houſes in one of theſe dams is from ten to twenty-five, ſome of them large enough to contain a family of twenty or thirty Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Each Beaver forms its bed of moſs; and each fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily lays in its magazine of winter proviſion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0209200900:436"/>
of bark and boughs of trees: They pile up the latter with great ingenuity and regularity, and draw it out to their apartments as their wants require.—They are ſaid to be fondeſt of the ſaſſafras, aſh, and ſweet gum.—Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſummer, they feed on leaves, fruits, and ſometimes crabs or cray-fiſh; but fiſh is not their favourite food. —Their time of building is early in the ſummer: In winter, they never go farther than to their proviſion ſtores; and, during that ſeaſon, are very fat.—They breed once a year, and bring forth two or three at a birth.</p>
               <p>Beavers are found chiefly in the northern parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Aſia, and America; particularly the latter, from whence many thouſands of their ſkins are annually brought into Europe. In 1763, the Hudſon's Bay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſold 54,670 Beaver ſkins at one ſale.—They vary in colour: The moſt valuable are black; but the general colour is a cheſnut-brown, more or leſs dark. Some have been found entirely white, others ſpotted; but both theſe kinds are very rare.</p>
               <p>The Beaver is remarkable for the ſize and ſtrength of its cutting teeth, which enable it to gnaw down trees of great magnitude with eaſe. Its ears are ſhort, and almoſt hid in the fur; its noſe blunt; tail broad and flat, nearly of an oval form, and covered with ſcales—it ſerves not only as a rudder to direct its motions in the water, but as a moſt uſeful inſtrument for laying on the clay, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it into the crevices, and ſmoothing the outward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering; its fore feet are ſmall, and not unlike thoſe of a Rat; the hind feet are large and ſtrong, with membranes between each toe; its length, from noſe to tail, is about three feet; the tail is eleven inches long, and three broad.</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH the Otter is not conſidered by naturaliſts as wholly amphibious, it is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enabled to remain a conſiderable time under water, and can purſue and take its prey in that element with great facility.—The legs are very ſhort, but remarkably ſtrong, broad, and muſcular; on each foot are five toes, connected by ſtrong membranes, like thoſe of water fowl; the head is broad, of an oval form, and flat on the upper part; the body is long and round, and the tail ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to a point; the eyes are brilliant, and placed in ſuch a manner, that the animal can ſee every object that is above it, which gives it a ſingular aſpect, very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling an eel or an aſp; the ears are ſhort, and their orifice narrow. The fur of the Otter is of a deep-brown colour, with two ſmall light ſpots on each ſide of the noſe, and another under the chin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:0209200900:439"/>This animal makes its neſt in ſome retired ſpot by the ſide of a lake or river, under a bank, where it has an eaſy and ſecure acceſs to the water, to which it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately flies upon the leaſt alarm; and, as it ſwims with great rapidity, generally eſcapes from its purſuers.—It deſtroys great quantities of fiſh; and, in purſuit of its prey, has been obſerved commonly to ſwim againſt the ſtream.—As ſoon as the Otter has caught a fiſh, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drags it to the ſhore; devours a part, as far as the vent; and, unleſs preſſed by extreme hunger, always leaves the remainder, and takes to the water in queſt of more.</p>
               <p>Otters are generally taken in traps placed near their landing places, where they are carefully concealed in the ſand.—When hunted with Dogs, the old ones defend themſelves with great obſtinacy: They bite ſeverely, and do not readily quit their hold where they have once faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened. An old Otter will never give up while it has life; nor make the leaſt complaint, though wounded ever ſo much by the Dogs, or even when transfixed with a ſpear.</p>
               <p>There are many inſtances of Otters being tamed; but in thoſe which have come to our knowledge, they were taken when young, and accuſtomed by degrees to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reſtraint. They became ſo far domeſticated, as to follow their maſters, anſwer to a name, and employ their excellent talents at fiſhing in their ſervice.</p>
               <p>Some years ago, James Campbell, near Inverneſs, had a young Otter, which he brought up and tamed. It would follow him wherever he choſe; and, if called on by its name, would immediately obey. When apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of danger from Dogs, it ſought the protection of its
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0209200900:440"/>
maſter, and would endeavour to fly into his arms for greater ſecurity.—It was frequently employed in catching fiſh, and would ſometimes take eight or ten ſalmon in a day. If not prevented, it always made an attempt to break the fiſh behind the fin next the tail; and as ſoon as one was taken away, it immediately dived in purſuit of more. When tired, it would refuſe to fiſh any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and was then rewarded with as much fiſh as it could devour: Being ſatisfied with eating, it always curled itſelf round, and fell aſleep; in which ſtate it was generally carried home.—The ſame Otter fiſhed as well in the ſea as in a river, and took great numbers of codlings and other fiſh.—Its food was generally freſh fiſh, and ſometimes milk.</p>
               <p>Another perſon, who kept a tame Otter, ſuffered it to follow him with his Dogs. It was very uſeful to him in fiſhing, by going into the water, and driving trouts and other fiſh towards the net.—It was remarkable, that the Dogs, though accuſtomed to the ſport, were ſo far from giving it the ſmalleſt moleſtation, that they would not even hunt an Otter whilſt it remained with them; on which account the owner was under the neceſſity of diſpoſing of it.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Otter's avidity for fiſh, it will not eat it unleſs it be perfectly freſh: When that cannot be procured, it is fed with milk, or pudding made of oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Otters are found in moſt parts of the world, with no great variation.—They are common in Guiana, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the rivers and marſhes of that country. They are ſometimes ſeen in great numbers together; and are ſo
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0209200900:441"/>
fierce, that it is dangerous to come near them. They live in holes, which they make in the banks of the rivers.</p>
               <p>The Otters of Cayenne are very large, weighing from ninety to one hundred pounds. They frequent the large rivers of that country. Their cry is loud, and may be heard to a great diſtance. They are of a dark-brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Their fur is ſhorter than that of the Beaver, and very ſoft.</p>
               <p>The SMALL OTTER, found in Poland and the North of Europe, is much leſs than the common Otter, and of a duſky-brown colour: Its feet are broad, webbed, and covered with hair; its fur is very valuable, being next in beauty to that of the Sable.</p>
               <p>This Otter is found alſo in North-America, where it is called the MINX; frequents the water, and lives on fiſh; is fond of poultry; frequently ſteals into the hen rooſts, bites off the heads of the fowls, and ſucks their blood; is very fetid; and, when irritated, has a moſt loathſome ſmell.—Its length, from noſe to tail, is twenty inches; tail four. Its fur is of a dark-brown colour, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gloſſy and beautiful.</p>

               <p>Vaſt numbers of theſe animals inhabit the coaſt of Kamtſchatka, and the numerous iſlands contiguous to it; as well as the oppoſite coaſts of America, diſcovered by the Ruſſians: They are alſo found in ſome of the larger rivers of South-America.—Their ſkins are of great value, and have long been conſidered by the Ruſſians as form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſiderable article of their commerce. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them to the Chineſe at the rate of ſeventy or a hundred rubles each, and receive in return ſome of their moſt valuable commodities.</p>
               <p>The fur of the Sea-Otter is thick and long, of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſhining black colour, but ſometimes of a ſilvery hue; the legs are thick and ſhort; toes joined by a web; the hind feet like thoſe of a Seal; length, from noſe to tail, four feet two inches; tail thirteen, flat, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the end.—The largeſt of them weigh from ſeventy to eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>The Sea-Otter is remarkably harmleſs, and moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately fond of its young: It will pine to death for its loſs, and die on the very ſpot where it has been taken
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0209200900:443"/>
away. Before its young can ſwim, it will carry it in its paws, and ſupport it in the water, laying upon its back. —It ſwims in various poſitions,—on its back, ſides, and even in a perpendicular poſture; and in the water is very ſportive. Two of them are ſometimes ſeen embracing each other. It frequents ſhallow places, abounding with ſea weed; and feeds on lobſters, crabs, and other ſhell fiſh.—It breeds but once a year, and produces one young at a time, which it ſuckles and carefully attends almoſt a year.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a young Otter is reckoned delicate eating, and not eaſily diſtinguiſhed from that of lamb.</p>

Its motions are accompanied with a moſt piteous and lamentable cry, which is its only defence, and ſecures it from the attacks of beaſts of prey, which are ſaid to quit it with horror upon hearing its cry.</p>
               <p>Though ſlow, aukward, and almoſt incapable of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Sloth is ſtrong, remarkably tenacious of life, and capable of enduring a long abſtinence from food.

               <p>THERE are ſeveral animals diſtinguiſhed by the common name of Ant-eaters, which differ great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in form.—They are divided into three claſſes, viz. the Great, the Middle, and the Leſſer Ant-eater.</p>
               <p>The GREAT ANT-EATER is nearly four feet in length, excluſive of its tail, which is two and a half. It is remarkable for the great length of its ſnout, which is of a cylindrical form, and ſerves as a ſheath to its long and ſlender tongue, which always lies folded double in its mouth, and is the chief inſtrument by which it finds ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>This creature is a native of Brazil and Guiana, runs ſlowly, frequently ſwims over rivers, lives wholly on ants, which it collects by thruſting its tongue into their holes; and, having penetrated every part of the neſt, withdraws it into its mouth loaded with prey.—Its legs are ſo ſtrong, that few animals can extricate themſelves
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:0209200900:447"/>
from its gripe. It is ſaid to be formidable even to the Panthers of America; and ſometimes fixes itſelf upon them in ſuch a manner, that both of them fall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together; for its obſtinacy is ſo great, that it will not extricate itſelf from its adverſary even after he is dead.—The fleſh has a ſtrong diſagreeable taſte, but is eaten by the Indians.</p>
               <p>The MIDDLE ANT-EATER is one foot ſeven inches from noſe to tail. It inhabits the ſame countries, and procures its food in the ſame manner, as the laſt. Its tail is ten inches long, with which it ſecures its hold in climbing trees by twiſting it round the branches.—Both theſe animals have four ſtrong claws on the fore feet, and five on the hind.</p>
               <p>The LESSER ANT-EATER has a ſharp-pointed noſe, inclining a little downward: Its ears are ſmall, and hid in the fur: It has two ſtrong hooked claws on the fore feet, the outward one being much the largeſt; and four on the hind feet: Its fur is long, ſoft, and ſilky,—of a yellowiſh-brown colour: Its length, from noſe to tail, is ſeven inches and a half; tail above eight, thick at the baſe, and taper to the end.—It inhabits Guiana, climbs trees in queſt of a ſpecies of ants which build their neſts among the branches.</p>
               <p>Animals of this kind are found in Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope.—Kolben deſcribes the latter as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long heads and tongues; that they feed on ants; and are ſo ſtrong, that, if they faſten their claws in the ground, they cannot eaſily be pulled away.—It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Ceylon the <hi>Talg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the upper parts of its body are cloſely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſcales of different ſizes, which it can erect at pleaſure, oppoſing to its adverſary a formidable row of offenſive weapons, which wound while they reſiſt, and thus repel the moſt rapacious invader. The Tiger, the Panther, or the Leopard, in vain attempt to force it. The moment it perceives the approach of an enemy, it rolls itſelf up like a Hedge-hog, and by that means ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures all the weaker parts of its body.</p>
               <p>This creature is a native of Formoſa and the Indian iſles; is likewiſe found in Guinea, where it feeds on ants, which it takes by laying out its long red tongue, covered with an unctuous ſlime, acroſs the paths of thoſe inſects.—It is ſlow in its motions; grows to the length of eight feet, including its tail, which is four.—Its fleſh is much eſteemed for its delicacy; but it is difficult to

They are all covered with a ſtrong cruſt or ſhell, and are diſtinguiſhed from each other by the number of the flexible bands of which it is compoſed.—It is a harmleſs, inoffenſive animal; feeds on roots, fruits, and other vegetables; grows very fat; and is greatly eſteemed for the delicacy of its fleſh.— The Indians hunt it with ſmall Dogs, trained for that purpoſe.—When ſurprized, it runs to its hole, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to make a new one, which it does with great expedition, having ſtrong claws on its fore feet, with which it adheres ſo firmly to the ground, that, if it ſhould be caught by the tail whilſt making its way into

the earth, its reſiſtance is ſo great, that it will ſometimes leave it in the hands of its purſuers: To avoid this, the hunter has recourſe to artifice; and, by tickling it with a ſtick, it gives up its hold, and ſuffers itſelf to be taken alive. If no other means of eſcape be left, it rolls itſelf up within its covering by drawing in its head and legs, and bringing its tail round them, as a band to connect them more forcibly together: In this ſituation it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eſcapes by rolling itſelf over the edge of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, and generally falls to the bottom unhurt.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſucceſsful method of catching Armadillos is by ſnares laid for them by the ſides of rivers and places where they frequent. They all burrow very deep in the ground, and ſeldom ſtir out, except during the night, whilſt they are in ſearch of food.</p>
               <p>To give a minute deſcription of the ſhells or coverings of the Armadillos would be extremely difficult, as they are all compoſed of a number of parts, differing greatly from each other in the order and diſpoſition of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures with which they are diſtinguiſhed: But it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that in general there are two large pieces that cover the ſhoulders and the rump, between which lie the bands, which are more or leſs in number in different kinds.

               <p>THERE are ſeveral animals whoſe reſidence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtantly in the water, and which ſeem to partake greatly of the nature of fiſhes, that are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs claſſed by naturaliſts under the denomination of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds; and being perfectly amphibious, living with equal eaſe in the water as on land, may be conſidered as the laſt ſtep in the ſcale of Nature, by which we are conducted from one great diviſion of the animal world to the other. Of theſe the Walrus is the moſt conſiderable for its ſize, being ſometimes found eighteen feet in length, and twelve in circumference at the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part: It is likewiſe remarkable for two large tuſks in the upper jaw, which ſometimes exceed two feet in length, and weigh from three to twenty pounds each.</p>
               <p>The head of the Walrus is round; its lips very broad, and covered over with thick pellucid briſtles; its eyes ſmall and red; inſtead of ears, it has two ſmall orifices; and above the whiſkers, ſemicircular noſtrils, through
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:0209200900:455"/>
which it throws out water like the whale, but with much leſs noiſe: Its ſkin is thick and wrinkled, and has a thin covering of ſhort browniſh hair; its legs are ſhort; it has five toes on each foot, connected by membranes, and on each toe a ſmall nail; the hind feet are very broad, and extended nearly on a line with the body.</p>
               <p>The Walrus is chiefly found in the northern ſeas. Great herds of them are ſometimes ſeen together on the ſea ſhore, or ſleeping on an iſland of ice. When alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they inſtantly throw themſelves into the water with great precipitation: If wounded, they become bold and furious, and unite in the defence of each other; will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack a boat, and endeavour to ſink it by ſtriking their great teeth into its ſides, at the ſame time bellowing in a moſt hideous manner.—It is hunted for its teeth, which are equal to thoſe of the Elephant for durability and whiteneſs.—An ordinary Walrus is ſaid to yield half a ton of oil, equal in goodneſs to that of the whale.</p>
               <p>The female produces one or two young at a time, which ſhe ſuckles upon land.</p>
               <p>In climbing upon the ice, the Walrus makes uſe of its teeth as hooks to ſecure its hold, and draw its great unwieldy body after it.—It feeds on ſea-weeds and ſhell-fiſh, which it is ſaid to diſengage from the rocks to which they adhere with its tuſks.—The White Bear is its greateſt enemy. In the combats between theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the Walrus, is ſaid to be generally victorious, on account of the deſperate wounds it inflicts with its teeth.</p>

               <p>is found, with ſome variety, in almoſt every quarter of the globe: In the northern ſeas of Aſia, Europe, and America; as well as the leſs frequented regions towards the ſouth pole.—Its uſual length is from five to ſix feet: The body is cloſely covered with ſhort hair of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours, ſmooth and ſhining; its tongue is forked at the end; it has two canine teeth in each jaw, ſix cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teeth in the upper, and four in the lower; it has five toes on each foot, furniſhed with ſtrong ſharp claws, which enable it to climb the rocks, on which it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baſks.—It ſwims with great ſtrength and ſwiftneſs, is very playful, and ſports without fear about ſhips and boats. It feeds on various kinds of fiſh, and is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen near the ſhore in purſuit of its prey.</p>
               <p>Seals are found in great abundance on the coaſts of Great-Britain; particularly in the deep receſſes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns in the northern parts of the iſland, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort in the breeding time, and continue till the young ones are old enough to go to ſea.—The time for taking Seals is in the month of October, or the beginning of November. The hunters, provided with torches and bludgeons, enter the mouths of the caverns about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0209200900:457"/>
and row in as far as they can, where they land; and, being properly ſtationed, begin by making a great noiſe, which alarms the Seals, and brings them down from all parts of the cavern in a confuſed body, making frightful ſhrieks and cries. In this hazardous employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, great care is neceſſary on the part of the hunters to avoid the throng, which preſſes down with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, and bears away every thing that oppoſes its progreſs; but when the firſt crowd is paſt, they kill great numbers of young ones, which generally ſtraggle behind, by ſtriking them on the noſe.</p>
               <p>A young Seal yields above eight gallons of oil.—When full grown, their ſkins are very valuable, and make a beautiful kind of leather, much uſed in making ſhoes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Seal is ſometimes eaten; and that it was formerly admitted to the tables of the great, may be ſeen in the bill-of-fare of a ſumptuous entertainment given by Archbiſhop Nevil in the reign of Edward the Fourth.</p>
               <p>The growth of Seals is ſo amazingly rapid, that, after nine tides from their birth, they are as active as the old ones.—The female brings forth her young on the land, ſits on her hind legs while ſhe ſuckles them, and as ſoon as they are able carries them to ſea, learns them to ſwim and ſearch for food: When they become fatigued, ſhe places them on her back. The young ones know the voice of their mother, and attend to her call.—The voice of the Seal has been compared to the hoarſe barking of a Dog; when young, it is clearer, and reſembles the mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Cat.</p>
               <p>Seals are likewiſe found in the Mediterranean and Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian

ſeas, in the lake Baikal, and ſome of the larger lakes. Theſe are ſmaller than the ſalt-water Seals; but ſo fat, that they ſeem almoſt ſhapeleſs.</p>

               <p>is much larger than the common Seal, being eight feet in length, and weighing eight hundred pounds.— Theſe animals are found among the iſlands which lie between Kamtſchatka and America; alſo on the coaſts of New Zealand, Staten Iſland, New Georgia, and Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Iſlands.—They lie in thouſands on the ſhore, in ſeparate families, each conſiſting of above an hundred. One male will ſometimes have fifty females, which he guards with extreme jealouſy. They are exceſſively fat and indolent, ſometimes ſcarcely ever moving from the place where they lie, for the ſpace of three months; during which time the females breed and ſuckle their
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0209200900:459"/>
young. If another approach their ſtation, they are rouſed from their ſupineneſs: A battle enſues, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently becomes general, and ſpreads confuſion through the whole ſhore. Theſe conflicts are extremely violent, and the wounds they receive very deep, reſembling a cut with a ſabre.</p>
               <p>The attachment of the male to the young is very ſtrong: He defends them with great obſtinacy, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently revenges their loſs upon the female, whom he beats moſt cruelly; whilſt ſhe crawls to his feet, and ſeems to deprecate his wrath with the moſt obſequious g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtures.</p>
               <p>The female generally brings forth one, ſeldom two, at a time.—They ſwim with great eaſe, at the rate of about ſeven miles in an hour. When wounded, they will ſeize on a boat, carry it along with them, and ſometimes ſink it. They can continue a long time under water. In climbing rocks, they faſten their fore paws, and draw themſelves up.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and all the Seal kind, will live a long time after receiving the moſt dreadful wounds; but the moſt trifling blow on the ſnout or forehead inſtantly kills them.</p>
               <p>The general colour of theſe animals is black. They are covered with a coat of long rough hair, under which is a ſoft down of a bay colour. On the neck of the old ones, the hair is erect, and a little longer than the reſt. —The fat and fleſh of the old males are very nauſeous; but thoſe of the females and the young, when roaſted, are ſaid to be as good as the fleſh of a ſucking pig.</p>

               <p>OF which we here give a faithful portrait from a living one lately brought from the interior parts of America, ſeems to be a different animal from that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſcribed under the name of the Elk or Mooſe-Deer, to which it has very little reſemblance. It ſeems, indeed, to belong to a diſtinct ſpecies; and is probably
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0209200900:461"/>
the Elk or Orignal of Canada and the northern parts of America.—At the age of five years, its length was nine feet from the end of the muzzle to the inſertion of the tail, the head and neck being extended in a line with the body; its height at the ſhoulder four feet ſix inches, length of the head one foot ſix inches, breadth over the forehead ſeven inches, length of the fore legs two feet five inches, length of the neck two feet ſix, its ears nine inches, and tail three. Its horns, which it had juſt ſhed, are not palmated, like thoſe of the Mooſe: They are large; and, when full grown, meaſure above ſix feet from tip to tip. The antlers are round, and pointed at the ends: The lowermoſt antler forms a curve down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward over each eye, to which it appears a defence. Its hair was long, of a dark dun colour on the back and ſides, on the head and legs dark-brown. Its eyes full and lively; and below each there is a deep ſlit, about two inches in length, the uſe of which we are unable to diſcover.—It was a lively, active animal; of great ſtrength of body and limbs. Its hoofs are much ſmaller than thoſe of the Rein-Deer, the diviſion between them leſs; and, when the animal is in motion, do not make a rattling noiſe. It has no mane; but the hair under its neck is longer than that of any other part of the body.</p>
               <p>We are told by the owner of this very rare and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful animal, that it does not attain its full growth till twenty years old, and that it ſheds its horns every third year.</p>

               <head>WILD CATTLE.</head>
               <p>WE have been favoured, by Marmaduke Tunſtall, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Wycliffe, with the following particulars relative to the Wild Cattle of this iſland, which, it has been generally ſuppoſed, were only to be found at Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham, in the county of Northumberland:— They are very numerous at Wollaton, in Nottinghamſhire, the ſeat of Lord Middleton. The ears and noſes of theſe are black. When fat, they weigh from ſixty to ſeventy ſtone. As ſoon as the calves are dropped, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken away, and put to a tame Cow to be brought up.—At Giſburne in Craven, Yorkſhire, the ſeat of— Liſter, <abbr>eſq</abbr> there are ſome perfectly white, except the inſides of their ears, which are brown; without horns, very ſtrong-boned, but not high. They have little or no fat within; but it is finely interlarded with the fleſh. They are ſaid to have been brought originally from Whalley Abbey, in Lancaſhire, upon its diſſolution in the 33d of Henry VIII. Tradition ſays, they were drawn to Giſburne by the power of muſic.—Beſides theſe, there are great numbers of Wild Cattle at Lime-Hall, in Cheſhire, the ſeat of — Leigh, <abbr>eſq</abbr> They are all white, and have red ears.—There were formerly great numbers of Wild Cattle at Chartley, in Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, the ſeat of Earl Ferrers; but their numbers are now much reduced, and the breed almoſt extinct."</p>
               <p>Theſe are all the accounts we have been able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0209200900:463"/>
of this expiring breed, which formerly ranged at large in the wild and extenſive foreſts which overſpread this kingdom.</p>
