            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS Poem which was writ with a Deſign to ſhew the Prevalence and Power of Union, could to no Perſon be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Addreſt than Your Lordſhip, who have ever ſince You have appear'd in the World been ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of Union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0388000900:3"/>
In thoſe great Offices of the higheſt Truſt; in which Your Lordſhip has been employ'd at the ſame Time, both by the Prince and the People, You have always made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of thoſe Publick and Noble Principles which alone are capable of Uniting the Prince and the People.</p>
            <p>And while in the late Reign the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hearken'd to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Advice in Parliament, they were united in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and their Deſigns to the great People whom they repreſented. The Nerves of War were duely ſupply'd, and that War was carried on
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:4"/>
Vigorouſly. The Greatneſs of <hi>France</hi> was ſapp'd by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and inſenſibly Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, and prepar'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a terrible Shock from the firſt Blow it ſhould meet with. But as ſoon as Your Lordſhip's Enemies began to prevail in thoſe Illuſtrious Aſſemblies, a Spirit of Parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ill Underſtood and worſe Tim'd crept in amongſt them, and forc'd the beſt and moſt diſcerning of Kings to make a fatal Peace, which has endanger'd the Liberties of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Power and Traffick of this <hi>Kingdom</hi>; and has coſt this Nation ſo many Thouſands of Lives and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:5"/>
many Millions of Money, and which makes us ev'n at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent contented, in order to the ending this juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary War, to furniſh thoſe Supplies in the very midſt of Scarcity, which we then grumbling with-held in the Height of the greateſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
            <p>My Lord, The late King who was ſo True and ſo Juſt a Judge of Men, was ſo very well convinc'd of Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Services both to the Crown and the People, that He took care by two juſt and two grateful Acts, that is, by calling You up to the Houſe of Peers, and making You
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:6"/>
Auditor of the Exchequer, that Your Country ſhould never want Your Service in Parliament, nor the Crown Your Abilities in the great Employments of the State.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary Regard which ſo great a King always expreſs'd for Your Lordſhip's extraordinary Merit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd Your Enemies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fix on You the odious Name of Favourite, as they have ſince attempted to faſten it on ſome of Your Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Friends. But with how much Malice, or how much Ignorance have both Attempts been made! For a Favourite is the Prince's meer
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:7"/>
Creature, whoſe only Merit is His Sovereign's Favour, and ſuch an Object of the Prince's Favour is always that of the Peoples Scorn and Hatred, and often expoſes the very Sovereign to the ſame Contempt and Hatred. Sovereign Princes are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd by their Duty to God, themſelves and their People, to ſhew moſt Regard for thoſe who do moſt for the good of the People whom They govern. And when they perform that Duty, ev'n Kings are Juſtly Honour'd the more for the Merits of their Subjects. How Happy is the Nation where the Miniſters
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:8"/>
of Kings become the Darlings of the People. How Happy was <hi>England</hi> during the Time of Your Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration! When Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was united both to the King and the People; when the People declar'd aloud by their Repreſentatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that You had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Honours by which the King diſtinguiſh'd You! How Happy are we now, when the Queen Employs the moſt extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Higheſt Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whoſe Praiſes are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by the Auguſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Parliament, and ecchoed by every part of the
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:9"/>
Kingdom. Since never Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were more univerſally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd by the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> than the late King and the preſent Queen, 'tis an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſign that the ſame People approve of their cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip, who in the late Reign was conſtantly employ'd in uniting the King and the People, or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, has been juſtly thought in this to be the fitteſt Perſon to maintain Union between the two Sovereign Princes in whom <hi>England</hi> is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. With how ſenſible a pleaſure do all who have the
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:10"/>
Honour to know Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, conſider the People of <hi>Hanover</hi> ſurveying You with a venerable Awe, as a Perſon employ'd in Affairs of the Higheſt Truſt and the Higheſt Conſequence by the Two greateſt Princes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ruled the braveſt People of <hi>Europe.</hi> The late King made choice of Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to ſtand in the Breach which Faction had made in the Ramparts of Liberty. The Queen has choſen You not only to reſiſt but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack Faction, and to drive it from its laſt Retrenchment, by ſettling and ſecuring an intire Correſpondence between
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:11"/>
Her Majeſty and Her preſumptive Heir. And the Queen could not poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a greater Truſt in Your Lordſhip than by employing You in an Affair, the Succeſs of which, was of ſo dear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to Her Majeſty as the ſecuring both the Court of <hi>Hanover</hi> and Her own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of Her hearty Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Relation to the Act of Settlement. When that Court beheld in Your Lordſhip ſo glorious an Example of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Greatneſs, how were they exalted to think what a People they were one Day to Govern, tho' may that be late. They began to think
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:12"/>
ſome of their future Subjects equal to Foreign Princes, and Your Lordſhip was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd with the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which are paid to them.</p>
            <p>The great Things which Your Lordſhip has done for uniting the Prince and the Succeſſour, the Prince and the People, and the People among one another, and for reſiſting the Force and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Common Enemy, ought in gratitude to unite the Inclinations of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men to Your Lordſhip. To whom we have all ſo great Obligations, that we cannot ſo much as pay or receive the very leaſt Summ without reflecting
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:13"/>
on our Engagements to the late King, and to You; to the late King, whoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage we ſee upon every ſingle Piece, and to Your Lordſhip who plac'd it there; when in the midſt of the publick Indigence (an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence like that of <hi>Tantalus</hi> that plagued us in the midſt of Plenty, when the Miſer rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in full Bags might then firſt be truly ſaid to be lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poor) Your Lordſhip by a political and noble Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my tranſmuted Pewter and ſordid Braſs to Silver and fine Gold, and by an Action ſo great and ſo beneficent, ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cur'd real Property to thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:14"/>
at Home, who had but the Shadow of it before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd and reſtor'd the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Credit of the Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Since My Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer by his admirable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Nerves of War, is ſo juſtly ſaid to have had ſo great a ſhare in the glorious Succeſſes of the late Campaigns, Your Lordſhip ſure muſt have no ſmall one, ſince without what you have done, there could be no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</p>
            <p>Theſe, My Lord, are the publick Reaſons for Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the following Poem to Your Lordſhip. There is a private one, and that is, that
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:15"/>
when a Man contracts ſo great a Debt as to make him Inſolvent, the leaſt thing that he can do is to acknowledge what he can never pay; thus Bankrupts, when they can make no other return, ſend their Creditors an Epiſtle. I have lately had very great Obligations to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: You have been pleas'd to take ſome care of my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at a Time when I moſt wanted it, and had leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect it from You, ſince ſeveral things hinder'd my giving that conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on You, which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly exact from thoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:16"/>
Inferiour Rank, and with which, when Your Lordſhip is generouſly pleas'd to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, You plainly Declare, that Your Noble Notions of Liberty are not embrac'd by You as they are by many, either out of Pride, or on the account of Intereſt, but by a Principle of Exalted Reaſon, and Goodneſs, and Humanity. This is the firſt Opportunity which I have had ſince I receiv'd Your Favours of paying my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to You in ſo publick a manner, which I deſire Your Lordſhip to accept with Your uſual Goodneſs. But how falſe or
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:17"/>
how bounded is Human Virtue! And how few are Grateful without a Deſign of engaging their Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors or others to Heap more Benefits on them, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they can be ſenſible of them. This very Addreſs to Your Lordſhip is not without an Intention of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging You whoſe Judgment in theſe Matters is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by all the World, to defend, as far as Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will give You leave, one of the Boldeſt Poems that has been writ for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years. But I who konw the vaſt Buſineſs in which You are engag'd, am preſuming

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THough the attempt which I have made in the following Poem is very bold, yet I would not have the Reader believe it Raſh. I think my ſelf obliged, then to ſatisfie him without any Delay, that it is by no means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be a juſt Epick Poem. I know too little of the Nature of that Poem, and too much of my own infirmity ever to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to write one. But tho' this can by no means paſs for a juſt Epick Poem, yet is it ſomething of the Epick Kind, and bears the ſame proportion to a juſt Poem that a ſhort and a faint Eſſay do's to a full and a perfect Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0388000900:20"/>
That which threw me into this way of writing was the very Subject of the Poem. The Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> has laid ſuch High Obligations upon his Country, that nothing can be ſaid too much of him, nor done too much for him. And this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to endeavour to do ſomething more Bold and more Great, than any thing that I had endeavoured to do former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>But no Poem that is not Religious can be great without extravagance or bold without raſhneſs, which has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly prov'd. But there were but two ways of writing a Religious Poem upon this Occaſion. The one was to do it by way of Hymn, and the other was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Machines. The former being anticipated in the Poem which I wrote on the Battle of <hi>Bleinem</hi>; there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0388000900:21"/>
But here I eaſily foreſee that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Objection will be made, and that is, that ſince what the Duke of <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> has done is in its ſelf ſo great and ſo wonderful, what occaſion was there to endeavour to adorn it by Fiction. To which I anſwer, that becauſe what the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> has done is in its ſelf ſo wonderful that it appears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and Truth it ſelf has the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Fable and of Fiction, for that very Reaſon I was encouraged to embelliſh it with the Ornaments of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This is the Defence that <hi>Boileau</hi> has made for himſelf in his fourth Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, for introducing Machines into his Deſcription of the Paſſage of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> And if the Apology ſtands good for him, as it has always paſt hitherto, it is ſtill better for me. For my Machines are Chriſtian whereas his are Pagan, and conſequently can raiſe no great Emotion in the Minds of the Readers, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:22"/>
they are incredible, according to one of his own Verſes.</p>
            <q>
               <l>L' eſprit n'eſt point emu de ce qu'il ne croit pas.</l>
            </q>
            <p>If any one objects that what I make my Machines ſay and act will no more be believed than what <hi>Boileau</hi> Attributes to the God of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that though things did not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally paſs before and in the Battle of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millies,</hi> as they are related here, yet he who believes the Chriſtian Religion and a particular Providence, and Reflects upon a hundred Paſſages in the Old and new Teſtament, muſt allow, that there paſt ſomething not altogether unlike it. We ſee it is the Opinion of the Duke himſelf, that the Hand of God was in it, that Heaven, which leaves moſt Events to common Cauſes, was immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this. Now can any thing be more reaſonable for one who believes that
<pb facs="tcp:0388000900:23"/>
Heaven was immediately concerned on one ſide, than to believe that Hell, which our Religion tells us is always for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the great Deſigns of Heaven, was immediately concerned on the other. Thus the Deſign of this Poem is built and the Machines are introduced upon what happened to the Duke in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and what he himſelf wrote to one of our Miniſters of State after it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given an Account of the Deſign of this Poem; How well that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is executed, I muſt leave to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As I have conſulted my Friends who are fam'd for their Judgment in things of this Nature, as to what relates to the firſt four Books, and have had them by me long enough to form ſome Judgment of them my ſelf, I know the Fort and the Foible of them. For the fifth I have neither had it by me long enough to make any Judgment of it my ſelf, nor have I had time enough to conſult my

Friends about it. And therefore if there is any thing amiſs in it, I muſt leave it to the indulgence of the Candid Reader. I only deſire him to take notice, that having formerly deſcrib'd with all the Application of which I was capable, a Battle gain'd by the ſame General, I was obliged to take a very different method in this Poem. I have only this to add, that I have not ſaid ſo much as I thought to have done, of the Important Conſequnces of the Battle of <hi>Ramellies,</hi> becauſe I have ſome thoughts of writing a Pindarick Poem upon that great Action of <hi>Quintus Flaminius,</hi> which reſtored Liberty to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Citties. Between which Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Roman</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> a very juſt Parallel may be drawn.</p>
