            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I PREFIX this addreſs in order to induce you, before you paſs ſentence on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages, to read them through: <hi>"Strike, but hear!"</hi> To enable you to do this I have deſired my publiſhers to ſend each of you a copy; for, though you may have <hi>Jack the Giant-killers coat,</hi> it has never been ſuſpected that you poſſeſs <hi>Fortunatus's purſe;</hi> and the title of a book, read in a newſpaper, or through a ſhop-window, may not be always a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for unqualifyed condemnation and virulent abuſe.</p>
            <p>On ſecond thoughts, however, I believe I might as well have ſaved them the trouble; ſince you will, moſt probably, allow Mr. Malone the grateful pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of reviewing it himſelf: the virtue and honour
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0559100800:4"/>of this literary hero frequently condeſcending to bring down an unſuſpicious enemy from the maſked battery of a Review. And yet, I ſee, one of your "gangs"<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe <hi>ſocieties of gentlemen</hi> (as they modeſtly intitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) are, with equal juſtice and ability, characteriſed by Dr. Brown as—"two notorious gangs of <hi>monthly</hi> and <hi>critical</hi> book-thieves, hackney'd in the ways of wickedneſs, who, in the rage of hunger and malice, firſt <hi>plunder,</hi> and then <hi>abuſe, maim,</hi> or <hi>murder,</hi> every honeſt author who is poſſeſſed of ought worth their <hi>carrying off;</hi> yet ſkulking among other vermin in <hi>cellars</hi> and <hi>garrets,</hi> keep their perſons tolerably out of ſight, and thus <hi>eſcape</hi> the hands of <hi>literary juſtice.</hi>" ESTIMATE OF THE MANNERS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE TIMES, vol.

                  <l>Nor ſets down aught in malice.</l>
               </q>
That you "nothing extenuate," unleſs it be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of yourſelves or your employers, I can eaſily believe; but the next line certainly requires, if not a different reading, an oppoſite conſtruction. It ſuits your purpoſe, no doubt, to delude the unwary by falſe colours; as the devil, when he commences innkeeper, hangs out an angel for his ſign. The real meaning, however, is that you
<q>—ſet down <hi>ALL</hi> in malice.</q>
Shakſpears morality, in the hands of a Reviewer, is to be read backward, like a witch's prayer.</p>

For, though a literary proſtitute be, in reality, a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable character, I cannot but conſider you in, if not a far ſuperior, at leaſt, a very different light;—as two formidable, in ſhort, and miſchievous gangs of nocturnal banditti, or inviſible footpads, equally cowardly and malignant, who attack when there can be no defence, and aſſaſſinate or deſtroy where you cannot plunder. And yet, ſurpriſing as it is, while offenders of comparative inſignificance are almoſt every day expoſed on pillories, or periſhing in dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, you have the luck to eſcape the reſentment of the injured, and the vengeance of the law! Upon my word, gentlemen, I admire your good fortune, though I cannot perſuade myſelf you deſerve it; and, indeed, as guilt is only hardened by impunity, the ſooner, I think, you are brought to juſtice the better. Nor is this event, perhaps, at ſo great a diſtance as you may imagine: even <hi>the Monſter,</hi> you know, was caught at laſt; and, though you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conceive this <hi>brother aſſaſſin</hi> to have been as inferior to you in cunning, as he certainly was in criminality, it will not be amiſs to let his fate be a warning to you.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make no apology for having taken up ſo much of your time, which would, moſt probably, have been worſe employed. You may now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0559100800:6"/>to gratify your malice, and take your revenge; and (as I know you are fond of Scripture quotations) <hi>the Lord reward you according to your works!</hi>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MR. MALONE, in the year 1780, when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a <hi>Supplement to Shakſpeare</hi> of plays which he never wrote, modeſtly remarked that <hi>by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent collation of all the old copies thitherto diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the judicious reſtoration of ancient readings, the text of this author ſeemed then finally ſettled.</hi> Since that period, however, he has been labouring "with unceaſing ſolicitude," for the ſpace of "eight years" to convince the public that he had, if not directly aſſerted the thing which was not, at leaſt gone a little further than was conſiſtent with the exact ſtate of the caſe. For, if the text had been already <hi>diligently collated</hi> with <hi>all the old copies,</hi> why ſhould he make ſuch a parade of having collated it himſelf? If it had not been ſo collated, why ſhould he ſay it had? This fact is therefor manifeſt, upon Mr. Malones own evidence, that the text of Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare had never been collated, whether diligently or not, with all or any of the old copies, by any perſon before Mr. Malone. To which one may add that even this great critics collation has not been either ſo diligent or ſo ſucceſsful as he would
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0559100800:8"/>induce us to believe;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Of this the following inſtances, occaſionally noticed, in the <hi>two firſt</hi> vols. may ſerve as the ſpecimen of a proof:
<list>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 80. "If <hi>thou</hi> be pleas'd"—Both the folios read—<hi>you.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 140. "For love is ſtill <hi>more</hi> precious in itſelf."—The old editt. agree in reading—<hi>moſt.</hi>
                        </item>

                        <item>"<hi>Launce.</hi> That's as much as to ſay, can ſhe <hi>ſo.</hi>" Both the folios read <hi>ſow,</hi> which is manifeſtly requiſite. Probably, however, the editor may ſuppoſe <hi>ſew</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> to have the ſame pronunciation.</item>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 155. "And that <hi>I cannot</hi> help." In the old editions—<hi>cannot I.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 174. "As eaſily as I do tear <hi>this</hi> paper." Both folios read—<hi>his.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 70. "But grace being the ſoul of your complexion <hi>ſhould</hi> keep the body of it ever fair."—In the folios—<hi>ſhall.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 71. "Let me hear you ſpeak <hi>further.</hi>" Both edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—<hi>farther;</hi> a word entirely different from <hi>further,</hi> though too frequently confounded with it by ignorant perſons: the one being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative of <hi>forth;</hi> the other a corruption of <hi>farer.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 143. "In what ſafe place you have <hi>diſpos'd</hi> my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney." The old editions read—<hi>beſtow'd</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 151. "If it be, ſir, <hi>pray</hi> eat none of it." In the folio—<hi>I pray.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 157. "Ay let none enter"—The old copies—Ay, <hi>and</hi> let.</item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 190. "And much different from the man he was," The folios read: "And much <hi>much</hi> different;"—the additional ſyllable being neceſſary to the metre, which the editor could not perceive.</item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. <hi>Ibi.</hi> "And <hi>therefore</hi> came it that the man was mad." In the old copies—"And <hi>thereof</hi> came it."</item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 477. "Through the foreſt have I gone, "But Athenian <hi>found</hi> I none." All the old editions read—<hi>find,</hi> which is not only more elegant but more grammatical.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is not reaſon to believe that each of the remaining volumes would not have contributed an equal number of theſe damning proofs; but in fact the ſearch required too large a portion of both time and patience.</p>
               </note> and alſo that it would have been much better for the ſaid text if he had never collated it at all. By a <hi>judicious reſtoration of ancient readings,</hi> Mr. Malone ſeems to underſtand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of all the groſs and palpable blunders of the firſt folio, from which it has been the labour of ſuch
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0559100800:9"/>critics as Rowe, Pope, Theobald, Warburton, and Hanmer to purge the text. Mr. Malone is a critic of a very different deſcription.</p>
            <p>I have thought proper, in the following pages, to make a few obſervations on ſome of Mr. Malones notes. Now Mr. Malone will take this exceedingly ill; for Mr. Malone has a very high opinion of himſelf, and a very mean one of every body elſe. But I confeſs I do not ſeek to pleaſe Mr. Malone: I wiſh to reſcue the language and ſenſe of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable author from the barbariſm and corruption they have acquired in paſſing through the hands of this incompetent and unworthy editor. In a word, I mean to convict and not to convince him.</p>
            <p>The total want of <hi>ear</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> under which Mr. Malone will be found to labour, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly a natural defect, for which he would be an
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0559100800:10"/>object rather of pity than of reprehenſion, if he had not forced himſelf into an employment for which ear and judgement were eſſential, and nature, of courſe, in depriving him of thoſe indiſpenſable requiſites, had utterly diſqualifyed him. Want of courage, in a common man, may be conſidered as mere weakneſs of nerves; in a commander, it is puniſhed with death.</p>
            <p>But it is not the want of ear and judgement only of which I have to accuſe Mr. Malone: he ſtands charged with divers other high crimes and miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors againſt the divine majeſty of our ſovereign lord of the drama; with deforming his text, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading his margin, by intentional corruption, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant miſrepreſentation, malignant hypercriticiſm, and unexampled ſcurrility. Theſe charges ſhall be proved—not, as Mr. Malone proves things, by groundleſs opinion and confident aſſertion, but—by fact, argument, and demonſtration. How ſayeſt thou, culprit? Guilty or not guilty?</p>
            <p>Whoever may think fit to cenſure the language of theſe "criticiſms," Mr. Malone has no ſuch right; having himſelf rifled the blooming beds of Billings-gate to grace his commentaries with the choiceſt rhetorical flowers.<note n="*" place="bottom">He ſeldom introduces the author of the <hi>Remarks,</hi> &amp;c. without a compliment on his <hi>profound ignorance</hi> or <hi>crude notions,</hi> the <hi>feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his attempts at jocularity,</hi> the <hi>ſlenderneſs of his criticiſm,</hi> and the like; or the favourite epithet of <hi>a ſhallow</hi> or <hi>half-informed remarker.</hi> "And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges."</note> It is ſurely lawful to return an
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0559100800:11"/>enemy the ſhot of his own poiſoned arrows: and, as for the reſt, whatever reſpect may be due to the errors of genius, the blunders of ignorance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption deſerve no quarter.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> Since theſe ſheets were printed off, Mr. Malone has iſſued propoſals for a new and ſplendid edition of the plays and poems of this admired author, IN FIFTEEN VOLUMES ROYAL QUARTO!!! The reciprocal good opinion which the public and Mr. Malone appear to entertain of each other does both parties infinite honour; the one from his ſingular confidence, the other from its refined taſte. Having ſufficiently, and, I truſt, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily, proved how peculiarly qualifyed this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious gentleman is for an editor of our great poet, I have only to add my ſincereſt wiſhes that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of ſo magnificent a work may happen in time to afford me another equally favorable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of giving my humble teſtimony to his very extraordinary merit.</p>

                     <p>THERE cannot well be a more flagrant proof of diſingenuity in the ſupport of a particular opinion than is here manifeſted by the editor in his treatment of the <hi>ſecond folio,</hi> in order to ſubſtantiate his poſition "that the editor of that book was intirely ignorant of our poet phraſeology and metre; and that various alterations were made by him, in conſequence of that ignorance, which render his edition of no value whatever." Many of the inſtances adduced in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this aſſertion are mere ſelf-evident errors of the preſs, the accidental omiſſion or inſertion of a ſingle word, or the inadvertent tranſpoſition of a couple of letters;<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0559100800:13"/>equally ſubject; and conſequently prove that editors ignorance much leſs than his accuſers malice; which is the more remarkable as he has actually availed himſelf of a very conſiderable number of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the identical edition which he thus anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously labours to depreciate as a ſink of ignorance and corruption. It muſt be evident, that by this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial mode of proceeding, the ſame charge might be brought home not only to the firſt folio, but to almoſt any edition of any author. A perſon who had only truth and juſtice in view would have exhibited a faithful ſtatement, a fair debtor and creditor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the merits and defects of the two editions. But this method, Mr. Malone is conſcious, ſo far from anſwering his purpoſe, would have completely disproved and give the <hi>lye direct</hi> to his accuſation; ſince, in fact, for <hi>one</hi> inſtance of an alteration for the worſe it will be eaſy to produce <hi>ten</hi> inſtances of alterations for the better, and ſuch, at the ſame time, as not only no ignorant or capricious perſon, but not even a man of ſenſe and ſagacity would have hit upon, without the aſſiſtance of manuſcript correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or perſonal information: and after all, it is not in the leaſt improbable that both editions were printed by one and the ſame perſon, there being only <hi>nine</hi> years difference in their dates, and the one, whether intentionally or otherwiſe, juſt as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate as the other. Both editors, at leaſt, if two there were, were Shakſpeares contemporaries; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0559100800:14"/>his acquaintance; poſſibly his friends; and, in all events, equally familiar with the language of his time and his peculiar phraſeology. But, leaving Mr. Malones partiality and ingratitude out of the queſtion, I am by no means diſpoſed to admit his judgement as to any ones ignorance of Shakſpeares phraſeology and metre: in neither of which, I believe, we ſhall find him a proficient. Some of theſe identical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances prove the direct reverſe of what they are brought to do, and convict the proſecutor of both ignorance and malignity.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. "His[<hi>i. e.</hi> the ſecond editors] ignorance of Shakſpeares phraſeology" conſiſts in printing—</p>
                     <p>"I can go <hi>no</hi> further," inſtead of "I can <hi>not</hi> go <hi>no</hi> further;"</p>
                     <p>"<hi>I</hi> appointed him," inſtead of "<hi>I am</hi> appointed him," the ſyllable having ſlipped out in the preſs:</p>
                     <p>"The way to <hi>ſtudy</hi> death," inſtead of "the way to <hi>duſty</hi> death;" a mere accidental tranſpoſition of two letters; which is conſtantly happening. The following is of more conſequence.</p>
                     <p>"The ſeventh [fifth] ſcene of the fourth act of this play <hi>[Antony and Cleopatra]</hi> concludes with theſe words:—"Diſpatch,—Enobarbus!" Anthony, who, is the ſpeaker, deſires his attendant <hi>Eros</hi> to diſpatch, and then pronounces the name <hi>Enobarbus,</hi> who had recently deſerted him, and whoſe loſs he here la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But there being no perſon in the ſcene but Eros, and the point being inadvertently omitted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0559100800:15"/>after the word <hi>diſpatch,</hi> the editor of the ſecond folio ſuppoſed that Enobarbus muſt have been an error of the preſs, and therefore reads;
<q>"Diſpatch, <hi>Eros.</hi>"</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such is Mr. Malones account of the matter, in which it is only neceſſary to ſupply a ſmall omiſſion of the very accurate writer, <hi>viz.</hi> that the line, of which the two words in queſtion are part, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for metre, of which he is too good a judge for the omiſſion to have been deſigned. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, however, would be defeated by the word <hi>Enobarbus;</hi> unleſs we are to accent it thus:
<q>
                           <l>—my fortunes have</l>
                           <l>Corrupted honeſt men. Diſpatch.—<hi>Eno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rbu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
Antony is continually repeating the name of Eros; he does it no leſs than five times in the preceding ſcene, and once before in this. The manuſcript, it is probable, had, in this place, only an <hi>E.</hi> of which the original printer improperly made <hi>Enobarbus:</hi> this miſtake muſt have been ſome how or other made known to the editor of the ſecond folio, moſt likely by a MS. correction in the copy he printed from; he has therefor rightly corrected the word, but, at the ſame time, has neglected to obſerve the tranſpoſition which had been made by his predeceſſor (ſuppoſing the printer of each copy two different perſons). Take the line, therefor, as Shakſpeare
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0559100800:16"/>gave it, and let us acknowlege our obligation to the ſecond folio, for ſo valuable an alteration:
<q>Corrupted honeſt men.—<hi>Eros! diſpatch.</hi>
                        </q>
If he had meant that Anthony ſhould apoſtrophiſe his abſent officer, he would have given it thus:
<q>Corrupted honeſt men.—<hi>O Enobarbus!</hi>
                        </q>
The editor of the ſecond folio was therefor right in ſuppoſing, if indeed he was not ſure, "that Eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbus muſt have been an error of the preſs."</p>
                     <p>"In <hi>K. Henry VIII.</hi> are theſe lines
<q>
                           <l>"—If we did think</l>
                           <l>"His <hi>contemplation</hi> were above the earth,—"</l>
                        </q>
Not underſtanding this phraſeology, and ſuppoſing that <hi>were</hi> muſt require a noun in the plural number, he reads:
<q>
                           <l>"—If we did think</l>
                           <l>His <hi>contemplations</hi> were above the earth, &amp;c."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, one would be glad to know where there is a ſingle perſon to be found, ſetting aſide this petulant dogmatiſt, who ever heard of ſuch a phraſeology, or who does not know "that <hi>were</hi> muſt require a noun in the plural number."</p>
                     <p>It would be well if charges of no better founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or greater ſtrength could be brought againſt the ignorance of M. Malone.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0559100800:17"/>II. "Let us now examine how far he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>metre</hi> of theſe plays." Ay marry, now for it; this is a ſubject upon which we are quite at home.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>"In the <hi>Winter's Tale,</hi> we find,—</l>

                        <l>"In leads, or oils?"—</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>"Not knowing that <hi>fires</hi> was uſed as a diſſyllable he added the word <hi>burning</hi> at the end of the line."</p>
                     <p>He did ſo; and it will be evident to every one who can read that the addition was abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in point of quantity, to the perfection of the line. Mr. Malone can <hi>not</hi> read, and is totally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the conſequences of his own abſurd ideas; he could never elſe have thought ſuch a line as the following conſiſtent with the laws of metre:
<q>"What wheels? racks? <hi>fi-ers?</hi> what <hi>flay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? boiling?</hi>
                        </q>
Thus, however, he inſiſts that Shakſpeare intended us to read—<hi>ſwor-en, cha-rums,</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſworn, charms; ſu-ar,</hi> for <hi>ſure,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. converting one ſyllable into two, two into three or four and ſo on.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of
<q>"And ſo to <hi>arms,</hi> victorious <hi>noble</hi> father,"</q>
with the <hi>ſecond</hi> folio, we are to read

                        <q>"And ſo to <hi>a-rums, vic-to-ri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-ous</hi> father,"</q>
becauſe <hi>noble,</hi> or ſome other word of equal quantity, has been omited by the printer of the <hi>firſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inſtead of
<q>"<hi>But</hi> prove it, <hi>Henry,</hi> and thou ſhalt be king."</q>
As given by the editor of the ſecond folio, "not knowing Henry to be uſed as a triſyllable," we are to read:
<q>"Prove it <hi>He-ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-ry,</hi> and ſhalt be king."</q>
                     </p>

                        <hi>pours</hi> being a diſſyllable, we are to adopt the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harmonious line:

                     <p>Inſtead of
<q>She's tickled now, her fume <hi>can</hi> need no ſpurs.</q>
he thinks it more in the authors manner to read:

                     </p>
                     <p>"The editor, indeed" he ſays, "was even igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the author's manner of accenting words, for in the <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> where we find,

                           <l>"—Spirits, which by mine art</l>

                        </q>
he exhibits the ſecond line thus:
<q>"I have from <hi>all</hi> their <hi>cònfines</hi> call'd to enact."</q>
It is ſomewhat lucky, however, for the editor of the ſecond folio, that we are able to produce in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence no leſs deciſive a teſtimony than that of Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare himſelf. The word in queſtion occurs in <hi>Julius Caeſar:</hi>
                        <q>
                           <l>"And Caeſar's ſpirit, ranging for revenge,</l>
                           <l>"Shall, on theſe <hi>cònfines,</hi> with a monarch's voice,</l>
                           <l>"Cry havock, and let ſlip the dogs of war."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reader will now judge for himſelf which of theſe two editors, the proſecutor or defendant, is moſt ignorant of his authors "phraſeology, metre," and "manner of accenting words."</p>
                     <p>"Had he conſulted the original quarto," ſays M. Malone, "he would have found that the poet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0559100800:20"/>wrote"—ſo and ſo. Well, but how if he could not get, or never heard of the original quarto? how then? Had he not, in common with every other edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the right of ſupplying imperfections or correcting miſtakes, according to the beſt of his judgement? It is no imputation upon the ſagacity of Dr. Thirlby or ſir Thomas Hammer that they have ſuggeſted readings, which, however plauſible, are diſproved by the more recent diſcovery of the old quartos: all of which have not been yet ſeen, even by Mr. Malone; who has, at the ſame time, been indebted to chance or favour for many of the others; for which he has not, on every occaſion, made the moſt grateful or liberal return.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now proceed to make the editor of the ſecond folio ſome amends for the injuſtice, malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and perſonal abuſe of his Hibernian adverſary, by diſplaying a few inſtances not only of his actual ſuperiority to his predeceſſor (if, in fact, either edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had any other editor than the compoſitor of the preſs), but alſo where that ſuperiority is admitted by Mr. Malones own adoption. The latter caſe is diſtinguiſhed by an aſteriſk. It was once my intention to have given, what Mr. Malone ought to have done, a fair and faithful collation of the various readings of the two editions; but the ſpace and preſs-work required even by the following ſpecimen and the neceſſity I ſhould have thought myſelf under of going through them a ſecond time, which no one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0559100800:21"/>needs to be told is a word of time and patience, will be a ſufficient apology for not having carryed it into effect at preſent. However, as Mr. Malone has preſerved all the <hi>errors</hi> of the ſecond folio, and I ſhall exhibit a conſiderable number, at leaſt, of its <hi>emendations,</hi> the reader will, between us, have a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably complete view of the controverſy. The firſt reading is that of the folio 1623, the other that of the folio 1632.</p>

                     <p>"The Quip Modeſt, &amp;c."</p>
                     <p>☜ "THE author of this pamphlet, after a few copies had got abroad, had the <hi>modeſty</hi> to ſuppreſs it. Some time afterwards, repenting as it were of his repentance, he iſſued it out. One inſtance may be ſufficient to ſhew his <hi>profound ignorance</hi> of the poet whom he attempted to illuſtrate; he ſuppoſed the words <hi>ignomy</hi> and <hi>intergatory,</hi> in a late edition of Shakſpeare, to be errours of the preſs! So, when the clown in <hi>Meaſure for Meaſure</hi> ſays "there were but two ſtew'd prunes in the houſe, which at that very <hi>diſtant</hi> time ſtood, as it were in a fruit-diſh, &amp;c. this Remarker for <hi>diſtant</hi> would read <hi>inſtant.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>The veracity of this note is no leſs remarkable than its decency. That the author of the pamphlet in queſtion ever "had the modeſty to ſuppreſs it" is an abſolute falſehood, known to his printer, his bookſeller, and all who bought it. The truth is that, "after a few copies were got abroad," the further ſale was delayed till a leaf could be reprinted, in which ſome erroneous references had been detected, and an expreſſion uſed which was thought too ſtrong for the perſon alluded to, even if that perſon had been Mr. Malone, and another added to convict the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0559100800:39"/>editor or reviſer of the "late edition" of a groſs and wilful miſrepreſentation. All this might take up a week, when the publication was continued. As to the reſt, both Mr. Malone and the author of that pamphlet may have ſufficient reaſon to wiſh that neither of them had ever betrayed more <hi>profound ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of this great poet than in barely prefering the reading of one edition to that of another. That <hi>ignominy,</hi> the correction of the ſecond folio, and of which <hi>ignomy</hi> is every where either a contraction or a corruption, is requiſite in the preſent inſtance will be evident to all, except Mr. Malone, and perhaps the editor (or reviſer) of the edition in queſtion, from the line itſelf:
<q>
                           <hi>"Ignòminy</hi> in ranſom and free pardon."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Intergatories,</hi> is likewiſe nothing more than a contraction of <hi>interrogatories,</hi> as Shakſpeare would always have written it, if his metre had not required the ſacrifice of a ſyllable, which proſe does not. So, in <hi>K. John:</hi>
                        <q>"What earthly name to <hi>interrògatories.</hi>"</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Inſtant</hi> is alſo the reading of the ſecond folio, and of every other edition before that of 1785. As however it was thought <hi>diſtant</hi> might be intentional, the inſtance was omitted in the cancel.</p>
                     <p>After all, if the <hi>"Quipſters ignorance"</hi> of his author was ſo <hi>"profound,"</hi> why has this infallible
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0559100800:40"/>judge adopted any of his remarks or ſuggeſtions, ſometimes word for word, and elſewhere with <hi>ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approbation,</hi> or at ſecond-hand.

                     </p>
                     <p>"THIS piece," Mr. Malone obſerves, "ſhould ſeem to have been written by the tinker in <hi>The Taming of the Shrew,</hi> who talks of <hi>Richard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror."</hi> Unfortunately, however, the obſervation is but one out of many inſtances of our "half-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed" editors pleaſantry being occaſioned by his ignorance. He ſuppoſes <hi>Richard</hi> a blunder for <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> becauſe he does not know that there is ſuch a perſonage as <hi>Richard the Confeſſor;</hi> whereas there are no leſs than <hi>four Confeſſors of that name,</hi> any of whom might have been, and one certainly was, the hero of the above play. In the firſt place there is ſaint <hi>Richard the Confeſſor,</hi> an imaginary king of England, ſuppoſed to be buried at Lucca, where he is ſaid to have dyed on his return from a pilgrimage to Rome. Another was biſhop of Chicheſter; a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0559100800:41"/>third of St. Andrews in Calabri; and the fourth hermit of Hampole near Doncaſter, whoſe ſomni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous lucubrations have contributed in no ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the bulk of Mr. Wartons <hi>Hiſtory of Engliſh Poetry.</hi> All of theſe are expreſsly ſtiled <hi>Confeſſors</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh Martyrologe,</hi> 1608, and other books of the ſame caſt: ſo that the editors "attempt at jocularity" is as "feeble" as his "ignorance" is "profound."</p>

                        <p>The elder folio regulates the paſſage thus:
<q>
                              <l>Go make thyſelf like a nymph o'th' ſea:</l>
                              <l>Be ſubject to no ſight but thine and mine; inviſible</l>
                              <l>To every eye-ball elſe.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond reads:
<q>—like <hi>to</hi> nymph o'th' ſea.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now comes our Iriſh editor, and pronounces as poſitively as if he had been at the copyiſts or compoſitors elbow that the words <hi>be ſubject</hi> were transfered to the ſecond line "by the careleſsneſs of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0559100800:42"/>the tranſcriber or printer." "The regulation that <hi>I</hi> have made," ſays he, "ſhews that the addition [of the ſecond folio] was unneceſſary."</p>
                        <p>The only difference between the editor of the ſecond folio and Mr. Malone is that the former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the metre of the only defective line, and the latter has deſtroyed that of each. Had this "very fond and ſkill-leſs" editor poſſeſſed one thouſandth part of the ſenſe and ſagacity he aſſumes the credit of, he would have perceived that the blunder of the tranſcriber or printer conſiſted, not in tranſpoſing the words <hi>be ſubject,</hi> but, in the inſertion of two other ſyllables which certainly have no buſineſs there, and could not poſſibly have come from Shakſpeare, unleſs Shakſpeare had written like Mr. Malone. "The regulation that <hi>I</hi> have made ſhews that the addition was neceſſary:" I appeal to thoſe who have ears:
<q>
                              <l>Go make thyſelf like to a nymph o'th' ſea,</l>
                              <l>Be ſubject to no ſight but mine, inviſible</l>

                        </p>

The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the line is manifeſtly and ſimply perfect, as conſiſting of ten monoſyllables, alternately ſhort and long: ſo that it is abſolutely impoſſible to conceive a leſs exceptionable inſtance of heroic verſe. Is this laborious octennial editor ignorant that his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors meaſure conſiſts of <hi>ten ſyllables?</hi> or is he, like many of his wild countrymen, unable to reckon to ten, or to count his fingers?

our notable critic, for the improvement of the metre, of which he is a complete judge, alters it thus:

                              <l>Point to rich ends. This my mean taſk would be</l>

                           </q>
And juſtifies the alteration by gravely telling us that "our author and his contemporaries generally uſe <hi>odious</hi> as a triſyllable." How then, will he tell us, do <hi>he</hi> and <hi>his</hi> contemporaries uſe it?</p>
                        <p>It is evident that all we get by this capricious change is a transfer to one line of the defect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; at leaſt, to make any metre of the ſecond we muſt read it thus:
<q>"As heavy to me as <hi>o-dì-ous,</hi> but;"</q>

                     <q>The human mortals want their winter here.</q>
                     <p>The poſition too haſtily advanced by Mr. Steevens of the mortality of fairies has been ſo fully and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely refuted, that I do not at all wonder to find our preſent candid and liberal editor continuing that gentlemans note, tho' I own I am not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee the ſwaggering comment in the edition of 1785 reduced to half a dozen words—</p>
                     <p>"See the <hi>Faery Queen</hi> B. II. c. 10; and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons OBSERVATIONS on Spenſer, vol. i. p. 55. REED."</p>
                     <p>And why not likewiſe to "Tickell's poem, called <hi>Kenſington Gardens,"</hi> which was to ſhew "that the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0559100800:54"/>opinion prevailed in the preſent century?"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>This poem is printed in Dodſleys Collection, of which the editor or reviſer of the edition of 1785 had been a very few years before employed in the republication. He muſt therefor know that it proved the direct reverſe of that for which he refered to it, and conſequently that he was aſſerting an untruth.</p>
                           <p>I ſhould like to know from the gentleman concerned, or any other able caſuiſt, the exact difference between aſſerting that a book proves what the aſſerter knows it diſproves, and producing, like Lauder, ſuppoſititious extracts for the purpoſe.</p>
                        </note> But the reduction and omiſſion are ſufficient to prove that our modeſt editor was himſelf convinced of the fallacy of Mr. Steevens's aſſertion, and Mr. Reeds <hi>authorities,</hi> though he has not had the candour to acknowledge it. See the <hi>Quip Modeſt.</hi> pp. 11. 33.</p>
                     <p>The paſſage three quoted from Arioſto is thus tranſlated by Sir J. Harington:
<q>
                           <l>"But (either auncient folke beleeu'd a lie,</l>
                           <l>"Or this is true) a <hi>fayrie cannot die.</hi>"</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following inſtances, from this very play, were accidentally omited:
<q>
                           <l>"But <hi>ſhe, being mortal,</hi> of that boy did die."</l>
                           <l>"I am a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of no common ſort."</l>

                     <p>If ever any poſition was or can be demonſtrated by literary evidence it is that the fairies of Shakſpeare were not ſubject to mortality. There is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whatever on the other ſide.</p>

                     <p>"According to the rules of heraldry," it is the editors note, "the <hi>firſt</hi> houſe only, (e. g. a father who has a ſon living, or an elder brother as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a younger,) has a right to bear the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily coat. The ſon's coat is diſtinguiſhed from the father's by a label; the younger brother's from the elder's by a mullet. The ſame creſt is common to both. Helena therefore means to ſay, that ſhe and her friends were as cloſely united, as much as <hi>one</hi> perſon, as if they were <hi>both of the firſt houſe;</hi> as if they both had the privilege <hi>due but to one</hi> perſon, (viz. to him of the firſt houſe,) the right of bearing the family coat without any diſtinguiſhing mark."</p>
                     <p>Every reader of this incomparable edition will have frequent occaſion to obſerve that the editor "draweth out the thread of his verboſity finer than the ſtaple of his argument." The preſent inſtance, indeed, is nothing in compariſon to pages of inanity with which the work abounds, and which, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their "true no-meaning," are actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of refutation or diſcuſſion.

Every ſubſequent edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt therefor be, at leaſt, equally ignorant; and I dare ſay, if Mr. Malone is to be the judge, there never was editor, commentator or critic of Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare who had a grain of ſenſe beſide himſelf. A
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0559100800:59"/>refutation cannot be expected of ſuch peculiar abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. "Launcelot," he ſays, "is not talking about Jeſſica's father, but about her future huſband." But how does he know this? who told him ſo? can he be better acquainted with the ſubject of Launcelots converſation than the man himſelf? He is aware, at the ſame time, that, in a ſubſequent ſcene, he ſays to Jeſſica, "Marry, you may partly hope your <hi>father got you not;</hi>" but he is now, it ſeems, on another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. That, however, is but the idle opinion of Mr. Malone; the editor of the ſecond folio, and all his ſucceſſors, and, I will venture to add, Shakſpeare himſelf, and all his readers, think very differently.</p>

A paſſage which, as it contains neither <hi>no</hi> nor <hi>mo,</hi> can not certainly prove what it is brought to do. The conſtruction adopted by this pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating critic is that though a <hi>woman</hi> has <hi>more</hi> beauty than her <hi>lover</hi> ſhe is not on that account to inſult him: an idea which one can eaſily ſuppoſe never entered into any head but his own; one would not, therefor, wiſh to deprive the preſent edition of an emendation ſo worthy of it. But, however, Mr. Malone may read, his author certainly wrote
<q>Over the wretched? what though you have beauty.</q>
He could not perceive that <hi>no</hi> or <hi>mo</hi> was as injurious to the metre, as his quotation from Lodge might have led him to ſuſpect it was to the ſenſe: though I believe he underſtands both equally well. But, I well know that "my learned friend is above taking notice of ſuch ſlender criticiſm."</p>

                     <p>Mr. Malone, no doubt, is able to perceive a great many thing which neither Mr. Pope nor any body elſe would dream of; though, if Mr. Pope did not perceive that a <hi>word of four ſyllables</hi> was a <hi>word of four ſyllables,</hi> he muſt have been a more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſon than he is generally reputed.

                     <p>The text, which is too plain to be miſunderſtood by a reader of common ſenſe, will ſpeak for itſelf, and clearly prove that neither Falſtaff nor the hoſteſs knows the prince till he ſays he is "come to draw him out by the ears."

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0559100800:79"/>having obſerved "that Shakſpeare has varied from the truth of hiſtory, to introduce this ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mortimer and Richard Plantagenet," "a half-informed <hi>Remarker</hi> on this note" (they are the words of the gentle Edmond) "ſeems to think that he has totally over-turned it, by quoting the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from Hall's <hi>Chronicle:</hi> "During which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament [held in the third year of Henry VI. 1425.] came to London Peter Duke of Quimber,—which of the Duke of Exeter, &amp;c. was highly feſted.—Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which ſeaſon Edmond Mortymer, the laſt Erle of Marche of that name, (whiche long tyme had bene reſtrayned from hys liberty and finally waxed lame) diſceaſed without yſſue, whoſe inheritance deſcended to Lord Richard Plantagenet," &amp;c. as if a circumſtance which Hall has mentioned to mark the <hi>time</hi> of Mortimer's death, neceſſarily aſcertained the <hi>place</hi> where it happened alſo. The fact is, that this Edmund Mortimer did <hi>not</hi> die in London, but at Trim in Ireland." So far, ſo good.</p>
                     <p>This teſty critic ſeems to ſmart ſo much from ſome corrections of that ſame "half-informed <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker,</hi>" that he may be readily allowed to avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of every opportunity of abuſing him, particularly where he happens to anticipate a quotation which an all-informed editor would have been glad to produce. The paſſage in Hall (and it is copyed by Hollinſhed) would be ſufficient, it was ſaid, to juſtify Shakſpeare "even if the fact were otherwiſe;" and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0559100800:80"/>ſo it undoubtedly is, notwithſtanding either the great learning or little ſcurrility of Edmond Malone. The hiſtorian does not, to be ſure, expreſsly ſay that the Earl of March dyed in the <hi>Tower;</hi> but no perſon of common ſenſe can think that he meant to relate an event which happened to a <hi>ſound, free man</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as happening to a <hi>lame priſoner</hi> during the time a particular perſon was feaſting in <hi>London.</hi> In fact, he <hi>does</hi> ſay that this nobleman <hi>dyed in priſon,</hi> and that by ſuch priſon he meant either the <hi>Tower,</hi> or ſome place of confinement at no great diſtance, is almoſt certain, not only from the circumſtance already mentioned, but from a paſſage in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding part of his book, where he expreſsly tells us that "the Erle of Marche was euer <hi>kepte in the courte</hi> vnder ſuch a keper that he could nether doo or attempte any thyng agaynſte the king without his knowledge, and dyed without iſſue." If he did not mean the <hi>Tower,</hi> let Mr. Malone ſay what priſon he did mean. To what purpoſe is it that the actual truth was otherwiſe? Our author had neither <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> nor <hi>Dugdale,</hi> nor <hi>Sandford,</hi> to conſult, and it cannot ſurely be expected that he ſhould have gone to examine the record office: He naturally took for fact what he found in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and if the hiſtorian were but <hi>half-informed,</hi> how could he help it? He was writing a play, not a chronicle. I know, much better, I am perſuaded, than Mr. Malone, how little either Hall or Hollinſhed is to be depended on in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0559100800:81"/>matter of fact. Is the death of Edmond Mortimer of greater conſequence than the intended marriage of lady Bona, or the capture, impriſonment and eſcape of K. Edward IV. both which are abſolutely fabulous and without the ſlighteſt poſſible founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And why is not Shakſpeare, who has adopted theſe two lying ſtories, charged with having in theſe inſtances "varyed from the truth of hiſtory?" The remark was natural enough to Mr. Edwards, who did not know what ſort of hiſtories our author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted; neither indeed is the editors defence of it otherwiſe, being a pedantic parade of hiſtorical knowledge picked up for the occaſion, to faſten Shakſpeare with a charge which every one muſt think frivolous, and which he knew to be unjuſt.</p>

                     <p>The editor of the ſecond folio, then, has had the uſe of his ears, which is more than can be ſaid of his Hibernian ſucceſſor. It requires a certain degree of folly, peculiar to this all-accompliſhed critic, not to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0559100800:82"/>perceive—that whether <hi>tickled</hi> be a diſſyllable, or a triſyllable or a quadriſyllable, cannot make the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difference; the defect of the line being in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter.—According to the hypotheſis of our Boeotian editor, we ought to read the line as follows:
<q>She's <hi>tic-kle-èd</hi> now, hèr fume needs no ſpurs.</q>

                     <p>"An anonymous Remarker," we are told, "very confidently aſſerts that "this ſcene, ſo far as reſpects Yorks <hi>oath</hi> and <hi>his reſolution to break it,</hi> proceeds entirely from the authors imagination. His oath," however, "is in record, and what his <hi>reſolution</hi> was when he marched from London at the head of a large body of men, and ſent the meſſage aboveſtated to his ſon, it is not very difficult to conjecture."</p>
                     <p>A little ſuperficial reading, and a conſummate ſtock of aſſurance authoriſe this hypercritical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator to abuſe what he does not underſtand. The "anonymous Remarker," confidently if it muſt be, aſſerts that the ſcene in queſtion, in which Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Richard perſuade their father to break his oath, had no foundation in hiſtory; and gives this reaſon for it, that, "neither the Earl of March nor Richard was then at Sandal; the latter being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a mere child, ſcarcely more than (if indeed ſo much as) nine years old:" in fact he was but juſt turned of eight. How, therefor, does the Iriſh edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, with all his pitiful caviling and malignity, pick out from theſe words that York had never taken an oath? And, though he and Warwick did leave Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0559100800:84"/>with 5 or 6,000 men, and might ſend a meſſage to his ſon to follow them, it was with the kings own authority, to ſuppreſs an inſurrection againſt the eſtabliſhed government: nor could either his attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or his defending himſelf againſt, the queen or prince be any breach of his oath. So that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markers aſſertion, however confident, is ſtrictly true; which is more than this ingenuous Hibernian can always ſay of his own, which are at the ſame time very ſeldom diſtinguiſhable by diffidence.</p>
                     <p>It is not true that the queen and prince were at York, nor do we find from any good authority that they were ſent to by the King. Though, if they had been ſent to, and, inſtead of obeying the requiſition, had employed themſelves in raiſing a rebellion, it would have been perfectly conſonant with the dukes oath and duty to have prevented or quelled it. But in fact, whatever concern the queen might have in the Yorkſhire inſurrection, ſhe did not return from Scotland till after the battle of Wakefield.</p>
                     <p>What ſort of hiſtories the Iriſh editor conſults I am at a loſs to imagine; and as he does not chooſe to cite them, I ſhall for once follow his example.<note n="*" place="bottom">I collect from another note (p. 321) where he ſays that "neither of his daughters was married at the time when Warwick was in France negotiating a marriage between lady Bona and the king," that the learned gentleman is content either with the ſame hiſtorians whom Shakſpeare uſed, or with thoſe who have followed them: Warwick <hi>never</hi> was in France for any ſuch purpoſe: as no one but ſuch a "half-informed" note-writer can be ignorant.</note>

                     <p>The reaſon of Mr. Rowes changing <hi>years</hi> to <hi>months,</hi> and inſerting <hi>weeks</hi> was not, as this equally ſuperficial and blundering commentator imagines, purely on account of the meaſure, but becauſe the king has already mentioned <hi>weeks</hi> and <hi>years,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward enumerates <hi>months.</hi> Theſe two curious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllables it muſt be confeſſed, help the metre prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously: but, in fact, the editor ſhould be expected to rehearſe his text to the purchaſer, as no one will ever be able to read it without his inſtructions.

King Richard, it is well known, had as good a title to the crown as the late king William or queen Anne, or the reigning houſe of Hanover.

"This Remarker, however," he proceeds to relate, "<hi>after a feeble attempt at jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi> and ſaying that he ſhall take no further notice of this editors <hi>ſee-ſaw conjectures,</hi> with <hi>great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> propoſes a comment evidently formed on the latter of them, as an original interpretation of <hi>his own,</hi> on which the reader may <hi>ſafely rely.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Friend Butler ſomewhere tells us, there is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument like matter of fact: we ſhall preſently ſee who is the <hi>thief.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the edition of 1778, the latter of this ingenious gentlemans "ſee-ſaw conjectures" is as follows: "The paſſage however may be explained thus:—<hi>His</hi> may refer to <hi>mine;</hi> as if he had ſaid: Your maſter's confidence was above <hi>my maſters;</hi> elſe ſurely <hi>his,</hi> i. e. the ſum <hi>demanded from my maſter</hi> (for that is the laſt antecedent) had been equal to the ſum <hi>demanded from yours.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Remark</hi> is: "Your maſter, it ſeems, had more confidence in lord Timon than mine, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, his (<hi>i. e.</hi> my maſters) debt (<hi>i. e.</hi> the ſum due to him from Timon) would, certainly, have been as great as your maſter (<hi>i. e.</hi> as the money which Timon owes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0559100800:103"/>to your maſter); that is, my maſter, being as rich as yours, could and would have advanced Timon as large a ſum as your maſter has advanced him, if he (<hi>i. e.</hi> my maſter) had thought it prudent to do ſo."</p>
                     <p>Very well: now comes "the true explication," which the editor ſays he "alſo formerly propoſed;" an aſſertion, if he mean in the edition of 1778, which is evidently untrue. The reader may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>His</hi> may refer to <hi>mine.</hi> "It ſhould ſeem that the confidential friendſhip ſubſiſting between your maſter and Timon was greater than that ſubſiſting between Timon and my maſter; elſe ſurely <hi>his</hi> ſum, i. e. the ſum <hi>borrowed</hi> from <hi>my</hi> maſter, [the laſt antecedent] had been as large as the ſum <hi>borrowed</hi> from yours."</p>
                     <p>It muſt be perfectly clear, that the Remarker could not be indebted to a note which, ſo far as it is intelligible, ſeems diametrically oppoſite to his idea. It is equally ſo, that the editor has availed himſelf of the above "ſhallow" Remark, to vary the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his "ſee-ſaw conjecture," and give it a ſenſe it would otherwiſe never have had.

                     <p>If ſuch a practice ever prevailed, I conclude it muſt have been in our luminous editors native country. It will appear a very ſtrange doctrine to the amateurs of this ſavage amuſement, that the hawk ſhould be flown at game which it was not ſuffered to ſee.

                  <p>Vol. iv. Tw. N. p. 46. He has obſerved, he ſays, that <hi>lover</hi> is elſewhere uſed by our poet as a word of one ſyllable. So, in <hi>A Midſummer Night's Dream:</hi>
                     <q>"Tie up my <hi>lover's</hi> tongue; bring him ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, in <hi>King Henry VIII.</hi>
                     <q>"Is held no great good <hi>lover</hi> of the archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,"</q>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0559100800:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>As to the firſt of theſe pretended inſtances, it proves nothing; being only (whatever he may ſay to the contrary) a miſprint for <hi>love's.</hi> And every one but this ſagacious critic will perceive that the other is to be pronounced like what it is, a word of two ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
<q>Is held no great good <hi>lover</hi> of th' archbiſhops.</q>

                     <bibl>P. 492.</bibl> His noſe was as ſharp as a <hi>pen,</hi> and 'a babbled of green fields.</q>
                  <p>On this difficult paſſage our editor had one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture which had luckily, it ſeems, eſcaped him when the play was printing, but he unfortunately recollected it in time for his appendix. It is that the word <hi>table</hi> is right, and the corrupted word <hi>and,</hi> which may have been miſprinted for <hi>in;</hi> and thus then the paſſage will mean—"and his note was as ſharp as a <hi>pen</hi> in a <hi>table</hi> of green fields." A <hi>pen</hi> may have been uſed for a <hi>pin-fold,</hi> and a table for a picture. The pointed ſtakes, he adds, of which pinfolds are ſometimes formed were perhaps in the poets thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riſum teneatis?</hi> If Shakſpeare had had the pointed ſtakes of a pinfold in his minds eye he would have mentioned it, for though the <hi>ſtake</hi> may be ſharp, the <hi>pinfold</hi> is not. But why waſte a moment in the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0559100800:114"/>conſideration of ſuch miſerable nonſenſe? Whoever knew the word <hi>pen</hi> uſed for <hi>pinfold,</hi> or a pinfold placed amidſt a parcel of green fields? We have <hi>pens</hi> for <hi>geeſe,</hi> indeed, and <hi>pens</hi> for <hi>ſheep;</hi> but no one ever before heard of the <hi>pen</hi> of an <hi>aſs.</hi>

                  <p>P. 495. "An anonymous writer," we are told, "ſuppoſes that by the words—<hi>keep cloſe,</hi> Piſtol means <hi>keep within doors.</hi> That this was not the meaning," it ſeems, "is proved deciſively by the words of the quarto."</p>
                  <p>That this is not the meaning in the quarto may be proved deciſively by the words of that edition, but the meaning of the folio is to be aſcertained by its own: ſo that the ſuppoſition may be right enough.</p>
                  <p>Such are the obſervations which I have had to make upon this moſt ſagacious of editors, and his unparalleled edition. I muſt not, however, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to ſay that I have paid equal attention to all his abſurdities. His pages abound with examples of <hi>profound ignorance, idle conjectures, crude actions, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempts at jocularity, ſlender criticiſm, ſhallow, half-informed, fond, ſkill-leſs, taſteleſs</hi> and <hi>unfounded remarks,</hi> no leſs, or poſſibly much more, worthy of contempt and deriſion than thoſe expoſed in the preſent ſheets. They can only, therefor, ſerve as a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0559100800:115"/>haſty or imperfect ſketch of what may be done by others; if indeed either Mr. Malone or his edition be intitled to any further notice. It will be eaſily ſeen that, in the courſe of this inveſtigation, "I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, as much as poſſible, to avoid all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy;" and Mr. Malone, I am ſure, has too exalted an opinion of his peculiar merits, and too ſovereign a contempt for thoſe who dare call them in queſtion, to permit that the ſerenity of his mind ſhould ſuffer a moments diſcompoſure by the appearance of an inſignificant pamphlet; well knowing that "of ſuch flimzy materials are many of the <hi>hyper-criticiſms</hi> compoſed to which the labours of the editors and commentators on Shakſpeare have given riſe."</p>
