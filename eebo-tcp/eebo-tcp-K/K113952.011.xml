            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>RIchard! of all mankind the moſt complete,</l>
                  <l>Plump as a partridge, and as ſugar ſweet,</l>
                  <l>Thy breath is fragrant as the new-mown hay,</l>
                  <l>Thy roguiſh eyes have ſtole my heart away,</l>
                  <l>Thy dunghills mounts of ſweet perfumes appear,</l>
                  <l>Thy hogs grunt muſic to my love-ſick ear;</l>
                  <l>Where'er you tread a fragrant odour flies,</l>
                  <l>Sweet as the vapour from the ſweeteſt pies.</l>
                  <l>On Sunday laſt it was you threw me down,</l>
                  <l>My apron tore, and all bedaub'd my gown,</l>
                  <l>Then would I fain have told you, you was rude,</l>
                  <l>And ſlapt your face—ah! faith I wiſh I could;</l>
                  <l>What could I do? your hugging ſtopp'd my breath,</l>
                  <l>Nor could I move, tho' I'd been hugg'd to death:</l>
                  <l>Since that dear time my heart has known no reſt,</l>
                  <l>But has been broiling in my flaming breaſt;</l>
                  <l>Since that ſweet time I neither ſleep nor eat,</l>
                  <l>I ſpoil my puddings, and I burn my meat.</l>
                  <l>What miſchief love creates in human hearts!</l>
                  <l>My maſter ſwears he cannot touch my tarts.</l>

                  <l>By day, by night, whate'er I think or do,</l>

                  <l>In vain I vow, perteſt, and ſwear in vain</l>
                  <l>They ſee my vows are much againſt the grain:</l>
                  <l>They ſee the love that I would fain conceal,</l>
                  <l>They ſee my face as white as any veal.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Then to my arms, and to my wiſhes fly,</l>

                  <l>Of fineſt flour a pudding I will make,</l>
                  <l>Store it with plumbs, and bake it for thy ſake;</l>
                  <l>For oft I've heard (oh bleſs that charming voice!)</l>
                  <l>A bak'd plumb-pudding was my Dickey's choice.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Come then, oh come! and charm my longing eyes,</l>
                  <l>Come, ſave my ſoups, my puddings, and my pyes;</l>
                  <l>One ſmile from thee my ſenſes will reſtore,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THis morn, when at the inn I'd ſold my hay,</l>
                  <l>Give me, ſays I, the paper of to-day;</l>
                  <l>But ſure it ſtruck me with a ſtrange ſurprize,</l>
                  <l>When Mary's letter met her Richard's eyes;</l>
                  <l>For, tho' thy lines to me are always dear,</l>
                  <l>I wonder'd how the devil they came there.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Much I admire th' expreſſions of thy love,</l>
                  <l>Thy praiſe beſtows a joy all joys above,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet, deareſt Mary, it is I ſhould ſay,</l>
                  <l>" Your breath is ſweeter than the new-mown hay,</l>
                  <l>" Your roguiſh eyes have ſtole my heart away."</l>
                  <l>Since from my fields your likeneſſes you take,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Your eyes ſo ſoft, ſo delicately round,</l>
                  <l>Are like two plumbs I've in a pudding found,</l>
                  <l>The jet black plumbs their heighten'd luſtre owe</l>
                  <l>To the ſurrounding pudding's cheeks of ſnow.</l>

                  <l>If Molly at the table was not plac'd:</l>
                  <l>A pudding bak'd I ever did approve,</l>
                  <l>But what's a pudding to a man in love?</l>
                  <l>Love is a flame—indeed 'tis very hot;</l>
                  <l>How my blood boils, like water in a pot?</l>
                  <l>My inward pain my pale complexion ſpeaks,</l>
                  <l>Which once was browner than a bak'd ox cheek's;</l>
                  <l>Cupud has pierc'd me with his ſharpeſt dart,</l>
                  <l>'Tis juſt as if your ſpit went thro' my heart.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Alas! how tedious ſeems the livelong day,</l>
                  <l>That keeps me from my Molly far away.</l>
                  <l>I'd fly to thee, my love—but Dobbin's lame,</l>
                  <l>Oh fate, thou lov'ſt at me thy darts to aim!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>My father calls—one word, and then adieu—</l>

            <l>THE Lord is my ſhepherd, my guardian, and guide;</l>

            <l>Ever ſince I was born, it is he that hath crown'd</l>
            <l>The life that he gave me with bleſſings all round:</l>
            <l>While yet on the breaſt a poor infant I hung,</l>
            <l>E'er time had unlooſen'd the ſtrings of my tongue,</l>
            <l>He gave me the help which I could not then aſk;</l>
            <l>Now therefore to thank him ſhall be my tongue's taſk.</l>
            <l>Thro' my tendereſt years, with as tender a care,</l>
            <l>My ſoul, like a lamb, in his boſom he bare;</l>
            <l>To the brook he would lead me, whene'er I had need,</l>
            <l>And point out the paſture where beſt I might feed:</l>
            <l>No harm could approach me; for he was my ſhield</l>
            <l>From the fowls of the air, and the beaſts of the field;</l>
            <l>The wolf, to devour me, would oftentimes prowl,</l>
            <l>But the Lord was my ſhepherd, and guarded my ſoul.</l>
            <l>How oft, in my youth, have I wander'd aſtray?</l>
            <l>And ſtill he hath brought me back to the right way!</l>
            <l>When, loſt in dark error, no path I could meet,</l>
            <l>His word, like a lantern, hath guided my feet:</l>
            <l>What wondrous eſcapes to his kindneſs I owe!</l>
            <l>When, raſh and unthinking, I ſought my own woe:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0579800311:118"/>My ſoul had, long ſince, been gone down the deep,</l>
            <l>If the Lord had not watched, when I was aſleep.</l>
            <l>Whenſoe'er, at a diſtance, he ſees me afraid,</l>
            <l>He ſkips o'er the mountain, and comes to my aid;</l>
            <l>Then leads me back gently, and bids me abide</l>
            <l>In the midſt of his flock, and feed cloſe by his ſide:</l>
            <l>How ſafe in his keeping, how happy and free,</l>
            <l>Could I always remain where he bids me to be;</l>
            <l>Yea, bleſt are the people, and happy thrice told,</l>
            <l>That obey the Lord's voice, and abide in his fold.</l>
            <l>The fold it is full, and the paſture is green;</l>
            <l>All is friendſhip and love, and no enmity ſeen:</l>
            <l>There the Lord dwells, among us, upon his own hill;</l>
            <l>With the flocks all around him awaiting his will:</l>
            <l>Himſelf, in the midſt, with a provident eye,</l>
            <l>Regarding our wants, and procuring ſupply;</l>
            <l>An abundance ſprings up of each nouriſhing bud,</l>
            <l>And we gather his gifts, and are filled with good.</l>
            <l>At his voice, or example, we move, or we ſtay,</l>
            <l>For the Lord is himſelf both our leader and way:</l>

            <l>A ſweet ſmelling ſavour inceſſantly breathe:</l>
            <l>The delight is renew'd of each ſenſible thing,</l>

            <l>A relief in due ſeaſon prevents our complaint:</l>
            <l>The rain, at his word, brings us food from the ſky,</l>
            <l>And rocks become rivers when we are adry.</l>
            <l>From the fruitfulleſt hill to the barreneſt rock,</l>
            <l>The Lord hath made all for the ſake of his flock;</l>
            <l>And the flock, in return, the Lord always confeſs</l>
            <l>In plenty their joy, and their hope in diſtreſs:</l>
            <l>He beholds in our welfare his glory diſplay'd,</l>
            <l>And we find ourſelves bleſt in obedience repay'd:</l>
            <l>With a cheerful regard, we attend to his ways,</l>

            <l>Not when the time calls me to walk thro' the vale</l>
            <l>Of the ſhadow of death, ſhall my heart ever fail;</l>
            <l>Tho' afraid, of myſelf, to purſue the dark way,</l>
            <l>Thy rod, and thy ſtaff, be my comfort and ſtay;</l>
            <l>For I know, by thy guidance, when once it is paſt,</l>
            <l>To a fountain of life it will bring me at laſt.</l>
            <l>The lord is become my ſalvation and ſong,</l>
            <l>His bleſſing ſhall follow me all my life long!</l>
            <l>Whatſoever condition he places me in,</l>
            <l>I am ſure 'tis the beſt it could ever have been:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0579800311:120"/>For the Lord he is good, and his mercies are ſure;</l>
            <l>He only afflicts us in order to cure:</l>
            <l>The Lord will I praiſe while I have any breath;</l>
            <l>Be content all my life, and reſign'd at my death.</l>

            <byline>BY SIR THOMAS BROWN, AUTHOR OF RELIGIO MEDICI.</byline>
            <l>THE night is come, like to the day,</l>
            <l>Depart not thou, great God, away;</l>
            <l>Let not my ſins, black as the night,</l>
            <l>Eclipſe the luſtre of thy light:</l>
            <l>Keep ſtill in my horizon, for to me</l>
            <l>The ſun makes not the day, but thee.</l>
            <l>Thou, whoſe nature cannot ſleep,</l>
            <l>On my temples centry keep;</l>
            <l>Guard me 'gainſt thoſe watchful foes,</l>
            <l>Whoſe eyes are open while mine cloſe.</l>
            <l>Let no dreams my head infeſt,</l>
            <l>But ſuch as Jacob's temples bleſt.</l>
            <l>While I do reſt, my ſoul advance,</l>
            <l>And make my ſleep an holy trance;</l>
            <l>That I may, my reſt being wrought,</l>
            <l>Awake into ſome holy thought;</l>
            <l>And with as active vigour run</l>
            <l>My courſe, as doth the nimble ſun.</l>
            <l>Sleep is a death; O make me try,</l>
            <l>By ſleeping, what it is to die:</l>
            <l>And as gently lay my head</l>
            <l>On my grave, as now my hed.</l>

            <l>Awake again at laſt with thee:</l>
            <l>And thus aſſur'd, behold I lie</l>
            <l>Securely, or to wake or die.</l>
            <l>Theſe are my drowſy days; in vain</l>
            <l>I now do wake, to ſleep again;</l>
            <l>O come that hour, when I ſhall never</l>

            <l>Freſh from the duſt, and ſoaring ſeek the ſkies;</l>
            <l>Then why ſhould I lament that night draws on;</l>
            <l>And, tir'd, refuſe to lay my burthen down?</l>
            <l>Tho' others more, yet I enough have ſeen,</l>

            <l>'Tis the leaſt care, of all that fills this head,</l>
            <l>What men deſign when I have ſtole to bed.</l>
            <l>Cloſing my eyes, the world I now encloſe,</l>
            <l>And Fancy, waking, murthers my repoſe;</l>
            <l>But in the grave, the houſe of rich and poor,</l>
            <l>Faſt I ſhall ſleep, and dream of life no more.</l>
