            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <l>BOLD was the man, and ſenc'd in ev'ry part</l>
               <l>With oak, and ten-fold braſs about the heart,</l>
               <l>To build a play who tortur'd firſt his brain,</l>
               <l>And then dar'd launch it on this ſtormy main.</l>
               <l>What tho', at firſt, he ſpreads his little ſails</l>
               <l>To Heav'n's indulgent and propitious gales,</l>
               <l>As the land gradual leſſens to his eye</l>
               <l>He finds a troubled ſea, and low'ring ſky:</l>
               <l>Envy, detraction, calumny, and ſpite,</l>
               <l>Ra6iſe a worſe ſtorm than when the winds unite.</l>
               <l>Around his bark, in many a dang'rous ſhoal,</l>
               <l>Thoſe monſters of the deep, the critics, prowl.</l>
               <l>"She's a weak veſſel, for theſe ſeas unfit,</l>
               <l>"And has on board her not a ſpice of wit:</l>
               <l>"She's French-built too; of foreign make," they cry;</l>
               <l>Like geeſe ſtill cackling that the Gauls are nigh.</l>
               <l>If thrown on rocks by the hoarſe daſhing wave,</l>
               <l>Th' unhappy crew no hand is ſtretch'd to ſave;</l>
               <l>But round the wreck, like Moors, with furious joy,</l>
               <l>The witlings crowd—to murder and deſtroy,</l>
               <l>Theſe are known dangers; and, ſtill full as certain,</l>
               <l>The bard meets other ills behind the curtain.</l>
               <l>Little you think, ere yet you fix his fate,</l>
               <l>What previous miſchiefs there in ambuſh wait;</l>
               <l>What plagues ariſe from all the mimic throng:</l>
               <l>"My part's too ſhort;—and, Sir, my part's too long."</l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:0057603800:4"/>This calls for incident; that repartee.</l>

               <l>Removes each obſtacle, and ſprings to light.</l>
               <l>Some ſcenes, we hope, he brings to nature true;</l>
               <l>Some gleams of humour, and a moral too;</l>
               <l>But no ſtrange monſters offers to your view:</l>
               <l>No forms, groteſque and wild, are here at ſtrife:</l>
               <l>He boaſts an etching from the real life;</l>
               <l>Exerts his efforts, in a poliſh'd age,</l>
               <l>To drive the Smithfield muſes from the ſtage;</l>
               <l>By eaſy dialogue would win your praiſe,</l>

                  <speaker>BELLFIELD.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I have your pardon in my pocket.</p>

                  <p>Oh, to be ſure, I, who claim homage from every pretty fellow, am likely to forgive the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected perſon who diſputes my title, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a vain pretender to it himſelf.</p>

                  <p>How can you talk thus, when you know I have worſhipp'd you even to idolatry, and have offer'd up prayers on my very knees to you?</p>

                  <speaker>LUCINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>But I require true devotion in your prayers. Would it not provoke the patience of a ſaint to have a well-powder'd fop kneel at his ſhrine, with a "There's a handſome fellow for you; mind my cloaths, Bruſſels lace, diamond-ring, ſaucy ſnuff-box, and impudent face?" And this too under the notion of aſking a bleſſing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>BELLFIELD.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear Lucinda, I never knew you ſo much out. Would not you have a man go to his prayers with a good conſcience? And what are the pleaſures of a good conſcience? The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of one's own heart.—Now, my dear ma'am, if, when I approach you, I have ſome ſelf-approving airs, am not I therefore the better intitled to you?</p>

                  <p>Heav'ns! I am frighten'd at you.—You are a free-thinker in love:—Preach this doctrine to the ladies, and they will call it downright hereſy.</p>

                  <p>Eaſy and impudent!—But love's religion is a ſort of popery, and requires penance, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and watching, and that you should pray for favours in a language almoſt unintelligible.—But you ſay your prayers in the vulgar tongue: "And ſo let me call the parſon." Why you might as well come moſt cavalierly to my houſe, take poſſeſſion of an arm chair, and, <q>Here, bring me my night-gown and ſlippers.</q>

                  <p>My dear Hortenſia, that is carrying it too far—you grow captious—there is no harm in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle raillery, ſure.</p>

                  <p>No, by no means; we are all very ingenious in deceiving ourſelves: Our paſſions wear ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cunning diſguiſes, we hardly know them.—Spleen ſhall paſs for wit, avarice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>So that if I ſuffer a civil thing from a pretty fellow, the pleaſure I find from the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes a quick tranſition to a liking of the man.</p>

                  <p>I beg your pardon:—There is in you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious people a ſedate love of pleaſure that we giddy creatures never come up to. We receive ſlight impreſſions, and ſlight impreſſions chatter away, and evaporate in the whirl of our fancy. Now you demure ones dwell upon what gains acceſs to your hearts; and then your thoughts are like what they tell me of white powder:—They make no noiſe, but are full of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>

                  <speaker>LUCINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay; but that tender melancholy will ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your mind to receive the kindred paſſion of love, that I ſhould not wonder if—in ſhort, grief is very amorous, my dear.</p>

                  <p>There again now!—Another of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade habits our paſſions wear:—When you are in love with a man's perſon, you fancy it is a refin'd eſteem for his merit.—Oh, Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia! under that illuſion the heart of a woman will ſoften and melt prodigiouſly.—Do you think it poſſible to have a laſting eſteem for a man, merely on the ſcore of his merit?</p>

                  <speaker>LUCINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, to ſpeak a plain truth, which I would not have a man hear from me for the world, whims, paſſions, and deſires, are the ground-works of our minds; and virtue, I am afraid, is but in-laid.</p>

                  <speaker>LUCINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, if there is any lady really ſmitten, the diſpute between her love and her delicacy will not laſt long.—Delicacy may talk of nice points of honour; but that will only reach the head: While every ſyllable from that little urchin Love will make its way directly to the heart; and while Delicacy is reading lectures, Love will perſuade, and ſo the buſineſs is over.—

                  <p>Why, I don't know—one is always ſaying one ſilly thing or another.—Let's change the ſubject; the man is not worth a moment's thought: his indiſcretion is the ſmalleſt of his faults.—My reſt ſhan't ſuffer a ſingle wink for him.</p>
