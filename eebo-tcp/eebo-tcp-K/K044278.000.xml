            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following performance cannot commit it to the preſs, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the deepeſt ſenſe of gratitude, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common marks of approbation with which he has been honoured by the Public.</p>
            <p>Tho' he has choſen a title us'd by MOLIERE, he has neither borrowed a ſingle circumſtance from that great poet, nor to the beſt of his recollection from any other writer.—His chief ſtudy has been to ſteer between the extremes of ſentimental gloom, and the exceſſes of unintereſting levity; he has ſome laugh, yet he hopes he has alſo ſome leſſon; and faſhionable as it has been lately for the wits,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0055100300:3"/>
even with his friend Mr. Garrick at their head, to ridicule the Comic Muſe, when a little grave, he muſt think that ſhe degenerates into farce, where the grand buſineſs of inſtruction is neglected, and conſider it as a hereſy in criticiſm, to ſay that one of the moſt arduous taſks within the reach of literature, ſhou'd, when executed; be wholly without utility.</p>
            <p>The Author having been preſumptuous enough to aſſert, that he has not purloin'd a ſingle ſprig of bays from the brow of any other writer, he may, perhaps, be aſk'd, if there are not ſeveral plays in the Engliſh language, which, before his, produced Generals, Lawyers, Iriſhmen, Duels, Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, and Miſtakes? He anſwers, yes; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes moreover, that all the Comedies before his, were compos'd not only of men and women, but that before his, the great buſineſs of comedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in making difficulties for the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them; in diſtreſſing poor young lovers; and in rendering a happy marriage the object of every cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>Yet tho' the Author of the School for Wives, pleads guilty to all theſe charges, ſtill, in extenuation of his offence, he begs leave to obſerve, that having
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0055100300:4"/>
only men and women to introduce upon the ſtage, he was oblig'd to compoſe his Dramatis Perſonae of mere fleſh and blood; if, however, he has thrown this fleſh and this blood, into <hi>new</hi> ſituations; if he has given a <hi>new</hi> fable, and plac'd his characters in a point of light hitherto unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited:—he flat.ters himſelf that he may call his play, a <hi>new</hi> play, and tho' it did not exiſt before the creation of the world, like the famous Welch pedigree, that he may have ſome ſmall pretenſions to originality.</p>
            <p>Two things beſides the general moral incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated thro' his piece, the Author has attempted; the firſt, to reſcue the law, as a profeſſion, from ridicule or obliquy; and the ſecond, to remove the imputation of a barbarous ferocity, which dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic writers, even meaning to compliment the Iriſh nation, have connected with their Idea of that gallant people:—The law, like every other profeſſion, may have members who occaſionally diſgrace it; but to the glory of the Britiſh name, it is well know that in the worſt of times, it has produced numbers whoſe virtues reflected honour upon human nature; many of the nobleſt privileges the conſtitution has to boaſt of, were derived from the integrity, or the wiſdom of lawyers:
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0055100300:5"/>
Yet the ſtage has hitherto caſt an indiſcriminate ſtigma upon the whole body, and laboured to make that profeſſion either odious or contemptible in the theatre, which, if the laws are indeed dear to good Engliſhmen, can never be too much reſpected in this kingdom. There is ſcarcely a play in which a lawyer is introduced, that is not a libel upon the long robe; and ſo ignorant have many dramatic writers been, that they have made no diſtinction whatever, between the characters of the firſt Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Weſtminſter-Hall, and the meaneſt ſolicitors at the Old Bailey.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the gentlemen of Ireland, where even an abſolue attempt is manifeſted, to place them in a favourable point of view, they are drawn with a brutal promptitude to quarrel, which is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the well known humanity of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—The gentlemen of Ireland have doubtleſs a quick ſenſe of honour, and, like the gentlemen of England, as well as like the gentlemen of every other high-ſpirited nation, are perhaps unhappily too rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to draw the ſword, where they conceive themſelves injured—But to make them proud of a barbarous propenſity to Duelling; to make them actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the effuſion of blood, is to faſten a very unjuſt reproach upon their general character, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0055100300:6"/>
them univerſally obnoxious to ſociety. The author of the School for Wives therefore, has given a different picture of Iriſh manners, though in humble life, and flatters himſelf that thoſe who are really acquainted with the original, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege it to be at leaſt a tolerable reſemblance.</p>
            <p>It would be ungrateful in the higheſt degree to cloſe this preface, without acknowleging the very great obligations which the author has to Mr. Garrick. Every attention, which either as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager, or as a man, he could give to the intereſt of the following play, he has beſtowed with the moſt generous alacrity; but univerſally admired as he is at preſent, his intrinſic value will not be known, till his loſs is deplored; and the public have great reaſon to wiſh, that this may be a very diſtant event in the annals of the theatre. The Epilogue ſufficiently marks the maſterly hand from which it originated; ſo does the comic commencement of the Prologue, and the elegant writer of the graver part, is a character of diſtinguiſhed eminence in the literary republic.</p>
            <p>It has been remarked with great juſtice, that few new pieces were ever better performed than <hi>The School for Wives.</hi> Mr. King, that highly-deſerving
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0055100300:7"/>
favourite of the town, was every thing the author could poſſibly wiſh in General Savage. Mr. Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh acquired a very conſiderable ſhare of merited reputation in Belville. Mr. Moody is unequalled in his Iriſhmen. Mr. Palmer, from his manner of ſupporting Leeſon, was entitled to a much better part: And Mr. Weſton in Torington was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Miſs Younge, in Mrs. Belville, extorted applauſe from the coldeſt auditor. Her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs—her force—her pathos, were the true effuſions of genius, and proved that ſhe has no ſuperior where the feelings are to be intereſted. With reſpect to Mrs. Abington, enough can never be ſaid. The elegance, the vivacity, the critical nicety with which ſhe went through Miſs Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham, is only to be gueſſed at, by thoſe who are familiar with the performance of that exquiſite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Her Epilogue was delivered with an anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be conceived, and manifeſted the ſtrict propriety, with which ſhe is called the firſt prieſteſs of the Comic Muſe in this country.</p>

                  <speaker>CAPT.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I took care of that; for tho' ſhe is'n't married to my father, ſhe has ten times the influence of a wife, and might injure me not a little with him, if I didn't ſupport her ſide of the queſtion.</p>

                  <p>It was a pleaſant conceit of Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, to inſinuate the poor woman was diſordered in her ſenſes!—</p>

                  <speaker>CAPT.</speaker>
                  <p>And did you obſerve how the termagant's violence of temper, ſupported the probability of the charge?</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Miſs</hi> WAL.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, ſhe became almoſt frantic in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, when ſhe found herſelf treated like a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.</p>

                  <speaker>CAPT.</speaker>
                  <p>Belville's affected ſurpriſe too, was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable!</p>

                  <p>Yes, the hypocritical compoſure of his countenance, and his counterfeit pity for the poor woman, were intolerable!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CAPT.</speaker>
                  <p>While that amiable creature, his wife, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly believed every ſyllable he ſaid—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                     <hi>Miſs</hi> WAL.</speaker>
                  <p>And felt nothing but pity for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, inſtead of paying the leaſt regard to the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But pray, is it really under a pretence of getting the girl upon the ſtage, that Belville has taken away Mrs. Tempeſt's neice from the people ſhe boarded with?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CAPT.</speaker>
                  <p>It is: Belville, ever on the look out for freſh objects, met her in thoſe primitive regions of purity, the Green-Boxes; where, diſcovering that ſhe was paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately deſirous of becoming an actreſs, he improved his acquaintance with her, in the fictitious character of an Iriſh manager, and ſhe eloped laſt night, to be, as ſhe imagines, the heroine of a Dublin theatre.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Miſs</hi> WAL.</speaker>
                  <p>So, then, as he has kept his real name artfully conceal'd, Mrs. Tempeſt can at moſt but ſuſpect him of Miſs Leeſon's ſeduction.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CAPT.</speaker>
                  <p>Of no more; and this, only, from the deſcription of the people who ſaw him in company with her at the play; but, I wiſh the affair may not have a ſerious concluſion; for ſhe has a brother, a very ſpirited young fellow, who is a council in the Temple, and who will certainly call Belville to an account, the moment he hears of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Miſs</hi> WAL.</speaker>
                  <p>And what will become of the poor creature after he has deſerted her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CAPT.</speaker>
                  <p>You know that Belville is generous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and has a thouſand good qualities to counter-balance this ſingle fault of gallantry, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminates his character.</p>

                  <p>Nay, no more of this, my love; no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live happier than Belville and his wife; nor is there a man in England, notwithſtanding all his levity, who conſiders his wife with a warmer degree of affection: if you have a friendſhip therefore, for her, let her continue in an error, ſo neceſſary to her repoſe, and give no hint, whatever, of his gallantries to any body.</p>

                  <p>You are all goodneſs; and the prudence with which you have conceal'd our private engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has eternally oblig'd me; had you truſted the ſecret even to Mrs. Belville, it wou'dn't have been ſafe; ſhe wou'd have told her huſband, and he is ſuch a rattleſkul, that, notwithſtanding all his regard for me, he wou'd have mention'd it in ſome moment of levity, and ſent it in a courſe of circulation to my father.</p>

                  <p>Bewitching ſoftneſs!—But your goodneſs, I flatter myſelf, will be ſpeedily rewarded; you are now ſuch a favourite with him, that he is eternally talking of you; and I really fancy he means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you to me himſelf: for, laſt night, in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after he had declared you would make the beſt wife in the world, he ſeriouſly aſk'd me if I had any averſion to matrimony?</p>

                  <p>So it was, I aſſure you; for, in the army, being uſed to nothing but command and obedience, he removes the diſcipline of the parade into his family, and no more expects his orders ſhou'd be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, in matters of a domeſtic nature, than if they were deliver'd at the head of his regiment.</p>

                  <p>Only that Miſs Walſingham is left alone, and that I have now an opportunity of entertaining her; you muſt excuſe me, Savage; you muſt upon my ſoul; but not a word of this affair to any body; becauſe when I ſhake her off my hands, there may be fools enough to think of her, upon terms of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable matrimony.

                  <p>So, here's a diſcovery! a precious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very! and while I have been racking my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſacrificing my intereſt, to promote the happineſs of this woman, ſhe has been liſtening to the addreſſes of another; to the addreſſes of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man! the huſband of her friend, and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate friend of her intended huſband!—By Belville's own account, however, ſhe has not yet proceeded to any criminal lengths—But why did ſhe keep the affair a ſecret from me? or why did ſhe continue in his houſe after a repeated declaration of his unwarrantable attachment?—What's to be done?—If I open my engagement with her to Belville, I am ſure he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſiſt;—but then her honour is left in a ſtate extremely queſtionable—It ſhall be ſtill concealed— While it remains unknown, Belville will himſelf tell me every thing;—and doubt, upon an occaſion of this nature, is infinitely more inſupportable than the downright falſehood of the woman whom we love.</p>

                  <p>ZOUNDS! Torrington, give me quarter, when I ſurrender up my ſword: I own that for theſe twenty years, I have been ſuffering all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of marriage, without taſting any one of its comforts, and rejoicing in an imaginary freedom, while I was really grovelling in chains.</p>

                  <p>'Tis too true. But, you know, ſhe ſacrificed much for me;—you know that ſhe was the widow of a colonel, and refus'd two very advantageous matches on my account.—</p>

                  <p>If our affections, Madam, were under the government of our reaſon, circumſtanced as I am, this unhappy boſom wouldn't be torn by paſſion for Miſs Walſingham.—Had I been bleſs'd with your acquaintance, before I ſaw Mrs. Belville, my hand as well as my heart, wou'd have been humbly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to your acceptance—fate, however, has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it otherwiſe, and it is cruel to reproach me with that ſituation as a crime, which ought to be pitied as my greateſt misfortune.</p>

<stage>(aſide.)</stage>
Why, to be ſure in theſe days, Mr. Belville, the inſtances of conjugal infidelity are ſo very ſcarce, and men of faſhion are ſo remarkable for a tender attachment to their wives, that I don't wonder at your circumſpection—But do
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0055100300:37"/>
you think I can ſtoop to accept you by halves, or admit of any partnerſhip in your heart?</p>

                  <p>O you muſt do more than that, if you have any thing to ſay to me.
<stage>(aſide.)</stage>
Surely, Madam, when you know my whole ſoul unalterably your own, you will permit me to preſerve thoſe appearances with the world, which are indiſpenſibly requiſite—Mrs. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville is a moſt excellent woman, however it may be my fortune to be devoted to another—Her happineſs, beſides, conſtitutes a principal part of my felicity, and if I was publicly to forſake her, I ſhould be hunted as a monſter from ſociety.</p>

                  <p>Then, I ſuppoſe, it is by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Mrs. Belville's repoſe, Sir, that you make love to other women; and by way of ſhewing the nicety of your honour, that you attempt the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſuch as your own roof, peculiarly, intitles to protection. For the honour intended to me—thus low to the ground, I thank you, Mr. Belville.</p>

                  <p>Good bye.—Don't let this accident mortify your vanity too much;—but take care, the next time you vow everlaſting love, that the object is neither tender enough to ſob—ſob—at your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; nor provoking enough to make a propoſal of leaving England.—How greatly a little common ſenſe can lower theſe fellows of extraordinary impudence?</p>

So then, I am fairly taken in, and ſhe has been only diverting herſelf with me all this time:— however, lady fair, I may chance to have the laugh in a little time on my ſide; for if you can ſport in this manner about the flame, I think it muſt in the run lay hold of your wings:—what ſhall I do in this affair?—ſhe ſees the matter in its true light, and there's no good to be expected from thumping of boſoms, or ſqueezing white handkerchiefs;—no theſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0055100300:38"/>

                  <p>O, Connolly, a man of ſpirit ſhould learn prudence from his very pride, and conſider every unneceſſary debt he contracts as a wanton diminution of his character! the moment he makes another his creditor—he makes himſelf a ſlave! He runs the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of inſults, which he never can reſent, and of diſgraces which are ſeldom to be mitigated! He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs the danger of being dragg'd, like the vileſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon to the felon's priſon! and, ſuch is the depravity of the world, that guilt is even more likely to meet with advocates, than misfortune!

Poor lad! I don't wonder that he is ſo much afraid of a priſon, for to be ſure it is a bleſſed place to live in; and a bleſſed law it muſt be, which coops a man up from every chance of getting money, by way of making him pay his debts—But now let my thick ſkull conſider, if there is any method of preventing this infernal duel. Suppoſe I have him

bound over to the pace! No, that will never do—it would be a ſhameful thing for a gintleman to keep the pace! Beſides, I muſt appear in the buſineſs, and people may think, from my connexion with him, that he has not honour enough to throw away his life: Suppoſe I go another way to work, and ſend an anonymous letter about the affair to Mrs. Belville: They ſay, though ſhe is a woman of faſhion, that no creter upon earth can be fonder of her huſband. Surely the good genius of Ireland put this ſcheme into my head—I'll about it this minute; and if there's only one of them kept from the field, I don't think that the other can be much hurt, when there will be no body to fight with him.

Now, Mr. Belville, let me have a few words with you; Miſs Walſingham, the ripe, the luxurious Miſs Walſingham, expects to find you there burning with impatience:—But, my dear friend, after the occurrences of the day, can you be weak enough to plunge into freſh crimes? Can you be baſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0055100300:86"/>
enough to abuſe the goodneſs of that angel your wife; and wicked enough, not only to deſtroy the innocence which is ſhelter'd beneath your own roof, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your family perhaps again, to the danger of loſing a ſon, a brother, a father, and a huſband? The poſſeſſion of the three Graces is ſurely too poor a recompence for the folly you muſt commit, for the ſhame you muſt feel, and the conſequences you muſt hazard. Upon my ſoul if I ſtruggle a little longer, I ſhall riſe in my own opinion, and be leſs a raſcal than I think myſelf:—Ay, but the object is bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;—the matter will be an eternal ſecret—and if it is known that I ſneak in this pitiful manner from a fine woman, when the whole elyſium of her perſon ſolicits me:—well, and am I afraid the world ſhould know that I have ſhrunk from an infamous action?—A thouſand bleſſings on you dear conſcience for that one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;—I ſhall be an honeſt man after all—Suppoſe, however, that I give her the meeting; that's danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;—that's dangerous:—and I am ſo little accuſtomed to do what is right, that I ſhall certainly do what is wrong, the moment I am in the way of temptation. Come, Belville, your reſolution is not ſo very ſlender a dependance, and you owe Miſs Walſingham re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the injury which you have done her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. I'll give her the meeting—I'll take her to the houſe I intended—I'll—Zounds! what a fool I have been all this time, to look for precarious ſatisfaction in vice, when there is ſuch exquiſite pleaſure to be found at a certainty in virtue!
