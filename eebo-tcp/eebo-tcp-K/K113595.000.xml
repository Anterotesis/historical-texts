            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO Lord <hi>CLARE.</hi>
            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>THANKS, my Lord, for your Ven'ſon; for finer, or fatter,</l>
               <l>Never rang'd in a foreſt, or ſmok'd on a platter:</l>
               <l>The Haunch was a picture for Painters to ſtudy;</l>
               <l>The white was ſo white, and the red was ſo ruddy!</l>
               <l>I had thoughts, in my chamber to hang it in view,</l>
               <l>To be ſhown to my Friends as a piece of <hi>Virtù;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>As in ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Houſes, where things are ſo-ſo,</l>
               <l>One Gammon of Bacon hangs up for a ſhow;</l>
               <l>But, for eating a raſher of what they take pride in,</l>
               <l>They'd as ſoon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in.</l>
               <l>But hold—let us pauſe—Don't I hear you pronounce</l>
               <l>This tale of the Bacon a damnable bounce?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0657000400:6"/>
Well, ſuppoſe it a bounce; ſure a Poet may try,</l>
               <l>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly:</l>
               <l>But, my Lord, it's no bounce: I proteſt, in my turn,</l>
               <l>It's a truth; and your Lordſhip may aſk Mr. BURNE.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To go on with my tale—As I gaz'd on the Haunch,</l>
               <l>thought of a Friend that was truſty and ſtaunch:</l>
               <l>So I cut it, and ſent it to REYNOLDS undreſt,</l>
               <l>To paint it, or eat it, juſt as he lik'd beſt.</l>
               <l>Of the Neck and the Breaſt I had next to diſpoſe;</l>
               <l>'Twas a neck and a breaſt—that might rival MONROE's:</l>
               <l>But in parting with theſe I was puzzled again,</l>
               <l>With the <hi>how,</hi> and the <hi>who,</hi> and the <hi>where,</hi> and the <hi>when:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>There's COLEY, and WILLIAMS, and HOWARD, and HIFF—</l>
               <l>I think they love Ven'ſon; I know they love Beef:</l>
               <l>But—hang it!—to Poets, that ſeldom can eat,</l>
               <l>Your very good Mutton's a very good treat:</l>
               <l>Such dainties to them! It <hi>would</hi> look like a flirt,</l>
               <l>Like ſending 'em Ruffles when wanting a Shirt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While thus I debated, in <hi>reverie</hi> center'd,</l>
               <l>An Acquaintance, a Friend—as he call'd himſelf, enter'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0657000400:7"/>
A fine-ſpoken Cuſtom-houſe Officer he,</l>
               <l>Who ſmil'd as he gaz'd on the Ven'ſon and me.</l>
               <l>" What have we got here?—Aye, this is <hi>good eating!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" Your own, I ſuppoſe—or is it in waiting?"</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Why, whoſe ſhould it be, Sir?</hi> cry'd I, with a flounce;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I get theſe things often—</hi>But that was a bounce.</l>
               <l>" If that be the caſe then," cry'd he very gay,</l>
               <l>" I'm glad I have taken this houſe in my way.</l>
               <l>" To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me:</l>
               <l>" No words—I inſiſt on't—preciſely at three.</l>
               <l>" And now that I think on't, as I am a ſinner,</l>
               <l>" We wanted this Ven'ſon to make up the dinner.</l>
               <l>" I'll take no denial—you ſhall, and you muſt;</l>
               <l>" And my Wife, little <hi>Kitty,</hi> is famous for Cruſt.</l>
               <l>" We'll have JOHNSON and BURKE; all the Wits will be there;</l>
               <l>" My acquaintance is ſlight, or I'd aſk my Lord CLARE.</l>
               <l>" Here, Porter! this Ven'ſon with me to <hi>Mile-end—</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" No words, my dear GOLDSMITH! my very good Friend!"</l>
               <l>Thus, ſeizing his hat, he bruſh'd off like the wind,</l>
               <l>And the Porter and Eatables follow'd behind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0657000400:8"/>
               <l>Left alone to reflect, having empty'd my ſhelf,</l>
               <l>And nobody with me at ſea, but myſelf;</l>
               <l>Though I could not help thinking my Gentleman haſty,</l>
               <l>Yet JOHNSON and BURKE, and a good Ven'ſon Paſty,</l>
               <l>Were things that I never diſlik'd in my life,</l>
               <l>Though clogg'd with a Coxcomb, and <hi>Kitty</hi> his Wife.</l>
               <l>So next day, in due ſplendor to make my approach,</l>
               <l>I drove to his door in my own Hackney-coach.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</l>
               <l>(A chair-lumber'd Cloſet, juſt twelve feet by nine)</l>
               <l>My Friend bid me welcome, but ſtruck me quite dumb</l>
               <l>With tidings <hi>that</hi> JOHNSON and BURKE could not come:</l>
               <l>" And I knew it," he cry'd; "both eternally fail;</l>
               <l>" The one at the Houſe, and the other with THRALE.</l>
               <l>" But, I warrant for me, we ſhall make up the Party,</l>
               <l>" With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</l>
               <l>" The one is a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> the other a <hi>Jew,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" Who dabble and write in the Papers—like you:</l>
               <l>" The one writes the <hi>Snarler;</hi> the other, the <hi>Scourge:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" Some think he writes <hi>Cinna—</hi>he owns to <hi>Panurge.</hi>"</l>

            <lg>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0657000400:9"/>
               <l>While thus he deſcrib'd them by Trade and by Name,</l>
               <l>They enter'd; and Dinner was ſerv'd as they came:</l>
               <l>At the top a fry'd Liver and Bacon was ſeen;</l>
               <l>At the bottom was Tripe in a ſwinging terrene;</l>
               <l>At the ſides there was Spinage and Pudding made hot;</l>
               <l>In the middle—a place, where the Ven'ſon was not.</l>
               <l>Now, my Lord, as for Tripe, it's my utter averſion;</l>
               <l>And your Bacon I hate, like a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Perſian:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But what vex'd me moſt was that damn'd <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Rogue,</l>
               <l>With his long-winded ſpeeches, and ſmiles, and his brogue:</l>
               <l>" And, Madam," ſays he, "may this bit be my poiſon</l>
               <l>" If a prettier Dinner I ever ſet eyes on!</l>
               <l>" Pray, a ſlice of your Liver;—but may I be curſt,</l>
               <l>" But I've eat of your Tripe till I'm ready to burſt."</l>
               <l>'Your Tripe!' quoth the <hi>Jew,</hi> 'if the truth I may ſpeak,</l>
               <l>'I could eat of this Tripe ſeven days in the week:</l>
               <l>'I like theſe <hi>here</hi> Dinners, ſo pretty and ſmall;</l>
               <l>'But your Friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.'</l>
               <l>

" O ho!" quoth my Friend, "he'll come on in a trice;</l>
               <l>" He's keeping a corner for ſomething that's nice:</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0657000400:11"/>
You've got an odd ſomething, a kind of diſcerning,</l>
               <l>A reliſh, a taſte, ſicken'd over by learning;</l>
               <l>At leaſt it's your temper, 'tis very well known,</l>
               <l>That you think very ſlightly of all that's your own:</l>
               <l>So perhaps, in your habits of thinking amiſs,</l>
               <l>You may make a Miſtake—and think ſlightly of This.</l>

            <l>May ſpeak our gratitude, but not his fame.</l>
            <l>What heart but feels his ſweetly-moral lay,</l>

            <l>Celeſtial themes confeſs'd his tuneful aid;</l>

            <l>Needleſs to him the tribute we beſtow,</l>
            <l>The tranſitory breath of Fame below:</l>
