            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THoſe who are acquainted with Mr. <hi>Aſhmole</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the moſt Noble Order of the Garter,</hi> will eaſily ſatisfy themſelves; that no Pains or Induſtry was wanting to Perfect and Complete ſo Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous a Work: He had the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a very gracious Prince, and the uſe of publick Records, more particularly the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books of the <hi>Order,</hi> with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſeveral MSS wrote by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Arms, who bore Part in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or went on Embaſſies to Stranger Kings, Princes, &amp;c. and by their conſtant Obſervations, were familiarly verſed in all its Laws and Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>Theſe were very great helps to him, and it muſt be confeſſed his own elaborate Study had not leſs owing to it. There is nothing that has relation to this <hi>moſt Noble Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which he has not touched on; and indeed
<pb facs="tcp:0739200500:8"/>
it is a Work ſo very copious, that he does himſelf acknowledge he has inſerted ſome things of little importance; which he deſires may be conſidered to be done, to gratify ſome few, who have a more immediate concern therein.</p>
            <p>The Reader will in this Treatiſe find little elſe omitted: A very painful and exact A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment has been made, many Corrections of the Author's, which he ſaw before his Death, and left among his other Books in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary at <hi>Oxford,</hi> are here carefully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; ſome Additions are made, a Liſt continued, of the ſeveral <hi>Knights-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi> as well as Officers of the <hi>Order,</hi> for above forty Years; and the Coats of Arms of abundance of the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> viſibly corrected from good Authorities; and every diſtinct Chapter treated of at large; ſo that this Work has not been compleated but at great Labour as well as Expence, which could not have been ſupported, but for the Encouragement ſome of the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> of the <hi>moſt Noble Order</hi> were pleaſed to give it; as well in their Subſcriptions, as in the good Opinion they ſeemed to Expreſs of the Deſign.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was, undoubtedly, a good Sentiment in the firſt Collector of this Learned Work, to introduce, as well as a Diſcourſe of <hi>Knighthood</hi> in general, a Treatiſe of all the ſeveral <hi>Orders</hi> that have prevail'd in other Parts of the World; for theſe in their Riſe and Inſtitutions, having a relative Senſe to the particular Subject he was to illuſtrate, ſeemed to afford him a very good Opportunity of doing it, by building on ſo convenient a Foundation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore, (tho' much more confin'd to bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity) follow the ſame Method, making it ſerve as a proper Introduction; there being many Things in the voluminous Original, which I conceive may with leſs Inconveniency be diſpenc'd with.</p>
               <p>IT was a conſtant Maxim in all well-regulated Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, to give a juſt Encouragement to Merit, and this by proportioning Rewards to the Service done; for Merit muſt be ſuppos'd to conſiſt in the Performance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0739200500:10"/>
of ſome Vertuous or Heroick Action, directed for the publick Good: And as Vertue is either Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or Civil, ſo the Diſtribution of Rewards is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; either by beſtowing Degrees and Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or by Donations of Wealth; ſo that in either Conſtruction, Vertue may have its proper and ſuitable Reward.</p>
               <p>BUT the proper Reward of Military <hi>Vertue,</hi> is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: (to which diſtinct Head this Work is confin'd.) Honour, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the <hi>Greateſt of exteriour Goods:</hi> And being an Object of a nobler Ambition than the Accumulation of Wealth, is principally the Aim of that <hi>Vertue</hi> we underſtand by <hi>Valour;</hi> which ſprings from more generous Spirits, and hath been the conſtant Foundation of raiſing Men to the higheſt Eminence of Glory, and ſuperiour Dignity.</p>
               <p>BUT that Fame might not loſe it ſelf in an unbounded Notion, it was at length thought fit to reduce Honour into Form and Order, by inveſting the Perſon meriting with ſome particular Title or Appellation of Excellence, (the Original of all Nobility;) of which Knighthood, as it hath been accounted the moſt ſuitable Reward to the greateſt Vertue, ſo it hath been eſteemed the chief and primary Honour among many Nations.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> held Honour and Vertue in that Eſteem, that they deify'd, and dedicated Temples to them: They made them ſo contiguous in their Situation, that there was no other Paſſage to that of Honour, but thro' the Temple of Vertue, myſtically admoniſhing, that Honour was not to be attained by any other Way.</p>
               <p>IN ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Coins we ſee Honour and Vertue repreſented together in one Reverſe, and in one Medal; the Face of Honour ſo ſhadows that of Vertue, that but a little of it appears, <hi>Honour being the more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the two; and where we behold any Perſon outwardly adorned with it, we are to judge him inwardly endued with Vertue, inaſmuch as Honour is his due, and juſtly beſtowed upon him.</hi>

               <p>§. 4. OF the Degrees of Knighthood. We ſhall firſt of the <hi>Monozons, i. e.</hi> Knights begirt with the Military Girdle, a Cuſtom devolved to the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> from ancient Times, and from them to After-Ages.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> notes, <hi>That the late Emperors conferred the Dignity af Knighthood with the Military Girdle inſtead of all other Arms, becauſe that Part more eminent amongst them girdeth, ſupporteth, and adorneth the reſt;</hi> whence <hi>Selden</hi> calls this Girding the moſt eſſential part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Nor do we find among the various Ceremonies of <hi>Knighthood</hi> any that have continued ſo conſtant in Practice as the endowing with Girdle and Sword, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments proper to the Dignity and Marks of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> with which the Statues and Portraitures of <hi>Knights,</hi> on their Grave-ſtones have been adorned.</p>
               <p>FOR as at this Day <hi>Knights</hi> are ſtyled <hi>Equites Aurati,</hi> from the Golden Spurs, heretofore put on at their Creation, ſo were they more anciently <hi>Singulo Miletari donati,</hi> in reſpect, when any one was <hi>Knighted,</hi> he was not only ſmitten with the Sword, but inveſted with Sword and Belt, yet retain'd at the creating our Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> as the old Formulary thus hath it; Then ſhall the King of great Favour take the Sword, and gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as the Ceremony of a gentle Touch on the Shoulder with the flat Side of the Sword hath been ſince uſed, inſtead of girting with the Sword and Belt, (eſpecially in Times of War, or in Haſte) as an Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Military Order; ſo on the contrary, it is not unuſual now-adays, for the Prince, at leaſt <hi>Gladi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE third Sort were <hi>Knights Banerets,</hi> who ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Wars, that they were afterwards permitted to uſe <hi>Vexillum quadratum,</hi> a ſquare Banner, whence they were called <hi>Equites vexillarii,</hi> or <hi>Chevaliers a Buniere</hi> from the Dutch <hi>Banerheere,</hi> Lord or Maſter of the Banner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Camden</hi> conceives this Title firſt devis'd by K. <hi>Edward</hi> 3. in Recompence of Martial Proweſs; a Recital of which Dignity is mention'd in a Patenr 20 <hi>E.</hi> 3. to <hi>John Coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for his Service, in taking <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. But it was much more ancient with us, as well as in <hi>France;</hi> and they had particular Robes, and other Ornaments given them from the Crown, <hi>ad apparatum ſuum pro militia, tanquam pro Baneretto, a Rege ſuſcipienda,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz. ad unum Tunicam,</hi> &amp;c. after which is ſet down the particular Robes, and other Ornaments appointed for his Creation.</p>
               <p>To ſhew this Dignity yet more ancient, there is the Evidence of a Writ in K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d's Time, for furniſhing <hi>Thomas Bardolf</hi> with the Robes of a <hi>Baneret.</hi> It is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour eſteemed the laſt among the Greateſt, <hi>viz. Nobilitum Majorum,</hi> or the Firſt of the Second Rank; and is placed in the Middle between the <hi>Barons</hi> and the other <hi>Knights;</hi> in which reſpect the <hi>Baneret</hi> may be called <hi>Vexillarius minor,</hi> as if he were the leſſer <hi>Banner-Bearer;</hi> to the End he might be ſo differenced from the Greater, namely the <hi>Baron,</hi> to whom the Right of bearing a ſquare Banner doth belong.</p>
               <p>BUT there are ſome remarkable differences between theſe Knights and Knights-Batchelors; as in the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Circumſtances of their Creations, the <hi>Baneret</hi> being not Created, unleſs at a Time when the King's Standard is erected, and that he bears his own Banner in the Field; whilſt the <hi>Knight-Batchelor</hi> follows that which is anothers.</p>
               <p>THIS farther difference is obſerved between them, that the <hi>Knight-Baneret</hi> had ſo many Gentlemen his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at Command, as that he could raiſe a Banner, and make up a Company of Soldiers to be maintained at his Table, and with his own Pay: But the <hi>Knight-Batchelor</hi> had not ſufficient for this, and therefore marched under the Banner of another; and the Wages of the <hi>Baneret</hi> were double.</p>

                  </gap>XT to theſe, we are to mention Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> which is a Degree that hath the Inveſtiture and Title of Knight, with an additional Denomination, derived from Part of the Ceremony of his Creation. It is the general receiv'd Opinion, that our K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. firſt inſtituted theſe Knights, which is juſtify'd by Sir <hi>John Froiſard,</hi> who ſays he created 46 of them at his Coronation, chuſing them from ſuch, as were either his Favorites, or had pretenſions to it from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Merits, or Services.</p>
               <p>BUT if the Ceremonies and Circumſtances of their Creation be well conſider'd, it may be inferr'd, that he rather reſtor'd the ancient way of making Knights, than Inſtituted them; and conſequently that the Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> are really no other than <hi>Knights-Batchelors;</hi> that is, ſuch as are created with thoſe Ceremonies, wherewith <hi>Knights-Batchelors</hi> were formerly created by Eccleſiaſticks: But ſome of them having been laid aſide, were then brought again into Uſe, and made peculiar to this Degree, and ſince continued to them upon ſome ſolemn and great Occaſion.</p>
               <p>AT the firſt View they look like a diſtinct Order of Knighthood; but cannot be ſo accounted, becauſe they have no Statutes aſſigned them, nor are in Caſe of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, ſupply'd, (the Eſſentials of diſtinct Orders) nor do they wear their Robes beyond the Time of that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion upon which they were created; as chiefly, the Coronation of a King or Queen, the Creation of a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the like; whereas alſo their Number is uncertain, and always at the Pleaſure of the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Favine</hi> calls them Knights of the Crown, becauſe, to diſtinguiſh them from Eſquires, they wore upon their Left Shoulder an Eſcutcheon of Black Silk embroider'd with three Crowns of Gold; but therein he miſtakes, for they never uſed only a Silk Lace, and the Jewel they wore was made of Gold, containing three Crowns, with this Motto <hi>Tria juncta in una,</hi> hanging down under the left Arm at a Carnation Ribbon worn croſs the Body.</p>
               <p>THIS leads us to the Degree of Baronets, who ſeem allied to Knighthood, by having granted them the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Sir</hi> to be ſet before their Names: But this gives them not the Dignity of Knighthood; nor can they properly be flyled Knights, until they be actually Knighted.</p>
               <p>

IT is a Degree erected <hi>Anno</hi> 9. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. and the Grant made by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It is Hereditary to them, and the Heirs Male of their Bodies lawfully begotten, for ever; and by a ſubſequent Decree of the ſaid King, Precedence is granted to them before all Banerets, except ſuch as ſhould be made by the King under his Standard, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in an Army Royal in open War, and the King perſonally preſent, and next to and immediately after the younger Sons of Viſcount and Barons.</p>
               <p>THE Ground for erecting this Degree was partly Martial; for tho' themſelves were not enjoined perſonal Service in the Wars, yet each Baronet was to maintain thirty Foot Soldiers for three Years in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after the rate of Eight Pence <hi>per</hi> Day, for the Defence of that Kingdom, and chiefly to ſecure the Plantation of <hi>Ulſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY were at leaſt to be deſcended from a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, on the Father's Side, that bore Arms, and had a Revenue of 1000 l. <hi>per Ann.</hi> or Lands of old Rents of equal Value with 1000 l. <hi>per Ann.</hi> of improv'd Lands, or at leaſt two Parts of three of ſuch Eſtate in Poſſeſſion; the other third in Reverſion Expectant upon one Life held only in Jointure.</p>
               <p>THE Year after, King <hi>James</hi> I. added ſome new Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Ornaments, <hi>viz.</hi> to Knight thoſe already made that were no Knights; and the Heirs hereafter of every Baronet ſhould, at the Age of One and Twenty Years, receive Knighthood; likewiſe that all Baronets might bear in Canton, or in an Ineſcutcheon, the Arms of <hi>Ulſter;</hi> and farther, to have place in the Armies of the King in the Groſs, near about the Royal Standard.</p>
               <p>SINCE the Inſtitution of Baronets in <hi>England,</hi> there have been made divers in <hi>Ireland</hi> after the like Form: And the Knights of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> were ordained in Imitation of Baronets in <hi>England</hi> by the ſaid King <hi>James, A. D.</hi> 1622. for the Planting that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by <hi>Scotch</hi> Colonies, and the Degree made likewiſe Hereditary.</p>
               <p>THESE latter wear an Orange Tawny Ribbon as their Badge, to diſtinguiſh them from other Knights; and it appears, there was an Intention, 1627. to move his then Majeſty, that all Baronets and Knights Bachelors might wear Ribbons of ſeveral Colours, ſome Badge or Jewel, in ſuch Sort as did the Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> to diſtinguiſh the one from the other: But that Matter dropt.</p>

                  <hi>Miles,</hi> even in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, denoted ſometimes a Dignity.

THE Enſigns of the Equeſtrian Order among the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which they were made, was a Publick Horſe, or a Gold Ring; yet ſtill, to thoſe who had Equeſtrian Cenſe, the Horſe was the ancienter Badge of the two; but when thro' the Multitude of theſe Knights no Publick Horſes were aſſigned, but to ſuch who were ready to enter upon Military Service, and to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0739200500:19"/>
fight in the Legions, ſuch were called <hi>Legionary Knights,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the reſt, who had only receiv'd the Honour of a Gold-Ring; for they were not all employ'd in Wars.</p>
               <p>THE Cenſor (after the Inſtitution of that Offiee <hi>ab urbe condita,</hi> 310.) and afterwards the Emperor, were the Perſons who beſtowed this <hi>Equus Militaris,</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus,</hi> as it was called from the Annual Allowance, to keep him, which they gave unto thoſe of known Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and approv'd Life, compelling him to ſerve in the Wars, tho' againſt his Will; (but in the more ancient Method of Election, Conſtraint was not uſed.) And upon Negligence in the Care of theſe Horſes, or any Blemiſh, Reproach, or Infamy, or Loſs of Patrimony in the Knights, the Horſes were not only taken away, but the Knights wholly disfranchis'd. <hi>Roſinus</hi> laying down the Manner and Order uſed in ejecting ſuch Knights, adds, <hi>A Recital being made of all the Knights that were inrolled, thoſe whoſe Names he omitted, were thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be depriv'd of that Dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN they had ſerved in the Wars the Time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, it was the Cuſtom to lead their Horſes by the Bridle into the Forum, before the <hi>Duumvirs</hi> [Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,] and giving an Account under whom and what Generals or Captains they had ſerved; they were thereupon diſmiſſed from farther Service in the Wars: An Example whereof <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates to have been given by <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>BUT whereas among the <hi>Roman</hi> Inſcriptions we find <hi>Equo publico honoratus donatus, ornatus,</hi> and <hi>exornatus,</hi> ſuch is not to be conſtrued to be of Equeſtrian Dignity, but only to have received the <hi>praemia militaria,</hi> with which the Emperors uſed to recompenſe ſome particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, by the Honour of ſuch a Gift, according to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius. Equus Publicus,</hi> by a wondrous, nevertheleſs an accuſtom'd Speech, among the <hi>Romans,</hi> is the Knight, <hi>qui equo publico meret.</hi> And <hi>qui equo publico donatus,</hi> the other deſerving Perſon.</p>
               <p>AS to the Ring: In <hi>Geneſis</hi> we read of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s taking off his Ring, and putting it upon <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Hand. When they came in Faſhion with the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Senators at firſt wore Iron ones, which were accounted the Enſign of Military Vertue, received upon a Publick Account. Howbeit, in Proceſs of Time, when Gold Rings were drawn into Uſe, none but Senators and Knights had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0739200500:20"/>
them. The Difference among the Rings of the three Orders in the State were, as <hi>Licetus</hi> obſerves, Gold Rings ſet with precious Stones were given to the Senators on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Plain Rings without Stones to the Knights, and Iron Rings to the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> or Free-born-men; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Equeſtri dignitate donare,</hi> and <hi>annulo honorare,</hi> is a promiſcuous Phraſe in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> to give the Dignity of Knighthood; and at the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> by the two Meaſures or Buſhels of Gold Rings ſent to <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights there ſlain was computed.</p>

               <p>AMONG the <hi>Germans,</hi> the Shield and Lance were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the grand Badges of Military Honour, or Knighthood. This the <hi>Lombards,</hi> the <hi>Franks,</hi> and our Country-men, all deſcending out of <hi>Germany,</hi> uſed, and was to us (in the Opinion of Sir <hi>Hen.

Much like the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> was the Cuſtom of making Knights among the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> And <hi>Favine</hi> notes the Shield and Lance were the proper Arms appertaining to a <hi>French</hi> Knight, which Eſquires, <hi>Armigers,</hi> carried always after their Maſters, Shields and Scutes (as they are vulgarly called) <hi>i. e.</hi> Equeſtrian Targets, inclining to an Oval, not Shields or Bucklers of Foot Soldiers.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Enſign and Ornament of Knightly Honour is, the <hi>Cingulum militare.</hi> or <hi>Balteus,</hi> which, <hi>Varro</hi> ſays, is <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> ſignifying a military Girdle, which were garniſhed with great Buckles, Studs, and Rings of pure Gold, to ſhew their Dignity and Power in military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and with ſuch a Belt, ſet with Pearls and precious Stones, young <hi>Athelſtan</hi> was girded, when he receiv'd <hi>Knighthood</hi> from his Grandfather King <hi>Alfred.</hi> Our Knights were no leſs anciently known by theſe Belts, than by their gilt Swords, Spurs, &amp;c. Howbeit the Uſe now only appears in Knights of the <hi>Bath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Belt was alſo added a Sword, not of Ordinary Uſe; and therefore termed the Sword of a <hi>Knight,</hi> which was hallowed with great Ceremony.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER eminent Badge is the Golden Spurs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, at the Time of their Creation, Knights Spurs were wont to be adorned; and to theſe, a little after the Conqueſt, were added far more and greater Oruaments.

               <p>THE Oath or Vow the Knights profeſſed, was in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to relieve and protect Widows, the Fatherleſs, Oppreſſed and Miſerable, and to defend the Church of God; which to keep and perform was eſteem'd as meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, as to do all that a Monk, Frier, or Canon Regular ſhould.</p>
               <p>THERE is alſo mention (by Mr. <hi>Selden)</hi> of conſecrating the Sword, offering it at the Altar, and receiving it again from thence, as an implicit Kind of taking an Oath. But as in Peace and great Leiſure theſe tedious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were uſed, yet it was otherwiſe in Times of War, or on a Day of Battle, where Hurry and Throng of Affairs would not permit; and therefore, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the joining of Battle, as after Victory obtained, it was uſual for the Prince or General in the Field, on Sight of the Army, to give thoſe whom he thought fit to advance to that Honour (they humbly kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him) a Stroke with a naked Sword flatwiſe upon their Shoulders, or elſe to touch their Heads or Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders lightly, without any other Ceremony, except pronouncing <hi>Sis Eques in nomine Dei;</hi> to which he adds, <hi>Riſe, Sir—Knight,</hi> or in the <hi>French, Sus,</hi> or <hi>Sois, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, au nom de Dieu,</hi> which we commonly call Dubbing, the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word uſed for Creating [Conſecrating] a Knight, from <hi>doopen</hi> to dip, by Bathing.</p>

Secondly,</hi> To repreſs the Incurſions and Robberies of the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to vindicate the Oppreſſed, redeem the Enſlaved, and to entertain and relieve Pilgrims and Strangers, which were Part of the Duties the <hi>Knights Hoſpitallers</hi> and <hi>Templars,</hi> &amp;c. ſtood engag'd in. A <hi>third</hi> Reaſon was, To Fight in Defence of the Chriſtian Faith, againſt Pagans and Infidels; to enlarge the Chriſtian Territories, and promote the Service of the Catholick Church: And indeed their Zeal very much advanced Chriſtianity. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> When Sovereign Princes perceived themſelves embroiled in Wars or dangerous Factions, the erecting ſuch an Order or Society was, that they might by ſuch a Tye reſtore Peace, quiet all Jealouſies, unite Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſecure a laſting Friendſhip and powerful Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, both for their own and their Country's Safety.

DON <hi>Raymond,</hi> laſt Earl of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> having in the Year 1149. reduced the City of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> from the <hi>Moors,</hi> on the Thirty Firſt following they laid a freſh Siege to it, in hopes to recover it. The Inhabitants were at length reduced to great Streights; they deſired Relief of the Earl, but he not being in a Condition to anſwer their Requeſt, they had Thoughts of a Surrender; which the Women to prevent put on the Apparel of the Men, and by a reſolute Salley forced the <hi>Moors</hi> to raiſe the Siege. The Gallantry of the Action the Earl ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by granting them ſeveral Privileges, and to perpetuate the Memory inſtituted this Order, ſomewhat like a Military one, and none were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, only thoſe brave Women, and the Honour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to their Deſcendants, and aſſigned them for a Badge a Thing like a <hi>Fryer's Capouche,</hi> ſharp at the Top, after the Form of a Torch, of a Crimſon Colour, to be worn upon their Head-Cloaths; that at all publick Meetings the Women ſhould have Precedence of the Men, and ſhould be exempted from all Taxes, and that all the Apparels and Jewels left by their dead Husbands ſhould be theirs.</p>
               <p>A more general Ornament of Honour peculiar to the Fair Sex is the <hi>Cordon,</hi> which ſome will have to be an Order, or Equivalent thereunto.

                  <p>THE principal Duty of theſe Canons (and of all the other Miniſters of the College) is continually to attend upon the Service of God in the Chapel of St. <hi>George;</hi> and the Statutes run upon each Day's Omiſſion of a Canon Reſident, to be mulcted his <hi>quotidian</hi> Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 12 <hi>d.</hi> And tho' we find no Licenſe of Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence granted them by their Founder, yet there is mention of Canons Reſident and Non-Reſident, for whom great Defalcations are appointed to be made, to prevent ſuch Neglects, becauſe the reſidentiary Canons bear not only the Burden of that Duty belonging to the Chapel, but the Expence of Hoſpitality and other Works of Charity, occaſion'd from their reſiding at <hi>Windſor.</hi>

THEN, King <hi>Edward</hi> III. out of the great Regard he had to military Honour, and thoſe who had bravely behav'd themſelves in his Wars, yet after chanced to fall in decay, made a Proviſion for their Relief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Subſiſtence in old Age, by providing for them in this his Foundation, and making a Coalition in one joint Body with the Cuſtos and Canons; theſe he call'd <hi>Milites Pauperes,</hi> and we Poor or Alms-Knights. The ſtated Number at firſt were Twenty Four, equal to the Cuſtos and Canons at the firſt Erection. But ſhortly after, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his inſtituting the Order of the <hi>Garter,</hi> Two more were added (as there was to the firſt Canons) to make the compleat Number of the Knights-Companions of that Order, which were Twenty Six, as we find ſtated at the Ordination of the College by the Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> the Pope's Delegate.</p>
               <p>THE Intention of the Founder was for thoſe that were real Objects of Charity, as he deſcribes them, <hi>viz.</hi> poor Knights, infirm in Body, indigent and decay'd, or as the Statutes of the <hi>Garter</hi> qualifies them, ſuch as thro' adverſe Turns of Fortune were reduced to that Extremity that they had not wherewithal to ſuſtain themſelves, to live ſo genteelly as was ſuitable for a Military Condition, which for greater Caution was rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated in the Statutes of King <hi>Hen.</hi> V. King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. and in the Orders of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> for it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, in caſe any Eſtate of 20 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> devolved on them, ſuch Knights were to be diſcharged the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and they were to proceed to a new Election.</p>
               <p>AT the firſt each Knight-Companion of the Order preſented his Alms-Knight, but ever after their Election was to be at the Diſpoſal of the Sovereign. Their Habit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0739200500:104"/>
was a Red Mantle, with the Eſcutcheon of St. <hi>George,</hi> without any Garter to ſurround it. Their Exhibition, after their firſt Election was 12 <hi>d.</hi> a-piece every Day they were at Service in the Chapel, or reſident in the College, beſides 40 <hi>s. per Annum</hi> for other Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, it being the ſtated Allowance appointed to each of the Canons Reſidents.</p>
               <p>ABOUT the Beginning of King <hi>Hen.</hi> VI's Reign, their <hi>quotidian</hi> Diſtributions and Annual 40 <hi>s.</hi> had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid upon the Account of ſome Diſſentions riſen between them and the Dean and Canons; but upon Complaint of <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Viſitor of the College, 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and their Arrears of both diſcharged, without any Deduction, and likewiſe obtained this Clauſe, That if the Treaſurer of the College became negligent in future Payments, he ſhould loſe his own <hi>Quotidians,</hi> from the Time of his voluntary Omiſſion, and the ſame to be divided among the Alms-Knights. Their Duty was to pray for the Sovereign and the Knights Companions, to be every Day preſent at High Maſs, the Maſſes of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> at Veſpers and Compline, and in default to be mulcted their 12 <hi>d. toties quoties,</hi> which was to be converted to the Uſe of the other Alms-Knights, then reſiding in the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor;</hi> notwithſtanding which Decree, the Dean did afterwards break in upon them, and diſpoſed of theſe Forfeitures at his Pleaſure, till 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. <hi>Adam,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, then Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Viſitor of the College, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd it, and another Complaint of like Nature being made of the Deans diſpoſing of Donations and other Liberalities of the Knights Companions in wrong of the Alms-Knights, this Chancellor decreed an equal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution between the Alms-Knights and Canons, till the King and Council ſhould otherwiſe determine.</p>
               <p>Theſe and other Differences between the Dean and Canons and Alms Knights, grew up to that height, that they became irreconcileable, inſomuch as in the Act of Parliament, 22 <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. for incorporating of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos and Canons, by the Name of Dean and Canons, the Alms-Knights were not only omitted; but this Clauſe inſerted, <hi>That the Dean and Canons, and their Succeſſors,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0739200500:105"/>
                  <hi>ſhould for ever more be utterly quit and diſcharged from all manner of Exhibition or Charge of or for any of the ſaid Knights.</hi> And this under the Cover, That the King has greatly augmented the Number of the Miniſters of the Chapel, that the Revenue was inſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both them and the Alms-Knights; but in the Dean and Canons Anſwer to the Knights Petition to repeal this Act, the Cauſe is alledged, For that ſome of theſe Knights uſed their utmoſt Endeavours before this Act, to incorporate themſelves, and to be exempt from the Obedience and Rule of the Dean and Canons.</p>
               <p>AFTER this Act, which ſtruck off their Quotidian Portions and Fees aſſigned by King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how the Alms Knights ſubſiſted we find not; but ſo ſoon as King <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. came to the Crown, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the King and Parliament for Repeal of the Act, 22 <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. and alledged it was obtained without their Knowledge, or being called thereunto, which Plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not at all; but on the contrary, the Dean and Canons, ſome Years after, got an Exemplification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of under the great Seal, dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> VII.</p>
               <p>AND it is very evident from King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII's Letter to the College, that what they did in this Nature after this Act commenced, was merely upon Courteſie; for he returns them Thanks for a Penſion of Twenty Marks conferred upon <hi>Peter Narbone,</hi> whom he had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to an Alms-Knights Place, and Promiſes to burthen them no more with Requeſts of this ſort, but that he would ſettle Lands for their Maintenance. So great was their Caution, <hi>Narbone</hi> was by Covenants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented between him and the Dean and Canons, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his Penſion upon that King's ſettling Lands on the College, for the Proviſion of ſuch Knights. In the Interval between the Diſunion of the College and Alms-Knights, to their Eſtabliſhment by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> their Habit and Badge continued the ſame, and was ſo confirmed by <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII's Statutes.

               <p>WE come now to treat of the moſt Noble and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Order of the Garter;</hi> which, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either its Antiquity, or the Nobleneſs of the Perſonages, that have been enroll'd, it excels and outvies all other Inſtitutions of Honour in the whole World. It owes its Original, as is confeſſed on all Hands, to <hi>Edward</hi> III. King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> yet as to the Occaſion, there are ſeveral Opinions which we ſhall rectifie. The vulgar and more general is, that the Garter of <hi>Joan,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> dropping caſually off as ſhe danced in a ſolemn Ball, King <hi>Edward</hi> ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing took it up from the Ground, whereupon ſome of his Nobles ſmiling, as at an amorous Action, and he obſerving their ſportive Humour, turned it off with a Reply in <hi>French, Honi ſoit qui mal y penſe;</hi> but withal added, in diſdain of their Laughter, <hi>That ſhortly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y ſhould ſee that Garter advanced to ſo high an Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown as to account themſelves happy to wear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT upon Examination of this Tradition, let others judge what Credit it bears to eſtabliſh its Belief; for Sir <hi>John Froiſſart,</hi> the only Writer of the Age that treats
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0739200500:128"/>
of this Inſtitution, aſſigns no ſuch Original, nor for 200 Years after is there any thing to the Purpoſe in our other Hiſtorians, till <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> took occaſion to ſay ſomething of it; but had it been Fact, ſome <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian or other, would not have neglected to regiſter it at a convenient Time with a Scoff and Ridicule, ſince that Nation was ſo ready to deride King <hi>Henry</hi> V's Deſign of invading them with a Return of Tennis Balls.</p>
               <p>IN the Original Statutes of this Order, there is not the leaſt Conjecture to countenance the Conceit of ſuch a Feminine Inſtitution, no not ſo much as laying an Obligation on the Knights-Companions to defend the Quarrels of Ladies (as ſome Orders then in being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned;) nor doth the Author of that Tract entitled <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutio clariſſimi Ordinis Militaris a praenobili ſubligaculo nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupati,</hi> prefaced to the Black Book of the <hi>Garter,</hi> let fall the manifeſt Paſſage to ground it on.</p>
               <p>As to what <hi>Polydore</hi> ſays, he is not ſo confident to aſcertain the Perſon whoſe Garter it was; but cautiouſly declining that, ſays, it was either the Queen's, or the King's Miſtreſs's; and if it were the latter, yet doth he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her Name and Title, both which (on what Authority we find not) are ſupplied by modern Hiſtorians, who call her <hi>Joan</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the ſame elſewhere cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the Name of the <hi>Fair Maid</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> (whom <hi>Edward</hi> the Black Prince, afterward married) whereas no Hiſtorian ever gave the leaſt Inuendo that King <hi>Edward</hi> III. ever courted her as a Miſtreſs. <hi>Selden</hi> points at her when he calls the Lady, from whom the Garter ſlipp'd, Counteſs of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Salisbury:</hi> But about the Time when this Order was founded ſhe in truth was dignified with neither Honour; for altho' ſhe was Daughter to <hi>Tho.</hi> of <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and had been ſometime the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Wife of <hi>William Mountague,</hi> ſecond Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> yet then ſhe cou'd not properly be accounted Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> She was actually Wife to Sir <hi>Thomas Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (one of the Firſt Founders of the Order.) Nor was ſhe yet (tho' afterwards) Counteſs of <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0739200500:129"/>
THAT there was a Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi> with whom King <hi>Edward</hi> III. became greatly enamour'd, <hi>Froiſſart</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports after this manner, <hi>That this King having relieved a Caſtle of that Earl's in the North, wherein his Counteſs had been beſieged by the</hi> Scots <hi>(the Earl himſelf being at that time Priſoner in</hi> France;) <hi>upon ſight of her extraordinary Beauty he fell in love with her; but ſhe ſo virtuouſly demeaned her ſelf, during his Abode there, that he declined further Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> However, ſome time after, the King out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee her, proclaim'd ſolemn Juſts in <hi>London,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Counteſs and other Ladies being invited, came up. This Caſtle it ſeems was <hi>Wark</hi> upon <hi>Tweed</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> which King <hi>Edward</hi> had formerly beſtowed on her Husband, for his good Service paſt, when he firſt eſpouſed her, being then but a Knight.</p>
               <p>ALTHO' it ſhould be admitted that this Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was the King's Miſtreſs, yet muſt it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, That ſhe was Wife to <hi>William Mountague,</hi> Kt. created Earl of <hi>Salisbury, Anno</hi> 11 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. Mother to <hi>William</hi> the before-mention'd ſecond Earl, that her Chriſtian Name was <hi>Catherine,</hi> not <hi>Alice,</hi> as <hi>Froiſſart,</hi> not <hi>Joan,</hi> as others call her, Daughter to <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Granſton,</hi> and that ſhe expired 28 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. But that the whole may appear, what indeed it is, a meer Fable, we ſhall inſert the Judgment of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> who took great Pains in this Particular. <hi>This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I take to be a vain and idle Romance, derogatory both to the Founder and the Order firſt publiſhed by</hi> Pol. Virgil, <hi>a Stranger to the Affairs of</hi> England, <hi>and by him taken upon no better ground than</hi> Fama Vulgi, <hi>the Tradition of the common People, too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling a Foundation to ſo great a Building.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OF the ſame Contexture with the former is another Tradition in</hi> Andrew du Cheſne, That the Queen departing from the King to her own Apartments, and he following ſoon after, chanced to eſpy a Blue Garter lying on the Ground (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ſlipp'd from her Leg) whilſt ſome of his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants careleſly paſſed by it, as diſdaining to ſtoop at ſuch a Trifle; but he knowing the Owner, commanded it to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him; at the Receipt of which he ſaid, You make but ſmall account of this Garter; but within few Months, I'll cauſe the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>her,</hi> What Men would conjecture of her, upon her loſing her Garter in ſuch a manner?</p>
               <p>BOTH Relations are far diſtant from Fact; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it has thus far'd with other Orders of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Foundation, and an amorous, inſtead of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Account, has been falſly render'd of their Inſtitution; as for Inſtance, <hi>The Order of the</hi> Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciade, and that of <hi>The Golden Fleece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is a third Opinion grounded on a Relation made of King <hi>Rich.</hi> I. who, whilſt his Forces were employ'd againſt <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Acon,</hi> and extremely tir'd and harraſs'd with the Siege, he, by the Aſſiſtance and Mediation of St. <hi>George</hi> (as imagin'd) was inſpir'd with freſh Courage, and bethought himſelf of a new Device, which was to tie about the Legs of a Number of Knights, a Leathern Thong Garter, for ſuch had he then at hand, whereby they being emulated to future Glory, with Aſſurance of Reward if they prov'd victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, they might be excited to behave themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidly and well, much after the Examples of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> among whom were diſtributed various Crowns for ſeveral Cauſes, to adorn the Soldiers: But if King <hi>Richard</hi> I. did make uſe of this Device in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> as a Signal or Mark of Diſtinction of a Party, upon ſome warlike Exploit, yet that he took Occaſion to create a diſtinct Order of Knighthood thereupon, there is not ſufficient warrant to believe; (for it is only put down in the Preface of the <hi>Black Book,</hi> but not in any Part of the Annals of the Order; nor can it plead higher Antiquity than the Reign of King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. when written.) All the Advantage that can be made of it, is, to heighten the Reputation of that Saint among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by which Means the Garter came to be dedicated to him, and not that it contributed to its Inſtitution.</p>

               <p>§ 2. THE true Motive was therefore, neither the Ladies Garter, or King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Leathern Thong, that it owes it Original to: But King <hi>Edward,</hi> being a Perſon of conſummate Vertue, gave himſelf up to military Affairs; and being engag'd in War for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Right to <hi>France,</hi> made uſe of the beſt Martialiſts

of the Age, did thereupon firſt deſign (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by its ancient Fame) the Reſtoration of King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s <hi>Round Table,</hi> to invite hither the Gallant Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from abroad, and endear them to himſelf; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging no Place more requiſite than <hi>Windſor,</hi> upon <hi>New-Year's-Day, A. D.</hi> 1344. he iſſu'd out Letters of Protection for the ſafe going and return of Foreign Knights, to try their Valour at the Solemn Juſts to be held there on <hi>Monday</hi> after the Feaſt of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (which happen'd <hi>Jan.</hi> 19.) And theſe Letters of Safe-Conduct continu'd in force until the <hi>Octaves</hi> of the Purification of our bleſſed Virgin enſuing, being the 18th Year of his Reign. At the Time appointed, he provided a great Supper to begin the Solemnity, and then ordain'd this Feſtival to be annually at <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide;</hi> and immediately after theſe firſt Exerciſes were over, for a future and better Accommodation, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Workmen and Carriages for erecting a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Building in the Caſtle, and therein plac'd a Table of Two Hundred Foot Diameter, where the Knights ſhould have their Entertainment of Diet, at his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of 100 <hi>l. per</hi> Week; to which Building he gave the Name of <hi>The Round Table.</hi> And as at theſe great Conventions the Days were ſpent in all Kinds of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Feats of Arms, Juſts and Turnaments, ſo were a great Part of the Nights conſum'd in publick Balls and dancing with the Ladies that attended the Queen thither; and perhaps it was hence conjectur'd, that at ſome of theſe Balls the Queen's Garter, or the Garter of <hi>Catherine,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> might ſlip off, and the King's taking it up occaſion Smiles in the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders; and afterwards, when the King had modell'd his intended Order, a Garter offering it ſelf for its chief Enſign, might add to the Conjecture; but that it was the principal Cauſe, is a groundleſs Imagination. And tho' King <hi>Edward</hi> advanc'd the Honour of the Garter, as to denominate the Order, yet was it not to enhance Reputation to, or perpetuate an effeminate Occaſion, but to adorn Martial Proweſs, with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Rewards and Splendor; to increaſe Vertue and Valour in the Hearts of his Nobility, that ſo true Worth, after long and hazardous Exploits, ſhould not

               <p>IT is further obſervable, that the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip de Valoys,</hi> in Emulation of this Seminary at <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſet up a <hi>Round Table</hi> at his Court, and invited Knights and valiant Men of Arms out of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Almaine</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, left they ſhould repair to our King <hi>Edward</hi> III. which meeting with Succeſs, prov'd a Countermine to his main Deſign; who perceiving that his Hoſpitality towards ſtrange Knights, upon Account of reviving King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s <hi>Round Table</hi> was too general, nor did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ingratiate them to his Perſon, but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrain'd and at Liberty, did after their Departure take what Side they pleas'd in the enſuing Wars, he at length reſolv'd upon a Projection more particu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, in the binding of the Leg with this enobled Enſign, there was given this Caveat and Exhortation, that the Knights ſhould not puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly (by running away from Battle) betray the Valour and Renown which is ingrafted in Conſtancy and Magnanimity. Nay, ſo exactly did the Founder contrive the whole Habit into the Signification of the Garter, that he ordain'd his and the Knights-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions Robes and Ornaments to be all alike, both for Materials and Faſhion, intimating thereby, That they ought to conſerve brotherly Affection among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The great Collar of the Order was made of equal Weight, and like Number of Knots and Links, in Token of the like Bond of Faith, Peace and Amity inviolably to be obſerv'd and retain'd amongſt them: In fine, all Things were ſo deſign'd, that every one might plainly perceive how much theſe Things tended to the Maintenance of Amity and Concord.</p>
               <p>IN further reference to the eſtabliſhing this Order, the aforeſaid King calling together the Earls, Barons, and principal Knights of his Kingdom, <hi>Freely,</hi> ſays <hi>Froiſſart, and obligingly declar'd his Mind to them concerning this Affair:</hi> To which <hi>all of them being well inclin'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd the Motion with equal Joy and Applauſe, deeming it would prove a very great Advancement to Piety, Nobility and Vertue, and likewiſe an excellent Expedient for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not only his Subjects one with another, but all Foreigners conjunctively with them, in the Bonds of Amity and Peace.</hi> And 'tis very improbable the prudent Founder ſhould ſummon his Nobles to conſult about the Grandeur of an Order, that had taken its Riſe from ſo ſlight an Occaſion as the dropping of a Garter from a Lady's Leg. Now, to draw the Tye of Friendſhip more cloſe, the King cauſed thoſe who were (or ſhould be) of the Order, to be call'd <hi>Fellows, Aſſociates, Colleagues, Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> and the Order it ſelf a <hi>Society, Fellowſhip, College of Knights,</hi> and <hi>Knight-Companionſhip;</hi> and their Habits to be all alike, to repreſent how they

               <p>IN the laſt Place, if we look upon the Statutes of its Inſtitution, we ſhall find the Injunctions wholly Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and ſo are the Words of Admonition pronounc'd at the putting on the Enſigns of the Order: And the Ground of the Inſtitution (in the Preamble to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's <hi>Exemplar)</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>for the Honour of God and Exaltation of the Catholick Faith, joyn'd both with Piety and Charity, in eſtabliſhing a College of religious Men to pray for the Proſperity of the Sovereign of the Order and the Knights-Companions, and to perform other holy Duties;</hi> as alſo <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a Maintenance for a Company of Alms-Knights, who have not otherwiſe wherewith to ſupport themſelves;</hi> but not one Word relating to the Engagement on behalf of the feminine Sex.</p>
               <p>AND whereas King <hi>Edw.</hi> III. had laid Claim by his Title to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and in Right thereof aſſum'd its Arms, he from the Colour of them, 'tis ſaid, caus'd the Garter to be made Blue, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription Gold: And it may, without ſtraining, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from the Motto, <hi>Honi ſoit qui mal y penſe,</hi> that he retorted Shame and Defiance upon him that ſhould dare to think amiſs of ſo juſt an Enterprize, as he had undertaken for recovering of his lawful Right to that Crown; and that the Magnanimity and Bravery of thoſe Knights, whom he had elected into this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was ſuch as would impower and enable them to maintain the Quarrel againſt all who thought ill of it. Conſonant to this is the Conjecture of <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> that this Apophthegm was deſign'd to put the Knights-Companions

in mind, <hi>Not to admit any Thing in their Actions, or among their Thoughts, derogatory to themſelves and their Honour.</hi>

               <p>THAT Age did exceedingly abound with Impreſſes, Motto's and Devices, and particularly King <hi>Edw.</hi> III. was ſo exceſſively given up to them, that his Apparel, Plate, Bed, Houſhold-Furniture, Shields, and even the Harneſs of his Horſes, and the like, were not without them, many of which now to deſcant upon would be a fruitleſs Attempt, ſeeing the Occaſion of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Circumſtances are loſt, that ſhould illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them; and others, by reaſon of their Brevity, ſeem'd inſignificant, in regard ſomething was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly omitted, and left to be underſtood, which cannot now be rightly ſupply'd, ſo as to arrive at the Mind of the Inventor. Of this Number may be this Motto, <hi>It is as it is,</hi> which was embroider'd upon a Doublet of that King; tho' there are others which ſeem more eaſy to be decypher'd; as that daring Motto wrought upon his Surcoat and Shield provided to be uſed at a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,</p>

For ſhould we admit, that during ſome Part of the Solemnity held in this King's 18th Year, when the Accident of the Lady's Garter ſlipping off happen'd, what other Inference can be made, but that he had only an Intention to put in Execution ſomewhat afterwards?

the Splendidneſs of the Feſtivity, it was too buſy a Time to ſuffer much Conſultation tending thereunto; or at leaſt to mould and model a Deſign ſo compleat and ſubſtantial, as it appears to have been even at firſt. If we joyn <hi>Fabian,</hi> he is plain, that tho' the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the Inſtitution at the End of the Feſtival, (which he places between <hi>Candlemas</hi> and <hi>Lent,</hi> in the 19th, and not 18th Year of that King) <hi>Yet was it not then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but afterwards eſtabliſh'd by him.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> elſewhere obſerves, it had its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in the 24th Year of the ſaid King. And our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious <hi>Stow</hi> (with whom <hi>Lily, Speed,</hi> and <hi>Segar</hi> agree) tells us, <hi>That the firſt Feaſt of the Order was celebrated</hi> A.

We muſt therefore have recourſe to ſome other Proofs for elucidating this Point, ſince this Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological <hi>Aera</hi> of the true Time of its Inſtitution hath wonderfully ſlipp'd the Pens of all Writers.</p>
               <p>ADMITTING then that the erecting this Order was firſt thought of by King <hi>Edward,</hi> at ſome of thoſe grand Aſſemblies of <hi>The Round Table,</hi> held after the <hi>French</hi> King had ſet up the like; yet was it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or brought to any Perfection, till after his glorious Victories and Triumphs over the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> in the Battles of <hi>Creſſy</hi> and <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Croſs, (in the laſt of which the <hi>Scotch</hi> King, <hi>David,</hi> was taken Priſoner) and until King <hi>Edward</hi> had <hi>Calais</hi> ſurrendred to him, as will appear very conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>AMONG the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe, is one containing the Account of all the King's Liveries, from <hi>Michaelmas Anno</hi> 21, to the 31ſt of <hi>Jan.</hi> 23 <hi>Edw.</hi> III.

            <head>CAP. VI. The Statutes and Annals of the Order.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <p>ORDER and Regularity is not only the Beauty and Symmetry of Government and Societies, but alſo greatly contributes to their Eſtabliſhment and Perpetuity. Statutes and Rules are as well the Bounds to determine, as Bonds to unite Fellowſhip and Societies together; and if either fall into difuſe, or be unadviſedly broken, they open a Field to Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Ruin.</p>
               <p>SUCH like Conſiderations mov'd and excited the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious King <hi>Edward</hi> III. (after he had determin'd the Erection of this moſt renown'd <hi>Order of the Garter)</hi> to <hi>deviſe and inſtitute ſeveral laudable Statutes and Ordinances, to be duly obſerv'd and kept within the ſaid Order;</hi> which being collected into one Body, are call'd <hi>The Statutes of Inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Original of theſe was ordain'd to be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Treaſury of the College of <hi>Windſor,</hi> but hath long ſince wholly periſh'd; yet a Tranſcript of them is recorded in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. in an old Book call'd <hi>Regiſtrum Ordinis Chartaceum.</hi> Two more ancient <hi>Exemplars</hi> of this Body of Statutes are alſo in being; the one in the Library of the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Black Book</hi> of the Order; and comparing them together, I ſhall here give from the <hi>Latin</hi> the Heads they conſiſt of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THE King of <hi>England,</hi> his Heirs and Succeſſors, are to be Sovereigns or Superiors of this Order.</p>
               <p n="2">2. NONE are to be admitted, unleſs he be a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Blood, and that he be a Knight and without Reproach.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE Knights-Companions were to be Twenty Six, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ach to have at <hi>Windſor</hi> a Mantle and Garter for the better Splendor of the Order; to wear the ſaid
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0739200500:142"/>
Habit whenſoever they go to the Chapel of St. <hi>George</hi> or Chapter-Houſe, to hold a Chapter, or do any thing relating to their Order. In like manner they are to wear the Habit upon the Vigils of St. <hi>George,</hi> in their Proceſſion from the King's Lodgings to the Chapel or Chapter-Houſe, and returning back, and during Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, continue ſo habited till it be over, and likewiſe on the Morrow of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day, at Chapel, Dinner-time, Supper-time, and afterwards all the ſaid Day, until the Sovereign or his Deputy ſhall depoſite the Enſigns of the Order, and decree their Departure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THERE were to be Thirteen Canons Secular, who at the Time of their Inſtitution, or within a Year, were to be Prieſts, and as many Vicars already Prieſts, or to be made ſo at the next Ordination, anſwerable to the number of the Knights-Companions; theſe religious Perſons to be preſented by the ſeveral Founders each one, and upon the Death or Vacancy of ſuch preſented, the Sovereign of the Order ever afterwards to have the Nomination of them, who were bound to pray for the good Eſtate of the Sovereign and his Kingdom, and particularly for this Order.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THE Canons were to wear a Purple Mantle, with the Arms of St. <hi>George</hi> in a Roundle upon their right Shoulder.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THERE were to be Twenty Six poor veterane Knights, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ach to have a competent Subſiſtence, their Election to be after the manner of the Canons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p n="7">7. THESE Knights were to have a Red Mantle, with the Arms of St. <hi>George;</hi> but without any Circle of the Garter about it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. IF the Sovereign could not be preſent at the ſolemn Feſtival of St. <hi>George,</hi> his Deputy was to ſupply his Place at the Charge of the Sovereign; but ſuch Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not to make any new Ordinances, tho' he has Licenſe to correct or amend the old Ones.</p>
               <p n="9">9. EVERY Year, upon the Vigils of St. <hi>George,</hi> the Knights-Companions within the Realm, or elſewhere, if conveniently, are to aſſemble, at <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, and be preſent there at the Celebration of Divine Service, in the Habit of the Order, where placed regularly in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0739200500:143"/>
their Stalls or Seats, directly over their Heads their Helmets and Swords, &amp;c. are to be hung up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as long as ſuch Knights live, in Honour of them, and to ſignify the Defence of the Church, to which they are obliged as a Military Order; but in caſe the Feaſt of St. <hi>George</hi> happens to fall within the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene or Fifteen Days after the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> then it was to be prorogued to the <hi>Sunday</hi> next following, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting Fifteen Days from <hi>Eaſter</hi> Day, that every Knight-Companion might have reaſonable time to come, nor be forced to ride upon any of the Three <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holy-days.</p>
               <p n="10">10. THAT they meet in St. <hi>George</hi>'s Chapel yearly, on the Eve of St. <hi>George,</hi> at the Hour of Three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; and if they come not at the Time aſſigned, without a juſt Excuſe, which the Sovereign or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty allows, their Penalty is to be according to the Ordinance of the Chapter; which is, That they ſhall not enter into the Chapter Door for that time, but ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like Penalty is ordain'd for not coming to the Maſs or Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Service betime, and at Veſpers, on St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day; and whoſoever ſhall abſent himſelf wholly from this Solemnity, without ſufficient Excuſe and Leave from the Sovereign or Deputy, he is not to enter within his Stall the next Feaſt after, but ſhall ſtay below, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Stall, as it is ſaid at Veſpers, and in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows Proceſſion muſt walk before the Three proceſſional Croſſes, [now the Cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After which he is to come before the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, or his Deputy's Stall, and ask Pardon, which re-inſtates him in his Stall. Abſenting the next ſecond Time upon the Feaſt, without Leave, he has no Stall allowed him until he hath given and offered a Jewel upon St. <hi>George</hi>'s Altar, to the Value of Twenty Marks, which is to be double every Year until a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>

11. WHERESOEVER they be, they muſt wear their Blue Robes from the Beginning of the firſt Veſpers, on the Eve of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day, to the ſecond Veſpers on the Morrow incluſive, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">12. IF any Knight-Companion appears publickly without his dignifying Garter, upon challenging the ſame, is to pay half a Mark to the Cuſtos and College.</p>
               <p n="13">13. AT the Times of Offering, each aſſociated with the other who holds the oppoſite Stall, are to march in Proceſſion together to make their Offerings; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, when his Conſort is abſent, and ſo that in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions the Sovereign goes laſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14. IN the Morrow after the Solemnity of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Feaſt is over, before their ſeparating, a Maſs <hi>de Requie</hi> or Office <hi>de Defunctis</hi> was to be uſed, at which the Knights-Companions were all entirely to be preſent, without neceſſary Impediment ſhown to the Sovereign or Deputy for Liberty to depart.</p>
               <p n="15">15. THEY were to leave their Robes at <hi>Windſor</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, to be ready for them there upon any ſudden Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that might evene.</p>
               <p n="16">16. JOURNYING near <hi>Windſor,</hi> in Honour of the Place, unleſs lawful Cauſe obſtructs, they muſt take it in their Way, and aſſuming the Habit of the Order the Canons wore, devoutly to meet and conduct them into the Chapel; where, if it happens to be time of Divine Service, they are to hear the ſame; if not, they are to be detained no longer than while the Canons ſhall ſay the Pſalm <hi>de profundis</hi> for the Defunct, and during their own Offering: But if any had riden thro' the Town, without viſiting the Chapel and offering there, for every Neglect he muſt go one Mile on Foot from the ſaid Chapel, to ſhew his Obedience, and offer an Half-Penny in Honour of St. <hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. UPON firſt Notice of the Death of any of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Sovereign ſhall ordain a Thouſand Maſſes, every Foreign Prince ſhall cauſe Eight Hundred, a Prince of Wales Seven Hundred, a Duk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

which neglected for a Quarter of a Year after notice of ſuch Death, the Maſſes are to be doubled; upon half a Year's Neglect, again doubled; and ſo from Time to Time in like Form till the End of the Year, and then the Year's to be doubled.</p>
               <p n="18">18. UPON ſure Notice of the Death of a Knight-Companion, the Sovereign, or his Deputy, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe by Letters, the Remainder [not Strangers] that are within the Kingdom, to meet him within Six Weeks in ſome convenient Place, and elect another; which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, at leaſt Six, with the Sovereign or Deputy, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them preſent is to name Nine of the worthieſt and ſufficienteſt Knights without Reproof that he knows, whether native Subjects or Foreigners, ſobeit they hold no contrary Party, or be againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, <hi>viz.</hi> Three Earls, or of ſublimer Title; Three Barons, and Three Knights Batchellors, which Names the Biſhop of <hi>Windſor,</hi> for the Time being, was to write, or, in his Abſence, the Dean or Regiſter, and, in their Abſence, the oldeſt Reſidencer in the College, and after ſhew them to the Sovereign, who is to chuſe out of them him that has the moſt Voices, and whom he eſteems the moſt beneficial to the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Every Knight failing to appear at an Election, without an approved Cauſe, was to pay to the Cuſtos and College the Penalty of a Mark, and at his next coming to the Chapter ſhall kneel upon the Ground, in the midſt of the Chapter, before the Sovereign or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, until Reconciliation.</p>
               <p n="19">19. SOON after Election, the Knight-Companion elect is to have a Garter, in token of his Election, and that he is a Fellow of the Order; and as ſoon as decreed to take Poſſeſſion of his Stall, but not before, is to have a Mantle, which, if he dies before he receiv'd, he was not to be accounted as one of the Order, becauſe he wanted Poſſeſſion; nevertheleſs he was to have one half of the Maſſes aboveſaid, becauſe he had the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deliver'd to him and nothing beſide. If he was not inſtalled within a Year after his receiving the Garter, and eſpecially if within the Realm, and without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Excuſe to be allowed of by the Sovereign or Deputy, his Election became void, and they might proceed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0739200500:146"/>
to a new one: Moreover, neither the Sword nor Helmet was to be put upon his Stall within the Caſtle, before his coming; to the End, that if the Knight elect came not, his Atchievements might not be unhandſomly taken down and abuſed, but honourably removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Choir for the publick Uſe and Profit of the ſaid College.</p>
               <p n="20">20. EVERY Foreigner elected was to have Certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch his Election from the Sovereign, at the Sovereign's Charge, who was to ſend him the Garter and the Mantle, and a Copy of the Statutes of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, under the Common Seal of the ſaid Order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Four Months after the Election, the better for him to adviſe on; which being accepted, of whatſoever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he be, he was obliged within Eight Months after to ſend a ſufficient Proxy, according to his State and Dignity, a Knight irreprehenſible to be inſtalled in his Room, and who was to bring with him a Silk Mantle of the Blue Colour of the Order, alſo a Sword and Helmet to remain at <hi>Windſor,</hi> which Mantle was be put upon the right Shoulder of the Proxy, by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign or Deputy at the time of Inſtallment, when he is introduced to take the Stall in the Name of his Lord and Maſter; neither was he to depoſite the ſame till the End of Divine Service; after which he was not to wear it, nor be admitted in the Chapter-Houſe, or have any Suffrage, by virtue of any Powers veſted in him; but this Favour Foreigners elected by Proxy were to have, that could not perſonally come themſelves, they were to be Partakers of the whole Maſſes and Oriſons of the Order; whereas, if they died before the Inſtallation, they were to have but a Moity of them.</p>

EVERY Knight-Companion at his firſt Entrance, was to give a certain Alms, according to their Eminence and Degree, for the perpetual Maintenance of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Poor Knights, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sovereign Forty Marks, a Foreign King Twenty Pounds, a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> Twenty Marks, a Duke Ten Pounds, an Earl Ten Marks, a Baron a Hundred Shillings, and a Knight Batchellor Five Marks, that by theſe pious Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="23">23. UPON the Death of any of the Founders his Arms, in a Plate of Metal, was to be fixed upon the Back of his Stall, and their Succeſſors were to have the like, but to be placed underneath their Predeceſſors, and not to be ſo great as thoſe of the firſt Founders.</p>
               <p n="24">24. AT Admiſſion every Knight-Companion muſt promiſe and ſwear perſonally, or by Proxy, faithfully to obſerve the Statutes of the Order, and none are to be inſtalled by Proxy but Foreigners only, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently come in Perſon.</p>
               <p n="25">25. IF the Sovereign be out of <hi>England</hi> at the Inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any Knight-Companion, or could not attend himſelf to do what appertains to him in that Point, he might impower and authorize any of the Fellows to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate for him.</p>
               <p n="26">26. THAT there be a Common Seal or Signet Keeper, whom the Sovereign was to aſſign.</p>
               <p n="27">27. EVERY Knight-Companion was to have a Copy of the Statutes under the Seal of the Order, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſealed likewiſe with the ſaid Seal, to remain for evermore within the Treaſury of the College, and upon the Death of any Knight-Companion, his Executors were to ſend back ſuch Copy to be deliver'd to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos or Warden.</p>
               <p n="28">28. NO Knight-Companion was to go out of the Realm and Dominion of <hi>England,</hi> without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="29">29. THEY were not to arm themſelves againſt each other, but in the Wars of their Sovereign Lord, in his right and juſt Quarrel; and if it happen'd that any of the Order ſhould be retain'd in the Cauſe and Quarrel of any Lord, and the adverſe Party deſir'd another Knight-Companion on his Side, that latter Knight isby no means to agree but to excuſe himſelf in all Things, becauſe his Fellow was armed on the other Side, and was retain'd before him. And every Knight was bound to except and agree, at his being retain'd, that he may have his Diſcharge from the Wars, upon any of the Order's being engaged in Arms before him for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party; and if the ſecond retained knows not of it, upon notice that any of his Fellows were retained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and armed on the contrary Side, the ſecond retained Knight was to excuſe himſelf to his Maſter, and relinquiſh the Quarrel.</p>

               <p>§ 3. THERE have been ſeveral Endeavours ſince the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. for reforming the Statutes. As firſt, King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. who as Sovereign, by the Orders themſelves, had an undoubted Prerogative ſet him to alter and reform many Things which ſeem'd inconſiſtent with the Religion he eſtabliſh'd. To which Purpoſe, at a Chapter at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> held <hi>April</hi> 23. in the Third Year of his Reign, the Lord <hi>St. John,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Paget,</hi> were to peruſe and make them agreeable to the King's other Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by the Aſſiſtance and Advice of the Protector, the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and other Companions. This was follow'd by a ſubſequent Order paſs'd in the Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter at <hi>Greenwich</hi> the Year after, that the Statutes ſhould be reform'd and corrected as they thought expedient: And for the better Accompliſhment of their Deſign, at the next Feaſt, <hi>April</hi> 24. 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. another Order commenc'd, impowering the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Arundel, Bedford</hi> and <hi>Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ts,</hi> to peruſe and amend the Statures and other Books of the Order, which were brought to ſome tolerable Degree of Perfection; for thereupon a new Body was collected (in general very much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws of the Order) and publiſh'd <hi>March</hi> 17. <hi>Anno</hi> 7 <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. But this King within Four Months after expiring, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> his Siſter and Succeſſor, the very firſt Thing ſhe tranſacted was to abrogate and make them void; wherefore we need not mention them, as never in uſe and unrevived. For the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which Purpoſe, ſhe conven'd a Chapter at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, the 27th of <hi>September</hi> following; and it was then decreed, that the ſaid Laws and Ordinances, as inconvenient, impertinent, and tending to Novelty,

ſhould be diſannulled, and no Account to be made of them for the future; and for the quicker Execution, Sir <hi>William Petre</hi> (that Day admitted Chancellor) had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſee them ſpeedily expung'd out of the Book of Statutes, and forthwith defac'd, leſt any Memory of them ſhould remain to Poſterity; and only thoſe of her Father, <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. and his Royal Predeceſſors, ſhould be retain'd.</p>

               <p>AFTER we find <hi>Richard Sidnor</hi> mention'd in the Regiſter <hi>Anno</hi> 16 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII.

               <p>BESIDES this there is another Book that goes by the Name of the <hi>Black Book,</hi> wherein the Annals of the Order are tranſcribed in <hi>Latin,</hi> concerning which there paſs'd a Decree, <hi>Anno</hi> 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. that it ſhould be fairly copy'd out, and afterwards that the Sovereign ſhould be put in Remembrance of it; but neither of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees was put in execution, nor was this confirm'd till towards the End of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. This Book differs very little from the <hi>Regiſtrum Chartaceum,</hi> for therein is nothing enrolled relating to the Order (except one of the Exemplars of the Founders Statutes, and a Catalogue of the firſt Twenty-five Knights-Companions) before the 4th Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. the Annals of the Order, until that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely loſt.

THE Regiſter of the Order was oblig'd to provide Two Books, and therein to enter the Ordinances, Statutes, and Acts of this Noble Corporation, one to be lodg'd at the Chapter Houſe at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and call'd, <hi>Index Windeſorienſis,</hi> and the other being a Duplicate of the former, to remain in his own Cuſtody, ready to expoſe to the View of the Sovereign, whenſoever he ſhould demand it; this latter was called <hi>Aulae Regiſtrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS to the general Directions for Compiling theſe Books, and the Particulars they are to conſiſt of, we are inform'd from the ſaid Statutes and Conſtitutions; for beſides the Entry of all the Scrutinies taken in Chapter and Elections made thereupon, it is his Office to record the Penalties inflicted on Knights-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the Reconciliation of all Delinquents with other Acts, and their Cauſes appertaining to the Order, all which are decreed to be recited before the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and Knights-Companions at the Beginning of the Chapter yearly, if Occaſion be, to correct and reduce into Method. Moreover he is to record all the Policies in War, Exploits, Tranſactions, and memorable Atchievements, both of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, according as he can beſt attain the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, by his own diligent Search, or the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Mr. Garter, which having conſign'd to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from Year to Year, is to be peruſed at the next Chapter by the Knights-Companions, for their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Correction; and being reiterated the ſecond time in the Chapter, he is to ſee that they be fairly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in the ſaid Book, for a perpetual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>AND becauſe the time perfix'd for Rehearſal of theſe Particulars in Chapter, had in ſucceeding Years been imploy'd in other Affairs. In one of thoſe Articles which the Knights-Companions exhibited to King <hi>Jac.</hi> I. the 19th of <hi>May, Anno Jac.</hi> R. 20. and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the 22d of <hi>May</hi> following, it was decreed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Nature, or any other Act in Chapter, ſhould be regiſtred before it had been perus'd and paſs'd the Conſideration of the then Knights-Companions, or at leaſt Four of them, who when they ſhould ſet Times apart to conſult of the Affairs of this Order (for which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0739200500:162"/>
they were chiefly commiſſion'd) might then alſo make Uſe of ſuch Opportunities as ſhould give this Buſineſs Diſpatch with more Conveniency. Upon mature Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration had of thoſe Injunctions, the then Regiſter at a Chapter held 19 <hi>Nov.</hi> 22 <hi>Car.</hi> II. preſented the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Annals of this Order, which he had ranged in order to regiſter in the <hi>Liber Carolinus,</hi> and ſubmitted them to the Approbation of the Knights-Companions, whom the Sovereign had commiſſion'd to inſpect the Affairs of the Order; which Tender, when they declin'd, he propos'd that it might paſs the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Prelate; but they not giving the ir Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, in regard the Regiſter himſelf was under the Obligation of an Oath, to deal with the utmoſt Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in his Reports, it was decreed, That the ſaid Annals ſhould be fairly recorded in the Book, without any further Inſpection.</p>
               <p>BESIDES the abovemention'd Particulars, there were Materials of another Nature, decreed to be collected by the Chancellor of the Order and Garter King of Arms, to be digeſted firſt, and after entred by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter; for whereas one part of the Chancellor's Duty was to make a Narration every Year in Chapter, at the Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> of the illuſtrious Exploits of the Knights-Companions, as well as the Actions that tend to eclipſe their Glory; ſo the Regiſter was to note theſe, and record them from a perpetual Aera or Memorial of their Honour or Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>AND it is part of Garter's Duty diligently to enquire after the Valiant, Fortunate, and Renown'd Acts, both of the Sovereign and the reſt of the Knights-Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and relate them with all Exactneſs to the Regiſter, for his Engroſſing: But how ſparingly theſe are put in execution, the Annals themſelves bear witneſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Sir <hi>Edward Walker</hi> Garter-King has drawn up an Account of the ſhining Actions and Characters of the Knights-Companions, beginning with <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and continuing it down to his Son, which he deliver'd Dr. <hi>Ryves</hi> the Regiſter, for the Uſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directed.</p>
               <p>AMONG the Articles eſtabliſh'd at the Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. the laſt is, That the then Regiſter
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0739200500:163"/>
ſhould compoſe a Book, wherein ſhould be orderly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Form and Manner of all the Solemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ties, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and Proceſſions, at the Celebration of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; as alſo of taking down and offering the defunct Knight's A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chievements, that the Knights-Companions might have free Recourſe to it; but ſuch Book never was extant.</p>
               <p>For the Safety and Preſervation of the <hi>Annals,</hi> the Knights-Commiſſioners determined the 22d of <hi>May, An. Jac.</hi> I. 20. That a ſecure and convenient Place within the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor</hi> ſhould be appointed, in which all Acts concerning the Order ſhould be repoſed, and to which every Knight-Companion at all times might have acceſs. And upon the Remove or Deceaſe of the Regiſter of the Order, the Book, containing the Account of all ſuch Tranſactions, ſhould be committed to one of the Knights of the Order.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of theſe Books is called the <hi>Blue Book,</hi> ſo call'd, being bound in Blue Velvet; it begins with the firſt Year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and ends at the 18th of King <hi>Jac.</hi> I.</p>
               <p>The third being bound in Red Velvet, is denominated the <hi>Red Book;</hi> it commences where the <hi>Blue Book</hi> leaves off, and treats of the like Acts and Entries, and is carry'd down to 14 <hi>Car.</hi> I. having firſt given a full Account of the Inſtallation of the Prince, afterwards King <hi>Charles</hi> II. And as to great part of this Work, it was perform'd by the elegant and judicious Dr. <hi>Matthew Wren,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and Regiſter of the Order, whoſe excellent Pattern his Brother and Succeſſor Dr. <hi>Chriſtopher W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Leg; but there's no doubt but it was wrought with rich Embroidery, and the Motto rais'd with Gold, Pearl, and ſundry Sorts of Silk, as may be gueſs'd from the Garters anciently plac'd on the left ſide of the Knights-Companions Mantles, and thoſe other little embroider'd Garters, wherewith their Surcoats and Hoods were heretofore embelliſh'd.</p>
               <p>BUT of thoſe wrought in the laſt Age, we have more particular Satisfaction; for we find the Garter ſent to <hi>Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy, Anno</hi> 1 and 2 <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> was ſet with Letters of Goldſmith's Work, the Buckle and Pendant of the ſame, and on the Pendant a Ruby, and a Pearl hanging at the End. The Garter made for <hi>Francis</hi> II. <hi>Anno</hi> 6 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was richly wrought with Letters of Gold, ſet off and garniſh'd with Stones, the Buckle and Pendant weighing Three Ounces and an half-quarter, was richly ſet with Rubies and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. The <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had a Garter of Purple Velvet embroider'd with Letters of Gold, and deck'd out with Diamonds and Rubies. And the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> IV. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> was embroider'd with Gold and Pearls: But that Garter ſent to <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> outvied all others conferr'd by former Sovereigns, each Letter of the Motto being compos'd of ſmall Diamonds; and for every Stop, a Diamond within a Range of Diamonds, above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, on the ſides of the Garter, and beſides other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds on the Buckle, and about the ſame, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in all of 411.</p>
               <p>THE Garter which King <hi>Charles</hi> I. wore upon his Leg at the Time of his Martyrdom, had the Letters of the Motto compos'd likewiſe of Diamonds, which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Number of 412. It came to the Hands of Captain <hi>Preſton</hi> (one of the Uſurper's Captains) from whom the Truſtees, for Sale of the King's Goods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it, and ſold it to <hi>Ireton,</hi> ſometimes Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> for 205 <hi>l.</hi> But after the Reſtoration, the King's Attorney-General proceeding upon an Action of <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Converſion,</hi> Verdict was given for the King againſt him for 205 <hi>l.</hi> and 10 <hi>l.</hi> coſts of Suits, in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term, 16 <hi>Car.</hi> II.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0739200500:167"/>
THE Motto of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was ſet with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds upon Blue Velvet, and the Borders wrought with fine Gold Wire; the Diamonds which framed the Letters of the Motto, were Roſe Diamonds, much of a Size or Proportion; but thoſe which framed the Stops, Table-Diamonds; the Total which ſet each Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, compos'd the Stops, Ilot Holes, and adorn'd the Buckle; the Table was Two Hundred and Fifty; the Hinge of the Buckle was pure Gold, and on it the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's Picture to the Breaſt, curiouſly cut in Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitch, crown'd with a Laurel and the military Garb of the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; the Table or Pendant was Gold, and on the back-ſide thereof engrav'd St. <hi>George</hi> on Horſe-back encountring the Dragon.</p>
               <p>THIS noble Enſign, the Garter, was at the Erection of the Order appointed to be wore on the left Leg, a little beneath the Knee, which Uſage ſtill preſides: And the placing it thus, on the Sepulchral Portraictures of Knights-Companions, was an early Cuſtom; for on the Alabaſter Monument of Sir <hi>William Fitz-warin,</hi> who was interr'd in the North-ſide of the Chancel at <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> in <hi>Com. Berks,</hi> 35 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. he lies there with his Surcoat of Arms upon his Breaſt, and the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Garter (but without Motto) carv'd upon his left Leg. In the ſame Poſture lies Sir <hi>Richard Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> elected a Knight-Companion, <hi>temp. Edw.</hi> III. and is portraicted on his Monument in the South-ſide of the Cathedral of <hi>Hereford,</hi> below the Pulpit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with a Rail of Iron-Spikes.</p>
               <p>THE next Monument whereon the Garter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted, was that erected for Sir <hi>Simon Burley,</hi> (beheaded <hi>A. D.</hi> 1388.) and rear'd in the North-Wall near the Choir of St. <hi>Paul's, London.</hi> Thence-forward the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice became more frequent, and then the Motto began to be cut thereon; inſomuch that it is now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and juſt Practice to do it, whenſoever the Knights-Companions are exhibited in Effigies.</p>
               <p>AND altho' this Enſign was firſt deſign'd in Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the left Leg, yet it was not confin'd ſo ſolely thereto, but was anciently us'd to incircle the Eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Arms, worn by the Sovereign and Knights-Companions on their Mantles, who within a

ſmall ſpace after us'd it to ſurround their own proper Coat of Arms, which their Succeſſors have retain'd as their peculiar Privilege, permitting it to none but to their principal Officer, the Prelate of the Order.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Example that occurs, is the before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd of Sir <hi>Francis Burley,</hi> where, on the Front, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Head, is his own Arms empaling his firſt Wife's, ſet within a Garter, (wanting the Impreſs;) but another having the ſame Empalement, (plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Feet) is ſurrounded with a Collar of SS. of the ſame Form with that about his Neck.</p>
               <p>THE Monument alſo of <hi>Joan,</hi> Wife of <hi>Ralph Nevil,</hi> Earl of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> on the South-ſide of the Choir, in the Cathedral of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> bears the Arms of <hi>Nevil,</hi> empaling thoſe of <hi>Joan,</hi> his Wife, (who dy'd <hi>A. D.</hi> 1410.) Incircled within a Garter, and fix'd on this Lady's Monument, Daughter to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gount,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> is there ſuch a Collar of SS. placed about a Square; but the Paint being faded, was render'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER antique Inſtance is that Eſcutcheon, <hi>Sable, Three Oſtrich Feathers Argent,</hi> ſurrounded with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, affix'd in the Glaſs-Windows of <hi>Greenwich</hi>-Church in <hi>Kent,</hi> by <hi>Humfrey,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and ſupported with a Greyhound and an Antelope. It is reported, theſe Three Feathers were the Enſign of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. which were conferr'd by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> his Father, who bore them for his Device, and placed in a <hi>Field Sable,</hi> as here, but the Pens were powder'd with <hi>Ermin,</hi> for a difference from the Black Prince's Feather, which were <hi>Argent,</hi> as the King's Pen was <hi>Or,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Compony <hi>Argent</hi> and <hi>Azure.</hi>

Concerning the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the Knights-Companions, there is no doubt but they were of the ſame Materials with thoſe made for the Sovereign, <hi>viz.</hi> at firſt of fine Woollen Cloth, and when the Sovereign exchanged it for Velvet, they followed his Example; but we cannot meet with equal Satisfaction in this Point, becauſe the Knights-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions provided this Robe at their own Expence; and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0739200500:173"/>
their private Accounts herein paſſing thro' ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences, were of no great Durability. But their Surcoats were of the Sovereigns Donation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Particulars of them remain on Record in the Rolls and Accounts of the great Wardrobe.</p>
                  <p>THE Colour of theſe Mantles is appointed by the Statutes to be Blue, and of this Colour was the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; by which, as by the Ground-work of the Royal Garter, it is not improbable he alluded to the Colour of the Field in the <hi>French</hi> Arms, which a few Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to Quarter with thoſe of <hi>England.</hi> But the Colour of the Surcoat was changed every Year, as will appear by and by. Of the ſame Colour were the Velvet Mantles, made <hi>temp. Hen.</hi> VI. who tho' he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Stuff, did not vary the Dye. It is apparent, that the blue Colour was retained to King <hi>Edw.</hi> IVth's Reign, for when this Sovereign tranſmitted the Habit and Enſigns of the Order to <hi>Julian de Medicis,</hi> the Mantle was of blue Velvet.</p>
                  <p>BUT in King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIIIth's Statutes there's no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all of the Colour of this upper Robe, ſave only of the <hi>Mantle,</hi> which the Proxy of a Foreign Prince was enjoined to bring with him when he came to aſſume the Stall of his Principal; which, tho' it does not come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly up to the Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Third Enſign of the Order is the <hi>Surcoat</hi> or <hi>Kirtle,</hi> which altho' we find no Place for it in the Founder's Statutes, is nevertheleſs as ancient as the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or upper Robe, that is only taken Notice of there, for ſuch a Veſture King <hi>Edward</hi> III. then made, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Mantle and a Hood to celebrate the firſt Feaſt of the Order in.</p>
               <p>ITS Original it owes to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom this Garment had its determinated <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> and was worn next under the <hi>Toga,</hi> but amongſt them was both narrower and ſhorter; it was girt cloſe to the Body with a Girdle, and ſo fitted, that the Hem of it reached a little below the Knee, or to the middle of the Ham. It was the proper Mode of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and by its trimming were the three Degrees among them known; for the Senators Tunicks were embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or purfled over with broad purple Studs, the Knights with narrow ones, and the Plebeians plain.</p>
               <p>IN ſetting forth the Surcoat, which was heretofore annually beſtowed by the Sovereign or the Knights-Companions, and therefore called his <hi>Livery,</hi> we ſhall, as in the Deſcription of the Mantle, treat ſomewhat of the Name, Materials, Colour, Quantity and Garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>

Afterwards the beforementioned Four Colours began to be diſuſed, for the Surcoat preſented to <hi>Julian de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, temp. Edward</hi> IV. was purple Velvet, and towards the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and ſince, it is upon Record, the Surcoats of the Sovereign and all the Knights-Companions were Crimſon Velvet, nor did the Colour ſuffer a Mutation in the Surcoat, tho' King <hi>Charles</hi> I. reſtored the Mantle to its firſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Colour, <hi>Anno</hi> 12 <hi>Regni ſui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE has been ſome diſproportion in the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Cloth allowed in the Proviſion againſt one and the ſame Feaſt, for <hi>Anno</hi> 34 <hi>Edward</hi> III. the Earls of <hi>Stafford, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as alſo Sir <hi>Thomas Ughtred</hi> had then for each of their Surcoats fix Ells of Cloth (perhaps the tallneſs of their Stature required it) when the other Fifteen Knights were allowed but five Ells, being the ſame Quantity the Sovereign's Surcoat had contained in it at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>THE Dukes of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Clarence, Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Henry</hi> V. with the Earls of <hi>Arundel,</hi> were allowed Eight Ells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, the Dukes of <hi>Bedford, Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lords <hi>Grey,</hi>

                  </hi> with ſix Barons and five Knights Batchelors, but five Ells apiece. Afterwards, when the Number of Ells of Cloth, Garters and Furrs came to be aſcertained for each Degree, all the Knights-Companions (even the Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Length of King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Surcoat was one Yard and an half, and of the Sleeve one Yard wanting a Nail.</p>
               <p>THE Ornamental Trimmings of theſe Garments are next worthy of Note, eſpecially at the Time of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting this Order, for they were then, and a long time after, powdered all over with little Garters, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Silk and Gold-Plate, in each of which was neatly wrought the Motto, <hi>Honi ſoit,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides, the Buckles and Pendants to thoſe ſmall Garters, were Silver gilt; of theſe Garters there were no leſs than 160 upon the firſt Surcoat and Hood made for the Founder.</p>
               <p>IN King <hi>Richard</hi> II's Reign, the little Garters that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned the Surcoats of the Sovereign, and the other Knights were wrought in Embroidery upon blue Taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Cyprus, and Soldat Gold and Silk of divers Colours, and the Letters Gold. And as the Sovereign was not limited in the Proportion of Cloth or Velvet for his Surcoat, no more was he confined to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Garters, wherewith to adorn it; nor do I find that any of the Knights-Companions were, until the Precedent of the Livery of the Garter was ſettled, for <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Henry</hi> V. the Dukes of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Claren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>ABOUT the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. the Sovereigns Number of Garters did not much exceed thoſe which the Founder allow'd to himſelf at the Inſtitution; for the Surcoat and Hood of the ſaid King conſiſted of 173; and the King of <hi>Portugal, Anno</hi> 13 <hi>Henry</hi> VI. 120 Garters. But this Drapery of their Robes became at length quite obſolete, perhaps when Cloth was altered to Velvet, and the plain Surcoat hath to this Day continued in Uſe.</p>
               <p>WHILE theſe Surcoats remained of Cloth, they were lined with Bellies of pure Minever Fur, only the Sovereigns was purfled with Ermin; and of theſe, it ſeems, a like Proportion was at firſt ſtated to all the Knights-Companions, <hi>viz.</hi> 200 Bellies. Yet in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> II. ſome Difference began in the Allowance to the Knights-Companions, for a Baron, and all Degrees upward had 200 Bellies; but under a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron 120 only. However, <hi>Anno</hi> 1. <hi>Henry</hi> V. the Barons were tantamount to the Knights-Batchelors, for all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above a Baron were allow'd, a Fur of 200 Bellies. But the Barons and Knights-Batchelors Furs were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 120 Bellies.</p>
               <p>AFTERWARDS, by the Precedent of the Garter, there was another Proportion limited, the Prince, a Duke, a Marquis, an Earl, had each of them Five Timber of pure Minever allowed to a Surcoat; but the Viſcount, Baron, Baronet and Batchelor-Knights but Three Timber apiece. In time theſe Furs were diſuſed, and the Surcoats came to be lined with white Sarcenet, to which, <hi>temp. Eliz.</hi> white Taffaty ſucc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eded, and that ſtill continues.</p>
               <p>WHAT became of the old Surcoats, ſince the Knights-Companions had new ones every Year, the Black Book of the Order informs us, That on the Eve of the Feaſt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0739200500:181"/>
of St. <hi>George,</hi> the Knights wore to Veſpers, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns Livery or Surcoats, uſed by them the preceding Year, which after that Night they threw off, (for the new Surcoats were worn on the Feaſt-Day); but the Enſigns and Ornaments of this Kind were diſpoſed of to the Uſe of the Colledge.</p>
               <p>THE Hood and Cap comes in the next Place to be ſpoken of, which Hood in King, <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and the Black Book of the Order is called <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merale;</hi> but in the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe, <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium.</hi> In the <hi>French</hi> it is <hi>Chaperon,</hi> a Word uſed in the Statute, <hi>Anno</hi> 1. <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>C.</hi> 7. and alſo retained in the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Copy of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's Statutes made of his Reign, and annexed to this Treatiſe. They were anciently wore for Defence of the Head againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemencies of Weather, but of later Times Caps and Hats have ſupplied their place. How they ſat upon the Head, may be obſerved in the Portraitures of the firſt Founders; as alſo with ſome Variety of Faſhion in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages: Yet is not the Hood quite thrown by, ſince 'tis ſtill kept reclining upon the Back, almoſt like a Pilgrim's Hat.</p>
               <p>THIS Hood was ordained, and is yet retained as part of the Habit of this moſt Noble Order. And tho' neither it nor the Surcoat is mentioned in the Statutes of Inſtitution, or in either its Exemplars, nor doth King <hi>Henry</hi> V. lay any Streſs upon it, yet it is of equal Antiquity with the reſt, as appears from the Rolls of the great Wardrobe, and <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's Statutes have made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Obſervation of it, for the Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, and Collar are called the Habit of the Order: And in the Black Book, <hi>Anno</hi> 22. <hi>Henry</hi> VII. at the Inveſtiture of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Mantle, Kirtle, Hood and Collar are expreſly called <hi>Whole Habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT was heretofore, and now is generally made of the ſame Materials as the Surcoat, and was anciently trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſet off with a ſmall Proportion of Garters lined with Cloth of a different Colour, and ſuch as would beſt ſtrike the Sight; but now with Taffaty, as is the Lining of the Surcoat.</p>
               <p>AS to the Cap, which was inſtituted to ſucceed the Hood; it hath been, and yet is, faſhioned of black
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0739200500:182"/>
Velvet lin'd with Taffaty; but the Figure hath ſeveral Times varied; for <hi>Temp. Henry</hi> VIII. it was flat, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign it was a little raiſed in the Head; but in King <hi>James</hi>'s Time they were much more high-crown'd. This Cap hath been uſually adorn'd with Plumes of White Feathers, and Spriggs, and bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a Band ſet thick with Diamonds; ſo was the Cap for the Inſtallation of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and ſometimes the Brims have been tack'd up with a large and coſtly Jewel.</p>
               <p>THIS Cuſtom of wearing Caps and Feathers at the Grand Solemnities of the Order, had, for ſome Time, about the Beginning of King <hi>James</hi> I. Reign, been omitted, and thereupon, in a Chapter held the 13th of <hi>April, Anno</hi> 10. <hi>Jac.</hi> I. this commendable Cuſtom was re-eſtabliſh'd.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added the Croſs of the Order en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with a Garter, which by the Sovereign was ordain'd the 27th of <hi>April,</hi> 2 <hi>Car.</hi> I. to be worn upon the Left Side of the Cloaks, Coats, and riding Caſſocks of the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions, of the Prelate and Chancellor at all Times, when they were not adorn'd with their Robes, and in all Places and Aſſemblies (but not embelliſh'd with Pearls and Stones) that the wearing thereof might be a ſufficient Indication to the World, of that Height of Honour they arriv'd to from the ſaid moſt Noble Order, inſtituted for Perſons of the greateſt Merit and Worth.</p>
               <p>AND it was not long after e'er the Glory or Star, as it was uſually call'd, having certain Beams of Silver, that ſhot out in Form of a Croſs, was introduc'd and annex'd to it, in Imitation (as thought) of the <hi>French,</hi> who after the ſame manner wore the chief Enſign of the Order of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> being the Repreſentation of a Dove irradiated with ſuch like Beams.</p>
               <p>AND whereas ſome Painters affirm the Symbol of the Holy Ghoſt to be thus adorn'd congruous enough, yet cenſure it improper for a Garter, let them conſider that King <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. erected his White Roſe with the like Glory, whereof both the Stone Work and Wood Work of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Chapel in <hi>Windſor,</hi> manifeſtly illuſtrate, whoſe Antiquity makes a Precedent for it long before
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0739200500:183"/>
the Inſtitution of the Order of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but this King aſſum'd this Device upon appearance of three Suns, which ſuddenly united together into one immediately, before his ſucceſsful Victory at <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s-<hi>Croſs,</hi> a happy <hi>Aera</hi> he thought himſelf oblig'd to perpetuate. And they miſtake who ſuppoſe it to be the Garter that is thus irradiated, whereas it is ſomething elſe more worthy of the Glory, for from it, not the Garter, do the Rays diffuſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the inclos'd Croſs of the Order, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated as glorious, ſince it darted its bright Beams from Heaven, when it appear'd to <hi>Conſtantine the Great;</hi> as the ſame is repreſented on a Silver Medal: On the one Side whereof was a <hi>Buſt in profile,</hi> or ſide Face of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and on the Reverſe, this Badge of the Order, within a Garter, inſcrib'd, <hi>Honi,</hi> &amp;c. a Croſs irradiated, diſperſing its Beams in a Rhombular Form of Eight Angles, beyond the Orbit or bounding Lines of the ſaid Garter, having for Circumſcription, <hi>Priſci decus Ordmis Auctum,</hi> 1629.</p>

               <p>§ 5. HAVING finiſh'd our Diſcourſe concerning the Robes of the Order, we ſhall ſpeak of the robes and Hoods aſſign'd to the Queen, Knights-Companions Wives, and other great Ladies, by the Donation of the Sovereigns, ſet off and embelliſhed with Minute Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and lin'd with Rich Furs, which Robes they were adorn'd with during the Solemnity of the Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> a Cuſtom almoſt as ancient as its Inſtitution. The firſt Mention we find recorded of the Feminine Habit occurs, <hi>Anno</hi> 7. <hi>R.</hi> II. when the Queen, the Sovereign's Mother, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the Counteſſes of <hi>Cambridge, Buckingham, Pembroke, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Ladies <hi>Philippa</hi> and <hi>Catherine,</hi> Daughters to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mohun</hi> had ſuch kind of Robes and Hoods provided for them. They were made of Cloth, Violet in Grain, like as the Sovereign and Knights-Companions that Year, the Robes lin'd with Fur, but the Hoods with Scarlet, and both embroidered over with little Garters, and the Proportion of Cloth, Furs, and Garters, were ſtated according to their ſeveral Ranks and Degrees; for the Queen had Eight Ells, and Half an Ell of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0739200500:184"/>
Scarlet for the Lining of her Hood. The Sovereign's Mother had allow'd her one whole Piece, and a double Proportion of Scarlet; but from the large Quantity it is conceiv'd ſhe had Two Robes and Hoods made at this time: Beſides, the particular Number are but Eleven Perſons, and cannot elſe reach the Total of the Robes that were made up and expreſly ſet down to be Twelve. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had the Allowance of Half a Piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet; the Counteſs of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Seven Ells of Cloth and Half an Ell of Scarlet, and the reſt of the Ladies the ſame Proportion of Cloth with the Knights-Companions, <hi>i. e.</hi> each Five Ells a-piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet. According to their Cloth was alſo their Proportion of Minever; the Queen's Allowance was Two Furs, each containing Three Hundred Bellies of pure Minever; the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's Mother had twice that Proportion, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and Counteſs of <hi>Cambridge</hi> had the ſame Allowance as the Queen; but all the reſt of the Ladies had only one Fur of Two Hundred Bellies. Beſides the embroidered Garters to deck out the Twenty-four Surcoats of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, and the Twelve Robes for the Queen, and other Ladies, amounted to the Number of 2900.</p>
               <p>AGAINST the Feaſt of St. <hi>George, Anno.</hi> II. <hi>R.</hi> II. there were prepared Fifteen Robes and Hoods for the Queen and other Ladies, of the ſame Livery and ſuit with the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, <hi>viz.</hi> White long Cloth, and Blue Cloth for the Lining of their Hoods, bearing the ſame Proportion in all Things as the former, <hi>Anno</hi> 13. <hi>Rich.</hi> II. the Ladies Robes and Hoods were Sanguine Cloth, and the Lining of their Hoods Cloth in Grain. And in the 19th <hi>Rich.</hi> II. they were Blue Cloth, and long Cloth in Grain for Lining their Hoods. In both theſe Years we find the Dutcheſs of <hi>Aquitaine</hi> had double the Proportion of Cloth allow'd her (as had alſo the Dutcheſs of <hi>York) viz.</hi> Fourteen Ells, (the Queen having then but the former Allowance of Eight Ells) and yet her Proportion of Lining, both for the Robe and Hood, was no more than allow'd the Queen.</p>

BUT <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Henry</hi> V. the ſame Quantities of Cloth, Minevers, and Garters, were the ſame to Ladies of all Degrees, and that was to each Five Ells of White Woollen Cloth, only the Queen-Mother had Eight Ells of White Cloth and Eight Ells of Black Cloth, a Fee containing Two Hundred Bellies of Minever, and an Hundred embroidered Garters, and 12 <hi>Henry</hi> VI. the Maſter of the great Wardrobe was commanded to make ready the like Livery, both for Colour of Cloth, number of Ells, Bellies of Minever, and Garters, for the Counteſs of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> againſt the approaching Feaſt of St. <hi>George.</hi>

               <p>A plainer Narrative is made of theſe Liveries, <hi>Anno</hi> 16 <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. when at the Feaſt of St. <hi>George</hi> at <hi>Windeſor,</hi> the Queen, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King's Daughter, and Dutcheſs of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the King's Siſter, had for their Livery Murrey Gowns embroidered with Garters.</p>
               <p>BESIDES theſe Robes worn by the Ladies at the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals of the Order, there ſeems to be ſome Imitation of wearing a Garter alſo on their Left Arms, as the Knights did on their Left Leg, as it is obſerv'd on the Counteſs of <hi>Tankervile</hi>'s Monument, where ſhe is ſo pourtray'd.</p>
               <p>AFTER a long Diſuſe of theſe Robes, <hi>Anno</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> I. there was an endeavour to reſtore it; for the Deputy Chancellor ſollicited the Sovereign in Chapter, That the Ladies of the Knights-Companions might be granted the Privilege to wear a Garter of the Order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Arms, and an upper Robe at Feſtival Times, according to ancient Uſage, upon which Motion the Sovereign gave Order that the Queen's Pleaſure ſhould be known herein, and the Affair left to the Ladies particular Requeſt, and the Year enſuing, upon the Deputy Chancellor's Report at another Chapter at <hi>Windeſor,</hi> it was then left to a Chapter to be called by the Knights-Companions, to preponderate of every Circumſtance, how it were fitteſt to be effected for the Honour and Luſtre of the Order; which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be held at <hi>London</hi> about <hi>All-hollantide</hi> next; But the unhappy War breaking out, this Matter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely broke off.</p>

Their Workmanſhip ſeems won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully curious, being interſected with various Lines, and divided with Tablets and precious Stones. The Collar was of an illuſtrious Original among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and gave Denomination to the Family of <hi>Torquati,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>L.

And it's remarkable that when one of another Tribe was adopted into this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he did alſo aſſume this Badge of Honour, as in the Coin of <hi>D. Junius Silanus,</hi> tho' the Faſhion of the Work ſome what differ'd from the former.</p>
               <p>IN priſtine Times none but Kings and Princes wore Collars, and therefore their Uſe ſeems of Dignity and Power, as is evident from <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kings uſed this Ornament. Afterwards Men famous for Wiſdom and Council, had them as a diſtinguiſhing Badge, as in the Example of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who propoſed it as a Praemium to him that could interpret the Hand-Writing upon the Wall. And Men famous for Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Atchievements had it conferr'd upon them, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their Merits; thus Collars were of the Number of the <hi>Dona &amp; Praemia Militaria</hi> among the the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Honour of receiving them thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be conſign'd to Poſterity in Marble Inſcriptions. From them the later Emperors receiv'd it, and we read of inveſting a Knight of the <hi>Holy Sepulchre</hi> with a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0739200500:187"/>
Collar at his Creation; where, as ſoon as the Ceremony of his Ordination is over, the Padre Guardian Kiſſes the new Made Knight, and puts about his Neck (according to the mode of the Ancients) a Golden Collar, with a Croſs hanging at it.</p>
               <p>MOST aptly therefore have the Sovereigns of Military Orders annex'd this Ornament of the Collar to their Habit, and conferr'd it on the Fellows and Companions, many of whom have meritoriouſly deſerv'd it for their great Wiſdom and valorous Exploits, and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was inſtituted in additional Glory to the Enſigns of the Garter, compos'd in a peculiar manner, in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Name and Title; to the wearing of which the Sovereign oblig'd both himſelf and Knights-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and his and their Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>THIS Collar was ordain'd to be of Gold Thirty Ounces Troy weight, but not to exceed it; howbeit that Collar ſent to <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> weigh'd Thirty-four Ounces and a Quarter, and that of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. 35 Ounces and an Half; which, after his Sufferings, fell into the Hands of <hi>Thomas Harriſon,</hi> one of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Major-Generals, and was by him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Truſtees for Sale of the King's Goods: They, 1649. ſent it to the <hi>Mint,</hi> with divers of the <hi>Regalia,</hi> to ſet the Stamp on work for the firſt Gold that the upſtart Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT was appointed by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's Statutes, that this Collar ſhould be compos'd of Pieces of Gold in Faſhion of Garters, the Ground enamelled Blue, and the Letters of the Motto Gold; in the midſt of each Garter, Two Roſes plac'd, the innermoſt enamei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Red, and the outermoſt White, contrarily in the next Garter, the innermoſt Roſe enamelled White, and the outermoſt Red, and ſo alternately; but of lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Number of theſe Garters are ſo many as be the ordain'd Number of the Sovereign and Knights-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; at the Inſtitution they were Twenty-ſix, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſten'd together with as many Knots of Gold, and this Mode hitherto has continu'd invariable; nor ought the Collar to be adorn'd or enrich'd with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, (as the <hi>George</hi> may be) ſuch being prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the Law of the Order.</p>

AT the Middle of the Collar before pendant, at the Table of one of the Garters in the Collar is to be fix'd the Image of St. <hi>George</hi> arm'd ſitting on Horſeback, who having thrown the Dragon on his Back encounters him with a Tilting-Spear. This Jewel is not encompaſs'd with a Garter or Row of Diamonds, as in the leſſer <hi>George;</hi> but in round Relief. It is allow'd to be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſett off with Diamonds and other Enrichments, at the Pleaſure of the Knight-Companion who poſſeſſed it, and upon that Score it hath been frequently adorn'd with Variety of coſtly Work, whereon the Diamonds, and other precious Stones, being ſet to that Advantage as might, upon its Motion and Agitation, dart forth a reſplendent Luſtre.</p>
               <p>BEFORE the Eſtabliſhment of this Article by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. it appears that the Knights-Companions were inveſted with Collars at their Inſtallations, for the Black Book makes mention of a Collar among the Enſigns of the Garter, wherewith <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was inveſted, <hi>Anno</hi> 22 <hi>Henry</hi> VII. but whether a Collar of SS's, or of another Model, is not ſpecifi'd: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Scruple is in part clear'd up by an old Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the Ceremonies, at the Creating <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> 1 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. where it is ſaid in the Annals, that after he was inveſted with the Robes of his State and Dignity, the Collar of the Garter was put about his Neck at conſtituting him a Knight of the Order. And to make it more conſpicuous in a Vellum Book of the Statutes ſent to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, ſign'd 1508. by the Regiſter <hi>T.

               <p>AT what Time the Collar of SS<hi>'s</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> is not fully determin'd, but it will appear at leaſt Three Hundred Years ſince, and worn as an Ornament for Women, as well as Men; for on a Monument in the Collegiate Church of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Figure of <hi>Margaret,</hi> Wife to Sir <hi>William Peito</hi> (ſaid to be interr'd <hi>Temp.

               <p>BY the laſt Article of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's.

               <p>IT appears by a Letter of Sir <hi>Richard</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> Kt. <hi>Clarencieux,</hi> dated <hi>July</hi> 10th, 1627. that the blue Ribband had ſome Years before been additional to the Ornament of the Order; and 'tis reported, that <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> obſerving in <hi>France</hi> the Jewels of the Order of St. <hi>Michael</hi> and St. <hi>Eſprit</hi> worn in blue Ribbands, upon his return was the principal motive thoſe Ribbands whereat the <hi>George</hi> hung, were exchanged into that Colour. And in a Picture of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> drawn towards the Declenſion of her Reign, her leſſer George is repreſented hanging before her Breaſt in a blue Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

               <p>FOR, Firſt it is ordained, That the Knights-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſhould be Arrayed in the whole Habit on the Eve of St. <hi>George,</hi> before the Sovereign proceeded to the Chapter to hear Divine Service, and being ſo Robed, ſhould attend on the Sovereign to the Chapter-Houſe, thence to the Chapel, and return with him back in the ſame manner, until after Supper, as well thoſe that minded to Sup, as thoſe that ſhould not Sup; nor might they diſrobe, until the Sovereign or his Deputy had put off his, or declar'd it ſeaſonable for his or their doing ſo.</p>
               <p>BY the ſame Statute they were enjoined to wear the whole Habit on the Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> both at their Progreſſion in the Morning to the Chapter-Houſe or Chapel, at their return to Dinner from thence to the Second Veſpers, and back to Supper, as alſo till Supper was over, and until the Sovereign or his Lieutenant took leave of the reſt of the Knights-Companions.</p>

The time of wearing the whole Habit in this Point extends but to the End of the ſecond Veſpers, as in the ſecond Inſtance above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> THE Knights-Companions are to wear the entire Habit at the Feaſts of Inſtallation when they aſſiſt at that Ceremony; where, if it commence in the Evening, they are not to diſrobe themſelves till after Supper; and being the next Morning habited as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then to proceed to the Chapter-Houſe or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and not to deveſt themſelves till Dinner is ended.</p>
               <p>THE leſs ſolemn Occaſions are thoſe, which require the wearing the Mantle or Collar of the Order only.</p>
               <p>AND they are firſt, upon the Morrow after the Grand Feaſt-Day, when the Sovereign and Knights-Companions proceed to the Chapel, and make their Offering; then it ſufficeth, that they barely put on the Mantle, which, Service being Finiſhed, they were wont to leave it at the Chapter-Houſe-Door as they retired out of the Chapel.</p>

               <p>THESE Mantles thus ordered to be repoſed in the College upon emergent Occaſions, were anciently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Cuſtody of the Black-Rod, as granted by Letters Patent with the Office 1 <hi>H.</hi> 5.

Inveſtiture, as appears in the Caſe of <hi>Henry Stafford,</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire, Ann.</hi> 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. And at a Chapter held <hi>May</hi> 22d. 1622.

               <p>Howbeit, the Cuſtom is otherwiſe as to wearing the Garter, the principal Enſign of the Order; for tho' it be injoyned to be wore at the grand Feſtivals, &amp;c. yet it does not imply that it might be left off: For indeed it ought daily to be worn both by the Sovereign and Knights Companions.

               <p>FOR upon Reformation of the Order by that King, his Statutes wholly excluded the Eccleſiaſticks, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the Chancellors-Office ſhould be executed by a Knight qualified, with Honour and Reputation to manage a Poſt of that Care and Fidelity; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon appointed Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> Chancellor; And here firſt entred a ſecular Perſon, notwithſtanding which in a Charter to the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> 4 <hi>Eliz.</hi> (containing the Charters of Queen <hi>Mary, H.</hi> VIII. and

The firſt of theſe Biſhops who concerned himſelf for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering this high Station to that See, was Biſhop <hi>Cotton,</hi> who upon the Death of Sir <hi>Edward Dyer,</hi> ſometime Chancellor, Petitioned the Sovereign, 6. <hi>Jac.</hi> I. and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reſtitution thereof to the Church of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any determination, the two chief Juſtices, and chief Baron was adviſed withal, who were of Opinion, that this Office was not compleatly or ſufficiently annexed to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Salisbury</hi> by King <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. But <hi>Cook</hi> in his Inſtitutes, reports the point Void, upon the incertainty of the Grant, for that a new Office was Erected, and not defined what Juriſdiction or Authority the Officer ſhould Exerciſe; and there's aſſigned a third Reaſon, That the Grant was in the Sovereign's diſpoſal, becauſe the Patent was obtained without Fee; with one or more of theſe Opinions, the Sovereign's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ſwayed, He forthwith nominated Sir <hi>John Herbert,</hi> one of His privy Council to the Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo this affair remained Silent, until <hi>Anno</hi> 12. <hi>Car.</hi> I. when <hi>John Davenant,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> upon Sir <hi>Francis C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anes</hi> deceaſe, remonſtrated to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign his Claim to this Office, whereupon at a Chapter held at <hi>Windſor,</hi> 5th of <hi>Dec.</hi> that Year, the Sovereign propos'd to the Knights-Companions preſent, that tho' he had made Election of Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe</hi> for his Chancellor that time, yet underſtanding a Claim made by the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that the Place was annexed to that See, he commanded the Lords-Companions to take the pretence of right into their conſiderations; to which propoſition of the King's, they anſwered that they thought it not their duty to ſearch for the Title of any Perſon, but that if the Biſhop did produce his Evidence and Proofs, he might preſent it in Chapter to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>UPON this Encouragement, the Biſhop preſented a Petition, which was read in the Chapter at <hi>Windſor,</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0739200500:210"/>
the 18th of <hi>April</hi> enſuing, to this effect, That King <hi>Edw.</hi> IV, by Letters Patent, had Erected this Office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and did then grant the ſame to <hi>Richard Beauchamp,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and his Succeſſors for ever, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that the Chapel of St. <hi>George</hi> was within their Dioceſs; that thoſe Biſhops had enjoyed the ſame, according to the Charter, which Charter had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> by ſome other Kings and Queens, and laſtly by the King himſelf. But that the uſe and exerciſe of that Office had for many Years been diſcontinued from them, praying therefore an Hearing, and Examination, that the right of the ſaid Church might be preſerved and reſtored. To the ſubſtance of which it was objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT the Great Seals of <hi>England</hi> did not work within, or upon the Statutes and Rules of the Order of the Garter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second,</hi> THAT no Grant could preſcribe the preſent Sovereign, it being a Law Fundamental within the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Suprema Lex</hi> was <hi>Suprema Voluntas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third,</hi> THAT it did not appear by the Records of the Order, that the Office of the Chancellor was any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conferred upon <hi>Richard Beauchamp,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> than <hi>quam diu Regiae celſitudini complaceret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO the <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was anſwered by way of Exception, as to the Grant of Offices, foraſmuch as the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> was took into, and became legal within the Order in like caſes; and not any Patent for an Office, had paſt under the Seal of the Order, but under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and in particular the Office of the Chancellor-ſhip, which had not been tranſacted, if any legal defect had been therein.</p>
               <p>TO the <hi>Second,</hi> granting it was ſo as was Objected, it appeared that the Sovereign was as much at liberty to reſtore this Office to the See of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> as continue it to ſecular Dignities.</p>
               <p>TO the <hi>Third,</hi> what was alledged out of the Records of the Order, related only to the time of delivering the Seals to Biſhop <hi>Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

R. VI. But the Sovereign thought it was not then well canvaſs'd and weighed, to permit the Chapter Acts of this Order, wholly independant from other Laws, to receive conſtruction and determination from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and therefore declared that the Biſhop ought to be heard; and to that purpoſe, gave him Orders to prepare the Vouchers and Proofs of his pretenſions in vindication of his Petition, and to ſend them to be delivered to the Knights-Commiſſioners, elected for the affairs of the Order, for their conſideration at the next Chapter, which was accordingly put in execution, and then refierred to them again to be conſidered, prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abbreviated, to be peruſed by the Sovereign, for his final determination. But the <hi>Scotch</hi> War ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breaking forth, and troubles running high at Home, the further Proſecution was laid aſide, and not revived until the 19th of <hi>Nov. Anno</hi> 21. <hi>Car.</hi> II. When <hi>Seth Ward,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> took encouragement upon the former grounds, and the Sovereign's favour, to ſet on foot this Claim, by a Petition preſented to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then held at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where, after a full debate and mature deliberation had of its equity and juſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he obtained a Decree for Re-eſtabliſhment of this Office on the Biſhops of that See, upon the firſt vacancy, Dated the 19th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1669. and preſent his Majeſty the Sovereign, the Dukes of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Earls of <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>

As to his Robe, it was at firſt the ſame with the Prelates, both for Cloth and Colour, but his proportion of Cloth far leſs, having allowed him but 5 Yards, when the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late had 24, nor but 3 Timber of Minever groſs, where the Prelate had 19, beſide a large quantity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Furs; nor was the Colour confined to one kind, until the conſtitutions of this Office appointed it to be

Crimſon, as was the Prelates, for no doubt it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore annually changed, as his was to the Colour of the Knights-Companions Surcoats; however by the Picture of the ancient Habits of the Officers, it is conſpicuous, it was debared the Royal Badges, wherewith the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Roſe was Embroidred; when the Colour of the Prelates Robe was changed to Murray, the Chancellors had the ſame Alteration and was Trim'd alike in all other particulars. The proportion allowed to Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> for his Livery, <hi>Anno</hi> 14. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was 18 Yards of Murray Velvet, 12 Yards of Sarcenet for the Lining, one Garter wrought with Pearls of Damask Gold for the Shoulder, one Lace (or Cordon) with But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, and Taſſels of blue Silk and <hi>Venice</hi> Gold, and the ſame Materials and Quantities were afterwards diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted out of the Sovereigns great Wardrobe, to the ſucceeding Chancellors.</p>

                  <p>BESIDES this Robe, the Chancellor of the Order hath an honourable Badge of Diſtinction aſſigned him to wear, firſt granted to Sir <hi>William Peters</hi> and his Succeſſors, the 9th of <hi>October,</hi> 1 and 2 <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>Mar. viz.</hi> a golden Roſe encloſed within a Garter, which he and his Succeſſors, Chancellors of the Order, have ever ſince worn daily about their Necks; at firſt it was Pendant in a Gold-Chain, but ſince in a Purple Ribband.

                  <p>THE aforeſaid Conſtitutions provide the Chancellor of the Order an Habitation within the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor,</hi> as well as the Prelate, which is the South-Weſt Tower in the lower Ward of the Caſtle, call'd the <hi>Chancellor's Tower.</hi> The Poſſeſſion thereof had been for ſome time in the Power of others; and therefore by a Chapter convened at <hi>White-hall, Nov.</hi> 5th, 5 <hi>Car.</hi> I. it was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto Sir <hi>Francis Crane,</hi> then Chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AT the firſt Erection of this Office, the Chancellor had no Penſion awarded him, until the Conſtitutions in reference to the Officers were Eſtabliſhed. At that time there was conferr'd on him a Penſion of 100<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in conſideration of his Employment, or elſe an allowance proportionate in Fees, Offices or other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, over and above his Lodgings in the Caſtle, and Liveries at Court. But as to Fees and Perquiſites, there are none to be Claimed by this Officer; and for that Reaſon, he not only poſſeſſes the ſaid Penſion, but all his disburſements allowed him, even to Paper, Wax, and Wafers; and indeed thoſe who enjoyed the Office eſteem'd it as a degradation of their Poſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive either fee, or gratuity for any affair Tranſacted within the Order; and Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe,</hi> ſometime Chancellor, affirmed <hi>That his Office was an Office of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and not of Fees, and that he had always excepted againſt Fees, for the disburſement of the Sovereign's Money:</hi> Tho' he acknowledged ſome had beſtowed on his Clerk a ſmall gratuity, for the bare Ingroſſing of an Alms Knights Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but nothing farther.</p>
                  <p>AND becauſe the Cuſtody of the Seals of the Order, appertains to this Officer; it will be here the fitteſt Place to mention ſomething of them. By the Statutes of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. they were to have a Common Seal. This is confirmed by the Statutes of King <hi>Hen.</hi> V. and ſince named the Great Seal of the Order. The uſe of this is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0739200500:215"/>
not only to Seal the Original Statutes, appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main perpetually within the Treaſury of <hi>Windſor</hi> College, as alſo thoſe Copies of which each Knight-Companion is obliged to conſerve one, but likewiſe all Letters of Licence to any of the Knights-Companions deſirous of winning Honour abroad, and all Mandates and Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, relating to the Order.</p>
                  <p>AFTER what Model the firſt Seal was compos'd, we have no exact Relation. <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> tells us, That when the Founder of the Order had fixed Choice of St. <hi>George</hi> for its Patron, he repreſented him Armed, and Mounted on an Horſe, bearing a Silver Shield, and thereon a Red Croſs, but whether St. <hi>George</hi> thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, was on the firſt Seal, or only a Scutcheon of his Arms, as in latter times, is uncertain. But his Author obſerves that the Founder Habited his Soldiers in white Jackets or Coats, and on their Breaſts and Backs ſowed Red Croſſes, parallel to the Arms aſſigned to St. <hi>George,</hi> as well as to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> put under his Patronage, which Arms the Sovereigns of the Order, have ever ſince exhibied in their Standards. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this Common Seal King <hi>Hen.</hi> V. in the 9th Year of his Reign, Inſtituted a privy Signet, in caſe the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſhould be called out of this Kingdom upon weighty Affairs. The intent thereof was to affix it to all Acts paſſed by the Sovereign beyond Sea, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe of his Deputies in <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII's Statutes, Ordain the making both of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seal and Signet, and direct that the Arms of the Order ſhould be Engraven upon each of them. The Common Seal uſed in his Reign was a Garter, within it a Shield having the Croſs of St. <hi>George,</hi> impaling the National Arms, the ſaid Shield encompaſſed with two Branches hanging from the Regal Crown, which debruſes part of the Garter; the Signet being deſigned after the ſame manner, but leſs: <hi>Temp. Jac.</hi> I. it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no other alteration, but only in the National Arms, by admitting the Quarterings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and new-faſhioning the Crown, omitting the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the Shield.</p>
                  <p>THERE was a Seal made at the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Cha.</hi> I. which being eſteemed too little for the Grandure and Honour of the Sovereigns Commiſſions,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0739200500:216"/>
it was afterwards Decreed in Chapter, held 18th of <hi>April.</hi> 13. Car. I. <hi>That a new one ſhould be made of a larger Size, with the accuſtomed Arms and Motto, and the care thereof commited to Sir</hi> Thomas Rowe, <hi>Chancellor;</hi> which Command he Executed with all due care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as is manifeſtly evident by the nobleneſs of the deſign: One Repreſentation being St. <hi>George,</hi> in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, adorned with a waveing Mantle, his Bever open, his Helmet plumed, holding a Shield of his Arms in his left Hand, and ſtriking with a Sword in his right, his Body mounted on a bold Horſe, Trampling over a Dragon, which Aſſails the Champion, the whole Figure is well contracted, and the Sun, a Rock, the Bones of devoured Men, and a Mountain in <hi>Lointon,</hi> in it is Circumſcribed, <hi>Magnum ſigillum Nobilis Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis Garterij;</hi> having the enrichments of feſtons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween every Word placed pentagonally: The other Repreſentation, is the Royal Garter imperially Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, encloſing a Shield of the Arms of St. <hi>George,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paling the Sovereign's Arms, the ſame Bordered with Fret-work, and other Ornaments in Cartouche. In the ſame decree, direction was given alſo for a new Signet, the former being thought too big for Letters, and this was an Oval ſhaped ſo from its Impreſſion, which was the Garter Crowned, wherein was St. <hi>George,</hi> and the Sovereigns Arms impaled.</p>
                  <p>IT was at the ſame Chapter further 'decreed; <q>That all Legations to deliver this Order to Foreign Princes, all other Acts, bearing the Stile of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, all Patents of Offices and Fees, all Grants or Licences ſent out of the Kingdom, ſhould be Sealed with this Seal, which ſhould be henceforward called the Great Seal of the Order; ſo alſo the Book of Statutes, ſent to Elect Knights or Foreign Princes, being fixed to a Label of Blue Silk, and held ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to antient Cuſtom; and that all Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Order, whether of ſignification of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Lieutenancy, or Summons upon prorogation, or other Directions from the Sovereign, ſhould only be Sealed with the Signet: Moreover, theſe Seals were appointed to be thenceforth Born before the Sovereign in all Publick Aſſemblies, during the

               <p>§ 3. THE Regiſters Oath, Mantle, Badge, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Penſion, fall next under our conſideration; he was one of the three, Conſtituted at the Inſtitution of the Order, under the Title of <hi>Regiſtrator</hi> and <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrarius,</hi> and ſo is called in the Statutes of King <hi>Hen.</hi> V. elſewhere in the Books of the Order, <hi>Scriba</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarius.</hi> What were the firſt Regiſters, names we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover, till the Reign of King <hi>Hen.</hi> V. But it may be preſumed, they were Canons of <hi>Windſor;</hi> becauſe this Office was at firſt aſſigned to one of that College; beſides the Regiſters from the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. to the beginning of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIIIth Reign, were alſo Canons of this College, among
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0739200500:218"/>
whom was <hi>John Coningham,</hi> (and the firſt found called ſo) as the Fragments of a Glaſs Inſcription in <hi>Clare</hi> Church near <hi>Windſor,</hi> where he was Rector, atteſts. The firſt Dean of <hi>Windſor,</hi> Conſtituted Regiſter of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was <hi>John Veſey,</hi> Anno 8. <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. many of whoſe Succeſſors in this Deanry, have ſince been admitted; nevertheleſs, as they were Canons not Deans of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> and tis not improbable the Deans were Elected to this Office, as being enabled to ſupport the Reputation of the Regiſterſhip, with the Revenue of his Deanry, better than any of the Canons, with the addition of the Penſion. But at a Chapter held at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the 22d of <hi>April,</hi> 11 <hi>Car.</hi> I. The Sovereign thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the Office of Dean and Regiſter ſhould concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in one and the ſame Perſon, as formerly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded this his Pleaſuer to be Enrolled among the Annals of the Order, that ſo it might paſs in the future Times, from Example into Rule.</p>
               <p>BY the Conſtitutions of the Office, a ſecular Perſon is made capable of it, no leſs than an Eccleſiaſtick, how be it, <hi>He is to be a Man of ſingular integrity,</hi> eminent quality, a Knight, and ſignalized for Experience and Learning; but if an Eccleſiaſtick, then muſt he be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of conſummate Erudition, <hi>a profeſſor of Divinity or Law, either Canon, or Civil,</hi> and a Dignitarian in ſome Cathedral Church, or elſe a Canon at <hi>Windſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſubſtance of his Oath in the Statute of the Inſtitutions was, <hi>That he ſhould enter upon the Regiſtry, with all Fidelity, the Scrutinies, Elections, Penalties, Reconciliations, and all other Acts relating to the Order,</hi> to which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he ſhall faithfully Diſcharge his Duty in all things. But in King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIIIth Days, the Oath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him, differs nothing from that of the Prelates and Chancellors.</p>
               <p>AT his Admiſſion, he takes this Oath Kneeling, while the Prelate uſed to pronounce the Words as <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. and 6. <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> but in his abſence, as <hi>Anno</hi> 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Chancellor adminiſtred it. <hi>Anno</hi> 4. <hi>Car.</hi> I. the Prelate, Chancellor, and Regiſter, took their Oaths at one time, and then it was thus Ordered; firſt the Regiſter took it Kneeling between the Sovereign's Knees, the Black Rod holding the Evangeliſts, and the <hi>Garter</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0739200500:219"/>
read the Words out of the black Book; this done, the Regiſter read the Words of the Prelates Oath, when he was Sworn; and in the laſt place, did the like to the Chancellor; after this manner did Garter read the Words to the Regiſters, admitted 11 <hi>Car.</hi> I. and 12 <hi>Car.</hi> II. We cannot trace the Habit this Officer had aſſigned him at the Erection of the Order; but it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appears, that his Allowance was the ſame with the Chancellors, conſiſting of 5 Yards of Woollen Cloth, and 3 Timber of Minever groſs, equalent to what thoſe Knights-Companions had allotted, who were under the degree of an Earl: The Habit he is pourtrayed in, at a proceeding of King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIIIth Reign, ſhews it to be Eccleſiaſtical, a black Gown, a Surplice over that, reaching to his Ancles, and thereon a Mantle of Furs; but the Conſtitutions of his Office reſtricted him to none, wherein there ſeems a defect, ſince they have aſſignd Habits to the Garter, and black Rod. Notwithſtanding by a Draught of the Officers in their ancient Dreſs, it is plainly demonſtrable to be a Mantle, ſomewhat of a Ruſſel colour, Faced with a Pane of blue, whereon is Embroidred a Flower-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce Crowned Gold, then another Pane red, thereon a Lyon Paſſant gardant Crowned Gold, and ſo they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately placed to the bottom; to this Mantle belong Cordons of Silk, blue and yellow.</p>
               <p>SINCE that time, not only the Regiſters, but alſo Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Black Rods, Robes, underwent ſome Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for by a Decree in Chapter, called at St. <hi>James, Jun.</hi> 1. 4 and 5. <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> theſe Officers were aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mantles of crimſon Satin, Lined with Taffaty, and a Scutcheon of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Arms, Embroidred on the left Shoulder, but not encircled with a Garter, having the ſame Buttons and Taſſels as wereappointed to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and Chancellor; the proportion of Satin aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each Mantle, was 14 Yards, and as many Yards of white Taffaty.</p>
               <p>AND tho' the Regiſters Mantle was <hi>Ann.</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the preceeding Materials, and had like Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, yet they agree not in their Proportions, here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed 18 Yards of crimſon Satin, and but 12 of Taffaty; from hence theſe Mantles continued immutable
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0739200500:220"/>
until the 20th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> II. when there Iſſued a Warrant to the Maſter of the great Wardrobe, to prepare for this Officer, as alſo for Garter, and the Black Rod, for their Liveries Mantles of ſcarlet Satin, each containing 18, and 10 Yards of white Taffaty for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but conſonant in all other Punctilio's with the former; yet why the colour was altered, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>THE Regiſter ſeems to have been repreſented with a Scrowle in his Hand, for his Badge, and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, Pictured with a Book, both proper Symbols of his Office. In Dr. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Wren</hi>'s Regiſterſhip, the Sovereign Commanded him to cover the red Book of the Order with crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Velvet, and aſſigned for the Garter, two Pens in Saltire, interlacing the Garter above with theſe two Letters <hi>C R</hi> Crowned, all being richly Embroidred, (as alſo the Border) with <hi>Venice</hi> Gold and Silver, and various colours of <hi>Naples</hi> Silk, by <hi>Harriſon</hi> the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's Embroiderer, with a Claſp, in Imitation of the Garter, ſurrounding the Repreſentation of St. <hi>George,</hi> which coſt 12 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> This Book he was Ordered to bear before his Breaſt, on all Solemn Occaſions when he wore his Mantle, and for his better Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he made a Belt and an Ouch to hang it by.</p>
               <p>So high a Regard had the Sovereigns of this Order, not only to this Officer, but likewiſe to Garter and Black Rod, that they took them into a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and by the Conſtitutions of their Offices granted them, <q>That they, their Goods and Servants ſhould ſeverally remain under the Safe-guard of the Sovereign; and if any Injury or Violence ſhould chance to be offered them either by Subjects or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, whenſoever they ſhould exhibit their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to the Sovereign, either himſelf or the Knights-Companions ſhould afford them Juſtice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

UPON the ſtrength and Security of this ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, to avoid the prolongation of a Law Suit, Dr. <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> Regiſter, Petitioned the Sovereign in Chapter, held at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the 19th of <hi>April,</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> I. againſt one <hi>Thornhill,</hi> who under Pretence of Digging for Salt-Peter, had ſo Undermined his Pigeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, Built on the Rectory of <hi>Kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>IN a Chapter held at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>the 13th of</hi> February, <hi>6</hi> Car. <hi>I.

THIS was carried upon the Petition of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-Uſhers, Daily-waiters, ſeconded by the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, the Earl-Marſhal; and others, Knights-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; as is evident from another Petition of theirs to the Sovereign in Chapter, aſſembled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the 17th of <hi>January,</hi> 20 <hi>Car.</hi> I. But ſome Years after this, 1642. the Lord <hi>Lanrick,</hi> Secretary for <hi>Scotland,</hi> had on Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi>'s behalf, obtained the Sovereign's Warrant for Letters-Patent under the Great-Seal, for two Lives, <hi>Maxwell</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Alexander Thayn,</hi> the longeſt Liver of them; whereby the ſaid Decree was fruſtrate to the Gentlemen-Uſhers; of which making Complaint in the laſt mentioned Chapter, the Sovereign and Knights-Companions (in regard this latter Grant was not only repugnant to the preceding Decree, and the Great-Seal ſurreptitiouſly gained, but ought likewiſe to have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Seals of the Order) order'd <hi>Peter Newton,</hi> Eſq; to be preſently ſworn into this Office. Nevertheleſs, after the Reſtoration, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1660. <hi>Newton</hi> being then dead, the Gentlemen-Uſhers, Daily-waiters, Petition'd again, and <hi>Thayne</hi> was demanded to put in his Anſwer; and the reſult of the whole was, after mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in a Chapter held at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the 20th of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 13 <hi>Car</hi> II. the Decree which fix'd this Office to one of the Gentlemen-Uſhers Daily-waiters, was confirmed, and <hi>John Ayton,</hi> one of the Petitioners, was ſworn Gentleman-Uſher of the Black-Rod, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Regiſter in the Preſence of the Sovereign, the Chapter ſitting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE Form of the Oath given to this Officer,</hi> temp. Hen. <hi>VIII. was,</hi> Truly and Faithfully to obſerve and keep all the Points of the Statutes of the Order as to him belonged and appertained.</p>
               <p>HE hath the like Habit with the Regiſter and Garter before deſcribed, but his Enſign and Badge is ſomewhat different from Garter's; for firſt, it was ordained, <hi>That he or his Deputy ſhould carry a Black-Rod</hi> (whence he hath his Title) <hi>before the Sovereign, or his Deputy, at the Feaſt of St.</hi> George, <hi>within the Caſtle of</hi> Windſor, <hi>and at other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities and Chapters of the Order.</hi> On the Top of which there ought to be ſet a Lyon of <hi>England.</hi> This Rod ſerves inſtead of a Mace, and has the ſame Authority to

apprehend Delinquents, and ſuch have offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Statutes of this Moſt Noble Order. And where he apprehends any one of the Order, as Guilty of ſome Crime for which he is to be expell'd the Order, the manner of it is by touching them with this Black-Rod, and his Fee for it, is 5 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE has aſſigned him a Golden Badge to be openly worn in a Gold Chain, or Ribband, before his Breaſt, compoſed of one of the Knots in the Collar of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which tye the Roſes together, and encompaſſed with a Garter, being alike on both ſides; which was conferred on him and his Succeſſors, by Decree in Chapter, held the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS as ancient as <hi>Hen.</hi> Vth's Reign, for there's a Houſe in <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle granted to this Officer by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-Patent, during Life. And the ſame Proviſion is made for him by the Conſtitutions of his Office. It is ſituate on the South-ſide of the Caſtle in the middle Ward. The ſaid Conſtitutions give him Baron-Service at Court, and Livery thereto appertaining; and beſides theſe, the keeping of the ſaid Caſtle, and the two Parks adjacent.</p>
               <p>KING <hi>Charles</hi> I. having taken into his Hands the little Park of <hi>Windſor,</hi> and beſtow'd it upon <hi>James Maxwell,</hi> then Uſher of the Black-Rod, He, at a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter held at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the 5th of <hi>November,</hi> 1629. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, That as the Cuſtody of the ſaid Park was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd on <hi>Maxwell</hi> in right of his Office; ſo the ſame ſhould for ever after be annex'd thereto, and not to be diſpoſed of but under the Great Seal of the Order, and that only to the Uſher of the Order for the time being.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, this Officer had anciently a Fee of 12 <hi>d. per diem,</hi> which we find continu'd down in the Letters-Patents, whereby this Office was granted. Beſides which, the Conſtitutions of his Office allow him an annual Penſion of 30 <hi>l.</hi> heretofore paid him out of the Exchequer, but by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. aſſigned him out of 1200 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> ſettled upon the Order; touching which, and the Payment of the Officers Penſions upon the new Eſtabliſhment, is the next Section.</p>

               </p>
               <p>AS to the Alms-Knights Patents, this Decree was of Force and Validity, but in the other Generals, how far it was purſu'd we know not; for in ſome of them it grew obſolete and uſeleſs. But in a Chapter called at <hi>Windſor,</hi> the 22d of <hi>April,</hi> 10 <hi>Car.</hi> I. a Debate aroſe about ſetting a Part of the Annual Summ of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of his Majeſty's Exchequer, to be employ'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in diſcharge of Expences towards the Feaſts of the Order, Legations to Foreign Princes, Payment of the Officers Penſions, &amp;c. diſburſed for the Neceſſity and Reputation of this Noble Order. Afterwards at a

Chapter held the 18th of <hi>April,</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> I. that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ratify'd his Royal Aſſignation, and increaſed his Bounty to 1200 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> ſetling it for thoſe deſigns in a Perpetuity for ever, and making it payable out of the Cuſtoms in the Port of <hi>London,</hi> but to be received by the Chancellor of the Order for the time being, as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of this Money, of which he was to give up an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Sovereign and Knights-Companions yearly at St. <hi>George</hi>'s Feaſt. And in purſuance of this Ratification, the Attorney-General had Inſtructions to draw up a Book for his Royal Signature to Warrant its paſſing under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> which was diſpatch'd, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-Patent bearing <hi>teſte</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 23d of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> I.

THE Executions of theſe Offices is the laſt thing here to be deſcribed: For tho' all the Officers are ſtrictly obliged to give perſonal Attendance to their Offices; yet, in caſe of Sickneſs, Abſence out of the Kingdom, or other emergent Reaſons, the Sovereign is pleaſed to diſpence with them, and conſtitute others to Officiate in their ſtead, who on ſuch Occaſions wear the Robe of that Officer whom they repreſent, ſo in caſe of Vacancy, the Abſence of the Prelate at the Grand Feaſt celebrated at <hi>Windſor,</hi> 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. is noted in the <hi>Black Book</hi> to have been upon juſt Cauſe, and the Biſhop of <hi>Bangor</hi> officiated Divine Service, and next Morning ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the Maſs <hi>pro defunctis.</hi> The following Year, his Place in theſe religious Duties was ſupply'd by the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> as <hi>Ann.</hi> 36 and 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. and at all times of the Prelates abſence, the Sovereign hath made known his Will what Biſhop ſhould ſupply for him.

is taken of the Limitation given by the Statutes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Certificate of Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Six Weeks, within the Space whereof a new Election was to commence; yet where a Chapter for Election could not conveniently be ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within that limited Time, it was ſufficient if the Soveraign declared as he did in the ſaid Placart and entered in the Black Book, <hi>That being then involved in other Buſineſs, he could not well attend this Affair, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deferr'd the time for Election, unto the Eve of St.</hi> George <hi>next following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of later Date, this formal Way of Summons by Letter, hath been diſcontinued, and only remained to ſuch as are remote, and warned only by a verbal Meſſage. For the Chancellor of the Order having conſulted the Soveraign's Pleaſure, as to the Day and Place, uſually acquaints Garter therewith, who thereupon goes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Knights Companions then at Court, and deſires their Attendance at the Chapter, according to the Soveraign's Deſignation.</p>
               <p>And here it is to be remarked, that no Knight Elect ought to be ſummoned to a Chapter of Election, or are rendered ſufficient of giving their Votes therein, until they be compleatly inſtalled, either in Perſon, or by Proxy. Nor indeed did any Neceſſity intervene, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it till the late rebellious times, when the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor</hi> being Garriſon'd by the Parliament's Forces, it was not poſſible for the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> to take Poſſeſſion of their Stalls, as the Law of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enjoined.

               <p>IN the Firſt of theſe Inſtances, the <hi>Blue Book</hi> of the Order recordeth, That at a Chapter held immediately before Veſpers on St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day, the Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> then Lieutenant for the Sovereign, made known to the Knights-Companions, <hi>That the Sovereign did permit them, or leave it to their Pleaſure to chuſe into the Order whatſoever Foreign Prince they ſhould by their Votes approve of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HERE we have two Points that offer themſelves to our Conſideration. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Knights-Companions have not the Liberty to nominate what Foreign Prince they pleaſe, but the ſame is derivative from the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and only by his Permiſſion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To weigh the Paragraph well, that <hi>Nominare</hi> ought to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd or underſtood here by the Word <hi>Eligere,</hi> and that the Power delegated to the Knights-Companions from the Sovereign, was only to nominate, not elect; For it immediately follows, <hi>That the Knights-Companions went from the Chapter to the Second Veſpers; and while the Divine Offices were celebrating, the Prelate receiv'd their Nominations, and that very Evening the Lieutenant preſented them to the Sovereign for her to conſider of;</hi> which had been inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and uſeleſs, if the Knights-Companions had been impower'd by her Licence to have made the Choice themſelves. But the contrary is evident; for the next Morning, all the Knights-Companions attending the Sovereign in Chapter, ſhe herſelf confirm'd there the Election not of any Foreign Prince, but of the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Buckhurſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the other Inſtance, <hi>Anno</hi> 3 <hi>Car.</hi> I. the Sovereign in a Chapter held before Veſpers on St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd it to be his Pleaſure (Three Stalls being then vacant) that <hi>out of Foreign Princes, the Nomination of whom,</hi> (ſaith the Annals in that very Place) <hi>belongs only to the</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth they, the Knights-Companions, ſhould pitch upon; which muſt undoubtedly be underſtood to Nominate, or enter down into the Scrutiny, (not elect) <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> For a little after, it is evident, when the Scrutiny was preſented to the Sovereign, that himſelf, not the Knights-Companions, made Election of them.</p>
               <p>AND it is further manifeſt, by the Scrutiny there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that both thoſe Princes were named by every of the Knights-Companions then preſent, according to the Sovereign's ſignification (which has been uſually done at all other Times upon the like Occaſions.) But concerning the third Perſon then to be Elected, the Sovereign, (intending him to be a Knight-Subject) left it entirely to their Pleaſure to Nominate whomſoever they thought worthy of their Votes. Since this Time, the Nominations in like Caſes, have been ſufficiently acknowledg'd by the Knights-Companions themſelves, to be a Prerogative belonging ſolely to the Sovereign. For to the End they might more expeditiouſly and clearly ſhew their Compliance, it was moved in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter held at <hi>Oxford, March</hi> the 2d. 19 <hi>Car.</hi> I. <hi>That it might become a Cuſtom for the Sovereign to declare before-hand, whether he would<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and three Knights. Wherein the Things chiefly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, we rank under five Heads.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt of theſe, their Number. Every Knight-Companion aſſembl'd in Chapter, is injoin'd to name Nine, neither more nor leſs. So alſo faith King <hi>Henry</hi> V's Statutes. Nor are King <hi>Henry</hi> VIIIth's. any ways diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And in this particular, the Statutes have been hitherto inviolably obſerved, except in one Caſe. As to Numbers, and the Myſteries wrapt up in them, we ſhall not further inſiſt upon. But why our Royal Founder ſelected this particular Number above all other, unleſs he had ſome Eye, and tacit Reflection on the Nine Worthies, or a treble threefold Cord and Symbol of perfect Stability and ſolid Amity, the Number Nine is accounted to ſignifie, can with no great Facility or Certainty be decypher'd.</p>
               <p>As to the Second Point, they ought to be of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Character. The Injunction in the Statutes of Inſtitution takes Order, that the Perſons deſigned for Election, ſhould be <hi>free from all Reproach, and of untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Reputation;</hi> and according to thoſe of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. are to be <hi>the beſt and moſt ſufficient Knights, and freeſt from Reproach.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe the Exemplar in the Black-Book, <hi>Such as are fitteſt,</hi> and whom they who Nominate <hi>believe to be free from Ignominy and Diſhonour.</hi> And to this Act of Nomination belongs part of the Second Article in <hi>Henry</hi> VIIIth's Statutes, <hi>That no Knight-Companion ſhould name any Perſon whom he thinks or eſteems in his Conſcience to have upon him any Spot of Reproach.</hi> But on the Contrary in another Place of the ſame Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes it is Provided, That they be nominated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>out of the Number of the moſt worthy and ſelect Knights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How tender the Knights-Companions were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Times of infringing this particular, is proved from a notable Paſſage which happen'd <hi>Ann.</hi> 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. at a Scrutiny taken the 8th of <hi>February,</hi> in the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Palace, where <hi>John de Foix</hi> Earl of <hi>Kendal,</hi> a <hi>Gaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

amongſt us ſo well and demonſtrably as to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſuch whom he was confident were irreprehenſible, forbore to mention any Perſons at all. And certainly, ſeeing the Statutes put very conſiderable Qualifications upon the Deputies and Proxies, made choice for the Inſtallation of Strangers (as elſewhere ſhown) much more C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ution and Regard ought to be uſed both in the Nomination and Election of Knights into this radiant and illuſtrious Society.</p>
               <p>THE third Head the Statutes render indifferently capable of being nominated or elected, either Knights Subjects, or Strangers, [Free Princes or their Subjects.] And it was ſo even at the Election upon the firſt Choice, where among the Twenty five E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ected Knights, Twenty three of them were Subjects. And this was the conſtant Cuſtom not only in the remaining Part of the Founders Reign, and during thoſe of his three Succeſſors, but has continued ever ſince, as appears from the Scrutinies taken and entred throughout the Annals of the Order.</p>
               <p>OF thoſe who have gain'd admiſſion into this Noble Order by Election, we ſhall in the laſt Chapter give an Account in a compleat Catalogue of them, and likewiſe inſert the Names of ſuch as have miſſed their Election, yet are not to be buried in Oblivion, out of this very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that by their ſtanding Candidates, have the Fame of being enrolled in the Principal Regiſter of Honour now in the Chriſtian World. It cannot be ſuppoſed we ſhould give a Liſt of all, (for that were a Task too laborious, and wou'd prove too numerous) but only of thoſe of eminent Quality in foreign Parts, with the Aera when the Scrutinies were taken.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THIS Duty was executed by the Regiſter from the 15th Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to the Period of his and his Son's Reign, as the <hi>Black-Book</hi> of the Order fully evinces; as alſo on St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> by <hi>John Boxhall;</hi> and at the Feaſt of St. <hi>George</hi> held <hi>Ann.</hi> 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. by <hi>Giles Thompſon,</hi> who in the ſeveral Times were Regiſters, yet we muſt not miſtake that what they officiated was on their own behalf, but ſupply'd the Place of the Prelate.</p>
               <p>IN the Beginning of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, we find the Chancellor of the Order began to perform this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, being by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIIIth's Statutes adjoined to thoſe other Offices before deſcrib'd, to collect the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies in abſence of the Prelate, and thereby made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHEN a Deputy-Chancellor hath been admitted to Officiate in the Chancellor's abſence, he, and not the Prelate, hath taken the Scrutiny, (tho' preſent) as at the Election of <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the 20th of <hi>May,</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> I. and at another taken the 22d of <hi>May</hi> following, and the ſame when the Suffrages were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the Election of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at <hi>York, Anno</hi> 17 <hi>Car.</hi> I.</p>

               <p>AND to ſhew the probability of this Point, the Earls of <hi>Oxford, Devonſhire,</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> (whoſe degrees were ſufficiently known) at a Scrutiny taken <hi>Anno</hi> 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. are ranked in the ſecond Diviſion among the Barons, and <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> is three Times ſo placed, and again 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> twice; but this happened not thro overſight or neglect of the Statutes, but becauſe at theſe Nominations wherein they are ſo Ranked, the firſt Diviſion to which they appertained, happened to be fill'd up with thoſe other higher Dignities belonging to the ſame Claſs, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>ON the contrary, <hi>Anno</hi> 15 and 16 <hi>Eliz.</hi> IV. the Lord <hi>Rich.

               <p>WHEREIN the ſecond Diviſion are Ranked the Barons and Viſcounts, for Viſcounts in all Scrutinies, after the firſt Erection of that Dignity, were on the ſame level with the Barons, until the 3 of <hi>Jac.</hi> I. (excepting only <hi>John Dudley</hi> Viſcount <hi>Liſle, Anno</hi> 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. who by every Knight, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> excepted, is Ranked in the firſt Diviſion of Princes) and in a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny then taken, <hi>Robt. Cecil</hi> Viſcount <hi>Craneborne</hi> is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Viſcount in the Liſt that has been Ranked with Princes, whence it became the frequent Practice in ſucceeding Scrutinies, until <hi>Anno</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> I. And then (upon a Queſtion put in Chapter convened at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> 23 <hi>May</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> I.) whether Earls Sons and Viſcounts were eligible with Barons, it paſſed in the affirmative, and that by general uſage except in the two caſes juſt mentioned; and about the ſame time we find it reiterat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near that Time, for in two Scrutinies taken the 19th and 21ſt of that Inſtant <hi>May,</hi> the Viſcounts are therein reduced to the ſecond Diviſion, and Ranked with the Barons.</p>
               <p>THE Knights-Batchelors and Bannerets held the ſame

               <p>THE Knights-Companions, having delivered their Suffrages, the Officer by whom they are Collected, humbly preſents to the Sovereign the Nominations, for ſo it is recorded the Prelate of the Order acted in the 9th of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Vth. If theſe Votes were taken in Chapter, the Paper uſually was immediately preſented to the Sovereign who made his Election, before the Chapter broke up; but if gathered in the Chapel, tho' it was given to the Sovereign, yet the choice was not made then, but the Morning after, and this was the manner in the 2d and 5th Years of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time it hath not been preſented till the Veſpers were finiſhed, but in the Practice of latter Days the Scrutiny hath not been given up to the Sovereign till the next Day at the opening of the Chapel before Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Prayer, as in the 13, 15, 20, 30 Years of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> demonſtrates, and was the accuſtomed Practice of the 17th Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of ever ſacred Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; the laſt preſentation was tranſcribed in a little Book, and with all due Reverence offered upon the Knee, before any other Affair was tranſacted in the Chapter.</p>
               <p>THIS has been the general Uſe as we are aſcertain'd, <hi>Anno</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. the Dean of <hi>Windſor,</hi> and the Regiſter of the Order, having Collected the Vote of every Knight, they were immediately given into the Hands of the Sovereign's Deputy; and in the ſame nature were they preſented on the 4th <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. when <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> was Lieutenant, in the 20th of Queen <hi>Eliz.;</hi> when the Suffrages were Collected by Sir <hi>Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In the 12th Year of K. <hi>James</hi> I. ſome Exceptions aroſe upon the Chancellor's not preſenting the Scrutiny to the Prince, (who at that time was the Sovereign's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) but to the Sovereign himſelf, which was an Error he fell into, as well as ſome of his Predeceſſor's; as the 2d, 3d, and 25th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> demonſtrate.</p>

the Day before was read over in the Chapter-Houſe, the Sovereign declared, <hi>That he would receive no Man into the Order before his Son</hi> Charles.

This is the only Inſtance we have met with, where a Letter was ſent to an Elect Knight, and he at the ſame time preſent at Court; but when an Election is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Perſon remote from the Court, then the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tenure of the Letter is, both to ſignify his Election, and Summon him to his Inveſture, with the Garter and George, as was performed by the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Strafford,</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>Sometimes the Sovereign hath but performed part of the Inveſtiture, and laid his Commands on the ſenior Knight to do the reſt.

                     </gap>k</hi> gave him his Aſſiſtance, and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign put on the Gold Chain. At the Inveſtiture of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunſwick, Anno</hi> 22 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. the Sovereign put about his Neck the Blue Ribband, whereat hung the Effigies of St. <hi>George;</hi> and the Earls, who introduc'd him to the Sovereign's Preſence, buckled on the Garter. Thus did the Sovereign to <hi>William,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton, Anno</hi> 4 <hi>Car.</hi> I. and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> faſten'd the Garter about his left Leg.</p>
               <p>This Order of Inveſtiture began to be inverted <hi>Anno</hi> 22 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. the <hi>George</hi> and the Ribband being firſt put on, and the Garter laſt. And ſo was it performed when the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Monmouth, Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Albemarle,</hi> received their Inveſtiture in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. The Garter, as it was the firſt, ſo is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and moſt worthy Enſign of the Order; and, in the Practice of all former Times, had always the Preference given to it. The Inveſtiture with theſe two Enſigns, hath generally been performed by the two ſenior Knights, at the Command of the Sovereign; but always in his Preſence, the Chapter ſitting; but if abſent, then by his Lieutenant. For, in 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> being elected at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and coming to Court wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Affair, and after the Sovereign was riſen, (yet leaving the Chapter ſitting) her Lieutenant inveſted him both with the <hi>Garter</hi> and <hi>George.</hi> After the Solemnity is compleated, the elect Knight renders moſt humble Thanks to the Sovereign, and with due Reſpects ſalutes the Knights-Companions, who re-ſalute the elect Knight, and joyfully receive him into their Society. If two or more elect Knights receive this Inveſtiture at one time,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0739200500:290"/>
as ſoon as the Senior is inveſted, and his humble Thanks preſented, he moves downwards towards the Chapter-Houſe Door, and there ſtands till the next Junior Knight is inveſted; and if there be more, ſo on until the Chapter break up.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <p>§ 4. Where a Knight-Subject, at the time of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is far diſtant from Court, or beyond Sea, and the Sovereign determines to ſend him the Two principal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Order, the Charge of this Employ does of right belong to the <hi>Garter.</hi> For the Proof of which there are divers Precedents.</p>
               <p>The Letters heretofore ſent from the Sovereign, along with the Enſigns of the Order, to the elect Knights, have, for the moſt part, been drawn after the Form of thoſe that certify the Election, and differs only in the laſt Clauſe, which requires the elect Knight to repair to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: The difference lay not in the Body, but in the Direction of the Letter, which was always worded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Quality of the Perſon to whom it was ſent.

And the moſt remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſet down, <hi>Anno</hi> 3 and 4 <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> when the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Rocheſter,</hi> Knights elect, had their Inſtallation, together with the Feaſt of St. <hi>Georg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

were prorogued to the 5th of <hi>December,</hi> and ſtood ſo by ſeveral Prorogations, to the 20th of <hi>February</hi> next enſuing; yet it was ordered that the Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi> ſhou'd be immediately inſtalled, which was performed on the 8th of <hi>January,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> the 20th of <hi>April</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; but Sir <hi>Robert Rocheſter</hi> never obtained that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>Though the time of Inſtallation be arbitrary and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet hath the Place, from the firſt Inſtitution of the Order, been appointed only to the Sovereign's Free Chapel of St. <hi>George,</hi> within whoſe Choice are erected the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns and Knights-Companions Stalls, and under its ſacred Roof their Banners and Atchievements are affixed, as Monuments of their high Merit, and ſo great Honour. For though the Celebration of the Grand Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> happened to be removed from <hi>Windſor,</hi> by a Decree of the 1 <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> yet the Feaſt of the Inſtallation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and ordered to be Solemniz'd in that Place: For <hi>Anno</hi> 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. it was provided among the Orders, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(1.) A Commiſſion to admit and inſtal the elect Knight. (2.) Letters to each of the Commiſſioners, and the elect Knight, to repair to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> (3.) Warrants for the Sovereign's Livery. (4.) A Bill or Warrant for the removal of Stalls and Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all ſigned by the Chancellor of the Order, with the Sign Manual of the Sovereign: And laſtly, the Knights own Preparations; among which his Atchievements are to be ready to be hung up, as ſoon as he is inſtalled.</p>

               <p>Although it has been made apparent, that the <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> at their Election or Inſtallation, ſucceeded the immediate <hi>defunct Knight</hi> in his Stall, yet we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſometimes after Inſtallation, as an eſpecial ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Favour and Indulgence, the Sovereign hath been pleaſed, though very rarely, to advance a <hi>Knight-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion</hi> to a higher Stall than that wherein he was firſt placed; and though there be no ſuch Permiſſion granted by the Law of the Order, yet we find <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> removed from the ſeventh Stall on the Prince's ſide, to the Prince's Stall it ſelf, and it's ſaid to be done by the Decree of the Sovereign and the <hi>Knights-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi> And no doubt but as this was done by ſo good Authority, and ſo upon no leſs enducements to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and the whole Society. We ſhall here mention a few of theſe extraordinary Caſes. <hi>William Henalt,</hi> Earl of <hi>Oſtervant,</hi> was advanced by King <hi>Richard</hi> II. from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's ſide, to the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi>'s, being the ſecond on the Prince's ſide. <hi>Humphry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was removed from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's ſide, to the ſecond on the ſame ſide; and <hi>Richard Nevil,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> by the Conſent of the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> in Chapter, <hi>Anno</hi> 39 <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was tranſlated to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Stall; the Lord <hi>Bonvil,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Scales</hi>'s Seat; Sir <hi>Thomas Kyriell,</hi> to the Place of the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wenlock,</hi> to the Stall of Viſcount <hi>Beaumont.</hi> But King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. thinking it requiſite for the Sovereign of this moſt Noble Order, to be impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by a General, how to Act that at Pleaſure, which the former Sovereigns did not, but by the Power of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acts, or Orders, in the Chapter; after he had confirmed the ancient Law of ſucceeding in the Stall of the immediate Predeceſſor, and not to ſuffer an alteration without the Sovereign's Licence, in the next Article he eſtab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>of the Society into the void Stall, ſo that it were higher than that, wherein he ſate before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This in Effect did vacat the ancient Law of ſucceeding in Stalls, though at the ſame Time he ſeem'd to Confirm it to the <hi>Knights-Subjects,</hi> for afterwards Tranſlations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Inſtallations, became ſo frequent, that the Right an <hi>elect Knight</hi> had to his Predeceſſor's Stall, was ſeldom enjoyed.

               <p>Beſides the Power eſtabliſhed upon the Sovereigns of this moſt Noble Order, of tranſlating Stalls, when a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy happened, they farther added this larger Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: That the Sovereign, once in his Life, might, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But this Branch of the Sovereign's Prerogative, as far as we can find, was never put in Execution, though the Tranſlation, <hi>Anno</hi> 27 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. border'd ſomething u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is obſervable the ancient Law of ſucceeding in Stalls, in relation to them, was wholly altered.

And we muſt farther obſerve, that if the Inſtallation be appointed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nevertheleſs, there was a Queſtion moved 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. whether the uſage of wearing the Hood ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the left Shoulder, but it ſeems it was over-ruled; and 23 <hi>Car.</hi> II. ſome of the Knights-Companions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining it moſt proper to wear their Hoods on their left Shoulders, ran into that error, but upon better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the next Morning, altered them to the right. To Foreign Princes, there is liberty given by King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII's Statutes to receive, if they pleaſe, their Habit wholly within the Chapter-Houſe, before they enter their Stalls; by which it appears that this was the Cuſtom in times paſt; an inſtance whereof we have in <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile, Anno</hi> 22 <hi>Henry</hi> VII. who was entirely inveſted in the Chapter-Houſe with the Garter, Surcoat, Mantle, Hood, and Collar; the Sovereign himſelf putting his Hand to his Inveſtiture with the Mantle. Hence King <hi>Philip,</hi> Grandſon to the aforeſaid King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was inveſted with the whole Habit of the Order before he aſſumed the Stall; in <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>'s proceeding to the Chapel, he receiv'd his Inveſtiture within the Weſt Door, and there the Regiſter delivered the Mantle to the Earls of <hi>Derby</hi> and <hi>Pembrook,</hi> who kiſſing it, preſented it to the Queen, who, aſſiſted by the ſaid Earls, perſonally inveſted the King therewith: Next Garter gave the Collar to the

But as the aforeſaid Statute leaves this to the pleaſure of the Stranger Prince, and was permitted only for gaining Time, ſo none, who have receiv'd perſonal Inſtallation at <hi>Windſor</hi> ſince, have been fully inveſted before they entered the Choir.

               <head>Of ſetting up the Knight's Atchievements.</head>
               <p>§ 11. The laſt thing to be done at this great Solemnity, is ſetting up the <hi>Helm, Creſt, Sword, Banner,</hi> and <hi>Plate,</hi> of the new inſtalled Knight, over his Stall in the Chappel of St. <hi>George;</hi> to which purpoſe they are to be provided, according to the Directions before given.</p>
               <p>By the Statutes of Inſtitution it is ordained, that the time for ſetting up the Atchievements ſhall be when the elect Knight comes to <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> that is, to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallation, and not before; and the reaſon is there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe given, leſt it ſhould happen, he not coming for his Inſtallation within the time limitted, and conſequently the vacating his Election enſuing, that a new Election being made, thoſe military Enſigns might not ſeem to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully withdrawn, and an occaſion of Diſhonour given, which otherwiſe could not be avoided, if they ſhould be ſuddenly taken down from a Place ſo high; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, that the intention of this Article extends to the finiſhing the Ceremonies of Inſtallation, before the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements ought to be ſet up, by ſo carefully providing againſt the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Accordingly, in the ancient Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations both to Sir <hi>William Philip,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Falſtaff,</hi> Power is given their Proctors firſt to demand, receive, and obtain their principal Stalls, and next to tender their Helms, and Swords, to be hung up in the Choir of <hi>Windſor,</hi> according to Cuſtom: And for clearer Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the courſe of this Ceremony, that the Sovereign impowered his Commiſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Again, the Statutes expreſly provide, that the Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0739200500:361"/>
are no Fees due, nor can be claimed, till the Ceremonies on which they become due are entirely finiſhed. But to clear all Doubts which may ariſe upon this Point, it was at a Chapter held at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the fourth of <hi>February,</hi> 22 <hi>Car.</hi> II. ordained, <hi>That not any of the Atchievements of an elect Knight's Stall be ſet up in the Chappel at</hi> Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, <hi>before he be inſtalled, and the Fees of Inſtallation paid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though this was the Practice anciently, yet were the Atchievements always prepared and brought to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> and ſet before the elect Knight's Stall; and in caſe of his not coming to receive Inſtallation, then, being no otherwiſe placed, they might be the eaſier removed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Choir, in as decent manner as could be, ſo that the Honour of Knighthood might be preſerved entire; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, to be retained for publick Uſe, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the College.</p>
               <p>Where mention is made in the Annals of any Perſon employed to ſet up the Atchievements of a Knight, it is to be underſtood that he was his Proctor, and inſtalled on his behalf: And there appears but one ſingle Inſtance where one Perſon hath hung up a Knight's Atchievements, when another was inſtalled for him; and this happen'd 14th of <hi>Auguſt, Anno</hi> 29 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. where the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> having been elected to the Stall of the Lord <hi>Hungerford,</hi> his Sword and Helm were ſoon after (ſent) hung up by <hi>William Bobden,</hi> his Eſq; and <hi>Guyen Herald,</hi> and he inſtalled the 30 <hi>October</hi> following, by Sir <hi>William Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> his Proctor; but this was contrary to the Law of the Order.</p>

               <p>§ 1. IN regard that Strangers elect, are for the moſt part Sovereign Princes, whoſe Affairs obliged them to abide in their own Dominions, and very rarely permitted them to receive Perſonal Inſtallation, it was thought fit to allow them ſeveral Privileges, by the Founder of this moſt <hi>Noble Order,</hi> and principally, that of giving previous and timely Notice of their Elections, and convenient time of conſideration for Acceptance; aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was therefore by the <hi>Statutes</hi> ordained: That when any ſuch ſhould be choſen into the <hi>Order,</hi> they ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The right of bearing theſe Letters ſignifying Election, and returning the Strangers Anſwer, belongs to <hi>Garter,</hi> by the Conſtitutions of his Office. And though Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate of Election was to be made within f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> in the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. who having been elected 35 of that King, had not Letters ſent him to ſignify it till the next Year. It likewiſe appears, that Letters to the ſame Effect were then likewiſe diſpatched to the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had been elected eight Years before.</p>
               <p>And yet we find it recorded, that the <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> were ſent by ſpecial Ambaſſadors to all three, 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. two Years before: But perhaps this ought to be underſtood of their being but then deſign'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It does not appear that King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. or any of his Succeſſors, ever made uſe of that Liberty granted by the aforeſaid Article of his <hi>Statutes,</hi> for deferring the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Letters of El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And 'tis obſervable, before the additional Clauſe made by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. this ceremonious Courſe had been the Practice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times; and both expected from, and obſerved by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who having been elected, 6 <hi>Hen.</hi> V. was the eighth of the ſame King taken notice of for not returning, before that Time, an Anſwer, whether he accepted the Honour or no: And it appears, before the next Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> he ſent over his ready Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, both of the Honour of Election, and of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the <hi>Order;</hi> and thereupon Directions were given for his Inſtallation by the Lord <hi>Fitz Hugh,</hi> his Proxy.</p>
               <p>But for an inſtance, after the ſaid additional Clauſe, there is one remarkable enough, in the Preamble of the Sovereign's <hi>Credential Letters</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> 1 and 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> ſent with the Habit and Enſigns of the <hi>Order;</hi> in which it appears: <hi>That the Sovereign having given notice of his Election into this moſt Noble</hi> Order, <hi>he had returned back his cheerful and ready Acceptance of, and ſingular Satisfaction in the ſaid Choice; and therefore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially wiſhed it might attain its due Effect.</hi>

               <p>§ 5. That ſometimes this Honour hath not been accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appears in the ſingle caſe of <hi>Philip</hi> II.

It was therefore concluded on at the Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> held at <hi>Windſor</hi> the ſaid Year, by <hi>Humphry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> then Deputy to the Sovereign, and by, and with the unanimous conſent of the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> preſent, to ſend Letters to the ſaid elect Duke, by which he was deſired to know, whether he gave his Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or no?

And then it appears, that the ſaid Duke weighing the Statutes, and reflecting on the Quarrels between the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> his Unckle, made a plauſible Excuſe, refuſing the Election, leſt he ſhould be forced e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 1. THough the Statutes of the <hi>Order</hi> appoint and prefix a time, wherein the Sovereign's Letters of notice to an elect Knight ought to be ſent, yet as to the ſending a ſolemn Embaſſy with the Habit and Enſigns, they do not limit any certain time, but leave it wholly to the Sovereign's Pleaſure, wherein his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Conveniency, as well as that of the <hi>elect Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> is to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the Statutes of Inſtitution direct, that this Legation ſhall be diſpatched with convenient ſpeed; which muſt be interpreted to refer both to the Sovereign's conveniency of ſending, and the <hi>Stranger's</hi> capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
               <p>And therefore we find it ſix Years after the Election of the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> e'er we meet with the firſt notice of the Sovereign's determination of ſending over the Habit: For they having been elected 4 <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. the preparations for the <hi>Legation</hi> were not made till the thirty fourth Year of the ſame King; and doubtleſs ſome cauſe, within the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIIIth's Body of <hi>Statutes,</hi> this Clauſe of ſending the Legation with convenient ſpeed, is wholly omitted, and the Sovereign is not limitted as to the Time; ſo that the Habit and Enſigns have happen'd to be ſent ſometimes ſooner, ſometimes later; as the Sovereign

When the ſolemn Service is finiſh'd, the Stranger deſcends again from his Stall, and with the Proceeding before him, returns in the ſame Order he came to the Room, where he received his Inveſtiture.</p>
               <p>It's obſervable, that the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> out of a compliance with the Proteſtant Religion, cauſed, on the Day of his Inveſtiture, all Prayers to Saints incenſing, and other Matters and Ceremonies not uſed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be wholly omitted at the Service in his Chappel.</p>
               <p>At theſe great Solemnities, the inveſted Strangers have heretofore held moſt magnificent Feaſts, but of late they are not ſo much in Uſe: And when Dinner was ready, they proceeded thither in their whole Habit, which they wore all Dinner time.</p>
               <p>At the Inveſtiture of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> IV.

               <p>After theſe three Officers, the two ſuperior proceed together, the <hi>Prelate</hi> on the Right, and the <hi>Chancellor</hi> on the left; and after, the Officers of the <hi>Order</hi> follow the Sword, which is carried immediately before the Sovereign. In the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, it was born by ſome of the Barons, but of later Times it hath been conferr'd on Perſons of higher Rank, as <hi>Anno</hi> 4 <hi>Car.</hi> I. on the Earl of <hi>Dover; Anno</hi> 9 <hi>Car.</hi> I. on the Earl of <hi>Danby;</hi> and <hi>Anno</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> II. on the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mordant,</hi> then Conſtable of the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor;</hi> and at this Time 'tis uſually born by none under the Degree of an Earl.</p>

Having under the precedent Head, treated at large of the Rank and Place of all thoſe that paſs in the Proceeding, wherein all are Bare-headed, except the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and <hi>Knights-Companions:</hi> I now come to the Place whither the Proceeding is directed.</p>
               <p>The firſt Solemn Action on the Entrance of the Grand Feaſt, which the Sovereign and <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> are obliged to perform, is to Celebrate a <hi>Chapter,</hi> to which end it hath been moſt uſual for them to proceed from the Preſence Chamber, <hi>every one in their due Place and Order;</hi> firſt to the <hi>Chapter-Houſe,</hi> to conſult of things of courſe; and next into the <hi>Choir,</hi> to hear Divine Service; which has been the conſtant Cuſtom from the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. as many Examples, recorded in the Regiſters of the <hi>Order,</hi> evidence.</p>
               <p>As this Cuſtom of holding a <hi>Chapter</hi> on the Eve of the Grand Feaſt, was conſtantly obſerved when celebrated without Prorogation; ſo alſo hath a <hi>Chapter</hi> been in like manner held before <hi>Veſpers,</hi> on the Eve, at ſuch time as the Feaſt Day of St. <hi>George</hi> only hath been obſerv'd, when (for any cauſe) the Anniverſary of the Grand Feaſt receiv'd Prorogation: As for Inſtance, <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Mary,</hi> a <hi>Chapter</hi> was held at the Mannor of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, on the <hi>Vigil</hi> of St. <hi>George,</hi> before the firſt <hi>Veſpers;</hi> whereunto is fixt this Note, <hi>ut moris eſt;</hi> and the Grand Feaſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In like manner, though the Celebration of the Grand Feaſts were removed from <hi>Windſor,</hi> and obſerved at other Places, yet this uſual Cuſtom of holding a <hi>Chapter</hi> on the Eve, was always practiſed; after which the proceeding to Evening Prayer ſucceeded, as is manifeſt by ſeveral Teſtimonies from the <hi>Regiſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The publick proceſſional way to the <hi>Chapter-Houſe</hi> at <hi>Windſor,</hi> uſed Time out of Mind, led from the Preſence Chamber through the Cloiſter, and the great Gate of the King's Lodging, to the upper Ward of the Caſtle, thence through the middle Ward, and part of the lower, to and through the Paſſage, between the Eaſt End of the Chappel
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:0739200500:457"/>
and <hi>Tomb-Houſe;</hi> and thence into the <hi>Chapter-Houſe,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the North Eaſt Corner of St. <hi>George</hi>'s <hi>Chappel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Sovereign hath ſometimes thought fit to wave this publick proceſſional way, and paſs along the private way, which leads from the King's Privy Chamber, down the Stairs into the Terrace, <hi>viz.</hi> through that ſtately Walk lying on the North ſide of the Caſtle, and entring again at a Door, heretofore made through a part of the Caſtle Wall into one of the Canons Lodgings, adjoining to <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter Tower,</hi> (now made up) went thence through the Cloiſters, proceeding in the Order before ſhewed.</p>
               <p>We ſhall cloſe this Head, with obſerving, that though the Proceedings to the <hi>Chapter-Houſe</hi> or Chappel, on the Eve of the Feaſt, have moſt commonly been on Foot; yet have they been alſo on Horſe-back, on extraordinary Occaſions, as <hi>Anno</hi> 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. at which Time ſeveral Ambaſſadors being arrived here from Foreign Kings and Princes, they and many of the Nobility of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with the King's Council, the two Archbiſhops, the Biſhops of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> and the Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench, repaired alſo thither; and on the Eve, the Sovereign, accompanied with the <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> rode from the upper Quadrangle down to the College. The Queen and the King's Mother rode in a Chair, covered with rich Cloth of Gold, drawn by ſix Courſers finely Harnaſs'd, and twenty one Ladies, habited in Crimſon Velvet, rode on white Palfries: Sir <hi>Roger Cotton,</hi> Maſter of the Queen's Horſe, led her Horſe of State, whereon was a Saddle of Cloth of Gold, and three Crowns of Silver gilt; as ſoon as they alighted, the Sovereign and <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> proceeded to the <hi>Chapter-Houſe,</hi> and thence to Evening Song, which ended, they return'd in the Order they came.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the eleventh Year of his Reign, at three a Clock in the Afternoon, with all the <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> in the Habit of the <hi>Order,</hi> proceeded from the Preſence Chamber in <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> till they came to the Quadrangle, where they took their Horſes, and rode according to their Stalls, not according to their Eſtate, next before the King, and thence rode to the middle Door of the Chappel, and there alighted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded without the <hi>Choir</hi> to the <hi>Chapter-Houſe;</hi> there are other Examples, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>

But other Particulars that are occaſional, cannot ſo well be brought within Rule, as being wholly accidental.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, the Officers of the <hi>Order,</hi> ſoon after the <hi>Chapter</hi> is open'd, take their reſpective Oaths, in Order to perform the Duty of their ſeveral Places, during the Seſſion of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> and thenceforward, as is evident from ſeveral Examples, but one may ſuffice, from a <hi>Chapter</hi> held at <hi>Windſor, Anno</hi> 4 <hi>Car.</hi> I. whereat Dr. <hi>Neal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was Swo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It hath ſometimes happened, that ſome of the Officers of this <hi>Order</hi> have been Sworn at other Times, as at <hi>Chapters</hi> next enſuing their Nomination and Choice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Adminiſtration of the Oath is one of the firſt things done.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond particular debated in <hi>Chapter, viz.</hi> the diſpenſing with, or puniſhing abſent Knights; it is to be conſidered, that the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> enjoin all the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> to be preſent at the Celebration of the Grand Feaſt: that is, thoſe that are within the Kingdom, or elſewhere; although the Service of St. <hi>George,</hi> according to the Rites of the Church, be not celebrated, as on the Service of the Day whereon that of St. <hi>George</hi> has fallen, <hi>viz. Good-Friday:</hi> But with this Limitation,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0739200500:460"/>
ſo that they be in a capacity, or may conveniently repair thither.</p>
               <p>Therefore the next thing uſually entred upon in the <hi>Chapter,</hi> is the Sovereign's and <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice, whether any of the Fellowſhip make default of coming at the Hour aſſign'd; and if ſo, they are conſidered under one of theſe Heads.

               <p>The Cuſtom of ſending Letters has been very ancient: The Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Letter, under his Hand and Seal, (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his Indiſpoſition of Body,) was produc'd in <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Anno</hi> 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> V.

or diſallow of their Excuſes, but referr'd the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> to be held by Prorogation.</p>
               <p>Of Excuſes which have not been allow'd, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is that of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Scales, Anno</hi> 36 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. who were adjudg'd to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Statute, in regard the Cauſes alledged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their abſence were not approved; the latter was ſigned by the Sovereign and <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> in a Jewel to the value of twenty Marks, to be offered in the College; whereby the rigour of the <hi>Statutes</hi> appears to have been more ſtrictly executed on him, than the Duke, probably becauſe the Lord <hi>Scales</hi> was abſent the Year before, and no cauſe thereof ſhewed to the <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In relation to the Proceedings on the abſent <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> neglect of ſending their Excuſes, we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſome of them have with difficulty been remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſome left in ſuſpence, and others ſentenc'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd either to the Sovereign's pleaſure, or the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſign'd by Law; of the firſt kind we find that the Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland, Anno</hi> 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> V. though not very well, yet had much ado to be excus'd, becauſe he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified not the Cauſe of his abſence, as the <hi>Statutes</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So <hi>Anno</hi> 12 <hi>Car.</hi> I. the Earls of <hi>Derby</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> having made no Excuſe, were for that Omiſſion blameable, but by the Grace of the Sovereign for that time pardon'd.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe who, through the indulgence of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, (where probable cauſe hath induc'd it,) have not had Sentence paſs'd on them preſently, but were deferr'd in expectation of ſome ſatisfactory Cauſe to be ſhewed; we find in the Caſe of the Prince, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and five other <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> abſent from the Feaſt, held <hi>Anno</hi> 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. wherein it is regiſtred, that <hi>no cauſe of Excuſe was ſhewed, but there was an expectation of one to be alledged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for thoſe of the third ſort, on whom Sentence hath paſs'd; they have been left either to the pleaſure of the Sovereign, or to thoſe Penalties which the Law of this <hi>Order</hi> inflict; of which, as alſo of thoſe on whom Judgment hath paſs'd, are divers Inſtances.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> being all ſeated, the Prelate and Chancellor paſs into the middle of the <hi>Choir,</hi> and having made double Reverences, return to their Forms, and ſit down.

               <p>Firſt, The Serjeant of the Veſtry makes a double Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then comes before the Prelate, and makes a ſingle one to him; who thereon ariſes from his Seat, and the Serjeant proceeds before him into the middle of the <hi>Choir,</hi> where the Prelate makes a double Reverence; and paſſing forward after the Serjeant, and having aſcended the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>Haut-pas</hi> before the <hi>Altar,</hi> he makes one ſingle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence toward the ſame, and ſo goes to the North ſide of it.</p>

they divide again on each ſide, and there ſtand.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Alms-Knights come down into the <hi>Choir</hi> in a Body, and there make their joint double Reverences, and then take their Chairs; all which being finiſhed, Divine Service is begun by the Prelate.</p>
               <p>The like Solemnity is obſerved at any other Place, as well as at <hi>Windſor;</hi> where, becauſe the Alms-Knights are abſent, the Purſuivants at Arms aſcend nearer the <hi>High-Altar</hi> than when they are at <hi>Windſor;</hi> but this occaſions little Variation.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Veſpers</hi> are ended, the Prelate goes to the middle of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and with great Reverence makes an Obeyſance; and thence, with the Serjeant before him, deſcends to the middle of the <hi>Choir,</hi> where he makes his double Reverences, and ſo returns to his Seat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all make ready to paſs out of the <hi>Choir,</hi> which is performed in much the ſame manner, and with the ſame State, as they proceeded thither; and the Servants and Attendants of the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> are marſhalled in the ſame Order as they were at the beginning of the Proceeding, that the whole Proceſſion may again paſs through them.</p>
               <p>The Alms-Knights having entered the Guard Chamber, ſpread themſelves on each ſide thereof; the Prebends paſs through them, and fall off on either ſide the Room to the Preſence Chamber Door.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Purſuivants, Heralds,</hi> and <hi>Provincial Kings,</hi> proceeding through the Lane made by the Alms-Knights and Prebends, enter the Preſence Chamber, and fall off on either ſide toward the Stall, the King's ſtanding upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <p>Then enter the <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> and place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on each ſide of the State, in ſuch Order as they ſat in their Stalls, the eldeſt neareſt the State; but thoſe whoſe Companions are abſent, ſtand alone; after whom follow the Officers of the <hi>Order,</hi> diſpoſing themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently near the State.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Sovereign paſſes to the Step before the State, where, being arrived, he turns toward the <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> who make their Reverences jointly to him, and he thereon puts off his Cap, and re-ſalutes them;
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:0739200500:472"/>
which done, the Sovereign and they withdraw into the Privy Chamber till Supper time.</p>
               <p>But in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, when the Feaſt of St. <hi>George</hi> was held at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> or <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and the Sovereign, as was uſual with her, proceeded no farther on the Eve to <hi>Veſpers,</hi> than to the great Cloſet, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, and thence ſent her Lieutenant into the <hi>Choir.</hi> Then, in ſuch Caſe, when <hi>Veſpers</hi> were ended, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant returned from the <hi>Choir,</hi> through the great Hall, and ſo back to the ſaid Cloſet, and ſtood at the Door thereof, attending the Sovereign's coming forth; from whence they all proceeded before her into the Preſence-Chamber, and there the Ceremony, for that time, ended.</p>
               <p>But in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> I. when the Supper on the Eve, as alſo the following Meals, were prepared in the Banquetting-Houſe, the Sovereign's Lieutenant fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently returned from the Cloſet, by the Lobby, to the ſaid Banquetting-Houſe, inſtead of going to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the Sovereign and <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> are retired, they are not to put off any part of their Robes till Supper is over, for that is prohibited by the <hi>Statutes,</hi> not only to thoſe who do not Sup, as well as thoſe who do.

               <p>But if the Eve of the Feaſt fell out on a Faſting Day, as it did 22 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. and 11 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. the Supper was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways omitted; and the Sovereign, with his Lieutenant, and <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> were ſerved of the Void only.</p>
               <p>Nor does the Sovereign, when he Sups publickly, paſs privately to the Place; but as ſoon as notice is given that the firſt Meſs is ſet upon the Table, he preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Preſence Chamber, whence the Officers of the <hi>Order,</hi> and of Arms, the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> in their full Robes, for ſo the <hi>Statutes</hi> expreſly direct, having put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their uſual Order, proceed before him to St. <hi>George</hi>'s-<hi>Hall:</hi> Where being enteted, the <hi>Purſuivants, Heralds,</hi> and <hi>Provincial Kings,</hi> fall off all upon the right Hand, oppoſite to the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> Table, the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Purſuivants</hi> ſtanding toward the lower End of the Hall. Then the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> paſſing up beyond them, formerly divided themſelves on either ſide, according to the Decree, 16 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. and made a ſtand, each taking Place, according to the Order of their Stalls. But at the Feaſt held at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> 19 <hi>Car.</hi> II. the Sovereign di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected that they ſhould ſtand all on the right Hand ſide, facing the Table.</p>
               <p>Next, the five Officers of the <hi>Order</hi> follow, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending beyond the <hi>Senior</hi> Knight, retire on the right Hand: After them the Sovereign, and the Officers of Arms, all doing him Reverence as he paſſes by: Who paſſing up to the <hi>Haut-pas,</hi> before his own Table, turns himſelf to the <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> and putting off his Cap, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn their Reverences jointly to him.</p>

Whereupon the Officers of the <hi>Order,</hi> and of Arms, retire out of the Hall to Supper.</p>
               <p>If a Lieutenant be conſtituted, he proceeds to Supper in full Robes, and in the ſame Order as doth the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and ſits alone at the Sovereign's Table, yet on the left Hand of the Cloth of State, being ſerved in all Points with Water, and by a <hi>Cup-bearer, Carver,</hi> and <hi>Sewer,</hi> as the Sovereign himſelf is.</p>

And if the Supper be prepared in the Preſence Chamber, they then take their Leave in the ſame Room, there being no occaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed farther.</p>
               <p>If any of the <hi>Knights-Companions</hi> accompany the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, or his Lieutenant, to his Lodgings, they then go after, not before him, in regard the State of that Night's Service ended in the Preſence Chamber; and after they have retired to their Loding, they have Permiſſion to Unrobe.</p>

But this Article relates only to the <hi>Knights-Companions,</hi> not to the Sovereigns of the <hi>Order;</hi> nor do we find that any of them had Plates of their Arms and Stiles ſet upon the back of their Stalls, in manner as is before preſcribed to the reſt of the <hi>Knights-Companions.</hi>

               <p>§ 3. A third Honour paid to the defunct Knight, is a moſt ſolemn Offering up his Atchievements at the High <hi>Altar;</hi> namely, the Banner of his Arms, his Sword, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and Creſt, with its Mantlings; all which had been ſet up over his Stall at his Inſtallation.

In concluſion of which it was determined, <hi>That the ſaid Atchievements ſhou'd not again be offered, but remain over the Sovereign's Stall, for his Son King</hi> Edward VI.
