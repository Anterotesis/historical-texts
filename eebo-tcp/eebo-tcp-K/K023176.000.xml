            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:0272601000:4"/>
Ladies, who have good Sense and good Humour enough, to laugh not only at their Sex's little unguarded Follies, but at their own. But as it was communicated with the Air of a Secret, it soon found its Way into the World. An imperfect Copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller, You had the Good-Nature for my Sake to consent to the Publication of one more correct: This I was forc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had executed half my Design, for the <hi>Machinery</hi> was entirely wanting to compleat it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Machinery,</hi> Madam, is a Term invented by the Criticks, to signify that Part which the Deities, Angels, or Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, are made to act in a Poem: For the ancient Poets are in one respect like
<pb facs="tcp:0272601000:5"/>
many modern Ladies; Let an Action be never so trivial in it self, they always make it appear of the utmost Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. These Machines I determin'd to raise on a very new and odd Foundation, the <hi>Rosicrucian</hi> Doctrine of Spirits.</p>
            <p>I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard Words before a Lady; but 'tis so much the Concern of a Poet to have his Works understood, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by your Sex, that You must give me leave to explain two or three difficult Terms.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rosicrucians</hi> are a People I must bring You acquainted with. The best Account I know of them is in a French Book call'd <hi>Le Comte de Gabalis,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:0272601000:6"/>
both in its Title and Size is so like a <hi>Novel,</hi> that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by Mistake. According to these Gentlemen, the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits, which they call <hi>Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs,</hi> and <hi>Salamanders.</hi> The <hi>Gnomes,</hi> or Daemons of Earth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Mischief; but the <hi>Sylphs,</hi> whose Habitation is Air, are the best-condition'd Creatures imaginable. For they say, any Mortals may enjoy the most intimate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities with these gentle Spirits, upon a Condition very easie to all true <hi>Adepts,</hi> an inviolate Preservation of Chastity.</p>
            <p>As to the following Canto's, all the Passages of them are as Fabulous, as the Vision at the Beginning, or the Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation at the End; (except the Loss of
<pb facs="tcp:0272601000:7"/>
your Hair, which I always name with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.) The Human Persons are as Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious as the Airy ones; and the Character of <hi>Belinda,</hi> as it is now manag'd, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles You in nothing but in Beauty.</p>
            <p>If this Poem had as many Graces as there are in Your Person, or in Your Mind, yet I could never hope it should pass thro' the World half so Uncensured as You have done. But let its Fortune be what it will, mine is happy enough, to have given me this Occasion of assuring You that I am, with the truest Esteem,</p>
