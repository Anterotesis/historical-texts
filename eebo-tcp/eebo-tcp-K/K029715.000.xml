            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK.</head>
               <p>Mammon, alighting on the Holy Mount, aſſumes the form and character of a Levite, and under that appearance goes in ſearch of Judas Iſcariot. He meets that diſciple moſt opportunely for his purpoſe in a ſolitary place, and entering into converſation with him, pretends a commiſſion from the prieſts and elders for engaging him in their ſervice with the promiſe of a reward, and urges many inſidious arguments for detaching him from his Maſter: They ſeparate with a promiſe on the part of Judas to report his final anſwer to the prieſts that evening. Chriſt is now brought to view ſitting in the midſt of his diſciples at his Laſt Supper: He addreſſes them in thoſe ſolemn and affecting terms recorded in the Goſpel of Saint John, waſhes their feet, foretells his death, and points out to them his betrayer in the perſon of Judas then preſent: The traitor, perceiving himſelf diſcovered, haſtily departs. Chriſt, pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affliction of his diſciples, tenderly conſoles them with the promiſe of his ſupport under their future tribulations, and concludes with an aweful invocation to the Father in their behalf: whereupon, warning them that his hour is come, he goes forth to the garden. A reflection, naturally ſpringing from the ſubject, addreſſed to unbelievers, cloſes the book.</p>

               <head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK.</head>
               <p>Iſcariot, having ſeparated himſelf from Chriſt, wanders through the ſtreets of the city in a diſconſolate manner, and at length arrives at the brook Cedron without the gates. Here he breaks forth into ſoliloquy, in which, after reviewing his paſt ſituation, he affects to juſtify his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent motives for betraying his Maſter to the prieſts. Chriſt and his diſciples, proceeding to the Mount of Olives, are diſcovered by him as they are paſſing the brook in their way thither, and Judas reſolves upon availing himſelf of the opportunity for delivering Chriſt into the hands of his enemies. In the mean time the prieſts and elders aſſemble in the palace of Caiaphas, and there hold a council upon the meaſures to be purſued for the apprehenſion of Chriſt: The high prieſt harangues the aſſembly to this immediate purport: In the interim Judas is announced, and being admitted makes his propoſal to the council; this produces ſome obſervations on the part of Caiaphas, and is objected to by Nicodemus, who after delivering his opinion quits the aſſembly. Caiaphas then takes up the matter afreſh, controverts the ſentiments of Nicodemus, and with the approbation of all preſent cloſes with the propoſals of Judas, and ſends out a company with that traiterous diſciple to the Mount of Olives, there to apprehend the perſon of Chriſt. The aſſembly breaks up, and the hall is no ſooner evacuated by the prieſts and elders, than their ſeats are filled by Satan and his infernal ſpirits. Satan addreſſes to them a congratulatory ſpeech on the ſucceſs of Mammon's tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on whom he beſtows many high encomiums; an ovation takes place in honor of that daemon, when Chemos appears wounded by the ſpear of Gabriel, whom he had encountered on the Mount of Olives, where he had been poſted as a ſpy upon the motions of Chriſt and his diſciples. Satan, enraged at the account, ſallies forth with a reſolution to revenge the attack by puniſhing the temerity of Gabriel, arms himſelf for the occaſion, and after much proud vaunting of his ſuperior proweſs diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and the infernal ſpirits diſperſe.</p>

               <p>A general review of Chriſt's agony in the garden: His diſciples, who are ordered to watch, fall aſleep; Chriſt prays apart; he wakens them, and warns them to watch left they enter into temptation. Satan arrives, and takes poſt near the ſpot where Chriſt is praying in his agony: He is diſcovered by Gabriel, the ſupporting angel; their interview deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Chriſt approaches, and reproving Satan, by the word of power caſts him to the ground diſabled and in torments. Judas now advances with an armed company; betrays his Maſter with a kiſs; Chriſt is ſeized and carried away to the palace of the high prieſt. Satan, unable to riſe, laments over his diſconſolate condition: He is diſcovered by Mammon, who conſoles him and aſſiſts in raiſing him from the ground: Satan teſtifies to the power and divinity of Chriſt, feels a preſentiment of his impending doom, and having delivered his laſt injunctions to Mammon, is lifted from the earth by a ſtormy guſt and carried through the air out fight of that evil ſpirit, who terrified by the fate of his chief turns to flight and eſcapes.</p>

               <head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK.</head>
               <p>This Book, propoſing to treat of the trial and condemnation of Chriſt, opens with an invocation to the Evangeliſts, the ſacred hiſtorians of that event.—Chriſt, brought before the prieſts and elders in council, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the witneſſes, interrogated by Caiaphas, perſiſts in keeping ſilence, till being ſolemnly called upon to declare himſelf, he anſwers by an affirmation of the truth. Inſtantly all voices are let looſe upon him, accuſing him of blaſphemy and pronouncing him worthy of death: He is delivered over to mockery and inſult. The Jews reſolve to arraign him before Pilate on the following morning. He turns and looks upon Peter, who according to prediction had three ſeveral times denied him. The ſorrow and contrition of that Diſciple is deſcribed; he retires apart to bewail his crime and ſupplicate forgiveneſs. His prayer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the temple-porch. The council of the Jews reſort to Pilate next morning and appeal againſt Chriſt. He informs them that by the Roman law no judgment can be given till the accuſed is confronted with his accuſers, and heard in his defence. Now commences the trial of Chriſt before Pilate, who, finding nothing worthy of death in that juſt perſon, refers him to Herod as belonging to his juriſdiction. Herod, after mocking him, arrays him in a gorgeous robe, and in that apparel ſends him back to Pilate. He again appears in the judgment hall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pilate, who after many fruitleſs efforts to ſave him, the Jews ſtill urging him by their clamorous importunity to crucify him, finding no other way to prevent a tumult of the people, after declaring himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the blood of Jeſus by the ceremony of waſhing his hands before the multitude, delivers him to be crucified.</p>

               <p>Judas Iſcariot ſeized with remorſe returns the thirty pieces of ſilver to the prieſts and departs: Mammon reaſſumes the habit of a Levite, and meeting Judas after he had returned the money to the prieſts, inſtigates him to deſtroy himſelf. That evil ſpirit now takes wing and repairs to the wilderneſs, convenes the daemons from all parts of Paleſtine, and informing them of Satan's expulſion from earth, warns them by his command to betake themſelves to flight before the hour of Chriſt's cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion: This is no ſooner announced than the whole infernal hoſt breaks up in diſorder and diſperſes to various parts of the world therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.—The ſubject of the Crucifixion is now brought forward: The proceſſion ſets out for Mount Calvary; Chriſt bearing his croſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed by the ſpectators as he paſſes: He is ſeen by Gabriel and the angels with him from the mount, on which they were ſtationed: He addreſſes himſelf to the daughters of Jeruſalem: The executioners nail his hands and feet to the croſs; the prieſts revile him and call upon him to come down; one of the malefactors crucified with him caſts the ſame in his teeth; he is reproved by the other, whoſe penitence is rewarded by the promiſe of immediate ſalvation and glory: Chriſt from the croſs recommends his mother to John the beloved diſciple: Chriſt dies: The ſun is darkened, the earth quakes, the rocks are rent, and the bodies of the ſaints and prophets are raiſed from the dead and appear upon earth: The prieſts and elders, alarmed by theſe prodigies, reſort to Pilate and demand a guard of Romans to defend the ſepulchre, leſt the diſciples ſhould take away the body of Chriſt and pretend that he was riſen: Pilate replies, that they have a watch; bids them ſee to it themſelves and diſmiſſes them.</p>

               <head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.</head>
               <p>This Book opens with the ſcene of Mount Calvary at the coming on of evening; Chriſt ſtill hanging dead upon the croſs, the diſciples ſtanding apart and the holy women watching, amongſt whom is the Bleſſed Virgin ſupported by St. John, Chriſt having bequeathed her to his care: His addreſs to her on this ſubject, and her reply. The ſoldiers come and break the legs of the two malefactors, but finding Chriſt already dead, they pierce his heart with a ſpear and blood and water iſſues from the wound: They take him down from the croſs and lay him in the ſepulchre. His ſpirit in the meanwhile is conveyed by the angels into the region of Death; that region deſcribed, and the diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the bottomleſs pit, where the ſouls of the wicked are in torment: Chriſt points out theſe ſcenes to Gabriel and inſtructs him as to the future objects of his deſcent into this gloomy region. Satan expelled from earth falls proſtrate at the foot of the throne of Death: He makes ſuit to that power for protection: Death rejects his interceſſions: The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and palace of the King of Terrors deſcribed: The triumphant entry of Chriſt: Satan is hurled into the bottomleſs pit and there bound by the ſtrong angel; the horrors of that dreadful abode are repreſented: Death humbles himſelf before the Redeemer of mankind, and conſcious that his power is overthrown, tenders his crown to Chriſt as to his conqueror: He lays the key at his feet, which ſets free the ſouls of the Saints, who are deſtined to be partakers of the firſt reſurrection: This key is given to Gabriel with inſtructions for their releaſe: Chriſt in his reply to Death forewarns him of his doom, but ſignifies to him that the diſſolution of his power will not be immediate. The approach of the Saints concludes the Book.</p>
