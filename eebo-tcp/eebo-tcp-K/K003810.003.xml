            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</head>
               <p>O RAYMOND, Raymond! my oldeſt friend, my trueſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, pity, ah pity the anguiſh of a father—pity a parent whoſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have driven away his child! Emma hath eloped. Heaven knows where ſhe has wandered. Under pretence of viſiting a friend near town, ſhe went in one of the public ſtages, with intent, as ſhe ſaid, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the evening. The friend whom ſhe <hi>pretended</hi> to viſit was Mrs. Arnold of Richmond, on whom ſhe had often called in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly way. I remained therefore perfectly unalarmed till twilight. A
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0149005103:12"/>
tempeſt of thunder and lightening happening about nine o'clock, I ſent over a ſervant to Mrs. Arnold's, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining ſhe might be afraid to come through it alone. The ſervant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Mrs. Arnold with news that Emma called there for a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes by way of morning ride, but went away in a great hurry. It was near midnight before I received theſe horrid tidings, and then I ordered my horſes to be harneſſed, and went at full ſpeed to every houſe where the ſtages ſet up. The people were all in bed, and I obtained anſwers to my queſtions with difficulty. None were ſatisfactory. I traverſed the ſtreets in a diſtracted manner, for oh, you know how I doat upon Emma! I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0149005103:13"/>
could not give the coachman any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and he continued dragging me about, but I bid him go any where rather than to my own houſe. No trace—no clue—no glimmering of hope! Hard-hearted girl! What though I urged her to forget the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous Henry, am not I her father? But I will be calm, I will cut her from my affections for ever. I am juſt got home. It is day-break. The ſervants are all diſperſed to hunt after a runaway girl. What a dreadful morning! The hemiſphere is in a blaze!—The wind blows hard!—The firmament opens its flaming breaſt!—I ſee into its bowels. I am ſitting all alone. Oh my heart, what a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap was there!—It is now rolling
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0149005103:14"/>
along the ſphere. Oh Emma, Emma, my daughter—my child—my darling—where, where art thou? Another! WONDER-WORKING GOD! behold a contrite parent upon his knees, lame and decrepid as he is, to ſupplicate a covering for the beloved fugitive. Perhaps, Raymond, our poor diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate—the mutual joy of our hearts—perhaps ſome ſudden ſtroke of—I dare not turn imagination that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible way. No, no: Emma is at laſt diſobedient, ſhe is baſe, ſhe has abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her father, ſhe—</p>
               <p>Wherefore do not my ſervants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? Villains, how dare they ſport with a ſorrow like mine? They know not what it is to be a parent!</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0149005103:20"/>
becauſe I would ſuffer ſome reproach myſelf, rather than try to eſtabliſh an irregular example. But the power who is giving me ſtrength to ſuſtain the great buſineſs I am about to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, has placed in my boſom ſomething which reconciles me to the enterprize. Oh Sir Robert, there is a duty which <hi>muſt</hi> be performed—at leaſt attempted. Nature, reaſon, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and faith the moſt hallowed, all ſtir within me; nay, God himſelf, at the marking of whoſe awful name, I bow, ſeems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I may ſeem to be romantic, when I mean only to ſhew myſelf ſincere. All ſort of reſearch will be vain. I would not have yielded to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0149005103:21"/>
the leaſt ſemblance of a ſcheme, which is moſt terrible to my nature, could it by any means have been avoided. My father will call to mind certain ſentiments, and do me juſtice in his own dear boſom on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>Sir Robert Raymond, I ever deſired to be uniform, and to reconcile the diſtinct parts of my conduct with the whole. Yet I will bear up againſt the charge of impropriety in this one inſtance for the ſake of —but further explanation is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Go then, oh amiable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator betwixt parent and child—go, and plead my cauſe in all the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of friendſhip. Obtain for me
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0149005103:22"/>
the paternal pardon—ſuſtain his heart, and do not leave him a prey to ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Excuſe my forbearing to give you my addreſs. Pity the concealments which are thus impoſed. Be it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that I will continue to ſend you accounts of myſelf at every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>

               <head>TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</head>
               <p>YOUR letter, Sir Robert, with its dear and dreadful incloſure came to hand. It is now before my eyes, which are ſtreaming in penitence for the phrenzy which has baniſhed my daughter. I now behold the whole matter too plain. Oh, my friend, I treated the moſt dutiful of children with unwonted harſhneſs, and in the patriot I extinguiſhed the parent. I expected that a ſoul like Emma's ſhould circumſcribe itſelf within the pale of politics. Curſe on the rage of party! Execrated be the tyranies of war! Ah what are cauſes, countries,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0149005103:24"/>
worlds, to the loſs of one dear child adorned with the virtues of Emma Corbett! Blind, doating zeal! what haſt thou to do with an old man's heart? What, with the ſacred ſeaſon of the ſilver hair? Is mine an age to engage in theſe tumultuous ſubjects? No. I ſhould have taken my darling daughter to my boſom, and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently for the returning embrace of a divided people. <hi>That</hi> would have been true patriotiſm and true philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy. Inſtead of which, dolt and dotard as I was, I mixed with hot-headed giddineſs in the affray. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted myſelf in every fugitive breath of vague intelligence; and, while I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0149005103:25"/>
talked of juſtice, I was encouraging ſlaughter; wholly forgetting, or too blood-thirſty to remember, that either army is compoſed of kindred and of countrymen. Behold Raymond, how I am puniſhed! But where, where all this time is Emma? No date! No addreſs! A young creature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended, alone, of a delicate frame, and harraſſed by fatigue! <hi>Sick</hi> alſo! Never uſed to travel unattended—Oh heaven! But ſhe will return. The thought makes me eaſier. Let me indulge it. How tender will I be to her—with what fondneſs will I hang upon her neck, and hide her bluſhes in my boſom—how will I talk—how ſoothe—how conſole her—oh I will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0149005103:26"/>
kiſs her into confidence and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I will even converſe—(pardon me Sir Robert, pardon the effuſions of a repenting heart)—I will even converſe upon her darling theme.—The name of Henry ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and, if it does her good, not without tenderneſs. Alas! what has the youth done, but—Yes, yes, Emma will return. She muſt. She ſhall. The ſlender and trembling thread of my being is ſuſtained by no other hope.</p>
               <p>I have ſent advertiſements to the papers, inviting her home, deſcribing perſon, circumſtances, and ſituations, but concealing names. I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0149005103:27"/>
various meſſengers to all the ports to have her tenderly intreated, almoſt cordially <hi>controuled,</hi> ſhould her romantic nature—for oh I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſhe meditates—Was there ever any thing ſo wild—But ſhe will never be able to carry it into execution, and I will not even ſuppoſe it practicable. She will return. I ſhall recover the treaſure of my age. But the interim is anguiſh—oh, haſten my friend to ſoften it. I am ſick, and Emma is not at my ſide. I ſee her not at the harpſichord—I hear not her enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice—I contemplate not her lovely features—all, all the exact images of her dear mother—her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! who would ſhudder in her grave were ſhe—</p>

               <p>I AM not ſorry you found it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to meet me. Objects of gloom, I know, are intolerable to you. Caſtleberry at preſent affords little elſe. I uſed, my friend, to fly from theſe as aſſiduouſly as yourſelf. Yet now they are become very dear. I love the ſolitude which this ſcene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords me. It was lately adorned by the ſociety of Emma. Ah elegant and hapleſs girl! She has not only eloped, but engaged me to juſtify the ſtep ſhe has taken to her father. Oh Frederick, her language is ſo ſweet, her power over me ſo reſiſtleſs, and her firm affection for this happy Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0149005103:30"/>
this heroic rival, ſo reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that my whole ſoul yields im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience to the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which involve me in deſpair! What, of things poſſible, would I not do to ſecure to her but one moment's happineſs? Alas! my friend, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely as I know you love me, I dare not tell you all that I intend to do. Yet conſider a young creature about to venture on the wild and uncertain ocean, moved by a ſacred impulſe in favour of a worthy lover, who has himſelf left a blooming miſtreſs, whoſe ſociety he conſents to ſacrifice, to his country. Conſider alſo this lover, as one who is the choice of Emma, and is every way ſuitable to her in perſon as in age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0149005103:31"/>
When you have maturely weighed theſe circumſtances, then tell me what at <hi>my</hi> age and under <hi>my</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I ought to do. My friend, no man knows what virtue or what energy there is in him till after the hour of ſerious exertion.</p>
               <p>There is a project, Berkley, rolling in my mind, and if on a little more reflection I can reconcile it wholly to the dictate that uniformly ſways me, I ſhall undertake ſomething that will excite your <hi>ridicule.</hi> But for any thing of that kind I ſhall be prepared. I have only two great powers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, my reaſon and my conſcience. What they inſpire can never be

Do not, dear Louiſa, accuſe me of wanting confidence becauſe I did not acquaint you with my deſign.

                  <head>SECOND INCLOSURE FROM SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</head>
                  <p>CORBETT, the ſeal of Providence is ſurely upon my enterprize! Oh happy chance! I have at once ſaved and reſcued your daughter. It pleaſed God to carry me into the ſame place of confinement, where I found her mingled with the multitude of our unhappy countrymen. A violent ſhriek upon my entrance betrayed her to me. Her man's apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes ſo familiar with her voice and her features. She fainted in my arms.</p>
                  <p>The priſoners were too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ſullen gloom of their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0149005103:65"/>
own melancholy to regard the diſtreſs of another. The paper which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe, ſpotted, as you ſee, with drops of blood from her own lovely arm, fell from her boſom. By the time ſhe recovered, one of the officers who had guarded us approached.—She looked at him a moment (it being the firſt time ſhe had ſeen him ſince he came in) and then ſunk without any appearance of life upon the floor. She lay as a corpſe.</p>
                  <p>Oh merciful Heaven!—Oh God, great and gracious God! cried the officer, it is—it is—it muſt be Emma—it muſt be my SISTER!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0149005103:66"/>Preſently, Emma and Edward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett (for it was your ſon my friend) were both embracing upon their knees.</p>
                  <p>It was no time to explain. She was moved out of the priſon. I was permitted to attend. Edward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett in his own arms conveyed her to an apartment. He obtained leave of abſence from the farther duties of the day. He was the nurſe of your poor Emma. Oh, Mr. Corbett, <hi>I</hi> was not idle.</p>
                  <p>Waſhington happened to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at the ſame town, preparing the manoeuvres of a new attack. He is eaſy of acceſs; and being at liberty on
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0149005103:67"/>
a parole of honour I gained an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</p>
                  <p>Ah, can you not gueſs its motive? what <hi>could</hi> it be but the <hi>freedom</hi> of the captive Emma? The General heard the ſtory of her love as I related it. I concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer folly. I brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it. The ſoldier's cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear. He wept.</p>
                  <p>Sacred, ſaid he, be the rights of hoſpitality: I am not at war with the <hi>affections.</hi> Ever priviledged be <hi>their</hi> emotions. I feel them all. The
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0149005103:68"/>
beauteous priſoner is at liberty, Sir Robert, to go where ſhe pleaſes. I ſhall appoint perſons to attend her, who may prevent all interruption and inſult; but <hi>you</hi> methinks Sir Robert, ſhould continue to follow her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes as a <hi>friend,</hi> you are <hi>both</hi> free.</p>
                  <p>I flew to Edward Corbett with the tidings. Emma had by this time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with her ſituation.</p>
                  <p>At what a moment did I enter the room! Your ſon was pronuncing or rather <hi>attempting</hi> to pronounce, the names of wife and parent, of Louiſa and his little Edward. And have I then theſe bleſſings, (cried he) and is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0149005103:69"/>
my father <hi>yet</hi> in ignorance what claims, what doubly-tender claims, Louiſa Corbett hath upon him? He then preſſed his ſiſter in his arms, and they wept together.</p>
                  <p>Surprizes came too faſt upon the hapleſs youth. He knew not that Henry was under arms. He did not know that he was an enemy. Yet he dropped for awhile the fierceneſs of the ſoldier, and acted as a man—as the child of nature—as the huſband of Louiſa, and the brother of Emma. Then go, my ſiſter, ſaid he, your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer is too glorious to be checked. In contemplating your conduct, I riſe above all the prejudices of party. Alas, my ſiſter, I know too well the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0149005103:70"/>
ſorrows of love and ſeparation not to reſpect them. You find me here the foe of Henry, but it is not now the day of battle, and were he at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, ſhould I not expand theſe arms to receive the lover of Emma? Go then. But we are on the eve of a deſperate undertaking.—Our army moves to-morrow. I tremble for thee! Perhaps we may never meet more—perhaps—ah retire, retire my beſt loved ſiſter, ere the idea of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you for ever ſhould tempt me to break my promiſe, and—</p>
                  <p>—This fraternal kiſs, this affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate embrace, and farewell. Give me not leiſure to reflect, let me not have opportunity to conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0149005103:71"/>
of thus—Ah take her from me, Sir Robert, ſhe is gaining on my affections, and I ſhall not be able—</p>
                  <p>Here he ſtopped Mr. Corbett; Emma beheld the gathering ſtorm of tenderneſs coming on, and exerting a reſolution more than human, as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſhould be prevented from purſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing the great object of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, which was even dearer than a brother, ſhe caught me by the arm and ſhortened a ſcene too poignant to be continued.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner were we alone—I am interrupted. Farewell.</p>

                  <p>No ſooner had we got beyond the reach of thoſe ſighs which were break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the heart of Edward, than his lovely ſiſter fell upon her knees, preſſed my hand to her boſom, and ſpake thus.—Oh generous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, I devote to thee the firſt moment that the confuſions of crouding inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents allow, to pour ſorth the tribute of my gratitude. I aſk not the means by which heaven directed you to me, but I feel the motive of your voyage ſo pathetically, ſo perfectly, ſo—ah Sir Robert, wherefore do you heap on me this agonizing goodneſs? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did you purſue the footſteps of one whoſe pre-occupied heart and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0149005103:73"/>
plighted hand make it impoſſible to reward your kindneſs or your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity? Not even a beloved brother, whom I thought breathed no more, not even Edward, long-loſt and newly found, could prevail with me to forego the purpoſe of my pilgrimage. No, by this affecting effuſion of tears which are now bathing your hand, I ſwear—but it is unneceſſary. Behold a woman firmly reſolved, Sir Robert, oh why are you then—indeed it is vain, <hi>indeed</hi> it is. Go then I conjure you, return to my dear, my drooping father—aſſure him that his Emma is in no danger—tell him that his darling ſon is found; alas! how I forget myſelf, of this you ſay he is already informed, but at all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0149005103:74"/>
events return; it is to no end that you follow me: how can you expect—</p>
                  <p>I expect it <hi>not</hi> Miſs Corbett, ſaid I, attempting to raiſe her up.</p>
                  <p>Here will I remain, cried ſhe, till you pledge to me your honour that you will here cloſe the debts which it will never be in my power to diſcharge. It is no place or time for argument, Sir Robert. You are even now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting me from the great buſineſs of my life. I beſeech you to leave me. I am not ignorant of your paſſion, but I thought your prudence in never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it to me by your own mouth—in ſhort ſir, I muſt inſiſt on—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0149005103:75"/>I ſaw her miſtake, my dear Corbett, and briefly explained it. How ſhall I deſcribe to you the emanation, the burſt of tender gratitude, when ſhe found—but indeed I do not deſerve half ſhe ſaid, or half ſhe thought.</p>
                  <p>Alas! it is paſſion ſtill that drives meon—not, indeed, the paſſion which partakes of one groſs image, or of one vehement appetite. Pitied be the wretch who perſecutes an engaged heart. Yet I love to ſee, to ſerve, to oblige her—I love to—</p>
                  <p>Again interrupted! No wonder. I am writing amidſt ſcenes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſturbance. The ſeats and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres of war are before me. The
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0149005103:76"/>
guards of a generous enemy, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to private woe, are in front and in rear. It is all deathful prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. There is no proſpect of peace. On every brow is defiance. In every eye flaſhes the bloody determination. We hear the ſhrieks of widows and daughters and fatherleſs children, as we move forward. Families are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in burying their dead, reſcued from the corruption of promiſcuous carnage. Hearſes and funerals paſs thick along. The bell of death tolls out in every ſtreet; but Emma is ſtill fixed in her deſign.

                  <p>By heavens Corbett, the roſes are ſuddenly thrown over the cheek of your child, and the pale of fatigue and ſickeſs and loſs of blood, (which has not been inconſiderable) all give way
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0149005103:78"/>
to the joyful expectation of ſeeing her Henry.</p>
                  <p>Surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our disappointments to amiable account. To conquer affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not, I feel, always poſſible; but to direct it from one worthy path into another, when the former is unfit or unjuſt, is aſſuredly in our power. Henry himſelf cannot adore Emma more ſincerely than myſelf. My whole heart is hers; oft it trembles, oft it bleeds, but the choice either to be the object of eſteem or the object of averſion is before me. Oh I would not forfeit the partial ſentiment which my conduct has lodged in the breaſt of Emma, for any other earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0149005103:79"/>
She owns me for her friend, her <hi>firſt</hi> of friends. She talks to me without reſerve.—She looks at me ſometimes till the heart's ſoft tear is in her eye. Ah, that tear! it is more worth than the poſſeſſion of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, or importunity, extorted into their arms. I feel it ſtream over my ſenſes. Bleſſed ſympathy! Pure ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion! Generous, glorious Emma!</p>
                  <p>I am penciling theſe informations of our route, ſometimes in the vehicle and ſometimes in a room.</p>
                  <p>Emma has this moment deſired the driver to ſtop. The door of the chaiſe is open; ſhe jumps out, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0149005103:80"/>
to me in a whiſper, that a lucky thought ſtrikes her.</p>

                  <p>God of all goodneſs! didſt thou ever create another Emma?</p>
                  <p>In paſſing along, ſhe took note of ſome buſhes which were covered thickly with a dun-coloured berry that cluſtered in the hedge-rows. I aſſiſted her in gathering theſe without daring to aſk for information as to cauſes. She hath an air of intreaty which cuts ſhort all curioſity about motive, and leaves us no other ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0149005103:81"/>
than that of gratifying her by implicit obedience.</p>
                  <p>I knew not the deſign of Emma in picking the berries till the evening, and <hi>then</hi> ſhe explained to me their uſe.</p>
                  <p>Now for an <hi>experiment,</hi> dear Sir Robert, ſaid ſhe, taking up the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and going into her chamber at a publick-houſe where we baited at twilight.</p>
                  <p>In about an hour ſhe re-entered—ſhe <hi>re-entered,</hi> Corbett; but oh how different from that Emma who had ſo recently retired! You know the clear and lucid white that mixes with the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0149005103:82"/>
eloquent bloom in her countenance—you know that rich tint of tenderneſs and ardour, of pathetic ſoftneſs and graceful paſſion, which forms her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Imagine my aſtoniſhment at beholding theſe diſcoloured in the darkeſt ſhade of that peculiar diſguiſe which the juice of the berries we had collected caſt over the ſkin. The ſtain was deep, ſtrong, and apparently fixed. It reſembled almoſt exactly the hue of ſome of the ſavages whom we had obſerved to be wounded in a town through which we paſſed.</p>
                  <p>It was certainly <hi>inſpiration,</hi> (ſaid Emma, rejoicing at the alteration as ſhe ſurveyed it in the glaſs.) Ah how preferable this precious dye, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0149005103:83"/>
ſhe, to the faireſt complexion in the world. I ſhall aſſiſt Henry, I ſhall touch his dear hand, and attend him in every danger, without diſtreſſing him by ſurprize, or diſarming him by ſoftneſs. Oh, my good Sir Robert, romantic as may ſeem the ſteps I have taken, be aſſured that I proceed with the utmoſt caution. I do not even <hi>now</hi> deſign to interfere with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid virtues of Henry's profeſſion. I will not dare to place myſelf betwixt him and his duty. I will ſhare his dangers, but cannot conſent any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to bear about a wretched being without at leaſt attempting to render it ſerviceable to my friend. Your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity well fits you to receive theſe apologies, if indeed any apologies

                  <p>I could not reply, Mr. Corbett. Even her avowals of the affection that ſhe bears to Henry become new ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my tenderneſs and admiration. But we are ſetting off again.</p>

a village after a ſudden attack. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward drew his unavailing ſword to defend himſelf and the inhabitants, who were flying different ways in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deſpair.—And there my friend it was your ſon received his wound—his wound of death.</p>
                  <p>The conquerors drove off the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, loaded themſelves with the ſpoils of conqueſt, then ſuffered the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants to eſcape, and returned to the troops from whence they had been detached.</p>
                  <p>Edward bled faſt; but having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our route, he gave directions to the two ſoldiers who accompanied him and preſſed onward. He was reſolved
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0149005103:87"/>
once more, he ſaid, to behold his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The men, who were indeed of thoſe under his command, obeyed his orders; ſupported him on each ſide as he ſat in the chaiſe, till, poor young man!—</p>
                  <p>—You know the reſt. He ſunk upon one of their ſhoulders, and with his dying breath inſiſted on their taking his corpſe to Emma, of whom he had received tydings by the guide who had laſt left us, and whom he met on his return.</p>
                  <p>The poor fellows came on diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate with their dead maſter. They reached the town where we ſtopped, and were paſſing the window of our

inn, when we heard a cry of "the armies are engaged, the armies are engaged!"</p>
                  <p>The poſtilion got from his horſe; the two ſoldiers (who had taken the precaution to alter their dreſs as Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans) leaped from the carriage, and joined the multitude that thronged the ſtreets.</p>
                  <p>The body of Edward was deferred. Emma, (who had then juſt finiſhed her remarks on her diſguiſe) ſeeing a man lie motionleſs, approached the chaiſe door, and there ſhe beheld—</p>

No language can deſcribe her agonies, but they were attended to by none but myſelf: for the whole town was in conſternation at the news of the engagement. Every houſe was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied. The two armies had marched all night, and diſtributed their forces. We heard of the largeſt parties being engaged off John's-Town, and in that place was quartered the regiment of Henry. What was to be done? Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lay dead before us. Emma was folding his clay-cold body in her arms. She ſeemed to be loſt in a ſtupor of irremediable grief. She forgot for awhile her Henry. The alarm ſpread every moment more wide—horror

To continue in ſuch a ſituation was madneſs: to leave the breathleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Edward—oh ſhocking thought!—Oh Mr. Corbett, the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of war, and the terrors of a town under ſuch a panic, are not to be deſcribed.

                  <p>It was in vain to expoſtulate. She ſaw the danger, but felt no emotions of diſmay. All feminine and gentle as ſhe is, ſhe roſe above the ſpirit of humanity.</p>

                  <p>At laſt, ſummoning her utmoſt ſtrength, ſhe exclaimed "the will of God be done." and then, in weeping ſubmiſſion, joined me.</p>

               <p>By gentle degrees—oh, Mr. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett, let me open upon you the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which, by the contrivance of

Providence, have been brought about. Summon your heart to bear the beſt, the deareſt news which it is in the nature of human things for you to hear.

               <p>From the point of death your Emma has recovered. The interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hand of heaven was <hi>ſuddenly</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>Ten days after the departure of Sir Robert's pacquet, ſhe was in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to leave her bed. To what <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> did ſhe leave it? Reſolution, oh how ſacred is thy force when anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the breath of love!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0149005103:107"/>If Henry be dead, ſaid ſhe, it is ſtill the duty of Emma to pay him the mournful offices which ſhe has paid to Edward.</p>
               <p>She inſiſted on ſearching for the corpſe of the man who had cauſed all her misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The generous Sir Robert Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond was at that time himſelf confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſickneſs which threatened his life: when he was out of danger, Emma gave him in tendereſt charge, and ſet out, alone, towards thoſe woods where ſome late ſkirmiſhes had paſſed. On her way ſhe had the precaution to uſe again thoſe berries which tinge the ſkin: to theſe ſhe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0149005103:108"/>
added a certain bark that had been mentioned to her in the courſe of her various enquiries.</p>
               <p>Behold, oh Mr. Corbett, behold the dear and delicate Emma, wandering, unprotected, in the woods of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.—Behold her bearing over her tender ſhoulder the mere neceſſaries of decent covering.—Behold the moſt gentle, and moſt female form expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all the dangers of a wild and unknown country—picking her food from the hedges—ſtraying ſhe knew not whither—in diſguiſe—in diſorder —in deſpair!</p>
               <p>Incredible were the toils of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch—incredible her fatigue. The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0149005103:109"/>
foreſts are here, you know, of great extent: the wilds immeſurable.</p>
               <p>After ſeveral days travelling, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time ſhe had not encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered any paſſenger who could give her the leaſt intelligence, ſhe ſat her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down as uſual, about the noon, and wept over her misfortunes.</p>
               <p>Scarce had ſhe reſted a moment, ere the clamour of human voices, ſhouting at a ſmall diſtance, caught her attention. She preſſed haſtily forward through the foliage, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, at a little aperture in the foreſt, a party of ſoldiers engaging with a tribe of Indians; but while ſhe was eagerly examining the perſons of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0149005103:110"/>
                  <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> were put to flight, and retreated with the utmoſt prerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation: the ſoldiers purſued, and both were out of ſight ere Emma had time to approach nearer to them.</p>
               <p>She ſaw enough, however, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her that the regimentals were Britiſh, and the uniform of the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icers ſuch as belonged to the regiment of Henry, you will gueſs her deſpair when ſhe did not perceive Henry amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The bodies of ſeveral Engliſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were ſeen in different parts of the foreſt, but the corpſe of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond could, by no diligence, be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0149005103:111"/>Still indefatigable, ſhe went on, though by this time reduced almoſt to the laſt exigencies of nature, and every thing ſubdued but tender reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and the love which inſpired it.</p>
               <p>At length, Providence relented to her wiſhes, and directed her ſteps to a broad common path-way, acroſs which was extended a human figure, lying as dead, with an arrow ſticking in his boſom. You already perceive that it was no other than <hi>Henry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> This, you <hi>may</hi> perceive, but no tongue can give you the fainteſt idea of that unparalleled heroiſm and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which now inſpired the ſoul of Emma! She found the body yet warm, the pulſe ſlowly moving, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0149005103:112"/>
the heart languidly beating with life. She extracted the arrow, and ſucked the wound—ſhe had heard of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians uſing ſhafts whoſe points were envenomed: and rightly concluding <hi>this</hi> to be one of them, applied to it her lovely lips without heſitation.—This addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional danger, was an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional motive to the deed. Oh Mr. Corbett, whatan angel is Emma!</p>
               <p>Signs of exiſtence increaſed. With ſcarce a covering from the ſky, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Emma ſheltered her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate charge for many days. Ere his ſenſes returned, ſhe thickened her diſguiſe by all the arts in her power. Oh can any thing leſs eloquent than the great Author of Nature deſcribe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0149005103:113"/>
to you the tranſport of this wondrous creature when ſhe firſt beheld the long-cloſed eye of Henry open on the light —and open on herſelf?</p>
               <p>Think Mr. Corbett, how difficult <hi>concealment</hi> muſt have been at this extatic moment; then, conſider what preſence of mind was neceſſary, to repreſs the dear and dangerous effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The ſilver tones of the ſofteſt voice in the world were ſo artfully changed, as to correſpond with the reſt of her appearance. She fed him with what the fortune of an hour's hunting amongſt the fruits of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt afforded. He could not move. No ſoldiers returned. Men drop in a ſkirmiſh, and are ſought for no more.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0149005103:114"/>
No houſe was near: no hut: and ſhe dared not ſtray too far from the place where he lay, leſt ſhe ſhould loſe ſight of the ſpot. But now Henry felt the puncture of a want which even Emma could not accommodate. Fruits and vegetables, collected by chance, as they grew obvious, and within the beat of Emma's journeyings, were too unſubſtantial. It ſeemed as if famine would compleat what poiſon had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. For lack of proper nutriment after fatigues ſo imminent, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to an extreme of languor even worſe than that of Emma; whom ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs ſeemed to have rendered ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to every thing that could befall herſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0149005103:115"/>In theſe moments it was that Henry yielded to deſpair—in theſe moments his heart melted with gratitude to his protector—</p>
               <p>Oh generous unknown, (ſaid he feebly) whoſoever thou art, receive the dying acknowledgements of the man whom thou haſt endeavoured to reſcue from an untimely death. Had thoſe kind endeavours ſucceeded, what thanks ſhouldeſt thou receive from one of the <hi>beſt</hi>—the <hi>deareſt</hi>—but it may not be—I am nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted—perhaps, ere yet another hour moves by—leſt that <hi>ſhould</hi> be the caſe, let me, oh let me, while yet I have the power to call down heaven's choiceſt bleſſings on that lovely
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0149005103:116"/>
mourner, whoſe tears are haply ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this moment for the expiring Henry—Ah ſir, ah worthy youth, couldſt thou ſee her—couldſt thou atteſt for me theſe dying ſentiments—couldſt thou aſſure her that with my lateſt breath—But that is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhe is a thouſand leagues from theſe fatal ſhores. No matter. Oh hear me GOD ! do <hi>thou,</hi> this <hi>night,</hi> this <hi>inſtant,</hi> ſuggeſt to her what was my laſt employment—my laſt aſpiration. Oh Emma! Emma! my life, my love!—</p>
               <p>Here he fell on the boſom of Emma, and would <hi>indeed</hi> have died had he known it was Emma that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0149005103:117"/>She preſſed his hand. She could not ſpeak. To the Omnipotent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercy ſhe caſt the imploring eye!</p>
               <p>Let not the human heart give up its confidence in Heaven. It is never too late to truſt!</p>
               <p>A team now paſt within ſight of this diſconſolate pair. They were laden with proviſions and apparel drawn in ſledges, and ſmall waggons, and were on their way to three detachments of ſoldiers, (who had applied to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for theſe accommodations) that were ſtationed on the north ſide of the foreſt. Amongſt this groupe were alſo ſome cattle, of which ſome were
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0149005103:118"/>
cows. It is unneceſſary to ſay what uſe the unwearied Emma made of theſe: her winning addreſs, and the moving ſimplicity of her grief, joined to the wretched ſituation of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh officer who appeared to be almoſt at the point of death, gained ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon the ſoldiers and people who attended the ſledges and wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, that they adminſtered whatever could promote the wiſh of Emma, and even furniſhed her with a ſledge, a mule, and a guide, to carry Captain Hammond to John's-Town.</p>
               <p>Thus providentially ſaved from death a <hi>ſecond</hi> time, I ſhall not trouble you with other difficulties in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, or in the progreſs of Henry's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0149005103:119"/>
though the leaſt of theſe were enough to immortalize Emma Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett bett; but I ſhall convey your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to John's-Town, where Henry and his protecor at laſt arrived, and found Sir Robert Raymond recovered from his fever, and juſt about to ſet out again in purſuit of Emma.</p>
               <p>To her aſſiduous cares were now ſuperadded thoſe of this excellent man, and Henry became in a ſhort time the nurſeling of both. He could walk, converſe, and his wound was healing. Emma's dear perilous experiment was guarded—the proſpect clear on every ſide. One afternoon Sir Robert gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually prepared. Henry for the ſofteſt ſurprize that could touch the heart of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0149005103:120"/>
a lover; he diſcovered himſelf to be the friend of Mr. Corbett—he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Henry that he ſaw Emma in good health a little before he left England —he aſſerted, in the ſtrongeſt terms, her constancy, her attachment, her love—and ſaid that ſuch was the force of her affection he ſhould not wonder ſome day or other to hear that ſhe was arrived in America.</p>
               <p>—<hi>Yes,</hi> and in America ſhe <hi>is</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cried ſhe (entering at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, agreeable to the plan concerted) She <hi>is</hi> arrived—ſhe is <hi>here</hi>—ſhe is now in the preſence of her beloved Henry —ſhe now offers him the hand of Emma for EVER!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0149005103:121"/>Emma was yet in her boy's apparel, but had waſhed the ſtain from her lovely countenance, and diſcovered enough to throw Henry firſt upon his knee to the reſtoring God, and then into arms of this tendereſt of women.</p>
               <p>You will not expect I ſhould tell you what <hi>either</hi> felt at that moment! You will not expect I ſhould deſcribe the ſeries of delicious ſorrow and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations which followed, while all the enterprizes of Emma were relating to Henry.

                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0149005103:122"/>—in ſhort, it was a falſe rumour you ſee that reached Emma at John's-Town, reſpecting the death of Henry. He was reſerved for Emma to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and to reſtore.</p>
               <p>He is diſcovered, he is reſtored.—Emma is now before him—Emma the moſt generous, moſt—</p>

               <p>THE bleſſings of Providence are at length manifeſt; ſince the pacquet from Henry, muſt, ere this, be come to hand. It is not eaſy to tell

you how totally I have in <hi>them</hi> anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated <hi>myſelf,</hi> for many days paſt. Henry recovers apace. The attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Emma, indeed, ſo pointed and ſo pure, might almoſt raiſe him from the dead. Yet I almoſt envy her the ſhare ſhe has had in this diſcovery, and all its happy conſequences. I can ſcarce forgive my illneſs for ſeizing me at ſuch a time. It is Emma alone who has been the ſaviour of Henry. It is Henry only who can merit ſuch ſalvation. You can image to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nothing ſo tender as his gratitude, ſo warm as his affections, or ſo perfect as his delicacy. From his ſomewhat military ſtyle of addreſs I expected not this, and am equally ſurpriſed and delighted. Yes, my dear old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0149005103:125"/>
you have yet a daughter, and will, in a few days, boaſt alſo—</p>
               <p>Oh my friend, how infinitely I fall beneath the ſtandard of my ambition! How incorrect is human virtue! How frail is human fortitude! The proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Henry's becoming your SON, does not charm this rebel heart half ſo ſincerely as it ought to do; and yet, heaven is witneſs that I am doing every thing to advance his health and his happineſs.</p>
               <p>Self-intereſted, perhaps, ſtill. I doat on promoting the felicity of Emma by any means. I am proud to pleaſe her. I conſider the youth of Henry, and wiſh it the joys it is formed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0149005103:126"/>
to taſte. I reflect on my own age, and think that I am too ſilly to be pardoned. I am entirely convinced of my folly, and yet hug it to my heart. Ah Mr. Corbett, what is there in that ſubtle and active principle which we thus feed in our boſoms, and which turns, ſerpent-like, againſt the nouriſher? It ſtings, and we are not angry: it tortures, and we do not, <hi>cannot</hi> command it to depart from us. Something, like the healing balm, flows into the wound, and recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us for all we ſuffer. The miſery which is the conſequence of a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs like mine, is compounded of ſuch ſweet ingredients, that it is not in the nature of the tender heart to wiſh it were removed. And yet, my friend,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0149005103:127"/>
it is moſt intenſe. I have found the vanity of attempting to argue myſelf into neutrality. It is virtue and beauty that have attracted—that have bound me! Ere a ſoul like mine can free itſelf from <hi>ſuch</hi> captivity, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting powers of its object muſt change; its beauty become defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and its virtue vice. 'Tis out of the queſtion. The great point of moral propriety is in every man's power, and conſequently in mine. The human heart loves as it liſteth—it ſees its bias, and trembles towards it: but ſociety, religion, and the laws, are all to be reſpected, and he who preſumes to overleap theſe, renders himſelf contemptible.

               <head>TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</head>
               <p>OH my friend, receive the tribute of my ſympathy. Generous man! what can I do to ſoften the woes
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0149005103:135"/>
of which I am unhappily the cauſe? Invent, I beſeech you, ſome reaſon to abſent yourſelf on the morrow. Call to your aid ſome pious diſguiſe to ſave yourſelf and me ten thouſand wounds. Your preſence will wholly deſtroy the bliſs of the day—even of that day which gives to me the hand of Henry. Indeed it will. I ſee your emotions. I ſee your conflicts. They eſcape your ſoul's moſt amiable effort. They break through your boſom. I ſee them in your tears. I feel them in your ſighs. For my ſake—for your own—for Heaven's—do not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue longer, <hi>much</hi> longer under our roof. I eſteem you ſo truly that I cannot bear the conſtraint which will ſoon be impoſed. Your virtues have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0149005103:136"/>
placed you in the ſecond place of my affections—the ſecond place is <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and that is yours while I can diſtinguiſh—while I can feel one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſenſation. But oh conſider, that the firſt place is <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is Henry's—Henry my <hi>almoſt</hi> huſband.</p>
               <p>He preſſes, he importunes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in all the emphaſis of tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulment, that to-morrow may be the day. He almoſt chides me for cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſentiment towards him.</p>
               <p>—Alas, my dear friend, it is your ſorrows, painted in <hi>your</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and in your late converſation when we have been together, which produces this grateful reluctance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0149005103:137"/>I owe you—ah what do I <hi>not</hi> owe you? I would do much—I would do every thing that is <hi>poſſible</hi> to ſerve you.</p>
               <p>The billet you ſent me this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cuts me deeply. You there hint your deſign to leave Philadelphia.—</p>
               <p>I perceive the motive; nay, you diſdain diſguiſe, and have in part avowed it. All but this, you ſay, you can ſupport.—My dear, dear friend —author of many a comfort—ſoother of many a care—what would I give, had no accident of life produced in your gentle breaſt theſe ſentiments for Emma.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0149005103:138"/>Hitherto all has been well—all has been great and glorious. You ſtill aſſure me you can act the only part that remains. Of that I am not to be told. Yet your friendſhip is attended by ſo much ſuffering, ſo much pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſenſbility, that even at this bleſt moment my heart bleeds for you.</p>
               <p>If you will—oh hard requeſt—if you will gently withdraw yourſelf for a time only, till you have gained com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, I will defer—I will frame ſome freſh excuſes to Henry for my—</p>
               <p>Pity me, Sir Robert, and ſave us both the pangs of an explanation. It will, perhaps, not be in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to correſpond in <hi>this</hi> way any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0149005103:139"/>
more. I know your friendſhip will inſiſt upon my fulfilling to the utmoſt every duty in life, and every engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Should this, therefore, be the laſt letter that paſſes between us, I conjure you to believe, that of every petition, of every fervent prayer that I offer to heaven, your health and your happineſs will form a part. I did not think it poſſible that any thing could fall out to make me wretched, with the immediate proſpect of being united to Henry; and yet ſuch is my genuine eſteem for you, Sir Robert, that I cannot be perfectly happy while I am conſcious of creating miſery to one of the nobleſt of mankind. Henry enters, and I can ſay no more.</p>

Unkind! Your ſervant brings word too that you now lie ſick at your apartment: yet that you reſolve to depart on a tour the inſtant you can bear to be removed. This muſt not be. Emma has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laved the nuptials becauſe ſhe was too much harraſſed in ſpirits. And now I will myſelf put them back a little, that they may not want the ornament

Yes; I will defer even the poſſeſſion of Emma, till her moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous protector is able to ſanctify the union by his preſence. You keep your chamber, it ſeems.

               <p>Corbett, what can be the reaſon of it? At the cloſe of the laſt ſentence I went into my chamber in order to go to bed, but I ſat myſelf down in a chair by the ſide of it, and have not attempted to undreſs, though the day-light is beginning to dawn upon me. A thouſand half-form'd images have been teazing me. I am about fourteen miles from that Philadelphia which now contains the lovelieſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I ever beheld.

               <p>I RECEIVED your congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I received your bleſſing; and to crown the <hi>whole</hi> of human happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I have received the hand of your daughter. Yet my tranſport has hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me into an expreſſion too bold. Oh I am a mortal ſtill, Mr. Corbett: ſtill am I vulnerable in a vital part. The fearful accounts you have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of my poor ſiſter, and of your <hi>own</hi> declining health, alarm and wound me. Hapleſs Louiſa! dear relict of the generous Edward! Ah that we had you both here, nurſed by our care, and protected under the ſhelter of our moſt affectionate emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0149005103:150"/>
Sir Robert Raymond too, our ſecond father, and our firſt of friends, would rejoice at this. Yet <hi>he</hi> keeps aloof from us. He uſed to be enamoured of our ſociety, and now the deepeſt ſolitudes have ſeduced him from us. In vain I invite, in vain I implore. He is melancholy: he is mournful. Is there a cauſe for this? Ah that I could remove it! I have now been ſix weeks in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Emma Corbett. She is my wife! God of Heaven how I thrill with gratitude! Yet oh, Supreme Beſtower of every good, if it were thy divine pleaſure to reſtore my ſiſter and my friends—if it be conſiſtent with that awful deſign into whoſe depths I preſume not to pry, to extend to <hi>theſe</hi>

a portion of that felicity thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Emma and to me, the meaſure of my bliſs will be full <hi>indeed!</hi> I am ſoothed by the prayer.

               <head>TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.</head>
               <p>I HAVE brought my pulſes to be almoſt as obedient as I wiſh them. Reaſon is not ſo weak a power as we make her appear. Her province is perhaps, miſunderſtood, my friend. It is not tyranny, but a mild and <hi>genial</hi> authority, which ſhe ſhould exerciſe. The ſubjects of her ſway are the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; thoſe of the <hi>tender</hi> kind are with the moſt difficulty governed.</p>
               <p>I have applied to this our intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſovereign on a different principle. I implored her, not to inſpire me with that <hi>indifference</hi> which is the uſual prayer of the diſappointed. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0149005103:153"/>
of my love is married to the man of her heart. She obtained him at the price of almoſt unparalleled hazards. I ſaw every hope of poſſeſſion cut off. It was an intolerable agony. I bore it till I became almoſt deſperate. I indulged the paſſion even till the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble bonds were tied againſt me. I ſaw the madneſs of my purſuit, and retired—retired, my dear Corbett, not to meditate revenge againſt a happy rival, but to manage my own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and to <hi>think.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſerious appeal from the paſſions to the judgment is ſeldom made in vain. We miſcarry, chiefly becauſe we are <hi>not</hi> ſerious, but only <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> ourſelves ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0149005103:154"/>I ſelected a quiet hour, and laid the ſimple facts before me. They were not elaborate. The woman of my affection (thus I argued) is now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily married. She is generous enough to pity and reſpect me for miſery that ſhe hath very unwillingly occaſioned. Accidents have confirmed what Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett at firſt betrayed. I have too much contributed to her preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for her to treat me untenderly: and yet my farther intimacy will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her diſtreſs, even if it does not ſpread itſelf in time to her huſband. How bitterly does ſhe pay for my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſervices! What hinders her, now that ſhe is in the arms of Henry, from looking upon my paſſion as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting and impious? Thoſe very
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0149005103:155"/>
ſervices. Do I then preſume, and perſecute her upon theſe? Oh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicacy! oh folly!</p>
               <p>But can I conquer my affection? No. It is not poſſible; it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. To <hi>extinguiſh bad</hi> paſſions, and to <hi>regulate good</hi> ones, are the two great points within the compaſs of reaſon. To covet any longer the <hi>perſon</hi> of Emma would be infamous. It is an inhibition of law, of religion, and of God. But, are the merely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual paſſions then at my age ſo very groſs, that by no exertion, no intereſt, I can ſubdue them? What will be the conſequence of my perſiſting? The diſtreſs of Emma, who now ſhould taſte only of joy, the ſuſpicion of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0149005103:156"/>
Henry, whoſe heart melts in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards me, and my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious upbraiding. Can I <hi>ſuſtain</hi> theſe, or is an obſtinate attachment to the only point which reaſon refuſes me (and which, after all, is hopeleſs,) ſtrong enough to ſupport me? But <hi>what</hi> then am I to do? Does reaſon bring with her no compenſations—no equipoiſe of rewards for puniſhments ſo ſevere? She does, and MANY. Shall I not rank amongſt thoſe the delights of a friendſhip not leſs <hi>tender</hi> though leſs <hi>intereſted</hi>—the <hi>ſecret</hi>-breathed prayer for one human being whoſe happineſs is dearer to <hi>me</hi> than that of any other upon the earth—the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſigh—the ſoftening tear—the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſmile—the ſelf-gratulation—the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0149005103:157"/>
fluſh of virtue, pleaſed with <hi>herſelf</hi>—the ſmile of Emma—the aſſent of HEAVEN?</p>
               <p>Oh Mr. Corbett, we have glorious faculties, had we the reſolution to exert them. We are afraid to <hi>begin.</hi> The heart trembles at a view of its labour. We venture to climb the ſteep, and are diſmayed. But every difficulty of ſoul and body diminiſhes by earneſt perſeverance. However cragged the mountain, or ſlippery its path, every effort brings us nearer to the ſummit; the ſecond ſtep is eaſier than the firſt, the third is ſmoother than the ſecond. It is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude. When the motive is <hi>ſo great</hi> as to concern the happineſs of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0149005103:158"/>
others, and our own duty is included, ſurely we ſhould ſtruggle to aſcend. <hi>I,</hi> Corbett, <hi>have</hi> ſtruggled—I cannot ſay how much or how long, but I can and do tell you, in the ſincerity of my ſoul, that though I am not, nor perhaps ſhall EVER be again a <hi>happy</hi> man, I do not wiſh either the death of Henry, or the alienation of his Emma's affection. I can ſupport the preſence of both, when ſoftneſs and wedded love ſits <hi>faireſt</hi> upon their features. And, tho' many a riſing tear warns me that it is time to retire, no ſentiment of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular deſire invades my heart. Henry cultivates my friendſhip with kindeſt care; I do not impute to him, his <hi>happineſs</hi> as his <hi>fault.</hi> I recede not from his embrace, though I ſeldom
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0149005103:159"/>
make advances to converſation that relates to Emma: and yet Emma is his perpetual ſubject, and his darling theme. Her own conduct is ſuch as correſponds with every part of her former life. Perhaps there never was a more affecting ſituation than ſhe has to perform whenever I am preſent. It is indeed too much for a nature ſo gentle, and ſo ingenuous. But I will remove the effect, by removing the cauſe. Humanity ſhould not <hi>preſume</hi> to be perfect. I have carried a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt as far, perhaps, as it can go. I have acquired ſtrength by an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of weakneſs. Let me not ſink into captivity by fool-hardineſs. I have done much. In attempting more, I may loſe all the laurels I have
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0149005103:160"/>
won. Involuntary thoughts will treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs on the firmeſt mind. Emma is a tender wife, a tender friend.

He has juſt kiſſed my cheek: he felt it wet, and wiped off the tear. If I write legibly, come directly, and tell him that I am out of all danger: tell him that the venom is all extracted: that the preſent appearances are only the natural effects of a ſtubborn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion paſſing away: that I ſhall ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily recover.

O, Sir Robert, (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he) you are now a witneſs to my joy. I feel nothing of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. I am quite well: bear the tidings to my wife.

               <head>LETTER CXLIII.</head>
               <head>TO FREDERICK BERKLEY, ESQ.</head>
               <p>THE incloſed rough draft of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will enable you, O, my friend, to trace the veſtiges of ſome unhappy human beings ſince their departure from London to their return.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0149005103:189"/>At preſent, fortune ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our wretchedneſs by means the moſt complicate and inventive.</p>
               <p>Two hours ago we arrived at the houſe of the unfortunate Corbett. It was with the utmoſt difficulty his daughter reached town.</p>
               <p>The firſt object that ſtruck her was a HEARSE ſtanding cloſe beſide her father's door. In the paſſage ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the undertakers bearing a coffin down ſtairs. The woe-worn Corbett was ſupported between two ſervants, to take his laſt mournful leave of the friend whoſe remains were about to be depoſited. He could not move. He had not received my letter from Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0149005103:190"/>
diſpatched three days before. It had been miſs-ſent. The letter did not come to hand till two hours after our arrival. He was not PREPARED to receive us.</p>
               <p>Our chaiſe drew up ſtill cloſer. Emma ruſhed out.—The poor old man—the daughter.—</p>
               <p>—We are not provided with a language to expreſs theſe horrors.—</p>
               <p>Almoſt an hour the child and parent remained ſpeechleſs—it was ſurpriſe and agony, at once dumb and dreadful.</p>
               <p>The hearſe waited. The coffin was placed in it, and ſhut up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0149005103:191"/>The bell is at this inſtant tolling for POOR LOUISA: The ſexton is come to tell the attendants that the clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is waiting. Wretched wife of Edward! She died diſtracted. The hearſe is driving off.</p>
               <p>What a houſe is here! Alas, it has long and truly been the houſe of mourning!</p>
               <p>Corbett and Emma are ſtill toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the next room to that in which I write. The ſervants look amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſmay.</p>
               <p>I hear, methinks, the voice of my aged aſſociate in friendſhip and in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0149005103:192"/>
I am called ſuddenly and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily.—</p>
               <p>Oh friend, oh Berkley: to what am I reſerved! A PREMATURE LABOUR has been brought on by hurry, agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fatigue. This morning's ſun ſees Emma a mother of a <hi>living</hi> child.—The poiſon ſeems not to have been in the leaſt degree communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to this precious pledge. It is a female.</p>
               <p>Alas! Emma would leap for joy at this circumſtance; ſhe would forget awhile her woes in viewing the babe whom Henry had bequeathed.—She would preſent it with ſome teſtimony of maternal tranſport to her drooping
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0149005103:193"/>
father.—But that—even Henry's off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring can no longer ſoothe—for EMMA CORBETT IS <hi>dead.</hi>—Her death inſtantly ſucceeded the pangs of the birth. It happened at midnight.—Her frame muſt have dropped in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the venom, which reſiſted the force and ſubtilty of all applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Soon—too ſoon— would the fair victim of conſtancy have ſunk to the tomb; but theſe precipitating agonies added to the reſt:—Oh they were too much. She fell before them.</p>
               <p>In the expiring moment ſhe called me to her—"'Tis Emma's infant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take it, ſaid ſhe: it is a parting gift—I <hi>can</hi> no more—my father—my poor father!"—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0149005103:194"/>She dropped upon the pillow, from which ſhe twice vainly endeavoured to raiſe her head, and lift her eye to the objects about her—THEN BREATHED HER LAST.</p>
               <p>Thus lived, and thus died, the moſt faithful and beautiful of women.</p>
               <p>Charles Corbett ſtands fixed over the corpſe of his daughter.</p>
               <p>The old man is now bereft of all! "I am childleſs, Sir Robert, (he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims)—Behold what CIVIL WAR has done for me."—</p>
               <p>Berkley, I have kiſſed the clay-cold lips—I have preſſed the clay-cold
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0149005103:195"/>
hand. On that bed—that very bed—</p>
               <p>—but I dare not indulge reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Pierced</hi> as I am, I would fain preſerve a decent ſorrow. Ah that I were in my grave! Impious wiſh! Is there a ſingle point of ſpace in the petty allotment of man, in which ſomething important is not to be done?</p>
               <p>Yon aged forlorn one, now weeping over his child, looks up to me alone for ſomething which reſembles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, during the wretched reſidue of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0149005103:196"/>The funeral obſequies of Emma are yet to be performed—</p>
               <p>The widow of Edward hath left a ſon—</p>
               <p>The widow of Henry a daughter—</p>
               <p>I will not die till Heaven's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour: I have much occaſion ſtill for life.</p>

               <head>TO THE SAME.</head>
               <p>I AM juſt come from the moſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing ceremony, oh Frederick, that can poſſibly paſs under the eye of man!—May you never feel what otherwiſe you can never know! Eaſy in your fortunes, quiet in your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unconnected in your intereſts, you can, happily for you, have no conception—at leaſt no perfect one—of that rend in the heart which is made by death, when youth, innocence, and beauty, is committed to the duſt—when the parent hangs his drooping head over the laſt ſad tenement—when the orphans—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0149005103:198"/>Whatever I ſaid? Youth, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and beauty!—and do <hi>all</hi> theſe then go down to the earth's cold bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom? Shall none of them aſcend? The glooms of the ſoul almoſt carry ſenſation into ſin! They ſhall ALL aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend! The <hi>one</hi> ſhall enſure everlaſting exiſtence to the <hi>others.</hi> Innocence ſhall immortalize beauty and youth.</p>
               <p>I am reaſoning with an almoſt breaking heart, Berkley; while poor old Corbett, the ſurvivor of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in all the ſolemn pathos of grief, forgets every pain of body in nurſing that which is ſeated within. The ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of youth may teach you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I ſhould execrate—that I ſhould ſummon to my aſſiſtance every
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0149005103:199"/>
infernal power—that I ſhould tax heaven itſelf with cruelty, and take refuge from altercating man, amidſt the friendly concealment of impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable woods. This may, perhaps, anſwer the purpoſe of the novelliſt, but it correſponds not with the nature of your friend. No, Berkley. It is not in a moment like this that the truly touched and truly tender indulge themſelves in outrage. The firſt burſt is paſt: that which began with loudneſs, with vehemence, and with vociferation, ſettles into the ſtill, the ſolemn, and the affecting. The temper, ſtormy and headſtrong, of Corbett himſelf, terminates in the eloquence of dumb diſtreſs. The tears fall faſt from me as I write.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0149005103:200"/>
More <hi>impetuous</hi> periods I have felt ſo <hi>awful</hi> and ſo <hi>affecting</hi> a criſis never did I experience. You, who knew not Emma, and have not a regular though you have a worthy heart, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know what I have loſt. The manner of her death—the motive—and the whole tenour of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces connected with it, throw over every paſſage of the ſcene, a colour ſo movingly ſad, that I ſit wonder-ſtruck in the room, and ſeem almoſt in my grave, with the world about me. I have exerted myſelf to ſay thus much at the winding up of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn cataſtrophe, leſt you, my dear Barkley, or any other perſon, into whoſe hands theſe incidents may fall, ſhould preſume to queſtion the ways
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0149005103:201"/>
of ALMIGHTY GOD, which are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in every part of this pathetic ſtory. Erroneous notions of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reward, are perhaps the leading ſteps to irreligion and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The vile herd of novelliſts have done an eſſential injury to the cauſe of virtue, by ſacrificing to the pleaſure of the reader, beyond the ſimplicity of truth. Difficulty, in the beginning of a narrative; love, in the middle; and marriages, at the end, make up, almoſt invariably, the recipe of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern romance. This is called reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtue; a bad character or two, perhaps, drops off, and that is called puniſhing vice. Falſe, fooliſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion! Look into life. Doth not heaven's bleſſed beam ſhine equally
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0149005103:202"/>
on the juſt and the unjuſt. Are all rewards ſo mechanically contrived? Hath virtue no joys of her <hi>own?</hi>—joys, which generous ſorrow only can produce? Is the ſacred ſtruggle of a good man <hi>altogether afflictive?</hi> To paſs through a road perplexed and thorny—to travel through a hard and difficult life, without tearing the finer principles from the heart, doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no better conduct than moves in the machinery of thoſe contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pages where all is given up to letter'd art, and diſtorted imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Are there no ſweets in the penſive ſigh—the pious tear? Break they from the mourner without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>any</hi> balm? Hath heaven-born conſtancy no comforts? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0149005103:203"/>
the life of Emma! Hath death, at once virtuous and chriſtian, nothing to lift the ſurvivor's ſpirit above every care of vulgar being? Oh Frederick, I am touched by a very tender exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In lamenting as I <hi>now</hi> lament, ſay my friend, is there <hi>no</hi> dear and welcome mitigations? Yes, I feel—I <hi>feel</hi> that there are. Would I part with this generous grief?—Ah no! What would I take in exchange?—The univerſe ſhould not buy it from me. I even anticipate the holy ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction when I ſhall ſteal from the ſhout and ſtrife of ſociety, to the tomb of a virtuous woman. Think you I love her leſs becauſe I no more ſhall ſee her? Hath ſhe ſuffered in my eſteem <hi>by her aſcenſion into heaven?</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0149005103:204"/>
Shall ſhe loſe as an angel, what as a mortal ſhe acquired? I love her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Omnipotent placed her in the path of my life, to fix and concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the beſt of paſſions. I am not of diſpoſition or age to change again. Oh that the daughter of Emma may live! Shall I be content with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's <hi>common</hi> duty—to cloathe, to feed, to educate? Conſider Barkley, <hi>whoſe</hi> babe it is!</p>
               <p>I have hurried down ſtairs to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my treaſure!</p>
               <p>—it lives, it ſleeps. I have felt its gentle breath on my cheek.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0149005103:205"/>God will ſpare it. <hi>Louiſa</hi>'s orphan too is mine. <hi>Corbett</hi> too ſhall live. I have moved towards his bed-ſide often, ſince I began to write. His face is hid—he will not yet endure exiſtence, but the hours of reſignation are at hand.</p>
               <p>I conjure you then Berkley to <hi>ſettle</hi> your opinions about Providence.—Bring your piety to a point.—Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate your tenderneſs.—Love, like Emma; and if you meet with <hi>ſuch</hi> a diſappointment, do not <hi>transfer</hi> your affection, but turn it to a generous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The <hi>vulgar</hi> effect of tender diſtreſs, is diſſipation or deſpair. Had <hi>I</hi> yielded to theſe, a poor old man would have wanted a friend;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0149005103:206"/>
two lovely infants, a parent; and I the ſelf-approving <hi>boſom-ray,</hi> which chears my ſpirit in this vale of ſorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Circumſcribe</hi> not, therefore, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Heaven. The writer of a romance would paint me as a wretch without hope, who calls down the ſtroke of fate in pity to his aid.
