            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ſuppoſed <hi>opinion</hi> of Mr. Hatſell, (in his <q>

               </q> under the title of <q>
                  <hi>King calls the Parliament,</hi>
               </q>) as compendiouſly ſtated by my worthy and very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend, Mr. Lofft, in p. 5 of his Obſervations, is a much more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtruction than Mr. Hatſell's <hi>own words</hi> can really warrant; though all perſons, who are acquainted with that gentleman's very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable character, (including the writer of this remark,) have reaſon to wiſh, for his ſake, that his <hi>opinion</hi> (whatever it may be) had been ſo expreſſed as to be really limited by the moderate and very friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which Mr. Lofft has put upon it. Mr. Lofft ſuppoſes the <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of Mr. Hatſell to be, that <q>
                  <hi>the intent of the ſtatutes of Edward, and the ancient law and conſtitution of the kingdom, require parliaments to</hi> SIT <hi>once at leaſt in every year, but</hi> NOT <hi>that they ſhould be</hi> ANNUALLY, OR OFTENER, ELECTED;</q> but Mr. Hatſell himſelf, if we may judge by his manner of writing, is far from admitting that <hi>the conſtitution requires parliaments</hi> even <hi>to</hi> SIT once a year, or that <q>
                  <hi>the king is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to call a parliament once at leaſt in every year;</hi>
               </q> for this he has contemptuouſly treated merely as <hi>'a notion'</hi> (that) <q>

                  <hi>thoſe perſons, who maintain</hi> THIS DOCTRINE,</q> (i. e. the doctrine laſt cited in his own words, as a <hi>general</hi> doctrine, having two different accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ariſing from the 4th and 36th Edward III.) <hi>'do not mean'</hi> (ſays he) <q>
                  <hi>that, according to theſe ſtatutes,</hi> A SESSION <hi>of parliament ſhall be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den every year, but that</hi> A NEW ELECTION ſhall be had, &amp;c.</q>— In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which, it may be ſufficient to oppoſe one eminent example for all: viz. that the learned commentator, Judge Blackſtone, notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied, as well as himſelf, that the <hi>latter</hi> doctrine <hi>'ever was'</hi> the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of thoſe ancient ſtatutes, though he actually was one of <q>

II. m. 28, intus; that <hi>"upon a petition to the king,"</hi> (K. Edw. II.) '<hi>he granted that</hi> "SEMEL IN ANNO TENEATUR <hi>parliamentum,"</hi> &amp;c. whence it is evident, that the act of 4 Edw. III. c. 14, was not a <hi>new</hi> law, but a declaration of the <hi>old</hi> conſtitution, viz. <q>
                  <hi>That a parliament ſhall be holden every year once, and more often if need be;</hi>
               </q> which was again confirmed by ſtatute in the 36 Ed. III. c. 10. And the USAGE of thoſe times (proved by the <hi>writs iſſued for general elections</hi> frequently <q>MORE OFTEN</q> than 'ONCE' in a year) excludes all <hi>'doubtful'</hi>-neſs from theſe ancient ſtatutes; ſo that <hi>new</hi> parliaments muſt neceſſarily have been underſtood, until (by the traverſe of modern acts) they became applicable only to the <hi>annual ſitting</hi> of parliament.</p>
            <p>The oppoſers of the original meaning (viz for <hi>annual elections,</hi> and <hi>more often</hi>) have rendered that conſtruction ſtill more obvious by their own miſerable ſhifts to evade it! One ſays, — the words are <q>
                  <hi>looſe and vague,</hi>
               </q> though ſuch a charge is applicable only to his own <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatical</hi> conſtruction; and another would render the acts <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> by boldly excluding the only juſt criterion for <q>
                  <hi>clearing up doubts</hi>
               </q> in ſuch a caſe, viz. the USAGE <hi>of the times in which the acts were made;</hi> and, inſtead of it, would have us refer ONLY to <q>

               </q> and to <hi>'the opinion'</hi> of perſons who lived from 200 to 400 years after thoſe times! But the propoſer ſeems not to be aware, that this mode of <hi>'explaining ancient ſtatutes'</hi> is exactly ſimilar to one of the moſt groſs and deluſive practices of <hi>popery!</hi> The apoſtate church of Rome, for obvious reaſons, cannot ſubmit the determination of what ought to be eſteemed <hi>apoſtolic doctrine</hi> to the evidence of <hi>apoſtolic
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1125600600:5"/>times;</hi> and, of courſe, ſhe is driven to this wretched ſubterfuge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring for evidence (in favour of her <hi>innovations</hi> and unſcriptural prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices) to the traditions of <hi>more modern times,</hi> and to the <hi>practices</hi> and <hi>opinions</hi> of perſons who lived from 200 to 400 years afterwards; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to invalidate <hi>all cotemporary evidence</hi> of <hi>facts</hi> and <hi>primitive uſages.</hi> — And ſurely this diſhoneſt and arbitrary mode of <hi>'ſettling doubts'</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unjuſtifiable in <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>political,</hi> as in <hi>religious,</hi> queſtions. Yet Mr. Hatſell boldly ventures to tell us that, <q>
                  <hi>where the expreſſions of acts of parliament,</hi>
               </q> (ſpeaking of the acts of Edward,) <q>

               </q> (P. 198, n.) Thus, even the commencement of the time, here propoſed as <hi>the beſt</hi> for afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing information, is actually more than two hundred years AFTER <hi>the times</hi> in which the acts were made; and he cuts off all <hi>cotemporary,</hi> as well as <hi>intermediate, evidence,</hi> by a ſingle bold aſſertion, that <q>
                  <hi>nothing can clear up —but,</hi>

James I. — <hi>'an intermiſſion of parliaments for twelve years' together,</hi> by K. Charles I. Theſe were ſurely moſt unpropitious times for <hi>parliamentary knowledge;</hi> and Mr. Hatſell does not ſeem to be aware, that the fear of ſimilar <hi>intermiſſions</hi> was probably the principal cauſe which withheld the patriots of thoſe days from urging their <hi>election-rights</hi> at a time when the ſum total of all their <hi>rights</hi> was at ſtake, even <hi>the right to have any parliament at all!</hi> ſo that their <hi>ſilence</hi> reſpecting <hi>annua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> deſign</hi> of the ingenious author to promote a mode of <hi>explaining ancient ſtatutes</hi> ſo dangerouſly preſumptuous and arbitrary! And, to juſtify the more moderate concluſion of the two, he has luckily furniſhed me with an eaſy and obvious proof of it in the very next chapter but one, to which he has given the running title of— <q>
                  <hi>King adjourns the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               </q> — <hi>'King adjourns the Parliament,'</hi> — for ſeveral pages together, (i. e. from 204 to 211.) ſo that that one would naturally ſuppoſe that <hi>he really meant what he had ſo often written:</hi> but, at length, (though not till the very laſt page of that head,) he kindly guards us againſt that baneful error by an explicit ſtating of what HE HIMSELF believes to be <q>
                  <hi>the true parliamentary doctrine,</hi>
               </q> viz. <q>
                  <hi>That the king has no authority to adjourn the parliament;</hi>
               </q> and, of courſe, his <hi>'ſuperficial manner'</hi> of expreſſing himſelf (I mean on this particular head) muſt be corrected, in his next edition, to <hi>'the true parliamentary doctrine,'</hi> — <q>
                  <hi>King does</hi> NOT <hi>adjourn the Parliament:</hi> —</q> ſo that he muſt put <hi>a negative</hi> upon his preſent <hi>title</hi> throughout all theſe pages!</p>
            <p>But, to return to my ſubject, I truſt that the neceſſity of at leaſt ONE SITTING of the parliament every year, and of our <hi>national right</hi> to ſuch SITTING, is ſo ſufficiently underſtood and acknowledged, by the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity even of <hi>all parties,</hi> that THE CONTRARY DOCTRINE, which ariſes too apparently from Mr. Hatſell's <hi>manner of treating</hi> the king's prerogative on that ſubject, will need no particular refutation: and yet ſo reſpectable is the authority of the writer, (not only by his office of <hi>clerk of the houſe of commons,</hi> but alſo by the perſonal eſteem which is certainly due to him from a very numerous and reſpectable body of friends and acquaintance,) that I thought myſelf obliged to take ſome notice of <hi>his manner of treating</hi> the ſubject before us, in order to warn the public againſt <hi>a poſſible</hi> conſtruction of it which might hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (if not ſeaſonably cenſured) have dangerous conſequences. At the ſame time I ſincerely profeſs, that my cenſure is aimed more at this gentleman's <hi>manner of writing</hi> than his <hi>intention,</hi> and that I am much more willing to believe that <hi>the opinion he intended</hi> to expreſs was truly what Mr. Lofft has <hi>ſuppoſed;</hi> or that I myſelf may perhaps be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in conceiving that his words are liable to a different conſtruction; rather than to ſuſpect that the worthy clerk of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons could <hi>really intend</hi> to favour a doctrine which is repugnant to the eſtabliſhed <hi>uſage of parliament</hi> for near a century, and is <hi>equally</hi> inimical to the juſt privileges of the <hi>Lords</hi> as to thoſe of the <hi>Commons,</hi> and, of courſe, to the welfare of the <hi>whole nation.</hi>
