            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I longed to ſee you, Sir—you are allied to a worthy young man—but I am afraid that by viſiting me you will involve yourſelf in a danger you are not aware of—in the ruin of a man proſcribed.—If a real criminal is puniſhed, he will ſoon be forgotten, but if a man of blameleſs integrity is injured, he will be perſecuted with unrelenting hatred, for the very mention of his name is a ſatire on the times, and his exiſtence is to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his enemies an unceaſing remembrancer of guilt.</p>

               <p>But ought that conſideration to check the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ardour of a ſoldier? the pooreſt penſioner in this charity has his moments of exultation when he recollects he has fought bravely.</p>

               <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
               <p>True, a love of glory is a noble paſſion!—but do you think the pleaſure that ſprings from conqueſt has a ſincere and laſting charm in it?—Alas! when a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of human blood bids the tears of natural affection flow in rivers round the land, can the mind in that ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation taſte of joy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Live.</speaker>
               <p>Never.—Yet ſurely when this blood is ſpilt in their defence, of whom nature intended us the guardians, though our ſenſibility may be ſhocked, our honour can never be ſtained.—In my mind, defence and repriſals are the only juſtifiable meaſures in war, while ambition is but another name for maſſacre.</p>

               <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
               <p>You have diſtinguiſhed right.—But in your purſuits after fame you will have a worſe enemy to guard againſt than ambition—Envy!—which when you have done your duty, will make even accidents a ground of impeachment againſt you.—Have you done all that was poſſible?—You ought to have done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—The charge is aggravated, and the good you have done dwindles into nothing—your downfall is effected, and ſome worthleſs wretch is ſure to riſe upon your ruins.</p>
