            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>'TWAS told you in a former lay,</l>
               <l>How on a luckleſs evil day</l>
               <l>The Trader John, a landſman brave,</l>
               <l>Left the dry ground to try the wave.</l>
               <l>But here the poet muſt rehearſe,</l>
               <l>In ſoft, and ſweet, and tender verſe,</l>
               <l>How gentle Johnny had a wife,</l>
               <l>The joy and ſolace of his life,</l>
               <l>The ſharer of his griefs and cares,</l>
               <l>Privy to all his great affairs;</l>
               <l>One who when ty'd in wedlock's nooſe</l>
               <l>Had prov'd a helpmate ſit for uſe;</l>
               <l>One whom he married—not for whim—</l>
               <l>But who could keep his houſe in trim;</l>
               <l>No high-ſlown miſs, or Belle, or Beauty,</l>
               <l>A ſimple Girl that knew her duty;</l>
               <l>Had well obey'd her Father, Mother,</l>
               <l>And counſell'd well her younger Brother;</l>
               <l>Healthy when young, and rather ſtout:</l>
               <l>Moral?—nay more, ſhe was devout:</l>
               <l>And now a Chriſtian quite at heart,</l>
               <l>She carefully fulfils her part,</l>
               <l>Well ſkill'd alike her houſe to guide,</l>

               <l>John knows her worth, and now-a-days,</l>

A Maiden ſhe of ſpotleſs fame,</l>
               <l>E'en in her mirth quite clear from blame.</l>
               <l>Train'd in Religion's "narrow way,"</l>
               <l>Her mind untainted by a Play,</l>
               <l>She hates your giddy glitt'ring ſcenes,</l>
               <l>Tho' long ſince enter'd on her teens;</l>
               <l>Sees all things in a proper light,</l>
               <l>And vice quite puts her in a fright;</l>
               <l>Prompt and obedient from a Child,</l>
               <l>Obliging, humble, meek and mild;</l>
               <l>Still, before ſtrangers, as a mouſe;</l>

               <l>There, like ſome flower both ſweet and gay,</l>
               <l>She ſhuns as yet the blaze of day;</l>
               <l>(Well does her praiſe adorn my tale)</l>

               <l>Fine mid-night Routs, and public Places,</l>
               <l>And wonder how ſhe can endure,</l>

               <l>Extol her form, her piercing Eyes,</l>
               <l>And tell a hundred flatt'ring lies;</l>

               <l>The tortur'd Maiden bites her lips;</l>
               <l>Thinks his fine flatt'ry mere pretence,</l>
               <l>And longs to tell him to talk ſenſe;</l>
