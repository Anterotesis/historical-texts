            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Sheets are a few of that vaſt Number of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> which are held by the Common People; ſuch as they ſolely or generally obſerve. For tho' ſome of them have been of National and others perhaps of univerſal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, yet at preſent they would have little or no Being, if not obſerved among the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0565000600:9"/>I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the People, nor an Aboliſher of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Cuſtoms, which are their Pleaſures and Recreations: I aim at nothing, but a Regulation of thoſe which are in Being amongſt them, which they themſelves are far from thinking burdenſome, and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſuch only as are ſinful and wicked.</p>
            <p>Some of the Cuſtoms they hold, have been originally good, tho' at preſent they retain little of their primitive Purity; the true Meaning and Deſign of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either loſt, or very much in the Dark through Folly and Superſtition. To wipe off therefore the Duſt they have contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to clear them of Superſtition, and make known their End and Deſign, may turn to ſome Account, and be of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; whereas obſerving them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0565000600:10"/>
Way, is not only of no Advantage, but of very great Detriment.</p>
            <p>Others they hold, are really ſinful, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in outward Appearance they ſeem very harmleſs, being a Scandal to Religion, and an encouraging of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore to aim at aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, will I hope be no Crime, tho' they be the Diverſions of the People.</p>
            <p>As to the Opinions they hold, they are almoſt all ſuperſtitious, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally either the Produce of Heatheniſm; or the Inventions of indolent <hi>Monks,</hi> who having nothing elſe to do, were the Forgers of many ſilly and wicked Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to keep the World in Awe and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. And indeed the ignorant Part of the World, is ſtill ſo aw'd, that they follow the idle Traditions of the one,
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0565000600:11"/>
more than the Word of GOD; and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence, more Dread of their unlucky ones, than his Wrath and Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The regulating therefore of theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Cuſtoms, is what I propos'd by the following Compoſitions, whatever has been ſuggeſted to the contrary: And as to the Menaces of ſome, and the Cenſures of others, I neither fear nor regard them. I ſhall be always ready to own any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and in what I juſtly may, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my ſelf.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Ceremony of Tolling the Bell at the Time of Death, ſeems to be as ancient as the having of Bells themſelves; we are told, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bingham</hi>'s Orig. Eccl. Lib. 3.</note> it was about the ſeventh Century when Bells were firſt in the Church, and that venerable <hi>Bede</hi> is the firſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0565000600:21"/>
that mentions them. If this be true, then it is as true, that the Tolling of the Bell was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted about that Time; for where our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man mentions the Word <hi>Campana,</hi> or Bell, there it alſo is, that we find a Bell made uſe of for the Dead: <note n="*" place="bottom">Haec, tunc in dormitorio ſororum pauſans, exaudivit ſubito in aere notum campanae ſonum, quo ad orationes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citari vel convocati ſolebant, cum quis eorum de ſeculo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uiſſet evocatus. <hi>Bed. Eccl. Hiſt. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23.</note> For at the Death of the Abbeſs St. <hi>Hilda,</hi> he tells us that one of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of a diſtant Monaſtery, as ſhe was ſleeping, thought ſhe heard the well known Sound of that Bell, which called them to Prayers, when any of them had departed this Life. But be that as it will, it is evident, that the Bell was tolled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion about <hi>Bede</hi>'s Time, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the Ceremony is as ancient, as his Days.</p>
               <p>THE Reaſon why this Cuſtom was inſtituted, was not, as ſome ſeem to imagine, for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood, that ſuch a Perſon was dead; but chiefly, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever heard the Noiſe of the Bell, ſhould put up their Prayers for the Soul: Thus the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0565000600:22"/>
above-mentioned tells us again, <note n="†" place="bottom">Quod cum illa audiſſet, ſuſcitavit cunctas ſorores &amp; in eccleſiam convocatas, orationibus &amp; pſalmis pro anima ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris operam dare monuit. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> That ſhe who preſided in this Monaſtery, had no ſooner heard this, than ſhe raiſed all the Siſters, and called them into the Church, where ſhe exhorted them to pray fervently, and ſing a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem</hi> for the Soul of their Mother. <hi>Caſſalion</hi> alſo upon this Place of <hi>Bede,</hi> ſays, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Et talis ritus etiam de praeſenti ſervatur in <hi>Anglia,</hi> ut cum quis deceſſit, ſtatim campana propriae illius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiae ſpeciali quodam modo ſonat per aliquod temporis ſpatium.—Quamvis <hi>Angli</hi> negent modo orationes &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragia defunctis proficua; non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui percipere, quam quod talis ſonus ſit ritus antiquae eccleſiae <hi>Anglicanae, Caſſali</hi> de vet Sac.

                  <hi>the ſame Cuſtom is ſtill obſerved in</hi> England, <hi>that as ſoon as any hath departed this Life, the Bell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Pariſh he liv'd in, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately tolled, and for ſome Time.—And tho'</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the</hi> Engliſh <hi>now deny, that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead; yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Cuſtom of the old Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0565000600:23"/>AND for this Reaſon it is, that this Cuſtom was firſt obſerved, and ſhould be ſtill retain'd among us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prayers of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may be aſſiſting to the Soul; and certainly it might be more profitably retain'd, were it ſo order'd, that the Bell ſhould be tolled before the Perſon's Departure, as was undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned when this Ceremony was continued, that good Men might give him their Prayers. Was this always ſo obſerved, there might be ſome <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt the Number of the Faithful, whoſe Prayers could prevail upon GOD, to beat back <hi>the Amalekites of Darkneſs;</hi> ſome whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> might remove a <hi>Mountain of Sins,</hi> and ſome whoſe Tears procure a Multitude of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. O the Comfort of <hi>the Forgivenneſs of Sins!</hi> Of <hi>being guided ſafely through the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death!</hi> Of arriving ſecurely at the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country! What is it that Prayer can't obtain?</p>
               <p>BUT tho' the Wickedneſs and Impenitency of the dying Perſon be ſuch, as that the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Faithful will not be ſufficient to avert the Wrath and Puniſhment of a juſtly incenſed

GOD; yet as this can be only known to GOD, it will not diſcharge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy, in the moſt paſſionate and affectionate Manner. They thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the moſt laudable Zeal, the moſt diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Charity; and whilſt they are ſo ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for the Happineſs and Welfare of other Mens Souls, they cannot but be thereby influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced to have the greateſt Concern for their own, and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emulation <hi>from Strength to Strength,</hi> and endeavour as the <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. vi. 1.</note> Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, <hi>to go on to Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT, alas! we are fallen into Times of ſuch Irreligion and Prejudice, ſuch Contempt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and ſuch too great Reformation, that what with Indolence on one Hand, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance on the other; what with no Zeal on this Side, and too <note n="†" place="bottom">Among the many Objections of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> it is laid to the Charge of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That tho' we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory, and teach the contrary; yet how well our Practice ſuits with it, may be conſidered in our Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hallowed Bells for the Soul. Biſh. <hi>Hall.</hi> cont. <hi>Brown.</hi>
                  </note> falſe a one on that; we either neglect the moſt decent Ceremonies of Religion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0565000600:25"/>
or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at all. No Wonder then, that, <hi>in the Midſt of ſuch a crooked and perverſe Generation,</hi> when the moſt of Men are negligent of themſelves, they are alſo negligent of others: No Wonder, that when there is ſuch a general Contempt of Religion, and Men are careleſs of their own Souls, they are not careful for the Souls of their Friends.</p>
               <p>BUT it is called <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>In a Veſtry-Book belonging to the Chappel of</hi> All-Saints <hi>in</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>upon</hi> Tyne, <hi>it is obſerveable, That the Tolling of the Bell is not mention'd in the Pariſh Accounts, from the Year</hi> 1643, <hi>till</hi> 1655, <hi>when we find it order'd to be tolled again. At a Veſtry holden</hi> January <hi>21ſt</hi> 1655. Whereas for ſome Years paſt, the collecting of the Duty for Bell and Tolling, hath been forborn and laid aſide, which hath much leſſen'd the Revenue of the Church, by which, and ſuch like Means, it is brought into Dilapidations; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now taken the ſame into ſerious Conſideration, and fully debated the Objections made by ſome againſt the ſame, and having had the Judgment of our Miniſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any Superſtition that might be in it; which being made clear, it is this Day order'd, That from henceforth, the Church-Officer appointed thereunto, do collect the ſame, and bring the Money unto the Church-Wardens, and that thoſe who deſire to have the Uſe of the Bells, may freely have them as formerly, paying the accuſtom'd Fees. <hi>It is certain they laid it aſide, becauſe they thought it ſuperſtitious, and it is probable, if they had not wanted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they had not ſeen the contrary.</hi>

for what true Reaſon, I know not. Did we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed imagine with the Papiſts, that there is any <note n="†" place="bottom">We call them Soul-Bells, for that they ſignifie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Soul, not for that they help the Paſſage of the Soul.

But when we retain the Cuſtom, only to procure the Prayers of the Faithful for a departing Soul, it would ſurely be of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to obſerve it, if the <hi>Prayers of a righteous Man avail</hi> any Thing at all; which, if we may believe an inſpir'd Apoſtle, are of very great Efficacy and Validity.</p>
               <p>ART thou then attending a Friend in his laſt Moments? Art thou careful for his Soul, and ſollicitous for his Salvation? Doſt thou wiſh him ſafe <hi>through the Valley of Death to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Hills?</hi> Wouldſt thou have the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0565000600:27"/>
protect him, and be his <hi>Shield againſt the Powers of Darkneſs?</hi> In ſhort, wouldſt thou have him crown'd with the Joys of <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> Be aſſured then, that the Prayers of good Men will very much contribute to the gaining of theſe Things. But how ſhall they then pray for him, if they know not of his Departure? And how can they know that, without the Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Bell? Do thou therefore put in Practice this decent and profitable Cuſtom, not as our Age generally does, after the Death of thy Friend, but before it; before he leave the World, when the Prayers of good Men can aſſiſt him, and facilitate his Journey into the other Life.</p>
               <p>OR art thou <hi>working in the Field, or grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mill?</hi> Remember then, when thou heareſt the Sound of the Bell for one departing, that thou put up thy Prayers for him. Be thy Buſineſs what it will, it will always permit thee to ſay at leaſt, <hi>LORD, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace:</hi> Or to uſe the Words of St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> when he and his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were ready to be ſlain, <hi>LORD, have

               <p>BUT now it may be objected, That as the Bell is ſeldom tolled till after the Perſon's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, it is to no Purpoſe to pray for the Soul; nay to pray for it, would be praying for the Dead: And ſince that is repugnant to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

of our Church, our Prayers at that Time had much better be omitted.</p>
               <p>INDEED it is too true, this Cuſtom is not ſo common as it ſhould be; but however, it is ſo much obſerved, as will be able to vindicate the putting up of conſtant Prayers. I know ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Religious Families in this Place, and I hope it is ſo in other Places too, who always obſerve it, whenever the melancholly Seaſon offers; and therefore it will at leaſt ſometimes happen, when we put up our Prayers conſtantly at the Tolling of the Bell, that we ſhall pray for a Soul departing. And tho' it be granted, that it will oftner happen otherwiſe, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Cuſtom is ſo little followed; yet that can be no harmful praying for the Dead.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ATCHING with the Corps was an ancient Cuſtom of the Church, and every where pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. They were wont to ſit by it, from the Time of its Death till its Exportation to the Grave, either in the Houſe it died in, or in the Church it ſelf. Agreeable to this, we read in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That as they watched his Mother <hi>Monica,</hi>

               <p>HOW unlike to this ancient Cuſtom of Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the modern one, of locking up the Corps in a Room, and leaving it there alone? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to this decent Manner of Watching, is that Watching of the Vulgar, which is a Scene of Sport and Drinking and Lewdneſs? Watching at that Time with a dear Friend, is the laſt Kindneſs and Reſpect we can ſhew him; and how unfriendly is it, to change it into Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and too great Reſignation? How unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, inſtead of a becoming Sorrow and decent Gravity, to put on an unbecoming Joy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Paſtime.</p>

out, and laid down in the Grave. The going of the Corps before, ſhewed that their Friend was gone before them to the State of Death; and their following after, was as much as to ſay, that they muſt alſo in a ſhort Time fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him thither. For this Reaſon the Chriſtian alſo obſerves the Cuſtom, and may, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as he follows the Body to the Grave, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain himſelf with a pious Meditation upon it, in ſuch like Thoughts as theſe of the Pſalmiſt. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xc.—</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art GOD from Everlaſting, and World without End; Thou turneſt Man to Deſtruction; again, Thou ſayeſt, Come again ye Children of Men. For a thouſand Years in thy Sight are but as Yeſterday, ſeeing that is paſt as a Watch in the Night. As ſoon as thou ſcattereſt them, they are even as a Sleep, and fade away ſuddenly like the Graſs. In the Morning it is green and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, but in the Evening it is cut down, dried up and withered. Do thou therefore, O LORD,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxix.</note> 
                  <hi>let me know my End, and the Number of my Days, that I may be certified how long I have to live. Behold thou haſt made my Days, as it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0565000600:38"/>
were a Span long, and mine Age is nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Thee; and verily every Man living is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Vanity. And now, LORD, what is my Hope? Truly my Hope is even in Thee. Deliver me from all mine Offences, and O ſpare me a little that I may recover my Strength, before I go hence and be no more ſeen.</hi> Such Thoughts as theſe of our Friend's, and of our own Mortality, would excite us to prepare for our own Change.</p>
               <p>AND as this Form of Proceſſion is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of our dying ſhortly after our Friend, ſo the carrying of Ivy, or Laurel, or Roſemary, or ſome of thoſe Ever-Greens, is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality. It is as much as to ſay, That tho' the Body be dead, yet the Soul is Ever-Green and always in Life: It is not like the Body, and thoſe other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Seaſons, no <hi>Autumn</hi> nor <hi>Winter</hi> can make a Change in it, but it is unalterably the ſame, perpetually in Life, and never dying.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Heathens upon this Occaſion, made Uſe of Cypreſs, which being
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0565000600:39"/>
once cut, will never flouriſh nor grow any more, as an Emblem of their dying for ever, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more in Life. But inſtead of that, the ancient Chriſtians uſed the Things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; they <note n="*" place="bottom">Hadera quoque vel laurus &amp; hujuſmodi, quae ſemper ſervant virorem, in ſarchophago corpori ſubſternuntur, ad ſignificandum quod qui moriuntur in Chriſto, vivere nec deſinunt.

               <p>AND as the carrying of theſe Ever-Greens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality, ſo it is alſo of the Reſurrection of the Body: For as theſe Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up, but only cut down, and will, at the returning Seaſon, revive and ſpring up again; ſo the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, like them, is but cut down for a while, and will riſe and ſhoot up again at the Reſurrection.

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0565000600:40"/>IT was cuſtomary <note n="*" place="bottom">Greg.

Thus by theſe two ancient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, we have placed before our Eyes, our Mortality and Immortality; the one ſpeaks the Death of the Body, the other the Life of the Soul, nay, and the Life of the Body too; for like that Herb we carry, it is not quite pluck'd up, but ſhall one Day be alive again. When it hath laid in the Earth the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon, the Continuance of this World, and the Warmth and Influence of the <hi>Spring</hi> is come, the joyful Spring of the Reſurrection, it ſhall be enliven'd, and ſhoot up, and eternally flouriſh. <note n="*" place="bottom">Greg.

This was an ancient Cuſtom of the Church. For in ſome of the earlieſt Ages, they carried out their Dead to the Grave with ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns.

Joy, and are become Conquerors; which ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a Matter of no little Conſolation for the looſing of our Friend. And how becoming is it to pay ſuch Honour to the Body! How is it imitating the bleſſed Angels, who rejoyced at Meeting of the Soul, and carrying it to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For as they rejoyce <hi>at her Converſion on Earth,</hi> ſo moſt certainly they rejoyce at her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heaven. And as they rejoyce at the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of the Soul thither, ſo we, in Imitation of them, at the carrying out the Body to the Grave. They rejoyce that the Soul hath got out of a World of Sin, we that the Body out of a World of Trouble; they that the Soul can ſin no more, we that the Body can no more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; they that the Soul enjoys Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, we that the Body reſts from its Labours.</p>
               <p>WHEN therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation, and this decent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is perform'd, let it alſo have a Share of our Thoughts, and excite in us Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Thankſgiving and Praiſe. And when theſe Cuſtoms are ſo obſerved, they will be of great Advantage to us, making us ſtill fitter

And ſurely a Thing of this Good and Profit, is much to be preferr'd to what hath in it nothing but Undecency and Irreverence; ſuch is our laughing and jeſting, and telling of News, when we accompany a Neighbour to the Grave. There is indeed a Mean to be obſerved, as in all other Things, ſo in this; we muſt neither be too ſad, nor too merry; we muſt not be ſo merry as to throw off all the Signs of Affection and Love, all the Tokens of Eſteem and Humanity; nor muſt we <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. i. 4, 13.—</note>

P.</hi> 334.</note> It was a Cuſtom of the ancient Chriſtians to place Crowns of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, at the Heads of deceaſed Virgins; for which he quotes <hi>Damaſcen, Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And this hath probably been the Original of this Cuſtom among the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>THAT other Cuſtom of <hi>ſtrawing Flowers</hi> upon the <hi>Graves</hi> of their departed Friends, is alſo derived from a Cuſtom of the ancient Church. For it was uſual in thoſe Times for the common Sort of People, to ſtraw the Graves of their Friends, with various Flowers. Of this there are two notable Inſtances taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by <hi>Caſſalion,</hi> and ſeveral other Ritualiſts.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0565000600:46"/>
The one is that of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> on the Death of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Nec ego floribus tumulum ejus aſpergam, ſed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ejus Chriſti odore perfundam; ſpargant alii plenis li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia calathis: Nobis lilium eſt Chriſtus: Hoc reliquias ejus ſacrabo. <hi>Ambroſ. Orat. Funebri. de obitu Valentin.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I will not ſprinkle his Grave with Flowers, but pour on his Spirit the Odour of CHRIST. Let others ſcatter Baskets of Flowers: CHRIST is our Lilly, and with this will I conſecrate his Relicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE other is that of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Pammachius</hi> upon the Death of his Wife. <note n="†" place="bottom">Caeteri mariti ſuper tumulos conjugum ſpargunt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, roſas, lilia, floreſque purpureos, &amp; dolorem pectoris his officiis conſolantur; <hi>Pammachius</hi> noſter ſanctam favil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam oſſaque veneranda eleemoſynae balſamis rigat. <hi>Hieron. Epiſt. ad Pammachium de obitu Uxoris.</hi>
                  </note> Whilſt other Husbands ſtrawed Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and Roſes, and Lillies, and purple Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, upon the Graves of their Wives, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted themſelves with ſuch like Offices, <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machius</hi> bedew'd her Aſhes and venerable Bones, with the Balſom of Alms.</p>
               <p>NOW theſe Inſtances, tho' they juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe other Actions, and wiſely prefer them to the Ceremonies of adorning Graves with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0565000600:47"/>
Flowers: Yet they no Way decry theſe ancient Cuſtoms. Theſe lower Marks of Eſteem and Honour, which the <hi>Vulgar</hi> paid to the Remains of their Friends, were in themſelves harmleſs and innocent, and had no Cenſure; and as they were ſo, ſo ſhould the preſent Cuſtoms be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any, being full as harmleſs and innocent as the other.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E may obſerve the Generality of old People among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, as they enter into the Church, to turn their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards the <hi>Altar,</hi> and bow or kneel that Way. This, no Doubt, is the Remains of that ancient Cuſtom of the Church, of worſhipping toward the Eaſt. For in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church they worſhipped that Way upon ſeveral Accounts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That by ſo worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, they might lift up their Minds to GOD, who is called the Light and the Creator of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0565000600:49"/>
Light. And therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cum ad orationem ſtamus, ad orientem covertimur, unde caelum ſurgit, &amp;c. Ut admoneatur animus ad natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram excellentiorem ſe convertere, id eſt, ad Dominum. <hi>Aug. de Serm. Domini. in Mont.

St. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> therefore tells us, That <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Damaſc. Lib. <hi>4.</hi> C. <hi>13.</hi> Orthod. Fid.</note> becauſe the Scripture ſays, That GOD plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Paradiſe</hi> in <hi>Eden</hi> towards the Eaſt, where he <hi>placed the Man which he had formed,</hi> whom he puniſh'd with Baniſhment upon his Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and made him dwell over againſt <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in the Weſtern Part; we therefore pray, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> being in Queſt of our ancient Country; and as it were <hi>panting</hi> after it, do worſhip GOD that Way. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was uſed when any were baptized. They firſt turn'd their Faces to the Weſt, and ſo renounc'd the Devil; and then to the Eaſt, and made their Covenant with CHRIST. <hi>Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0565000600:50"/>
They prayed that Way, believing that our SAVIOUR would come to Judgment from that Quarter of the Heavens. <hi>For as the Lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth unto the Weſt, ſo ſhall the Coming of the Son of Man be; and he is to come in like Manner as he aſcended.</hi> And that he aſcended up Eaſtward from Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> St. <note n="*" place="bottom">Damaſc. Lib. <hi>4.</hi> C. <hi>13.</hi> Orthod. Fid.</note> 
                  <hi>Damaſcen</hi> aſſures us. For <hi>(ſays he)</hi> when he aſcended into Heaven, he was taken up Eaſtward, and his Diſciples worſhipped him that Way. And therefore chiefly it was, that in the ancient Church they prayed with their Faces to the Eaſt; and that many of our own Church at this Day, turn their Faces to that Quarter of the World, at the Repetition of the Creed.</p>
               <p>WHAT may more confirm this, and ſpeak it to have been the univerſal Opinion of the Church, is the ancient Cuſtom of burying the Corps, with the Feet to the Eaſt, and the Head to the Weſt; which Cuſtom is continued to this Day in the whole Church of <hi>England:</hi> This was obſerved for the ſame Reaſon, That, at the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0565000600:51"/>
the oriental Part of Heaven, our Bodies might be found in a praying Poſture, with their Faces towards the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>OUR learned Countryman <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, <q>That the holy Men of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hold a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition generally received from their Ancients, that our SAVIOUR himſelf was buried, with his Face and Feet towards the Eaſt. It is affirmed by the Geographers of the holy Land.</q> And <hi>Bede</hi> ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Introeuntes ab oriente in domum illam rotundam quae in petra exciſa eſt, viderunt angelum ſedentem ad meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianam partem loci illius, ubi poſitum fuerat corpus Jeſu; hoc enim erat in dextris, quod nimirum, corpus, quod ſupinum jacens caput habebat ad occaſum, dexteram ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe eſt habere ad auſtrum. <hi>Bed. in Dic. Sanct.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0565000600:52"/>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Adeo tenaces fuere priſci illi fideles in hoc ritu reſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi in orientem, ut non folum ipſi viventes, hoc in eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum precibus exacte ſervarent, verum etiam mortui eorum corpora ſupina in ſepulchris facie orientem reſpicerent. <hi>Caſſ. de Vet.

               <p>THE learned Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the ſolemn Interment, hath theſe Words upon "this Subject, <q>We may note the Poſiture and Poſition of the Corps, which among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hath always been to turn the Feet to the Eaſt, with the Head to the Weſt; that ſo they may be ready to meet the LORD, whom the Ancients did believe ſhould appear in the oriental Part of Heaven. <hi>Durand.

Or as our ingenious Mr. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> believes, That they might be in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Prayer, with their Faces to the Eaſt, as ſoon as they were raiſed. There are ſome
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0565000600:53"/>
ancient Authors tell us, That the old Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Attica</hi> buried thus before the Days of <hi>Solon,</hi> who, as they report, convinced the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that the Iſland of <hi>Salamis</hi> did of Right belong to them, by ſhewing them dead Bodies looking that Way, and Sepulchres tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards the Eaſt, as they uſe to bury. <hi>Diog. Laert. Vit. Solon,</hi> &amp;c. And the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt upon <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſays, It was the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> to bury their Dead thus: Tho' a learned modern Writer ſuppoſes theſe Authors miſtaken, and cites <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Elian</hi> to prove, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> turned their Dead towards the Weſt. However it is certain, that all Nations had one certain Way of placing the Corps, from which they would not vary; and we Chriſtians have ſo great Antiquity for our Cuſtom, that we ought not out of Singularity to alter it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>NO Doubt but this learned Man had great Reaſon for this Concluſion, as well knowing that this ancient Rite, was ſtruck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries, as a ſilly Fancy and an idle Dream: Who never would obſerve it,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0565000600:54"/>
were it not that they are ſometimes obliged; but would with thoſe who are not obliged, act the very Reverſe, and bury North and South. I wiſh there were no powerfuller Enemies to it, than them now a Days; but, <hi>as a Man's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are too often thoſe of his own Houſhold;</hi> ſo, 'tis to be lamented, that ſome who pretend to be of our own Church, are upon all Occaſions ſecret Advocates againſt this Ceremony. When therefore there is ſuch Oppoſition without, and ſuch Treachery within, 'tis high Time to be on the Guard againſt our Enemies; leaſt a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſo venerable for its Antiquity, and ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its Obſervation, be laid aſide: Was it but for this one Thing, that it ſpeaks the Hope of the whole Chriſtian Church, ſince the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Times of Chriſtianity, about the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſame Body. It is too true, that there are ſome at this Time of the Day, as well as were in the Days of the Apoſtle, who think <hi>it a Thing incredible that GOD ſhould raiſe the Dead;</hi> ſome really diſbelieving the Reſurrection of any Body, and others that of the ſame Body. But as long as this Ceremony is in Being, it will always be a ready Proof, that the whole
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0565000600:55"/>
Chriſtian Church, did not only believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body, but of that very Body, which was laid down in the Grave. For they obſerved it, that they might be ready with their Faces to meet their SAVIOUR at his coming to Judgment, which certainly implies that they believed that very Body ſhould riſe again.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a received Tradition among the Vulgar, That at the Time of Cock-crowing, the Midnight Spirits forſake theſe lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and go to their proper Places. They wander, ſay they, about the World, from the dead Hour of Night, when all Things are buried in Sleep and Darkneſs, till the Time of Cock-crowing, and then they

depart. Hence it is, that in Country-Places, where the Way of Life requires more early La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they always go chearfully to Work at that Time; whereas if they are called abroad ſooner, they are apt to imagine every Thing they ſee or hear, to be a wandring Ghoſt. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion, in his Tragedy of <hi>Hamlet.</hi>

               <p>I believe none who aſſent to the Truth of Divine Revelation, deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men; the one to guard and protect them, and the other to harm and work their Ruin; that the one are <hi>thoſe</hi>

               <p>WHAT then could theſe have ordinarily been, but the Appearances of ſome of thoſe <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> or Darkneſs?

                  <hi>Theſe Viſions and Shades of the Saints, which appear in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and at the Tombs, are not the Souls of the Saints themſelves, but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes.</hi> Not that GOD could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Ghoſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and order it again to viſit the Earth, as he made <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to appear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration; but that a Thing of this Nature was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, and ſeldom happen'd.</p>
               <p>TAKING it therefore for granted, that there have been Apparitions of Angels, I believe it will alſo be owned, that theſe Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night. And truly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0565000600:60"/>
was there no direct Proof of this, yet the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their appearing in the Night, being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, would almoſt perſwade us, that the Night is the moſt proper Time for ſuch Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.

                     <hi>Lock,</hi> Human Underſt.</note> as an ingenious Author imagines, <q>have ſo aſſociated the Idea of Spirit to the Night, that the one never appears without the other;</q> or whether there is ſomething in the Preſence of Night, ſome Awfulneſs and Horrour, which naturally diſpoſe the Mind of Man to theſe Reflections. I am indeed very inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that theſe Legendary Stories of Nurſes and old Women, are the Occaſion of much greater Fears, than People without them, would generally have of theſe Things; but I cannot help thinking, that the Preſence of Night, would naturally lead a Man to ſome Reflection of Spirits, without any ſuch Cauſe as that learned Author mentions. There are ſome particular Times, which will naturally raiſe ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Thoughts: Thus on a bright ſunny Day
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0565000600:61"/>
we are naturally diſpoſed to Mirth and Gaiety; when the Day over-caſts, or the Weather is hazy, we then turn indolent and dull, and ſooth our ſelves in Melancholly; if it Thunder and Lighten, we think of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſudden Death: And thus alſo the Night, as it inclines us to grave and ſerious Thoughts, raiſes in us Horrour and Diſmay, and makes us afraid, even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear; ſo it may of it ſelf be look'd upon as a natural Cauſe of ſuch Reflections.</p>
               <p>BUT however this be, we muſt neceſſarily own, that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night, or we muſt give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages, to Hiſtorians prophane and ſacred, and the wiſeſt and beſt in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of Men.</p>
               <p>IN the Heathen World there are many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of which I ſhall only mention this one out of <hi>Plutarch:</hi>

him, all the Reſt of the Army being huſht and ſilent; and muſing with himſelf, and very thoughtful, as he turn'd his Eye to the Door, he ſaw a ſtrange and terrible Appearance, of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without ſpeaking. <hi>Brutus</hi> boldly asked him, What art thou?

               <p>BUT tho' it be true from Scripture, that there have been nightly Apparitions, yet theſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0565000600:63"/>
are chiefly of good Angels; whereas this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion principally means, the Appearances of evil Spirits. It muſt be owned indeed, that the Appearances of evil Spirits, if litterally, are yet but very ſeldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture; but however, that they wander and appear at Night, is very deducible from, if not litterally mentioned in it. Their's <hi>is the Land of Darkneſs, and the Shadow of Death: They are reſerved under Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Judgment of the great Day; and we know that every one that doth Evil natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hateth the Light: They therefore love Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil.</hi> The Night therefore, in a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial Manner, ſeems to be their <hi>Hour,</hi> and the <hi>Power of Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS was the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as may be learned from the Fear of the Apoſtles, when they ſaw our Saviour about the fourth Watch of the Night, coming to them upon the Waters: <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xiv. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>They were affrighted and cryed out, ſuppoſing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0565000600:64"/>
they had ſeen a Spirit.</hi> Doctor <hi>Whitby</hi> upon this Place, ſays, <q>That the <hi>Jews</hi> had then an Opinion of hurtful Spirits walking in the Night, is evident from the ſeventy, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,</q> 
                  <hi>from the Peſtilence walking in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>

                  <hi>From</hi> the Fear of the Devils that walk in the Night.</p>
               <p>AND that this was alſo the Opinion of the ancient Chriſtians, is evident, not only from their dividing the Night into four Watches, the Evening, Midnight, Cock-crowing, and the Morning; which were the Military Diviſions of the Night, and which <note n="†" place="bottom">Si quidem &amp; in Nocte Stationes, &amp; Vigiliae Militares in quatuor partes diviſae ternis horarum ſpatiis ſecernun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> Lib. 1. de Eccle.

For ſuch was their Fierceneſs, that where Eight or Ten had been together in a Monaſtery, they would have made frequent and viſible Incurſions: Inſomuch, that they never all ſlept at the ſame Time, but took it by turns; ſome watching the Reſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing themſelves in ſinging Pſalms, in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reading. And St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Life of <hi>Anthony</hi> the Hermit, tells, Of many Conflicts that good Man had in the Night with the Powers of Darkneſs, whilſt they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to batter him <hi>from the ſtrong Holds</hi> of his Faith. And what can our Church chiefly mean in <hi>the Collect for Aid againſt Perils;</hi> but that GOD would ſend us Protection from all the Spirits of Darkneſs, theſe Midnight Wanderers

of the World: And for this Reaſon, every good Man, when he lies down to ſleep at Night, deſires the great <hi>Keeper of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who never ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth, to ſend his Holy Angels to pitch their Tents round about him,</hi> and baniſh from him the Spirits of the Night.</p>

who had been Abroad in the Night, ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Aurora itaque ſuperveniente, cum omnis haec ab ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis evaniſſet Daemonum multitudo. <hi>Caſſ.</hi> Coll. 8. C. 16.</note> That as ſoon as the Morn approached, they all vaniſhed and fled away. By this we ſee, that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day; but what Reaſon they had for it, except ſome Relations of the diſappearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour, I never yet have met with: But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night, Things of very memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worth, which might perhaps raiſe the pious Credulity of ſome Men to imagine, that there was ſomething more in it, than in other Times. It was about the Time of Cock-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when our Saviour was born, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſung the firſt Chriſtmas-Carol to the poor Shepherds, in the Fields of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Now it may be preſum'd, that as the Saviour of the World was then born, and the <hi>Heavenly Host</hi> had then deſcended to proclaim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the News, that the Angels of Darkneſs would be terrified and confounded, and immediately fly away: And perhaps this Conſideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion; for as this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0565000600:69"/>
may eaſily be ſuppoſed, ſo perhaps it has been imagin'd, that the Spirits of Darkneſs, having always in Memory that fatal Hour, are ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it.</p>
               <p>IT was alſo about this Time when he roſe from the Dead. And when the great <hi>Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> was riſen upon the World, no wonder that all the Clouds of Darkneſs and Wickedneſs were diſpell'd; no wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to ſhew their Heads: And this perhaps hath been another Reaſon of their imagining that Spirits go away at that time.</p>
               <p>A third Reaſon is, that Paſſage in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where Jacob <hi>wreſtled with the Angel for a Bleſſing;</hi> where the Angel ſays unto him, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxxii.</note> 
                  <hi>Let me go, for the Day breaketh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT indeed this Tradition ſeems more, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to have riſen from ſome particular Circumſtances attending the Time of Cock-crowing; and which, as <hi>Prudentius</hi> ſeems to ſay above, are an Emblem of the Approach of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0565000600:70"/>
the Day of the Reſurrection. For when we leave the World, we lie down in our Graves, and <hi>Reſt from our Labours;</hi> Sleep and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lay hold upon us, and there we abide till the laſt Day appear, when the Voice of the Arch-Angel ſhall awake us, that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day. And when we leave the common Buſineſs and Care of Life, we lie down in our Beds, as in a Grave, buried as it were in Sleep and Darkneſs, till the Cock crow, the welcome Meſſenger of the News of Day.</p>
               <p>THE Circumſtances therefore of the Time of Cock-crowing, being ſo natural a Figure and Repreſentation of the Morning of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Night ſo ſhadowing out the Night of the Grave; the third Watch, being as ſome ſuppoſe, the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at; the Noiſe of the <hi>Cock</hi> awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſleepy Man, and telling him as it were, <hi>the Night is far ſpent, the Day is at Hand;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting ſo naturally the Voice of the Arch-Angel awakening the Dead, and calling up the Righteous to everlaſting Day; ſo natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does the Time of Cock-crowing ſhadow out
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0565000600:71"/>
theſe Things, that probably ſome good well-meaning Men, have been brought to believe, that the very Devils themſelves, when the Cock Crew, and reminded them of them, did fear and tremble, and ſhun the Light.</p>
               <p>NOW in Anſwer to the firſt of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures: 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity, and becauſe of our Saviour's Birth and that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Heavenly Host,</hi> might be afraid and retire into thick Darkneſs; yet it will not hence follow, that it always happens ſo at the Time of Cock-crowing: For if they did fly away that Morning, the Circumſtances of our Saviour's Birth, the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire, their Muſick and their Preſence were the Occaſion of it: And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time, ſhould always at the Time of Cock-crowing drive them away, rather than when they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it at another, no Reaſon ſeems to be given.</p>
               <p>AS to the ſecond Conjecture, namely, That it was the Time of our Saviour's Riſing from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0565000600:72"/>
the Dead, I anſwer in the ſame Manner, That tho' it be allowed, that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkneſs, upon our Saviour's Riſing from the Dead; yet why it ſhould Occaſion them always to do ſo at that Time, no Reaſon can be given.</p>
               <p>AS to the third Conjecture, it is eaſy to obſerve, That this was a good Angel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they that ſhun the Light, are bad ones: This was the Angel of the Covenant, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of Light, and the Lord of the Day: We may therefore as well imagine, that it was not in his Power, to get out of the Arms of <hi>Jacob,</hi> without ſaying, <hi>Let me go;</hi> as to ſuppoſe he was obliged to go, becauſe he ſaid <hi>the Day breaketh.</hi> The meaning of which Words, <q>According to <hi>Willet,</hi> is not that the Angel was gone to the bleſſed Company of the Angels, to ſing their Morning Hymn to GOD, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> imagine: For the Angels, not only in the Morning, but at other Times, are exerciſed in praiſing GOD. But the Angel thus ſpeaketh according to the Cuſtom of Men, having now taken the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0565000600:73"/>
Form and Shape of a Man, as tho' he had haſt to other Buſineſs, and leaving <hi>Jacob</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to his Affairs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE laſt Conjecture of the Riſe of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſeems to carry greater probability than the Others: For as theſe Things are a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Circumſtances of the Morning of the Reſurrection, ſo they muſt ſure enough bring that laſt Day into Remembrance; and they never can do ſo, but as ſurely they muſt create Terrour and Confuſion in all the Devils and Ghoſts of the Night: Whilſt they aſſure them they ſhall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bliſs, but be hurried into that <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xxv. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> But that theſe Things are the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Flying away at the Approach of Day, is not to be ſuppoſed. On the contrary, the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Day-light, and are mid-day Devils, as well as mid-night ones: For the Devil is inceſſant in his Temptations, and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night, tho'
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0565000600:74"/>
perhaps has ſeldom appear'd but in Darkneſs. Thus St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in one of his Meditations, <note n="*" place="bottom">Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus, libera nos ab ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſario noſtro quotidiano, qui ſive dormiamus, ſive vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus,—die ac nocte fraudibus &amp; artibus, nunc palam nunc occulte ſagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens, ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terficiat animas noſtras. <hi>Aug. Sol. Cap.</hi> 16.</note> We implore thee, O GOD! that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt deliver us from our daily Enemy, who by his Wiles and Cunning is always watching us, Day and Night, Sleeping and Waking; and both openly and in ſecret, ſhooting at us his poiſoned Arrows, that he may deſtroy our Souls.</p>
               <p>AND now, what, tho' this be true, as it moſt certainly ſeems to be ſo, that at the chearful Hour of Cock-crowing, the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ghoſts are not driven away, but ſtill continue going too and fro? What, tho' then their Power be ſtill the ſame, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions as fully bent to do Evil? Conſider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World, and there will be found as much Safety for us, in the midſt of Evil Spirits, as if they abſented at that Time. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of GOD, is the ſame then, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0565000600:75"/>
at other Times; nothing but that, preſerved us continually, and that, will always be able to preſerve us. However great may be the Malice of Devils; however deſirous of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Ruin; tho' they watch all Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and are unwearied in tempting us; <hi>yet the loving Kindneſs of the LORD endureth for Ever, and his Mercy is over all his Works: He will not ſuffer our Foot to be moved; he that keepeth us will not ſleep: We ſhall not be afraid of the Sun by Day, nor the Moon by Night: For the Peſtilence that walketh in Darkneſs, nor for the Sickneſs that deſtroyeth in the Noon-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ARE we then afraid of Darkneſs and the preſence of Night? Let us remember the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of them, and have but Faith in him, and we ſhall find <hi>our Night turned into Day. In his Light ſhall we ſee Light:</hi> We ſhall be as ſecure as if there was no Darkneſs about us, as well knowing, that that GOD which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects us, ſees through the thickeſt <hi>Mediums,</hi> and the darkeſt Night: <hi>For with him the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no Darkneſs, but the Night is as clear as the Day; the Darkneſs and Light to him are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0565000600:76"/>
both alike.</hi> Or are we afraid of that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the Devil, that nightly Rambler of the World, who is a Lover of Night and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Let us truſt in GOD, and no harm ſhall happen to us. If we will but <hi>fear no Evil, his Rod and his Staff ſhall Comfort us, tho' we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death: For GOD hath reſerved the Devil and his Angels in everlaſting Chains, under Darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</hi> Tho' therefore he is permitted to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the World, yet he is ſo chain'd up, that without GOD'S particular Order or Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men; and he is ſo reſerved and kept in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be viſible to them, without the Permiſſion of GOD: So little Reaſon hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell.</p>
               <p>WHEN then the Night pours out her Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, covers all Things with Darkneſs, and ſtrikes thee with Horrour; <hi>Lift but up thy Eyes to the Hills, from whence cometh thy Help,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0565000600:77"/>
and thou ſhalt clearly ſee, that our <hi>Lord GOD is a Light and Defence to thee.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Church-Yards; why the Vulgar are generally afraid of paſſing through them at Night: The Original of this Fear: That there is nothing in them now, more than in other Places to be afraid of.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE moſt of ignorant People are afraid of going through a <hi>Church-Yard</hi> at Night-time. If they are obliged upon ſome haſty and urgent Affair, they fear and tremble, till they are beyond its Bounds, but they generally avoid it, and go further about. It would, no Queſtion, be better if there were fewer <hi>Path-ways</hi> through Church-Yards than there are, both as it would prevent ſeveral <hi>Abuſes</hi> committed in them, and alſo cauſe the Aſhes of the Dead to be in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0565000600:79"/>
greater quiet, and more undiſturbed Peace: We ſhould not then ſee Church-Yards changed into common Dunghils, nor ſhould we tread ſo frequently upon the Bones of our Friends: But when for the Conveniency of Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or other Reaſons, there are allowed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ways, it is a very great Weakneſs to be afraid of paſſing through them.</p>
               <p>THE Reaſon of this Fear is, a Notion they have imbib'd, that in <hi>Church-Yards</hi> there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the <hi>Dead-time</hi> of Night. Indeed there is at that Time ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing awful and horrible every where, and it muſt be confeſs'd ſomething more ſolemn in a <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> than in the Generality of other Places; but that it is then more frequented with <hi>Apparitions and Ghoſts</hi> than other Places are, is at this Time of Day intirely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and without any Reaſon.</p>
               <p>THE Original of this Timorouſneſs may be deduc'd from the Heathens: For they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the <hi>departed Ghoſts</hi> came out of their <hi>Tombs</hi> and <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> and wander'd about the

               </p>
               <p>IT having therefore been a current Opinion of the Heathens, that <hi>Places of Burial and Church-Yards</hi> were frequently haunted with <hi>Spectres</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> it is eaſy to imagine, that the Opinion has been handed from them, among the ignorant and unlearned, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Ages of Chriſtianity to the preſent Day. And indeed, tho' now there may be no ſuch Things, yet that there have been, need not be diſputed; not that they were the real Souls of Men departed: For I cannot ſee for

                  </note> theſe Apparitions of the Saints which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at Tombs and Temples, are not the Souls of the Saints themſelves, but the good Angels appearing in their Likeneſs. And I imagine it muſt be ſo too, with the Souls of bad Men, they appear not themſelves, but they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the Evil Angels. For the Soul upon the Departure, <hi>returns to GOD that gave it,</hi> who alots it its Station in the World of Spirits, where it is kept till the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Happineſs or Miſery, when it ſhall receive its Compleation of the one, or the other.

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0565000600:83"/>BUT now with us, GOD be thanked, the Scene is changed, we live not in the Darkneſs of Errour, but in the Light of Truth; we worſhip not <hi>Daemons,</hi> but the GOD of the whole Earth; and our Temples are not the Temples of Idols, but the Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly GOD.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the dark Ages of <hi>Popery,</hi> it was a Cuſtom, if any <hi>Well</hi> had an awful Situation, and was ſeated in ſome lonely melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Vale; if its Water was clear and limpid, and beautifully <note n="*" place="bottom">—Viridi ſi margine clauderet undas.— Herba.—<hi>Juven.

Hence it is, that we have at

this Day Wells and Fountains called, ſome St. <hi>John</hi>'s, St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s, St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>Well,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>TO theſe kind of Wells, the common People are accuſtomed to go, on a Summer's Evening, to refreſh themſelves with a <hi>Walk</hi> after the Toil of the Day, to drink the Water of the Fountain, and enjoy the pleaſing Proſpect of Shade and Stream.</p>
               <p>NOW this Cuſtom (tho' at this Time of Day, very commendable, and harmleſs, and innocent) ſeems to be the Remains of that ſuperſtitious Practice of the Papiſts, of paying Adoration to Wells and Fountains: For they imagin'd there was ſome Holineſs and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them, and ſo worſhipped them.

               </p>
               <p>THE giving of Names to Wells, is of great Antiquity: We find it a Cuſtom in the Days of the old Patriarchs. <hi>Abraham</hi> obſerved this Cuſtom; and therefore the Well, which he recover'd from the Servants of <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> He <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xxi. 31.</note> called <hi>Beer-ſheba,</hi> or the Well of the Oath,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0565000600:87"/>
                  <hi>becauſe there they ſware both of them.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when his Herdſmen had found a Well, and the Herdſmen of <hi>Gerar</hi> had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with them about the Right of it, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>called the Name of the Well</hi> Eſeck, that is, <hi>Strife: becauſe they ſtrove with him. And he digged another Well, and ſtrove for that alſo, and he called the Name of it</hi> Sitnah, that is, <hi>Hatred. And he removed from thence, and digged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Well, and for that they ſtrove not; and he called the Name of it,</hi> Rehoboth, that is, <hi>Room. And he ſaid for now the LORD hath made Room for us, and we ſhall be fruitful in the Land.</hi> And we read it was at <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Well</hi> where JESUS talked with the Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria.</hi> To give Names therefore to Wells, is of an ancient Standing; but to pay Homage and Worſhip to them, was never heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People of GOD, till they ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to groſs Idolatry, and became Worſhippers of Stocks and Stones: <hi>When the Creature became worſhipped inſtead of the Creator,</hi> then was this Cuſtom firſt introduced, in the Ages of Popiſh Ignorance and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0565000600:88"/>THERE need be no Queſtion, but as this Cuſtom is practically Heatheniſh, ſo it is alſo originally: For the Heathens were wont to worſhip Streams and Fountains, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Nymphs, whom they imagin'd the Goddeſſes of the Waters, preſided over them. As the Papiſts have borrowed many of their ſilly and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies from the Religion of the Heathens, ſo this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, a ſottiſh, ſtupid, and abominable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, they could borrow no where elſe. <hi>For we had no ſuch Cuſtom,</hi> neither at any Time <hi>the Churches of GOD.</hi>

Hence it was that they conſulted the Intrails of Beaſts, the Flights of Birds, and ſeveral other Things: And that the very
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0565000600:91"/>
Things above-mentioned, as the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there declare, have been obſerved by them; yea, they have obſerv'd them, even in the remoteſt Ages, beyond the Days of the oldeſt Records. The Heathen World there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was full of them, and without all doubt they have been handed down to us, from theſe Times.</p>
               <p>AND as it is not to be queſtion'd, but we had them from the Heathens, ſo in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the Heathens have taken them from the People of GOD, and built many of their Folies and ominous Superſtitions on a Cuſtom which they alone were indulged in. For in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Ages of the World, when a Matter of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Conſequence was depending, and the Servants of GOD would know what the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent would be, they asked a <hi>Sign</hi> of GOD, by deſiring that ſuch a Thing might happen, if they were to ſucceed, and GOD was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo condeſcending as to grant them their deſire. Thus we read, That <note n="*" place="bottom">Sam. i. 14. iii. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Jonathan</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd only by his Armour-Bearer, not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0565000600:92"/>
the Steepneſs of the Rocks, nor Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Enemies, attempted the Garriſon of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and conquered, through a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of this Nature. <hi>If they ſay,</hi> ſays he to his Armour-Bearer, <hi>Tarry untill we come up, then we will ſtand ſtill in our Place, and will not go up unto them; but if they ſay come up unto us, then we will go up; for the LORD hath delivered them into our Hands, and this ſhall be a Sign unto us.</hi> And ſo indeed it came to paſs, GOD who had inſpired <hi>Jonathan</hi> with this Thought, directing the Tongues of the others according to his Wiſhes. In like Manner, when the good old Servant of <hi>Abraham</hi> had arrived at the City of <hi>Nahor,</hi> to find a Wife for his Maſter's Son; we have him deſiring of GOD, that the Sign of the Woman he ſhould pitch upon, might be her ſaying, <hi>Drink, and I will give thy Camels drink alſo.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxiv. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>And he ſaid, O Lord GOD of my Maſter</hi> Abraham, <hi>I pray thee ſend me good ſpeed this Day, and ſhew Kindneſs unto my Maſter</hi> Abraham: <hi>Behold, I ſtand here by the Well of Water, and the Daughters of the Men of the City come out to draw Water. And
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0565000600:93"/>
let it come to paſs, that the Damſel to whom I ſhall ſay, let down thy Pitcher, I pray thee, that I may Drink; And ſhe ſhall ſay, Drink, and I will give thy Camels drink alſo: Let the ſame be ſhe that thou haſt appointed for thy Servant</hi> Iſaac; <hi>and thereby ſhall I know that thou haſt ſhewed Kindneſs unto my Maſter.</hi> This happened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Prayer, by which he knew that the LORD had proſpered his Journey. Now this Cuſtom we know the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> imitated, when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the GOD of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ark. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sam. i. 6, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>They took the Ark of the LORD, and laid it on a Cart, and ſent it away. And they ſaid, If it goeth by the Way of his own Coaſt to</hi> Beth-ſhemoth, <hi>then he hath done us this great Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN theſe early Ages of the World, GOD permitted ſuch Things upon extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to be asked by his own People. But they were only peculiar to thoſe Times. We have no Warrant for doing the like: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not us to preſcribe Means to GOD, by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0565000600:94"/>
which we may judge of our future Succeſs, but to depend on his Power and Wiſdom, his Care and Providence. The Obſervation of Omens, ſuch as the falling of Salt, a Hare croſſing the Way, of the Dead-Watch, of Cric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſinful and diabolical: They are the Inventions of the Devil, to draw Men from a due Truſt in GOD, and make them his own Vaſſals.

Some of them have ſeen <hi>Fairies,</hi> ſome <hi>Spirits</hi> in the Shapes of <hi>Cows</hi> and <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Horſes;</hi> and ſome have ſeen even the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, with a <hi>cloven Foot.</hi> All which, is either <hi>Hearſay</hi> or a <hi>ſtrong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Not that there have not been, or may not be Apparitions; we know that there have undoubtedly been ſuch Things, and that there ſtill are, upon particular Occaſions; but that almoſt all the Stories of Ghoſts and Spirits, are grounded on no other Bottom, than the Fears and Fancies, and weak Brains of Men.</p>
               <p>IN their Account of the Apparition of the Devil, they always deſcribe him with a <hi>cloven Foot:</hi> That is always his diſtinguiſhing Badge, whatever Shape he appears in; whether it be in Beauty or Deformity, he never appears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Such is the old Tradition they have received of his appearing, and ſuch is their Belief of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0565000600:97"/>INDEED it muſt be confeſs'd, that this is not ſo improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold. For tho' perhaps few of them have ought elſe for this Opinion, but <hi>old Wives Fables,</hi> or the Picture of the Devil, which they have always obſerved drawn with a cloven Foot, yet there ſeems to be ſome Truth in it. For in the Times of frequent Apparitions, the Devil was wont to appear ſo, if we may believe Antiquity; and there is alſo ſome Reaſon for it, conſidering the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the fallen Angels.</p>
               <p>THE <note n="*" place="bottom">Brown<hi>'s</hi> Vulg. Err.</note> Author of the <hi>Vulgar Errors</hi> upon this ſame Subject, hath theſe Words. <q>The Ground of this Opinion at firſt, might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat, which anſwers this Deſcription. This was the Opinion of the ancient Chriſtians, concerning the Apparitions of <hi>Panites, Fauns</hi> and <hi>Satyrs;</hi> and of this Form we read of one, that appeared to <hi>Anthony</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. The ſame is alſo confirmed from Expoſitions of Holy Scripture. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0565000600:98"/>
it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not offer unto Devils:</hi> The original Word is <hi>Seghnirim;</hi> that is, <hi>rough and hairy Goats,</hi> becauſe in that Shape the Devil moſt often appeared, as is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> as <hi>Tremellius</hi> hath alſo explain'd, and as the Word <hi>Aſcimah,</hi> the God of <hi>Emath</hi> is by ſome conceived. He obſerves alſo, That the <hi>Goat</hi> was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the <hi>Sin Offering,</hi> and is the Emblem of ſinful Men at the Day of Judgment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AND of this Opinion was alſo the learned Mr. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mede, Diſ. <hi>40.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Mede.</hi> He ſays, <q>That when Spirits converſe with Men, it is under ſome viſible Shape, and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they aſſum'd, ſhould be of ſomething which more or leſs reſembled their Condition. For as in Nature we ſee every Thing hath a ſeveral and ſuitable <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> as a Badge of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Nature, whereby it is known, as by a Habit of Diſtinction, ſo it ſeems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits. And as in a well governed Common-Wealth, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0565000600:99"/>
Sort and Condition is known by a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Habit, agreeable to his Quality; ſo it ſeems it ſhould be in GOD'S great Common-Wealth, concerning the Shapes which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits take upon them. And he that gave the Law, that a Man ſhould not wear the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Woman, nor a Woman the Habit of a Man, becauſe that as he had made them diverſe, ſo would he have them ſo known by their Habits; ſo it ſeems he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a good and a bad Spirit, a noble and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble one, to appear unto Man after the ſame Faſhion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>NOW from this it will follow, that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape, but the Shape of Man, becauſe their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Excellency is reſembled only in the moſt excellent of all viſible Creatures. The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable, no other Shape becoming thoſe who are called <hi>the Sons of GOD,</hi> but his only, who <hi>was created after GOD's own Image.</hi> And yet, not his neither as he now is, but according as he was before his Fall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0565000600:100"/>
in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity. Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin; and the Angel in the Goſpel appears like a young Man, <hi>His</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xxviii.</note> 
                     <hi>Countenance like Lightning, and his Raiment white as Snow,</hi> as it were reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Beauty of glorified Bodies, in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability, Sublimity and Purity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>HENCE alſo it follows on the contrary, that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whilſt Man was in his Integrity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Spirit fallen from his firſt glorious Perfection, and therefore muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſuch Shape, which might argue his Imperfection and Abaſement, which was the Shape of a Beaſt: Otherwiſe no Reaſon can be given, why he ſhould not rather have appeared to <hi>Eve</hi> in the Shape of a Woman, than of a Serpent; for ſo he might have gain'd an Opinion with her, both of more Excellency and Knowledge. But ſince the Fall of Man, the Caſe is alter'd; now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man; and no Wonder, ſince one falling Star
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0565000600:101"/>
may reſemble another. And therefore he appears it ſeems in the Shape of Man's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, either for Age or Deformity, as like an old Man (for ſo the Witches ſay:) And perhaps it is not altogether falſe, which is vulgarly affirmed, that the Devil appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in humane Shape, hath always a Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſome uncouth Member or other; as tho' he could not yet take upon him hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Shape intirely, for that Man himſelf is not intirely and utterly fallen as he is.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THUS far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter, and that with ſuch Strength of Reaſon and Argument, as leaves at leaſt a Probability behind it, of the Truth of this Opinion.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Part of this Converſation gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally turns upon <hi>Fairies.</hi> Theſe, they tell you, have frequently been heard and ſeen, nay that there are ſome ſtill living who were ſtollen away by them, and confined ſeven Years. According to the Deſcription they give of them, who pretend to have ſeen them, they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0565000600:102"/>
are in the Shape of Men, exceeding little: They are always clad in Green, and frequent the Woods and Fields; when they make Cakes (which is a Work they have been often heard at) they are very noiſy; and when they have done, they are full of Mirth and Paſtime. But generally they dance in <hi>Moon-Light,</hi> when Mortals are aſleep, and not capable of ſeeing them, as may be obſerved on the following Morn; their dancing Places being very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable. For as they dance Hand in Hand, and ſo make a <hi>Circle</hi> in their Dance, ſo next Day there will be ſeen <hi>Rings</hi> and <hi>Circles</hi> on the Graſs.</p>
               <p>NOW in all this there is really nothing, but an old fabulous Story, which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> of a certain Sort of Beings called <hi>Lamiae,</hi> which were eſteem'd ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and cruel, as to take away young Children and ſlay them. Theſe, together with the <hi>Fauns,</hi> the <hi>Gods of the Woods,</hi> ſeem to have form'd the Notion of Fairies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0565000600:103"/>THIS Opinion, in the benighted Ages of Popery, when <hi>Hobgoblins</hi> and <hi>Sprights</hi> were in every <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Village,</hi> by every <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and in every <hi>Wood,</hi> was very common. But when that Cloud was diſpell'd, and the Day ſprung up, thoſe Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error, did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Tradition they hold, and which is often talk'd of, is, that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in. Thence it was that formerly, ſuch frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People ſay now and then, ſuch a Place is dangerous to be paſs'd through at Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Spirit walks there. Nay, they'll fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell you, that ſome Spirits have lamented the Hardneſs of their Condition, in being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Places, and have therefore deſir'd the Perſon who was ſo hardy as to ſpeak to them, to gift them with a warmer Walk, by ſome well grown <hi>Hedge,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0565000600:104"/>
or in ſome <hi>ſhady Vale,</hi> where they might be ſhelter'd from the Rain and Wind.</p>
               <p>THE Stories, that Apparitions, have been ſeen oftner than once in the ſame Place, have no Doubt been the Riſe and Spring of the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Places of Spirits; but why they are ſaid ſometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable, is not ſo certainly known. It is however highly probable, that when the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Superſtition of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, had filled the World with <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Ghoſts,</hi> that this alſo was invented among them. For they ſeem to have the moſt <hi>Right</hi> to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of this Nature, whoſe Brains were ſo fruitful of Folly, as to invent that <note place="bottom">
                     <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Ch. Hiſt. Cen. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Dunſtan</hi> took the Devil by the Noſe, with a Pair of hot <hi>Tongs</hi> till he roar'd again. For if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may be burnt, he may alſo be ſtarv'd; if he took ſuch Pains to get his Noſe out of the <hi>Pincers,</hi> without Doubt in a froſty Night, he would wiſh to be as warm as poſſible. He that believes the one, muſt neceſſarily believe the other. And therefore it very near amounts
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0565000600:105"/>
to a Demonſtration, who were the Authors of this Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Monks.</hi> We are ſure they invented the one, and need little que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but they invented the other.</p>
               <p>THERE is a Story in the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> (which they may believe that will) of the <hi>evil Spirits</hi> flying into the utmoſt Parts of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Tob. vi.</note> 
                  <hi>For as</hi> Tobias <hi>went in unto his Wife, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Words of</hi> Raphael, <hi>and took the Aſhes of the Perfumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fiſh thereupon, and made a Smoke therewith. The which Smell, when the evil Spirit had ſmelled, he fled into the utmoſt Parts of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Angel bound him.</hi> Now from this it is evident, that the Spirit was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to forſake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings, for inhoſpitable Deſarts and open Air: And from this, perhaps, ſome of thoſe <hi>doting Monks,</hi> have perſuaded themſelves into a Belief of theſe Things.</p>
               <p>WHEN it is proved to us, that this Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> is the Word of GOD, we may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0565000600:106"/>
more Veneration for this Vulgar Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but till then, we muſt be iudulg'd in wondering, how a Spirit, that is an <hi>immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subſtance,</hi> can be affected with our Heat or Cold, or any Power or Quality of <hi>material Beings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE laſt Topick of this Converſation I ſhall take Notice of, ſhall be the Tales of <hi>haunted</hi> Houſes. And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at, that this is never omitted. For formerly almoſt every Place had a Houſe of this Kind. If a Houſe was ſeated on ſome melancholly Place, or built in ſome old Romantick Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; or if any particular Accident had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in it, ſuch as Murder, ſudden Death, or the like, to be ſure that Houſe had a Mark ſet on it, and was afterwards eſteemed the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Ghoſt. In talking upon this Point, they generally ſhow the Occaſion of the Houſe's being <hi>haunted,</hi> the merry Pranks of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and how it was laid. Stories of this Kind are infinite, and there are few <hi>Villages,</hi> which have not either had ſuch an Houſe in it, or near it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0565000600:107"/>AND indeed there are Men of good Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledge, who are as far as others from Superſtition, who are inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſuch Things have been upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Emergencies; tho', among the Stories that are told, they believe not one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. They know that Spirits have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared to Men out of Houſes, and they can ſee no Reaſon why they may not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in them: They know nothing in an Houſe more than in another Place, to prevent an Apparition, but an equal Help to its Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The Air, which a Ghoſt is ſuppoſed to be wrapped in, when it becomes viſible to Men, is there to be found, and they know of nothing elſe that may be an Argument againſt it. An Author of good Credit tells us, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cum <hi>Romae</hi> aegra valetudine oppreſſus forem, jace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remque in lectulo, ſpeciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigilanti obſervatam fuiſſe, quam cum inſpicerem, diu cogitabundus, &amp;c.—Cum meos ſenſus vigere, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guram illam nuſquam a me dilabi, &amp;c. <hi>Alex. ab Alex. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 9.</note> That when he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was taken with Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and obliged to keep his Bed: As he lay in this Condition, he obſerved, as he was once
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0565000600:108"/>
awake, a <hi>Woman</hi> of a very beautiful Perſon coming towards him. Upon this he was ſilent for ſome Time, and very thoughtful, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the while with himſelf, whether it was not rather a <hi>deceptio viſus</hi> than a real Being. But when he perceived his Senſes ſound and intire, and that the Object ſtill continued; he asked, What ſhe was? In Anſwer to which, ſhe repeated the very Words he had ſpoke to her, in a ſneering and diſdainful Manner. After ſhe had taken a good View of him, ſhe departed.</p>
               <p>THE Commentator upon this Place, ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Sed haec ſemper mera ſomnia eſſe putavi. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> He looks upon this Story, and the reſt which are mention'd along with it, to be nothing but Dreams and Fancies. And for ought that I know to the contrary, they may be ſo; but however it muſt be confeſs'd, this Story in particular is well atteſted, being told by the Man himſelf, who was a great and a learned Man, and who, if we may believe himſelf, ſeems to be as ſure that he had his Eyes open, as the Commentator can be of the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0565000600:109"/>BUT whatever Truth there may be in it, it is certain that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they are perſwaded of the Truth of it, to a Fault. For they are ſo ſure of it, that they have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Forms of <hi>exorciſing</hi> ſuch Houſes; which becauſe they have often been heard of, but ſeldom ſeen; and are thoſe very Things, which raiſed, in the Vulgar formerly, ſuch an Opinion of their ignorant Prieſts, as to make them be eſteemed Men of the greateſt Faith and Learning; and becauſe alſo the Opinion has reached even our Days, and 'tis common for the preſent Vulgar to ſay, none can lay a Spirit but a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt;</hi> it ſhall be the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the next Chapter, to give one of thoſe Forms of <hi>exorciſing</hi> an Houſe; not that they are envied for their Art of <hi>conjuring,</hi> but that it may be ſeen, how well they deſerve the Character they go under.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is uſual, in Country Places and Villages, where the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs of the Age hath made no great Conqueſt, to obſerve ſome particular Times with ſome Ceremonies, which were cuſtomary in the Days of our Fore-fathers: Such are the great Feſtivals of Chriſtmas, Eaſter, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

               <p>THIS ſeems to be the Remains of a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Cuſtom once in this Land (but now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt buried in that general Contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and love of the World, which prevail ſo much every where) of attending the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayers on Saturday, and laying aſide the Concerns of this Life, to be fitter for the Duties of the Day following.

                  <q>it was an holy Cuſtom among our Fore-fathers, when at the Ringing to Prayer the <hi>Eve</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Husbandman</hi> would give over his Labour in the Field, and the <hi>Tradeſman</hi> his Work in the Shop, and go to Evening Prayer in the Church, to prepare their Souls, that their Minds might more

               <p>AND indeed it was the Cuſtom both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the Chriſtian Church. They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them entred upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> without ſome Preparation for it. <hi>Moſes</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xvi.—</note> taught the <hi>Jews</hi> to remember the <hi>Sabbath</hi> over Night; from whence in all Probability it comes to paſs, that the Eve of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath</hi> is called the <hi>Preparation.</hi> The Preparation mentioned by the Evangeliſts, begun at Three a Clock on <hi>Friday</hi> Afternoon; it was proclaimed with the Noiſe of Trumpets and Horns, that they might be better put in Mind of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>'s draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and of that Preparation which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for it.</p>

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0565000600:137"/>IN the Year of our LORD 1203, <hi>William,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> called a Council of the chief Men of his Kingdom, at which alſo was preſent the Pope's Legate; and it was then determin'd, that <hi>Saturday</hi> after the twelfth Hour ſhould be kept holy; that no one ſhould follow their Buſineſs nor Callings, but deſiſt as on other Holy Days: That they ſhould be put in Mind of it by the Tolling of the Bell, and then mind the Buſineſs of Religion as on Holy Days, be preſent at the Sermon, and hear Veſpers; that this ſhould be the Practice till <hi>Munday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whoever acted otherwiſe ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed.</p>

I wiſh they had never been guilty of a worſe Fraud than this. But it may fairly be ſuppoſed, that when <hi>Mid-day</hi> became the Time of Dining and ſaying <hi>Noon Song,</hi> it was for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon called Noon by the Monks, who were the Maſters of the Language during the dark Ages.

               <p>NOW hence hath come the preſent Cuſtom, of ſpending a Part of <hi>Saturday</hi> Afternoon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſervile Labour. And that our Fore-fathers,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0565000600:139"/>
when the Bell was heard, attended the Evening Prayer, not fearing the Loſs of Time, nor the Neceſſities of Poverty; happy would it be for us, would we ſo baniſh the Care of the Body for the Care of the Soul! Would we leave to converſe about ſecular Buſineſs, and mind then the Buſineſs of Religion; would we remember that it is <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxiii. 54.—</note> the <hi>Preparation, and that the</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <hi>draws on.</hi>

                  <hi>Prayers would be ſet forth in his Sight as the Incenſe, and the lifting up of our Hands be an Evening Sacrifice:</hi> And like the Smell of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Garment in the Noſtrils of his Father, the Smell of our Prayers <hi>would</hi>

                  <hi>be like the Smell of a Field which the LORD hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now what is this Preparation, but the <hi>Trimming of our Lamps</hi> againſt we meet the LORD on the next Day? Our Bodies ſhould be refreſhed by ceaſing early from their Labour, that they may be active and vigorous; and our Souls waſhed with Sobriety and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and the private or publick Prayer of the Evening. Thus ſhould we meet the LORD at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and obtain thoſe Mercies we ſought of him there.</p>
               <p>ART thou then bleſſed with an Affluence of Things, and hath Providence placed Thee above the careful Stations of Life? What Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

                  <hi>WHY then art thou fearful, O! Thou of little Faith! Why doſt thou take ſo much Thought for thy Life?

               <p>THIS was probably the Reaſon of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom among the <hi>Heathen Saxons;</hi> but I cannot think the Obſervation of it was continued for the ſame Reaſon, after Chriſtianity was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.

                  <q>That tho' the ancient <hi>Saxons</hi> obſerved Twelve Days at that Time, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the Sun, in hopes of his Returning; yet when Chriſtianity prevail'd, all theſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Sacrifices were laid aſide, and that Time of Feaſting was joined with the religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of that Seaſon, which in other Parts of the World were obſerved by Chriſtians.</q> And in like Manner as theſe Days of Feaſting were joined with the religious Solemnities of that Seaſon, ſo the keeping up of this Cuſtom, ſeems to have been done with another View, than it was originally. If a Conjecture may be allowed, it might have been done on Account

of our Saviour's Birth, which happened that Night. For as the Burning of it before Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, was an Emblem of the Coming of the Sun, which they worſhipped as their God; ſo the continuing it after, might have been for a Symbol of that Light, which was that Night born into the World: <hi>The Light that ſhineth in Darkneſs; the Light that lightned the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>that turn'd them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND indeed it will be ſome ſtrengthening of the Conjecture, that Light has been the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of ſeveral Things, both in Scripture, and in the ancient Church: For the Scripture makes uſe of it, and the Church in Imitation of the Scripture, as a lively Repreſentation of ſeveral Things.

And as this was done at their Feaſts, ſo no doubt it was obſerved at the great Feaſt of the Nativity; which Song, no Queſtion of it, was to them, what the <hi>Chriſtmas-Carol</hi> ſhould be to us.

               <p>AND no doubt, thoſe Chriſtians were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy of Cenſure, who imagined, as the Heathens did, that the ſending of a Preſent then, was any way <hi>Lucky,</hi> and an <hi>Omen</hi> of the Succeſs of the following Year. For this was the very Thing that made both ſeveral Holy Men, and ſome general Councils, take notice of, and forbid any ſuch Cuſtom: becauſe the Obſervance of it, out of any ſuch Deſign and View, was Superſtitious and Sinful. We are told, in a Place of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0565000600:164"/>
forbid: On the Contrary, it is Praiſe worthy. For tho' the <note n="*" place="bottom">In calendas <hi>Januarias</hi> antiqui patres vehementius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehebantur, non propter iſtas miſſitationes adinvicem, &amp; mutui amoris pignora, ſed propter diem idolis dicatum: Propter ritus quoſdam profanos, &amp; ſacrilegos in illa ſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate adhibitos. <hi>Mountacut.

If then I ſend a New-Year's Gift to my Friend, it ſhall be a Token of my Friendſhip; if to my Benefactor, a Token of my Gratitude; if to the <hi>Poor,</hi> (which at this Time muſt never be forgot) it ſhall be to make their Hearts ſing for Joy, and give Praiſe and Adoration to <hi>the Giver of all good Gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANOTHER old Cuſtom at this Time, is the wiſhing of a <hi>good New-Year,</hi> either when a New-Year's Gift is preſented, or when Friends meet, or when a New-Year's Song is ſung at

Friends and Chriſtmas-Gambols. The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places, tho' the End of them is much the ſame in all; namely, to do honour to the Memory of the <hi>Eaſtern Magi,</hi> whom they ſuppoſe to have been Kings. In <note n="*" place="bottom">In <hi>Gallia</hi> unus ex miniſtris, &amp;c.—Idem in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hoſpin. in Epiphan.</hi>

In <hi>Germany,</hi> they obſerve the ſame Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities, where the Students and Citizens create one of themſelves <hi>King,</hi> and provide a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Banquet for him, and give him the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of a <hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>ſtranger Gueſt.</hi> Now this is anſwerable to that Cuſtom of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnalia,</hi> of <hi>Maſters</hi> making <hi>Banquets</hi> for their <hi>Servants,</hi> and waiting on them; and no Doubt this Cuſtom has in Part ſprung from that.</p>
               <p>NOT many Years ago, this was a common <hi>Chriſtmas-Gambol</hi> in both our <hi>Univerſities;</hi> and it is ſtill uſual in other Places of our

Land, to give the Name of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queen</hi> to that Perſon, whoſe extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided <hi>Cake,</hi> which is honour'd above the others, with a <hi>Bean</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' this be generally the greateſt of the Twelve, yet the others preceeding are obſerved with Mirth and Jollity, generally to Exceſs. Was this Feaſting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation, and gave more way than it does to the Exerciſes and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties of the Seaſon, it would have nothing in it immoral or ſinful. The keeping up of Friendſhip, and Love, and old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, has nothing in it harmful; but the Misfortune is, Men upon that Bottom, act ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Brutes than Men, and like Heathens than Chriſtians; and the Preſervation of Friendſhip and Love, is nothing elſe but a Pretence for Drunkenneſs, and Rioting, and Wantonneſs And ſuch I am afraid hath been the Obſervation of the Chriſtmas-Holy-days, ſince the holieſt Times of the Chriſtian Church; and the generality of Men have rather look'd

For as the learned Biſhop goes on, <q>
                     <hi>Buchannan</hi> is ſo well pleaſed with this notable Obſervation, that he ſets it down for good Hiſtory, ſaying upon it, that the old <hi>Saturnalia</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd, only the Days increaſed, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>'s Name chang'd to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s: For ſays he, we call the Feaſt <hi>Julia.</hi> But why ſhould the Name of <hi>Saturn</hi> be changed into <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s?

               <p>
                  <hi>BUCHANNAN</hi> ſeems therefore to have a great deal more Malice than Truth on his Side. But however ſuch Revellings, and Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and Extravagances, whether or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the old <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> as are cuſtomary at this Seaſon, do come very near to, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed its Liberties. In particular, what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at this Seaſon, than <hi>for Men to riſe early in the Morning, that they may follow ſtrong Drink, and continue untill Night, till Wine inflame them?

If it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be unclouded and without Rain, it is look'd upon as an Omen of the following Year's Succeſs, if otherwiſe that the Year will be unfortunate. Thus the old Verſe,

                     <l>Clara dies <hi>Pauli,</hi> bona tempora denotat anni,</l>
                     <l>Si fuerint venti, denarrant praelia genti,</l>

               <p>THE Interpretation of which is very well known to be this,
<q>
                     <l>If St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Day be fair and clear,</l>
                     <l>It doth betide a happy Year;</l>
                     <l>If bluſtring Winds do blow aloft</l>
                     <l>Then Wars will trouble our Realm full oft.</l>
                     <l>And if it chance to Snow or Rain,</l>

               <p>HOW St. <hi>Paul's Day</hi> came to have this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Knack of foretelling the good or evil
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0565000600:180"/>
Fortune of the following Year, is no eaſy Matter to find out. The Monks who were undoubtedly the firſt who made this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obſervation, have taken Care it ſhould be handed down to Poſterity, but why and for what Reaſon this Obſervation was to ſtand good, they have taken Care to conceal. In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down <hi>Traditions</hi> from Generation to Generation, which being approved by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judgment, are to be taken for granted; but as far as I hear, they never pretended to an infallible Spirit, in the Study of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. One may therefore, without the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Hereſy, or fear of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> make a little Inquiry into this Affair, and ſee whether it be true or falſe, whether it is built upon any Reaſon or no Reaſon, whether ſtill to be obſerved, or only laugh'd at as a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Dream.</p>
               <p>NOW as it is the Day of that Saint, <hi>the great Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul, I cannot ſee there is any Thing to be built upon. He did indeed <hi>labour more abundantly than all the Apoſtles;</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0565000600:181"/>
that I heard, in the Science of Aſtrology. And why his Day ſhould therefore be a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Almanack</hi> to the World, rather than the Day of any other <hi>Saint,</hi> will be pretty hard to find out. I am ſure there is a good Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and if St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. have not as much Right to Wind or Snow, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>AS it is the Twenty fifth Day of <hi>January,</hi> one would think that could be no Reaſon. For what is that Day more than another? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do give ſome Shew of Reaſon, why Rain ſhould happen about the Time of St. <hi>Swithin,</hi> which is this. About the Time of his Feaſt, which is on the Fourteenth of <hi>July,</hi> there are two rainy <hi>Conſtellations,</hi> which are called <hi>Praecepe</hi> and <hi>Aſellus,</hi> which ariſe <hi>coſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> and generally produce Rain. And to be ſure in the Courſe of the Sign <hi>Aquarius,</hi> there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather, but how theſe can foretell the Deſtiny of the Year, is the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0565000600:182"/>AS then there is nothing in the <hi>Saint</hi> or his Day to prognoſticate any ſuch Thing, I mean, as it is the Day of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Twenty fifth of <hi>January,</hi> ſo I muſt confeſs I cannot find out what may be the Ground of this particular Obſervation. But however thus much is very obvious, that this Obſervation is an exact Copy of that ſuperſtitious Cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, of obſerving one Day as good, and another as bad. For among them, were lucky and unlucky Days; ſome were <hi>dies atri,</hi> and ſome <hi>dies albi;</hi> the <hi>atri</hi> were pointed out in their <hi>Calendar,</hi> with a black Character, the <hi>albi</hi> with a white; the former to denote it a Day of bad Succeſs, the latter a Day of good. Thus have the <hi>Monks</hi> in the dark and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens, and dream'd themſelves into the like Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſteeming one Day more ſucceſsful than another; and ſo according to them, it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon <hi>Childermaſs-Day;</hi> and what Day ſoever that falls on, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a <hi>Munday, Tueſday,</hi> or any other, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be begun on that Day through the Year; St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Day is the Year's <hi>Fortune-Teller,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0565000600:183"/>
St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Day is the Prognoſticator of your Life and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo inſtead of perſwading the People to lay aſide the Whims and Fancies of the Heathen World, they brought them ſo effectually in, that they are ſtill reigning in many Places to this Day.</p>
               <p>BUT of all the Days of the Year, they could not have choſen one ſo little to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For the very Saint, whoſe Day is ſo obſerved, has himſelf cautioned them againſt any ſuch Obſervation: For in the Fourth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galations,</hi> he tells them, how dangerous it was <hi>to obſerve Days and Months, and Times, and Years;</hi> which is not, as ſome would perſwade us, to Caution us againſt the Obſervation of any Day but the <hi>Lord's-Day;</hi> but only that we ſhould not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the aboliſhed Feaſts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor the abominable Feaſts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor their ſuperſtitious Obſervation of fortunate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Days. St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> upon this Place, hath theſe Words, <note n="*" place="bottom">Non itaque dies obſervemus, &amp; annos &amp; menſes, &amp; tempora, ne audiamus ab apoſtolo, timeo vos, ne forte ſine cauſa laboraverim in vobis. Eos enim culpat, qui dicunt, non profiſiſcar, quia poſterus eſt, aut quia luna ſic fertur, vel profiſiſcar, ut proſpera cedant, quia ita ſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet poſitio ſiderum, &amp;c. <hi>Beda ex Auguſtin. in loc.</hi>
                  </note> Let us not obſerve Years,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0565000600:184"/>
and Months, and Times, leaſt we hear the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telling us, I am afraid of you, leaſt I have ſhewn on you labour in Vain. For the Perſons he blames, are thoſe who ſay, I will not ſet forward on my Journey, becauſe it is the next Day after ſuch a Time, or becauſe the Moon is ſo; or I'll ſet forward that I may have Luck, becauſe ſuch is juſt now the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Stars. I will not Traffick this Month, becauſe ſuch a Star preſides, or I will, becauſe it does. I ſhall plant no Vines this Year, becauſe it is Leap-Year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE learned Mr. <hi>Bingham,</hi> has among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, a Quotation from the ſame St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> on theſe ſuperſtitious Obſervations, with which I ſhall conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <q>To this kind, ſays he, belong all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures and Remedies, which the School of Phyſicians reject and condemn; whether in Inchantments, or in certain Marks, which<note n="*" place="margin">Bingham, <hi>16</hi> L.

they call Characters, or in ſome other Things which are to be hanged and bound about the Body, and kept in a dancing Poſture; not for any Temperament of the Body, but for certain Significations, either Ocult, or Manifeſt: Which by a gentler Name, they call Phyſical, that they may not ſeem to affright Men with the Appearance of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but do good in a natural Way: Such are Ear-rings hanged upon the Tip of each Ear, and Rings made of an Oſtriches Bones for the Finger; or when you are told in a Fit of Convulſions, or Shortneſs of Breath, to hold your left Thumb with your right Hand. To which may be added a thouſand vain Obſervations, as, if any of our Members beat; if when two Friends are talking together, a Stone, or a Dog, or a Child, happens to come between them, they tread the Stone to Pieces, as the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Friendſhip, and this is toller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Compariſon of beating an innocent Child that comes between them. But it is more pleaſant, that ſometimes the Childrens Quarrel is revenged by the Dogs; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0565000600:186"/>
Times they are ſo ſuperſtitious, as to dare to beat the Dog that comes between them, who turning again upon him that ſmites him, ſends him from ſeeking a vain Remedy, to ſeek a real Phyſician indeed. Hence proceed likewiſe theſe other Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions: For a Man to tread upon his Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold when he paſſes by his own Houſe, to return back to Bed again, if he chance to ſneeze as he is putting on his Shoes; to return into his Houſe, if he ſtumble at his Going out; if the Rats knaw his Clothes, to be more terrified with the Suſpicion of ſome future Evil, than concerned for the preſent Loſs. He ſays, <hi>Cato</hi> gave a wiſe and ſmart Anſwer to ſuch an one, who came in ſome Conſternation to conſult him, about the Rats having knawed his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; that, ſaid he, is no great Wonder, but it would have been a Wonder indeed, if the Stockings had knawed the Rats. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> mentions this witty Anſwer of a wiſe Heathen, to convince Chriſtians the better of the Unreaſonableneſs and Vanity of all ſuch ſuperſtitious Obſervations. And
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0565000600:187"/>
he concludes, that all ſuch Arts, whether of triffling or more noxious Superſtition, are to be rejected and avoided by Chriſtians, as proceeding originally from ſome pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Society between Men and Devils, and being the Compacts and Agreements of ſuch treacherous and deceitful Friendſhip. The Apoſtle forbids us to have Fellowſhip with Devils; and that, he ſays, reſpects not only Idols, and Things offered to Idols, but all imaginary Signs pertaining to the Worſhip of Idols, and alſo all Remedies, and other Obſervations, which are not appointed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour, but proceed from the private Fancies of Men, and tend to delude the Hearts of poor deluded Mortals. For theſe Things have no natural Virtue in them, but owe all their Efficacy to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Confederacy with Devils: And they are full of peſtiferous Curioſity, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Anxiety, and deadly Slavery. They were firſt taken up, not for any real Power to be diſcerned in them, but gained their Power by Mens obſerving them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0565000600:188"/>
by the Devil's Art they happen dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently to different Men, according to their own Apprehenſions and Preſumptions. For the great Deceiver knows, how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper, and enſnare him by his own Suſpicions and Conſent.</q>

in Honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> for as on the Day of a Woman's being <hi>church'd,</hi> there is no common Entertainment, ſo it ſeems, that this Feaſting was begun in the Times of Popery, by Way of Compliment to the Churching-Day of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>

               <p>AFTER this, he adjures the <hi>Wax Candles,</hi> in Words like theſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">Adjuro te creaturam ceream in nomine Domini no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri &amp; ſanctae Trinitatis, ut ſis extirpatio &amp; depulſio dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli &amp; ſpectrorum ejus, &amp;c. <hi>Hoſpin. ibid.</hi>

               <p>OUR Author upon this, ſays, That this is manifeſt Blaſphemy and Idolatry.

Was the Cuſtom of the Lots now mention'd, uſed as among the Heathens, they would no Doubt be as worthy of Condemnation; but as far as I know, there is but little Credit given to them; tho' that little is too much, and ought to be laid aſide. But if the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was uſed without any Mixture or Allay of Superſtition, as I believe it is in ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet it is often attended with great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and Misfortunes, with Uneaſineſſes to Families, with Scandal, and ſometimes with Ruin.</p>

               <p>THIS Cuſtom of confeſſing to the Prieſt at this Time, was laid aſide by our Church at the Reformation: For Sins are to be confeſs'd to GOD alone, and not to the Prieſt, except when the Conſcience cannot otherwiſe be quieted: Then indeed the Grief is to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Spiritual Guide in private, <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Spark</hi>'s Feaſts and Faſts.</note> From the Story, as deſcribed by St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church took Occaſion, as on this Day, to go in Proceſſion with <hi>Palms</hi> in their Hands, and to denominate it <hi>Palm-Sunday.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT however harmleſs this Cuſtom might have been, in the Times of its firſt Inſtitution, it is certain, that in after Ages it ſunk into Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and groſs Idolatry.

And for a Memory hereof, the Holy Church maketh a ſolemn Proceſſion every Year upon this Day; ſpecially in our Country, when it was Catholick, with the Bleſſed Sacrament reverently carryed, as it were CHRIST up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Aſs,</hi> and ſtrawing of Buſhes and

The like Service, and the like Duties done to him in all other ſolemn Proceſſions of the Bleſſed Sacrament, and otherwiſe, be undoubtedly no leſs grateful.</q> Dr. <note n="*" place="bottom">Fulk. in Loc.

                  <hi>Fulke</hi> upon this, gives this Anſwer: <q>Your <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> Proceſſion was horrible Idolatry, and abuſing of the LORDS Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, who ordained his Supper to be eaten and drunken, not to be carryed about in Proceſſion like a Heatheniſh Idol: But it is pretty Sport, that you make the Prieſts that carryeth this Idol, to ſupply the Room of the <hi>Aſs,</hi> on which CHRIST did ride: Thus you turn the Holy Miſtery of CHRIST'S riding to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to a <hi>May-game</hi> and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Play. And yet you ſay, ſuch Service done to CHRIST is undoubtedly exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grateful; yea, no leſs grateful, than
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0565000600:205"/>
that was done by his Diſciples, at the Time mentioned in the Text: Your Argument and Proof is none, but your bare Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               </p>
               <p>FROM this ſuperſtitious and idolatrous Cuſtom, without all doubt it comes to paſs, that we now and then, on a <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> ſee the young People carrying <hi>Branches of Palms</hi> in their Hands; which they ſeem fond of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Day, and which they as little regard at other Times.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common Cuſtom among the Vulgar and uneducated Part of the World, to riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sun</hi> on <hi>Easter-day,</hi> and walk into the Fields: The Reaſon of which, is to ſee the Sun <hi>Dance;</hi> which they have been told, from an <hi>old Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> always Dances as upon that Day. We read indeed that the Sun once <note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh x.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtood ſtill,</hi> but whether the Sun danced upon the very Day
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0565000600:208"/>
our Saviour roſe on, we cannot tell: It's very probable it did not, becauſe the Scriptures are ſilent; and that it never did ſo ſince, I think we may be well aſſur'd; foraſmuch as never any, that we have heard of, have ſeen any ſuch Thing ſince that Time. If therefore this Tradition hath any Meaning, it muſt be a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> one; that when the Morning proves clear, there is a ſeeming Smile over the Face of Nature, and Earth and Heaven ſhew Tokens of Joy. For as the Earth and her Valleys, by ſtanding thick with Corn, are ſaid, <hi>to laugh and ſing;</hi> ſo, on Account of the Reſurrection, the Heavens and the Sun may be ſaid to Dance for Joy; or as the Pſalmiſt Words it, <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xcvi. 11.

               </p>
               <p>THERE is then, really ſpeaking, nothing in the Dancing of the Sun upon <hi>Easter-Day;</hi> but yet it is a very ancient and commendable Cuſtom to be up early at this Holy Time: And therefore <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> in his <hi>Paſchal Hymn,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0565000600:209"/>
ſings, <note n="*" place="bottom">Vigilemus mane profundo, &amp; pro unguenti hymnum afferamus Domino, &amp; Chriſtum videamus juſtitiae ſolem, omnibus vitam exorientem. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> Let us watch very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and inſtead of Ointment, let us bring an Hymn to our LORD; and let us ſee our CHRIST, the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> who is the Life that riſeth to all Men. And indeed it is the moſt ſeaſonable Time for meditating on our LORD'S Reſurrection, and it's pleaſing Circumſtances. For as the Place where any notable Thing has been tranſacted, ſeldom or never fails to raiſe the Idea of the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo the particular Time, when it was done, does generally produce the ſame Effect. And as the Truth of the Former, was the Occaſion of many holy and religious Men go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note n="†" place="bottom">Fulk. Teſt. Cont. Rhem. Matth. Cap. <hi>28.</hi> in Annot.</note> to viſit the Place of the Sepulchre, and hear it, as it were, ſay, what the Angel did to the Women, <hi>Come, ſee the Place where the LORD lay;</hi> ſo the Truth of the Latter was the Reaſon, why devout and holy Men, did in the beſt Ages of the Church, riſe early in the Morning of the Reſurrection. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians ſpent the Night preceeding
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0565000600:210"/>
it, in Prayers and Praiſes, till the Time of <hi>Cock-crow,</hi> the ſuppoſed Hour of our Saviour's riſing. For as <note n="*" place="bottom">Latinorum concors eſt ſententia, Chriſtum non me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia nocte, verum mane in aurora, canentibus vice Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum angelis, devicta morte &amp; confractis portis inferi, ſurrexiſſe. <hi>Durant. de Rit.

                  <hi>Durant</hi> tells us, it is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally aſſented to by the Latin Church, that after our Saviour had conquer'd Death, and broken the Gates of Hell, he aroſe from the Dead, not at Mid-night, but in the Morning, at the Time of Cock-crow; which not the Cocks, but the Angels themſelves proclaimed. And when theſe Pernoctations were laid aſide, it was the Cuſtom to riſe early, and ſpend the Morning in ſuch a Manner as was ſuita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to the Nature of the Time. The Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church <hi>Aneſteſe;</hi> or, <hi>The LORD is riſen,</hi> and the uſual Anſwer, <hi>The LORD is riſen indeed;</hi> were no doubt the common Salutation of that Morning: And if this preſent Cuſtom of the Vulgar, has had at any Time any laudable Cuſtom for its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, it was, no doubt, this of riſing early to contemplate the more ſeaſonably on the Reſurrection of CHRIST.</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0565000600:211"/>AND now, was this the End of Riſing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at that Holy Time, it would be very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous; but to riſe with the View of the Vulgar, is fooliſh and ridiculous. Would we riſe before the Sun, and prevent the Dawn of Day, our Meditations would be ſtrong and vigorous, and almoſt perſuade us that the real Actions of that Morn, were preſented to our View. For when at that Time, all Things are huſht in Silence, and warp'd in Darkneſs, or but illuminated with the friendly Moon, the <note n="*" place="bottom">Devotae Chriſti faminae, quae illum &amp; vivum dilexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant &amp; mortuum deſiderabant, per noctem ambulantes, juvante luna, venerunt ad monumentum. <hi>Rupert de Divin.

               <p>IN after Ages, when the Church fell into Corruption, and the Subſtance of Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd into the <hi>Shadow of Ceremonies,</hi> the uſual Prayers and Praiſes of the Seaſon, were either much neglected, or but ſuperficially obſerved.

               <p>WHY they ſhould play at <hi>Hand-Ball</hi> at this Time rather than any other Game, I have not been able to find out; but I ſuppoſe it will be readily granted, that this Cuſtom of ſo playing, was the Original of our preſent Recreations and Diverſions on <hi>Eaſter Holy Days,</hi> and in particular of playing at <hi>Hand-Ball for a</hi>

But if this was the Reaſon of this Cuſtom formerly, as it's probable it was, (it having been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Thing, to ſhadow out Times and Seaſons by Emblems;) yet the Cuſtom ſtill continu'd among us, was originally inſtituted upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Bottom.</p>
               <p>AND indeed the <note n="†" place="bottom">Habent hoc a gentibus, antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati, volando per aerem frequenter in puteos &amp; fontes ſpermatizabant, ex quo, &amp;c.

                  </note> Original of this Cuſtom is <hi>Heatheniſh.</hi> For in ancient Times the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0565000600:231"/>
being incited to Luſt through the Heat of the Seaſon, did frequently, as they flew through the Air, Spermatize in the Wells and Fountains. By this Means the Water became infected, and the Air polluted; ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever drank the Waters, was either tormented with a grievious Diſtemper, or loſt his Life. As ſoon as the Phyſicians perceived this, they ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains, and thoſe Things which occaſioned the noiſomeſt Smell, to be burnt, knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away. And foraſmuch as this Cuſtom was obſerved about the Time we now celebrate St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Feaſt, it is therefore ſtill obſerved among ſome People. And agreeable to this it is, that Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us, that <hi>Barnwell,</hi> a Village near <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> got its Name from the Children play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a <hi>Well</hi> on St. <hi>John Baptiſt's Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Cuſtom of kindling ſuch Fires, was ſeverely cenſur'd by the Church: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>Council of Trulius,</hi> this Canon was

                  </note> That if any Clergy-man or Lay-man obſerved the Rite of making on Fires on the <hi>New-Moon,</hi> (which ſome were wont to obſerve, and according to an old Cuſtom, to leap over them in a mad and fooliſh Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,) he ſhould be depoſed, if the Former, if the Latter, he ſhould be excommunicated.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> upon this <hi>Canon</hi> hath theſe Words: The <hi>New-Moon</hi> was always the firſt Day of the Month, and it was Cuſtomary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> to hold then a Feaſt, and pray that they might be lucky du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Continuance of the Month. Of theſe it was, that GOD ſpake by the Prophet: My Soul hateth your <hi>New-Moons</hi> and your Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths. And not only this, but they alſo kindled Fires before their Shops and Houſes, and leaped over them; imagining that all the Evils which had befallen them formerly, would be burnt away, and that they ſhould be more ſucceſsful and lucky afterwards. Now about the Sitting of this Synod, there were ſome of the Chriſtians, who obſerved this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0565000600:233"/>
upon the ſame Accounts that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did, which occaſioned it's being forbid by the Council; and that if a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> was Guilty of it, he ſhould be depoſed; if a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> excommunicated. He alſo tells us, that on St. <hi>John Baptiſt's-Eve,</hi> the Vulgar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night, and leap over them, and draw Lots, and Divine about their good or evil Fortune.</p>
               <p>BUT whatever Reaſon the Heathens had for kindling theſe Fires; whether as <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> thinks, that the luſtful <hi>Dragons</hi> might be driven away, or as the <hi>Canon,</hi> that their evil Fortune might be burnt, it is certain that the Cuſtom was invented and practiſed by them; and becauſe of the Superſtion attending the Obſervation of it, was very juſtly forbidden by the Council. And undoubtedly was the Making of ſuch Fires now, attended with any ſuch Superſtition, it would be equally crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to obſerve them. But <note n="*" place="bottom">Rogos—quos nos Angli <hi>Bonefires</hi> vocamus, &amp; in publica laetitia &amp; gaudiis adhibemus, non obſtante iſto canone. <hi>Mountag.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Feaſt of Sheep-ſheering, is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy, and more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Hoſpitality; indeed it is but little obſerved in theſe Northern Parts, but in the Southern it is pretty common. For on the Day they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſheer their Sheep, they provide a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Dinner for the Sheerers, and for their Friends who come to viſit them on that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; a Table alſo, if the Weather permit, is ſpread in the open Village, for the young People and Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0565000600:236"/>AFTER what Manner ſoever this Cuſtom reach'd us, it is certain it may boaſt of great Antiquity. It is mention'd in the Second Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> as a Feaſt of great Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatneſs of Company. No leſs a Perſon than <hi>Abſalom</hi> the King's Son was the Maſter of this Feaſt, and no leſs Perſons were the Gueſts than the King's Sons, the Brethren of <hi>Abſalom;</hi> nay it was a Feaſt that might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the King himſelf, or ſurely the King would never have been ſo importun'd, never would have receiv'd the Compliment ſo kindly. For 'tis ſaid, <hi>It came to paſs after two full Years, that</hi> Abſalom <hi>had Sheep-ſheerers in</hi> Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazor, <hi>which is beſide</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and</hi> Abſalom <hi>invited all the King's Sons. And</hi> Abſalom <hi>came to the King, and ſaid, Behold, now thy Servant hath Sheep-ſheerers, let the King, I beſeech thee, and his Servants, go with thy Servant. And the King ſaid, Nay, my Son, let us not all go, leſt we be chargeable unto thee.</hi> Of this kind alſo was the Feaſt which <hi>Nabal</hi> made for his Sheerers, when <hi>David was driven</hi> to ſtraits in the Wilderneſs, and ſent his Servants to ask
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0565000600:237"/>
a Preſent of him. He calls the Day it was held on, a <hi>good Day;</hi> that is, a Day of plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eating and Drinking. And therefore <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> anſwer'd the Servants of <hi>David, ſhall I then take my Bread and my Water, and my Fleſh that I have killed for my Sheerers, and give it unto Men, whom I know not whence they be?</hi> And further, it is ſaid in the ſame Chapter, that ſo grand and magnificent was this Feaſt, <hi>that he had a Feaſt in his Houſe, like the Feaſt of a King.</hi> We find alſo in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>Laban</hi> went to ſheer his Sheep, in which Time <hi>Jacob</hi> made his Eſcape, which <hi>Laban</hi> heard not of till the third Day. Of ſuch great Antiquity then is this Cuſtom, and tho' its Antiquity is not of ſuch force as to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate Luxury and Profuſneſs in theſe Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmleſneſs of a moderate Feaſt upon this Occaſion.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Feaſt of this Seaſon is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in Commemoration of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and all the Orders of Angels.

               <p>AT this Seaſon of the Year, it is a general Cuſtom to elect the Governors of <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> to promote Peace among Men, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0565000600:239"/>
guard them againſt Harm from their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fellow Creatures. Whether this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Time of the Year has been choſen for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting them, becauſe then is the Feaſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Guardians and Protectors of Men, and of their Communities and <note n="*" place="bottom">Daniel, C. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> Provinces, is not ſo certain. It is certainer, that when ever it comes, it brings into the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that old Opinion of <hi>Tutelar Angels,</hi> that every Man has his <hi>Guardian Angel;</hi> that is, one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in, till his Going out of Life, who guides him through the Troubles of the World, and ſtrives as much as he can, to bring him to Heaven.</p>
               <p>NOW that good Angels attend good Men is without Diſpute. They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderneſs of Life, and bring them to their deſir'd Homes; they ſurround them in the Seas of Afflictions, and lead them to the Shores of Peace; and as when the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> paſſed through the Red-Sea, <hi>the Cloud became Light to them, but Darkneſs to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0565000600:240"/>
ſo in the troubleſome Seas of this Life, the <hi>Angels</hi> are both the Guides of good Men, and their Protectors from Evil, from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels. And therefore the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſays, <hi>The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them; and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men.</hi> They are alſo ſuppoſed to be that Hedge, which GOD placed about <hi>Job,</hi> which the Devil ſo much complains of; and ſure we are, that when the Eyes of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Servant were open'd, <hi>he ſaw the Mountain full of Chariots and Horſes of Fire round about</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha. That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture ſhews very clearly. But that every Man has his particular <hi>Genius,</hi> ſeems to be founded more upon Tradition, than any Certainty from Scripture. Thus the <hi>Egyptians</hi> believed that every Man had three Angels attending him; the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that every Man had two; the <hi>Romans,</hi> that there was a good and an evil <hi>Genius.</hi> And hence it is that the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet ſays, <hi>Quiſque ſuos patitur manes,</hi> every Man hath his evil <hi>Genius.</hi> And if we may believe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0565000600:241"/>
the Authority of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the evil <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Brutus</hi> appeared to him the Night before the Battle of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and told him he was his evil Genius, and that he would meet him there.</p>
               <p>BUT there are greater Authorities then theſe in Vindication of this Opinion: <hi>Caſalion</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, it may be proved from Scripture, and not only from the Tradition of the <note n="*" place="bottom">Unicuique Deus cuſtodem appoſuit; &amp; aſſerimus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitanter nos ex ſcripturis illam fidem, non gentium nugibus. <hi>Caſſal.</hi> 217. <hi>P. de Vet. Chriſt. Rit.</hi>
                  </note> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. And of this Opinion was <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Theodoret,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE are indeed two Places in the new Teſtament, which have a View to this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt is in the 18th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the 10th Verſe, <hi>Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little Ones: For I ſay unto you, that their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Now becauſe this Place takes notice of the Angels of theſe little Ones, ſome have therefore concluded that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0565000600:242"/>
every Man has his good Angel; at leaſt that good Men have. But now this Concluſion does not certainly follow from theſe Words: For when it is ſaid <hi>their Angels,</hi> it does indeed certainly infer, that the Angels do protect good Men, but not that every Man has his particular Angel. And hence therefore, as one obſerves, St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> makes uſe of theſe Words, <hi>Enteuthen delon,</hi> &amp;c. it is manifeſt that the Saints at leaſt, if not all Men, have their Angels: But he does not hence conclude, that every Man has one. The other Place is in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> where it is ſaid, that when <hi>Peter</hi> was delivered out of Priſon, they would not believe the Maid it was he, but ſaid, <hi>It was his Angel.</hi> It muſt be own'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from this, that it ſeems the Opinion of thoſe in the Houſe, that every Man had his <hi>Guardian Angel;</hi> but this is no Proof of the Things being ſo: It only proves, that it was their Opinion, but not that this Opinion is true. The <hi>Jews</hi> had ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> among them, and what was here ſpoken, was perhaps only according to that Tradition. Beſides we read on the contrary, that ſometimes one and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0565000600:243"/>
the ſame Angel has been ſent to different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; thus <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent to <hi>Daniel, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> and the bleſſed Virgin: Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man; for ſo was <hi>Eliſha</hi> protected; and as we wreſtle <hi>not only againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt all the Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> ſo we have many Angels to aſſiſt and defend us. I ſhall not dare to determine poſitively againſt this Opinion, which has travelled down through ſo many Ages, which has been held by ſo many wiſe and learned Men, and which has ſuch Scriptures brought to its Defence; this I ſhall only ſay, that of the two Opinions, the Latter ſeems to be the more probable; that it ſeems more conſonant to Scripture, that we are attended by a Number of Angels, than by a particular <hi>Tutelar Angel.</hi> But this I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not as neceſſary to be believed. For I am perſwaded there is no fault in believing either the one or the other, as it appears more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable: For whether ſoever we believe, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Protection of Angels, and that ſeems to be all which the Scripture requires.</p>
