            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MY adoption of the word <hi>Pater,</hi> in the Hexham Inſcription, engraved, and facing page 91, vol. I. having been objected to by an anonymous writer, in order to ſhew it was by no means improper or ſingular, I beg leave to refer the reader to the 2d volume of the Archaeologia, page 190, where in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury Inſcription</hi> commented on by <hi>Mr Gough,</hi> the words are <hi>Pater Eccleſiae Saliſbirienſis;</hi> and that writer gives it the antiquity of the beginning of the 12th century, the ſuppoſed perſonage for whom that tomb was erected, Roger third Biſhop of Saliſbury, having been elected A. D. 1102 to that See. <q>His munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to his infant church intitled him to the name of Pater Eccleſiae Saliſbirienſis,</q> are his words. The aera and occaſion agree critically in the two inſtances: others might be pointed out; but this, from its pertinence, may ſeem ſufficient.</p>
            <p>In my account of <hi>Blanchland,</hi> page 119, by former writers I was led into an error, touching the family of Forſters, to whom it formerly appertained. This, I preſume, will appear to be duly rectified, in the account of Bambrough, in this volume.</p>
            <p>The liberal minded reader, I flatter myſelf, will make allowances for ſuch errors as appear in this work, which, conſiſtent with its title, is <hi>a View</hi> of the County.</p>

As being on the borders, this caſtle was ſubject to repeated aſſaults.</p>
               <p>On King Stephen's uſurpation of the Engliſh crown, David of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with great indignation, entered the borders, and among other fortreſſes aſſaulted and took <hi>Carrum,</hi> which Richard of Hexham ſays was by the Engliſh called <hi>Werk.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">This is an error in the Hiſtorian, the places are diſtinct, and ſeparate a conſiderable diſtance.</note> On a treaty held whilſt Stephen lay at <hi>Durham</hi> and David at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> theſe conqueſts were reſtored by the Scotch King, who took as a compenſation, <hi>Carliſle</hi> and ſome other places of leſs import, as additions to the <hi>Earldom of Huntington,</hi> which was then ratified to him: Stephen alſo engaged, that before any diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was made of the <hi>Earldom of Northumberland,</hi> he would cauſe the claim of Henry (David's ſon) thereto, in right of his mother, to be fairly heard by his Judges. David received in marriage, from King Henry I. of England, his brother-in-law, Maud, the eldeſt daughter of Waltheof Earl of Northumberland, from whom Henry his ſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived his pretenſions to that Earldom. Henry, by the reſignation of his father, and King Stephen's ratification, held the Earldom of Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
               <p>The determination of Henry's claim to Northumberland being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and Stephen unwilling to bring it to a fair diſcuſſion, ſenſible of the great power it would give to the Scotch crown, irritated David to ſupport his ſon's pretenſions by force of arms. Stephen's abſence in Normandy favoured his purpoſe; and ſoon after Eaſter, in the year 1137, he levied a great army, with intent to invade England. The northern Barons, with Thurſtan Archbiſhop of York, aſſembled the Engliſh forces at Newcaſtle; and the Archbiſhop proceeding to Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, then in the poſſeſſion of the Scotch King, in conference with David and his ſon, prevailed on them to enter into a truce till Stephen's return, when it was preſumed the matter in conteſt would be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably accommodated: but Stephen perſiſting in a denial of Henry's right, war immediately enſued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0085300202:5"/>The winter was ſet in, when David, flattered with hopes of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in England, a plot <note n="*" place="bottom">Ordericus Vitalis.—L. 13. p. 912.</note> having been laid to maſſacre all the <hi>Normans,</hi> and deliver the kingdom to him, who was neareſt heir in the <hi>Saxon line,</hi> not regarding the rigour of the ſeaſon, diſpatched his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew William, ſon of Duncan, with part of his army, againſt the Caſtle of Wark.<note n="†" place="bottom">Richard of Hexham, John of Hexham.—Redpath's Border Hiſtory.</note>

               <p>William inveſted this fortreſs early in the morning, and David with a numerous army and engines of war, advanced ſoon afterwards to maintain the ſiege. This inveſtiture continued three weeks, during which time the moſt vigorous aſſaults were ſuſtained by the garriſon, under command of Jordan de Buſſis, nephew of Walter D'Eſpec, Lord of Wark.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>Walter D'Eſpec had great eſtates in Yorkſhire, and was founder of the Abbey of Rievalle, which he filled with Monks from St. Barnard. The ſcite of this abbey is by ancient writers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be melancholy and deſert, on a tract of land called Blackowmor, on the banks of the river Rie, from whence the monaſtery had the name of Rievalle. Rie empties itſelf into Derwent. The abbey, of which there are fine remains to this day, ſtands near Helmſley, in Yorkſhire. We find a particular deſcription of Walter D'Eſpec given by Ethelred or Ailred, ſecond Abbot of Rievalle, an elegant and ſpirited writer, in his Hiſtory of the Battle of the Standard. He is there repreſented as a perſon of the firſt eminence and eſteem in the Engliſh army, harangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them before the battle from the carriage in which the famous ſtandard was erected. <q>Vir ſenex et plenus Dierum, acer ingenio, in Conſiliis prudens, in Bello Amicitiam Sociis, fidem ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Regibus ſervans.

                     <p>An account of the diſpoſitions made by both armies before the battle known by the name of <hi>Bellum Standardi,</hi> as collected from Hiſtorians of character, may not be diſagreeable to the reader in this place, though not pertinent to this work.</p>
                     <p>This expedition of <hi>David</hi>'s was unfortunate to the <hi>Scotch:</hi> they were joined by <hi>Euſtace Fitz-John Lord of Alnwick,</hi> who reſented <hi>Stephen</hi>'s taking from him <hi>Bambrough,</hi> and who hoped to have regained that fortreſs by the arms of the Scottiſh King. The <hi>caſtle</hi> ſuſtained the aſſault of the whole army, and remained impregnable. <hi>David</hi> with fire and ſword laid waſte the country to <hi>Durham,</hi> where he was joined by the men of <hi>Galloway, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Carliſle,</hi> augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his army ſo, that it conſiſted of 26,000 men at the leaſt. He was oppoſed near <hi>Northaller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> by a much ſmaller number, chiefly conſiſting of the nobles and men of Yorkſhire, headed by their <hi>Archbiſhop Thurſton,</hi> whoſe preſence animated them to the higheſt pitch of bravery. The maſt of a ſhip, having on its top a croſs, wherein was the conſecrated hoſt in a ſilver pix, and the banners of St. Peter, St. John of Beverley, and St. Wilfrid of Ripon waving below it, was erected on the beam of a vaſt chariot. Around this ſtandard, and ſome of them upon the carriage on which it ſtood, were placed the more aged of the Engliſh Barons, and with theſe <hi>Roger de Moubrai</hi> the infant Earl of <hi>Northumberland. Roger</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Negel de Albanei,</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0085300202:6"/>who at the battle of <hi>Tinchebrai,</hi> in Normandy, took Duke Robert priſoner; for which and other great ſervices, King Henry rewarded him by a gift of the lands of <hi>Robert de Moubrai</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which had been forfeited on account of his rebellion againſt William Rufus. His preſence drew around him all his vaſſals, who made no inconſiderable part of the Engliſh army. Immediately before the battle, <hi>Ralph Biſhop of the Orkneys,</hi> deputed by the aged and infirm <hi>Thurſtan,</hi> having aſſured the army that by fighting bravely they would purchaſe the remiſſion of their ſins, did, on receiving their confeſſions, actually pronounce their abſolution, joining to it his benediction; at the ſame time the prieſts in their white veſtments carrying croſſes and relics, went among the ranks, encouraging the ſoldiers by their exhortations and prayers. Theſe pious acts were accompanied with a wiſe arrangement of the Engliſh warriors, adapted to ſuſtain and repel the firſt fierce onſet of their enemies.

The King however fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſedition, at a time when it might have proved ſo fatal, was obliged to grant theſe troops their requeſt.

The bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conflicts were all after one mode, rendered horrible by ravage and rapine. David, after his departure from before <hi>Wark,</hi> led his forces to the weſtern parts of Northumberland, where he ſpread deſolation and ruin, and marked his progreſs as far as Tyne with acts of ſavage cruelty.</p>
               <p>To oppoſe theſe invaders, Stephen at the head of a numerous army advanced to <hi>Wark,</hi> which obliged David to abandon Northumberland, and prepare to defend his own territories: but Stephen, apprized of a plot which was laid to entrap him at <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> returned to England without effecting any thing againſt his enemy. David ſeeing the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh forces had abandoned the border, after taking and demoliſhing <hi>Norham,</hi> advanced againſt <hi>Wark,</hi> to revenge an inſult the garriſon had committed, by taking ſome baggage, and giving annoyance to his troops, marching under his ſon Henry. His ſucceſs in this ſecond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was no better than in his former aſſault; he exerted his powers, employed every engine the art of war had introduced, and with much

               <p>David ſoon after had a dreadful defeat near <hi>Northallerton,</hi> at the <hi>Battle of the Standard;</hi> after which he retreated with the ſhattered remains of his troops to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> through a country enraged at the barbarities he had been guilty of in his former incurſion: the peaſants in every avenue revenging on his flying troops, the ſufferings their families had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. After a ſhort reſpite, and a collection of his ſcattered army at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> he commanded the ſiege of <hi>Wark</hi> to be reſumed, in which many new-invented engines and machines were employed. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged with unparallelled fortitude ſuſtained the ſhock: their ſkilfulneſs is as admirable as their courage, for they loſt but one Knight, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity in attacking a machine, expoſed him to numbers of aſſailants, in the midſt of whom he fell, after teſtifying the higheſt human valour. The ſlaughter made by the garriſon was terrible; inſomuch that David, relaxing his rigorous command, ceaſed all aſſaults, and again formed a ſtrong blockade. The garriſon were reduced to great extremities; they had killed their horſes, and ſalted their fleſh for food, and when that was nearly conſumed, reſolved, as ſoon as all proviſion was exhauſted, to make a general ſally, and cut their paſſage through the lines of the aſſailants, or die ſword in hand. During this interval, <hi>Walter D'Eſpec,</hi> their Lord, willing to preſerve ſo brave a corps, ſent the Abbot of Rie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valle with his command, that the garriſon ſhould ſurrender the place: on whoſe arrival a treaty was entered into, in conſequence of which the garriſon capitulated, and were permitted to march out of the caſtle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arms, with 20 horſes provided them by the Scotch King. On this evacuation, the caſtle was demoliſhed, and the fortifications were raſed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>King Edward,</hi> on the breach of fealty by John Baliol, in the year 1296, having levied a great army, advanced towards the Scotch bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and halting at <hi>Bamburgh,</hi> received intelligence that Robert de Roſs, Lord of <hi>Wark,</hi> had abandoned his caſtle, and gone over to the Scots, being enamoured of a Scotch woman, whoſe affection he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his duty and allegiance: his brother William remaining in the fortreſs, diſpatched a meſſenger to require immediate aid of the King, as he apprehended Robert would attempt to deliver <hi>Wark</hi> to the enemy. King Edward immediately ordered 1000 men to march to ſuſtain William and his garriſon, who, on their arrival, were attacked in their quarters in the night, in a ſmall village called <hi>Preſtfeu,</hi> by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Roſs, with a detachment from <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> who burnt the village, and put the reinforcement to the ſword. King Edward ſoon after this diſaſter marched with his whole army to <hi>Wark,</hi> where he continued to celebrate the feſtival of Eaſter.</p>
               <p>In the reign of King Edward II. 1318, <hi>Wark</hi> was taken by the Scots, under King Robert Brus, by aſſault. In Leland's Collecta. p. 548, it is ſaid, that the Scottes came into the Marches of England, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the caſtelles of Wark and Harbottle.</p>
               <p>As King David Bruce with his victorious army was returning from Durham in the ſummer of the year 1341, where he had imbrued his hands in the horrid maſſacre of all ages and both ſexes, had ſpoiled and plundered the ſacred places, and put the religious to miſerable deaths, the rear of his army paſſing the caſtle of <hi>Wark</hi> loaden with ſpoils, were ſeen by the garriſon with the greateſt indignation. Sir William Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague was then Governor, and the Counteſs of Saliſbury, whoſe Lord the fortreſs then belonged to, reſided there. The Governor with 40 horſemen made a ſally, attended with conſiderable ſlaughter, bringing into the caſtle 160 horſes laden with booty. King David, incenſed at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0085300202:9"/>
this inſult, led his army againſt the caſtle, and made a general aſſault, but met with a repulſe attended with great bloodſhed. David then prepared to fill up the ditches, and bring his battering engines to play upon the walls: the imminent danger of the garriſon rendered it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſend information of their ſituation to the Engliſh Monarch, who was approaching the borders with a conſiderable army. The place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe inveſted, rendered ſuch an attempt perilous, but it was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Governor himſelf, on a fleet horſe, in the darkneſs and tumult of a ſtormy night: he paſſed through the enemy's lines, and carried intelligence to King Edward, who redoubled his ſpeed to relieve the place. The Scotch Chieftains, unwilling to hazard the treaſures they had reaped in their expedition, perſuaded the King to raiſe the ſiege and paſs the Tweed; which was done only ſix hours before the van of the Engliſh army appeared. The joy of the Counteſs of Saliſbury for this relief, and her pleaſing deportment whilſt ſhe entertained the King at Wark, were the beginning of an amour, to which the famous inſtitution of <hi>the order of the Garter</hi> is ſaid to owe its origin.</p>
               <p>In the reign of King Richard II. 1383,<note n="*" place="bottom">A. D. 1383 &amp; 7 Rich. Scotti ceperunt caſtellum de Werk ſuper Fluv Twede &amp; depraedatum incenderunt. Lel. Collecta. 252.</note> it was beſieged by the Scots, and part of the fortifications deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Soon after the acceſſion of King Henry IV. the truce made with Richard II. expiring, the Scots made an incurſion, in which they took the caſtle of Wark, and after holding it ſome time, utterly demoliſhed the works. It was a fortreſs of too much conſequence to be neglected, and therefore we find it ſoon after reſtored and in a ſtate of defence: for in the ſame reign it ſuſtained many ſhocks, with various degrees of fortune. In 1419, in the abſence of the King of England, who was then in France, hoſtilities being commenced on the borders, William Haliburton of Faſt Caſtle took the caſtle of <hi>Wark,</hi> which was then in the keeping of Robert Ogle, and put all the garriſon to the ſword; but it was ſoon recovered by the Engliſh, who, from a perfect knowledge of the place, made their way by a ſewer which led from the kitchen into the Tweed, and ſurprizing the garriſon, put them all to death, in revenge for their cruelty on Ogle's troops.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0085300202:10"/>In the reign of Henry VI. 1460, the Scots gathered great booty on the Marches, and among many other caſtles which they aſſailed, <hi>Wark</hi> was taken and demoliſhed.</p>
               <p>The caſtle was afterwards repaired by the Earl of Surry, and in the year 1523, in the 15th year of the reign of King Henry VIII. the Scotch army laying at Coldſtream, reſolved to attempt the reduction of <hi>Wark,</hi> under the command of the Duke of Albany, Sir John Liſle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Governor. Buchanan the Hiſtorian, being preſent at the ſiege, gives the following deſcription of the caſtle: <q>In the innermoſt area was a tower of great ſtrength and height; this was encircled by by two walls, the outer including a large ſpace, into which the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the country uſed to fly, with their cattle, corn, and flocks, in time of war; the inner of much ſmaller extent, but fortified more ſtrongly by ditches and towers. It had a ſtrong garriſon, good ſtore of artillery and ammunition, and other things neceſſary for defence.</q> The Duke of Albany ſent againſt it battering cannon, and a choſen band of Scots and French, to the number of 4000, under the command of Andrew Ker of Fairnherſt. The French carried the outer incloſure at the firſt aſſault, but they were diſlodged by the garriſon ſetting fire to the corn and ſtraw laid up therein. The beſiegers ſoon recovered it, and by their cannon effected a breach in the inner wall. The French with great intrepidity mounted the breach, ſuſtaining great loſs by the ſhot of thoſe who poſſeſſed the tower or keep, and being warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the forces that defended the inner ballium, were obliged to retire after a great ſlaughter. The attack was to be renewed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding day, but a fall of rain in the night, which ſwelled the Tweed, and threatened to cut off the retreat of the aſſailants to the main army, and the approach of the Earl of Surry, who before lay at Alnwick with a large force, obliged the Duke to relinquiſh his deſign, and repaſs the Tweed.</p>
               <p>The preſent remains of <hi>Wark</hi> do not in any wiſe ſtrike the traveller with an idea of ſo formidable a fortreſs, as it aſſuredly was for many centuries. At what time it was diſmantled, and thus totally deſtroyed, I have not been able to learn; but it is probable it was one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds ordered to be demoliſhed by King James VI. of Scotland, on his acceſſion to the crown of England.</p>

A little hill on the eaſt of <hi>Ford,</hi> covered the Engliſh army from the obſervation of their enemies; whilſt, from this eminence, the Lord Admiral obtained a diſtinct view of all the Scottiſh army, and of all the eminences near it. The next morning the Engliſh made ſome marches to amuſe the enemy, and then gained the ground which cut off <hi>James</hi>'s retreat to Scotland. By this poſition of his forces, <hi>Surry</hi> had an acceſs opened to the Scottiſh camp, much leſs difficult and dangerous than on the other ſide of <hi>Flod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> The batteries raiſed by the Scotch to command the Bridge of of <hi>Ford,</hi> of which the veſtiges ſtill remain, were now rendered of no uſe. The Scots, deluded either by the treacherous advice of one <hi>Giles Muſgrave,</hi> who engaged the King's confidence, and abuſed the royal ear, or depending that <hi>Surry,</hi> by his mode of marching the army, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to gain <hi>Berwick,</hi> and avoid a battle, appeared now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by the manoeuvres of the Engliſh, which beſpoke their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to come to an engagement; in order to receive them with the greater advantage, and to gain the ground they ſuppoſed the Engliſh would attempt to poſſeſs, on the weſtern ſide of the hill, the Scots ſet fire to their huts on the eaſtern ſide, and made a motion to the weſt. The ſmoke being driven between the armies, concealed the progreſs the Engliſh were making, till they had almoſt gained the foot of the hill. <hi>Surry</hi> obſerved the confuſion his approach had occaſioned among the Scotch troops, and finding the aſcent of the hill ſhort and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſteep, determined not to delay the onſet.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh were diſpoſed in three diviſions; the van under <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> the General's eldeſt ſon, Lord Admiral of England, the right wing being led by <hi>Sir Edmund Howard,</hi> brother to <hi>Lord Thomas,</hi> and Knight Marſhal of the army. The middle diviſion, or main battle, was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0085300202:16"/>
led by the <hi>Earl of Surry</hi> in perſon, and the rear by <hi>Sir Edward Stanley.</hi> The <hi>Lord Dacres</hi> commanded a body of reſerve, conſiſting of horſemen. The ordnance was placed in the front of the battle, and in the openings of the ſeveral diviſions. After they had paſſed the little brook of <hi>Sandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Lord Admiral perceiving the Scots approaching towards him, drawn up in four great bodies, armed with long ſpears, like Mooriſh pikes, ſent to his father the Agnus Dei that hung at his breaſt, as a token, accompanying a requeſt, that as the van of the army was not ſufficiently ſtrong or extenſive to receive the brunt of the whole Scottiſh army, his father would bring up the forces of his diviſion, and range them in a line with the van. The Engliſh General, convinced of the expediency of this diſpoſition, immediately came forward with his forces, and drew them up to the left of thoſe of his ſon. The mode in which the Scots advanced to battle is variouſly deſcribed: Paulus Jovius ſays, they were formed in five ſquare bodies, ſo that the third of thoſe in which the royal ſtandard was erected, and all the chief men fought, was incloſed on each ſide by a double line, forming, as it were, two wings. Comparing the ſeveral accounts, it ſeems moſt probable that the battalia was thus arranged: The van of the Scotch army led on the right by <hi>Alexander Gordon Earl of Huntley,</hi> and on the left by the <hi>Earls of Crawford and Montroſe,</hi> and ſome ſay <hi>Lord Hume:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was in the center or main body: a third diviſion was commanded by the <hi>Earls of Lenox and Argyle</hi> with whom were <hi>Mackenzie, Maclean, and the Highlanders. Adam Hepburn Earl of Bothwell,</hi> with his kindred and clan, and the men of Lothian formed a body of reſerve. They had with them a large train of artillery. The Engliſh artillery began to play, which made a dreadful carnage, whilſt the Scotch cannon, from their high ſituation, took little or no effect, the ſhot going over the heads of the Engliſh. This obliged the Scotch to advance, the <hi>Earls of Lenox and Argyle,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Lord Hume,</hi> moving with a body of ten thouſand ſpearmen, ſupported by ſome horſe, down the hill towards <hi>Branxion,</hi> made a fierce attack on the wing commanded by <hi>Sir Edmund Howard.</hi> The ſhock was violent, the Scots prevailed, and <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> was reduced to the laſt extremity, himſelf beaten to the ground the third time, and in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent peril of Death, when <hi>Lord Dacres, and Heron the Baſtard,</hi> who had joined the Engliſh army with a troop of fierce outlaws, his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, came in time to his reſcue. <hi>Sir Edmund,</hi> thus relieved, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately joined the body commanded by his brother <hi>Lord Thomas,</hi> and they advancing againſt the <hi>Earls of Crawford and Montroſe,</hi> whoſe troops were armed with ſpears, put them to the rout, and both the Earls were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0085300202:17"/>
ſlain. On the other ſide of the field, <hi>Sir William Stanley,</hi> with the forces from Lancaſhire and Cheſhire, being bowmen, forced the Scots to break their array, and deſcend to cloſer fight, in more even ground, where they were ſoon thrown into confuſion, and put to flight, after leaving the <hi>Earls of Argyle and Lenox</hi> with the ſlain. The Engliſh attributed this ſucceſs to the archers, but the Scotch writers alledge, the miſcarriage of this part of their army was owing to the undiſciplined ferocity of the Highlanders, who, animated by the ſucceſs of the attack made on that wing of the Engliſh army commanded by <hi>Sir Edmund Howard,</hi> could not be reſtrained from ruſhing impetuouſly forward, in an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and open manner, notwithſtanding the ſignals, cries, and menaces of the French Ambaſſador <hi>La Motte,</hi> who perceived the conſequence of ſuch an improper and looſe attack. <hi>The King</hi> of Scotland, whoſe bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kindled to extravagance of courage at the perils which now ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſurround him, deaf to every advice and remonſtrance, preſſed forward, and expoſed his royal perſon to all the dangers of the field: being ſuſtained by <hi>Bothwell</hi> and his band, he charged on foot, at the head of the beſt of his troops, whoſe armour reſiſted the arrows of the Engliſh archery; he preſſed forward to the ſtandards of the <hi>Earl of Surry,</hi> and with ſuch ardour and valour, that they were nearly gained by this heroic phalanx: but at length the wings of the Scotch army being totally routed, all the Engliſh forces were employed againſt this valiant band, who were ſurrounded by the coming in of <hi>Lord Dacre</hi>'s horſe in the rear.</p>
               <p>A conſiderable body of Borderers, commanded by <hi>Lord Hume,</hi> ſtood aloof during the moſt arduous part of the battle; and when he was required by <hi>Huntley,</hi> to attempt the King's deliverance from the circle of his enemies, he anſwered, <q>that the man did well that day that ſtood and ſaved himſelf.</q> Before the battle the <hi>old Earl of Angus,</hi> anxious to diſſuade the King from engaging, was told by his Sovereign, <hi>that if he was afraid he might go home.</hi> The Earl judging it repugnant to his honour, to fight under the ſtandard of a Prince from whom he had received ſo great an affront, requeſted he might be diſmiſſed the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but as pledges of his loyalty and firm attachment to <hi>James,</hi> left as hoſtages of his honour, a large body of kindred and dependents, with his two ſons, who both fell in the battle.</p>

                     <p>In the ingenious notes by the Rev. Mr Lamb of Norham, to the ancient poem on Flodden Field Fight, we have the following conciſe account of Howard Earl of Surry. "Thomas Howard Earl of Surry was knighted for his remarkable courage at the battle of Barnet; he was made Knight of the Garter 1 King Richard III. He was taken priſoner at the battle of Boſworth, and committed to the Tower by King Henry VII. and attainted by Parliament. King Henry aſked him how he durſt bear arms in behalf of that tyrant Richard? To which he anſwered, <q>He was my crowned King, and if the parliamentary authority of England ſet the crown upon a ſtock, I will fight for that ſtock; and as I fought then for him, I will fight for you, when you are eſtabliſhed by the ſaid authority.</q> In the rebellion againſt the King by the Earl of Lincoln, the Lieutenant of the Tower offered him the keys of the Tower, in order to ſet himſelf at liberty; but he replied, <q>that he would not be delivered by any power, but by that which had committed him.</q> After he had been in priſon three years and a half, the King gave him his liberty; and knowing his worth and nice ſenſe of honour, took him into favour, and delivered up to him all his eſtates. The Earl took all occaſions of relieving the oppreſſed ſubjects, and was accounted one of the ableſt and greateſt men in the kingdom. The Scots made an irruption into England, and beſieged Norham Caſtle: the Earl raiſed the ſiege, took the caſtle of Ayton, and made all the country round a deſert. James IV. of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, incenſed at this, ſent a Herald with a challenge to him; to which he made a ſenſible and ſpirited anſwer, <q>that his life belonged to the King, whilſt he had the command of his army; but when that was ended he would fight the King on horſeback or on foot; adding, that if he took the King priſoner in the combat, he would releaſe him without any ranſom; and that if the King ſhould vanquiſh him, he would then pay ſuch a ſum for his liberty, as was competent for the degree of an Earl.</q> In the year 1501 the Earl was Lord High Treaſurer. In June, 1502, Margaret the King's daughter, a beautiful Princeſs, at the age of 14 years, was attended by the Earl of Surry, with a great company of Lords, Ladies, Knights, and Eſquires, to the town of Berwick: ſhe was conveyed to St Lambert's church in Lamyr Moor, where King James, attended by the chief Nobility, received her, and carried her to Edinburgh. The next day after her arrival there, ſhe was with great ſolemnity married unto him, in the preſence of all his Nobles. The King gave great entertainments to the Engliſh, whom the Scotch Noblemen and Ladies far outſhone, both in coſtly apparel, rich jewels, maſſive chains, habiliments ſet with goldſmith's work garniſhed with pearl, and ſtones of price, and in gallant and well-trapped horſes. They made alſo great feaſts for the Engliſh Lords and Ladies, and ſhewed them juſtling and other pleaſant paſtimes, as good as could be deviſed after the manner of Scotland. Divers Ladies of Queen Margaret's train remained in Scotland, and were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards well married to Noblemen. In 1507, two years before the death of King Henry VII. the Earl was Ambaſſador to the King of France; 2 King Henry VIII. he was made Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal for life; in 1511 he was one of the Commiſſioners at the Court of Arragon. When King Henry VIII. heard that the Scots were preparing to invade England, he ſaid, <q>that he had left a Nobleman who would defend his ſubjects from inſults.</q> After the battle of Flodden, the Earl himſelf preſented King James's armour to the Queen Regent. When the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from France, he gave the Earl an augmentation of his arms, viz. to bear on the bend the upper part of a red lion depicted in the ſame manner as the arms of Scotland, pierced thro' the month with an arrow. In 1514 the Earl was created Duke of Norfolk, and a grant was given him in ſpecial tail of ſeveral manors. He hated and oppoſed Cardinal Wolſey, becauſe he adviſed the King to purſue meaſures hurtful to the liberties of the people: finding that his oppoſition prevailed nothing, he reſigned his poſt, and retired from Court. He died in the year 1524.</p>

                     <p>It was not unuſual, in ancient times, for the Dignitaries of the Church to attend their King in the wars; they were bound to do it by the feudal law. They held the temporalities of their benefices of the King as Barons, by the tenure of military ſervice. It appears from many grants to the Clergy, that according to the eſtabliſhment of the church of Scotland, the clerical and military character were not inconſiſtent. King Edward III. 1368, ordered all the Clergy to take up arms.</p>

who were taken priſoners. The royal body was not diſcovered till the next day, when, in a circle of his ſlain Nobility, he was found by <hi>Lord Dacres,</hi> who was well acquainted with his perſon. After the royal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains were removed to Berwick, Sir William Scott, Chancellor of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Sir John Foreman, priſoners there, acknowledged the body of their late Sovereign. He was wounded in many parts, pierced alſo by ſeveral arrows; his left hand was almoſt ſevered from the arm by two ſeveral wounds, and his neck was laid open to the middle. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate was this race of Kings! James I. was murdered by the Earl of Athol, his uncle, in his palace. James II. died by the burſting of a piece of his own ordnance. James III. was ſlain by rebels, headed by his own ſon, James IV. whoſe miſerable death is above deſcribed. His body was embalmed at Berwick, and from thence conveyed to the monaſtery of <hi>Sheene,</hi> where, at the diſſolution, according to Stowe, it remained uninterr'd, and then thrown into a waſte room among lumber.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>King James was killed in the 25th year of his reign, and the 39th of his age. He was of a majeſtic countenance, of a middle ſize, and a ſtrong body. By the uſe of exerciſe, a ſlender diet, and much watching, he could eaſily bear the extremities of weather, fatigue, and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. He excelled in fencing, ſhooting, and riding. He delighted in fine horſes, the breed of which he endeavoured to propagate in his own country, as it appears from ſeveral letters ſtill extant, which he wrote to the Kings of Spain and Poland, entreating them that they would ſuffer his ſervants to buy ſuch horſes and mares as their reſpective dominions afforded. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he made them preſents of hunting dogs, and of the famous little ambling horſes called galloways, bred in the mountains and iſles of Scotland. About the year 1508, the Lord of Campvere ſent him many fine large Flanders horſes; and alſo King Henry VII. ſeveral fine horſes and rich furniture. He was of a quick wit, which by the negligence of thoſe times was uncultivated with letters. He had great ſkill in the art of curing wounds, which was then common to the Scotch Nobles, always in arms. He was of a high ſpirit, of eaſy acceſs, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and mild; juſt in his judicial deciſions, merciful in his puniſhments, which he inflicted upon offenders always unwillingly. He was poor, from his profuſion in ſumptuous buildings, public ſhews, entertainments, and gifts.</p>
                     <p>As long as he lived he wore an iron chain girdle, to which he every year added one link, in teſtimony of his ſorrow for having appeared at the head of the rebels who killed his father, contrary to his expreſs orders. Biſhop Leſley concludes his Life of James with telling us, that the Scotch nation loſt in him, a King moſt warlike, juſt, and holy. Certain it is, that he was ſo dear to his ſubjects, that his death was more lamented than that of his predeceſſor ever was.</p>
                     <p>He married Margaret the eldeſt daughter of King Henry VII. by whom he left two ſons, the eldeſt not two years old. About a year after King James's death, ſhe married Archibald Douglas Earl of Angus, by whom ſhe had a beautiful daughter, Margaret, born A. D. 1516, at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle Caſtle, in Northumberland, afterwards the wife of Matthew Stewart Earl of Lenox, and by him mother to Henry Lord Darnley, father to King James I.</p>

                           <hi>St. Gregory</hi> in his letter to <hi>King Ethelbert</hi> in the year 601, had enjoined him to deſtroy the heathen idols, their temples, and high places, that their influence might be taken away from the people, and their memory effaced. But on reviewing the eſtate of the inhabitants, their ſuperſtitions, and ſettled and habitual cuſtoms, he thought it expedient not to purſue meaſures ſo violent and alarming at firſt; and therefore in a letter wrote to <hi>Mellitus,</hi> an Abbot, who was upon his voyage to <hi>Britain,</hi> he orders him upon his arrival to inform <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that on more mature deliberation, he had reſolved that the <hi>Pagan temples</hi> in Britain ſhould not be pulled down, it being ſufficient that the <hi>Idols</hi> were taken away: therefore <hi>the places of the heathen worſhip</hi> were to be purified with a libation of <hi>holy water, altars</hi> were to be erected therein, and <hi>relics</hi> placed under them; for if theſe <hi>temples</hi> were well built, it was fit the property of them ſhould be altered, the worſhip of Devils aboliſhed, and the ſolemnities changed to the ſervice of the true God: that when the natives perceived thoſe religious ſtructures remained ſtanding, they might keep to the place without retaining the error; and be leſs ſhocked upon their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon chriſtianity, by frequenting the <hi>temples</hi> they had been uſed to eſteem. And his injunctions were, that ſince it had been their <hi>cuſtom</hi> to ſacrifice oxen to the Devils they adored, this uſage ought to be refined on, and altered to an innocent practice. He recommends, that on <hi>the anniverſary of the Saints</hi> whoſe <hi>relics</hi> are lodged there, or upon the return of the day on which <hi>the church was conſecrated,</hi> the people ſhould erect booths about the churches lately reſcued from idolatry, provide a <hi>feaſt,</hi> and keep <hi>a chriſtian holiday:</hi> not ſacrificing their cattle to evil ſpirits, but killing them for their own refreſhment, and praiſing God for the bleſſing: and thus by allowing them ſenſual gratifications, they may reliſh chriſtianity the better, and be raiſed by degrees to the more noble pleaſures of the mind; for unpoliſhed and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not to be withdrawn from their habits all at once. God when he diſcovered himſelf to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> did not forbid them the cuſtomary rites of <hi>ſacrificing,</hi> but purified the ſervice to himſelf. Greg. Epiſt. Lib. 9. Epiſt. 71. Thus the Pope thought it expedient to bend to the prejudices of the new converts, as a more likely expedient to reconcile them to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity than rigid meaſures, the abolition of their old cuſtoms, and forcing the people from one extreme to another.</p>

The Scotch forces having refuſed to proceed on the incurſion they had entered upon, Lent being come, retreated from the eaſtern part of the county of Durham, where they had committed dreadful depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0085300202:32"/>
and in their paſſage home undertook the ſiege of this caſtle, which was at that time thinly garriſoned, having only nine Knights of their corps. A gallant defence was made for ſome time, but no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours arriving, the place was ſurrendered, and the troops permitted to retire to Durham. David propoſed to the Biſhop to reſign his caſtle, if he would renounce his allegiance to Stephen, in favour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Maude, which the Biſhop refuſing, he cauſed the town and caſtle of Norham to be deſtroyed.—Lyt.

               <p>The <hi>caſtle</hi> and fortifications were reſtored by <hi>Hugh Pudſey, Biſhop of Durham,</hi> in the year 1174, at the inſtance of his kinſman King Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen: he then built the <hi>great tower,</hi> which remains to this day: but this Biſhop in the ſucceeding reign purchaſed his peace with the King of England, after certain defections in favour of the Scotch, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up to him this <hi>caſtle.</hi> In 1176, we find the <hi>caſtle</hi> ſtill in the hands of the Crown, <hi>William de Neville</hi> being Keeper or Governor, who was ſworn upon the relics of Saints, that upon the event of the King's death, he would deliver it up to the Biſhop, on receiving orders from Richard de Lucy, the Biſhop of Wincheſter, or the Biſhop of Ely; and if the Biſhop ſhould die, that the caſtle ſhould be reſtored to St. Cuthbert's church at Durham, that the rights of that church might not be impaired. The caſtle of Berwick at the ſame time was governed by Geofrey de Neville, who was under the like oath in reſpect thereof.</p>
               <p>In 1203, King John held a perſonal conference with William the Lion, King of Scotland, at this caſtle, touching the demand made by the Scotch King of the northern counties; but nothing was determined, and King John returned in great diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>In the year 1209, King John came with a great army to Norham; the King of Scotland then aſſembling his troops at Roxburgh, a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful war ſeemed to be threatened, from King John's extravagant demands and vehement wrath againſt the Scotch; but by the intervention of the Nobility, the two Monarchs agreed to hold a conference for ſettling their diſputes, at Newcaſtle; to which place the King of Scotland im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately repaired, attended by his brother David and a large train of Nobles; but being taken ſuddenly ill, a truce was concluded on till his health was reſtored. The diſpute remaining unſettled, each Monarch again prepared for war, but a ſecond interpoſition of the Nobility occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0085300202:33"/>
them to hold another conference at <hi>Norham,</hi> in the ſame year, when a treaty of peace was concluded between William King of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and King John, in which John ſtipulated not to erect any fortreſs at Tweedmouth; William on the other hand depoſiting a large ſum of money as reſtitution for the ravages he had committed on the Engliſh borders.</p>
               <p>In the year 1211, the two Kings held another conference at <hi>the caſtle of Norham,</hi> at which Ermengard Queen of Scotland was preſent, and by her amiable conduct greatly promoted the treaty on which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns had met. Here the terms of the former peace were ratified, and ſeveral new articles agreed to.</p>
               <p>In the year 1213, King John, in the utmoſt terror of an inſurrection of his ſubjects and an invaſion from France, in conſequence of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal interdict which had been pronounced, came again to <hi>Norham,</hi> earneſt to ſecure the amity of Scotland. William the Scotch King then lay dangerouſly ill, and was not able to proceed further than Haddington on his engagement to meet the King of England. Highly chagrined at this diſappointment, he returned ſouthward, and it was not long before his ſentence of depoſition was pronounced, his kingdom given to the king of France, and a croiſade publiſhed againſt his territories by the Emiſſaries of the See of Rome. Driven to dreadful dilemma's, John was at length obliged to make his peace with the Holy See; the interdict, which had continued ſix years, was revoked, and the lands of thoſe who had adhered to the papal authority againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and had been pronounced forfeitures to the Crown, of which thoſe of Euſtace de Veſey were part, were reſtored. Soon after this event ſucceeded that glorious combination of the Barons, under which <hi>the great charter</hi> and <hi>charter of the foreſts</hi> were obtained from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant hands of this miſerable tyrant. <hi>To thoſe patriots, whoſe names ought to be engraven on the hearts of every Briton, we owe every thing valuable upon earth, the liberty we poſſeſs, and our authentic right to the properties we enjoy.</hi> To men of the North, the memory of <hi>Euſtace de Veſey, Richard de Percy, Robert de Ros, Peter de Bruis, Nicholas D'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touteſille, William de Moubrai,</hi> and <hi>Oliver de Vaux,</hi> northern Barons in this combination, ſhould be immortal.</p>
               <p>By Hemingford, and under his authority by Knighton, it is alledged, that the violations and injuries the Barons had ſuſtained, as well touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0085300202:34"/>
their liberties and properties as in their private and family con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, urged them to appear more readily in the promotion of this great work, the neceſſity for which had indeed long been experienced. The baſe tyrant was not content with public oppreſſions, but in his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of vice, even deſcended to the violation of the wives and daughters of his Barons; to which purpoſe he practiſed the vileſt artifices. He had by ſtratagem poſſeſſed himſelf of the ſignet of <hi>Euſtace de Veſey,</hi> by means of which he attempted to delude his Lady, that he might vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her chaſtity. Veſey by a happy diſcovery gained a knowledge of the King's intentions, and concerting meaſures with the Lady, had addreſs enough to put a common proſtitute into the arms of the tyrant, and preſerve the honour of his family. Exulting in the ſucceſs of his project, and amidſt the fervour of a generous reſentment, he reproached the King to his face with his baſeneſs, reviled him for the poſſeſſion of a ſtrumpet, and defied his wrath.</p>
               <p>But to return to the hiſtory of Norham.—William King of Scotland dying, was ſucceeded by his ſon Alexander II. a youth not more than 15 years of age. The Barons of Northumberland had recourſe to him for protection, and thereupon paid their homage at <hi>Felton.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed King John ſo much, that he prepared for a northern expedition. In the Year 1215, King Alexander came before <hi>Norham</hi> with a mighty army, and after an inveſtiture for 40 days, was obliged to raiſe the ſiege. This circumſtance is thus mentioned in Leland's Collectanea, v. 1. p. 535. <q>Alexander King of Scottes, ſun to King William, did entre ynto England, and did much deſpite to King John; he aſſegid the caſtel of Mitteford and <hi>Norham,</hi> and toke homages.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1258, King Henry III. had projected a ſcheme for ſurprizing Alexander III. King of Scotland, and reſcuing him from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who had taken him from thoſe miniſters approved of by King Henry. The government of the caſtles of <hi>Norham</hi> and <hi>Wark</hi> was conferred on Robert de Neville, Lord of Raby, whoſe commiſſion from King Henry was <q>to provide himſelf with horſe and arms, to march with the forces deſigned to reſcue Alexander from the reſtraint in which his rebellious ſubjects held him</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Dugdale's Peerage, vol. 1.</note> But this project was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered abortive by the aſſembling of a great army of Scots in the foreſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0085300202:35"/>
of Jedburgh, and a treaty enſued. This <hi>Robert de Neville</hi> was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Lord of Raby, of the name of Neville, being the grandſon of Robert Fitz Maldred, Lord of Raby, who was the lineal male heir of Uchtred Earl of Northumberland.</p>
               <p>A convention was appointed to be held at <hi>Norham,</hi> on the 10th day of May 1290, previous to King Edward the Firſt's entering upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the claims made by the ſeveral competitors for ſucceſſion to the Crown of Scotland, on the death of Margaret of Norway, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant heireſs. The aſſembly that day is ſaid to be held in the pariſh church of Norham, when were preſent the King, and many Nobles and Prelates of both nations. The King declared, that the purpoſe of his coming was in quality of Superior and direct Lord of Scotland, to maintain the tranquillity of that kingdom, and to do impartial juſtice to thoſe who laid claim to the Crown, but previous thereto he demanded their recognition of ſuch his pretended ſovereignty; and it is alledged, that his claim was hiſtorically deduced with great ſkill and artifice by <hi>Anthony Beck,</hi> then Biſhop of Durham: after which three weeks were given for the Scotch Nobles to deliberate on the demand. On the 2d day of June then next, eight competitors, with ſeveral of the Prelates, Nobles, and Community of Scotland appeared, and held their council on this important matter, <q>Congregatis ex oppoſito caſtri de Norham, ex alia parte fluminis Tweedae in quadam arda viridi,</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rot Turri.</note> when all the competitors made the required recognition, and abſolute ſubmiſſion of their ſeveral claims and pretended right to the Scottiſh Crown, to his deciſion.</p>
               <p>On the ſame day the competitors, together with the whole company, came to the King in the church of <hi>Norham,</hi> and ſeveral ſubſequent meetings were held there for ſettling preliminaries: and the ſecond day of the ſucceeding Auguſt was appointed for hearing all claimants at Berwick.</p>
               <p>After judgment was given at Berwick in favour of John Baliol, on the 20th of November 1292, he ſwore fealty to King Edward in the caſtle of <hi>Norham,</hi> in the preſence of many Nobles of both nations; and a commiſſion was thence iſſued for enthroning him at Scone.</p>

                        <q>It were a wonderful proceſſe to declare what miſchefes cam by hungre and aſſeges by the ſpace of XI yeres in Northumberland; for the Scottes became ſo proude after they got Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, that they nothing eſteemed the Engliſhmen.</q>

ſhort ſtate of their progreſs and proceedings in the Mers and Tiviot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale. The progreſs of the Berwick garriſon was as far as Dunglaſs: the garriſons of Wark and Cornhill proceeded as far as the hills of Lammar Muir, and over the dry March of Tiviotdale. The chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were Sir George Bowes, Sir Brian Laiton, and Sir Ralph Eure. On the 17th of July, Bowes, Laiton, and others burnt Dunſe, the chief town of the Mers; and John Carr's ſon, with the garriſon of Cornhill Caſtle, entered Greenlaw, and carried off a booty of cattle, ſheep, and horſes. On the 19th of the ſame month, the men of Tyndale and Ridſdale, returning from a road into Tiviotdale, fought with the Laird of Ferniherſt and his followers, and took him and his ſon John priſoners. On the 24th of July, the garriſon of Wark, the Captain of Norham, and Henry Eure burnt Long Edmin, made many priſoners, and took a baſtell-houſe ſtrongly kept, and got a booty of 40 nolt and 30 horſes, beſides thoſe on which their priſoners were mounted, each on a horſe. On the 2d of Auguſt, the Captain of Norham burnt the town of Home, near to the caſtle gates, with the ſurrounding ſteads. Sept. 6th, Sir Ralph Eure burnt Eikford church and town, the barnekin of Ormeſton, and won by aſſault the Moſs Tower, burnt it, and ſlew 34 people within it: he likewiſe burnt ſeveral other places in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and carried off more than 500 nolt and 600 ſheep, with 100
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0085300202:40"/>
horſe load of ſpoils got in the tower. Sept. 27th, the men of the eaſt and part of the middle March, won the church of Eccles by aſſault, and ſlew 80 men in the abbey and town, moſt part gentlemen of head ſirnames; they alſo took 30 priſoners, and burnt the abbey and town. On the ſame day the garriſon of Berwick brought out of the eaſt end of the Mers 600 bolls of corn, and took priſoner Patrick Home, brother's ſon to the Laird of Aiton. November 5th, the men of the middle March burnt Luſſedden, in which were 16 ſtrong baſtell houſes, ſlew ſeveral of the owners, and burnt much corn. November 9th, Sir George Bowes and Sir Brian Laiton burnt Dryburgh, a market town, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the church, with much corn, and brought away 100 nolt, 60 nags, 100 ſheep, and much other booty, ſpoilage, and inſight gear.</p>
               <p>The whole number of towns, towers, ſteads, barnekins, pariſh churches, and baſtell houſes ſeized, deſtroyed, and burnt, in all the border country, was 192, Scots ſlain 400, priſoners taken 816, nolt 10,386, ſheep 12,492, nags and geldings 1296, gayts 200, bolls of corn 850, inſight gear an indefinite quantity.</p>
               <p>In Hertford's expedition, places burnt, raſed, and caſt down 129; among theſe Dunſe, the abbey and town of Eccles, the tower and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nekin of Niſbit, the towers of Dunſe, Redbraes, Pollard, and Merting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with the caſtles of Wedderburn and Blackadder were raſed. On the river Tweed, from Kelſo upwards, 33 places were deſtroyed; among which were the abbey of Kelſo, the abbey and town of Dryburgh, the abbey of Mailroſs, and the towers of Dawcove and Stotherick: on the river Tiviot 36; among which were the friars near Kelſo, the towers of Roxburgh and Ormeſton, and the two towers of Boon Jedburgh: 12 places on the Rowle Water: 13 on Jed; among which, the abbey, friars, and town of Jedburgh: 45 places on the Kayle, and between it and the Tweed: 19 on Bowbent (alias Bowmont). The ſum total of the places deſtroyed or laid waſte in the whole inroad was 287; of which, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries and friar houſes 7, caſtle towers and piles 16, market towns 5, villages 243, mills 13, ſpitals and hoſpitals 3.</p>
               <p>In the 22d year of the reign of King Henry VIII. <hi>Norham</hi> was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the Scotch, and ſoon after recovered by one Franklin, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Durham.</p>
               <p>In the year 1551, a treaty was ſigned in the church of Norham: the Scotch Commiſſioners were Robert Biſhop of Orkney, Robert Lord Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0085300202:41"/>
Thomas Maſter of Erſkine, and Louis de St. Gelais, Lord of Lanſac, Knt. thoſe for England were Thomas Biſhop of Norwich, Robert Bowes, Leonard Beckwith, and Thomas Chaloner, Knt.</p>
               <p>In 1552, <hi>the caſtle of Norham,</hi> which from the time of Biſhop Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert had appertained to the See of Durham, appears from Lord Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's propoſals for the better protection of the Marches, to be veſted in the Crown. The deprivation of Cuthbert Tunſtal happened on the 11th of October in this year, ſoon after the acceſſion of Queen Mary, before which time we have no public record to ſhew how Norham might come into the power of the Crown. The infamous law for the diſſolution of the biſhopric, is the firſt act of any notoriety I have been able to diſcover which could effect the matter: and notwithſtanding that law, it appears from ſeveral records that in the reign of Queen Mary the caſtle was repaired and again fortified by Biſhop Tunſtal; and that ſome very ſhort time before his death, in the year 1559, he held a treaty there with the Scotch, when were preſent, Thomas Earl of Northumberland, William Lord Dacres of Gilſland, and Croft, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the fortreſs of Berwick, on the behalf of the Engliſh; and for Scotland, the Earls of Morton and Hume, with the Dean of Glaſgow.</p>
               <p>Camden deſcribes <hi>Norham Caſtle</hi> in his time <q>to be ſituate on the top of a high ſteep rock, and fortified with a trench: the outward wall, of great circuit, was guarded by ſeveral turrets in a canton towards the river, in which another wall much ſtronger encircled the keep or tower of great height.</q> This deſcription gives a perfect idea of its figure, after the repairs made by Biſhop Tunſtal. Towards the river the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice, part of which, by the waſhing of the torrent, has given way, and carried with it the ſuperſtructure on that ſide; which with the decay incident to the length of time, has occaſioned a wide breach in the outward wall ſpoken of by Camden: the turrets, as he is pleaſed to ſtile them, appear to be no other than demi-baſtions, a mode of fortification peculiar to the age in which this erection aroſe; a perfect model of which, ſtill in good preſervation, appears at <hi>Hartlepool,</hi> in the county of Durham, of near the ſame date, being the palatinate port of the biſhopric.</p>
               <p>The wall of the caſtle of Norham, which extended from the water on the ſouth ſide, was guarded with a gate-way and tower, having ſquare turrets on each ſide, and thence aſcending the ſteeps ſtretching
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0085300202:42"/>
eaſtward, was alſo defended by another gate-way of ſuperior dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, fortified by two heavy round flanking towers, the remains of which are ſtill conſiderable. This appears to be the chief entrance, and fronts a plain of conſiderable extent: it was defended by a draw bridge over a very wide moat, which began here, and was extended round the land ſide of the caſtle, encloſing a ſpacious area or ballium, with a very ſtrong wall garniſhed with demi-baſtions at intervals. Within the area of this outward wall are the remains of a chapel and ſeveral other ſtructures. To defend the keep or main tower, a very ſtrong wall encloſes a narrow area or interior ballium, which is entered by a gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, guarded on each hand by ſquare towers. The keep is a very large heavy ſquare building, vaulted underneath, like moſt ſtructures of this kind. Part of the vaults and ſome of the priſons remain entire, but all the interior parts of the tower above, are laid open and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. The remains of an exploratory turret are ſeen on one corner of the keep: it may be preſumed it was originally uniform, bearing a turret at each corner. The height of the great tower is about 70 feet, containing four ſtories or ranges of apartments. The whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is conſtructed of red free-ſtone, of a ſoft nature, and ſubject to decay. There is not the leaſt ornament about it, and the whole aſpect is gloomy to the greateſt degree: it wears the countenance of the times of King Stephen, without any embelliſhments of the age in which Biſhop Tunſtal lived.</p>
               <p>This has been a very formidable fortreſs, inacceſſible from the Tweed; and before the uſe of fire arms, from its preſent remains ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears impregnable, if fully garriſoned, and duly provided with ſtores againſt a ſiege. When the outward walls were in repair, and filled with troops; when the oillets and other devices for the garriſon's fighting and defence were properly ſupplied with experienced archers, and the baſtions were kept by men of valour, it ſeems almoſt incredible that this place could ever be taken by aſſault. But when there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular blockade, and time for mining and raiſing engines, the defence then conſiſting of different manoeuvres, would conſequently harraſs the moſt powerful garriſon; frequent ſallies becoming neceſſary, by which the troops are expoſed to the ſuperior numbers of beſiegers: inceſſant watchings and ſevere duties wear down the greateſt fortitude of ſoul, and ſcarcity of proviſion with perpetual anxiety ſubdue the moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heart. Such are the calamities of a ſiege, and ſuch were many times experienced here: but of all the diſtreſſes the valiant know, none

equals that which proceeds from a defection in his partizans, and the corruption of his colleagues. So prone is the human heart to evil, that we find in the hiſtory of every ſtate and people, ſuch horrid tales of treachery, that the ſtain upon the human character leaves ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a ſentiment upon the mind of the reader, as with its bitterneſs and gall almoſt overwhelms the pleaſures we receive by the images of virtue.

                  <hi>The old caſtle,</hi> of which little remains but ſcattered fragments, and confuſed heaps of foundations, ſtood to the north-weſt of the preſent town: much of its ſtrength ſeems to have conſiſted in the elevation and mount on which it was erected.

               <p>Monſieur Jorvin wrote a deſcription of England and Scotland, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at Paris, A. D. 1672, which the editor of the Antiquarian Reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory thought worth inſerting in that work: the account given of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and the adjoining country, contains ſeveral particulars which claim a place here.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Barrwick is the firſt town by which I re-entered England, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a frontier to England, has been fortified in different manners: there is in it at preſent a large garriſon, as in a place of importance to this kingdom. It is bounded by the river Tweed, which empties itſelf into the ſea, and has a great reflux, capable of bringing up large veſſels, was it not prevented by ſands at the entrance into its port. I arrived here about ten of the clock on a Sunday; the gates
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0085300202:45"/>
were then ſhut during church time, but were opened at eleven, as is the cuſtom in all fortified places. <hi>Here is an upper and a lower town,</hi> which are both on the ſide of a hill, that ſlopes towards the river. <hi>On its top there is a ruined and abandoned caſtle, although its ſituation makes it appear impregnable: it is environed on one ſide by the ditch of the town, on the other ſide by one of the ſame breadth, flanked by many round towers and thick walls, which encloſe a large palace, in the middle of which riſes a lofty keep or donjon, capable of a long reſiſtance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all the environs of the town.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The high town encloſes within its walls and ditches thoſe of the lower, from which it is only ſeparated by a ditch filled with water. In the upper town the ſtreets are ſtraight and handſome, but there are not many rich inhabitants, they rather preferring the lower town, in which there are <hi>many great palaces,</hi> ſimilar to that which has been built near the great church, and <hi>in all the open areas are great fountains,</hi> and in one of them, the guard houſe and public parade, before the town hall or ſeſſions houſe, over which is the clock tower of the town; ſo that by walking over Barwick, I diſcovered it to be <hi>one of the greateſt and moſt beautiful towns in England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The greateſt part of the ſtreets in the lower town, are either up or down hill, but they are filled with many rich Merchants, on account of the convenience and vicinity of its port, bordered by a large quay, along which the ſhips are ranged. There is not a ſtone bridge in all England, longer or better built than that of Barwick, which has 16 large and wonderfully well wrought arches; <hi>it is conſidered as one of the moſt remarkable curioſities of the kingdom.</hi> I paſſed over it in leaving the place, adjoining to it is a large ſuburb, <hi>from whence the country is covered with heath and briars to Aſhton,</hi> where there is a caſtle; Bowk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, where the ſea appears on the left, and a ſmall iſland not far off, which forms a pretty good harbour, near a village, having a caſtle. All this ſea coaſt is covered with ſand banks, <hi>and the interior country to Belford an entire deſert, as it is far above</hi> 20 <hi>miles round about;</hi> being only fitted for feeding cattle, occaſioned by divers rivulets, which run through meadow, where great herds of all ſorts of cattle may be ſeen feeding.</q>

                  <hi>The town of Berwick</hi> lays on the inclination of an eaſy ſlope, towards the river; moſt of the buildings are ancient, and make but a mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0085300202:46"/>
the ſtreets are narrow, except that only in which the town houſe is placed. The fortifications are modern, and ſaid to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, being conſtructed agreeable to the modes adopted ſince the uſe of cannon. In the year 1560, theſe new works were begun, by which the ancient fortification was greatly reduced; for this purpoſe many houſes were taken down, and a tower which ſtood in a ſtreet called <hi>Hide hill:</hi> the ancient chief fortreſs or caſtle, which adjoined to the ſouth-weſt corner of the old town wall, was left at the diſtance of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred yards from the modern works. Camden ſpeaking of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, ſays it is "Munitiſſimum totius Brittaniae oppidum." The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fortifying with baſtions was a French device, begun in the time of Francis I. and Charles V. or at the ſooneſt of Louis XII.—The Lord Grey of Wilton was the firſt that bore the title of Governor of Berwick in commiſſion. There are excellent barracks for the garriſon, the building plain and neat, conſiſting of a center and two wings. The public walk is on the rampier, where the gaity of the inhabitants is chiefly diſplayed, and to which the ſoldiery contribute greatly.

                     <p n="1">I.

                                 <p>Burrough and its contraction <hi>Burgh</hi> (of which alſo I take <hi>Burrow, Barrow,</hi> and <hi>Bury</hi> to be ſo many corruptions) is an allowed note of the antiquity of the place ſo called, as well by <hi>Cambden</hi> himſelf as thoſe who are the authors of the annotations upon him; nor can there be a more effectual confirmation of that note, than that thoſe <hi>old</hi> and <hi>mother towns</hi> that have the privilege of ſending members to parliament, are particularly diſtinguiſhed by that name, and are called <hi>Burroughs,</hi> or allowed to be ſo; the whole title of many of them to their preſent enjoyment of that right in the ſtate of decay they are now reduced to, ſeems to reſt in their claim to that title, and in the reſpect and veneration which the evidences of antiquity inſerted in that name beſpeaks for them.</p>
                                 <p>I cannot perceive that the name <hi>Burrough</hi> or <hi>Burgh,</hi> was inſtituted to denote any kind of eminence in the place ſo called, beyond others, ſo as to mean a <hi>Fort</hi> or <hi>Caſtle,</hi> or place any way fortified with ramparts, or otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed by any peculiar advantages, as is often ſuggeſted by <hi>Camden;</hi> or that the name puts the place called by it under any diſtinction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unleſs accidentally, beſides that of common habitation, the bare antiquity of which it only implys, becauſe it is often confounded with ſuch appellatives to aſcertain and diſtinguiſh it, as <hi>Burgh Caſtle, Burgh Fort,</hi> &amp;c. and that it ſignifies no more than <hi>houſe, houſes, or a town,</hi> a ſettlement where one or more families dwelt. <hi>Burrough</hi> was the <hi>habitation,</hi> and <hi>Bour</hi> was the <hi>inhabitant,</hi> hence <hi>neighbour</hi> i. e. a <hi>nigh-bour</hi> or one that lived in a <hi>Burrough</hi> not far off.</p>
                                 <p>But the name <hi>Burrough,</hi> though at firſt it directly meant only one common habitation, yet carries in it monumental evidences of the original form of ſuch habitation, and indirectly lets us into that: for our application of the name <hi>Burrough,</hi> to the habitation of ſuch animals whoſe natures are incapable of making improvements in their manner of dwelling that is ſtill retained among us, diſcovers the native and ſimple ſignification of the name <hi>Burrough,</hi> when our anceſtors gave their own dwellings that name; for we appropriate it only to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground lodgings of animals, as to the holes of <hi>foxes, badgers,</hi> and <hi>rabbits.</hi> From whence I infer that when it was firſt applied to human habitation, whether in an alluſive ſenſe from them, or their's from it; or whether both were ſimple and equally original, that it ſignified the very ſame, or what nearly reſembled the habitations of thoſe creatures, and conſequently that the inhabitants of this land, when the name was given, dwelt chiefly underground, and lived not in houſes raiſed from the ground, but in holes dug in it, which ſenſe of the word ſeems ſtill to obtain as to the dead, though it has loſt its native idea as to the living; for hence we may call putting a corpſe into a hole underground to <hi>bury</hi> or <hi>burrough it:</hi> a <hi>barrow</hi> or <hi>burrough</hi> being a place dug for that purpoſe, though the cuſtom of monumental tumulation has abuſed the word to expreſs the contrary to what it was inſtituted to expreſs, and to ſignify a <hi>hill</hi> inſtead of a <hi>hole.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Our original <hi>Burroughs</hi> in the primitive ſimplicity were but as ſo many human warrens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a ſet of underground caverns; the lodging part and body at leaſt of each dwelling run in, and was underground; and this is but ſuitable to the ſavage way of life of the old
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0085300202:52"/>Britons in other reſpects; ſuch as their going naked, which alone cuts off all the ends almoſt of raiſing houſes: for to what end ſhould men raiſe houſes, who had neither cloaths nor fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, nor wanted any guard againſt the inclemency of the air, nor had any intent of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement to anſwer, but ſecurity from wild beaſts, or noiſe whilſt they ſlept? Their painted or rather ſmoke-bound hides, looked as if they lived in rooms where ſmoke had no vent by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows or chimneys; to which we may add, as an inducement to natural ſimplicity, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground lodgings were both cooler in ſummer (if our clime is ever too hot) and warmer in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for which latter reaſon 'tis pretty near kept to in <hi>Iceland, Lapland,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Purchas</hi> ſays of the <hi>Icelanders,</hi> all their houſes are under ground.

Digging downward for habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both before and long after the flood, appears to have been the common and general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and Nature's firſt genuine method, which men departed from either through diſtruſt or ignorance of God's providence, leſt there ſhould be a ſecond deluge; or as the fear of wild
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0085300202:53"/>beaſts, or of each other grown wild or ſavage, prevailed over Nature's preſent or more ſimple recourſe for habitation; or as the local inconveniences of the foundering in the natural mould might put them here and there upon artificial walls and roofs; or as ſuffocating damps or ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous ſteams and exhalations made them continue building upwards as an expedient; or as the nearneſs of the ſprings would not permit them to ſink houſes, but forced them to above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground habitations: this not being a thing of choice but neceſſity, a violence offered to natural dictate and diſpoſition, men went no further nor faſter into them than juſt in the ſimpleſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to avoid inconvenience that put them upon it, ſo as to live above ground with as much reſemblance ſtill as poſſible to living under ground; either raiſing an artificial bank, and then ſcooping out the earth from the ſide, for even mud walls were not preſently invented, till ſome ſuperior and happy genius diſcovered the tempering of the artificial paſte, and the uſe of it now ſo vulgar and univerſal, which was once the ſecret and rarity of the age: however now the prejudices from the reverſe of cuſtom, and the modern refinements of artificial dwellings has turned the ideas and very thoughts of ſubterraneous living within walls, and under roofs of earth, of Nature's diſpoſing, into contempt and ridicule, and we laugh at the ſimplicity and extream awkwardneſs of the thing, yet we continue to pay regard to the name, and while we ſpurn the ſubſtance, load the ſhadow with dignity and pre-eminence, and make it a title of preference to all that culture and elegance of modern architecture that has ſucceeded it.—All the firſt ſettled habitations were <hi>caves,</hi> nor is it likely there were houſes, unleſs ſtationary places of defence before, or for ſome generations after the <hi>flood.</hi> Had architecture been preſently from the creation invented, or been natural, yet it is not likely there were any materials in the firſt ages to build withall, for they would require conſiderable time for their generation, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing few ſtones, and ſtill fewer quarries to be ſuppoſed perfectly formed, the rocks requiring ages to bring them to a firmneſs beyond paſte; nor were the mines of metals haſtily ripened to a hardneſs for tools: nor are we ſure that woods or timber trees were created mature, or enew to be employed in building, till they had by God's command propagated their ſeveral kinds. <hi>Brick,</hi> therefore, or naked earth, was of neceſſity, probably, not choice, the firſt material of architecture, and the only one, which nevertheleſs muſt have been unſerviceable, had not the natural ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                 <p>After under-ground living was generally quitted, as to natural and civil life, yet we find how <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> ſtill loved to keep it on, by under-ground <hi>cells, chapels, and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories:</hi> nor is it to the diſadvantage of <hi>burrough life,</hi> that ſo many of thoſe, of whom the world was not worthy, are ſaid to have dwelt in <hi>dens and caves</hi> of the earth, ſome of choice, and others for refuge. <hi>Grotius</hi> notes on <hi>Lot's</hi> dwelling in a <hi>cave,</hi> (Geneſis xix. 30.) that <hi>Strabo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates there were abundance of <hi>caves</hi> in that country, which being one of thoſe that were firſt inhabited, ſtrengthens the thought that they came not there by chance, but were made by the men for habitation, though by change of cuſtom difuſed; and the abundance of them in all countries that admit of it, confirms the ſame truth, as to their ſeveral aborigines.</p>
                                 <p>That there are fewer <hi>burroughs</hi> in our lower and flat countries, and part of the nation, tho' otherwiſe more populous, and better ſtocked with modern towns, than the hilly parts, may alſo proceed from their being leſs commodious for the <hi>burrough life</hi> then in vogue; which may be one reaſon why <hi>Cornwall</hi> has in it more <hi>burroughs,</hi> in proportion, than any other county, and where the aboriginal inclination to <hi>burrough life</hi> very remarkably alſo exemplified itſelf among the inhabitants, as many of which almoſt are ſaid to live in <hi>burroughs</hi> in the old ſenſe of the word, as in thoſe above ground.</p>
                                 <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> indeed repreſent the <hi>Britons,</hi> when they found them, as living in <hi>huts of reeds or wood,</hi> and their <hi>towns</hi> as ſo many <hi>woods;</hi> but the <hi>Britons,</hi> who knew themſelves beſt, cannot be ſuppoſed, without reaſon and propriety, to have given a name to their habitations, that ſpeaks them to have been of another nature; againſt which no foreign teſtimony can ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, as to make us think otherwiſe, but that in ſome period of time or other, either then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or ſince, the inhabitants notions of dwelling were agreeable to what that name expreſſed, and that conſiderable diſpoſitions were made actually among themſelves accordingly.</p>
                                 <p>The name <hi>burrough</hi> appears to have travelled hither from <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> whence we were firſt peopled, and where a great many of their oldeſt and moſt conſiderable towns carry <hi>burgh</hi> and <hi>burrough</hi> in their name; and the thing itſelf, in the colder climates, as I have hinted, is pretty near kept up to.

There the King conferred the honour of Knighthood on <hi>Henry Percy</hi> and others, as was uſual in thoſe

times, on the like occaſions. The navy perceiving the diſplay of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the mouth of the Tweed, where the fleet then lay, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the attack was beginning, anxious to win part of the laurels of the day, puſhed over the bar, and gained the haven; by which three ſhips were loſt, having ſtranded, where they were burnt by the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: the reſt were ſcarce able to eſcape in the ebb tide. King Edward deſirous to ſave his fleet, ordered an immediate attack, whilſt the chief part of the garriſon was employed in defending the town neareſt the haven. He is charged by Fordun and other Scottiſh writers with uſing a deluſive artifice, in detaching a body of men, under the cover of ſome riſing grounds, to gain an approach on another quarter, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing Scotch colours, induce the garriſon to permit their advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the fortifications, under a preſumption that they were a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement for the town. The Engliſh authors take no notice of this ſtratagem. It appears from the beſt authorities, that the fortifications of this place, at that time, conſiſted chiefly of a ditch, and a rampier of earth with a barricado of timber: through theſe the Engliſh army made their entrance with very little difficulty, and the garriſon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, aſtoniſhed at the ſuddenneſs of the event, and overwhelmed by ſuperior force, were ſlaughtered without much reſiſtance. The chief oppoſition that was made, was by 30 Flandrian Merchants, who held out a ſtrong tower, called the <hi>Red Hall,</hi> till the evening, when fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet to it, the building was conſumed, and all within periſhed. In the reduction of this tower, the brother of the <hi>Earl of Cornwall,</hi> a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knight, was ſlain by a ſpear's piercing his eye, as he looked up to thoſe who fought above. All the gentlemen and fighting men of Fife are ſaid to have been put to the ſword. The <hi>caſtle,</hi> commanded by <hi>William Douglas,</hi> ſurrendered the ſame day, and its garriſon, conſiſting of 200 men, were permitted to march out armed, on ſwearing from thenceforth not to fight againſt the King or kingdom of England; but their Governor was detained a priſoner. Fordun ſays the number of ſlain was 7500; that the ſtreets ran with blood two days, and in ſuch quantities as to make mills go. Boetheus ſays alſo the ſlain were about 7000 in number, and ſays that mills were actually ſet a-going with the blood. Matthew Weſtminſter ſays, that all were ſlain, without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſex or age, in number 60,000. In the inſtructions from the Regency and Council of Scotland, to their Procurators at Rome, A. D. 1301, it is ſaid, that after taking <hi>Berwick,</hi> the King and his army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the moſt barbarous cruelties on the inhabitants, who to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of almoſt 8000 were ſlain, without diſtinction of character, ſex, or

                  <hi>Sterling Caſtle</hi> had ſuſtained a long ſiege and blockade, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor was at length obliged to accede to certain articles, under which, if this fortreſs was not relieved before an appointed day, it was to be ſurrendered to <hi>Bruce:</hi> King Edward determined to march to its relief, and with all poſſible expedition moved his army from Berwick. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> informed of the intention of the Engliſh Monarch, reſolved to abide the event of a battle, rather than raiſe the ſiege. He had viewed the ground, and fixed upon a part near the caſtle, where he ſhould have only juſt ſufficient room to marſhal his troops with advantage, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their arms. This place was defended on the one hand by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible rocks, and on the other by a moraſs, having the water of Bannokburn in front. King Edward being informed the country near Sterling was full of moraſſes, and difficult to be paſſed, ſo that his horſe could not be of the ſervice he wiſhed, he levied a reinforcement of foot, 4000 from Yorkſhire, 2500 from Northumberland, 1500 from Durham, and 2000 from Derby and Nottingham. In the advance the army was divided into ten columns, 10,000 men in each, commanded by leaders of the moſt diſtinguiſhed character; the <hi>Earls of Glouceſter and Hereford</hi> led the van, the center was led by the <hi>King</hi> in perſon, <hi>Sir Giles D'Argentein</hi> and <hi>Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke,</hi> Generals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. The army under theſe diviſions, is ſaid to have covered a large tract of country, and was a ſight auguſt and ſolemn; the whole ſcene made reſplendent, by burniſhed arms and diſplayed enſigns.</p>
               <p>As the Engliſh approached, <hi>Bruce</hi> led his troops to occupy the choſen ground, on the Saturday before the battle. To ſtrengthen the ſtation, he cauſed pits to be dug in front, armed with pointed ſtakes within, covered with hurdles or flakes, and concealed by turfs and ruſhes. On the morning of Sunday, being Midſummer Eve, <hi>Bruce</hi> with his Lords and Chieftains attended ſolemn devotions and maſs in the front of the army; and the Prieſts went through the ranks, exhorting each ſoldier <q>to exert his powers for the relief of his country, and rather die a martyr in the virtuous cauſe, than ſee the Engliſh again become ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical taſk-maſters, as they had been in the time of King Edward I.

The Engliſh were ordered to advance ſo near <hi>Bruce</hi>'s ſtation; on Sunday evening, that though harraſſed with a tedious march, they were obliged to lay under arms all night, for fear of a ſurprize. This evening was not without ſeveral ſkirmiſhes and re-encounters, in which the Engliſh were worſted: in one of theſe <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> engaged and ſlew <hi>Sir Henry Boynton;</hi> cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head with a battle ax.

               <p>The diſpoſition of the Scotch army on the day of battle was in four diviſions: <hi>Sir Thomas Randolph</hi> commanded the van, <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> the right wing, and <hi>Sir James Douglas</hi> the left; <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> was with the body of reſerve or rear. The Scotch were all on foot, that by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the danger and diſtreſs of the engagement equal, the ardour of each might by example be exhilerated. The ſoldiers of the body of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, were covered with light coats of mail, which a ſword could not penetrate: they carried an ax in the belt, and lances in their hands. Malmſbury deſcribes the Scotch army moving, "as thick as a hedge." The leaders were men of that ſkill and valour, that they poſſeſſed the confidence of the troops. In the Engliſh army, the foot, conſiſting of ſpearmen and archers, were in the van, the horſe were on each flank; and in theſe poſitions the armies engaged.</p>
               <p>The onſet was vigorous and well maintained on both ſides. The <hi>Earl of Glouceſter</hi> commanded that part of the line which was attacked by <hi>Sir James Douglas's</hi> corps, conſiſting of 7000 Borderers and 3000 Iriſh Scots or Katerans, vulgarly called Redſhanks, a fierce and valiant race. The Engliſh, unable to ſuſtain the ſhock, began to give way, when the Earl, impatient of diſgrace and inflamed with ire, accompanied by a choſen band, ruſhed into the thickeſt of the foes, where he was beaten from his horſe and ſlain. The covered pits deterred or fruſtrated his Knights from effecting his reſcue. Malmſbury ſays, with great warmth,

(confundat eos Dominos) they were 500 in number, and in the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency 20 might have effected his relief. <hi>Sir Giles D'Argentein,</hi> a man much eſteemed by <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and of great military fame, one of the Commanders of the <hi>Gens d' Armes</hi> who guarded the King, advanced to <hi>Glouceſter's</hi> relief, but died in the attempt. <hi>Robert de Clifford, Payen de Tiptoft, William Mareſcal, Edmund Mayley,</hi> and ſeveral other eminent leaders were equally unfortunate in thoſe parts of the army where they commanded, and were ſoon numbered with the ſlain. The Engliſh archers, who had ſo often carried victory with them in former conflicts, were attacked in flank, and put to the rout, by a troop of light cavalry cloſe armed, who were remounted for this critical ſervice, and led by <hi>Sir Robert Keith,</hi> Marſhal of Scotland. The confuſion among the archers, and the fall of ſuch eminent leaders, ſtruck the Engliſh army with a panic, which was not a little increaſed by the ſight of a large body of men advancing over the ſummit of a diſtant eminence, who were no other than the attendants on the carriages and baggage, drawn up in martial array, and diſplaying pieces of linen on the ends of ſpears, which at that diſtance appeared like a crowd of banners. Confuſion and uproar ſoon took place, and the Engliſh Monarch was adviſed to ſecure his retreat, as Victory was declaring on every hand for <hi>Bruce,</hi> and the Engliſh forces, wearied and fainting, were giving way. The King with great reluctance and ſhame conſented to move the royal ſtandard, the ſight of which compleated what the valour of the Scotch phalanx had ſo gloriouſly begun: the rout became general, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes fell as well under the ſword in the purſuit, as in the waters of <hi>Bannockburn</hi> and <hi>Forth.</hi> The effuſion of blood was greatly ſpared, by the avarice of plunder, the rich baggage of the Engliſh army affording immenſe booty to the victors. Of the Scots, only two leaders of note fell, <hi>William Vipont</hi> and <hi>Walter Roſs.</hi> Seven hundred Engliſh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were miſſing after the battle, the greateſt part of whom were among the priſoners. <hi>Sterling</hi> ſurrendered to the King of Scotland, who ordered the fortifications to be deſtroyed to their foundations. Redpath, in his Border Hiſtory, ſays, <q>The rout of the Engliſh was indeed very entire; but neither the number they brought to the field, nor the loſs they ſuſtained, appear to have been nigh ſo great as the Scottiſh writers repreſent them.</q>

               <p>King Edward with a body of horſe fled towards <hi>Berwick,</hi> purſued by <hi>Sir James Douglas</hi> with a party of light cavalry, who effected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but taking up a few ſtragglers, who fell off from the King's troop.

               <p>In the year 1315, the Scots attempted to take <hi>Berwick</hi> by ſurprize, by means of their ſhipping, with which they entered the river under falſe colours; but being diſcovered by the garriſon before they began an attack, ſuffered conſiderable loſs e'er they could effect an eſcape.</p>

Many of the garriſon and townſmen retired into the caſtle, from whence they made a ſally, preſuming the Scotch forces were weak, from the thin diſplay of banners; but they were repulſed with ſome loſs. The news of regaining <hi>Berwick</hi> was ſoon ſpread over the adjacent country, and numbers of Scotch crowded thither, to maintain the place and aſſiſt in the ſiege of the caſtle, which ſtood out ſix days,<note n="*" place="bottom">This differs widely from Leland's account.</note> and then capitulated on terms, for the garriſon to march out with their arms, and depart for England. The Scotch King <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> ſoon after arrived, and with his Court reſided ſome time in the caſtle. He made his ſon-in-law, <hi>Walter, Steward of Scotland,</hi> Governor, who, ambitious of poſſeſſing a ſettlement on the borders, where he might diſplay his youthful courage, called out 500 Gentlemen his dependents, with others of inferior rank, ſkilful in ſhooting with bows and working engines, for the more effectual defence of the place. <hi>Sir John Crab,</hi> a Fleming, of high reputation in his art, was made chief Engineer.</p>
               <p>King Edward, in the ſucceeding year, prepared to recover <hi>Berwick,</hi> and on the firſt of September approached with a large body of troops, having with him <hi>Lancaſter, Pembroke, Arundell, Hertford, Warren,</hi> and the <hi>Earl Marſhal</hi> the King's brother, <hi>Hugh D'Eſpencer, Roger de Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mori,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Deudeley,</hi> parceners to the earldom of Glouceſter, by marriage of the coheireſſes, the late Earl's ſiſters. This force was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a fleet from the cinque ports, laden with proviſions and all kind of ſtores. The Engliſh fortified their camp, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to an aſſault. The walls of the town are deſcribed to be ſo low, that an aſſailant might ſtrike the people that defended them, with a ſpear. On the ſeventh of September they attempted an eſcalade, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts in the ſame time, and a ſhip was directed to approach with an engine, to attempt the walls on the ſide next the haven; but all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0085300202:68"/>
theſe were fruitleſs, the ſhip was left on ground by ebb of tide, and burnt by the garriſon. In the next general aſſault, which was made on the 13th of September, the Engliſh employed a great machine called a <hi>Sow,</hi> conſtructed for holding and defending men, who were moved in it towards the foot of the wall, in order to undermine and ſap its foundation. Devices were uſed to burn this machine, but by throwing a ſtone of vaſt weight from an engine, the Sow was ſplit, and her oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiers diſlodged. On an attack of <hi>Marygate,</hi> the draw bridge was burnt, and the gate in great danger; but forces from the caſtle coming to its defence, the aſſailants were obliged to retire. Theſe efforts har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and weakened the garriſon conſiderably, and the town muſt on another aſſault, have fallen into the hands of the Engliſh, if Lancaſter had not withdrawn his forces from the camp, exerciſing his malignant ſpirit at this critical time againſt the King, whom he hated moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terately.

                  <hi>King Robert Bruce</hi> perceiving the importance of this place, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the walls, and raiſed them conſiderably in height, giving alſo many new towers and additional bulwarks to the whole.</p>
               <p>In the year 1323, <hi>King Robert Bruce</hi> at this place ratified the treaty of peace entered into with King Edward III. by his plenipotentiaries at <hi>Biſhop Thorpe</hi> near <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1328, <hi>Joan</hi> the ſiſter of King Edward III. being contracted to <hi>David</hi> the ſon and heir of <hi>King Robert Bruce,</hi> was conveyed to <hi>Berwick</hi> with a ſplendid retinue, where ſhe was received by the <hi>Earl of Murray</hi> and <hi>Lord Douglas,</hi> repreſentatives of the King, he being ſick; and the nuptials were celebrated with great magnificence. She was called <hi>Make Peace,</hi> and carried with her the ragman roll, and all records which had been ſeized by King Edward I. to be again depoſited in the Scotch archives.</p>
               <p>At this ceremony, a magnificent parade was made by the nobles of each nation, and a ſumptuous pageant crowded the place, with all that ſolemn pomp, which in the days of chivalry decked out public ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: Sumptured horſes, and men braced in ſhining arms, forming long

trains of ſteel effigies, ſtiffened in coats of mail, and ſtrapped like inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate beings to the ſaddle, were the chief objects: <hi>Lord Mortimers'</hi> retinue alone, conſiſted of nine ſcore Knights, properly capariſoned, with their Eſquires, Gentlemen, and Yeomen.</p>
               <p>The expedition of <hi>Lord Henry Beaumont</hi> and his aſſociates into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in the year 1332, being attended with remarkable ſucceſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an object of ſerious attention with the Engliſh Monarch; in ſo much that <hi>Edward Baliol,</hi> ſupported by this party in his pretenſions to the Crown of Scotland, as ſucceſſor of his father <hi>John Baliol,</hi> having gained the caſtle of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> King Edward received his letters patent iſſued from thence, in which he acknowledged the King of England ſupreme Lord of Scotland, and ceded to him the <hi>town, caſtle, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Berwick,</hi> to be annexed to his kingdom, with many other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous ceſſions and terms of amity and alliance, of ſuch weight and conſideration, that the King ſummoned his parliament to meet at <hi>York,</hi> to deliberate thereon. As many of the ſtates, eſpecially the Prelates were abſent, nothing was determined: in general, it was thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to treat with the guardian and nobles of <hi>King David</hi>'s party; for which purpoſe commiſſioners were inſtructed to require homage and fealty from the Scotch King, and a ceſſion of <hi>Berwick;</hi> but theſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were rejected with the utmoſt diſdain. <hi>Baliol</hi> during this time had a perilous eſcape from <hi>Annan,</hi> and was obliged to take refuge in England, his party being thrown into the utmoſt confuſion. King Edward was too far advanced in the cauſe to recede, and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the terms propoſed by <hi>Baliol</hi> at <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and ratified them on his part.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Edward Baliol gave up Berwick, Roxburg, Dedinburg, Pebilles, and Dunfres, to King Edward, and promiſid to make hym homage for the reſideu, after that the hole Engliſch Hoſte had faught with the Scottes, and had ſo great a victory of the toune of Berwick, was gyven up to King Edward.</p>

               <p>The Engliſh did not recover <hi>Berwick,</hi> till the 7th year of the reign of King Edward III. after the battle of <hi>Halydoun Hill,</hi> where the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scottiſh forces was terrible, 7 Earls, 900 Knights, 400 Eſquires, and 32,000 common men died in the field; a carnage dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to recount, and from the very idea of which the ſoul recoils with horror.</p>

                  <hi>King Edward the Third,</hi> on being refuſed the homage of <hi>David Bruce,</hi> and reſtitution of <hi>Berwick,</hi> ordered his Herald to proclaim his defiance of the Scotch King. The Engliſh army began to beſiege <hi>Berwick</hi> on the 12th of April, 1333. The Scots knowing the reduction of this place would be one of the firſt and chief enterprizes of their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to the utmoſt of their power put it in a ſtate of defence, to reſiſt the great ſhock they preſumed it would neceſſarily ſuſtain: they filled it with a garriſon of choſen veterans, and made <hi>Sir William Keith</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>town,</hi> and <hi>Patrick Earl of Dunbar</hi> the keeper of the chief fortreſs or citadel. The King ſoon arrived, and remained in perſon before the walls about a month, when perceiving from the ſtrength of the garriſon, and the vigorous defence they made, that it would not be eaſy to reduce the place, he marched part of his army into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, carrying the horrid ravages of war as far as <hi>Scone, Dundee,</hi> and <hi>Dumbarton.</hi> The moſt ſavage cruelties mark thoſe times; the wild American never deviſed more ſhocking barbarities than ſtained theſe borders; each nation was ingenious in torture, in modes of devaſtation, and in the proſecution of revenge. Having glutted their avarice of blood, and being loaded with pillage, they again returned to <hi>Berwick,</hi> which King Edward ſtill found unſubdued. After receiving reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he declared his determination was either to be maſter of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> or effect ſomething of conſequence, by bringing his adverſaries to battle. The ſiege was changed into a ſtrict blockade: the beſieged diſtreſſed by the cutting off ſupplies, made many ſallies, with various fortune; they made a vigorous attack upon the fleet, and moſt of the navy then before <hi>Berwick</hi> was burnt. The garriſon ſtill entertained hopes of relief, and refuſed to capitulate, preſuming this key to the kingdom, was of too great conſequence to the Scotch, at that time to be neglected, and ſuffered to fall into the hands of the enemy. <hi>Lord Douglas</hi> had levied a powerful army, with which he marched to the neighbourhood of <hi>Berwick;</hi> but to the great diſtreſs of the garriſon, who believed their day of deliverance was at hand, inſtead of attacking the Engliſh, <hi>Douglas</hi> croſſed the Tweed, and in ſight of the town, marched along the coaſt towards <hi>the caſtle of Bambrough,</hi> which being eſteemed impregnable, was choſen by the King of England, as a ſecure reſidence for his Queen. The Scotch waſted ſeveral days in blocking up that fortreſs, and ravaging the adjacent parts, hoping that King Edward's ſollicitude for his Queen, would induce him to raiſe the ſiege of <hi>Berwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0085300202:71"/>The device which had been practiſed with effect in the year 1318, did not now take place; King Edward was not to be moved from his determined purpoſe; the garriſon reduced to extremities for want of proviſions, and diſpirited by the apparent neglect of <hi>Douglas,</hi> propoſed a treaty, which King Edward readily attended to, and the capitulation was concluded on the 15th day of July, under the following condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: That the <hi>town</hi> and <hi>caſtle</hi> ſhould be ſurrendered to King Edward on the 20th, if not relieved with 200 men at arms, or by a battle; that in the interval, there ſhould be a ceſſation of arms; that in caſe of a ſurrender, the lives and properties of the garriſon and inhabitants ſhould be protected, with liberty to ſuch as were ſo inclined to leave the place; and that the Governor ſhould have ſafe conduct granted him to the Scotch army, to communicate the articles. <hi>Sir William Keith</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Scotch camp without delay, and there prevailed that an attempt ſhould be made to relieve the place: a meaſure totally diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by ſome of the oldeſt and moſt experienced of the Scotch leaders.</p>
               <p>In this interval, a tranſaction is ſaid to have taken place, which ſullies the luſtre of Edward's military character, and ſtamps an odium on his memory; it ſtands recorded to the following effect, by Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, Boece, and other Scotch authors of great credit.</p>
               <p>Hoſtages were given by the Scots, for performance of their part of the treaty, one of whom was the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Sir Alexander Seeton,</hi> who was Deputy Governor, and took command on <hi>Keith's</hi> reſorting to the camp. King Edward had alſo in his camp <hi>Seeton</hi>'s younger ſon, taken a priſoner at the aſſault made on the navy. The King apprehending that by the approach of the Scotch army, he might probably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the capture of Berwick, an object of ſo great importance, ſoon after the departure of <hi>Keith,</hi> contrary to the faith of Princes, the ſacredneſs of treaties, the common policy of nations, and all private honour, demanded an immediate ſurrender of the place; threatening if <hi>Seeton</hi> refuſed, that he would immediately hang up his two ſons, the hoſtage and the priſoner, before the walls. <hi>Seeton</hi> remonſtrated, but Edward regardleſs of all the charges made againſt him for the violation of public faith, cauſed a gibbet to be erected in full view of the town, to put in execution his infamous threat. <hi>Seeton</hi> ſtruggling between honour and parental feelings, between duty to his country and love
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0085300202:72"/>
for his children, ſuffered all the pangs ariſing from a conflict, in which every ſentiment was on the rack: Nature would have prevailed, and <hi>Seeton</hi>'s children been ſaved by a ſacrifice of his country's honour and his own, had not the mother, with all the virtue and heroiſm of a Roman matron, and the greatneſs of the moſt exalted mind, argued forcibly to ſupport his principle, and ſuſtain his fainting ſoul; and when yet he ſeemed to relax, ſhe withdrew him from the horrid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, that he might retain his rectitude, though his ſons were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable price by which it was maintained. Edward unrelenting, put them to death, and <hi>Seeton</hi> kept the town.</p>
               <p>This tranſaction is denied by the Engliſh Hiſtorians, who affirm that the Scotch army came in fight before the truce was expired; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Edward could have no pretence for demanding a ſurrender.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Smollet, vol. 2. p. 19.</p>
                     <p>Tyrell ſays, on expiration of the truce mentioned by Boece and Buchanan, King Edward ſummoned the town to ſurrender; to which Seeton replied, he could not conſent thereto, as he had aſſurances of ſpeedy relief. The King inſiſted on the terms of the truce, by which the ſurrender was ſtipulated, and the time was now expired. Seeton ſtill refuſed, would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicated and argued; which ſo incenſed the King, that by advice of his Council he executed one of Seeton's ſons. This act is ſaid to have induced the townſmen whoſe ſons were hoſtages, to ſolicit new terms, and additional days for ceſſation of arms, which King Edward granted.</p>
                     <p>It does not appear that Seeton's ſon was an hoſtage; his name is not in any record of that treaty: but preſuming there was a former treaty, which was renewed or prolonged, and of which no record is now in being, this difficulty ceaſes. Fordun expreſly ſays, King Edward cauſed Seeton's ſon Thomas to be executed on a gibbet, in ſight of his parents; but agrees with Tyrell, that it was not done till after the time of the treaty was expired.</p>
                  </note> This argument is futile, and ſeems weak in oppoſition to the uniformity of the Scotch Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of July, <hi>Lord Douglas</hi> led his army over the Tweed, and encamped at a place called <hi>Bothull</hi> or <hi>Bothville:</hi> the Engliſh poſſeſſed <hi>Halydown Hill,</hi> a very conſiderable eminence on the weſt of Berwick, having an eaſy declivity towards the river; the other ſides were ſteeper. The Scotch diſregarding this apparent advantage, determined to engage on the Scotch ſide of the hill, not only to ſecure a retreat, but in caſe of victory, to take advantage of the flow of tide, which would render the Tweed impaſſable to the Engliſh if they ſhould be routed.</p>
               <p>The Scotch army was diſpoſed in four grand diviſions; <hi>John Murray</hi> commanded the firſt, with <hi>Lord Andrew Frazer</hi> and his ſons <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>James;</hi> the ſecond was commanded by <hi>Robert Lord High Steward of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0085300202:73"/>
Scotland,</hi> with the principal men of his kindred and the <hi>Earl of Monteith;</hi> the third by the <hi>Earls of Roſs, Sutherland, and Strathern;</hi> and the fourth by <hi>Lord Archibald Douglas,</hi> Guardian of the kingdom of Scotland, and Commander in Chief, accompanied by the Earls of <hi>Lenox</hi> and <hi>Carrick.</hi> The whole army amounted to 68,000. The number of King Edward's army is not poſitively mentioned by any author. It is ſuppoſed the number of the Scotch was not ſo great as Hiſtorians have aſſerted, and that they were nearly equal to their adverſaries. King Edward alſo diſpoſed his army in four diviſions, each of which was flanked by choice and ſkilful archers.</p>
               <p>When both ſides were ready to engage, the onſet was a while ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, by the appearance of a Scotchman of gigantic ſtature, who had gained the name of <hi>Turnbull,</hi> on account of a gallant exploit, by which King Robert Bruce was ſaved from the attacks of a wild bull, which had unhorſed him, as he was hunting. <hi>Turnbull,</hi> attended by a great maſtiff,<note n="*" place="bottom">Some of the Borderers on the weſtern Marches kept maſtiffs or bull-dogs, which were let looſe on the ravaging parties —Nicholſon and Burn's Hiſt. Weſt.</note> approached the Engliſh army, and gave a challenge for ſingle combat. After a ſhort pauſe, which the ſingularity of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance occaſioned, the challenge was accepted by <hi>Sir Robert Benhale,</hi> a young Norfolk Knight, much inferior in ſtature to the Scotch cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, but of great ſtrength and adroitneſs in military atchievements. The maſtiff immediately flew forward, and was received by the Knight with a ſtroke upon the loins with his ſword, which ſevered his body. The Scotch champion advanced: <hi>Benhale,</hi> with great agility and ſkill, eluded the heavy blows aimed at him, and firſt cut off the left arm of his adverſary, and at laſt ſtruck off his head.<note n="†" place="bottom">Stowe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Scotch army began to aſcend the hill about the hour of veſpers, with great impetuoſity; their leaders, chieftains, and men at arms diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, the more to animate the troops by rendering the danger equal. They were ſoon out of breath, in conſequence of aſcending the ſteep. The Engliſh archers were advantageouſly placed, in different ſtations on the hill, ſo as to pour down ſuch ſhowers of arrows on the cloſe bodies of the Scotch troops, as made a terrible ſlaughter: they were alſo greatly annoyed by the rolling down of large ſtones from the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and were ſoon thrown into confuſion.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Smollet, v. 2. p. 19.</note> The Engliſh comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0085300202:74"/>
inſtantly availing themſelves of the enemy's diſorder, ordered an attack to be made by the ſpearmen and men at arms, by which they were preſſed whilſt breathleſs and diſpirited, ſo that multitudes fell. The Scotch often retreated, and again rallied and bravely returned to the fight, fiercely maintaining the battle till their General was pierced by a ſpear: his fall ſtruck the army with a panic, and a total rout enſued. The carnage was dreadful. The ſervants charged with the care of the horſes fled, and left their maſters to the deſtroying ſword of a victorious enemy, who were not accuſtomed to mercy. Edward, at the head of a choſen brigade of cavalry, and archers on horſeback, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by <hi>Lord D' Arcy</hi> with his Iriſh troops, led on the purſuit, and directed the ſlaughter. The country for the diſtance of five miles, was ſtrewed with carcaſſes of thoſe who were cut down by their purſuers.<note n="*" place="bottom">Barnes, Fordun, Boece, Buchanan, Knighton, &amp;c.</note> Among the perſons of diſtinction in the Scotch army, there fell the <hi>General,</hi> the <hi>Earls of Roſs, Sutherland, Carrick, Athol, Lenox,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teith;</hi> three <hi>Stewards,</hi> uncles of Robert the Lord High Steward, three <hi>Frazers, Sir John Graham, Sir Duncan Campbell,</hi> and <hi>Sir William Tudway.</hi>

               <p>King Edward determining to retain Berwick, appointed <hi>Lord Henry Percy</hi> Governor of the caſtle, and gave a commiſſion to him and the Earl of March, to act as joint Wardens of all the country on this ſide the Scottiſh ſea, where the terms of peace were received. He required 12 hoſtages for Berwick, to be choſen out of the chief inhabitants; eight of whom he placed at Newcaſtle, and four at York.</p>
               <p>Edward Baliol did homage to King Edward at Newcaſtle upon Tyne, in June 1334, his parliament having ratified the treaty of Roxburgh, whereby the caſtle, town, and county of Berwick, with their appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages, were to be annexed to the Crown of England for ever.</p>
               <p>In the year 1339, <hi>Lord John Mowbray</hi> was Governor of Berwick: he had in garriſon 120 men at arms, 100 halberdiers, and 200 archers.</p>
               <p>In 1340, King Edward III. was at Berwick with an army of 40,000 foot and 6000 horſe.</p>
               <p>In 1341, King Edward kept the feſtival of Eaſter here, and held a tournament, in which 12 Knights of Scotland entered the liſts with 12 of the King's train. This ſpectacle was exhibited with great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſolemn pomp; but from the animoſity which ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the people of the two nations, this exhibition was attended with ſo much ire and inveteracy, and ſuch bitter rivalſhip, that two Scotch Knights were ſlain, and Sir John Twiford, an Engliſh Knight.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of November, A. D. 1354, a treaty was held at Berwick for the ranſom of <hi>David Bruce, King of Scotland,</hi> taken priſoner at the battle of <hi>Durham,</hi> on the 26th of October 1346; and on the 3d of

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0085300202:78"/>
London only three days before he ſet forward for Berwick; before which place he came on the 14th day of January with a large army, attended by a great naval power, with which he laid ſiege to the town both by ſea and land. The King entered the caſtle, which ſtill held out for him, and meditated a ſally at the time his troops began the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0085300202:79"/>
aſſault on other quarters: <hi>Sir Walter Manny,</hi> with miners brought from the foreſt of Dean, was employed at the ſame time, in advancing a mine below the wall. Theſe vigorous meaſures induced the garriſon to ſurrender the town. Some of the Scotch Hiſtorians ſay, the garriſon on the approach of King Edward's army evacuated the place, having
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0085300202:80"/>
firſt plundered it and beat down the walls. The King added greatly to the fortifications, and ſtrengthened the fortreſs with ſeveral new works. The ſurprize of Berwick by the Scotch, is ſpoken of with ſome incredible circumſtances: <hi>Steward Earl of Angus,</hi> with <hi>Earl March,</hi> having collected a powerful navy, from different parts of Scotland, in which they embarked a choſen band of ſoldiers, entered Tweed in a dark night, and landed the forces under the walls unperceived: by break of day, with ſcaling ladders, they mounted the wall at Cowgate, and overpowered the guard; after which they ſoon made themſelves maſters of the whole town. It ſeems probable there was ſome treachery in favour of the Scotch aſſailants.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Berwick Caſtle</hi> afterwards had many changes of poſſeſſors. In the year 1377, ſeven intrepid and valiant Scots made themſelves maſters of it in the night, killed the Governor, <hi>Sir Robert Boynton,</hi> and gave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to his Lady under a ranſom of 2000 marks. But theſe heroes did not long poſſeſs their honourable acquiſition, for the <hi>Earls of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Lucy, Neville,</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> with ſeveral other Engliſh Nobles, ſoon after inveſted the place, took the fortreſs by ſtorm, and put the Scots to the ſword, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to the number of 48: but this was not effected till the ſmall garriſon had held out eight days againſt 7000 Engliſh archers and 3000 horſe, and during the aſſault loſt only two of their number. The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbrians ſoon after ravaged the territories of Lord March, in revenge for his deſtroying the town of Roxburgh. The above-mentioned ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was effected in the night before the feaſt of St. Andrew. The leader, ſome authors ſay, was the valiant <hi>Sir John Gordon,</hi> but the Engliſh Hiſtorians alledge it was <hi>Alexander Ramſey.</hi> When the <hi>Earl of Northumberland</hi> ſummoned them to ſurrender, they anſwered with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, <q>that they would not yield it either to the King of England or Scotland, but would retain and defend it for the King of France.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1384, the Scotch gained Berwick, by corrupting the Deputy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. The <hi>Duke of Lancaſter,</hi> then in enmity with <hi>Henry Percy</hi> Earl of Northumberland, poſſeſſing the King's ear, improved this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance greatly to the Earl's diſadvantage, and he was in conſequence attainted of high treaſon, as having been guilty of treachery; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his poſſeſſions were forfeited. The Earl thinking his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence before Berwick was of the firſt conſequence, with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army beſieged the town; but bloodſhed was ſpared by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret application of 2000 marks, which regained the place. This event operated ſo powerfully as to gain the King's pardon, and reſtitution to the Earl of his poſſeſſions and honours.<note n="*" place="bottom">A.

               <p>A conſpiracy and inſurrection were formed in the year 1405, againſt King Henry IV, in which the <hi>Earl of Northumberland,</hi> the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of York, Thomas Mowbray,</hi> ſon of the then Duke of Norfolk He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Earl Marſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0085300202:82"/>
The <hi>Earl of Northumberland</hi> could not brook the indignities his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign had heaped upon him; for beſide the grief he ſuſtained in the loſs of his ſon who fell at the battle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the execution of his brother, he had the mortification to ſee the King's third ſon John, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the office of High Conſtable, which the King had conferred on the Earl for life, with the Wardenſhip of the Eaſt Marches; he alſo was deprived of the office of Warden of the Weſt Marches, in favour of the <hi>Earl of Weſtmoreland.</hi> The King demanded the reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the caſtles of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> and in contempt of the general act of grace for the remiſſion of all offences, paſſed after the battle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> ſent out commiſſioners to compound with the Earl's adherents, and grant them ſeparate charters. The Archbiſhop, and Earl Marſhal were apprehended, before the Earl of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land could join them with his forces, and ſuffered execution at York. <hi>The Earl of Northumberland</hi> held the caſtle of <hi>Berwick.</hi> On the King's arrival at Pontefract, he ordered a confiſcation of all the Earl's eſtates, and commanded the Sheriff of Yorkſhire, to ſummon the whole military power of his county, to rendezvous at Newcaſtle. The force with which the King proceeded on this expedition, was no leſs than 37,000 men, with engines and artillery for a ſiege. This powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament alarming the Earl, with his grandſon, the ſon of <hi>Henry Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur,</hi> and <hi>Bardolph,</hi> he retired privily from Berwick, and took refuge in Scotland. <hi>Sir William Greyſtock</hi> was left to command the fortreſs. King Henry on his march ſummoned the caſtle of <hi>Warkworth</hi> to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, but it was not yielded to him, till after a ſiege of eight days, when the garriſon capitulated on the honourable terms of departing with their horſes and accoutrements.

The army advanced to <hi>Berwick,</hi> and made the uſual preparations for a regular ſiege, whilſt the Governor on his part purſued the neceſſary manoeuvres, for a vigorous defence, in hopes of receiving ſuccour from Scotland, which had been promiſed him by the Earl on his departure. The royal army had ſome pieces of ordnance, engines of deſtruction which had never before appeared againſt the fortifications of <hi>Berwick;</hi> and which Speed, by the authority of Walſingham, ſays, were on this occaſion, for the firſt time, employed in Britain.

of the fortifications were then new, the ſame having been conſtructed by King James III. of Scotland, after the ſurrender above mentioned, who had expended a large ſum in ſtrengthening and rebuilding the walls of the town, repairing the caſtle, and furniſhing it with a compleat arrangement of artillery. The aſſailants flattered themſelves, from the newneſs of the works, they ſhould be able to beat them down without much difficulty, and eaſily win the place; but although conſiderable breaches were effected, the garriſon made ſo brave a defence, that after ſpending a great part of the winter in carrying on the ſiege, the Engliſh were obliged to raiſe it, and retire with diſgrace.</p>
               <p>King Edward IV. in the year 1482, about the beginning of July marſhalled his army at <hi>Alnwick,</hi> amounting to 22,000 men, the van of which was led by <hi>Henry Earl of Northumberland.</hi> So great a force appearing unexpectedly on the banks of Tweed oppoſite to <hi>Berwick,</hi> the town made no reſiſtance, and was immediately ſeized by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. <hi>Lord Hales,</hi> who commanded the <hi>caſtle,</hi> having anſwered that he was determined not to ſurrender it, 4000 men under the command of <hi>Lord Stanley, Sir John Elrington, and Sir William Parr,</hi> were left to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it, whilſt the main army marched into Scotland.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 432.</note> The great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion which ſhortly after took place in the Scottiſh ſtate, it is ſaid, was <hi>Lord Hales</hi>'s ſole motive for ſurrendering the <hi>caſtle</hi> on the 24th day of the ſucceeding Auguſt, he having no hope of ſuccours. On the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding truce <hi>Berwick</hi> was given up to England, and the Scots engaged never again to attempt by any art the reduction of it. Since which time it has conſtantly remained in the poſſeſſion of the Crown of England.</p>
               <p>In the reigns of King Richard III. and King James III. of Scotland, Commiſſioners were appointed by the two Crowns, to ſet the limits of <hi>Berwick;</hi> on which occaſion the diſputed ground was agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main uncultivated, unbuilt, and uninhabited.</p>
               <p>In the treaty and convention entered into by King Henry VII. and James IV. King of Scotland, A. D. 1502, it was ſtipulated, that the <hi>town</hi> and <hi>caſtle</hi> of <hi>Berwick,</hi> with their ancient bounds and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, ſhould for ever remain and be included in the preſent perpetual peace, friendſhip, league, and confederacy: ſo that neither the King of Scotland, his heirs and ſucceſſors, nor any of them, ſhould

by themſelves, or any of their ſubjects, lieges, or vaſſals, make or ſuffer to be made war, inſult, ambuſh, or ſiege, publicly or privately, againſt the places themſelves or their inhabitants; nor the King of England, his heirs, ſucceſſors, or any of them, ſhould by themſelves or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the town and caſtle, make any war inſult or ſiege on the King of Scotland or his vaſſals.</p>
               <p>In the month of January, A. D. 1502, James IV. King of Scotland, eſpouſed Margaret eldeſt daughter of King Henry VII. In Leland's Collectanea is a record, ſtiled <q>The Fyancelles of Margaret eldeſt daughter of King Henry VII. to James King of Scotland: Together with her departure from England, journey into Scotland, her recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and marriaged there, and the great feaſts held on that account.

               <p>On the 10th day of October A. D. 1525, a treaty was concluded at <hi>Berwick,</hi> between the Commiſſioners of King Henry VIII. and King James V. for a three-years peace; and in the year 1528, the truce was renewed, and the peace continued for five years.</p>
               <p>In the year 1547, King Henry VIII. being dead, leaving his ſon Edward VI. an infant of ten years of age, the <hi>Earl of Hertford,</hi> then created <hi>Duke of Somerſet,</hi> in the month of Auguſt, advanced to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> with an army of 18,000 men, attended by a fleet of 34 ſhips of war, 30 tranſports and a galley, on an expedition to Scotland.<note n="*" place="bottom">See an account of the devaſtations made on this expedition, p. 37.</note> The army lay encamped without the walls of the town.</p>
               <p>In the year 1550, great repairs were made in the fortreſs of <hi>Berwick,</hi> the expence of which, with the repairs of Calais, are alledged in the King's Journals as the reaſon for debaſing the coin; from thence it alſo appears, ſome of the walls had fallen, the foundations having been ſhaken by working a bulwark.

The fort then erected was contrived to have four bulwarks, for erecting which the wall was to have been left open, on the enemy's ſide, for a conſiderable ſpace; but as this was dangerous and expenſive, it was reſolved the wall ſhould be ſtrengthened by an additional wall, and two ſlaughter-houſes, to ſcour the outer cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

No veſtiges of theſe works now appearing, it is to be preſumed they were raſed, when Queen Elizabeth put the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon a regular and modern plan.</p>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0085300202:91"/>In the reigns of King Edward VI. and Queen Mary of Scotland, <hi>Berwick</hi> by treaty was made <hi>a county town,</hi> and as Rymer's Faedra notes it, "a free town independant of both ſtates."</p>

               <p>In the year 1566, Queen Mary of Scotland came into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to view <hi>Berwick;</hi> ſhe was met at the extreme of the liberties by the Deputy Governor and his train, who conducted her firſt to <hi>Hallidon Hill,</hi> and thence to the weſt of the town, where ſhe had a perfect view of the place, and was ſaluted by a general diſcharge of the ordnance.</p>
               <p>In 1588, King James VI. of Scotland did the like, and received the ſame ſalute.</p>
               <p>Queen Elizabeth having fortified <hi>Berwick,</hi> made the following mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eſtabliſhment there, in the year 1576, as appears by the archieves of the borough.</p>

The roads were lined with people, who on all ſides joined in the loudeſt acclamations.</p>
               <p>When his Majeſty entered the gate, the keys of the town were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, by <hi>William Selby,</hi> Gentleman Porter; who was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately knighted, and the keys were returned.

The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid to this part of the charge veſted in the body corporate, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appear in more favourable language, than contained in the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement given in the note.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Publiſhed in the Newcaſtle newſpaper, Oct. 20, 1750.</p>
                     <p>The public Grammar School of Berwick upon Tweed, being vacant by the reſignation of the late maſter, the Guild has determined to fill the employment, by the moſt deſerving man they can find to undertake the charge.</p>
                     <p>Notice is hereby given, that the ſaid employment will be diſpoſed of on Thurſday the 27th of December next, at Berwick, where the candidates are deſired at that day, to make their perſonal appearance.</p>
                     <p>The corporation being duly ſenſible of the high importance of the charge, and how much the principles of the ſociety may be corrupted, their morals debauched, and the public peace diſturbed, by the jacobitiſm, bigotry, looſe morals, imprudence, or ill temper of the perſon that is intruſted with their children, at an age ſuſceptible of every impreſſion, deſire that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is willing to offer themſelves as candidates for ſuch employment, may, on or before the 27th of November, ſend certificates ſealed up and encloſed, to the Town Clerk of Berwick, under the hands of gentlemen of probity and knowledge, of their zeal for liberty and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſtitution, their ſobriety, moderation, good conduct and temper, as the corporation is reſolved to commit that care to the perſon who ſhall appear beſt qualified: and therefore after the attention to their characters in theſe reſpects, gentlemen of undoubted honour will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to examine into the learning of the perſons beſt recommended.</p>
                     <p>The maſter has a commodious dwelling-houſe and garden; the ſalary for teaching freemen's children is 60l. per annum, and 10s. a quarter for teaching every unfreeman's child; out of which the maſter is to provide himſelf with an uſher, at a yearly ſalary not leſs than 20l. who is to be approved by the Guild.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The chief <hi>imports</hi> of the <hi>port of Berwick</hi> are from Norway and the Baltic, conſiſting of timber and deals: the <hi>exports,</hi> corn, wool, ſalmon, and eggs; the latter of which articles, though apparently ſmall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant in the liſt, yet brings in an annual ſum of 13 or 14,000l. they being ſent to London for the uſe of ſugar refiners, &amp;c. packed in boxes the thick end down.</p>
               <p>The ſalmon fiſhery here is very conſiderable. Mr Pennant ſpeaks of it in the following terms: <q>They lay on each ſide the river, and are all private property, except what belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Durham, which in rent and tithe of fiſh, brings in 450l. per annum: for all the other fiſheries are liable to tithe. The common rents of theſe are 50l. a year, for which tenants have as much ſhore, as ſerves to launch out and draw their nets on ſhore; the limits of each are ſtaked, and I obſerved that the fiſhers never failed going as near as poſſible to their neighbour's limits. One man goes off in a ſmall flat-bottomed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0085300202:101"/>
boat, ſquare at one end; and taking as large a circuit as his net admits, brings it on ſhore at the extremity of his boundary, where others aſſiſt in landing it. The beſt fiſhery is on the ſouth ſide; very fine ſalmon trout are often taken here, which come up from the ſea to ſpawn, and return in the ſame manner as the ſalmon do. For a fuller account of this fiſhery, vide Britiſh Zoology III. 241. To it may alſo be added, that in the middle of the river, not a mile weſt of the town, is a large ſtone, on which a man is placed, to obſerve what is called the <hi>Reck</hi> of the ſalmon coming up.</q>

               </p>
               <p>After having mentioned the evidences of antiquity, it is requiſite, before I quit the ſubject, I ſhould ſpeak of <hi>Berwick</hi> in its natural ſtate. Being built on an angular point of land, at the mouth of Tweed, on two ſides it is bounded by water: the ſea in this part of the channel is tempeſtuous and rough, the tide ſetting in very ſtrong, occaſions a heavy ſurge, which increaſed by frequent ſtorms, renders the coaſt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous. The proſpect of the ocean conveys to the contemplative mind, a grand aſſociation of images, which deſcribe the might and majeſty of the Creator. As I walked the banks, imagination roved at large, but took a melancholy ſtrain; I conceived I heard the alarm guns fired at Bambrough Caſtle, and the ſignal of diſtreſs waved in my Fancy's eye, from ſome veſſel at a diſtance. The ocean, which before had affected my ſoul with a ſcene of magnificent delight, now ſeemed full of horror and diſmay; the rolling billows became tremendous, the yawning gulph an object of gloomy terror, the whole conveyed the apprehenſion of imminent peril and diſtreſs; and in the end, all the agonies of a diſtracted crew, who laboured for life, filled my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the wanderings of Fancy were replete with diſmay and miſery.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of <hi>Berwick</hi> have enough of ſuch horrid ſcenes: the coaſt is terrible to mariners. After having once been witneſs to ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy an event, one would ſcarce ever look upon the ſea again with pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Land Proſpect</hi> doth not produce a ſcene wild enough to be called romantic, or ſufficiently cultivated, to be ſmooth, placid, and agreeable.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0085300202:102"/>
The banks of Tweed loſs much of their ſweetneſs in the environs of the town; and Flora reſerves moſt of her beauties for the neighbourhood of <hi>Kelſo</hi> and <hi>Coldſtream.</hi> Below Berwick bridge, there is not enough either of trade or tranquillity; it poſſeſſes the middle ſtation; neither buſy enough nor enough at reſt, is dulneſs. Above bridge, in the fiſhing ſeaſon, the ſcene is beautifully enlivened. Below, ſome few veſſels are moored, but too often the heavy hulks are turned up on the dry ſands, with maſts unrigged, waiting for trade and tide. Such are dull objects to the eye, and have no other effect upon the ſpectator than to promote wearineſs and impatiency.</p>
               <p>Over the arm of the ſea which breaks upon the bar of Tweed, the lands to the ſouthward are extended for ſeveral miles upon the view, varied with the happy colourings which ſucceed to cultivation; but the diſtance is ſo great, that objects are indiſtinct, and the beauties of the landſkip lay in confuſion: two often indeed the whole is enveloped in ſea vapour.</p>
               <p>I cannot take my departure from the banks of Tweed, without paſſing ſome few thoughts on the carnage and bloodſhed, which for ages ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them famous to the arms of both the Scotch and Engliſh; and to poſterity made their hiſtory a ſubject of horror and deteſtation.</p>
               <p>Alberic Biſhop of Oſtia, being ſent as Legate from Pope Innocent II. on his viſitation at Carliſle, is ſaid to have taken great pains to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the army of King David of Scotland, after the retreat from the battle of Alerton, that they ought to wage war with greater humanity; and prevailed with them ſo far as to gain the releaſe of the female cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whom they were carrying as ſlaves into Scotland. He alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their ſolemn engagement, that in future inroads they would not violate the churches and religious houſes; and would alſo ſpare from the ſword, women, infants, and the aged. Theſe ſhew to us what were the infamous enormities committed in theſe expeditions.</p>
               <p>The war carried on between the two nations, was as brutal as any in the annals of the Caribbees, or any ſavages under the ſun. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic injuries of ſtates, the policy of empires, the balance of trade, the peace of Europe, or the equilibrium of power, were not the objects of warfare: like the wild Arabs, the eſtate of the people was that of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, rapine and plunder their objects; as if devoid of all religious ſenſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0085300202:103"/>
of oaths and moral obligations, the compacts of ſtates, and the ties of honour and moral honeſty, they often forſook every principle for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and like barbarians, levied war for the ſake of pillaging, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, and retribution. When the wolves deſcend the Alps upon the villages, it is the effect of hunger in its extreme; but here the blood of the peaſant was ſhed without any cogency of cauſe, but the lucre of his herds, flocks, and poſſeſſions. The immortal <hi>King John</hi> burnt, laid waſte, and deſtroyed half the iſland, from York northward: Alexander in all his glory never exhibited a more noble conflagration. Edward contaminated his honours with many of thoſe atchievements. Torrents of blood have iſſued from theſe borders; they were the common char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the two nations. Thirty-three thouſand ſouls fled in one day to the gates of eternity, diſpatched by the command of Princes, who could not account to heaven what it was they fought for. The petit maſſacres were equally as inconſiderate; the heroes of thoſe bands walked forth with their adherents, imbruing their hands in human gore, burning and deſtroying, laying waſte towers, towns and villages, and ſpreading deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in the moſt ſavage manner, for the reward of ſavages: reciprocal ſlaughters, devaſtations, and cruelties marked both people. When the moſt valiant atchievements were performed, even in the preſence of their Princes, revenge appeared to be the only inſtigation, and common juſtice was ſeldom conſidered. What was the battle of Allerton, in the reign of Stephen, when David with a mighty ſlaughter was overthrown, after having ravaged Northumberland and Durham, returning like a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed miſcreant, with his hands red in the blood of thouſands of his band of robbers! William King of Scotland was a priſoner on one of his incurſions: he witneſſed a cruel ſlaughter of his people. Our Edward I. ſlew 60,000 at Falkirk; Edward III. ſlew his tens of thouſands at Hally-down Hill; and Penrith and Durham witneſſed to the ſucceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction made of the Scots in this reign under their unfortunate David, who in the battle at the laſt-mentioned place was made priſoner. The battles of Otterburn and Flodden Field were upon the ſame principles as the others.—How doth this retroſpection fully the hero, ſtain the luſtre of his arms, and the honour of his valour! yet it is too true ſuch were the conflicts on the borders, and ſuch the arms that waged the inglorious warfare on this once wretched, but now moſt happy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; at this time abounding with wealth, flowing from peace, by the channels of cultivation, manufactory, and trade: where the brethren of one climate and one iſland, under the bleſſed protection of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon father, and a conſtitution admired and envied by all the world,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0085300202:104"/>
are acting together in a ſtate of mutual offices, to contribute to the general opulence and felicity.</p>
               <p>How baneful and obnoxious is he to the common intereſts of this now united family, who attempts to ſow the ſeeds of diſſatisfaction and jealouſy, and through calumnies ariſing in the venom of malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and diſappointed ambition endeavours to cultivate contempt and averſion between the brethren of this land! The ſtrength of this, and every nation, is the union of its inhabitants—he who blows up the embers of extinguiſhed feuds, is particularly an enemy to both parties, and a foe to the ſtate at large.</p>
               <p>The acceſſion of King James the VI. to the Crown of England, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated powerfully towards the felicity of this part of the iſland; cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediately took place, the country ſo often deſolated by war, received new inhabitants, who brought with them not only flocks and herds, but alſo manufactories and commerce: the works effected in peace were ſoon diſtinguiſhed, the barren waſtes were put under the plough ſhare, towns and hamlets diverſified the ſcene, and increaſing population enlivened every valley, which for ages had been marked by works of hoſtility. Yet it was not till the union of the two kingdoms, that theſe effects of peace were brought to the happy eminence now diſcovered on every hand. As to political advantages, it is evident, their diſcuſſion comes not within my plan in this work; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of their vaſt importance to both nations: Mrs Macauley ſays, <q>on very ſound principles of policy, the union had been ſeveral times rejected by both nations; and which was with great difficulty coerced on the Scots: though as Burnet obſerves, the advantages which were offered to Scotland, in the whole frame of it, were great and viſible. The Scots were to bear leſs than the fortieth part of the public taxes, and they were to have the eleventh part of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Trade was to be free all over the iſland, and to the plantations; private rights were to be preſerved; and the judicature and laws of Scotland were ſtill to be continued.</q>

Moſt of your M—'s friends having left Edinburgh before the arrival of Colonel Hooke, all that we could do was to act in concert, in ſigning the memorial: and as the memorial is not ſo ample as ſome of us could have wiſhed, we have deſired the Colonel to ſupply what is wanting therein, by repreſenting ſeveral things, concerning which we have inſtructed him. He will alſo inform your M—, how much this nation is generally well affected to your ſervice, and with how much pleaſure we ſhall venture our lives and fortunes for ſo juſt a cauſe.

                                       <p>All the delays which we have ſuffered have not diminiſhed our zeal, though they have prolonged our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and misfortunes.</p>
                                       <p>Colonel Hooke has been ſo well received among us, that he is able to give an exact account of his negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which will not diſpleaſe your M—.</p>
                                       <p>I confeſs, that after having waited for him for a long while, our ſervour began to diminiſh, in proportion to our hopes; but his prudence and good conduct joined to his indefatigable diligence, has revived our ardor; and he has put our affairs into ſo good order, that we hope they will come to an happy iſſue. The preſent opportunity is looked upon by all as the beſt that has ever offered, and the laſt that will offer for a long time.</p>
                                       <p>All ranks of people earneſtly demand their K—, and the Scots will certainly return univerſally and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to their duty towards their lawful S—.</p>

                              </note> yet I am of opinion, that the fancies they have taken up will ſoon vaniſh, and will not be the hinderance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding a treaty.</p>

                              <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0085300202:104"/>Upon the 4th current the houſe came to a queſtion, <q>Approve the firſt article of the treaty or not?</q>—With this proviſion, that if other articles be not adjuſted by the parliament, the agreeing to the firſt ſhould be of no effect.</p>
                           <p>The voters preſent were 199, of which 116 were approvers, 83 were oppoſers; of theſe 66 entered their diſſent and proteſted—17 would not join in the diſſent, becauſe they differed from the approvers, only in that they were not for putting a queſtion upon the firſt article, till votes ſhould paſs on the 4th, 5th, and ſome other following articles: and I think, the moſt part of, if not all the 17, are for an entire union, if the terms pleaſe them.</p>
                           <p>Several very underſtanding and well affected members find difficulties in ſome of the articles, whereof they apprehend ſome to be inſuperable, unleſs they meet with a remedy from the wiſdom of England.</p>
                           <p>Many of the more judicious members are little moved by the croſs humour raiſed among the people, by the pains of ill-deſigning men, while it is founded only upon ſpeculation, for they think that will vaniſh. But if the mulitude of the lower people, ſhall at the beginning feel a ſenſible prejudice by the execution of any article, then the danger may prove greater among a hot ſtubborn vulgar, than can well be foreſeen.</p>
                           <p>I cannot yet condeſcend upon particulars, which I will do when I am able to explain them more diſtinctly: this I can ſay in the general, that I am only apprehenſive of ſuch things as may univerſally affect the common people, before they can have much reliſh of the advantages which certainly will in courſe be the product and fruit of an union.</p>
                           <p>In the beginning of this ſeſſion, thoſe who in the laſt were called the new party, made up of the Peers and Gentlemen who were laid aſide from public employment and the council in the year 1705, and others their friends upon whom they have influence, who have ſtill ſtuck toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, above 24 in number, were ſuſpected that they would go croſs to the Miniſters: but God
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0085300202:107"/>be thanked they have not done ſo, for which they merit eſteem and thanks from all who wiſh well to her Majeſty and her kingdoms. They have carried themſelves and concurred as perſons of honour and underſtanding, for promoting the common good, without any appearance of reſentment towards thoſe now employed. Whereas if they had joined with the oppoſers of the union, the promoters of it here were not able to carry it through.</p>
                           <p>As for the <hi>proteſters,</hi> I am confident, the far greater part, if not all of them, are deſigning to make way for the ST GERMAINS YOUTH, and to divide theſe kingdoms.<note n="*" place="bottom">Voltaire ſpeaking of the Tories attempting to replace the Stuart family on the throne of England, is thus noted by his tranſlator Smollet: <q>We can affirm, on the very beſt authority, that the Tories never harboured any ſuch deſign: there might indeed be ſome Jacobites among them, who ſecretly entertained notions of that kind, but theſe they carefully concealed from the party with which they aſſociated. Some too were driven into Jacobitiſm by hard uſage; but the Tories in general had no intention to alter that ſucceſſion which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had eſtabliſhed.</q>
                              </note> They well diſcern that an union extinguiſhes all hopes of that ſort; and therefore they will certainly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any means that can prevent an union. But as the friends to it cannot miſs to out-vote the other, if inſuperable difficulties of the kind I have mentioned be not found in ſome of the articles; or if found, be removed or redreſſed by the prudent aſſiſtance of your Lordſhip, and ſuch as you in your parliament; I doubt not the treaty will be brought to a happy concluſion, which I heartily wiſh, and wherein I ſhall labour to be as much aſſiſtant here as can be in the power of,</p>

                           <p>The difficulties and warm debates which happened in the houſe, led me to delay the ſending my letter, till I could give you this further account.</p>
                           <p>The 2d, 3d, and 4th articles of the treaty are approved, with the like proviſion as the firſt is; but the carrying of theſe votes was with a great deal of wrangle and conteſt: even as much upon the 4th (wherein we expected little reſiſtance) as upon any of the former; whereby it is eaſy to diſcern the deſign of the oppoſers. Yet our greater difficulty is to keep many by whom we muſt carry our votes, from being miſled by the deſigning oppoſers, with the ſubtle pretences they make; ſo plauſible, as are of danger to prevail upon the leſs underſtanding ſort of well-meaning perſons.</p>
                           <p>The 5th article is this day approved, with this alteration. <q>The Diet is changed from the time of ſigning the treaty for the union, to the time of ratifying the treaty.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>"I know not how your parliament may like this, but I am hopeful that an affair of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold advantages to this iſland, as an entire union may prove, will not ſtop upon differences of leſſer moment.</p>
                           <p>What I foreſee of this ſort, brings to my remembrance a very old treaty betwixt Reheboam and the tribes of Iſrael; and of the wiſe advice which the old Counſellors gave him. This ſimilitude halts, as commonly all do; yet I believe your Lordſhip will find ſomething in it that may be of uſe.</p>

                           <q>Bede calls it a Semi Iſland, being as he juſtly obſerves, twice an iſland and twice continent in one day; for at the flowing of the tide it is encompaſſed by water, and at the ebb there is an almoſt dry paſſage, both for horſes and carriages to and from the main land; from which if meaſured in a ſtraight line it is diſtant about two miles eaſtward; but on account of ſome quick ſands paſſengers are obliged to make ſo many detours, that the length of the way is nearly doubled, the water over theſe flats at ſpring tides is only ſeven feet.</q>

The iſland chiefly conſiſts of one continued plain, inclining to the ſouth-weſt. The land on which the village ſtands, riſes ſwiftly from the ſhore; at the ſouthern point, is a rock of a conical figure, and almoſt perpendicular, near 60 feet in height, having on its lofty crown a ſmall fortreſs or caſtle, which makes at once a groteſque and formidable appearance. I did not obſerve one tree upon the iſland.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>The village conſiſts of a few ſcattered houſes, two of which are Inns, the reſt chiefly inhabited by fiſhermen. The ſhore is excellent for bathing, and the ſituation at once healthy and romantic: it is ſurpriſing it ſhould be ſo little reſorted to. The north and eaſt coaſts of the iſland are formed of perpendicular rocks, the other ſides ſink by gradual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations towards the ſands. The rock on which the caſtle ſtands, is acceſſible only by a winding paſs cut on its ſouthern ſide: the narrow limits of its crown will not admit of many works, the whole ſtrength conſiſting of a ſingle battery on the ſouth-eaſt point, mounted with ſeven or eight guns, which commands the approach to the iſland from the ſea; but would be of little conſequence againſt a ſhip of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force. The reſt of the ſummit is taken up with a houſe for the Governor and guard, the walls of which ſtand on the very brink of the precipice. This fortreſs, before the uſe of gunpowder, from its
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0085300202:110"/>
ſituation appears to have been impregnable, the ſuperſtructures being above the reach of any engine, and the rocks too high to be ſcaled. The antiquity of this <hi>caſtle</hi> is not known, but I ſhould preſume it is coeval with the <hi>abbey,</hi> and was uſed as a place of reſort in times of peril, and a ſtronghold for the religious, whenever they were diſturbed in their holy retreat. The preſent fortifications appear to be the work of the laſt century. In the military eſtabliſhment made by Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth for <hi>Berwick</hi> in 1576, the caſtle is noted, and a patent for life was granted to <hi>Sir William Read</hi> as keeper of the fortreſſes of <hi>Holy Iſland</hi> and <hi>Farn,</hi> with a yearly payment of 362l. 17s. 6d. per annum.</p>
               <p>The ingenious Mr Groſe gives the following anecdotes relative to this caſtle:—<q>Camden mentions it, ſo that it is evidently as old as his time. Probably it has been the ſcene of very few remarkable events: hiſtory being nearly as ſilent with reſpect to them, as concerning its origin. The firſt time it occurs, is in the hiſtory of the civil war in the time of Charles I. when it appears to have been ſeized for the Parliament; and according to Ruſhworth, in an order of the Houſe of Commons, May 7th, 1646, for ſending forces thither, this reaſon is aſſigned, "it being of ſuch conſequence to the northern parts of the kingdom. Probably this conſequence aroſe, more for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of its harbour, than the ſtrength of the caſtle."</q>

                  <q>In the year 1647, one Captain Batton was Governor of the iſland, for the Parliament; to whom Sir Marmaduke Langdale, after the taking of Berwick, wrote the following letter, but without ſucceſs. The letter, together with the Captain's refuſal, were tranſmitted to the Houſe of Commons, for which they voted their thanks to Captain Batton, and that he ſhould be continued Governor of the place.</q>

From that time nothing memorable ſeems to have been tranſacted here, till the rebellion in the year 1715, when the ſeizure of this caſtle was planned and performed by two men only. In which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, ſuch policy and courage were exerted, as would have done them much honour, had they been employed in a better cauſe. The following particulars of the ſtory were communicated by a Gentleman whoſe father was an eye-witneſs to the facts, and well knew both the parties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>One Lancelot Errington, a man of an ancient and reſpectable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in Northumberland, and of a bold and enterprizing ſpirit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a conſpiracy for ſeizing this caſtle for the Pretender; in which it is ſaid, he was promiſed aſſiſtance not only by Mr Forſter, the rebel General then in arms, but alſo by the maſters of ſeveral French privateers. At this time the garriſon conſiſted of a ſerjeant, a corporal, and 10 or 12 men only. In order to put this ſcheme in execution, being well known in that country, he went to the caſtle, and after ſome diſcourſe with the ſerjeant, invited him and the reſt of the men, who were not immediately on duty, to partake of a treat on board of the ſhip of which he was maſter, then lying in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: this being unſuſpectingly accepted of, he ſo well plied his gueſts with brandy, that they were ſoon incapable of any oppoſition. Theſe men being thus ſecured, he made ſome pretence for going on ſhore; and with Mark Errington his nephew, returning again to the caſtle, they knocked down the centinel, ſurprized and turned out an old gunner, the corporal, and two other ſoldiers, being the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the garriſon, and ſhutting the gates, hoiſted the Pretender's colours as a ſignal of their ſucceſs, anxiouſly expecting the promiſed ſuccours. No reinforcement coming, but on the contrary a party of the King's troops arriving from Berwick, they were obliged to retreat
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0085300202:112"/>
over the walls of the caſtle, among the rocks, hoping to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the ſea weeds till it was dark, and then by ſwimming to the main land, to make their eſcape: but the tide riſing, they were obliged to ſwim, when the ſoldiers firing at Lancelot as he was climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a rock, wounded him in the thigh. Thus diſabled, he and his nephew were taken and conveyed to Berwick gaol, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till his wound was cured. During this time he had digged a burrow quite under the foundations of the priſon, depoſiting the earth taken out in an old oven. Through this burrow he and his nephew, with divers other priſoners, eſcaped; but moſt of the latter were ſoon after taken. The two Erringtons however had the good fortune to make their way to the Tweedſide, where they found the cuſtom-houſe boat; they rowed themſelves over, and afterwards turned it adrift. From thence they purſued their journey to Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough Caſtle, near which they were concealed nine days in a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtack; a relation who reſided in the caſtle ſupplying them with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. At length travelling in the night by ſecret paths, they reached Gateſhead Houſe, near Newcaſtle, where they were ſecreted till they procured a paſſage from Sunderland to France. A reward of 500l. was now offered to any one who would apprehend them; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, Lancelot was ſo daring as ſoon after to come into England, and even to viſit ſome of his friends in Newgate. After the ſuppreſſion of the rebellion, when every thing was quiet, he and his nephew took the benefit of the general pardon, and returned to Newcaſtle, where he died about the year 1746, as it is ſaid, of grief at the victory of Culloden.</q>

               <p>The remains of the old <hi>abbey</hi> in the next place require my attention; ſuch parts of this cathedral are ſtanding as give a perfect idea of its original form and appearance. The <hi>monaſtery</hi> is in ragged ruins, and not worthy to be delineated, the walls having been robbed for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the village, and the erection of the preſent parochial church.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid by ſome authors, that the <hi>monaſtery</hi> was built by <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> of a plain model, without ornament, and encloſed with a high wall, in order that outward objects might not withdraw the attention of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety from their divine contemplations.</p>
               <p>In Mr Weſt's Antiquities of <hi>Furneſs Abbey,</hi> we have this ſhort account of the riſe and origin of Monaſtic Orders. <q>Soon after the chriſtian
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0085300202:113"/>
religion had made ſome conſiderable progreſs in the eaſt, the policy of the Roman empire expoſed the profeſſors of it to many and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, and a ſucceſſion of bloody perſecutions: the two laſt under Decius and Diocleſian more eſpecially obliged many to betake themſelves to mountains, deſerts, and ſolitary places, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the unrelenting fury of theſe bloody tyrants: there they found a ſafe retreat, with time and liberty to give themſelves up to the exerciſes of piety and divine contemplation, in a courſe of moſt rigorous mortifications, and preternatural auſterities. This kind of life, which neceſſity gave riſe to, was afterwards in the time of the Chriſtian Emperors, embraced through choice; and <hi>Pacomius</hi> about the middle of the 4th century, committed to writing rules for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſocieties, and founded ſome monaſteries in the environs of Thebes in Egypt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The introduction of Monks into England, is ſpoken of as a maſter-piece of policy in the court of Rome, as endeavouring thereby to ſecure her authority by an increaſe of property, which would ariſe to her by the pious donations and offerings of the faithful, and the founding of many religious houſes, to be occupied by ſuch as were, from the nature of their inſtitute, attached to the Holy See, and might occaſionally ſerve every purpoſe of ſpiritual tyranny. And it is alledged, that the Monks by the auſterity of their religion and morals faſcinated the minds of the people, and by their pretenſion to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſanctity, ſecured a ſubmiſſion to all their deciſions, and an implicit obedience to all their doctrines. This is a heavy charge, and if well grounded, ſhould have prevented the monaſtic rule from ever taking effect in any kingdom, or occaſioned its ruin as ſoon as the diſcovery was made, or the charge formed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This he obviates, by monaſteries being eſtabliſhed here before Auſtin's time; and takes for his authorities Gildas and Bede, as to their being ſchools of chriſtian learning. He adds, <q>in all this, we hear nothing of foreign connections, of ſiniſter inventions, or hypocriſy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Roman Pontiff knew how to draw from the circumſtances of William's afrairs, advantages which the Conqueror never intended; and which his immediate ſucceſſors could not prevent, as they were equally or more obliged to the church for her ſupport, than he himſelf had been. The foreign Eccleſiaſtics which the Norman King

introduced, readily gave up the liberty of a country, to which they were ſtrangers, and a happineſs the ſweets whereof they had never known: but from that conſequence, of which the Conqueror and his ſons had made them, they ſoon became ſenſible of ther own impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the foreign Monks, from the great property conferred upon them, ſoon found of what weight they were in the ſcale of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and readily turned it to their own advantages, as occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The introduction, therefore, of ſo many new orders of Monks into England by the Norman Kings, was according to their own policy, and not that of the Court of Rome.</q>—He then takes occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the good offices of the church in favour of the Conqueror's younger ſons, and the Earl of Moreton and King John.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Court of Rome could have no direct hand in all this; and the monaſtick inſtitute, of its own nature, can have no part in either a civil or a ſpiritual tyranny, unleſs where perverted; as the beſt of inſtitutes may have been, by the malice of men.</q>—I have been led to lengthen the quotation beyond the bounds I at firſt intended, to ſhew with what arguments this ſubtle author, and other writers of the like claſs, can put a plauſible countenance on facts, which reflected diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on the See of Rome. But to return from this digreſſion.</p>
               <p>The cathedral is in the form of a croſs, the eaſt and weſt limbs of which are yet ſtanding, the other parts totally in ruins, and almoſt level with the ground. The order of building in this ſtructure is rude and heavy, and moſt of it in the worſt mode of the early Saxon architecture. Mr Groſe ſays, <q>probably it was the work of different periods; great part of it ſeems very ancient, the arches being circular, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns very maſſy and much like thoſe at Durham, but richer. On the north and ſouth walls there are pointed arches, which proves that part of it at leaſt was built ſince the reign of Henry II.</q> The pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars on which the arches riſe in the center of the croſs are cluſtered and plain capitalled, each forming the corner of the great tower; theſe arches are of few members. There are two ſide ailes, the columns of which are heavy, and the arches circular: the windows are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ornamented with a corner pilaſter, and a moulding of few members: the walls are very thick, and every part wears a gloomy countenance. The ſouth wall of the middle tower is ſtanding about 50
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0085300202:116"/>
feet high; and one corner tower on the weſt end of the church remains perfect.<note n="*" place="bottom">The cathedral, with the town of Fenham, and the town and church of Norham were given by William de Carilepho, to the monaſtery of Durham. Monaſt. Angl. Vol. 1.</note> Theſe ruins retain at this day one moſt ſingular beauty, the tower has not formed a lanthorn, as in moſt cathedrals; but from the angles, arches ſprang, croſſing each other diagonally, to form a canopy roof. One of thoſe arches yet remains, unloaded with any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure, ſupported by the ſouth-eaſt and north-weſt corner pillars, and ornamented with the dancette or zig-zag moulding, much uſed in old Saxon architecture, extending a fine bow over the chaſm and heap of ruins occaſioned by the falling-in of the ailes. The whole ſtructure is compoſed of a ſoft red free-ſtone, which yields much to time, and renders the aſpect of the building dark and melancholy. Mr Groſe's account comprehends the following particulars:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Various fragments of the offices of this monaſtery are ſtill ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and foundations of buildings are ſcattered over a cloſe of near four acres; the main walls of the church on the north and ſouth ſides are ſtill ſtanding, though much out of the perpendicular; inclining outwards ſo conſiderably, as to make the horizontal diſtance between them, at the top, exceed, by near two feet, that at the bottom. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther winter or two ſeems to be the utmoſt they can ſtand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This building conſiſts of a body and two ſide ailes, into which it is divided by a double row of very ſolid columns, whoſe ſhafts are richly ornamented. Each row has five columns of four different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and two pilaſters in the walls on the eaſt and weſt ends. The ſhafts of theſe columns are about 12 feet high, their diameters about five, their capitals and pedeſtals are plain, they ſupport circular arches, having over each arch two ranges of windows; the loweſt large and in pairs, ſeparated only by a ſhort column; the upper ſmall and ſingle. The length of the building is about 138 feet, the breadth of the body 18 feet, and that of the two ſide ailes about nine feet each.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The proſpect from this iſland is beautiful; to the northward you command the town of <hi>Berwick,</hi> over an arm of the ſea about ſeven miles in breadth: at nearly the ſame diſtance you view <hi>Bambrough Caſtle,</hi> on a bold <hi>promontory,</hi> towards the ſouth: on the one hand you have a

                        <p>The effigies of this Saint were placed at the north door of the entrance into the quire of the cathedral at Durham, underneath which was the following inſcription: <q>Sanctus Aidanus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Scotus, Monachus Monaſterii de Hii, Epiſcopus factus per Oſwaldum vocatus, anno gratiae 635, fundavit ſedem Epiſcopalem &amp; Monachorum congregationem in inſula Lindisfar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſi, ac gentem Berniciorum, co-operante ſancto Oſwaldo ad fidem Chriſti convertit. Hujus Aidani animam ſanctus Cuthbertus ab Angelis in Caelum deferri conſpexit: ejus caput et Oſſa in hac Eccleſia Dunelmenſi, ut ſanctae reliquiae ſunt ſervata.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oſwald,</hi> the ſecond ſon of <hi>Ethelfrid,</hi> ſucceeded to both the kingdoms (<hi>Deira</hi> and <hi>Bernicia</hi>) a noble and virtuous Prince, whoſe chief ſtudy was to promote the chriſtian religion. To this effect he ſent his Embaſſadors unto Donald IV. then reigning in Scotland, and entreated him by the old familiarity that had been among them, to help him with ſome worthy and learned men that could inſtruct his people in the faith of Chriſt. The King recommending the matter to the Clergy, one <hi>Cormanus</hi> was elected to go thither; but his labours proving unprofitable, he returned about the end of the year, and in a ſynod of the Biſhops and Clergy, informed them, that they were a people ſo <hi>indocile and froward,</hi> that the pains taken upon them were loſt, they neither being deſirous nor capable of inſtruction.</p>
                        <p>It grieved the ſynod exceedingly to hear this, and while they were conſulting what to do, <hi>Aidanus,</hi> a learned man and reverend preacher, is ſaid to have adviſed them not to give over the work at any hands, for that the bad ſucceſs of <hi>Cormanus</hi>'s labours might poſſibly proceed from himſelf, that had not uſed the people tenderly, nor according to the Apoſtle's rules <q>fed them at firſt with milk;</q> and therefore deſired ſome other approved man might be employed of new, who would probably do good among them.</p>
                        <p>This opinion allowed by all, none was thought fitter for this ſervice than he who had given the advice; and ſo with common conſent was <hi>Aidan</hi> ordained Biſhop, and appointed to that charge. Being come thither, he ſet himſelf to amend the fault which he ſuppoſed <hi>Corman</hi> had committed, and ſo tempered his doctrine, as multitudes of people daily did reſort unto him to be inſtructed. It was great hinderance unto him at firſt, that he was not ſkilled in the <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue, neither did the people underſtand his language; but this defect the King himſelf ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, interpreting to the auditory all that <hi>Aidanus</hi> delivered in his ſermon: ſo by the King's zeal, and <hi>Aidanus</hi>'s diligence, ſuch numbers were brought to the chriſtian profeſſion, as in the ſpace of ſeven days 15,000 perſons were by him baptized.</p>
                        <p>Whether this people were more happy in their King or in this Biſhop, it is difficult to ſay, for the King he did ſo excel in piety and prudence, that, as <hi>Beda</hi> writes, all the nations and provinces within Britain were at his devotion; and not the leſs his heart was never lifted up within him, but ſtill he ſhewed himſelf courteous and affable, and of the poor moſt compaſſionate. Among examples of his liberality towards theſe, the ſame <hi>Beda</hi> related, that ſitting at table on Eaſter-day, and <hi>Aidanus</hi> by him, when it was told that a number of poor men were at the gate expecting his alms, he commanded to carry the meat that was ſet before him unto them, and the platter of ſilver wherein it was to be broke in pieces, and diſtributed among them. <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> beholding it, took the King by the right hand, and kiſſing it, ſaid, <hi>"Nunquam marceſca haec manus,"</hi> never let this hand conſume or wither; which, as he writeth, came alſo to paſs, for being killed in battle, and his arm and his hand cut off, the ſame was encloſed in a ſilver ſhrine, and remained for many years uncorrupted, in the church of St. Peter, at <hi>Bambrough.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to <hi>Aidanus,</hi> he was an enſample of abſtinence, ſobriety, chaſtity, charity, and all other epiſcopal virtues; for as he taught, ſo he lived, was idle at no time, nor did he admit any of his retinue to be ſo, but kept them in a continual exerciſe, either reading ſcripture or learning the pſalms of David by heart. If he was invited to any feaſt (as rarely he went) he made no ſtay, but after a little refreſhment taken, got himſelf away. In preaching he was moſt diligent, travelling through the country, for the greater part on foot, and inſtructing the people where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came. In a word, he was deficient in no duty required of a good Paſtor; and having governed the church in thoſe parts moſt happily the ſpace of 17 years, he died in the <hi>Iſle of Lindisfarne,</hi> the place he chuſed for his reſidence, where he was alſo buried.</p>
                        <p>After his death, which happened in the year 651, <hi>Finianus</hi> was ordained Biſhop, and ſent to the Northumbers, from Scotland.</p>

                     </note> Bede's remarks on the ſucceſſion of Scotch Biſhops ending in <hi>Tuda,</hi> are too honourable to be omitted obſervation here.

Their poſſeſſions conſiſted chiefly in cattle, for money was no longer retained than till a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offered to diſtribute it to the poor. Places of entertainment for Potentates and Princes were unneceſſary, for they were viſited only for their doctrines and the holy offices of the church. The King himſelf, when he came thither from his royal reſidence, had no other object in view than to partake of the rites of religion, and departed immediately after the ſervice: if perchance he took refreſhment, it was of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fare of the Monks. The attention of theſe Paſtors was on ſpiritual matters only; temporal affairs were deemed derogatory of their holy appointment; and thence aroſe the high veneration which was paid by all ranks of people to the religious habit. When any Eccleſiaſtic went from his monaſtery, it was to preach the word of ſalvation, and he was every where received with joy, as a meſſenger of the Divinity: on the road, the paſſengers bowed the head to receive the ſign of the croſs and his benediction, with pious reverence noting his precepts, as documents of the moſt ſalutary purport: the churches were crowded with a devout

audience, and when a Monk was ſeen entering a village on his travels, the inhabitants flocked about him, entreating for his admonitions and prayers. On their viſitations, riches and donations were not their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; when a religious ſociety received any augmentation of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the houſe, it was through compaſſion by the donor, and they accepted it as an additional ſtore with which they were entruſted for the benefit of the poor.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0085300202:125"/>
he won upon the ear of <hi>Etheldred,</hi> and gained from him the Biſhopric of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> Adverſity is ſaid to be the ſchool of wiſdom, but it proved not ſo with <hi>Wilfred;</hi> for in this new inſtitution he conducted himſelf with that inſolence and impropriety, that he ſoon incurred the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Mercian King and the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, who brought him to trial before a ſynod, and depoſed him. He was now 70 years of age, and yet his powers were ſo little debilitated, and his paſſions remained ſo warm, that he again journeyed to Rome, and in ſpite of the character of a turbulent and contentious Prelate, which he carried with him, obtained a decree for his reſtoration. He returned a ſecond time with the powers of Rome in his favour, and at a more favourable ſeaſon to obtain the rewards of his labour.

                        <p>St. Cuthbert, as it is generally agreed, was born of mean parents, though ſome make him deſcended from the blood royal of Ireland; but the firſt ſeems the moſt probable, as he followed the occupation of a ſhepherd.</p>
                        <p>Once upon a time when the ſaint was preaching in a certain village to a crowded audience, the alarm was given that there was one of the cottages on fire, this drew a number of people from the ſermon to extinguiſh it, which was juſt what ſatan propoſed; the more water they threw on it, the more fiercely it ſeemed to burn, and all efforts to put it out ſeemed inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. The ſaint miſſing ſo many of his auditors, enquired the cauſe, when leaving off his preaching and repairing to the ſcene of action, he perceived it was all illuſion, and ordered a few drops of holy water to be ſprinkled on it; on which the devil ſneaked off, and the fire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared.</p>

                        <p>"At which tyme I finde, that <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> was a ſhepheard, and that in the dead of the night, he ſaw the ſoule of the ſaid Biſhop carryed up with great melody by a quire of angells into heaven; which heavenly viſion ſoe ſeaz'd upon his affection, that reſolving upon an holyer courſe of life, he thought he could betake himſelf to noe better place then to the abby of <hi>Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,</hi> built by <hi>Aidanus</hi> upon the banks of <hi>Tweed;</hi> but the devill to croſſe his good intent, meetes him in his journey, and after a good cudgeling, was glad to leave him; for proof whereof, in the ſame place to this day (if you will borrowe an optick-glaſs from ſuperſtition) you may ſee the printe of his cloven foote: Neither did his valour, but alſo his humulitie appeare, when overtaken by night and hunger, he was forc'd to ſuccour himſelfe under an old cottage, where he found noe other gueſt for entertainment, then an horſe, which turning up the hay, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a loafe of bread, at which the Saint right glad, ſaid grace, and giving the horſe one halfe, ſatisfied himſelfe with the other, and the next day came to <hi>Mailroſe,</hi> where he had no ſooner entred, but <hi>Boyſilus</hi> Prior of the abby, by a propheticall phiſiognomy, as if he had read in his face his ſanctite, ſolemnly receives him in his armes, and preſents him to <hi>Eata</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, who committed him to <hi>Boyſilus</hi> for his tutor, who taught him <hi>St. John's</hi> goſpell, in that booke, which in honour of the ſchollar, was kept in the abby at Durham in Prior <hi>Turgots</hi> tyme, on which, after ſoe many centuries of yeares, noe moth durſt ever preſume to feede.</p>
                        <p>"In this abby, after he had ſpent in the perfection of a monaſticall life 15 yeares, he was prefer'd by <hi>Eata</hi> the Biſhop, to the Priorie of <hi>Lindisfarne.</hi> In this <hi>Holy Iſland</hi> (ſo chriſtned in after ages for <hi>St. Cuthbert's</hi> ſanctitie) ſtood that renouned monaſtery founded by <hi>K. Oſwald,</hi> and was the mother church and nurcery of religion among the <hi>Bernicians</hi> under <hi>Aidanus,</hi> from whom the epiſcopall race of the Prelates of the church of <hi>Durham</hi> reckon their ſucceſſion.</p>
                        <p>"In this iſland <hi>fourteen</hi> Biſhops ſucceſſively aſcended the epiſcopall ſeate; among whom, as a glorious ſtarre of the firſt magnitude, <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> ſhyned in the firmament of this church; where after twelve yeares he had borne the dignity of the Priorſhip, he became a votary to an anachoreticall life, and chooſed the iſland <hi>Farne,</hi> ſeated in the maine ocean, for the place of his hermytage. This iſland as voyd of trees, water, and graine, as full of devills, became the ſtage whereon <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> acted all his miracles; for at his arrival, the ſpirits that frequented this iſle were put to ſlight, the rocks powred out their water, and as if there had beene a return of the golden age, the earth brought forth corne without tillage, with many more wonders, if they might bee reported upon the creditt of a legend: but theſe are enough to ſhewe what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0085300202:128"/>the Monkes took of the blind devotion of that age, whoſe ſtudy and whole practiſe was to deviſe and relate miracles of their Saints, which (as ſuperſtition is alwaies credulous) were as eaſily beleeved: Thus to gaine from the <hi>Pagans</hi> a reverend opinion of chriſtianity, they thought it but a pious fraud to coſen the people with volumes of wonders, who whiles they defended trueth by forgeries, their impoſtures diſcover'd to wiſer ages, have rather made reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſuſpected, then any way advanced it: but if I ſhould proceed in this diſcourſe, I ſhould leave <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> too ſolitarie in his cell at <hi>Farne,</hi> where for want of other auditors, I finde him in the hiſtory preaching to birds that eate his corne, who ſoe confuted them out of the text, with <hi>aliena non concupiſces,</hi> that they never after touch'd his harveſt. In like manner he reclaymed two crowes from their wonted ſtealing and rapine, that pull'd thatch of his ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for to build their neſts, and made them ſo penitent, that they lay proſtrate at his feete for abſolution.</p>
                        <p>"In this iſle he voluntarilye ſuffer'd nine yeares impriſonment from the ſociety of men, ſoe wholly devoted to heaven, that he remembred not he was upon earth, and for a whole yeare forgott to put off his ſhoes: but he could not live ſoe obſcurely in his cell, as his ſame was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent abroad; and in a ſynod at <hi>Alne upon Twyſord</hi> he was in his abſence choſen Biſhop: This dignity was propheſied to him long before whiles he was a child, by an infant of three yeares old, who gravely reproved him, <hi>Fye Saint Cuthbert! what a Presbyter and a Biſhop, and playing among boyes?</hi> as if at that tyme he had ſeene him in his myter and croſier ſtaffe; but <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> had ſo wedded his affection to a ſolitary life, that neither letters nor embaſſadors from the ſynod could perſwade or command him to take upon him the government of the church, till King <hi>Egfrid</hi> himſelfe, attended with both the Lords temporall and ſpirituall, ſayled to his hermytage, and with the ſame company might have beſieged and taken a city whiles they were conquering his reſolution.</p>
                        <p>"The King to enlarge his dioceſſe gave him a great part of the city of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the village of <hi>Creca</hi> with three miles compaſſe about it, as alſo the cittie of <hi>Carliel</hi> with the circuit of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles about it: but for all this, <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> mind was ſtill on his anchorage, whither ſhortly he betooke himſelfe againe, and in contempt of honour, edded his life in his cell. But it ſhall be no part of his funerall prayſes thus to unman himſelfe to contemplate himſelfe into a God or <hi>Silvanus,</hi> for what was this elſe then to excommunicate himſelfe from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and to finne againſt the definition of a man, to whom ſocietie is as naturall, as to bee a creature: and ſurely religion cannot bee the motive of ſuch an unnaturall act, but rather in all ſuch anchorites a melancholy diſtemper is uſually miſtaken for devotion.</p>
                        <p>"His laſt will and teſtament was to his Monkes to bury him at the eaſt ſide of his oratory, in a coffin that venerable <hi>Cudda</hi> the Abbat gave him, which they ſhould finde hid in the ground at the north ſide of his cell, and to putt his corps in the ſhirt that <hi>Verca</hi> Abbateſſe of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> had ſent him for a token (which for the reverence of that holy woman he had never worn in his life time,) and laſtly, if the <hi>Pagans</hi> ſhould invade them, and force them to flye, that they ſhould carry with them his bones: All theſe deſires were performed; onely at the weeping re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Monkes, he permitted that his body ſhould bee tranſported to <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> where in <hi>St. Peters</hi> church, at the right ſide of the high altar, he was ſolemnly enſhrined anno domini 687.</p>
                        <p>"But to returne to <hi>Saint Cuthbert,</hi> who had now an eleven yeares lyen in his ſepulchre, when the Monkes thought to place his bones, by this time drye and diſrobed of fleſh, among their other reliques, for kiſſes and adoration: but behold a wonder! They looke for a ſkeleton, but found an entire body, with joints flexible, and fleſh ſo ſucculent, that there onely wanted heate to make his body live without a ſoule; nay his very funerall weedes were ſo freſh, as if putrefaction had not dared to pluck him by the coate. This was rather to pay his debt to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then to nature; who after he had reſtored his ſoule to God, ſhould keepe back the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0085300202:129"/>of his body from corruption. In other men it is true, that ſleepe is the image of death, but here the grave ſuffer'd a cheat, and death was the image of ſleepe.</p>
                        <p>"This miracle <hi>St. Beda</hi> reports (who was an eleven yeares old at <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> death) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating whereof he made no lye, but perhaps told one. The hiſtory of whoſe life and death, he writ from the information of the Monkes of <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> who had defloured all the miracles of Saints in holy writt, and beſtowed them upon their <hi>St. Cuthbert;</hi> who, like man in paradiſe, had the beaſts to doe him homage, and the ſea monſters to aſke him bleſſing: Like <hi>Abraham</hi> he entertayned three angells at the monaſterie of <hi>Rippon:</hi> A raven brought <hi>Elias</hi> fleſh, and an eagle brought <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> fiſh. As he ſayl'd with his mother from <hi>Ireland,</hi> his native ſoyl, into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he lett the book of Pſalmes fall into the ſea, which forthwith was ſwallowed up of a ſea calfe, and by the ſame fiſh delivered to them at their landing. Take here the pſalter for a man, and the ſea calfe for a whale, and you have the hiſtory of <hi>Ionas,</hi> with many ſuch hiſtories of wonder, with which the Monkes delighted the ſuperſtition of the times.</p>
                        <p>"After this illuſtrious miracle of <hi>St. Cuthbert's</hi> incorruption, <hi>Lindisfarne</hi> rais'd itſelfe to that height of renowne, that <hi>Ceolwolphus</hi> the King, to whom <hi>Bede</hi> dedicates his Engliſh Hiſtorie, reſigned an earthly crowne to gaine a celeſtiall one, and tooke upon him the habitt of a Monke in <hi>Lindisfarne;</hi> a welcome man you may be ſure to that monaſtery, for whoſe ſake, it was graunted the Monkes there to drinke wine or ale, who before were onely to drinke milke or water, though they that dranke after <hi>Saint Cuthbert</hi> in his cupp, found ſometimes water turn'd into wyne without a miracle.</p>
                        <p>"Many kingly treaſures did this devout Prince beſtowe upon that monaſtery, with ſuch large poſſeſſions, as he ſeem'd rather to reſigne his kingdome to the church than to his ſucceſſour, and became a Monke to make <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> a King: for he endowed that monaſtery with all the land betweene the rivers of <hi>Tees</hi> and <hi>Weer,</hi> and many townes and lordſhips, as <hi>Warkworth Caſtle, Billingham, Gedworth,</hi> (where <hi>Ceolwolphus</hi> built the church,) and diverſe other villages, as <hi>Woodceſtre, Hutingham, Breſgen, Edulingham,</hi> names that for ought I know, have outlived their townes, or townes that have chang'd their names.</p>
                        <p>"After the manifeſtation of this miracle of bodily immortality after death. <hi>Eadfrid</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, cauſed him to be lay'd in a new ſepulchre, and to be advanced for ſtate and reverence above the pavement in the ſanctuary, for it was not fitt that he ſhould have his grave among the dead, whoſe body lived by ſanctity when his ſoule was gone.</p>
                        <p>"Now they began to worſhip the very ground <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> had troad upon, whoſe ſanctity was ſuch, that he made every place he came in a church; and <hi>Eadfrid</hi> in honour of <hi>St. Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> preſence, there built up his hermitage; where, as if a genius of ſanctity had frequented that place, <hi>Ethelwald</hi> a Monke of <hi>Rippon</hi> lived an Hermite twelve yeares.</p>
                        <p>"Thus for a long tyme flouriſhed the Monkes of that church in great repute and proſperity, till the <hi>Danes</hi> diſturbed their peace, who now began to make incurſions upon the frontiers of this land, for many yeares continueing their piracies, till they had made a final conqueſt, which at length yeilded to the <hi>Norman</hi> ſword. Thoſe were the tymes, when ſo many monaſteries (which the devotion of former ages had erected) had their funerals: then periſhed that famous Emporium of <hi>Hartlepoole,</hi> where the religious <hi>Hieu</hi> built a nunnery, of which I may ſpeake as <hi>Hildebert</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                           <q>Quam magna fueras integra, fracta doces;</q>
whoſe ruines ſhew how great ſhee was in her glory, but now remayns to paſſengers both a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of devotion and hoſtility: then were demoliſhed the two monaſteries of <hi>St. Peter</hi> and <hi>St. Paul</hi> at <hi>Weremouth</hi> and <hi>Jarrow,</hi> built by the reverend Abbats <hi>Celfrid</hi> and <hi>Benedict.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"The furie of the <hi>Danes</hi> ſtill encreaſing, continued by the ſea coſtes to <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> ſo that it was now tyme for the Monkes of <hi>Lindisfarne</hi> to look about them; for they well underſtood by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0085300202:130"/>the lamentable uſage of their neighbouring abbyes that the <hi>Danes</hi> would not, like the devill, bee affrighted with holy water, and ſaw by the bad ſucceſſe of other monaſteries, that it was not ſafe truſting to the protection of a Saint, and ſo concluding upon flight, putting all their reliques into <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> coffin, they left the <hi>Pagans</hi> the ſpoyle of an empty church, anno Domini 893.</p>
                        <p>"It was <hi>Eardulphus</hi> his fortune to bee Biſhop in theſe troubleſome tymes, who with his whole Cleargy and families of People, followed this ſacred bier; which, beſides ſeaven Monkes, as deputed Eſquires of his body, none durſt preſume to touch. Theſe miſeries had beene enough to have unfainted <hi>St Cuthbert,</hi> when purſued both by forreine foes, and overtaken with an home-bred enemy, famyne, he could afford them no releife.

But they had not farre ſail'd from the ſhore, but the winds and the ſea were both up in armes againſt their ſhippe, which both <hi>Aeolus</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> might have reverenced for her ſacred car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage of a Biſhop and his Clergy: but the ſea roared ſoe loud, that noe prayers for <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> could bee heard, but threaten'd them ſo near with ſhipwracke, as they had not that confidence in their Saint, as to encourage the marriners as Caeſar did, <hi>Ne metues, Cuthbertum vehis!</hi> who now himſelf wanted ſome other Saint to invocate for helpe, and was in daunger to bee drowned after he was dead. Where had then beene the <hi>church of Durham,</hi> and the devotion of Kings to his ſepulchur? Where had then beene the <hi>tutelarie Deity</hi> againſt the <hi>Scotts,</hi> and the lande of the church called <hi>St. Cuthberts patrimony?</hi> How then ſhould his <hi>halywarke-folk</hi> be freed from tribute and ſervice in warre, and the Monkes of Durham fed ſoe many yeares with eaſe and fatt revenues, if now their Saint had beene entombed in the ſea, and erected his epiſcopal ſeate among the fiſhes? This ſacrilegious ſtorme ſtrucke this ſhippe with ſuch a palſie, that it ſhak't out the texts of the Evangeliſts into the ſea: This book <hi>Eadfrid</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lindisfarne</hi> had writ out with his own hand, and <hi>Belfrid</hi> the Anchorite had curiouſly paynted and guilded it, in which art the Monkes were admirably expert; not that I taxe in them this quality, but onely, it argued the Monkes were at great leaſure. Thus, whether the ſea, as envying the land ſuch a precious jewell as <hi>St. Cuthbert,</hi> or he himſelf to ſhew his diſlike for <hi>Ireland,</hi> had raiſed this ſtorme, it was not long 'till in a calme they were carryed to the ſhore from whence they ſett forth: but great ſorrow you muſt imagine was for the drowned booke, 'till one <hi>Hundredus</hi> (one of the ſeven that carryed the coffyn) was bid in a night viſion by <hi>St. Cuthbert,</hi> to goe ſeeke it on the ſhoare at <hi>Whitterne,</hi> where he found it in its former beautie and ſplendour, which was kept in <hi>Prior Turgots</hi> tyme in Durham, in memory of the miracle; when the water ſeem'd to run out of herſelfe to doe homage to <hi>St. Cuthbert,</hi> and would rather looſe her nature then wett his book. If this were true, then I am ſure that <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> bookes had twice bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune in the ſea, then they have now in his library at Durham, which was once a little vatican of choyce manuſcripts, but now rather a <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>"But to returne to the forenamed Monkes, who had another oracle by night from <hi>St. Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to repair to a certaine tree, whereon he ſhould finde a bridle, at the ſight whereof, a dunne horſe ſhould proffer his ſervice (for eaſe of the Monkes) to drawe <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> body lay'd upon a wagon: but this was not to ſteale an horſe, becauſe it was an horſe of <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi>
                           <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0085300202:131"/>providing, the conduct whereof (as if he underſtood more of <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> minde than the reſt) they followed whither ſoever he drew him, and at length, by the providence of the horſe, they came to the monaſtery of <hi>Creca,</hi> where for foure moneths they were kindly entertayned by the Abbat and his Covent, and had leaſure to tell ſtoryes of their travailes.</p>
                        <p>"From this abby, in a revelation by night, <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> ſent <hi>Aeadred</hi> Abbat of <hi>Luell,</hi> upon an embaſſage to the campe of the <hi>Danes,</hi> that they ſhould crowne <hi>Guthredus</hi> King, whom they had ſold to a widdow; a thing in thoſe days not practiced by the Pope to diſpoſe of kingdomes. But what authority he had to nominate a King, or what reaſon they had to believe a dreame, muſt be rank'd amongſt <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> miracles: for <hi>Guthred</hi> thus to bee made a King, what was it elſe then to become <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> ſubject, and to oblige his royalty to thoſe Monkes that as boldly encroacht upon ſoe fayre an advantage? For firſt, they require the reſtauration of their epiſcopal ſeat in <hi>Cuncaceſtre,</hi> where <hi>Eardulphus</hi> firſt aſcended the pontifical chayre. And it was but another dreame, for the foreſayd Abbot to goe to the King from <hi>St. Cuthbert,</hi> and bid him give all the lands betwixt <hi>Weer</hi> and <hi>Tyne</hi> for ever to his church. This modeſt requeſt muſt bee graunted, or elſe the Monkes would be ready to upbrayd him with ingratitude. Ah poor Prince! to bee thus rob'd of his kingdome, and to receive a diademe, to ſet it upon <hi>St. Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> head! Thus was the religious King cheated of his ſoveraignty by thoſe Monkes that had now got the art of anſlaving the devotion of Princes to their private ends; for at this tyme alſo, the great <hi>Alfred</hi> ſwore fealty to <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> and his Clergy, by whoſe help they perſwaded him, that he had got the victory over the <hi>Pagans.</hi> This made them bold alſo to aſk the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a ſanctuary for their church, to reſkue offenders 37 dayes at <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> ſepulchre, that neither Juſtice ſhould curbe the freedome of ſinning, either againſt heaven or the ſtate; for noe other uſe was commonly made of aſylums, than, that men might offend more ſecurely, and diſloyally appeal from the King and the Lawes to the protection of a Saint. Neither was this enough, 'till King <hi>Alfred</hi> muſt by his royal charter free the inhabitants of <hi>St. Cuthberts</hi> lande from tribute to the King, which he ſealed with fearful anathem's to his ſucceſſors, that ſhould infringe the ſaid liberties. What elſe was this, than for a King to bee a Traitour to his own Majeſty, and deprive himſelf of that ſervice, which even by the law of nature is due from a Subject to his Prince.</p>
                        <p>"Now in what reverend eſteem this Saint was to King <hi>Alfred,</hi> I gather from the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the chappel to <hi>St Cuthbert</hi> in <hi>Univerſity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he is ſaid to bee the firſt founder: in an antient window whereof <hi>King Alfred</hi> and <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> are painted together, the King beſpeaking the Saint in a pentameter,
<q>Hic in honore tui Collegium ſtatui;</q>
and <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi> thus replying in an hexameter,
<q>Quod ſtatuiſti in eo, pervertentes maledico;</q>
and by ſuch curſes, the Monks maintayn'd their lands in a better tenure than under the Kings broad ſeale. The like malediction you may read in a diſtick in <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in wooden letters over the ſcreene,

                  <p>This life of ſeverity excited the reverence and admiration of thoſe ages of ignorance. Whether enthuſiaſm alone could determine the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind to ſuch undertakings, or there was a degree of pride mixed in the influenza, I cannnot determine. The vices of thoſe times, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, were not attended with ſuch degrees of deſpair as are unknown to us; the inducements muſt have been more complicated than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward countenance of piety expreſſed. How different the manners of the religious of the ſame church in modern times. <q>An ambitious or hypocritical religious, who makes a profeſſion of humility, whilſt he is puffed up with pride; a man meanly clad, and who only ſeeks after riches; a pretender to devotion, who gives himſelf out as a ſervant of God, while he is no more than a ſlave to his paſſions, is a monſter both in church and ſtate.</q>—<q>Every intriguing Monk or Friar, who thruſts himſelf into families, for the purpoſe of prying into ſecrets, regulating marriages or wills, is as deſpicable as he is dangerous.</q>— Theſe are the liberal ſentiments of the immortal Ganganelli, Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment XIV. whoſe works have placed the Romiſh church in a more amiable point of view, than it has appeared in ſeveral paſt ages.</p>

Hiſt. of Religion, vol. 2. p. 469.</note> adopts to account for the auſterities of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious men. <q>Nor is it ſatisfactory to ſay, that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of ſuperſtition; and is therefore rejected. For, not to mention the exceſſive pennances of the <hi>Bach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s and <hi>Talaponis;</hi> it is certain, that the <hi>Rhamadan</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> during which the poor wretches, for many days, often in the hotteſt months of the year, and in ſome of the hotteſt climates in the world, remain without eating or drinking from the riſing to the ſetting ſun; this <hi>Rhamadan,</hi> I ſay, muſt be more ſevere than the practice of any moral duty, even to the moſt vicious and depraved of mankind. The four Lents of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and the auſteries of ſome <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> appear more diſagreeable than <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>benevolence.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Perhaps, the following account may be received as a true ſolution of the difficulty. The duties which a man performs as a friend or parent, ſeem meerly owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be wanting to theſe duties, without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality. A ſtrong inclination may prompt him to the performance: a ſentiment of order and moral obligation joins its force to theſe natural ties: and the whole man is truly virtuous, is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavour. Even with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the virtues, which are more auſtere, and more founded on reflection, ſuch as public ſpirit, filial duty, temperance, or integrity; the moral obligation, in our apprehenſion, remove all pretenſion to religious merit; and the virtuous conduct is deemed no more, than what we owe to ſociety and to ourſelves. In all this, a ſuperſtitious man finds nothing, which he has properly performed for the ſake of his Deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and protection. He conſiders not, that the moſt genuine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſerving the Divinity, is by promoting the happineſs of his creatures. He ſtill looks out for ſome more immediate ſervice of the Supreme Being, in order to allay thoſe terrors, with which he is haunted. And any practice, recommended to him, which either ſerves to no purpoſe in life, or offers the ſtrongeſt violence to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations; that practice he will the more readily embrace, on account of thoſe very circumſtances, which ſhould make him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely reject it. It ſeems the more purely religious, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0085300202:136"/>
from no mixture of any other motive or conſideration. And if, for its ſake, he ſacrifices much of his eaſe and quiet, his claim of merit appears ſtill to riſe upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he diſcovers. In reſtoring a loan, or paying a debt, his Divinity is in no wiſe beholden to him; becauſe theſe acts of juſtice are what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no God in the univerſe. But if he faſt a a day, or give himſelf a ſound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion, to the ſervice of God. No other motive could engage him to ſuch auſterities. By theſe diſtinguiſhed marks of devotion, he has now acquired the divine favour; and may expect, in recompence, protection and ſafety in this world, and eternal happineſs in the next.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I will quit this review, to return to the more intereſting features of <hi>Friendſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we compare <hi>Friendſhip</hi> to the other affections of man, we ſee <hi>Love</hi> has a powerful influence on the human heart; but its bounds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and its concluſions ſelfiſh; it has but one object to poſſeſs: its attachments are rigorous indeed, but full of prejudice; and its whole influence centers in an <hi>Egoity,</hi> wherein generoſity and honour loſe much of their luſtre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gratitude</hi> is an excellent operation of the ſoul; our obligations are therein duly eſtimated: it is a confeſſion of our former indigence; and ſelf-importance is refined by ſuch humiliation: it depends on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon which is drawn, between our own wants and the bounty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. <hi>Gratitude</hi> is a branch of <hi>moral honeſty,</hi> a confeſſion of <hi>the debt of obligation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is abundantly ſuperior to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude;</hi> it is an affection of the heart, in which <hi>Benevolence</hi> preſides: it is accompanied by an openneſs of mind, wherein <hi>Generoſity</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> are exemplary, without ſelfiſhneſs, or price, or conſideration of reward. In <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> the boſom is expanded and elated; ſecrecy, guile, and concealment are expelled; and probity, truth, and virtue reign in their place. There is an energy in <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> to which every faculty contributes: it fires the ſoul with fervour, and fills the heart with gladneſs. You act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, from the ſame principles, as would conduct your own neareſt and moſt momentous affairs: it is that <hi>divine perfection,</hi> to which we are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0085300202:137"/>
peculiarly exhorted: <hi>Love your neighbour as yourſelf.</hi> With our friend all diſguiſe is thrown off; the political guiſe of politeneſs, which maſks ſincerity, is taken away; the heart leaps with affection; the eyes gaze with rapture, approbation, and eſteem; the countenance glows with expreſſions of delight; the boſom is unlocked, the treaſures of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom are thrown abroad; you fear no treachery, you are open and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident; you communicate with the ſame joy you receive inſtruction, and all is pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Such were the feelings my youth experienced in the poſſeſſion of a friend. How often hath the young mind hung enraptured in the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of my friend. The cordiality that then took place was as dear as life. Riper manhood hath retained the whole, though in a graver degree.</p>
                  <p>I think I hear the Saint reply, <q>the warmth of our ſociability freezes up with declining youth, our cordiality cools as age advances, and our openneſs of heart decreaſes, as the frauds of mankind, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments of life, advance upon experience: we grow afraid of the hidden dangers our confidence hath often prompted; and we gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually treaſure up in our memories, the leſſons of example, and the inferences of experience; which, like the ſepulchres of the dead, only remind us how many friends are departed, how many diſaſters are incident to life, how little dependence there is on man, and how vain is all human confidence in the things of this world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ſuch is the conſequence of age; if the delightful taſte of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> paſſeth away; I will cling to the departing footſteps, I will graſp at the ſacred verge, from whence to fall, is to depart from the firſt, and the fineſt enjoyment of human life; the only poſſeſſion on earth, which gives an idea of the communion of angels.</p>

The religious ſociety of this houſe conſiſted of Monks and Nuns,<note n="†" place="bottom">This aſſociation of Monks and Nuns is ſaid to be grounded on the words of our Saviour, John xix. 26, 27.</note> who occupied ſeparate parts of the edifice; but the ſeverities of a devoted life, and the ſtrict rules profeſſed in ſuch ſocieties, were not ſufficient to prevent a ſhameful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of diſcipline, and many groſs abuſes and enormities took place; inſomuch, that the deſtruction of this ſtately edifice was regarded as a judgment, for the crimes and pollutions of its inhabitants. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of <hi>Lindisfarn</hi> looked upon the event with religious horror, and ſoon after <hi>Cuthbert</hi> was made Biſhop, he forbid the approach of women to the convent, and even denied them acceſs to the church where the Monks performed their devotions: he cauſed a ſmall chapel to be erected in a diſtant plain on the iſland for the reception of the female ſex, from its ſituation taking the name of Greenchurch. From thenceforth the women were excluded the churches or cemeteries where St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s body reſted; and ſome miraculous puniſhments are related which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infringements on this injunction. In the cathedral church at Durham the pavement is diſtinguiſhed by a croſs of black marble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which women were not allowed to advance towards the choir.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cuthbert</hi> enjoyed his change of life and dignities but a very ſhort time, for within two years finding his health declining, and his mind being by habit tempered more for ſolitude and ſilence than the duties of this high office, he reſigned the See, and returned to his cell in <hi>Farne,</hi>

where he ſurvived only two months, yielding his ſpirit to God on the 20th day of May, 687, in the 53d year of the creation of the See of <hi>Lindisfarn,</hi> and 37 years after he had aſſumed the monaſtic habit at <hi>Mailroſs.</hi>

Theſe directions were none of them performed, his body was tranſported to Lindisfarn, where in St. Peter's church, at the right ſide of the high altar, he was ſolemnly laid in a tomb of ſtone; but the Monks left behind them the coffin for which he expreſſed ſuch regard, which ſtill continues to be ſhewn at Farne Iſland, and it is highly probable they were not more mindful of the ſheet</p>

                        <p>In the Philoſophical Tranſactions a curious painting of St. Cuthbert is deſcribed, found neer Aſhelney, in Somerſetſhire. The portrait is enamelled on gold, drawn ſitting in an epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal chair, with the following inſcription:
<q>AELFRED MEL HETT GEWYRLAN.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus conſtrued: Alfredus me juſſit fabricari.</p>
                        <p>Mr Wallis ſpeaking of this portrait, has the following remarks. <q>King Alfred preferred theſe characters to the Saxon, and when he ſwayed the ſcepter, brought them in uſe. This curious memorial of St. Cuthbert was found in the very place of that glorious Monarch's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and deliverance from the Danes, fortified by him in the time of war, and in time of peace converted into a monaſtery. Dr. Muſgrave thinks this curious <hi>Cimolium</hi> an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtance of the uſe of images coming from the heathens into the chriſtian church.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. Cuthbert's ſhrine had the privilege of ſanctuary, where fugitives were ſafe for 37 days. This reſpite allowed criminals a time for making reſtitution, or under the feudal laws they would have ſuffered immediate pains and puniſhments: it was the proceſs by which the rigour of common law was moderated; and when kept in due reſtraint was of great benefit to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: but by an enormous extenſion which took place, it produced infinite miſchiefs to the community and to the ſtate.</p>

happened in the 17th year of the reign of <hi>Osbert</hi> King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland.</hi> By ſome authors it is aſcribed to the reſentment of <hi>Bruern Brocard,</hi> a Northumbrian Nobleman. <hi>King Osbert</hi> having come to <hi>Bruern</hi>'s caſtle in his abſence, was moſt courteouſly received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by his Lady, of whom he became enamoured; and in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all the principles of humanity, hoſpitality, and juſtice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained her to receive his embraces. <hi>Bruern</hi> on his return being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the irreparable injury and diſgrace he had ſuſtained by this royal rape, went to court, attended by his kindred and dependents, and ſolemnly renounced his allegiance, and the lands he held of the King: then taking his paſſage immediately to <hi>Denmark,</hi> he fell at the feet of <hi>King Guthred,</hi> to whom <hi>Bruern</hi> was related, deſcribing his injury in ſuch pathetic terms, and uttering his grief with that energy, that the Daniſh Monarch readily hearkened to his requeſts, fitting out a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fleet and great army for the coaſts of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> under two Generals who were brothers, <hi>Inguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba.</hi> Matthew of Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſays, the principle view of this Daniſh expedition, was againſt the dominions of Edmund King of the Eaſt Angles, who was falſly charged with putting to death the father of the Daniſh chieftains, who had been aſſaſſinated by an exiled traitor. They had propoſed to land, this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays, on the coaſts of Edmund's kingdom, but by contrary winds being driven northwards, they landed at <hi>Berwick upon Tweed.</hi> The convent of <hi>Coldingham</hi> having been reſtored after a former conflagration, was then poſſeſſed, it is ſaid, by Nuns, under an Abbeſs called <hi>Ebba,</hi> of royal blood. She dreading the barbarities theſe invaders exerciſed in their former deſcent, on all ranks of religious, in an aſſembly of her Nuns repreſenting the hazard their chaſtity was in, communicated a device which ſhe preſumed would preſerve them from theſe violators. Without heſitation they vowed that her rules ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved. Forthwith ſhe drew out a razor, and as an example, with the greateſt fortitude, cut off her noſe and upper lip: ſhe was followed by the whole ſiſterhood. When the <hi>Danes</hi> entered the convent in the morning, they were ſhocked with the horrid ſpectacle, and diſappointed in their luſts, ſet fire to the edifice, wherein the Abbeſs with all her whole convent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0085300202:149"/>
were conſumed.<note n="*" place="bottom">There is the greateſt improbability in this relation, touching the maſſacre of Ebba and her Nuns. In the time of Ebba who was of royal race, the ſociety conſiſted of Monks and Nuns; and ſhe was dead before St. Cuthbert was conſecrated Biſhop of Lindisfarn, and made the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation noted in regard to the female ſex.—The reader will correct the note at p. 120. If the name of the Abbeſs of Coldingham, at the time of this deſcent of the Danes, was Ebba, it could not be Ebba daughter of Edilfrid King of Northumberland.</note> This is the ſtory of Matthew of Weſtminſter; but other authors,<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. Sym. Dunelm. &amp;c.</note> whoſe relations are attended with greater probability, fix the place of this Daniſh deſcent at the mouth of the Humber, from whence the invaders marched to <hi>York. Osbert</hi> at their approach led forth a powerful army, and engaged them near the city, where he fell amongſt the ſlain, and his troops were totally routed. <hi>Aella,</hi> who had held a conflict of five years for the kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi> with <hi>Osbert,</hi> under the ſupport of <hi>Bruern</hi> and his allies, is ſaid upon the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh invaſion to have come to a compromiſe with <hi>Osbert,</hi> and joined with him againſt the common enemy; and that in the battle, he alſo fell with <hi>Osbert.</hi> This account gains greater credit than that of <hi>Bruern</hi>'s application to the <hi>Danes;</hi> and it ſeems moſt probable, the object of this invaſion was no other than rapine and plunder. The <hi>Danes</hi> after this victory, having laid waſte the country between <hi>York</hi> and the <hi>Tyne,</hi> made <hi>Egbert</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> north of Tyne, to hold his Crown as their dependent: Being afterwards employed in expeditions againſt the ſouthern parts of this iſland, the Northumbrians dethroned this vaſſal King, and gave the Crown to <hi>Ricſig.</hi> Not long after this the Daniſh King embarking his troops in ſome of the ſouthern counties, ſailed for the mouth of Tyne, and landed at the town of <hi>Tynemouth,</hi> where he wintered, it being too late in the year to attempt any thing againſt the Northumbrians. On the opening of the ſpring they began their ravages on this unfortunate country, and marked their progreſs with unequalled barbarities: <hi>Lindisfarn</hi> was the object of their peculiar wrath—the chriſtian religion their moſt inveterate averſion.<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                        <p>King <hi>Alfred</hi> for the firſt ſix years was greatly diſtreſſed by the Daniſh invaſions: he was at laſt reduced to the neceſſity of ſeeking his ſafety for a conſiderable time in an obſcure and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible retreat, among the Marſhes of Somerſetſhire.

After which he was raiſed by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> to the throne of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> as a dependent Prince, under the Saxon Monarchy. Whilſt <hi>Alfred</hi> endured great diſtreſs in his retreat, he was comforted by a viſion of this Saint, who promiſed him the ſucceſs he afterwards experienced: from hence <hi>Alfred</hi> was inſpired with great veneration for him.

                  <p>We continued upon the iſland ſo long, in reviewing theſe venerable remains, as almoſt to forget we had yet to viſit many ſcenes in this county, as worthy the obſervation of the Antiquarian and Traveller, as thoſe preſent to us: and we calculated our departure ſo ill, that the tide had begun to return, before we entered upon the ſands. We thought ourſelves ſecure indeed againſt all dangers, by having a Farmer from the neighbouring ſhore for our guide, who had brought over butter that morning for the inhabitants. The tide approached in a ſingular manner, not flowing forward in waves, but the water increaſed imperceptably, by oozing through the ſands. At firſt the paſſage ſeemed a tract of wet ſand, but preſently it became a ſhining plain of level water, unruffled by any influx, reflecting in the moſt beautiful manner the variegated landſkips of the adjoining ſhores. Our guide rode upon one of thoſe methodical beaſts, which keeps up an invariable motion with a kind of mechanical exactneſs, in ſpite of every approaching emergency. We expreſſed our anxiety at the increaſing waters, yet not daring to leave our guide, on account of the intercepting gullies, and the apprehenſion of quickſands, of the ſituation and nature of which we were totally ignorant. He was unaltered, except in his dialogue, which now was filled with the circumſtances of a late Traveller's death, who periſhed in the paſſage, wandering on the ſands till he could not extricate himſelf from the ſurrounding floods. This was no pleaſing narrative to us, who were now daſhing through the increaſing waters, up to our horſes girths; our guide's conſtancy of countenance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved mind affording us no very agreeable contemplation. I wiſh to prevent ſtrangers engaging in ſo diſagreeable a project, tho' ours was attended with no other circumſtances than anxiety and impatiency of mind; yet had we attempted to make this paſſage without a guide, it is impoſſible to determine what would have been our lot.</p>

               <p>whoſe venerable remains give the traveller an idea of the ſtate of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces and ſtrongholds, in the remoteſt aera of our <hi>Saxon anceſtors</hi> in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The ſcite of this fortreſs is on the crown of a high rock, trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in figure, one of the points projecting into the ſea. Many of the buildings ſtand on the very brink of the rocks, to the land ſide: the aſpect towards the ſea is very lofty, being near 150 perpendicular feet above the level of low water mark. Part of the moſt ancient fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the land ſide are broken and defaced, by the falling of the cliffs on which they were erected, the ſame conſiſting of a ſoft red ſtone, which periſhes much by the weather. On this ſide a circular tower remains, of very antique conſtruction, its baſe projecting in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tiers. Many of the other buildings appear to be the work of more modern ages, till you approach the gate-way, which is on the only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible part of the rock; it was defended by a deep ditch, cut through a narrow neck communicating with the main land, having a draw bridge: this lays to the ſouth-eaſt, and on the brink of the precipice above the ſea ſhore. The gate-way is ſtrengthened by a round tower on each ſide, from whence paſſing about 12 paces, which ſpace appears to have been formerly a covered way, you approach a ſecond and machicolated gate, of a much more modern order of building, having a port-culice. After you have paſſed the ſecond gate, on the left hand, on a lofty point of the rock, ſtands a very ancient round tower, of great ſtrength, commanding the paſs. Aſſailants having won this approach, entered upon a ſituation of imminent danger on a tremendous precipice, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to every kind of annoyance from the beſieged, who poſſeſſed the round tower. This part of the fortreſs wears the moſt ancient coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and challenges the Saxons for its origin. The ingenious Mr

Groſe ſays, <q>this is the ſpot where, according to the Monkiſh Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, ſtood the caſtle or palace of the Kings of Northumberland; built, as it ſaid, by King Ida, who began his reign A. D. 559. Part of the preſent ruins are by ſome ſuppoſed to be the remains of King Ida's work.</q>—<q>On the whole, though there was undoubtedly a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs or palace here in the Saxon times, and perhaps earlier, every part of the preſent buildings, ſeems to have been the work of the Normans.</q> On what circumſtances Mr Groſe grounds this general determination, I cannot diſcover: moſt of the northern Norman ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are of excellent maſonry; the buildings here are various in figure, materials, modes of arching, windows, baſes, and other parts. The round tower I have noted is different in all thoſe matters, from the greateſt part of the works; and it is to a common obſerver marked with much greater antiquity than the Keep or main tower, which I ſhall next deſcribe. It is impoſſible to prevent a diſagreement in opinion on ſubjects of this kind; where there is no certain rule to fix determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it muſt be the caſe: I pay the greateſt deference to Mr Groſe's judgment, but think he has paſſed this determination haſtily. The Keep or chief tower of this fortreſs is a lofty ſquare ſtructure, of the ſame model with many Norman fortreſſes founded in or near the time of the Conqueror; it ſtands on the crown of the rock, having an open area round it, but moſt extenſive towards the north and north-eaſt points. Mr Wallis ſays, that from the ſtile of the architecture of its baſe, being of the Doric order, it is believed to be of Roman work. He adds, <q>that it is well known the Saxons erected their caſtles when they could on Roman foundations, and gave them the name of Burg or Brough.</q> It is very probable the Romans held this part of the country, to be of ſingular importance to their navy; but that they built caſtles here, is not by any means admiſſible. They might erect ſmall towers, like thoſe whoſe remains appear on the wall of Severus, on places of ſpecial import. I do not doubt the Saxons would enter upon the Roman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, for the ſame reaſons the Normans after them made ſuch choice: the northern counties furniſh a multitude of inſtances that the Normans poſſeſſed themſelves of ſuch ſituations; but in thoſe places the Roman vallum and foſs only ſerved for outworks to the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtructures. The remains of the Roman ſtation are viſible at many of thoſe fortreſſes. In moſt of the places I have obſerved, the Roman works are retained as a platform or outward area, to the ſouth ſides of the caſtles. In the northern ſtations, of the largeſt ſize, there are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of caſtles. Whether the Saxons or Normans entered upon thoſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0085300202:161"/>
places, I do not preſume to determine. The ſcite of the Praetorium is to be traced in many, but without any other appearances, than of erections for domeſtic uſes, not ſhewing a ſufficient quantity of ruins, to give the leaſt idea of a decayed caſtle. Mr Groſe ſays, <q>ſome aſſert the Keep to have been a Roman ſtructure, for which ſuppoſition they give the following reaſons; its great ſimilarity to the Keep of Dover Caſtle, and the White Tower of London, both allowed to be Roman —the ſhape of its arches, which are either flat or ſemicircular—a Doric baſe round its bottom, and the great depth of its well, ſunk 75 feet, through a whinſtone rock.—The firſt of theſe is evidently founded on a miſtake, neither the White Tower nor the Keep of Dover Caſtle being Roman, but built ſince the conqueſt; the laſt in the time of King Henry II. proofs of which are to be met with in Dugdale's Monaſticon, the Textus Roffenſis, and divers other authentic records. Nor is the proof drawn from the ſhape of its arches more concluſive; ſemicircular and flat arches are found in almoſt every building erected before the time of King Henry II. and from the argument deduced from its Doric baſe, it is not at all wonderful or uncommon, to find the members of Graecian architecture employed in Norman buildings. One inſtance of this, among many, may be ſeen at the cathedral of Canterbury, where a maſſive column, placed in the under-croft, to ſupport ſome vaſt weight, has a rude ſort of Ionic capital. Beſides it is well known moſt of the architects of thoſe days learned their art at Rome, where they had the Graecian architecture continually before them; of which indeed the Saxon was only a debaſed kind. After the ſtupendous works carried on by our Norman anceſtors, it ſeems extraordinary, that the digging of the above-mentioned well ſhould appear ſo arduous an undertaking, as to be deemed poſſible to the Romans only. Beſides, in Beeſton Caſtle, Cheſhire, there is a well full as deep, cut through the ſolid rock: and that is univerſally known to be the work of the Normans.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The following remarks, extracted from the ſame work, will not be unacceptable to the reader: <q>The ſtones with which the Keep or great tower is built, are remarkably ſmall, and were taken from a quarry three miles diſtant. From their ſmallneſs it has been conjectured they were brought hither on the backs of men or horſes. The walls to the front are 11 feet thick, but the other three ſides are only nine. The original roof was placed no higher than the top of the ſecond ſtory. The reaſon for the ſide walls being carried ſo much higher
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0085300202:162"/>
than the roof, might be for the ſake of defence, or to command a more extenſive look-out, both towards the ſea and land. The tower was however afterwards covered at the top. Here were no chimneys, the only fire place in it was a grate in the middle of a large room, ſuppoſed to have been the guard room, where ſome ſtones in the middle of the floor are burned red. This floor was all of ſtone, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by arches. This room had a window in it near the top, three feet ſquare, intended to let out the ſmoke. All the other rooms were lighted by ſlits or chinks in the walls, ſix inches broad. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works are built of a very different ſtone from that of the Keep, being a coarſe free ſtone of an inferior quality, ill abiding the injuries of weather; taken from the rock itſelf. In all the principal rooms in the outworks there are chimneys, particularly in the kitchen, which meaſures 40 feet by 30 feet, where there are three very large ones, and four windows; over each window is a ſtone funnel, like a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney open at the top, intended as it is ſuppoſed to carry off the ſteam. In a narrow paſſage near the top of the Keep was found upwards of 50 iron heads of arrows, ruſted together into a maſs; the longeſt of them about 7½ inches. In December 1770, in ſinking the floor of the cellar, the draw well was accidentally found: its depth is 145 feet, cut through the ſolid rock, of which 75 feet is of hard whin-ſtone. In the ſummer of the year 1773, in throwing over the bank a prodigious quantity of ſand, the remains of the chapel were diſcovered, in length 100 feet. The chancel is now quite cleared, is 36 feet long and 20 feet broad; the eaſt end, according to the Saxon faſhion, ſemicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The altar, which has been likewiſe found, did not ſtand cloſe to the eaſt end, but in the center of the ſemicircle, with a walk about it, three feet broad, left for the Prieſt to carry the Hoſt in proceſſion. The font, richly carved, is alſo remaining.</q>

                  <hi>Penda</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> ſtill remaining a Pagan, breathed the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate hatred againſt the Chriſtians: having obtained a victory over <hi>King Oſwald</hi> in Shropſhire, in which he treated the royal captive with the moſt ſavage barbarity, like a whirlwind he ruſhed to the deſtruction of his country. In the year 642, having ravaged <hi>Northumberland</hi> as far as <hi>Bambrough,</hi> he laid ſiege to it, and not being able to take the place by ſtorm, attempted to burn it, by raiſing huge piles of wood againſt the walls, and ſetting them on fire; but when his machines were fully prepared, and his piles were burning, the wind ſuddenly changed, and blowing a ſtorm, the blazing faggots were carried into his camp, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0085300202:164"/>
made a great deſtruction, inſomuch that he was obliged to raiſe the ſiege. This deliverance was aſcribed, according to the ſuperſtition and bigotry of thoſe times, to the prayers of <hi>Aidan</hi> Biſhop of Lindisfarn, who for the ſake of greater retirement, and an uninterrupted devotion, was then reſident on the <hi>Farn Iſland,</hi> afterwards famous for the cell of <hi>St. Cuthbert.

               <p>After the death of <hi>Alfred,</hi> who had reigned over <hi>Northumberland</hi> near 20 years, the Crown was uſurped by <hi>Eardulph,</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Oſred, Alfred</hi>'s eldeſt ſon, then an infant of the age of eight years. As this act of <hi>Eardulph</hi>'s portended imminent peril to the young Prince, <hi>Brithrick,</hi> a zealous adherent to <hi>Alfred</hi> and his family, ſeized the caſtle of <hi>Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> where he placed <hi>Oſred.</hi> It was not long before the Uſurper laid ſiege to the place; but it was ſo well defended, as to baffle all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and his aſſaults were attended with a ſucceſſion of ill fortune. Whilſt <hi>Eardulph</hi> remained before the walls, the people in general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for <hi>Oſred,</hi> and having levied a conſiderable army, advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Uſurper, who being informed of this unexpected change in the ſentiments of the people, prepared to raiſe the ſiege and draw off his troops. <hi>Brithrick</hi> at this inſtant made a vigorous ſally, the adverſaries were thrown into confuſion and ſoon routed, <hi>Eardulph</hi> was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and immediately executed, and <hi>Oſred</hi> aſcended the throne of his anceſtors, to the great joy of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0085300202:165"/>This was the place of <hi>Alured</hi>'s retirement, when he fled from <hi>York,</hi> to avoid the dangers of civil commotion, having in the ninth year of his reign been deſerted by his family and nobles. He was deſcended of <hi>Ida,</hi> but through the miſery of thoſe times obliged to abdicate the throne of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and ſeek for ſafety under <hi>Cynoth</hi> King of the <hi>Picts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the reign of <hi>King Egbert</hi> this caſtle was the priſon of <hi>Cynewolf</hi> Biſhop of Lindisfarn: his impriſonment began in 750, and continued for 30 years, being accuſed as an accomplice in a crime, of which ſome authors aſſert he was innocent.</p>
               <p>According to Florence of Worceſter, <hi>Alred,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Eardulph,</hi> whom <hi>Athelſtan</hi> expelled, (on the death of <hi>Sititric,</hi> who married <hi>Athelſtan</hi>'s ſiſter, and was by him raiſed to the Northumbrian throne) in the year 926 ſeized this fortreſs, and made himſelf maſter of the dependent ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, but was ſoon forced to fly before the arms of <hi>Athelſtan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the deſcent made by the <hi>Danes</hi> about the year 933, this fortreſs ſuffered greatly, but was ſoon afterwards reſtored, and new works were added. It is ſaid a great booty fell into the hands of theſe invaders, by the reduction of <hi>Bambrough.</hi>

                  <hi>Waltheof Earl of Northumberland,</hi> in his declining years, was diſturbed by an incurſion of the Scots, under <hi>Malcolm</hi> their King: he retired to this fortreſs, whilſt his ſon <hi>Uchtred,</hi> a valiant youth, raiſed a few troops to oppoſe the army of the invader. He gained an advantageous poſt, and with great bravery made ſuch an attack upon the undiſciplined Scots, that they were ſoon thrown into confuſion, and after ſuffering a dreadful ſlaughter, made an inglorious concluſion of their invaſion, by a precipitate retreat into their own country. <hi>Uchtred</hi> did not conduct his ſucceſs with temperance; he ſullied his victory with cruelty, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly ſlaughtering in cold blood, the nobility and officers of rank which were among his priſoners, their heads becoming the horrid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the walls of <hi>Durham.</hi> King <hi>Ethelred</hi> overlooked this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and rewarded his valour by giving him in marriage his daughter <hi>Edgiva,</hi> with a princely portion; his father reſigning his poſſeſſions to the young hero, the King added thereto the county of <hi>York.</hi> The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage barbarity of thoſe times is ſhocking to humanity; there was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a victory obtained in the reciprocal depredations made on the

borders, but the utmoſt cruelty and undiſtinguiſhed ſlaughter was the conſequence. The warfare itſelf was infamous; for it was no better than robbing by a Banditti commanded by Kings, who ſullied the luſtre of a Crown by impious acts which will for ever remain ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in ſtory.</p>

               <p>In the reign of <hi>William</hi> II. A.

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0085300202:168"/>In the next reign it was intruſted by King <hi>Henry</hi> I. to <hi>Euſtace Fitz-John,</hi> who was diſpoſſeſſed of it and his other employments by King <hi>Stephen,</hi> jealous of his attachment to <hi>Maud,</hi> daughter of King Henry I.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0085300202:169"/>
Irritated at this injury, <hi>Fitz-John</hi> attached himſelf to <hi>David</hi> King of Scotland, and levied a great force from his barony of <hi>Alnwick,</hi> with which he openly joined the Scotch invader. They marched towards <hi>Bambrough,</hi> and made a regular attack; but ſo far from being able to poſſeſs the place, they only forced an outwork, which had been lately erected, and put to the ſword about 100 of the defenders, by whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful ſpeeches they were irritated to the aſſault. After deſtroying the corn, hamlets, and erections in the adjacent country, they marched ſouthward; and in the county of <hi>Durham</hi> being joined by a large body
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0085300202:170"/>
of forces from <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> with <hi>King David</hi> at their head, they advanced to <hi>Northallerton,</hi> and ſoon after were defeated at the battle of <hi>the ſtandard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the conditions of peace made between King Stephen and King David I. of Scotland, it was ſtipulated, that the earldom of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland ſhould be concluſively ſettled on Prince Henry, David's ſon, with all its appendages, except <hi>Bambrough</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which the Engliſh Monarch was to retain on Henry's receiving a compenſation by lands in the ſouth of England. All the Barons within this earldom did homage to Prince Henry for their eſtates, with a ſalvo for the fealty they had ſworn to King Stephen, it having alſo been premiſed, that the laws and cuſtoms eſtabliſhed by King Henry I. in Northumberland ſhould remain in force. This treaty was ratified at Durham, in the month of April, A. D. 1139, in the preſence of Maude Queen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and a great aſſembly of the Barons of both nations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King of Scotland and his ſon entered into compact for the maintenance of peace with England during their lives; for the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which Coſpatric Earl of March, Hugh de Morvill, Fergus Mel and Mac were given as hoſtages.</p>
               <p>King Henry II. in the third year of his reign, had reſtored to him, by Malcolm IV. King of Scotland, the northern territories which King Stephen had granted to David King of Scotland: and therewith King Henry was put in poſſeſſion of the city of Carliſle, the caſtle of Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough, and Newcaſtle upon Tyne. It is preſumed by ſome authors, that David having taken advantage of the broils in which King Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen was involved, had ſeized the caſtle of Bambrough; as in the treaty when the earldom of Northumberland was reſigned to Prince Henry, this fortreſs and Newcaſtle were expreſsly reſerved to the Crown of England.</p>
               <p>In the 16th year of <hi>King Henry the Second's</hi> reign, ſome great work ſeems to have been added to this fortreſs, as in Madox's Hiſtory of the Exchequer, under the article of Amercements, it appears one <hi>William,</hi> ſon of <hi>Waldef,</hi> was fined five marks for refuſing his aſſiſtance in the King's works at <hi>Baenburg Caſtle:</hi> he was fined alſo 40s. to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite touching the ſaid works.

               <p>In 1296, King Edward I. ſummoned <hi>John Baliol,</hi> King of Scotland to renew his homage at this caſtle; but the proud vaſſal forgetting his fidelity, contemned the command, and levied an army to reſiſt the Engliſh arms, if Edward entered his kingdom. Edward burning with indignation at this inſolence, marched to <hi>Berwick,</hi> which he took by ſtorm, and put the garriſon to the ſword. From thence proceeding to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> near which place the Scotch army waited his approach, an engagement enſued, in which the Engliſh were victorious: the field of battle was covered with innumerable carcaſſes, 22,000 Scots, ſome Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians aſſert, fell that day. <hi>Dunbar</hi> was taken, and <hi>Baliol</hi> was made priſoner. The great trophy of this victory, was <hi>the ſtone chair</hi> in which the Kings of Scotland had been crowned from the earlieſt times. This was the <hi>palladium</hi> of the Scotch, the loſs of which ſhook the ſuperſtition of the whole empire. This <hi>chair</hi> was brought in triumph to England, with the King in chains, and was placed in <hi>the abbey of Weſtminſter,</hi> where it has remained for regal honours ever ſince—a degree of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation which nothing but the bigotry and ſuperſtition of that age could have decreed to it in England.<note n="*" place="bottom">To increaſe the ſuperſtitions import of this <hi>palladium</hi> of <hi>monarchy,</hi> it is reported that it contains or is compoſed of the ſtone of <hi>Beth-el,</hi> on which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſlept when he had the beatific viſion, and received the promiſes of inheritance from the voice of the Supreme.</note>

               <p>It was held for a ſhort time by <hi>Roger Heron,</hi> a younger ſon of <hi>William Heron</hi> before mentioned; after which it was conferred on <hi>Henry Percy,</hi> for his good ſervices in the Scotch wars. In this family it continued for ſeveral ages, and a grant of this caſtle, together with the manor and fee farms of the town, was made to his grandſon for life. In the reign of King Henry VI. <hi>Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland,</hi> was Conſtable. During the contention between the King and the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> there were divers Governors, according to the party which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be victorious. <hi>Sir Ralph Grey</hi> and <hi>John Lord Wenlock</hi> were both of them Conſtables for Henry VI. the latter in the 25th year of that King: he nevertheleſs ſided with King Edward IV. and ſerved under him at <hi>Towton.</hi>

               <p>In the ſecond year of the reign of King Edward IV. an inſurrection of the Lancaſtrian party appearing in the North, the King advanced to <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and at once laid ſiege to the three caſtles of <hi>Alnwick, Dunſtanburgh,</hi> and <hi>Bambrough.</hi> Ten thouſand forces inveſted the latter under the command of the <hi>Earl of Worceſter,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Arundel,</hi> the <hi>Lord Ogle,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Montecute:</hi> the <hi>Duke of Somerſet,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Pembroke, Lord Roos,</hi> and <hi>Sir Ralph Percy</hi> maintained the fortreſs until Chriſtmas eve, when it was ſurrendered.

Levels</hi> ſoon put a final end to theſe commotions, and gave a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive blow to the hopes of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter.

               </p>
               <p>The damages the caſtle had ſuſtained, were not repaired in that or the ſucceeding reigns: King Henry VII. and King Henry VIII. both eſteemed thoſe caſtles as places of refuge only for malecontents. From the time of King Edward IV. there is a total ſuſpenſion of its hiſtory. By the eſcheats of the 10th of Queen Elizabeth, it appears to be in the Crown, with the adjoining caſtle of <hi>Dunſtanburgh. Sir John Foſter</hi> of <hi>Bambrough Abbey,</hi> was then Governor of this caſtle. His grandſon, <hi>John Foſter, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
                  </hi> had a grant of the manor of <hi>Bambrough</hi> from King James; but in the year 1715, his deſcendant forfeited, and it was purchaſed by his uncle, <hi>Lord Crew.</hi>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0085300202:180"/>
one <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Sharp.</note> of them makes this place his reſidence, and bleſſes the coaſt by his judicious and humane application of the Prelate's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bequeſt. He has repaired and rendered habitable the great ſquare tower: the part reſerved for himſelf and family, is a large hall and a few ſmaller apartments; but the reſt of the ſpacious edifice is allotted for purpoſes, which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of. The upper part is an ample granary; from whence corn is diſpenſed to the poor without diſtinction, even in the deareſt time, at the rate of four ſhillings a buſhel; and the diſtreſſed, for many miles round, often experience the conveniency of this benefaction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Other apartments are fitted up for ſhipwrecked ſailors, and bedding is provided for 30, ſhould ſuch a number happen to be caſt on ſhore at the ſame time. A conſtant patrol is kept every ſtormy night along this tempeſtuous coaſt, for above 8 miles, the length of the manor, by which means numbers of lives have been preſerved. Many poor wretches are often found on the ſhore in a ſtate of inſenſibility; but by timely relief, are ſoon brought to themſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It often happens, that ſhips ſtrike in ſuch a manner on the rocks as to be capable of relief, in caſe numbers of people could be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly aſſembled: for that purpoſe a cannon <note n="†" place="bottom">Once belonging to a Dutch frigate of 40 guns, which with all the crew was loſt oppoſite to the caſtle, about 60 years ago.</note> is fixed on the top of the tower, which is fired once, if the accident happens in ſuch a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; twice, if in another; and thrice, if in ſuch a place. By theſe ſignals the country people are directed to the ſpot they are to fly to; and by this means, frequently preſerve not only the crew, but even the veſſel; for machines of different kinds are always in readineſs to heave ſhips out of their perilous ſituation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In a word, all the ſchemes of this worthy Truſtee have a humane and uſeful tendency: he ſeems as if ſelected from his brethren for the ſame purpoſes as Spenſer tells us the firſt of his ſeven beadſmen in the houſe of holineſſe was.</q>

                                 <p n="1">I. A gun (a nine-pounder) placed at the bottom of the tower, to be fired as a ſignal in caſe any ſhip or veſſel be obſerved in diſtreſs, viz. once, when any ſhip or veſſel is ſtranded or wrecked upon the iſlands, or any adjacent rock: twice, when any ſhip or veſſel is ſtranded or wrecked behind the caſtle, or to the northward of it: thrice, when any ſhip or veſſel is ſtranded or wrecked to the ſouthward of the caſtle; in order that the cuſtom-houſe officers, and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with their ſervants, may haſten to give all poſſible aſſiſtance—as well as to prevent the wreck from being plundered.</p>
                                 <p n="2">II. In every great ſtorm, two men on horſeback are ſent from the caſtle to patrol along the coaſt, from ſun-ſet to ſun-riſe, that, in caſe of an accident, one may remain by the ſhip, and other return to alarm the caſtle. Whoever brings the firſt notice of any ſhip or veſſel being in diſtreſs, is intitled to a premium, in proportion to the diſtance from the caſtle; and if between twelve o'clock at night and three o'clock in the morning, the premium to be double.</p>
                                 <p n="3">III. A large flag is hoiſted, when there is any ſhip or veſſel ſeen in diſtreſs upon the Fern Iſlands, or Staples, that the ſufferers may have the ſatisfaction of knowing their diſtreſs is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ſhore, and that relief will be ſent them as ſoon as poſſible. In caſe of bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the flag will be kept up, a gun fired morning and evening, and a rocket thrown up every night from the north turret, till ſuch time as relief can be ſent. Theſe are alſo ſignals to the Holy Iſland Fiſhermen, who by the advantage of their ſituation, can put off for the iſlands at times when no boat from the main land can get over the breakers. Premiums are given to the firſt boats that put off for the iſlands, to give their aſſiſtance to ſhips or veſſels in diſtreſs, and proviſions and liquors are ſent in the boats.</p>
                                 <p n="4">IV. A bell on the ſouth turret will be rung out in every thick fog, as a ſignal to the fiſhing boats; and a large ſwivel fixed on the eaſt turret will be fired every fifteen minutes, as a ſignal to the ſhips without the iſlands.</p>
                                 <p n="5">V. A large weather-cock is fixed on the top of the flag-ſtaff, for the uſe of the pilots.</p>
                                 <p n="6">VI. A large ſpeaking trumpet is provided, to be uſed when ſhips are in diſtreſs near the ſhore, or are run aground.</p>
                                 <p n="7">VII. An obſervatory or watch tower is made on the eaſt turret of the caſtle, where a perſon is to extend every morning at day-break during the winter ſeaſon, to look out if any ſhips be in diſtreſs.</p>
                                 <p n="8">VIII. Maſters and Commanders of ſhips or veſſels in diſtreſs, are deſired to make ſuch ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals as are uſually made by people in their melancholy ſituation.</p>
                                 <p>Aſſiſtance, Stores, and Proviſions, prepared at Bambrough Caſtle for Seamen, Ships or Veſſels, wrecked or driven a-ſhore on that coaſt or neighbourhood.</p>
                                 <p n="1">I. Rooms and beds are prepared for ſeamen, ſhip-wrecked, who will be maintained in the caſtle for a week (or longer, according to circumſtances) and during that time be found with all manner of neceſſaries.</p>
                                 <p n="2">II. Cellars for wine and other liquors from ſhip-wrecked veſſels, in which they are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited for one year, in order to be claimed by the proper owners.</p>
                                 <p n="3">III. A ſtore-houſe ready for the reception of wrecked goods, cables, rigging, and iron. A book is kept for entering all kinds of timber and other wrecked goods, giving the marks and deſcription of each, with the date when they came on ſhore.</p>
                                 <p n="4">IV. Four pair of ſcrews for raiſing ſhips that are ſtranded, in order to their being repaired. —Timber, blocks and tackles, handſpokes, cables, ropes, pumps and iron, ready for the uſe of ſhip-wrecked veſſels.</p>
                                 <p>N. B. But if taken away, to be paid for at prime coſt.</p>
                                 <p n="5">V. A pair of chains with large rings and ſwivels, made on purpoſe for weighing ſhips (of a thouſand tons burthen) that are ſunk upon rocks, or in deep water.</p>
                                 <p>N. B. Theſe chains are to be lent (gratis) to any perſon having occaſion for them, within forty or fifty miles along the coaſt, on giving proper ſecurity to re-deliver them to the Truſtees.</p>
                                 <p n="6">VI. Two mooring chains of different lengths are provided, which may occaſionally be joined together, when a greater length is required.</p>
                                 <p n="7">VII. Whenever any dead bodies are caſt on ſhore, coffins, &amp;c. will be provided, gratis, and alſo the funeral expences paid.</p>

               <p>So extenſive a charity, to flow from a private bounty, is ſingular: men in former ages were canonized for trifling acts of benevolence, compared to this. But although the reſources were given by Lord Crew, yet the diſpoſition was not of his arrangement; to the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heart of <hi>the Rev. Dr Sharp,</hi> the chief part of the bleſſings derived from his Lordſhip's will is to be attributed. He reſides many months in each year in <hi>the caſtle of Bambrough,</hi> ſuperintends the works of charity, has his eye open upon every new channel by which he may give relief or conſolation to his ſuffering fellow-creatures.

The extreme point of view is <hi>Tynemouth,</hi> whoſe ruined monaſtery gives an obeliſk to terminate the landſkip.

Indeed moſt of the miraculous works of the religious were deduced from ſome knowledge of the ſimpleſt principles of nature, diſcovered and diſplayed in ages of profound ignorance. In Bede's third book of the hiſtory of the Church of England, touching the miracles wrought by Aidan, this practice is thus mentioned. <q>A certain prieſt named <hi>Utta,</hi> a man of great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and ſincerity, and one who for his qualities and truth was well eſteemed, was commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to go into Kent, for <hi>Eanflede,</hi> King <hi>Edwine</hi>'s daughter, who after her father's death had been ſent thither, in order to her eſpouſal with King <hi>Oſwin.</hi> He was to travel by land to Kent, but to return by ſea; on which account he addreſſed Biſhop Aidan, beſeeching him to put up fervent prayers to God to proſper their Voyage. The Biſhop gave them his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and having recommended them devoutly to the protection of God, he alſo delivered to Utta ſome jars of hallowed oil, ſaying, I foreſee that whilſt you are at ſea, a ſudden tempeſt will come upon you; remember to caſt into the troubled waters the oil that I give you, and and ſpeedily the tempeſt ſhall be aſſuaged, the ſea be calmed, and you ſhall have a pleaſant paſſage. All theſe things were fulfilled according to the prophecy. At the beginning of the tempeſt, when the waves and ſurges chiefly raged, the ſailors endeavoured in vain to caſt anchor; but the ſtorm increaſed, and the waves multiplied ſo faſt, that the veſſel was almoſt filled with water, and nothing but immediate death preſented itſelf. In this diſtreſs the Prieſt had recourſe to the Biſhop's directions, and took the pot of oil, ſome of which he caſt into the ſea, and the ſea was immediately calmed, the ſun ſoon after ſhone forth, and the ſhip proceeded with a proſperous voyage. Thus the man of God, through the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, predicted the tempeſt, and by the ſame holy ſpirit, though he was himſelf abſent, appeaſed the ſame.</q>

Since the departure of the religious, this iſland has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned almoſt to its priſtine ſtate: it conſiſts of a few acres in its whole ſurface, the chief part of which is ſand and rock. A ſcanty herbage takes place indeed in ſome ſpots, eſpecially on the little lawn; but there is neither tree or ſhrub. The ſhore is rocky, and ſounding to the hollow ſea which rolls upon it, ſends forth a horrid howling: the north-eaſt winds blow fiercely here, and every inclemency of weather known to the climate beats on theſe inhoſpitable ſhores, which are tremendous from frequent ſhipwrecks.—There is not a coaſt more likely to give one the idea of ſhoals of wandering ſpirits, who viſit the <hi>ſemiſepulta Oſſa,</hi> over which they loiter on this ſide Styx, whilſt unfriendly whirlwinds wreck them over with ſand, and forbid the funeral rites for which they languiſh.</p>

                  </note> The rocks to the north are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, of a columniary form, about 30 feet in height, black and horrible; the ſhore rugged, covered with broken rocks woven over with ſea-weed. From the edge of the ſea cliffs on the north-weſt point, the weſtern wall runs along the brink of an elevated rock; a ſquare tower ariſes near the center of this wall, of a conſiderable height, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent maſonry, placed on a projecting point of the cliff, ſo as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the armed men within a means of flanking the wall with their miſſile weapons; on each corner there was an exploratory turret. This ſeems to be the moſt modern part of the caſtle, built of the beſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and by the ableſt workmen. Where the land riſes to the ſummit of the rock on the ſouth-weſt point, the wall turns and makes a long ſtraight front to the ſouth, as repreſented in the plate: the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is level, and appears to have been aſſiſted by art, to form a more commodious parade for the garriſon. In this front there is a gate-way, built in a very remarkable ſtile, being the great entrance to the caſtle: it is formed by a circular arch, with a portico and interior gate; is defended by two heavy ſemicircular towers uniting with the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of the gate-way: theſe towers, after riſing about 20 feet, and containing two tiers of apartments, ſupport turrets of a ſquare form, now ſo very rugged and ruinous, as not to allow a conjecture what was their original height. This wall extends to the cliffs on the ſea banks, is guarded by two ſquare baſtions and a ſmall ſally-port, and is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by a ſquare tower with a gate-way. On the brink of the cliff to the ſea, on this quarter, appear the remains of a very ſtrong wall; indeed it is probable the whole Area was originally ſo encloſed. The heavy ſeas which break upon the rocks of the north-weſt point have torn them much; and it appears as if the area had been originally of greater extent than at preſent, many ſeparate columns of rock ſtanding near the cliffs, which ſome ages ago may have been joined to the main land. At the ſouth point of the area is the well: near to the eaſtern tower are the remains of a chapel. Immediately below this tower is a gully or paſſage of perpendicular ſides, formed in the rocks, about 60 yards in length and 40 feet deep, where the ſea makes a dreadful inſet, breaking into foam with a tremendous noiſe: the ſpray
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0085300202:194"/>
occaſioned thereby is driven within the caſtle walls. This place is called by the country people <hi>the Rumble Churn.</hi> The gulph, from the walls of the tower, which I aſcended to obtain the view, has a very awful appearance: you look immediately down upon the abyſs, where, as the tide ruſhes up, the waters are lifted many feet above the common level, riſing towards the walls of the tower, as if they would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the cliffs and deluge the plain. The breaking of the waves in foam over the extreme point of the rocks, the heavy ſpray, the noiſe of the diſturbed waters, and the groan which echo returns through the deſolated towers, are noble, though tremendous.</p>
               <p>The date of this caſtle is fixed by authors to the beginning of the 14th century, <hi>Thomas Earl of Lancaſter,</hi> General of the confederate army which oppoſed King Edward II. being ſaid to be the founder. He was alſo owner of <hi>Pomfret Caſtle,</hi> where, after being taken by the King's troops at <hi>Burrowbridge,</hi> he was impriſoned, and ſoon after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collated as a traitor; though afterwards he was canonized, and the place of his martyrdom took the name of <hi>St. Thomas's Hill.</hi> He was poſſeſſed of immenſe eſtates, and was the moſt powerful and opulent ſubject in Europe, holding at once the Earldoms of <hi>Lancaſter, Lincoln, Salisbury, Leiceſter, and Darby.</hi> The King ſat perſonally on his trial, a remarkable circumſtance: he died 25th March, 1322, and was buried on the ſouth ſide of the high altar in the priory church there. Such veneration was paid to his tomb, as the enthuſiaſts waſted on that of Becket. The King of his royal clemency remitted the ſeverities of his ſentence, by which he was condemned to be hanged and quartered, an infamy which ſeldom had fallen on thoſe of royal deſcent, he being grandſon of King Henry III. But ſo fluctuating are human affairs, that the ignominious exit of this Earl, gave exalted honours to his name after his death: he was enrolled in the liſt of Martyrs, was canonized, and his portrait placed among thoſe of ſacred memory in the cathedral of St. Paul's.</p>

               <head>THE CASTLE OF ALNWICK.</head>
               <p>The ſituation is not naturally elegant, the aſpect being rather confined, and the adjacent lands affording no original beauties. The oppoſite hills riſe tamely, and are not yet brought into ſuch order, as to poſſeſs artificial graces enough, to conceal the want of that variety and beauty, which a traveller wiſhes to find ſurrounding ſo noble a palace. The woody banks of the <hi>Aln,</hi> with all the wild romantic ſcenes which hang upon her borders, are excluded from the proſpect. The caſtle ſtands upon a fine elevation, riſing gradually from the river, whoſe open banks are turfed and kept in the moſt exact neatneſs under the gardener's ſcythe; but withal, poſſeſſing that trim countenance, given by ſtraight lines and angles, level walks, and ſlopes of a mechanical formality; a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0085300202:200"/>
garb in which nature doth not look the moſt lovely. <hi>The caſtle</hi> is a noble ſtructure, rebuilt on the old foundation, and in the Saxon ſtyle; the architect has ſtrictly preſerved the whole modes and ornaments of the original: the battlements are crowded with effigies, according to the taſte of the Normans, in whoſe time it underwent a principal repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: theſe repreſent men in the act of defence, wielding ſuch arms as were then uſed; ſome of them are diſpoſed with great propriety, the guard of one of the gate-ways is in the attitude of caſting down a mighty ſtone on the heads of aſſailants. The building is of a beautiful free-ſtone, in chiſel'd work; its form is ſingular, being compoſed of a cluſter of ſemicircular and angular baſtions. I cannot, without the ichnography of the place, give the reader a more competent idea of its figure, than by comparing it to a ſection of the cluſtered Saxon pillar in our cathedrals. This edifice ſtands in a ſpacious area, which at the time of its greateſt ſtrength, I preſume, totally ſurrounded it, defended by a compleat circumvallation and a moat; otherwiſe the principal part of the fortreſs would have lain unguarded by any outwork, except a moat. At preſent the front is opened to the north-eaſt, and the wall having towers at proper intervals, ſhuts it in on the other quarters. As we viewed the caſtle on our approach, the walls with its towers formed a noble flanking to the principal ſtructure: to the ſouthward, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den grounds appeared prettily diſpoſed; to the north and weſt, the town of Alnwick was ſeen ſpreading on the back ground. We lamented the want of ſome of thoſe fine woodlands, and lofty grey rocks, which impend over the Aln, above Alnwick, to give rural and romantic graces to objects ſo imperial, if I may be permitted to uſe the expreſſion, in diſtinguiſhing this noble edifice.</p>
               <p>We paſſed over an elegant ſtone bridge, on our approach to the town, the battlements formed of interwoven creſcents: we found the Inn crowded with people of fortune, come from all parts of the county, to pay their compliments to the Duke and Ducheſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Her Grace was living when the author made his tour and compiled this work. He ſhould think himſelf happy, could he compoſe an Eulogium equal to ſo eminent and illuſtrious a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> it being their firſt public day, after their arrival at this palace for the ſummer receſs.</p>
               <p>The approach to the caſtle retains much of the ſolemn grandeur of ancient times: the inſcription on the gate-way ſtill legible, <q>Eſperance
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0085300202:201"/>
me comforteth,</q> appertained to the arms of the Percies, and was placed there when the repairs were made by that family: the moat is drained, and the ceremony of letting down the draw-bridge is forgot; but the walls which encloſe the area ſtill wear the ancient countenance of ſtrength and defiance. You enter by a machicolated gate, defended by an upper tower, and after paſſing a covered way, approach the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior gate which admits you to the area: this entrance is defended by all the devices uſed in ancient times; iron ſtudded gates, portcullis, open galleries, and apertures in the arching for annoying aſſailants. The ingenious traveller, Mr Pennant, had been out of humour when he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited this place. We met with all the inconveniences of a noiſy and crowded Inn, with every awkward circumſtance which could befall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, who had undergone no little fatigue in purſuing the paths of pleaſure; and yet we could not ſubmit to coincide with that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſentiments: <q>You look (ſays he) in vain, for any marks of the grandeur of the feodal age, for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military proweſs and deeds of chivalry; for halls hung with helms and hauberks, or with the ſpoils of the chace; for exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive foreſts and venerable oaks. Ye look in vain for the helmet on the tower, the ancient ſignal of hoſpitality to the traveller, or for the grey-headed Porter, to conduct him to the hall of entertainment. The numerous train whoſe countenances give welcome to him on his way, are now no more; and inſtead of the diſintereſted Uſher of the old times, he is attended by a Valet, eager to receive the fees of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</q> I muſt beg leave to pronounce, that though the ſavage fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the feodal ages is taken away, yet not the marks of grandeur: we ſaw no miſerable dungeons filled with captives, no places of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groaning under their execrable burthen; the towers remain, but without the cry of captivity and torture: Hoſpitality cloathed in princely array, ſits in the hall, diſpenſing with a brow of benignity, mixed with features of the higheſt magnificence, gifts worthy her hand: the Duke and Ducheſs are eaſy of acceſs, and of an affable deportment; their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants are happy under their ſmiles, without being awed by their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. The attention they pay to the petitions of dependents, is marked with the greateſt benevolence; no vain promiſes are given to ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, no hopes are flattered without ſincerity—the ſtricteſt honour attends the moſt trivial actions. A truly great principle diſtinguiſhes theſe noble perſonages; amidſt a happy liberality, there is ſo exact a propriety, and ſuch perfect oeconomy, that no tranſaction paſſes in the houſehold, without a certain rule, and ſingular regularity. The innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0085300202:202"/>
charities they pour forth, are beſtowed with ſuch admirable propriety, that each perſon relieved at the gate, brings a ticket as an authority to the officer for the diſpenſation of his Lord's bounty; ſo that improper objects cannot deceive, or crafty knaves obtain the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſigned for the relief of the truly neceſſitous and meritorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. To enumerate acts of benevolence is inconſiſtent with my plan, but ſome are ſo ſingularly worthy the world's attention, that I cannot reſiſt the pleaſure of relating a ſingle tranſaction, which on my hearing it, brought tears of joy into my eyes.</p>
               <p>Her grace returning from an airing in her chariot, paſſed through the ranks of people in the gate-ways, who attended to receive a daily diſtribution to the poor. A widow oppreſſed with grievous neceſſity, could not leave her domeſtic employment, or her labour, to attend with her ticket; ſhe entruſted it to her daughter, a girl about ſeven years of age, who took her parent's place at the gate. Her Grace obſerved this girl employed in knitting, whilſt all the reſt of the indigent group ſat with idle hands: ſhe ſent a ſervant to bring the child to her, who received the meſſage with aſtoniſhment and apprehenſion; ſhe followed the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger with trembling ſteps, revolving in her mind the ſuppoſed offences ſhe had committed, and looking with eyes ſwimming in tears on the ill-fated work, ſhe held in her hand, as the cauſe of her Grace's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Pale with apprehenſion of reproof, ſhe approached the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs; confuſion and dread were mixed upon her features, whilſt looks of timid innocence lived in her eyes. Her grace perceived the child's diſtreſs, but conceived not the cauſe. When the infant had recollected courage enough to give her the power of expreſſion, ſhe began a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and fearful excuſe for the ſuppoſed crime ſhe had committed, in knitting at the gate: a ſmile of divine benevolence aroſe upon the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs's countenance—ſimplicity and native innocence have great charms —ſhe was won by the child's ſenſibility as well as by her induſtry. The girl was taken from her indigent mother, cloathed and put to ſchool, where ſhe is acquiring thoſe accompliſhments, which one day will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance her above the rank of her humble progenitors.</p>
               <p>The inſide of this palace is finiſhed in a moſt ſplendid taſte, every thing (to uſe Mr Pennant's expreſſion) being compleated with <q>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible elegance.</q> A particular account of ſuits of apartments, finiſhed and furniſhed in the higheſt manner, would be tedious: the rich variety is for the eye only. The chief deſcriptions I will borrow

                  <q>This caſtle, like many others in the north, was anciently orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with figures of warriors, diſtributed round the battlements, and therefore the preſent noble proprietors have allowed them to be continued, and have ſupplied ſome that had been deſtroyed, but to ſhew what they once were; and, that this is no innovation, they have retained the ancient ones, though defaced, which were placed on the top of the two octagon towers.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Nothing can be more ſtriking than the effect at firſt entrance within the walls from the town, when through a dark gloomy gateway of conſiderable length and depth, the eye ſuddenly emerges into one of the moſt ſplendid ſcenes that can be imagined; and is preſented at once with the great body of the inner caſtle, ſurrounded with fair ſemi-circular towers, finely ſwelling to the eye, and gayly adorned with pinnacles, figures, battlements, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The impreſſion is ſtill further ſtrengthened by the ſucceſſive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the ſecond and third courts, thro' great maſſy towers, till the ſtranger is landed in the inner court, in the very center of this great citadel.</q>

                  <q>Here he enters to a moſt beautiful ſtair-caſe, of a very ſingular yet pleaſing form, expanding like a fan: the cornice of the ceiling is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with a ſeries of 120 eſcutcheons, diſplaying the principal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings and intermarriages of the Percy family. The ſpace occupied by this ſtair-caſe is 46 feet long, 35 feet 4 inches wide, and 43 feet 2 inches high.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To this ſucceeds the drawing-room, conſiſting of one large oval, with a ſemicircular projection, or bow-window. It is 46 feet 7 inches long, 35 feet 4 inches wide, and 22 feet high.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Hence the tranſition is very properly to the great dining room; which was one of the firſt executed, and is of the pureſt Gothic, with nitches and other ornaments, that render it a very noble model of a great Baron's hall. In this room was an irregularity in the form, which has been managed with great ſkill and judgment, and made productive of beauty and convenience. This was a large bow-window, not in the center, but towards the upper end, which now affords a very agreeable receſs when the family dine alone, or for a ſecond table at the great public dinners. This room is 53 feet 9 inches long, 20 feet 10 inches wide, (excluſive of the circular receſs, which is 19 feet in diameter) and 26 feet 9 inches high.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>From the dining-room, the ſtranger may either deſcend into the court, by a circular Stair-caſe, or he is uſhered into a very beautiful Gothic apartment over the gateway, commonly uſed for a breakfaſt or ſupper-room: this is furniſhed with cloſets in the octagon towers, and is connected with other private apartments. It is 38 feet 4 inches long, . . feet wide, and 16 feet 1 inch high.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Hence the ſtranger is conducted into the library, which is a very fine room, in the form of a parallelogram, properly fitted up for books, and ornamented with ſtucco-work in a very rich Gothic ſtyle; being 64 feet long, . . wide, and 16 feet 1 inch high.

Here the higheſt diſplay of Gothic ornaments in the greateſt beauty has been very properly exhibited; and the ſeveral parts of the chapel have been deſigned after the moſt perfect models of Gothic excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The great eaſt window is taken from one of the fineſt in York minſter. The ceiling is borrowed from that of King's college, in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; and the walls are painted after the great church in Milan: but the windows of painted glaſs will be in a ſtile ſuperior to any thing that has yet been attempted, and worthy of the preſent more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

                  <q>Returning from the chapel through the library, and paſſing by another great ſtair-caſe, (that fills an oval ſpace 22 feet 9 inches long, and 15 feet 3 inches wide) we enter a paſſage or gallery which leads to two great ſtate-bed chambers, each 30 feet long, moſt nobly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, with double dreſſing rooms, cloſets, and other conveniencies, all in the higheſt elegance and magnificence, but as conformable as poſſible to the general ſtile of the caſtle. From theſe bed-chambers the paſſage opens to the grand ſtair-caſe, by which we firſt entered, and compleats a tour not eaſily to be paralleled.</q>

               <p>I muſt now turn my attention to the antiquity and hiſtory of this place.</p>
               <p>Mr Groſe ſays, <q>it is believed to have been founded in the time of the Romans, although no part of the original ſtructure is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. But when part of the dungeon or caſtle keep was taken down to be repaired ſome years ago, under the preſent walls were diſcovered the foundations of other buildings, which lay in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent direction from the preſent; and ſome of the ſtones appeared to have Roman mouldings. "The dungeon or keep of the preſent caſtle, is believed to have been founded in the Saxon times. The zigzag fret-work round the arch that leads into the inner court, is evidently of Saxon architecture; and yet this was probably not the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient entrance; for under the flag tower, before that part was taken down and rebuilt by the preſent Duke, was the appearance of a gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that had been walled up; directly fronting the preſent outward gateway into the town."</q>

               <p>King William Rufus, being required by King Malcolm of Scotland to fulfil the articles concluded upon in the truce made in 1091, gave the Scotch Monarch aſſurances of their completion, upon his repairing to his court, to which he ordered him to be honourably conducted. On his arrival, he was received with great inſolence and contempt, being refuſed admittance to the King's preſence, who inſiſted that Malcolm ſhould ſubmit his claim to the judgment of the Engliſh peers. Malcolm with a becoming dignity refuſed, alledging if there was any diſpute to his title, it ſhould be ſettled on the Marches, by men of both nations, agreeable to the laws and cuſtoms eſtabliſhed there.

               <p>In the year 1135, King David I. of Scotland ſeized upon the caſtles of Northumberland, <hi>Alnwick</hi> being one, previous to the treaty entered into between him and King Stephen.</p>
               <p>After King William of Scotland, ſirnamed the Lion, made his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful retreat from the caſtle of <hi>Prudhoe,</hi> A. D. 1174, he beſet the caſtle of <hi>Alnwick</hi> with his whole army, conſiſting of 80,000 men: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repulſed for ſome time, he formed a blockade, and drew off many of his forces in plundering parties, to pillage the country; one of which, as Benedict of Peterborough ſays, commanded by Earl <hi>Duncan,</hi> entered the town of <hi>Warkworth,</hi> burnt it, and put all the inhabitants to the ſword, without diſtinction of age or ſex; and that he made his ſoldiers break open the church of St Lawrence in that place, in which,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0085300202:219"/>
and in the houſe of the Miniſter, they flew above one hundred men, bedſies women and children. <hi>Bernard Baliol,</hi> a youth of great forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, with about 400 horſemen raiſed at Newcaſtle, engaged in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize to ſurprize the Scotch Monarch: they were favoured in their march by a thick fog, which kept them concealed till they reached the environs of Alnwick, when diſcovering the King attended by about 60 of his chief followers on a reconnoitering party, they came upon them unexpectedly on Saturday the 5th day of July, whilſt the principal parts of his vaſt army were ſcattered over the country in acts of rapine and violence, and the others laying in an idle and unſuſpicious ſecurity before the caſtle, a conflict enſued, in which the King's horſe was killed under him, and many of his attendants were ſlain, the King being made priſoner. The ſtraggling parties were put to the route or taken, to a great amount in number, before they gained intelligence of the real force of their opponents: and the King of thoſe robbers, after being confined ſome time in Richmond Caſtle, was removed to London, and afterwards ranſomed for 100,000l. at the ſame time doing homage for his crown: as a memorial of which ſubmiſſion, he depoſited his arms at the altar in York Minſter.</p>
               <p>In the reign of King John, A. D. 1212, <hi>Euſtace de Veſey</hi> being accuſed of a conſpiracy againſt the King's life, fled into Scotland. His caſtle was ordered to be raſed; but the apprehenſion of a ſouthern rebellion diverted the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſtace</hi> with the northern Barons, A. D. 1216, at <hi>Felton</hi> did homage to Alexander II. King of Scotland, his brother-in-law, which ſo much incenſed King John, that he poured forth into the north a large army, laid <hi>Felton</hi> in aſhes, together with the towns of <hi>Mitford, Morpeth, Aln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Wark,</hi> and <hi>Roxburgh.</hi> Whilſt John made theſe dreadful depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Northumberland, the Lord <hi>Euſtace,</hi> with King Alexander, made an incurſion as far as <hi>Barnardcaſtle,</hi> in the country of Durham, to which they laid ſiege; and being out on horſeback, to take a view of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, in order to plan an aſſault, making too near an approach, <hi>Euſtace</hi> loſt his life by an arrow ſhot from ſome of the out-poſts.</p>
               <p>What greatly contributed to prolong the inteſtine troubles of Henry the Third's kingdom in 1266, was the deſpair of the rebel Barons, by the forfeitures of their eſtates, under the determinations of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wincheſter. <hi>John de Veſey</hi> was one of them, and having been
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0085300202:220"/>
deprived of his caſtle and barony of Alnwick, he entered into a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with ſeveral others labouring under the ſame proſcription, for the recovery of their poſſeſſions. <hi>Veſey</hi> raiſed a ſufficient force to gain his caſtle, but Prince Edward coming againſt him with a ſtrong body of forces, reduced his garriſon to ſuch diſtreſs, that he was obliged to ſurrender, and ſubmit himſelf to the Prince's mercy; through whoſe interceſſion he received the royal pardon.</p>
               <p>In 1264, this <hi>John de Veſey</hi> was ſummoned to parliament in the 28th year of King Henry the Third's reign. This was the glorious aera in which our mode of parliaments was firſt ſettled, and Commons regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly admitted to a ſhare in the legiſlative power. He died in the 11th year of the reign of King Edward I. And in the 25th year of that reign, A. D. 1297, died <hi>William de Veſey,</hi> the laſt Baron of that family; who having no ligitimate iſſue, but leaving a ſon born out of wedlock, did, by the King's licence, enfeof <hi>Anthony Beck,</hi> Biſhop of Durham and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Patriarch of Jeruſalem, in the caſtle and Barony of Alnwick, in truſt for ſuch natural ſon; but this Right Reverend Guardian got the infant deprived of his barony, and as he acquired other royal favours, alſo obtained a confirmation from the King of a ſale made thereof to Henry Lord Percy, Baron of Topcliff and Spofford, in Yorkſhire, an anceſtor of the preſent illuſtrious family.</p>
               <p>Mr Groſe ſays, but from what authority he is not pleaſed to point out, <q>that the appointment of the infant's Guardians, as alſo the very words of the deed of enfeofment (now extant) in which the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is to the Biſhop abſolute and unconditional, confute a report too haſtily taken up by ſome Hiſtorians, that this caſtle and barony were only given to the Biſhop in truſt for William the Baſtard above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and that he was guilty of a violation of this truſt in diſpoſing of them otherwiſe.</q> It would have been well if Mr Groſe could have ſhewn where this deed was to be ſeen; as it would in ſome meaſure have exonerated the Biſhop's memory of this infamous charge, and would have ſet Hiſtorians right for the future. Rymer (III. 184—18-9) au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes the contrary determination. I do not remember an inſtrument of that antiquity, which contains an expreſs truſt; but where a truſt was premiſed, it was merely confidential, or expreſſed in ſome ſeparate deed. Truſts were introduced by the Lawmen to evade the ſtatute of uſes made in the reign of King Henry VIII. and from that period gained their legal acceptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0085300202:221"/>The caſtle and barony of Alnwick continued in the Biſhop's poſſeſſion 12 years,<note n="*" place="bottom">Groſe.</note> before he granted them to Lord Percy. The Biſhop's deed bears date the 19th of Nov. 1309, and doth not indeed wear the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of an obſcure tranſaction, for the witneſſes to it were ſome of the greateſt perſonages in the kingdom, viz. Henry Lacy Earl of Lincoln, Robert de Umfreville Earl of Angus, Robert Lord Clifford, &amp;c. the grant was afterwards confirmed by the King at Sheene, 23d Jan. 1310, to H. Percy and his ſons; who Mr Groſe ſays, <q>to remove every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of complaint, obtained a releaſe of all right and title to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance from the heir at law, <hi>Sir Gilbert de Aton,</hi> Knt. who was the neareſt legitimate relation to the Lord <hi>William de Veſey</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</q> I muſt confeſs Mr Groſe's argument with me tends not to exculpate the Biſhop, but to confirm the ſuſpicion of his guilt.

               <p>The laſt remarkable incident in hiſtory relative to this caſtle, was in the reign of King Edward IV. and happened after his great victory at <hi>Towton.</hi> One <hi>Peter de Brezè,</hi> a Frenchman, being under his Sovereign's diſpleaſure, and in priſon, was reſtored to liberty on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his entering into the ſervice of the King of Sicily, the father of Margaret of Anjou, and conducting the troops raiſed for her ſervice into England. <hi>Brezè</hi> landed on the Northumberland coaſt with about 500
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0085300202:225"/>
men at arms: he poſſeſſed the caſtle of Alnwick, which was ſoon after beſieged by Lord Haſtings, Sir Ralph Gray, and Sir John Howard. The garriſon was reduced to great diſtreſs, when George Douglas, Earl of Angus, influenced to this ſervice by great promiſes from Margaret, advanced unexpectedly to the beſiegers with 10,000 horſemen, and making ſuch manoeuvres as induced the Engliſh army to apprehend he meant to attack them, whilſt they were forming themſelves in order of battle, he brought a ſtrong party up to the poſtern gate, to whom the garriſon made a ſally, and being mounted on horſes brought for that purpoſe, or behind the armed horſemen, the ſmall garriſon evacuated the fortreſs, being only 300 in number, and fled without bloodſhed. It is believed the garriſon, before they retired, endeavoured to deſtroy all the arms and ammunition they could not carry off: for a few years ago, on opening the principal well in the inner ward, which had been long filled up, the workmen found in it a great number of cannon balls of a large ſize, ſuch as were chiefly uſed after the firſt invention of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder.</p>
               <p>Margaret, in the month of October following, making another ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, by the treachery of Sir Ralph Gray, the Governor, was again put in poſſeſſion of <hi>Alnwick Caſtle:</hi> but King Edward ſoon approaching with a numerous army, and finding no forces in the field to oppoſe him, Margaret having again retired into Scotland, he laid ſiege to the three great fortreſſes of <hi>Alnwick, Dunſtanborough,</hi> and <hi>Bambrough,</hi> at the ſame time. The troops which inveſted <hi>Alnwick,</hi> being 10,000 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were under the command of the Earl of Warwick, the Earl of Kent, the Lord Powis, the Baron of Grayſtock, and Lord Cromwell. <hi>Alnwick</hi> held out till the 6th of January; the French General <hi>Brezé</hi> having made an ineffectual effort to relieve it.</p>
               <p>I muſt treſpaſs upon the reader ſo far, as to introduce in this place a ſhort account of <hi>the illuſtrious family of Percy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This family is deſcended from <hi>Mainfred de Percy,</hi> who came into <hi>Normandy</hi> from <hi>Denmark,</hi> before the adventure of the famous <hi>Rollo,</hi> and had iſſue <hi>Geffrey,</hi> who took part with <hi>Rollo</hi> in his expedition into that province, of which he obtained the Sovereignty; being the firſt Duke of that country, and lineal anceſtor to <hi>William Duke of Normandy</hi> and King of England. <hi>Glover</hi> the <hi>Somerſet Herald</hi> in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, ſet forth this as an undoubted genealogy of the family.</p>

before he had compleated the ninth month of his age. In the 20th of the ſame reign, he was retained Governor of the town and caſtle of <hi>Berwick,</hi> with the Eaſt Marches of Scotland.

               <p>The ſixth Earl <hi>Henry</hi> was deeply in love with the fair <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> but by the art of Cardinal Woolſey, and even the royal interpoſition, was withdrawn from an attachment, which it is ſaid gave great anxiety to the Sovereign.

He commanded againſt the Scots who made an incurſion the ſame year, and giving them battle near <hi>Cheviot,</hi> obtained a compleat victory: Sir John Forſter was ſhot through the mouth, and had his horſe killed under him.

It would be inconſiſtent with my plan, in this place to ſpeak upon that matter; it will ſuffice to add, that the Earl having fled into Scotland, was betrayed and delivered up, and in the 13th year of Queen Elizabeth, he and his Counteſs were convicted of high treaſon and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed;

Mr Nathaniel Torporley, a noted Mathematician, being made known to the great Earl of Northumberland, Henry Percy, the generous favourer of all good learning, was received into his patronage, and had a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion paid yearly unto him, ſeveral years from his purſe. Thomas Hariot went in 1584, with Sir Walter Raleigh to Virginia, where he was employed in the diſcovery and ſurveying thereof. After his return into England, Sir Walter got him into the acquaintance of that noble and generous Earl, who finding him a gentleman of an affable and peaceable nature, and well read in the obſcure parts of learning, he did allow him a yearly penſion of 120l. About the ſame time Robert Hues and Walter Warner, two other Mathematicians, who were known alſo to the ſaid Earl, did receive of him yearly penſions alſo, but of leſs value; as did Torperley. So that when the ſaid Earl was committed priſoner to the tower, in 1606, Hariot, Hues, and Warner, were his conſtant companions, and were uſually called the Earl of Northumberland's 3 <hi>Magi.</hi> They had a table at the Earl's charge, and the Earl did conſtantly converſe with them and with Sir Walter Raleigh then in the tower.</q>

                           <p>I had lately an account from Alnwick, of ſome braſs weapons found there by a maſon as he was clearing the earth from a rock about a mile N. W. from that place, within the old park,
<figure/>
to get up ſome ſtone. After having dug about half a yard deep in the ground, he came to 20 ſword blades, and 16 ſpear heads lying cloſe to the top of the rock, without any caſe or cover than the ſoil. The ſwords were exactly of the ſame ſhape as thoſe in the 51ſt plate of Mr Gordon's book. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, 3, and 17 or 18 inches long. Some of the ſpears reſembled 4 and 5 in the ſame, but others were broader and cut thro' as in the margin. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging about a foot lower on the hill ſide, he found 42 braſs wedges or chiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels, with a ring near their thicker end, of which I doubt not, but you have ſeen many, and ſo need not give you any deſcription of them, but that they are not unlike N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4 in Mr Gordon's 50th plate. How and for what they were uſed, I will not take upon me to determine abſolutely, but by their edges which are much broken and battered, they ſeem to have been employed as chizzels for cutting ſtone. I believe they put a wooden ſhaft in the hollow end of them, and ſo drove them with a mallet.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Laurence's Syſtem of Agriculture and Gardening, where he mentions ſome of theſe found in the ſmall joints and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The ſhaft when not employed might be drawn out of the chizzel, and by running a ſtring thro' the ring on their ſides, ſeveral of them might be tied together, and conveniently carried by the workman at his girdle, or otherwiſe, and one ſhaft ſerve them all. About eight years ago near a buſhel of them were found at Cave, upon the banks of the Humber in Yorkſhire, under a little Tumulus by the highway ſide; and what is very remarkable, every one of them was encloſed in a matrix of the ſame metal, or caſe, fitting it ſo exactly, that it ſeemed to be caſt in it, and ſo freſh and whole were the edges of them, all as if they had never been uſed.</p>

So many of theſe braſs chizzels have been found in this iſland, and ſo few any where elſe, and thoſe only in France, that they ſeem almoſt to have been the peculiar tools of the Britons; their near alliance and intercourſe with the Gauls eaſily accounting why they have been ſometimes diſcovered in the antient ſeat of the latter. The ſwords and ſpear heads afore-mentioned being found ſo near theſe chizzels, and of the very ſame metal, is an argument that they belonged to the ſame people, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think to have been Romans, who, as I formerly ventured to give you my opinion, ſeem to have left off the uſe of braſs in their weapons, before their arrival in this iſland.

                           <p>I return you thanks for the account you ſent me of the Antiquities found at Alnwick, their number ſurpriſed me much. Some of the ſame kind have been found here in Cairns, nothing in Antiquity is more myſterious than the uſe of theſe Inſtruments of braſs, which reſemble ſmall hatchets or chiſſels. I incline to think them warlike inſtruments, as we generally take the ſtone hatchets to be: I have 3 or 4 of both kinds. When they came firſt into my hands, I ſet about reading ſuch accounts as had been given of them, and found that one Mr Hearne had taken a good deal of pains to prove they were Roman. His diſſertation is printed in Mott's Collection of the Tranſactions of the Royal Society, v. 2. part 4. p. 70. But I cannot be of that gentleman's opinion. The Romans underſtood better the expeditious ways of doing things, than to make uſe of ſuch ſlight and brittle tools: We muſt then aſcribe them to the ancient Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons who uſed inſtruments of braſs before iron came to take place: What makes me judge they were not chiſſels, is, that the Britons made very little uſe of hewn <note n="*" place="bottom">The Stones at Stonehenge are hewen.</note> ſtone, and for that reaſon little or nothing of their ſtone monuments does remain. It is indeed probable they made uſe of them for repairing their highways, for all ſuch inſtruments found here were in Cairns<note n="†" place="bottom">

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0085300202:254"/>
curious is not excluded from thoſe beautiful ſcenes. The way to <hi>Huln</hi> forms one of the ſweeteſt and moſt romantic rides in the county; where nature has left the lands open, art has happily diſpoſed her works with the juſteſt taſte, to ſupply the vacancy. The entrance is by a ſteep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent to the vale, through which the river winds its courſe. The road by traverſing the hills obliquely, renders the way eaſy to the paſſenger: it is cloathed on each hand with plantations of various kinds of foreſt trees, mingled with great judgment, and ſo diſpoſed, that the pines and evergreens give an agreeable variegation of colour in the foliage, without deadening the ſcene. Nothing can be more gloomy than long-extended lines of duſky firs, which, as the Poet <note n="*" place="bottom">Maſon.</note> juſtly obſerves, <q>blot the horizon.</q> Theſe plantations are bordered on each ſide of the road with a variety of flowering ſhrubs and tufts of flowers. After paſſing this agreeable grove by irregular windings, we deſcended into a plain waſhed by the ſolemn ſtream of ſleepy <hi>Aln,</hi> which ſcarce appears to flow, ſo dull it ſeems, in this romantic valley, ſhut in on every hand by lofty eminences, covered with wood, forming a ſpacious theatre near two miles in circuit. On the right hand the river forms a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, the oppoſite ſhore compoſed of ſhaken and perpendicular rocks, over whoſe brink impends a foreſt of oaks, riſing ſhade above ſhade up to the crown of the mountains. As the <hi>Aln</hi> paſſes away from this ſweet vale, and glides from under the feet of thoſe romantic rocks, ſhe doth not even yield a murmur or a ſigh; except where conſtrained by ſome artificial wears, ſhe turns over with indolence, and falls again to ſleep on the ſucceeding lake.</p>
               <p>After paſſing this plain, the vale grows narrow, the hills and woods are loftier, and the river here and there frets over a few pebbles which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede her paſſage. Here is every ſylvan beauty; here we taſted enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the pleaſures of a woody ſcene—the richneſs of the foreſt hues, the deep ſhadow, and the refreſhing breeze perfumed by wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine—together with that ſolemnity and ſtillneſs which ſooth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative mind.</p>

which, on the right, on a graſſy eminence, ſtand the remains of the monaſtery, humbly mourning in the lowly garb of ſolitude, and bending down in ruins: over which a tower of the Percys bears the melancholy air of unavailing defence, and overlooks the mouldering walls with an aſpect of deſpondency, in its inability to ſhield off the ſtrokes of time and devaſtation. We aſcended to the ſummit of the hill, and being poſſeſſed of the keys, by which alone we could have had acceſs to theſe retreats, we flattered ourſelves no obſtacle could ariſe that might deprive us of the ſight of the ruins of this religious houſe, and every thing curious there; but the whole is encloſed with a lofty wall, the interior ground being diſpoſed in gardening: we found the keeper of this place a little man, of a mean and inſolent aſpect; he heard our requeſt with the door in his hand, after which, with a contemptuous ſilence, he walked in and turned the key againſt us, as if he was afraid we ſhould diſcover ſome theft he was committing againſt his Lord. Thus excluded and looking ridiculous enough, we could do nothing more than ride round the walls, by which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the ruins chiefly conſiſted of a ſmall chapel, wanting little beſides a roof: the tower a ſquare building, with exploratory turrets at each corner, is in good repair, fitted up as a pleaſure room, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a beautiful proſpect, as we could ſufficiently judge from our lower ſituation.</p>
               <p>The view from this eminence into the vale which we had paſſed, was ſingularly beautiful: the ragged, rocky, and barren mountain, which now lay on our right, afforded a bold contraſt to the hanging foreſts and the planted eminences which interſected the winding val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley: the Aln was ſeen in meanders down the nearer and narrow dell, and in the extended diſtant plain the waters formed a fine lucid creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, the canal being then happily touched by the ſun's beams; the heights cloathed with oaks, the lower hills girt with plantations of various hues, the bold rocks puſhing forth their fronts from out the wood, all mingled with that irregularity and wildneſs nature alone can diſplay in theſe hilly countries, formed this beautiful landſkip.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Hulne</hi> was the firſt monaſtery of Carmelite Friars in this kingdom. The account of its foundation is thus given by ancient writers: Among the Britiſh Barons who went to the Holy Wars in the reign of King Henry III. were William de Veſey Lord of Alnwick, and Richard Gray, two eminent chieftains in the chriſtian army: led by curioſity or devotion, they went to viſit the Monks of Mount Carmel, and there unexpectedly found a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of their own, one Ralph Freſborn, a Northumberland-man, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in a former cruſade; and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a vow had afterwards taken upon him the monaſtic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in that ſolitude. When Veſey and Gray returned to England, they ſtrongly importuned the ſuperior of the Carmelites to let their countryman accompany them home; which was at length granted, upon condition that they would found a monaſtery for Carmelites in their own country. Soon after their return, Freſborn, mindful of their engagement, began to look out for a place for their Convent. After examining all the circumjacent ſolitudes, he at length fixed upon the preſent ſpot, induced, it is ſaid, by the great reſemblance which the adjoining hill bore to Mount Carmel: and indeed whoever looks into Maundril's travels, will find that the draught of that mountain, given in his book, bears a ſtrong likeneſs to this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The above William de Veſey gave a grant of the ground, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twelve or thirteen acres, in his park of Holne; but Freſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born is ſaid to have erected the building himſelf. The foundation was laid about A. D. 1240, and Freſborn gathering a proper number of Monks, became the firſt Abbot of the Order; and having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided here with great reputation of ſanctity, at length died, and was buried in the monaſtery about the year 1274.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The original grant of William de Veſey, was confirmed by his ſucceſſors Veſeys; and by the Percies, after their becoming proprietors of Alnwick: many additional privileges and immunities were added by the ſucceeding grants, particulariſed in Mr Groſe's work, but too

                  <figDesc>depiction of Alnwick Abbey gateway</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p>There are no remains of the <hi>Abbey,</hi> but a <hi>Gateway and Tower,</hi> which by the architecture and arms ſculptured upon the building, ſhew it is of much more modern date than the foundation of the houſe. This tower is not ſquare, but oblong, having an exploratory turret on each corner. The north ſide is ornamented with a nich, canopy'd, capable of receiving a ſtatue five feet high: moſt probable it contained the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the dedicatory Virgin. Beneath is a figure of an angel in relief, with expanded wings. Over this entrance are ſhields of arms, a croſs, ſuppoſed to be the arms of the Veſeys, and a croſs molin. On the ſouth ſide, in a nich, is the figure of one of the Religious, of the order of White Friars of Premonſtratenſes, in his proper habilament, in pretty good preſervation. This front is ornamented with ſhields of arms, the arms of Brabant adopted by the Percys, with the arms of Lucys quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, the principal; and alſo the arms of Veſey.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0085300202:262"/>A gate opens to the eaſt, on each ſide of which are the figures of cherubs ſupporting armorial ſhields: on this front is alſo a canopy and nich for a ſtatue. Here are the arms of Brabant and the arms of Lucys on ſeparate ſhields. At this entrance, as alſo on the north ſide, were machicolations; and in the center of the arching of the gateway is a ſquare aperture, from whence the poſſeſſors could annoy aſſailants. The maſonry of this tower is excellent; the gates of lattice braced with iron ſtill remain.</p>
               <p>Above the gate going into the court of the houſe, is an eſcutcheon of white marble, much injured by the weather, but retaining ſome marks of the Sculptor, to diſtinguiſh that it once contained the creſt of the Doubledays, an arm in armour ſuſpending a mullet. The antiquity of this piece has been much doubted, but the materials determine that point clearly.</p>
               <p>This ſeat of <hi>the Doubleday family</hi> has nothing very ſingular to mark it, but the beauty of the retirement, under the hanging woods of the river Aln. The ground plot of the religious houſe is now included in the orchard; the ruins of which probably afforded materials for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent manſion; but there are not the leaſt remains to denote the exact ſcite of the monaſtic buildings, or the place of interment of the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſonages before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Solemn ſituations like this, and the ruins of religious houſes, always affect my mind with a degree of languiſhment. Such a ſecluſion, ſuch a retirement, would have filled my wiſh. The life of the Eccleſiaſtic is moſt deſirable, and ſeems calculated to be the happieſt. No natural tendency to indolence and eaſe prompts this determination; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of a Churchman's life, under the entire precluſion of all worldly concerns, affords that tranquillity of mind, ſo neceſſary to contemplation and ſtudy, to philoſophic reſearches, and divine meditation—without the poiſon of ambition, ſome minds can enjoy a mediocrity with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent—without an impertinent wiſh to intermeddle with public affairs, ſome men can ſit within the little manſion, buſied only in pious duties and contemplations; and amidſt domeſtic peace, living each day, in gratitude for the enjoyment of the rural beauties of ſome ſylvan ſcene, the plain, the mead, the grotto, and the ſtream—call it luxury: but the buſy world inceſſantly rolls the heavy wheels of care too near my threſhold—I am frequently induced to adopt Horace's deſcription:

               <p>This was a dependent manor of the barony of Alnwick. The town is ſmall, but carries on a conſiderable trade in the export of corn and other produce of the country.

                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0085300202:265"/>An account of this place, publiſhed in the Newcaſtle Courant in the year 1772, contains the following particulars: <q>It is about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a mile from the ſea. The principal ſtreet ſtands upon a riſing ground, at the higher end of which, upon an eminence, are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of an ancient caſtle. The market place is in the middle of the town, where is a fine ſtone croſs on a ſpacious area at the meeting of two ſtreets, the one leading to the church, which is an elegant ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe ſpire is upwards 100 feet high; the other to the bridge, where is an ancient tower. Contiguous to the bridge is a large free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone quarry, the ſtones of which are ſo much eſteemed, that great quantities thereof are ſhipped for London. The ſalmon fiſhery here is carried to a very great extent, ſo that at the mouth of the Coquet, in the ſummer ſeaſon, as well as in the river itſelf, are ſome thouſands caught, which gives employment to a number of hands. The river, which almoſt ſurrounds the town, directs its courſe in a ſtraight line for about half a mile, then leaving the fine and pleaſant villas of Gloſterhill and Amble on its ſouthern banks, while it loſes itſelf in the ocean. In the year 1764, it left its old courſe, and forced its way between two ſandy hills overgrown with bent, that had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed its paſſage for ages, and is now ſettled in a very deep channel, with a fine clay bottom, which makes it navigable for ſmall craft. It is ſaid there is upwards of 14 feet of water upon the bar at full ſea, and continues that depth very near the town; ſo that with a little aſſiſtance of art, it might be made to admit ſhips of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable burthen; and as Coquet Iſland is ſituated a little to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, forms a fine bay at the very mouth of the river. The grounds adjoining thereto abound with a fine ſeam of coal; and ſo plentiful is corn, that few counties can equal its fertility. From theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, what pity it is that Warkworth was not made a ſea-port, ſince nature has almoſt half finiſhed the deſign.</q>

                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0085300202:266"/>The caſtle ſtands on the crown of a rock, of an oblong figure; the great tower to the north, placed on the brink of the cliff above the town, is of fine architecture in chiſel-work, of a ſingular figure, being octangular, and from the center of four oppoſite ſides, a turret projects, of a ſemi-hexagonal form; from the middle of the building a very lofty exploratory turret ariſes. This part of the caſtle owes its origin to the <hi>Percys,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Lion of Brabant</hi> above the gate, and the arms diſperſed over the building. The weſtern ſide is formed of various irregular towers and walling of different ages, extending along the brink of the cliff, whoſe foot is waſhed by the river <hi>Coquet.</hi> On the ſouth, the ground riſes gradually to the height of the rocks on which the weſtern buildings are founded. This ſide of the caſtle fronts to a ſpacious plain or platform, and is defended by a high wall with an outward moat. The ancient gateway and chief entrance to the caſtle is on this ſide; the gate defended by circular towers and a draw bridge. The eaſtern ſide is placed on the brink of a ſteep declivity, defended by an outward moat, and a lofty wall guarded by a ſquare baſtion near the center, and an angular tower at the ſouth point. The walls encloſe a ſpacious area, almoſt ſquare, within which the ancient parts of the fortreſs are very ruinous.</p>
               <p>The view from hence is ſo extenſive and various, that deſcription can carry but a very imperfect idea of its members or its beauties: to the eaſt and north-eaſt, there is a ſea proſpect, with which you take in all the ſhore we had traverſed, with <hi>Dunſtanbrough</hi> and <hi>Bambrough Caſtles</hi> at the moſt diſtant point of land: the <hi>Farn Iſlands</hi> lie ſcattered like patches on the face of the waters. The port of <hi>Alemouth</hi> is a nearer object, and at a little diſtance the mouth of the river <hi>Coquet</hi> and <hi>Coquet Iſland</hi> with its ruined monaſtery are ſeen. To the north, you view a rich cultivated country to <hi>Alnwick;</hi> weſtward, the banks of <hi>Coquet</hi> river, graced with little woodlands, which here and there impend on its winding channel; to the ſouth, you view an extenſive plain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining towards the ſea, crowded with villages, and interſperſed with woods; the ſhore indented by many little ports and creeks; the higher grounds are ſcattered over with innumerable hamlets, churches, and other buildings, mingling with a variety highly pleaſing; whilſt on the extreme diſtance, the different teints of the landſkip, ariſing from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious objects, require colours to convey their picture to the mind.</p>
               <p>Mr Groſe, who has given two views of this caſtle in his excellent work, ſays, <q>nothing can be more magnificent and pictureſque, from
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0085300202:267"/>
what part ſoever it is viewed; and though when entire it was far from being deſtitute of ſtrength, yet its appearance does not excite the idea of one of thoſe rugged fortreſſes deſtined ſolely for war, whoſe gloomy towers ſuggeſt to the imagination only dungeons, chains, and executions: but rather that of ſuch an ancient hoſpitable manſion as is alluded to by Milton,</q>

               <p>
                  <q>The caſtle and mote, according to an ancient ſurvey, contained 5 acres 17¾ perches of ground. Its walls on the ſouth, eaſt, and weſt ſides are garniſhed with towers.

                  <q>The keep or dungeon forms the north front; its figure is a ſquare with the angles canted off. Near the middle of each face of this ſquare there is a turret, projecting at right angles, its end terminating in a ſemi-hexagon: theſe projections are of the ſame height as the reſt of the keep. This keep is very large and lofty, and contains a variety of magnificent apartments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr Groſe gives the copy of a ſurvey taken of this caſtle in 1567, of which ſome extracts may be pertinent here. <q>The Buyldinge of the ſayd caſtell on the ſowth parte is thre towres, viz. the Gatehouſe towre in the middle thereof, which ys the entrye at a draw bridge over drye moyte; and in the ſame toure ys a priſon and porter lodge, and over the ſame a fare lodging, called the conſtables lodgings; and in the curtayne is a fayre and comely building, a chapel, and divers houſes of office, and above the great chambre and the Lordes lodginge. On the weſt ſide, the poſterne towre, and the old hall, which was very fare at the entrye into the hall, for the porche thereof is rayſed a little ſquare towre, wherein is two chambres; and on the foreſyd, in ſtone, portrayed a lyon, verie workmanly wrought, and therefore called the lyon towre. In the eaſte ſyde of the great hall, was an ile ſet owt, with pyllers, which yet ſtandeth. The doungion is in the northe parte of the ſcyte of the ſayd Caſtell, ſet upon a little mount highyer than the reſt of the cowrte; ſteppes of a greas before ye enter to yt: and the ſame ys buyld as a foure ſquare, and owt of every ſquare one towre; all which be ſo quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

lofty perpendicular rocks on the other hand confining the walk to about the width of four feet. From the ſummit of the cliffs a grove
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0085300202:270"/>
of oaks is ſuſpended, giving a ſolemn ſhade; and at their feet iſſues a ſpring of the pureſt water, which formerly ſupplied the Recluſe. The ſteps, veſtibule, and chief apartments of the Hermitage, are hewn out of the boſom of a free-ſtone rock, whoſe outſide face is about 20 feet high, embowered with ſtately trees, which impend from the top of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice and fiſſures of the cliffs. One lower and outward apartment is of maſonry. We entered into this lower apartment by a paſſage of three paces, the doorway marked with the remains of bolts and iron hinges: it is built up againſt the ſide of the rock, about 18 feet ſquare, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been the kitchen or principal dwelling, having a range or fire-place ſix feet wide. On the ſouth ſide of this apartment, oppoſite to our entrance, is a doorway leading to an outward ſeat formed in the rock, and opening upon the walk on the river's brink. On this ſide
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0085300202:271"/>
of the room are two windows, which bear the marks of iron-grating, and alſo a cloſet. By holes cut in the rock, it ſeems as if timbers had been lodged therein for the flooring of an upper chamber. This ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is built of aſhler-work, and appeared to us of much more modern date than the cells formed in the rock. Paſſing from this outward build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way we entered, we aſcended by 17 ſteps to a little veſtibule, with a ſeat on each ſide capable of holding one perſon only. Above the inner doorway ſome letters appear, the remains of a phraſe which may be thus rendered in Engliſh: <hi>"My tears have been my food day and night."</hi> From thence we entered the principal apartment or <hi>chapel,</hi> about 18 feet in length, and not more than ſeven feet and an half wide, and of the ſame height. Two pilaſters of ſemi-hexagonal form project from the oppoſite walls in the center, and one from each corner, from whence ſpring the interſecting groins of the roof, the joinings ornamented with roſes. The pilaſters have plain capitals and baſes, in the old Gothic ſtile. All the work is chiſelled, and done with mechanic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and regularity: the wall or outſide rock as you enter is left ſo thick, as to admit the veſtibule before deſcribed. At the eaſt end is an altar, formed croſs the whole apartment, aſcended by two ſteps; the upper plane edged with a moulding. In the center of the wall behind is a nich for a crucifix or image, with the remains of a glory. On the

right hand as you approach the altar, cut out of the thickneſs of the wall, is a nich or cavity, like thoſe often deſcribed in the progreſs of this work, left in the walls of the ailes of churches; within which there is repreſented a table monument (no chink or cavity appearing, to give a ſuppoſition that it is hollowed to receive any human remains) with a recumbent female figure,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Wallis's deſcription is in the following words. <q>In the fole of a window, at the ſouth end of the altar, is the effigies of the bleſſed Virgin, ſculptured in ſtone, recumbent; another of the child Jeſus on her right hand, ſtanding, his left reſted upon her ſhoulder; at her feet, in a nich in the wall, is the effigies of an Hermit, in the attitude of prayer.</q> Mr Wallis is in an error here, for the female recumbent figure, having its head towards the eaſt, lays with the right hand to the chapel: if any figure has ſtood on the ſide of the effigies, it muſt have been againſt the pillar which divides the windows. There is an abſurdity in the idea of <hi>the boy Jeſus ſtanding over the tomb of the Virgin Mary,</hi> that need not be dwelt upon.</note> the hands and arms of which appear to have been elivated. Light is admitted by two ſmall windows behind. On the pillar which divides the windows, are the remains of ſome ſculpture, ſuppoſed by many to be that of an hovering cherub; but with the utmoſt attention, and a ſtrong deſire to coincide with others, I could not ſee any ſuch figure, even with an eye prejudiced by ſuch prepoſſeſſions:<note n="†" place="bottom">

At the foot of the recumbent effigies is a baſon cut
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0085300202:273"/>
for holy water, and the feet of the effigies reſt againſt an animal (moſt likely a dog, as an emblem of fidelity) as is uſual on monuments of the like form. I pay great deference to the opinions of other viſitants, but cannot agree with the author of the poem, that this is a bull's head, or the uſual place for creſts: on the contrary, according to the virtues of the deceaſed, ancient tombs are decorated with an animal at the foot of the effigies, as a lion for fortitude, a dog for fidelity, &amp;c. and this ſame figure appeared to me no other than that of a crouching dog; as is to be ſeen on multitudes of ancient tombs. The uſual place of the creſt on tombs, is under the head of the effigies. The examples in the northern counties are moſt likely to point out to us the prevailing faſhion. The bull's head is in that poſition on the tombs of the family of Nevils, in Brancepeth and Staindrop churches, in the county of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; and a dog lays at the feet. The ſame on the fine tomb of Ogle, in Bothal church, and alſo the Ram's head on the elegant tomb of Gray, at Chillingham, with many other inſtances in Northumberland. Under the head of the effigies no creſt appears; a double cuſhion is the ſupport. By length of time, and the weather beating through the windows, the figures are greatly injured. In a nich at the foot of the monument, and cut in the wall, is the figure of an Hermit on his knees, reſting his head on his right hand, and his left hand placed on his boſom, as in a lamenting or penſive poſture. The author of the poem has racked invention to conceive a cauſe for our Hermit's vow of ſeverity and retirement.</p>

                     <l>In days of youthful fame;</l>
                     <l>Yon diſtant hills were his domains;</l>
                     <l>Sir Bertram <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>From the advertiſement to the Poem.</p>
                           <p>About a mile from the caſtle, in a deep romantic valley, are the remains of a hermitage; of which the chapel is ſtill entire. This is hollowed with great elegance, in a cliff near the river; as are alſo two adjoining apartments, which probably ſerved for the ſacriſty and veſtry, or were appropriated to ſome other ſacred uſes: for the former of theſe, which runs parallel with the chapel, appears to have had an alter in it, at which maſs was occaſionly celebrated, as well as in the chapel itſelf.</p>
                           <p>Each of theſe apartments is extremely ſmall; for that which was the principal chapel does not in length exceed 18 feet, nor is more than 7½ feet in breadth and height: it is, however, very beautifully deſigned and executed, in the ſolid rock; and has all the decorations of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Gothic church or cathedral in miniature.</p>
                           <p>But what principally diſtinguiſhes the chapel, is a ſmall tomb or monument on the ſouth ſide of the altar; on the top of which lies a female figure, extended in the manner that effigies are uſually exhibited praying on ancient tombs. This figure, which is very delicately deſigned, ſome have ignorantly called an image of the Virgin Mary, though it has not the leaſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the manner in which ſhe is repreſented in the Romiſh churches; who is uſually erect, as the object of adoration, and never in a proſtrate or recumbent poſture. Indeed the real image of the bleſſed Virgin probably ſtood in a ſmall nich, ſtill viſible behind the altar: whereas the figure of a bull's head, which is rudely carved at this lady's feet, the uſual place for the creſt in old monuments, plainly proves her to have been a very different perſonage.</p>
                           <p>About the tomb are ſeveral other figures, which, as well as the principal one above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are cut in the natural rock, in the ſame manner as the little chapel itſelf, with all its ornaments, and the two adjoining apartments. What ſlight traditions are ſcattered through the country, concerning the origin and foundation of this hermitage, tomb, &amp;c. are delivered to the reader in the following rhimes.</p>
                           <p>It is univerſally agreed, that the founder was one of the Bertram family, which had once conſiderable poſſeſſions in Northumberland, and were anciently Lords of Bothal caſtle, ſituate about ten miles from Warkworth. He has been thought to be the ſame Bertram that endowed Brinkburn Priory, and built Brenkſhaw chapel; which both ſtand in the ſame winding valley, higher up the river.</p>
                           <p>But Brinkburn Priory was founded in the reign of King Henry I. whereas the form of the Gothick windows in this chapel, eſpecially of thoſe near the altar, is found rather to reſemble the ſtile of architecture that prevailed about the reign of King Edward III. and indeed that the ſculpture in this chapel cannot be much older, appears from the creſt which is placed at the lady's feet on the tomb; for Camden informs us, that armorial creſts did not become here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary till about the reign of King Edward II.</p>

               <p>In Mr Groſe's account of this Hermitage, it is alledged, that it was univerſally believed the firſt Hermit enjoined himſelf this life of pennance and ſeverity, in contrition for the murder of his own brother. I muſt ſay, I was ſtruck with an idea on my firſt entrance, which grew upon me whilſt I remained in theſe ſacred vaults, and drew on a train of penſive thoughts: There needed nothing barbarous, ſavage, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous to induce a man to ſuch a life—diſappointed love was ſufficient of itſelf to incite it: Conceive the perſonage ſculptured upon the tomb or monument, to be the devoted bride or beloved wife of the Recluſe, cut off in the prime of life by ſome common caſualty, perhaps after a ſhort life of harmony and love in the marriage ſtate, in the inſtant of bringing into the world the iſſue of an happy intercourſe, and the heir of an opulent race—this was cauſe ſufficient. Under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we ſhould entertain more feelings for the tender ſorrows and diſappointed love of the Hermit, than we can experience when we ſee him ſtained with bloody crimes, ariſing from wrath, revenge, raſhneſs, or indiſcretion—mad with jealouſy, even to ſuch a blindneſs, that he could not know his own brother, though gone forth in diſguiſe at his inſtance on the ſame errand with himſelf. I own my ideas furniſhed me with a very different picture of the Hermit's woes—I ſtood over the monument with an eye flooded in tears, and a mind diſtreſſed by the tendereſt touches of commiſeration. After muſing for ſome time, I imagined I could hear the diſtreſſed inhabitant exclaim: <q>In the duſt reſts for ever the beloved remains of the beſt of women—united to me by love and wedloc—the hopes of my youth, the joy of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and the felicity of my poſſeſſion; with her I had flattered my mind, life would paſs away ſerenely, and the evening of the human day advance in peace: but alas! when my happineſs was at its height, ſhe was ſnatched from me, and forlornneſs beſet my ſteps.</q>

He had in marriage, as a royal ward, Sibel, the daughter and heireſs of the Mitford family. Sir William his ſon obtained his poſſeſſions of Mitford to be created a Barony by King Henry I. He married Alice the daughter of Sir William Merley, by whom he had iſſue two ſons.

               <p>On the left hand of the altar, a window is formed in the partition of the apartments, divided by two mullions, the ſummit of each light or diviſion ornamented with work formed of ſections of circles, like thoſe ſeen in cathedrals of the tenth century. From the chapel we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered an inner apartment, by a neat door-caſe, over which is ſculptured a ſhield, with the crucifixion and ſeveral inſtruments of torture. At the eaſt end of this inner apartment, is an altar like that in the chapel, lighted by the laſt-deſcribed window, and through which the perſon kneeling at the inner altar, could view the cenotaph in the chapel: this apartment is about five feet wide and nine paces in length: here is alſo a nich or baſon for holy water. On the northern ſide of this inner chamber, a receſs is cut in the rock, of ſize ſufficient to hold the couch of a perſon of middling ſtature. I have ſeen ſeveral of the like form, alcoved above, and a ſole about two feet above the level of the floor to hold the matraſs and bedding of the Recluſe. This receſs is ſo placed, that whilſt I ſat therein to make my notes, by a nich cut ſlantwiſe in the partition wall which ſeparates the two apartments, I had a view of the cenotaph and effigies thereon. The nich ſeemed calculated for this very purpoſe; being cut through the wall aſſant, it could not be conceived intended to convey the light. By ſome it has been imagined to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for confeſſion, but it is my ſentiment that the Hermit was prieſt and penitent in one; and that he had deviſed thoſe apertures, that the effigies ſhould be conſtantly in his ſight. In this inner apartment, is a ſmall cloſet cut in the ſide wall to the north: from this interior cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is a doorway leading to an open gallery, having a proſpect up the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0085300202:283"/>
river; but by the falling of ſome of the rock above, this part is greatly damaged. It is ſaid by old people, that the roof was ſupported by a fine pillar, and formed a ſmall piazza cloiſter or open gallery—ſuch galleries are ſeen in very ancient manſions, in the centre of the front: one is yet perfect in the remains of Bradley Hall, in the county of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the manſion of the eldeſt branch of the family of Bowes, built, as it is preſumed, ſoon after the conqueſt.</p>
               <p>From theſe cells, through a neat doorway, there are winding ſtairs cut in the rock, leading to its ſummit, ſuppoſed to conduct to the Hermit's olatory or garden. A channel is ingeniouſly formed on the ſteps to carry off the water.</p>
               <p>It ſeems evident that the original hermitage conſiſted of no more than the apartments hewn in the rock, the inner one being the dwelling-place, and the little cloiſter the ſummer ſeat, facing weſtward, and commanding a beautiful view up the river Coquet, which here forms a fine curve, in extent near half a mile, on this ſide bordered by rocks, on the other by cultivated lands, of an eaſy inclination; on the extremity ſtands a pretty farmhold, to terminate the ſequeſtered rural proſpect. The ſtyle of architecture adopted in this hermitage is of the Saxon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic, which proves its antiquity. In the poſtſcript to the <hi>poem</hi> of the Hermit of Warkworth, the author aſſerts, <q>that the memory of the firſt Hermit was held in ſuch regard and veneration by the <hi>Percy</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that they afterwards maintained a chantry prieſt, to reſide in the hermitage and celebrate maſs in the chapel; whoſe allowance, uncommonly liberal and munificent, was continued down to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the monaſteries; and then the whole ſalary, together with the hermitage and all its dependencies, reverted back to the family; having never been endowed in mortmain. On this account we have no record which fixes the date of the foundation, or gives any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of the firſt Hermit.</q> The patent is extant, which was granted to the laſt Hermit in 1532, by the ſixth Earl of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.<note n="*" place="bottom">Henry Earl of Northumberland, &amp;c.

of the above patent, it will perhaps be needleſs to caution the reader againſt a miſtake ſome have fallen into, of confounding the hermitage near Warkworth, with a chantry founded within the town itſelf, by Nicholas de Farnham, Biſhop of Durham, in the reign of King Henry III. who appropriated the church of Branxton for the maintenance there of two Benedictine Monks from Durham. That ſmall monaſtic foundation is indeed called a cell by Biſhop Tanner; but he muſt be very ignorant, who ſuppoſes that by the word cell, is neceſſary to be underſtood a hermitage; whereas it was commonly applied to any ſmall conventual eſtabliſhment, which was dependant on another. As to the chapel belonging to this endowment of Biſhop Farnham, it is mentioned as in ruins in ſeveral old ſurveys of Queen Elizabeth's time; and its ſcite not far from Warkworth church, is ſtill remembered.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note> But that there was never more than one prieſt maintained, at one and the ſame time, within the hermitage, is plainly proved, (if any further proof be wanting) by the following extract from a ſurvey of Warkworth, made in the year 1567, viz. Ther is in the parke alſo one howſe hewyn within one cragge, which is called the harmitage chapel: in the ſame ther haith bene one preaſt keaped, which did ſuch godlye ſervices as that tyme was uſed and celebrated.

The walls are almoſt entire; the great tower is very perfect: there are ſome remains of the dormitory, now converted into a cellar. Mr Groſe obſerves, that <q>theſe ruins exhibit one among the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein circular and pointed arches occur in the ſame build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that in parts manifeſtly conſtructed at the ſame time; which ſhews, that about the period of its erection, there was a kind of ſtruggle between the ancient mode or Saxon, and what is called Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic architecture; in which neither ſtyle then thoroughly prevailed. The upper range of windows in this church are all circular; thoſe immediately under them are pointed. Two doors, one on the north, the other on the ſouth, have circular arches, (of various members, falling back, ſupported on pilaſters) richly adorned with variety of Saxon ornaments, particularly that on the north, which has among others the heads of animals. Theſe are generally deemed the moſt ancient decorations of that ſtyle. The great tower has four pointed arches, and others of the ſame ſhape are ſupported by maſſy octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal pillars in the body of the church. There have been burials here as late as the year 1745. At the eaſt end, and in the north and ſouth croſſes, were chapels; in one of which are divers fragments of coffins and human bones. On the whole, though this building, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept about the doors, is remarkably plain, it has a ſober and ſolemn majeſty, not always found in buildings more highly decorated. Part of this, perhaps, it may owe to its romantic ſituation, which is the moſt proper in the world for retirement and meditation. Near the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt

                  <hi>This priory</hi> was founded by Oſbertus Colutarius, under the grant of Sir William Bertram, for Black Canons, or Canons regular of St. Auſtin, in the reign of King Henry I. and by him and his heir richly endowed.<note n="*" place="bottom">

MITFORD,</head>

The principal part of this fortreſs conſiſted of <hi>a circular tower</hi> raiſed upon an artificial mount, the chief elevation from the natural level being effected by arches of ſtone and vaults, which in ancient times were uſed as priſons or places for concealment: the tower was defended by an outward wall, which ran parallel with it, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about 10 feet. There is a very narrow proſpect from this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, the vale is ſo ſhut in on every ſide. What other erections were

               <p>It is preſumed <hi>this caſtle</hi> was built before the conqueſt; the firſt owner and its date are not known.</p>
               <p>At the time of the conqueſt, it was the poſſeſſion of <hi>Sir John Mitford,</hi> whoſe only daughter and heir, <hi>Sibille,</hi> was given in marriage by the Conqueror to <hi>Sir Richard Bertram,</hi> a Norman Knight, by whom he had two ſons, William and Roger.</p>

                                 <p>The Chantry founded at Morpeth, was ſituated on the north eaſt of the bridge, as you enter the town, very near the ſide of the river Wanſbeck, in a beautiful vale of wood and water, as moſt of the religious houſes in the north are. It was partly pulled down at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Monaſteries, and remained in that ſituation till the 6th year of King Edward VI. when a Grammar School was founded here, and endowed with the whole eſtates, as appears by the Grant annexed. The middle area to the weſt is entire, enlarging the windows, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convenient doors, for the original entrance to the weſt, is built up with a window in the Belfrey. The north area is almoſt demoliſhed, and many houſes built out of the materials on the ground; in a yard behind theſe houſes the ground plan may be traced with the greateſt eaſe, which has been cruciform. A very handſome modern-built Chapel, for the uſe of the town, was built ſome years ago on the ſouth, and the Grammar School is kept in the weſt part, which is entire. I am well informed that ſome of the eſtates and revenues mentioned in the Grant of King Edward VI. have been alienated from the good purpoſes of the founder, are fallen at laſt into private property, and are ſo held to this day.</p>

It is placed on a lofty eminence, unaſſiſted by art; the ſouthern ſide is very ſteep, and waſhed by the river Wanſbeck; the northern ſecured by a deep valley. The tower has formerly had angular turrets at the north-eaſt and ſouth-eaſt corners, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by an open gallery which was ſupported by projecting cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: there is no portcullis. In the centre of the arched roof of the gateway is a ſquare aperture, calculated to annoy aſſailants who ſhould gain the outward gate. It commands a fine proſpect, overlooking the town of Morpeth, and the banks of Wanſbeck, where large tracts of woodlands are beautifully diſpoſed. Near this tower, towards the north-eaſt, and on the other ſide of the deep dell or valley, before deſcribed, is a round <hi>mound of earth,</hi> on a natural mount whoſe height is greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by art. It appears to have been raiſed rather by aſſailants than as an outwork or defence to the caſtle; for from thence, by engines, ſtones and miſſile weapons might be thrown into the interior parts of the fortreſs, to annoy the garriſon: and agreeable to the modes practiſed in early times, perhaps this was caſt up for an oppoſing fort and <hi>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiſin</hi> on ſome blockade. No record come to my knowledge proves who

was the firſt founder of this caſtle; early in the time of the Normans, the baronial ſeat of the Merleys was here, and probably they had a ſtronghold upon the very eminence where the preſent remains ſtand— the tower was the work of William Lord Greyſtock, who lived in the time of King Edward III. as appears by the eſcheats of that reign.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>the <hi>baronial inheritance</hi> of the family of <hi>Ogles,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Morpeth</hi> about four miles. This ride is extremely beautiful, lying within a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the river Wanſbeck, the banks of which to the ſouth are lofty, and cloathed with fine hanging woods, through which here and there you ſee a bold promontory or rocky precipice. All the environs of the river to Bothal are romantic and beautiful. The <hi>caſtle,</hi> though placed on a conſiderable eminence, yet ſtands in a very deep vale; hanging woods forming an amphitheatre at the diſtance of about half a mile. Its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remains chiefly conſiſt of the great gateway, flanked on the north ſide by two polygonal towers, 53 feet high; and on the ſouth-weſt angle by a ſquare turret, whoſe height meaſures 60 feet. From the towers of this gate the outward wall extends along the brink of the eminence, in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0085300202:313"/>
a circular form, encloſing the area and interior buildings of the caſtle. This encloſure contains about half an acre, in which are ſome ſcattered fragments of the inner buildings, now affording no degree of certainty what were their original form and uſe. To the north-weſt of the gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, was formerly another tower, pulled down within the memory of perſons living, which bore the denomination of Ogle's Tower. The ſcite of this caſtle to the ſouth is very lofty, on the brink of a rock, whoſe foot is waſhed by the river: the eaſt and weſt ſides of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence have been defended by a moat. Mr Groſe, to his ſecond plate of this caſtle, which chiefly repreſents the gateway tower, ſays, <q>the wood ſcene in the back ground ſlopes to the water's edge, here and there ſkirted by pictureſque rocks; and in many places the trees overhang the ſtream, which here runs briſkly, breaking againſt the huge ſtones plentifully ſcattered throughout its channel; at once cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating the eye, and by its gentle murmurs ſweetly ſoothing the ear. Indeed the banks of the Wanſbeck, between this place and Morpeth, afford a variety of ſylvan ſcenes, equal in beauty to any in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt deſcend to more minute deſcriptions of the gateway with its towers;<note n="*" place="bottom">This gate-way is of the ſame model as the gate of Alnwick caſtle, and by its architecture and ornaments appears to be nearly of the ſame date.</note> they bear a certain appearance of being the moſt modern parts of this caſtle; the architecture is excellent, and the edifice built of a durable ſtone, well dreſt, and in good preſervation: the aſcent from the town is eaſy and gradual. The outward gate was defended by a portcullis; in the arching of the roof of the gateway, are three ſquare apertures, from whence the garriſon could annoy the aſſailants, when they had gained the firſt gate; a door on each hand leads to the flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towers. On the right hand, is a paſſage and ſtaircaſe in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt tower; at the foot of the ſtairs is a door into the priſon, which is not ſo horrible an encloſure as moſt of thoſe ſeen in baronial caſtles: it is above ground, and cloſely arched, having narrow apertures, like loop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, to admit light and air from the gateway paſſage. Oppoſite to theſe ſtairs, on the other ſide of the gateway, is a large hall. Paſſing the winding ſtairs, we entered the ſtate-room, above the gateway: this apartment is lighted by four windows, none of them of any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſize; the principal one is to the north, in the centre: by means of the thickneſs of the wall, the receſs formed for the window is benched
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0085300202:314"/>
with ſtone at the ſides, with ſeats for ſix perſons at leaſt. From this window you view the town, the church, and a narrow vale, through which the river flows. On each ſide of this window, is a door leading to the chambers of the flanking towers. The fire-place, of a very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious range, is to the eaſt, on the left ſide of which is another window with a receſs, benched like that before deſcribed. A third window like the two former, is to the right of the door as you enter, looking into the area of the caſtle; a large window to the weſt commands the wider part of the vale, and the fine hanging woods by which it is is bounded. Three large ſtones cover the apertures in the floor, which open upon the paſſage of the gateway. The upper rooms being more ruinous, are not ſo eaſy to deſcribe, or their form capable of being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained. I walked theſe apartments with a veneration, proceeding from the tendereſt obligations; an alliance with a lineal deſcendant of thoſe illuſtrious families, who for ages poſſeſſed this inheritance.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In the front of the gateway, are ſeveral ſhields of arms arranged in the following order; which I apprehend, like thoſe at <hi>Alnwick,</hi> perfectly point out to us the time when this part of the caſtle was built. In the centre, in a large ſhield, are the arms of <hi>England and France</hi> quarterly. It is obſervable that England takes the firſt quarter, a thing I have never obſerved an inſtance of before. On the dexter ſide, a ſhield with the arms of <hi>England, three lions paſſant gardant;</hi> on the ſiniſter, a ſhield with the arms of the Grays, <hi>barry of ſix argent and azure, three torteauxes in chiefe.</hi> This denotes that the erection was made in the time of Edward IV. whoſe conſort was a Gray, mother of Thomas Gray, who in the 15th year of that reign was created Marquis of Dorſet. Beneath, in the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0085300202:315"/>
centre, the arms of Bertram, <hi>Or, an orl, azure.</hi> On the dexter and ſiniſter ſides of this, are three ſhields, which denote the alliances of the Bertram family.</p>
               <p>The firſt, on the dexter ſide, the arms of Percy</p>
               <p>The ſecond of Dacre</p>
               <p>The third of Veſey, Or, a croſs, ſable.</p>
               <p>The firſt, on the ſiniſter ſide, of Darcy</p>
               <p>The ſecond of Haſtings</p>
               <p>The third, two lions paſſant gardant in a treſſure; but to what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily this coat armour appertains, I cannot form any probable aſſertion.</p>
               <p>On the tower on the right hand of the gateway, are four ſhields, the chief of which is of the Ogles; but as they are greatly defaced by time, and on my view did not ſeem to have any material relation to the date or hiſtory of this erection, I paſſed them without particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but on conſidering the matter, I am induced to believe that John Ogle, the grandſon of the heireſs of Bertram, and who aſſumed the name of Bertram, erected this gateway. In the family of Ogles after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mentioned, he is particularly noticed.</p>
               <p>In the centre, on the battlement, is the figure of a man, in ſtone, in the attitude of ſounding a horn; on the right hand tower is another figure, holding a ball between his hands: theſe figures are greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the weather.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <q>This <hi>barony</hi> was held by Robert of the King in capite, by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of three Knights fees, as his anceſtors had formerly held it; the ſaid lands being <hi>de veteri feofmento,</hi> and paying yearly for the caſtle guard at <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tyne</hi> for <hi>cornage</hi> 5l. 15s. 4d.</q>

The town is ſmall, and chiefly inhabited by fiſhermen. There are ſeveral granaries for corn here. This whole coaſt is enlivened by trade, and opulence is diſpenſed on every ſide by the hand of induſtry. Human nature is capable of vaſt works; the capacity of man is infinite, the further it is exerted, the more is diſcovered for the advancement of its occupation.

No man is more valuable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, than he who applies his opulence in the improvements of agriculture: the produce of our lands is a ſtaple of which we cannot be robbed by foreign enemies; a treaſure which no change in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Europe can waſte; an inteſtine wealth, which will give power without the jeopardies attending common merchandize; the increaſe will ever find an efflux to ſtates which cannot ſupport their numbers by the produce of their own land, and will ever ſecure an influx of wealth. Our lands afford a perpetual ſupply of trade; the goods derived from manual occupations, are the objects of fluctuating taſte; and when Birmingham and Wolverhampton ſhall no longer bear the laborious anvil, our wool, our corn and cattle will remain a laſting ſource of wealth. Manual occupations are transferrable, and in future ages may and will be moved from their preſent ſeats, and take place in other kingdoms and diſtant quarters of the earth; but the produce of lands, as they are local, ſo are they univerſally neceſſary; thoſe of our climate in particular: others produce the luxuries we ſeek, but ours the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries every climate requires.

Moſt of the beſt rooms have marble chimney-pieces of admirable workmanſhip. All the offices in the baſe ſtory, which are very numerous, are arched with hewed ſtone, from whence you may go on the ſame level to the eaſt and weſt wings; in the former thereof are the noble ſtables, the chief of which is 62 feet long and 41 wide, and 24 feet 8 inches high, the roof being ſupported by three ſuperb arches 21 feet 4 inches high: the diviſions of all the ſtalls and the niches for the hay are of ſtone.

where divine ſervice is conſtantly performed: not far from thence there is an elegant <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> which has lately been built by Sir John and Lady Huſſey Delaval <hi>to the memory of their late ſon,</hi> who was the delight not only of his parents, but of all who knew him; his endowments were ſo pleaſing, and his manners ſo captivating, that the moſt able panegyriſt would want words to give an adequate idea of this <hi>moſt admirable young man.</hi> No expence has been ſpared in this pious edifice, which has been juſtly admired by every one who has ſeen it; the perron to the entrance being of the height of the zocle of the building, ſerves as a continual pedeſtal to it; the portico is of the doric order tetraſtite, the columns of which are each formed of one ſingle ſtone, weighing ſeveral tons, bearing a handſome pediment with a triangular tympanum: the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the whole is elegant and ſimple; a cupola covered with lead, riſing majeſtically in the centre, produces a very ſolemn appearance: the inſide is of the form of a chapel, having a nave in the middle, with an altar or communion table, above which a ſolemn dome is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſemicircular arches, opening to an aile on each ſide, in which are ſeveral arches and niches for the reception of tablets, inſcriptions, and monuments; underneath are catacombs ſtrongly arched, and of moſt durable workmanſhip: they are all founded, as is the whole of this ſtructure, upon a rock; and as all the ſtones of which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed are large, and ſet ſo cloſe together as not to admit of any wall falling, it is calculated to laſt as long as the work of man can do: it is encloſed by a ha-ha wall of 11 feet high and 5 feet thick, ſo wrought and put together as to have a rocky appearance, giving the idea of long duration; and by forming from its rudeneſs a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt to the building, which is all poliſhed as well as ſtone can be, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an admirable effect.</p>
               <p>A delightful ſhady walk, of a mile long, leads to Sir John's port of <hi>Hartley,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">In a periodical publication, printed for Snagg, in Fleet-ſtreet, I find the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: <q>
                        <hi>Cullicoats,</hi> a place otherwiſe of no great diſtinction, but worthy remembrance in this reſpect, that it is a very commodious little port, of artificial conſtruction, or as the common people ſtile it, an harbour made by hand. It is dry at low water and difficult at the entrance; but it ſerves for coals and ſalt belonging to the works of particular perſons, at whoſe expence it was conſtructed. <hi>Seaton Sluice</hi> was originally of the ſame kind. Sir Ralph Delaval was continually contriving new improvements, in the exerciſe of which he never heſitated at expence; and amongſt the reſt made this port, on his own plan, and entirely at his own charge, for the benefit of his tenants and himſelf immediately, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excluding others who choſe to uſe it. In the conſtruction of this ſmall harbour he found enough to exerciſe his ſkill and patience; the ſtone pier which covered it from the north eaſt wind, being carried away by the ſea more than once; and when he had overcome this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty by uſing timber as well as ſtone, he felt a new inconvenience by his port's filling up with mud and ſand, though a pretty ſharp rill ran through it, which had ſo hollowed the rock as to produce the very baſon which Sir Ralph would convert into a haven. In order to remove this miſchief, he placed a new ſtrong ſluice, with flood-gates upon his brook, and theſe being ſhut by the coming in of the Tyde, the back water collected itſelf into a body, and forcing a paſſage at the ebb, carried all before it; and twice in 24 hours ſcoured the bed of the haven clean. King Charles II. who had a great taſte for matters of this kind, made him collector and ſurveyor of his own port.</q>
                  </note> whence his coals, well known in London by that name, are
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0085300202:346"/>
ſhipped. There are alſo large ſalt works and copperas works, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very conſiderable glaſs works, which were built by Thomas Delaval, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and purchaſed of him by Sir John, who has cut through a ſolid and hard rock a new entrance into his harbour, which is 52 feet deep 30 feet broad, and 900 feet long: this great work he did at his own private expence, which no perſon has any ſhare or concern in but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: no ſhips come hither except for his coals, ſalt, glaſs, and copperas; the three laſt-mentioned works are carried on here for the ſake of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the ſmall coals of his colliery, which would without them be of no value. Before this new entrance was effected, the opportunity for exportation here was very confined, as the ſhips, for want of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient depth of water in the old entrance, were obliged to be loaded with keels, whereas they can now ſail out with their full loadings. Theſe works produce to the public <hi>a revenue of above</hi> 20,000<hi>l. a year,</hi> and afford Sir John the means of conſtantly ſupporting ſeveral hundred people who live upon his eſtate in honeſt induſtry, in which he and Lady Huſſey Delaval take great delight.</p>
               <p>Sir John has alſo made a little harbour of refuge in <hi>St. Mary's Iſland,</hi> for the ſafety of the Fiſhermen upon this coaſt, by which many have been ſaved who could not poſſibly, in certain winds, have reached any other harbour.</p>

The work was begun in the year 1761, and compleated in two or three years. The front is to the ſouth, the centre of which is formed by a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hexagonal projection, and its terminations are ſquare turrets; from whence, on each hand, a regular wing is advanced. On the weſt ſide of the area in front, is an old ſquare tower of ſingular form, it being compoſed of two turrets, one ariſing above another; the upper one being ſo much leſs than that which ſupports it, as to afford a ſpacious battlement. The area is encloſed by a wall embrazured and garniſhed with turrets, the entrance to which is by a ſpacious gateway: the wall is defended by corner towers.</p>
               <p>This caſtle is ſeated on the eaſt banks of the river Till: It appears by Madox's Exch. p. 647, that <hi>Sir William Heron</hi> built it in the 12th year of the reign of King Henry III. A. D. 1227, the eſtate having come to his family by an intermarriage with the heireſs of <hi>Ford,</hi> who derived her deſcent from <hi>Odonel de Ford,</hi> as is mentioned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding page 19, and who was ſeized thereof in the time of King Henry I.</p>
               <p>The caſtle commands a fine proſpect up the valley as far as Wooler bounded by lofty eminences, which riſing ſwiftly, are broken in the moſt agreeable and romantic manner. To the weſtward, at about the diſtance of a mile and a half, you view <hi>Flodden Hill,</hi> marked to the eye by a riſing plantation of firs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Made by Sir John Huſſey Delaval.</note> which crowns the eminence, and gives a beautiful object upon the landſkip. In great floods the Till over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows ſeveral hundreds of acres of flat ground; the extenſive ſheet of water makes a grand appearance from the caſtle: when it ſubſides, the plain is left covered with a moſt fertilizing mud, by which the ſoil is greatly enriched.</p>
               <p>From the happy taſte her Ladyſhip poſſeſſes for a rural life, Sir John has advanced the more rapidly in thoſe works of improvement which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0085300202:348"/>
mark the adjacent country. The fair example becomes illuſtrious, by the contraſt which is ſeen in the lives of perſons of equal rank and opulence. The works which are ſpread around <hi>Ford</hi> and <hi>Seaton Delaval,</hi> whilſt they diſpenſe felicity to innumerable laborious families, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute greatly to the general opulence of the ſtate. No panegyric can pay due praiſe to thoſe who thus employ their abundant wealth: the effect is not contracted within the circle of Sir John's poſſeſſions, the example influences as it carries with it conviction, and many are thereby induced to cultivate and improve the adjacent eſtates, recovering from a prepoſſeſſion of ages of ignorance, that the nature of the ſoil and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate would fruſtrate their attempts. A vaſt tract of land, on which you look from <hi>Ford,</hi> was within 20 years laſt paſt, one continued ſheep-walk; now interſected and encloſed with excellent quick-wood fences; the eminences adorned with fine plantations; the large and open farms which heretofore gave the country the aſpect of poverty and deſolation, are now ſubdivided, and let out into ſmaller allotments from 60l. to 200l. a year each, by which the country has become well peopled, and the lands, which for paſturage did not yield above one ſhilling per acre, now let for twenty-five ſhillings. The vice of enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farms, deſtroying villages, and thereby depopulating a country, was advanced to ſuch enormity in the reigns of King Henry VII. and King Henry VIII. that it called for a parliamentary inquiry and reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No language can more ſtrongly expreſs the error, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of the ſtatute of the 25th of King Henry VIII. cha. 14. <q>For as much as divers and ſundry perſons of the King's ſubjects of this realm, to whom God of his goodneſs hath diſpoſed great plenty and abundance of moveable ſubſtance, now of late within few years have daily ſtudied, practiſed, and invented ways and means how they might accumulate and gather together into few hands as well great multitude of farms as great plenty of cattle, and in eſpecial ſheep, putting ſuch lands as they can get to paſture, and not to tillage, whereby they have not only pulled down churches and towns, and enhanced the old rates of the rents of the poſſeſſions of this realm, or elſe brought it to ſuch exceſſive fines, that no poor man is able to meddle with it, but alſo have raiſed and enhanced the prices of corn, cattle, wool, pigs, geeſe, hens, chickens, eggs, and ſuch other, almoſt double above the prices which have been accuſtomed; by reaſon whereof a marvelous multitude and number of the people of this realm be not able to provide meat, drink, and cloaths neceſſary for themſelves, their wives and children; but be ſo diſcouraged with

miſery and poverty, that they fall daily to theft, robbery, and other inconveniences, or pitifully die for hunger and cold. And as it is thought by the King's moſt humble and loving ſubjects, that one of the greateſt occaſions that moveth and provoketh thoſe greedy and covetous people, ſo to accumulate and keep in their hands ſuch great portions and parts of the grounds and lands of this realm from the occupying of the poor huſbandmen, and ſo to uſe it in paſture and not in tillage, is only the great profit that cometh of ſheep, which now be come to a few perſons hands of this realm, in reſpect of the whole number of the King's ſubjects, that ſome have 24,000, ſome 20,000, ſome 10,000, ſome 6000, ſome 5000, and ſome more and ſome leſs; by the which a good ſheep for victual, that was accuſtomed to be ſold for 2s. 4d. or 3s. at the moſt, now ſold for 6s. or 5s. or 4s. at the leaſt; and a ſtone of clothing wool, that in ſome ſhires of this realm was accuſtomed to be ſold for 18d. or 20d. now ſold for 4s. or 3s. 4d. at the leaſt; and in ſome counties where it hath been ſold for 2s. 4d. or 2s. 8d. or 3s. at the moſt, is now ſold for 5s. or 4s. 8d. at the leaſt, and ſo are raiſed in every part of this realm: Which things, thus uſed, be principally to the high diſpleaſure of Almighty God, to the decay of the hoſpitality of this realm, to the diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the King's people, and to the let of the cloth-making, whereby many poor people have been accuſtomed to be ſet on work; and in concluſion, if remedy be not found, it may turn to the utter deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſolation of this realm, which God defend.</q>—By this law, which is ſtill ſubſiſting, no farmer, under a penalty to be levied by Juſtices of the Peace, ſhould hold more than <hi>two farms,</hi> and they to be in one pariſh, where he ſhould reſide; and no farmer to have above 2000 ſheep.</p>
               <p>Not only the pleaſure her Ladyſhip takes in promoting Sir John's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the improvements of the adjacent lands, ſhe alſo, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was a chief cauſe of the <hi>Iron Manufactory</hi> carried on near <hi>Ford,</hi> being brought to its preſent ſignificance. About a mile down the river, a <hi>Plating-Forge</hi> was erected in 1769, where a large quantity of ſhovels, ſpades, and other plate-iron works are made, as well for home con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as for exportation at the ports of Berwick, Newcaſtle, &amp;c. The ſcheme, when carried to its intended extent, will be of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to this part of the country. The ſituation of the <hi>Forge</hi> is ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, and the whole ſcene pictureſque. The water to ſupply the wheels is collected by a dam, and forms a fine canal, from whence it
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0085300202:351"/>
breaks over the wear in a beautiful caſcade; and being intercepted in its lower courſe by rocks and hillocks, divides itſelf into ſeveral ſtreams. The buildings for the forge, as you look up the river, lay to the left; on the oppoſite ſide is a water-corn-mill: the vale ſeen above the canal conſiſts of cultivated and encloſed grounds, which are highly contraſted by the lofty eminences which bound the proſpect, finely broken and irregular, through which the light ſtreams, and gives a ſingular beauty to the offſcape: theſe at the extreme point of view are overlooked by Cheviot, awfully ſupreme and majeſtic, on whoſe brow heavy vapours are generally ſeen ſuſpended.</p>

The beſt account which has yet been given of it, is by Mr Groſe, which I ſhall take the liberty to tranſcribe.

                  <q>A gentleman in the neighbourhood remembers it ſtanding, though in a tottering condition, and much out of the perpendicular: he thinks it was then near ten feet high: it has lately been thrown down and broken; two pieces of it are now remaining, one of which, meaſuring three feet and a half, has been ſet up, the other, of about three feet, is the part repreſented (in Mr Groſe's plate) lying on the ground; on the pedeſtal is the inſcription, <hi>O horror, to kill a man for a pigges head:</hi> the characters ſeem more modern than the obeliſk. This monument is of a whin ſtone; its plan, what is called an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſquare: it is injured by time, and beſides which, the country people have punched it ſo full of round holes, and otherwiſe ſo defaced it, as not only to render its ornaments unintelligible, but alſo to make it doubtful, whether all its ſides, or only the two broadeſt were ornamented.</q> The following traditionary ſtory, relative to this monument, is alſo given by Mr Groſe. <q>A Monk of this monaſtery, ſtrolling abroad, came to the houſe of Mr Delaval, an anceſtor of the ancient family of that name, who was then abſent on an hunting party, but was expected back to dinner: among the many diſhes preparing in the kitchen, was a pig ordered purpoſely for Mr Delaval's own eating: this alone ſuiting the liquoriſh palate of the Monk, and though admoniſhed and informed for whom it was intended, he cut off the head, reckoned by epicures the moſt delicious part of the animal, and putting it into a bag, made the beſt of his way towards the monaſtery. Delaval, at his return, being informed of the tranſaction, which he looked upon as a perſonal inſult, and

being young and fiery, remounted his horſe, and ſet out in ſearch of the offender; when overtaking him, about a mile eaſt of Preſton, he ſo belaboured him with his ſtaff, called a hunting gad, that he was hardly able to crawl to his cell. The Monk dying within a year and a day, although as the ſtory goes the beating was not the cauſe of his death, his brethren made it a handle to charge Delaval with his murther; who before he could get abſolved, was obliged to make over to the monaſtery, as an expiation of this deed, the manor of Elſig, in the neighbourhood of Newcaſtle, with ſeveral other valuable eſtates; and by way of <hi>amende honourable,</hi> to ſet up an obeliſk, on the ſpot where he properly corrected the Monk. Elſig was afterwards made the ſummer retreat of the Priors of Tynmouth.</q> 
                  <q>This ſtory, like many others of the like kind, is very defective in ſeveral parts; no date is affixed, and the above-mentioned monument is ſhewn in ſupport of it; it ſeems difficult to account for this Monk being ſo far from his monaſtery, eſpecially alone, which was ſtrictly prohibited by their rules: and this not being of the Mendicant order, he could not be going on the queſt. The only method of reconciling it, is to ſuppoſe that this perſonage was a lay-brother, and ſervant to the houſe. It however ſhews how dangerous it was to injure the meaneſt retainer to a religious houſe: a peril very ludicriouſly, though juſtly expreſſed in the following old Engliſh adage, which I have ſomewhere met with: "<hi>If perchaunce one offende a Freeres Dogge, ſtreight clameth the whole brotherhood, an hereſy! an hereſy!"</hi>

               <p>lies to the eaſt end of the town, on a peninſula formed of ſtupendous rocks, on the north ſide of the mouth of the river Tyne, againſt which heavy ſeas break with great vehemence and tumult. The approach to the priory in its preſent ſtate is from the weſt, by a gateway tower of a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0085300202:356"/>
ſquare form, having a circular exploratory turret on each corner: from this gateway, on each hand, a ſtrong double wall has extended to the rocks on the ſea ſhore, which from their great height have been eſteemed in former times inacceſſible. The gate with its walls was fortified by a deep outward ditch, over which there was a drawbridge, defended by moles on each ſide. The tower comprehends an outward and interior gateway, the outward gateway having two gates at the diſtance of about ſix feet from each other, the inner of which is defended by a portcullis and an open gallery: the interior gateway is in like manner ſtrengthened by a double gate. The ſpace between the gateways, being a ſquare of about ſix paces, is open above, to allow thoſe on the top of the tower and battlements to annoy aſſailants who had gained the firſt gate. By dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accounts it appears, that there was a place of conſiderable ſtrength here in very remote antiquity: Camden ſays, <q>there are ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the rampier, not the (Roman) wall, went as far as to the very mouth of Tyne, and affirm it was called <hi>Pen-bal-crag,</hi> that is, <hi>the head of the rampier on the rock.</hi> I dare avouch, this was in the time of the Romans <hi>Tunnocellum,</hi> expreſſing <hi>the promontory of Tunn or Tyne,</hi> where lay the firſt cohort <hi>Aela Claſſica,</hi> enrolled (probably from the name) by <hi>Aelius Hadrianus,</hi> the Emperor, and in pay for ſea ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: for the Romans had certain light pinnaces, termed <hi>Luforiae,</hi> upon the rivers.</q>—What it was in the time of the Saxons, as a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we have little or no evidence to be depended upon. The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation on the <hi>oſtium</hi> of ſo important a river, and ſo well calculated for the command of this ſhore, induced <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> to order it ſhould be converted into a fortreſs: the religious inhabitants were ill ſuited to this plan, and the firſt degradation of this monaſtery was by WALTHEOF Earl and Governor of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> at the command of his Sovereign, who it is known had very little veneration for religious inſtitutions. At this period it was fortified with the wall and tower before deſcribed. <hi>Robert Mowbray,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> made choice of it for his ſtronghold, when he rebelled againſt King William Rufus. But as it uſually happens with rebels, he had ill ſucceſs: being cloſely beſieged, he withdrew himſelf into the monaſtery, and claimed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſanctuary, a protection preſumed to be inviolable in thoſe days. Notwithſtanding which, he was dragged forth by the conquerors, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Windſor, and held in cloſe durance there for a long time before he was put to death.<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden.</note> On its being converted into a fortreſs, it took

the name of Tynemouth Caſtle; it belonged to the Earls of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland from the time of <hi>Waltheof</hi> for ſeveral generations. In Peck's <hi>Deſiderata Curioſa,</hi> Tynemouth Caſtle is mentioned in the liſt of caſtles, bulwarks, and fortreſſes garriſoned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, whereby it appears here was a maſter gunner and ſix inferior gunners. In Camden's time it was in good repair: he ſays, <q>it is now called Tynemouth Caſtle, and glories in a ſtately and ſtrong caſtle.</q> It was beſieged by the Scots in 1644, when the garriſon were obliged to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to the arms of the Parliament, and ſubmit to their inſtructions. On this occaſion there was delivered up 38 pieces of cannon, a great ſtand of arms, with ſtores of ammunition and proviſion of very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable amount. Several of the garriſon, (it is ſaid during a violent ſtorm) eſcaped by the privies. A large ſum was appropriated by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to reſtore the injury this fortreſs ſuſtained in the ſiege, and <hi>Colonel Henry Lilburn</hi> was made Governor: but he deſerting his party, the garriſon ſoon after revolted. <hi>Sir Arthur Hezelrig,</hi> who lay at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, marched immediately to reduce them, and took the place by ſtorm: the men ſcaling the walls in the moſt intrepid manner, at the mouths of the cannon, entered by the embrazures and port-holes; and after a ſhort engagement with the garriſon within the fortifications, ſoon became maſters of it. In the conflict <hi>Lilburn</hi> was ſlain.</p>
               <p>On paſſing the gateway, the ſcene is ſtrikingly noble and venerable; the whole encloſed area may contain about ſix acres; the walls ſeem as well calculated for defence as the gateway tower; the view is crowded with auguſt ruins; many fine arches of the priory are ſtanding; the moſt beautiful part of theſe remains is the eaſtern limb of the church, of elegant workmanſhip. The ruins are ſo diſunited, that it would be very difficult to determine to what particular offices each belonged. On the ſouth ſide, adjoining the wall which ſtands on the brink of the cliff, are ſeveral ſpacious vaulted chambers, one of which I conceived was the kitchen, from the large extended fire-place; another the priſon, with an aperture in the top of the vault, by which the miſerable cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deſcended to his horrid dungeon. On the north and eaſt ſides, the cliffs appear to be about 10 perpendicular fathoms in height, at the feet of which, on a broken rocky ſhore, the ſea beats impetuouſly. From the walls on the ſouth ſide, you have a view of the batteries which command the mouth of Tyne, with the barracks for the garriſon. On the north ſide, is a houſe built by <hi>Colonel Henry Villiers,</hi> once Governor of this fortreſs, together with a light-houſe, for the benefit of ſhipping

               <p>The ruins which preſent themſelves in front, on entering the gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, appear to be the remains of the cloiſter, to which you have acceſs by a gateway of circular arches, comprehending ſeveral members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining inwards, and ariſing from pilaſters. After paſſing this gate, in the area many modern tombs appear, the ground being ſtill uſed for ſepulture. The weſt gate entering into the abbey is ſtill entire, of the ſame architecture as that leading to the cloiſter. The ground from the cloiſter to the ſouth wall is almoſt covered with foundations of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which I preſume are the remains of the priory. Two walls of the eaſt end of the church are ſtanding; the end wall to the eaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains three long windows; the centre window, the loftieſt, is near 20 feet high, richly ornamented with mouldings; ſome of roſe-work, and others of the dancette, as the figure is termed in heraldry, or zig-zag, a decoration common to old Saxon architecture. The diviſions or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars between the windows are enriched with pilaſters of five members, with highly finiſhed foliated capitals and cornices. Above the centre win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, is an oval one with like mouldings, and the openings of a gallery on each ſide. Part of the ſouth ſide wall of the choir is alſo ſtanding, illuminated with four windows of like form as thoſe to the eaſt, and equally ornamented, though not of the ſame height; for above them are an equal number of ſmall windows: the diviſions or pillars between the larger windows are decorated with pilaſters, of the ſame kind as
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0085300202:360"/>
thoſe at the eaſt end; in the diviſions or pillars between the ſmaller windows, ſpring the groins of the arches which formed the roof, by their remains ſhewing they were ornamented with rich mouldings. The arches of the windows in this part are circular; the blank arches which are thrown upon the wall beneath the windows are pointed. The architecture through the whole of this part of the building is ſingularly light and beautiful; the erection conſiſts of a red freeſtone, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures the weather well, in this ſtormy ſituation.</p>
               <p>Beneath the centre window at the eaſt end, is a doorway, of like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent workmanſhip, conducting to a ſmall but elegant apartment, which I conceive has contained the ſhrine and tomb of St. Oſwine. On each ſide of the door, is a human head, cut in a ſtile much ſuperior to that of the general taſte of the age in which they are ſuppoſed to have been executed. The apartment within is 18 feet in length, and nine feet in breadth and height. On the ſouth ſide is an entrance from the open yard with two windows, on the north ſide three windows, and a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular window to the eaſt, ſo elevated as to give place for an altar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath: there are two niches for ſtatues at the eaſt end, a cloſet for the veſſels for ſacred offices, and a baſon for holy water: on each ſide of the window is the figure of a Monk kneeling, and two of the emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical animals commonly depicted with the Evangeliſts: the ſide walls are ornamented with pilaſters, from whence ſpring the groins and arches of ſtone, which in various interſections form the roof; the joinings of which are enriched with circles of carved work, and the interſtices of the roof are arched and conſtructed with thin bricks. The circles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſculptures of the divine Perſonages with the Apoſtles, of workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip far from being deſpicable, and all the figures are in good preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Round each ſculpture is a circular belt with a ſentence in the old Engliſh character, well raiſed, viz. <hi>Sanct. Petrus ora P. nobis,</hi> &amp;c. each varied by the name of the perſonage to whom it is inſcribed. The centre row conſiſts of four circles; in one is the effigies of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> with the like ſentence; in a ſecond, towards the weſt, the effigies of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> with a Monk kneeling; in a third, to the eaſt, the effigies of the <hi>Supreme,</hi> with the Lamb bearing an enſign; and in the fourth, a repreſentation of the laſt judgment, with this ſentence: <hi>In die judicii liberare nos.</hi> Above the door is the effigies of our Saviour with a globe in his hand, with <hi>morit P. nobis,</hi> ſubſcribed; on each ſide of the door, an emblematical figure, as to the eaſt.

Eraſmus, in his piece intitled the Shipwreck, has very humourouſly deſcribed and ridiculed this cuſtom of bribing heaven in caſe of ſudden emergency. In Germany, below almoſt every dangerous fall or paſſage of the Rhine, there is a hermitage, whoſe Hermit, or his Agent, waits on the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger in the boat, as ſoon as it has paſſed over, requeſting alms as a reward for his prayers, to the efficacy of which it is intimated he owes his ſafety.

               <p>The firſt day of our abode here was employed in drawing views of the auguſt remains. The next morning being remarkably ſerene, awaked me early to reviſit the ſame ſcene, and enjoy the ſea breeze. I walked towards the cliffs—the ſun caſt a ruddy gleam over a calm ocean —the breeze ſcarce ruffled the leaping ſurge—the horizon glowed with clouds tinged with gold and crimſon; above which the feint blue of the verge gradually deepened into azure, as the eye advanced towards the zenith—the ſea appeared of a pale green, ſtrip'd with ſilver, as the rays of light fell upon the tracks which were becalmed—the ſcene was enlivened by a fleet of veſſels, 44 in number, of various degrees of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which then paſſed in view—over the foreground of this proſpect, the ſolemn ruins were diſpoſed in melancholy arrangement, wearing a countenance more awful and majeſtic, from the ſhadows which the eaſtern ſun occaſioned to be caſt on them—on the right hand and left, the landſkip preſented itſelf full of life and buſineſs; and to add to the effects this view had on the mind, the morning drum was heard from the garriſon, the hum of the diſtant voices of buſy men, and the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the hollow ſhore, beat by an advancing tide.</p>
               <p>Leaving Tynemouth, we paſſed within ſight of the barracks and batteries to</p>

               <p>which is not improperly compared to Wapping: the ſtreets, lanes, and alleys are narrow, dirty, populace, and noiſy. It is aſtoniſhing what buſineſs is inceſſantly going on here: we were told there lay in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, even at that ſeaſon of the year, above 400 ſail of ſhips of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable burthen. The crews of ſuch a number of veſſels, the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, ropers, victuallers, and men concerned in the merchandizing of ſuch a fleet, muſt neceſſarily occaſion a mighty concourſe and buſtle: to which being added the family of ſailors reſiding here, makes the place reſemble a hive of bees.</p>
               <p>Shields has advanced to its preſent ſtate of populouſneſs, trade, and riches, from a very low eſtate, within the ſpace of two centuries: the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0085300202:372"/>
church was begun to be built in the year 1659: in the beginning of the reign of King Edward I. it conſiſted only of ſix fiſhermen's hovels. By the arguments in a cauſe depending between the King and his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of Newcaſtle and the Prior of Tynemouth, in the 20th year of that reign, it appears, that the Prior had built a town upon the bank of the water of Tyne on one ſide, and the Prior of Durham another on the other ſide, where no towns ought to be, only lodges for fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and that the fiſhermen had there ſold their fiſhes, which ought to have been ſold at Newcaſtle: and that both the ſaid Priors had cauſed to be made breweries and fiſheries, having great ſhips, whereas they ought to have had but boats; and had cauſed bread to be baked there, which ought to have been baked at Newcaſtle. It was decreed, that neither at Tynemouth or Shields there be any ſale of things ſaleable, as in meats, drinks, &amp;c. and that ſhips ſhould not be laden or unladen there. This will ſerve to ſhew what was the ſtate of this place in the 13th century.</p>
               <p>We took a boat to examine this buſy ſcene upon the water: the ſight of ſo many veſſels, and ſuch a concourſe of people, is very pleaſing: it conſequently brings to one's mind, reflections on the powers of human faculties. The genius of man is infinite; if we could be taught for 1000 years, we ſhould diſcover at that period, from the learning we had acquired, that we had an infinity of ſubjects yet to learn: for the more knowledge man attains, the wider circle of objects unattained opens upon him. As the ſcale of numerical calculation is without end; as the variations of muſical tones are infinite; ſo is man's genius. By the uſe of letters we have accumulated the learning of ages; yet after the concluſion of a few centuries, all our acquiſitions will perhaps appear to poſterity, as but minute members of the ſcience of mankind. Before the uſe of letters, with the fall of empires, the accumulated knowledge of ages expired with them; but henceforth it will not be ſo.</p>
               <p>How wonderfully perfect is all maritime ſcience now, to what it was in the moſt flouriſhing period of the Egyptian and Phoenician ſtates! We are told the timber for building the temple at Jeruſalem was floated in rafts: This ſhews the force of the ſhipping then employed. The mariners of antiquity ſeldom truſted themſelves from the ſight of the coaſt. The Grecian and Roman fleets were compoſed of inſignificant veſſels, compared with a Britiſh navy. The diſcovery of the magnet has given infinite powers to the Mariner; our geometrical principles
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0085300202:373"/>
have fitted our veſſels for ſwift ſailing and the carriage of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. The ark of Noah was little better than a huge caſk rolling on the face of the deep; whoſe preſervation was miraculous, and not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical, amidſt the perils of an univerſal ocean. The veſſels of the Phoenicians were little ſuperior to our lime-boats; their rigging and devices for ſailing greatly inferior: and the moſt excellent of the Roman gallies comparable only to the gilded barges of a Lord Mayor's ſhew. The moſt ſuperb veſſel we read of in antiquity was conſtructed by Archimedes: <q>it was a whole year in building—had twenty benches of oars; the enormous pile was faſtened together on all ſides with huge nails of copper, that weighed each ten pounds and upwards: the inſide had in it three galleries or corridors; the loweſt of which led to the hold by a deſcent of ſtairs; the ſecond to apartments, and the firſt to ſoldiers lodgings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>On the right and left ſide of the middle gallery, there were to the number of thirty apartments; in each of which were four beds for men. The apartment for the officers and ſeamen had 15 beds, and three great rooms for eating; the laſt of which that was at the poop ſerved for a kitchen. All the floors of theſe apartments were laid with ſmall ſtories in different colours, taken from the Iliad of Homer. The ceilings, windows, and all the other parts were finiſhed with wonderful art, and embelliſhed with all kinds of ornaments.</q>

In them were gardens and plants of all kinds, diſpoſed in wonderful order. Pipes, ſome of hardened clay and others of lead, conveyed water all round to refreſh them. There was alſo arbours of ivy and vines, that had their roots in great veſſels filled with earth. Theſe veſſels were watered in the ſame manner with the gardens.

In another apartment there was a library, at the top of which, on the outſide, was fixed a ſun-dial.</q>

                  <q>There was alſo an apartment with three beds for a bath, in which were three great coppers, and a bathing veſſel made of a ſingle ſtone of various colours. This veſſel contained 250 quarts. At the ſhip's head was a great reſervoir of water, which held an hundred thouſand quarts. All round the ſhip, on the outſide, were atlaſſes of ſix cubits or nine feet in height, which ſupported the ſides of the ſhip: theſe atlaſſes were at equal diſtance from each other. The ſhip was adorned on all ſides with paintings, and had eight towers, proportioned to its bigneſs; two at the head, two at the ſtern, and four in the middle, of equal dimenſions. Upon theſe towers were parapets, from which ſtones might be diſcharged upon the ſhips of an enemy that ſhould approach too near. Each tower was guarded by four young men compleatly armed and two archers; the inſide of them was filled with ſtones and arrows.</q>

                  <q>Upon the ſide of the veſſel, well ſtrengthened with planks, was a a kind of rampart, on which was an engine to diſcharge ſtones, made by Archimedes: it threw a ſtone of 300 weight and an arrow of 12 cubits the diſtance of a ſtadium or 125 paces. The ſhip had three maſts, at each of which were two machines to diſcharge ſtones. There alſo were the hooks and great lumps of lead to throw upon ſuch as approached. The whole ſhip was ſurrounded with a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of iron to keep off thoſe who ſhould attempt to board it. All round were iron graplings diſpoſed, which being thrown by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, might catch hold on the enemy's veſſel, and draw them cloſe to the ſhip, from whence it was eaſy to deſtroy them. On each of the ſides were 60 young men compleatly armed: there were as many about the maſts and at the engines for throwing ſtones.</q>

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0085300202:377"/>
Severus's wall has very manifeſtly terminated in a ſquare fort or ſtation, above a furlong to the eaſt of the manſion called Couſins's Houſe. The ruins of a Roman ſtation and town at this place are very diſcernible, though it has all been ploughed, and is now a very rich meadow. The ſtones and rubbiſh of the buildings are levelled, and covered with earth and graſs, but yet the ramparts of the fort may be diſtinctly traced out, both they and the ditch being viſible, almoſt quite round.</p>
               <p>In Mr Warburton's Vallum Romanum, and Mr Horſley's Brit. Rom. are the following particulars, which I will tranſcribe, as at the time I viſited this ſtation I could not traverſe the ground without injuring the crops growing. <q>There are very evident remains of two turrets at the weſtern and eaſtern entries to the ſtation, and of another at the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt corner. The weſt entry has been cloſe to the wall, and the eaſtern one directly oppoſite to it. The fort has been about 140 yards, or perhaps ſix chains ſquare, and ſo the contents of it above three acres and an half. About 60 yards of the weſtern and eaſtern ſides lie without, or to the north of the line of the wall, and eighty within it; ſo that the wall falls upon the ſides of the ſtation, not far from the middle of them. The ſouth rampart of this fort is about three quarters of a furlong from the river ſide, and runs along the brow of the hill, or at the head of a conſiderable deſcent from thence to the river. There have been ruins of buildings on this part and to the ſouth-weſt of the fort; but they are now ſo levelled and covered, that little evidence appears above ground; yet the ſtones and remains of rubbiſh are eaſily diſcovered, when the ſurface is any where removed: and ſome of theſe inequalities in the ſurface, which uſually ariſe from ruins, yet remain, and may eaſily be perceived to be hillocks of ſtones or rubbiſh.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr Horſley gives the following inſcriptions as belonging to this place:</p>
                     <p>I. Cohortis primae centuria Fiari poſuit.</p>
                     <p>This ſtone with the five next (as alſo a piece of an altar and part of a pedeſtal) are all placed in niches in the outſide of the wall belonging to Couſins Houſe, where they have ſtood unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and neglected for many years, and being expoſed to the winds and weather, have ſuffered very much by that means. I cannot find that the leaſt notice has been taken of them before; the four firſt are plainly centurial, ſuch as were generally placed in the face of the wall, and are rarely found in any other ſtation. Hence we have one argument, that this ſtation was built at the ſame time with the wall, in the reign of Severus. The cohorts mentioned in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions were certainly legionary. The mark for the century is very clear and diſtinct in all of them, and the names of the centurions, as in moſt others of the ſame kind, are in the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. For which reaſon, I think, that the mark is not to be read centurio, but centuria, (as it is frequently read in Gruter) and that <hi>poſuit</hi> is to be ſupplied or underſtood at the end; ſo that <hi>cohortis primae centuria fiari,</hi> is much the ſame as to ſay, ſuch a Captain's company of ſuch a regiment. Indeed <hi>centurio cohortis,</hi> or the centurion of a cohort, does often occur in inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but does not neceſſarily imply, that the whole command of the cohort was in a ſingle centurion; for we have alſo <hi>centurio legionis</hi> and <hi>miles legionis,</hi> which can ſignify no more than ſuch a perſon was a centurion or a ſoldier in ſuch a legion.</p>

                     <p>This has ſuſtained more damage than the former, by being expoſed to the weather; for the number of the cohort is effaced. The mark for the century is alſo faint, and one of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion's names very obſcure, but the other name Priſcus is plain and clear, the letters being groſs, tho' ſhort, and cut very deep in the ſtone.

                  </note> Mr Gordon ſuppoſes, that the wall itſelf forms almoſt
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0085300202:378"/>
a right angle, and then is continued down to the ſide of the river: but it is the weſtern rampart of the ſtation which makes that angle with the wall: nor does this rampart reach the river, though it is likely the town or buildings without the fort may have extended ſo far. On the north ſide of the ſtation there are ſome crooked riſings and ſetlings of the ground, which at firſt view appeared to me not unlike a round fort or tower, projecting from the ſtation with a triple rampart and ditch. The two cloſes in which the Roman town and ſtation have ſtood, are called Wall Lawes. If the name Lawes be owing to the riſing ground only, the termination Lawes or Lowes, which ſignifies hills, ſo far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds to the Roman name Segedunum. But as there were two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Tumuli obſerved by Mr Warburton remaining near a place he calls the Beehouſes, and not far from theſe cloſes, he apprehends that from them they have borrowed this name; a Lawe or Lowe being one of thoſe names by which Tumuli are frequently expreſſed. There was an altar and ſome centurial inſcriptions at Couſins's Houſe, in Mr Horſleys time.</p>
               <p>The wall having left this ſtation, paſſes on weſtward, and at a little diſtance the remains of a caſtellum are viſible. It is 60 feet ſquare, like thoſe mentioned in the moſt weſtern parts of this county, it is built cloſe to the wall, and wholly within it, on the ſouth ſide. From hence the wall paſſes by Walker or Wallkier or Byker Hill, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to Eweſburn, where are ſome ruinous heaps, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have been the remains of ſome of the ſmaller exploratory turrets that have been placed all the way upon the wall. Hence the wall ſeems
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0085300202:379"/>
to have paſſed through the houſe at Red Barns, and enters Newcaſtle at Pandon Gate.</p>
               <p>Mr Horſley and other authors ſeem very doubtful of the veſtiges of the military way, from the wall's end to Newcaſtle. Near the Red Barns, and upon the deſcent from Byker Hill to Eweſburn, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the track where it had gone might in ſome places be traced, but the appearance was ſo very faint and obſcure, they would not inſiſt upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As for Hadrian's vallum, Mr Warburton ſays he could no where in all this ſpace diſcern the leaſt track of it; nor did he ever hear of any traditionary account of its having been there.</q>—Mr Pennant<note n="*" place="bottom">Tour in Scotland, vol. II. p. 289.</note> ſays, <q>it was ſuppoſed to have reached no further than Pons Aelii, or Newcaſtle, on the eaſt. But by an account he had recently received from Mr Robert Harriſon of that town, he found it extended on this ſide as far as the wall of Severus. A broken ſtone has lately been diſcovered at Wall's End with this inſcription:</q>

               <p>The diſtance from the ſtation at the end of the wall to St. Nicholas's church in Newcaſtle, is exactly three meaſured miles and five furlongs, and in this ſpace there are three caſtella all viſible: that which ſhould have been next in courſe, is loſt in the ſtation at Newcaſtle.</p>

On the north ſide of this old building are the remains of a fortification, which 'tis natural to conjecture was built for the ſafety and ſecurity of this houſe, and conſequently this houſe muſt have been of ſome great diſtinction. Robert de Gaugy was a great man in the reign of King John, and had ſpecial truſt repoſed in him by his Sovereign, and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable when the King came to theſe parts he lodged at this houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The preſent houſe was built in the year 1713, and is ſo ſituated, that on the weſt it overlooks the Town Moor, Fenham, and part of the lands of the Prior of Tinmouth; on the eaſt it faces the Shields road; on the north it has a moſt agreeable proſpect to the windings of the Ouſe burn, of its woods and banks, and of the villages ſituated on it; on the ſouth it faces the river Tyne.</q>

                           <p>The firſt of them is very curious, as it gives us the name of a <hi>Legatus Auguſtalis &amp; Propraetor,</hi> hitherto unknown in Britain, and which ought, as I think, to be read as follows.</p>

                           <p>To read G R in the 4th line <hi>Gregulium</hi> is not a little doubtful; it cannot well be ſuppoſed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an alter to the deity of the Emperor, and at the ſame time to the genius of the common ſoldiers, excluſive of the genius of the officers, of which he himſelf was one; and how to read it otherwiſe is as uncertain, if the letters are G R as in your copy: but if they are C R, as on the altar given us by <hi>Mr Horſley,</hi> Durham, No. 26, in his Brit. Rom. and which you ſay has C very apparent inſtead of G, they may denote <hi>Civium Romanorum,</hi> and theſe <hi>Varduli</hi> a people of Spain, admitted to the freedom of the city of Rome for ſome extraordinary merit, or by ſome Emperor's favour, perhaps their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Trajans: this was a privilege frequently conferred on foreigners, even whole towns and nations, and at laſt communicated by Antoninus Pius <hi>omnibus</hi>

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0085300202:383"/>
occupied a part of this ground, no evidence appears. Camden adopts the name of <hi>Gabroſentum,</hi> which he thinks might be derived from its vicinity to the ſteeps on the oppoſite ſhore of Tyne, as being the haunt of herds of goats.

                  <hi>Gabroſentum</hi> might from the ſame cauſe extend to the cliffs and hills on both ſides of the river.

If there was once a Roman ſtation here, every veſtigia thereof muſt long ſince have been deſtroyed, by the works of a large populous and ancient town. The remains of the <hi>Roman wall,</hi> or wall of <hi>Severus,</hi> have frequently been diſcovered by workmen, in digging the foundations of buildings in thoſe parts of the town through which it lay. It paſſed from the weſt through the Vicarage gardens, the Groat Market, the north part of St. Nicholas's church, and from thence to <hi>Pandon Gate.</hi> This gate bears ſingular marks of antiquity; the ſuperſtructure is of different workmanſhip and model from any others on the town wall; the arches are circular, and there appears that natural decay on the whole ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which might happen in ſuch a number of years. Camden ſays, <q>at Pandon Gate there remains, it is preſumed, one of the turrets of the Roman wall, differing in form and workmanſhip from the others on the walls of the town.</q> By the dimenſions which I took of this gateway, I find it nearly-correſponds with the other ports or gates in the Roman wall. It is ſaid the Carpenters Tower is alſo of Roman ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. The reputed antiquity of <hi>Pandon Gate</hi> is denoted in a proverb of common acceptation: <hi>"As old as Pandon Yates."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have no authorities to fix the certain aera when or by whom this place was firſt inhabited from the evacuation of the Romans, or how long it remained deſerted after their departure: like other ſtrongholds within the defence of the Roman wall, it is reaſonable to conceive it was very early reſorted to by the diſtreſſed Britons, and was kept up by them as a place of ſecurity againſt the northern rovers. The firſt name we find it diſtinguiſhed by in hiſtory was <hi>Monkcheſter,</hi> 
                  <q>which ſhews that it was noted for being the habitation of religious men.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pennant.</note> What ſociety of religious (and whether Saxons or not) took up their
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0085300202:385"/>
reſidence here, at what time they firſt poſſeſſeſſed the place, or when they were expelled, are circumſtances unknown: all the evidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining is the name only. <hi>Bede</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory and Life of St. Cuthbert is totally ſilent relative to them; and as his reſidence was at <hi>Jarrow,</hi> ſituated within a few miles, and he died in 735, the name of <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> and the reſidence of thoſe religious muſt have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his death. Mr Pennant ſays, <q>their deſtruction muſt have been early, for the venerable Bede takes no notice of the place. The ruin therefore of this place cannot be attributed to the Danes, whoſe firſt invaſion did not take place till after the death of that Hiſtorian.</q> It appears to me the argument holds the other way; for had it been the reſidence of any religious ſociety who ſuffered perſecution, before or in the time of <hi>Bede,</hi> he would have noticed it. Fifty-nine years elapſed between the time of <hi>Bede</hi>'s death and the firſt deſcent of the Danes on Northumberland: in this period of time the increaſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houſes was very rapid, and it is reaſonable to conceive ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as <hi>Landisfarn</hi> and <hi>Jarrow</hi> had produced, would greatly promote like inſtitutions in their neighbourhood. From Hollinſhead's authority we are induced to believe, that on the viſitation of <hi>Aldwin, Alfrin,</hi> and <hi>Remfrid,</hi> in 1074, <q>there was not a monaſtery remaining in this part of Northumberland, and ſcarce a church was left ſtanding.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was a deſirable ſituation for the Danes, when they entered the Tyne: and to that aera I am inclined to fix the deſtruction of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſociety which had ſettled here, and from whoſe reſidence the name of <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> was derived.</p>
               <p>In 1080, when <hi>Robert Courthoſe,</hi> the ſon of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from his Scotch expedition, he halted here to refreſh his army; and finding the ſituation proper for a fortreſs to command the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Borderers, and the river well adapted for the reception of ſuccours by ſea, as well as trade, built a <hi>caſtle</hi> here, to which he gave the name of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in contradiſtinction (it is ſaid) to a ſmall circular tower<note n="*" place="bottom">Bourne.</note> which the Monks held, or to the Roman turrets on the wall.</p>
               <p>From this period we may date the growing importance of the place: the protection of a fortreſs on the banks of ſo fine a river, would draw thither a great number of ſetlers, and trade would ſoon begin to flouriſh
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0085300202:386"/>
under ſuch propitious circumſtances. There was ſo rapid a progreſs in its improvements, that before the death of King David I. of Scotland, who held it as a member of his <hi>earldom of Northumberland,</hi> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a place of great importance, David having founded here two monaſteries.<note n="*" place="bottom">Tanner, 391.

                  <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was defended by a ſtrong wall, and an outward ditch of great depth, now much gone to decay. From Leland's account it appears, that this fortification was begun in the reign of King Edward I. and compleated in the reign of King Edward III. A rich citizen hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been taken priſoner in the middle of the town, by the haſty irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a hardy band of Scots, who would not ſet him at liberty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſiderable ſum for his ranſom, on his return he ſet about to ſecure his native place by a wall; his fellow-citizens promoting ſo important a work for the protection of their merchandize and riches. In the 19th year of the reign of King Edward I. the royal licence for fortification was obtained. But it is the opinion of ſome that the northern wall was built in the reign of King John, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of this fortification began from the above event in the reign of Edward I. <note n="†" place="bottom">Grey's Chorograph.</note> The circuit of the wall rather exceeds two miles: <note n="‡" place="bottom">Two miles and 176 yards.</note> it is defended by towers, the chief of which are of a cemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular figure; machicolated towers are intermixed, but not regularly, which project a little over the wall; and there are alſo many guerrets.<note n="‖" place="bottom">They were decorated with the effigies of men cut in ſtone placed on the tops of them as though they were watching.

               <p>PAMPEDON is the next gate, formerly opening upon an ancient town of that name, which was united with Newcaſtle by the grant of King Henry III. A. D. 1299, whereby it was ordained, <q>Et quod praedicta villa Novi caſtri et terrae &amp; tenemen, predict. in Pampedon unica villa etcet. ſunt, et unus Burgus, ad uniend. et concludend. dictam vallam Novi caſtri in emendationem et augmentationem ejus villae, &amp;c.</q> It is ſaid that in <hi>Pampedon</hi> was <hi>a palace of the Saxon Kings of Northumberland.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Carliol Tower</hi> is next, deriving its name, as it is conjectured, from one of the family of <hi>Carliols,</hi> who were ancient burgeſſes here.

               <p>The building of <hi>Nevil Tower</hi> is attributed to one of the great <hi>Nevils, Earls of Weſtmoreland:</hi> their family manſion ſtood near it. This Tower was repaired A. D. 1711, for the <hi>Maſons, Bricklayers, and Plaiſterers</hi> hall.</p>
               <p>In the next place is a <hi>Poſtern,</hi> called <hi>White Friar Gate:</hi> a convenient paſſage for the <hi>Carmelites</hi> or White Friars to and from their monaſtery.</p>
               <p>Not far from thence is the <hi>White Friar Tower,</hi> built on the ſummit of a vaſt eminence above the ſtreet called the <hi>Cloſe:</hi> its form is circular: it is flagged on the top and embrazured; from thence you have the moſt extenſive proſpect any part of theſe fortifications commands: you view the whole of the upper town and great part of the lower, a vaſt

tract of country down the river, and a landſcape as beautiful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive towards the weſt and north as any in this part of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This building is attributed to the Houſe of Carmelites, which ſtood immediately oppoſite: its eminence is ſuch, that from the Cloſe Gate you aſcend to it by 140 ſteps.

               <p>The <hi>Cloſe Gate</hi> is near the preſent extremity of the wall, on the banks of Tyne.

                     <p>The town after the compleating of the walls was divided into 24 wards, according to the number of the gates and round towers in the wall, which towers and gates were wont to be defended in times of hoſtility with the Scots by the particular wards appropriated to them.</p>

               <p>Having deſcribed the walls, I muſt in the next place conſider the interior fortreſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſtle,</hi> all authors agree, was built by <hi>Robert Carthouſe,</hi> ſon of William the Conquerer, in the year 1080, on his return from his Scotch expedition: he perceived the great conſequence of ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs on the frontiers, commanding ſo fine a river, and in a ſituation excellently calculated for aſſembling the northern levies on any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance on the borders. The tower built by <hi>Robert</hi> was of great ſtrength, ſquare, and ſurrounded by two walls: the height of the tower is 82 feet, the ſquare on the outſide 62 feet by 54, the walls 13 feet thick, with galleries gained out of them: there was a chapel within the tower.<note n="†" place="bottom">Pennant.</note> The outward fortifications are now defaced, and their ſcite crowded with buildings. The tower ſtill remains entire, the corners projecting from the plane of the ſquare, a mode much practiced in the Norman ſtructures. It is ſituate on a lofty eminence, commanding the whole town: the principal entrance is on the ſouth. What num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of gates were in the outward wall we cannot now determine, but from Bourne's account of it, which I ſhall quote in its proper place: the area incloſed by this wall contained three acres and one rood. The Caſtle belongs to the county of Northumberland, and makes no part of the liberties of Newcaſtle, or its Sheriffdom: the government of it, 21ſt September, 1ſt of King Henry VII. was granted to William

Cloſe, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for life as Conſtable; and in the 9th year of the ſame reign it was granted to Roger Fenwick, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> with 20l. per annum ſalary; ſince which time I do not find that any Conſtable has been appointed, but the Sheriffs of Northumberland had cuſtody of the Caſtle. It now ſerves for the county priſon, and in the great hall the Judges of aſſize hold the gaol delivery.</p>
               <p>Soon after the building of this caſtle, it is ſaid by Bourne that <hi>Robert de Mowbray</hi> Earl of Northumberland, when in rebellion againſt King William Rufus, was beſieged therein, and this fortreſs after ſuffering much damage was taken: but I confeſs I do not find ſufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to ſupport this aſſertion of my author, and think it is much to be doubted. The Scots by treachery A. D. 1135, in the 1ſt year of the reign of King Stephen, gained poſſeſſion of the caſtle and town, which they held to the year 1156, when Malcolm IV. ceded the northern counties to King Henry II.<note n="*" place="bottom">

The north ſide of the caſtle is the main gate, called now the Black Gate; it had two port culiceſſes, one without the gate, as may be ſtill ſeen, and another within it, at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from it, the ruins of which were to be ſeen a few years ago. There ſtill remains a piece of the old wall, which ſhews its ſituation to have been where that houſe is, which was lately purchaſed by Mr Jaſper Harriſon. The ſhop belonging to this houſe was dug (as I am informed) out of the wall juſt now mentioned. On the eaſt ſide of the caſtle there was a poſtern, which led down to the ſtreet called the Side, which is ſtill to be ſeen: it was once called (but many years
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0085300202:394"/>
after it was in decay) the Waiſt of Laurentius Acton. On the ſouth ſide of the caſtle is another gate, which leads down the Caſtle Stairs to the ſtreet called the Cloſe: this was the ſouth poſtern. There is a building upon it, which was the county Goaler's houſe. On the weſt ſide was the poſtern facing Bailiff Gate; now the dwelling-houſe of James Lidſter.</q>

                  <q>There is an houſe in the yard, which they ſay was the chapel of of the garriſon, which is called the chapel houſe to this day: it ſtands north-eaſt from the chapel; its common name now is the Three Bulls-heads.</q>

               <p>By an inquiſition taken in the reign of King James I. it appears this caſtle was then much out of repair; and in the 18th of the ſame reign another having been taken, complaint was made that a great dunghill, heaped up againſt the wall on the weſt ſide of the caſtle, had done damage to the amount of 120l. it was under the ſame inquiſition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that the great ſquare tower was full of chinks and crannies, and that one-third of it was almoſt taken away; that all the lead and coverings which it had of old, were embezzled and carried off, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the priſoners of the county of Northumberland were moſt miſerably lodged, by reaſon of the ſhowers of rain falling on them. The computation made for repairs was 809l. 15s. In 1644, the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill was taken away by Sir John Morley, and it is ſaid was uſed to make a rampart on the town walls againſt the Scots: he alſo repaired the round tower under the Moothall, now called the Half-moon.<note n="*" place="bottom">Wallis</note>

                  <q>It has been (continues Bourne) a building of great ſtrength, and no little beauty; the vaſt thickneſs of the walls ſpeaks the one, and the ruins of ſome curious workmanſhip the other. The grand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the caſtle was at the gate facing the ſouth, which leads up a pair of ſtairs (which ſtill ſhews the magnificence of the builder) to a very ſtately door of curious maſonry. The room this leads into, has its floor broken down cloſe to the caſtle wall, as indeed all the other floors are, to the top of the caſtle; ſo that excepting the floor above the county gaol, there is not one left, though there have been five diviſions or ſtories of the caſtle, beſides this. This floored room, which I was told was lately flagged by the order of William Elliſon,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0085300202:395"/>
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> when he was Mayor in 1722, ſeems to me, without any doubt, to have been the common hall of the caſtle, becauſe on the north ſide of the ſame room, there is an entrance by a deſcent of ſome ſteps into a room, where is the largeſt fire place I ſaw in the caſtle, which plainly ſpeaks it to have been the kitchen. At the end of this there are ſeveral ſtairs, which lead into a place under the kitchen, which I think goes down as low as the bottom of the caſtle: this I take to have been a cellar, as I do alſo that little dark place on the right hand coming up again, to have been a ſort of pantry. The door I mentioned juſt now on the eaſt of the caſtle, which leads to the firſt broken down floor, is becauſe of its grandeur and beauty, an argument that this room has been the moſt ſtately one in the whole caſtle: another reaſon for its being ſo is, becauſe of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows which gave light into it; thoſe of them that face the eaſt are the moſt beautiful of the whole caſtle beſide. On the ſouth of this room there is an entrance into a ſort of a parlour or withdrawing room, which has a fire place in it, and has been a piece of curious workmanſhip, as is viſible to this day; and this place has no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with any part of the caſtle but this room. On the north ſide of this room, is a door leading into an apartment where ſtands a well of conſiderable depth; it was 18 yards before we touched the ſurface of the water; which ſeems to have been placed there on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the more immediate ſervice of this room. There are ſome little baſons on the top of the well, with pipes leading from them, which conveyed water to different apartments of the caſtle: this is plain from what may be obſerved in the county gaol, at the bottom of the caſtle; the round ſtone pillar in it having an hollow in the middle, of a foot wide, with a lead ſpout in the ſide of it.</q>

                  <q>In the inquiſition made in the 9th of King Edward III. above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, among other things that were complained of for being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, one was, Capella Domini Regis infra caſtrum. This chapel, I have been told, ſtood on that part of the caſtle yard where the Moot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall is; but upon ſearching, I found it in the caſtle itſelf, according to the account of it juſt now mentioned. The door of it is at the bottom of the ſouth wall of the caſtle, adjoining to the ſtairs which lead into the ſtate chamber. It has been a work of great beauty and ornament, and is ſtill, in the midſt of duſt and darkneſs, by far the moſt beautiful place in the whole building; the inſide of it being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly adorned with arches and pillars. It is eaſy to obſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

parts of it, the entrance, the body of it, and the chancel: on the left ſide of the entrance you go into a dark little room, which undoubtedly was the veſtry; the full length of it was 15 yards, the breadth ſix yards and a half; it had three or four windows towards the eaſt, which are now all filled up; nor is there any light but what comes in at a little cranny in the wall. Nicholas de Byker tenet terras ſuas, ut faciat diſtrictiones ad Ward. novi caſtri ſuper Tynam faciend. et pro deb. Domini regis inter Tynam et Coquet, &amp;c. and then my authority goes on to ſay, that the manor of Byker was Sir Ralph Lawſon's, Knt. deceaſed, after of Henry Lawſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his ſon, and now of his eldeſt ſon, who without all queſtion is Bailiff by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the ſaid caſtle, and is to levy theſe caſtle wards, cornages, &amp;c. and other rents, iſſues, fines, and amerciaments belonging to the ſaid caſtle.</q>

               <p>In the year 1737, 10 King George II. the ſcite and demeſnes of the caſtle were granted to George Liddell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for 50 years, from 2 July, 1736: rent 100 chaldron of coals for Greenwich Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>The next ſubjects of antiquity to be attended to are the Religious Foundations.

               <p>
                  <q>When was the particular time of its building, I have met with no account; but it is not difficult to give a probable gueſs. The order itſelf, of the Dominicans or Black Friars, came into England in the year 1221; conſequently it muſt have been founded after that time: and that it muſt have been founded ſome years before the year 1280, is plain to a demonſtration; for in that year, which was the 8th of King Henry I. the Black Friars had licence from the King, to break a door through this new or town wall into their garden; which proves them a regular ſettled body at that time; and therefore that their priory was built ſome years before that licence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We are told that this monaſtery was in old time called the Grey Friars, which, in my opinion, is a thing highly improbable; for the Grey Friars or Franciſcans came not into England till about the year 1224; and if, as I have proved above, the Black Friars were a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled body ſome years before 1280, how is it poſſible, to have been called of old time, the Grey Friars? This is therefore a miſtake: and beſides, the Dominicans came into England before the Franciſcans or Grey Friars, and therefore more probably were ſooner in this place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It has been a very ſtately building, as appears by the preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it. The area or graſs plot is about 87 feet in length, and as many in breadth. On the eaſt ſide of it was the chapel, which is now the hall of the company of Smiths in this town. On the weſt ſide of it, is a curious old well, which ſerved the monaſtery with water, called our Lady's Well. On the ſouth may ſtill be ſeen, the ruins of a curious front, on which ſide is the hall of the Cordwainers; in which I ſaw a pair of winding ſtairs, which they told me (before they were walled up) led by a vault as far as the nunnery of St. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew. On the north of it were their gardens, a part of which was the Warden's Cloſe, before the building of that part of the town wall. This appears by the charter granted to the monaſtery in the reign of Edward I. about the breaking out that narrow gate in the wall between Weſtgate and Newgate; in which grant it is ſaid, that the wall went through the middle of their garden. The monaſtery was dependant on the priory of Tynemouth.</q>

                  <q>In the reign of Edward II. the brethren of this monaſtery had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence granted them for the building of a draw bridge beyond the new ditch of the caſtle.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Who were the Priors of this monaſtery; what eminent men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them; or what things were tranſacted by them from their beginning till their diſſolution; were things undoubtedly preſerved among themſelves whilſt they were a body; but after their ſurrender, were either deſtroyed, or have not yet come to light.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>One of the Priors of this monaſtery was one Richard Marſhall. I take this gentleman to have been the laſt Prior of this monaſtery; for in the 28th of King Henry VIII. a grant of a tenement near the White Croſs (ſigned by Friar Richard Marſhall, Doctor and Prior; and Friar David Simpſon, and Friar John Sourby) was given to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Godſalve, upon his paying to the ſaid priory or monaſtery 9s. per annum. This grant is now in the poſſeſſion of Mr Thomas Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of Newcaſtle, Joiner, who purchaſed this tenement, and has lately rebuilt it. He pays the ſame rent to the town of Newcaſtle, which the tenement paid to the monaſtery. About two years after the ſigning of this deed, in January, the 30th of this reign, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery ſurrendered. It conſiſted of a Prior and 12 Friars.</q>

                  <q>What became of the brethren of this friary, after their ſurrender; what they had allowed them annually for a maintenance; or whether they had any thing allowed at all does not appear. Some account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I met with afterwards of the Prior himſelf, but none of the Friars.</q> It is this which follows.</p>

                  <q>Richard Marſhall, Prior of the Black Friars in Newcaſtle about the year 1551, went into Scotland and preached at St. Andrew's, that the Pater-noſter ſhould be addreſt to God and not to the Saints. Some Doctors of the univerſity being diſguſted at this aſſertion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with one Tofts, a Grey Friar, to undertake to prove that the Pater-noſter might be ſaid to the Saints; whoſe ignorance in doing the ſame was ſo manifeſt, that he became the common jeſt, and quitted the town.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After the ſurrender of this monaſtery, the Black Friars was granted to the town of Newcaſtle, in conſideration of 53l. 7s. 6d. The annual value of it was 2l. 19s. 6d.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:0085300202:401"/>
                  <q>The King ſays in his grant, that he gives to the Mayor and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of Newcaſtle, the whole houſe and ſcite lately a priory, or houſe of brethren, called vulgarly the Black Friars, in Newcaſtle upon Tyne; the chapel-houſes, edifices, gardens, &amp;c. the hall, two chambers, a chamber called the Croſs Chamber; and two gardens with their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances; and the whole cloſe within the Weſtgate, and another cloſe near the ſcite of the ſaid priory, on the north; and a cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining three acres, and a houſe in the ſame cloſe, without the walls of the ſaid town; and a houſe called the Gatehouſe ſituated near the ſaid ſtreet. It alſo appears from the firſt grant, that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelf and ſucceſſors the bells and lead that was upon the church belonging to this friary, and the other buildings of it; the lead in the gutters, together with the ſtones and iron of the church, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Nine Crafts of this town had their meeting-houſes or halls in it, and ſtill have except two of them, the Taylors and the Cordwainers, who have beſtowed theſe upon ſome poor widows, and got themſelves others in their places. Theſe halls are of great ſervice to this ancient building, in preſerving it from intire ruin. Such is the hall of the Smiths, which was repaired by them in the year 1709: the hall of the Dyers; the hall of the Bakers and Brewers, which was repaired by them in the year 1711: theſe halls are on the eaſt ſide of the friary. Such alſo are thoſe on the weſt ſide of it, viz. the hall of the Sadlers, which was repaired by them in the year 1729, and the hall of the Skinners and Glovers, which was repaired by them in the year 1721. Such are thoſe alſo on the ſouth ſide of it, viz. the Cordwainers hall, which was turned into apartments for three widows in the year 1729: the hall of the Butchers and the hall of the Tanners were repaired in the year 1717.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>By the means of theſe halls, there is ſtill ſome viſage of the friary remaining, which had otherwiſe been intirely in duſt. 'Tis a pity that thoſe people, who are permitted by the companies to reſide in ſome of thoſe rooms, are not threatened into more cleanlineſs;<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſtill remains a matter of complaint, for it is abominably filthy; and the curious paſs through it amidſt thoſe unſeemly annoyance of which ſome animals are peculiarly delicate in their concealment.</note> and that the companies themſelves are not at the expence of repairing the area. Were theſe things done, it would be a beautiful piece of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0085300202:402"/>
and the entertainment of the curious, from whence ſoever they come.</q>

               <p>By Tanner's Notitia it appears, that King David I. of Scotland, who was poſſeſſed of Newcaſtle as Earl of Northumberland, founded here two monaſteries and a nunnery: but whether any of the before mentioned own their riſe to him, no evidence remains. He died A. D. 1153.</p>
               <p>Patents were made out for founding two other religious houſes; one 37 King Edward III. in honour of the nativity and reſurrection of our Lord, which was repealed; and another, 5 King Henry IV. in honour of St. John Baptiſt and St. John Evangeliſt, which latter was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed or otherwiſe proved abortive.<note n="*" place="bottom">Wall 211.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe religious foundations, there were ſeveral on a more meritorious plan—hoſpitals for the benevolent purpoſe of relieving the miſeries of human life. When that dreadful diſtemper the leproſy raged here, the great and opulent, from true principles of religion and piety, erected thoſe places of conſolation and relief for miſerable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, who were expelled from ſociety on account of this horrible viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. King Henry I. founded an hoſpital here for the reception of lepers, called the Hoſpital of St. Mary Magdalen, ſituated near Barras Bridge, without Pilgrim-ſtreet Gate, and therein fixed a Maſter, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſters. After that malady abated, or was ſubdued, it was appropriated for the reception of poor perſons, when the town was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with a peſtilence—a dreadful ſcourge, which the Almighty has now withheld from this land for a conſiderable time. On ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, 14 within the houſe were allowed each a room, 8s. per month, and coals: 15 without the houſe had different allowances, according to the ſtate of their wants; ſome 8s. per month, ſome 5s. others 2s. 6d. In the reign of King Edward III. Laurentius Acton had the firſt fruits, amounting annually to 200 marks; one John Bland was then Maſter, and was a conſiderable patron to this foundation, having built the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and ornamented the chapel. He died A. D. 1374, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in his own chapel, near the high altar, after having preſided over the hoſpital five years. It was a donative in the patronage of the Corporation, and ſtood without Pilgrim-ſtreet Gate, near the Barras

It was beſides inſtituted as an aſylum for the helpleſs ſtranger and indigent traveller, a receptacle to the ſick and needy, and to give ſepulture to ſuch as died there.

                     <p>A ſtate of the Lectureſhips from the Manuſcripts of Dr. Ch. Hunter.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that Pearſon, Lecturer of St. Nicholas about 1606, was paid quarterly a ſalary out of the town of Newcaſtle, and likewiſe for ſeveral years after during his continuance.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that Shaw was about 1614 Lecturer of St. John's, and had a ſalary quarterly paid him out of the town, and the like for ſeveral years after during his continuance.</p>
                     <p>Fran. Grey, about 1622, was Lecturer of St. Andrew's, and had alſo a ſalary quarterly paid him out of the town, and the like for ſeveral years after during his continuance.</p>
                     <p>There were Lecturers of All ſaints about the ſame time, as Dr. Jenniſon and others, who had alſo a ſalary paid them out of the town, and continued in the like manner till the late civil wars.</p>
                     <p>The ſalaries were not one and the ſame, but added and increaſed as the town thought fit. Upon this firſt ſettlement they had thoſe ſalaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon, and the pariſhes contributed for their preaching in the afternoons. Some time after the town of Newcaſtle made an addition to the former ſalaries, and gave them an allowance for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both forenoon and afternoon: after which augmentation the pariſhes gave no further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution. In this ſtate have the Lectureſhips continued ever ſince, with an alteration ſtill of ſalaries, more or leſs, as there was occaſion, and at the will and pleaſure of the patrons: and when any vacancy happened in any of the ſaid churches, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of Newcaſtle, have from time to time choſen another in ſuch room and ſtead, and the Biſhop of Durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of, by his licence, ſuch perſon ſo choſen, being duly qualified.—Note the Lecturers of St. Nicholas and All-ſaints have this further advantage in it, which makes it the more valuable, that this preferment does no ways diſqualify or incapacitate them from holding other livings with the cure of ſouls</p>

This image was wont to have the Virgin Mary on one ſide, and St John on the other. Savely's Church Hiſt. p. 199.</p>

               <p>The grammar ſchool was founded by Thomas Horſley, Mayor of Newcaſtle, A. D. 1525: he endowed it with lands of a conſiderable yearly value. Queen Elizabeth confirmed this foundation, or rather refounded it by charter. The great tithes of the pariſh of Bolham ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain

               <p>The charity ſchool of the pariſh of St. Nicholas was opened in 1709, for the teaching and cloathing of 40 boys and 20 girls, of this pariſh and the chapelry of St John's. The boys are placed out to buſineſs, and have on ſuch their going out a gift of certain religious books and 40s. in money. The girls are placed out to ſervice, and have a like gift of books and 20s. in money. The Schoolmaſter's ſalary is 25l. and 20s. for coals yearly. The Miſtreſs has 10l. and 10s. for coals.</p>
               <p>This ſchool was originally founded by Mrs Eleanor Allan, a widow of Newcaſtle, and endowed with lands of 60l. a year value. Mrs Criſhold, the widow of the Rev. Mr Criſhold of Wooler, added a donation of 500l. By a parochial ſubſcription the children are cloathed on the 1ſt day of May yearly.</p>
               <p>The charity ſchool belonging to the pariſh of All-ſaints is ſupported by ſubſcription, which was begun A. D. 1709. It receives 41 boys and 17 girls, and is conducted as the ſchool of St. Nicholas.</p>
               <p>The charity ſchool of the pariſh of St. Andrew was founded by Sir William Blackett, Baronet, for 30 boys, and was opened A. D. 1707: the Schoolmaſter's ſalary 20l. a year.</p>
               <p>The charity ſchool of the pariſh of St. John was founded in the year 1705, by John Ord, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for 44 boys. He endowed it with lands near Pilgrim-ſtreet Gate. Mrs Margaret Allgood gave thereto 100l. The boys are cloathed annually on Midſummer-day, by ſubſcription. The Schoolmaſter's ſalary is 24l. a year, and 40s. for teaching them to ſing; with an additional allowance of 16s. a year for pens, ink, and paper.</p>

               <p>The Town Houſe and Exchange, on the Sandhill, originally founded by Roger de Thornton. In the year 1658, this public edifice was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built by the Corporation on the preſent plan;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Exchange contains a variety of apartments, and alſo the Courts of juſtice for the town. Is of the architecture of the period of James I.

The ſtatue was ſaid to be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent workmanſhip, and coſt 1700l. An elegant plate was publiſhed of it in 1742.</p>
               <p>The Trinity Houſe at the Head of the Broad Chair: In it are apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for 14 perſons, to whom 8s. per month with coals and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are given: it alſo contains a ſpacious hall and a neat chapel.

The original inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the order of the Holy Trinity was in 1198, in the time of Pope Innocent III. and was for the redemption of captives from ſlavery. The Trinity Houſe we are now ſpeaking of appertains to the fraternity of Mariners, who have received three ſeveral royal charters; one in the 3d year of King James I. the ſecond by King Charles II. 1664, and the third by King James II. 1687.<note n="*" place="bottom">Randal.</note>

               <p>Daviſon's Hoſpital, for ſix widows of Clergymen or Merchants. The building was erected at the expence of the Corporation, and the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made by Mrs Ann Daviſon, the relict of a Merchant of this town. The allowance to each is 40s. quarterly.</p>

               <p>The Maidens Hoſpital, built by the Corporation in 1753, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by a donation of 1200l. from Thomas Daviſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Ferry-hill, in the county of Durham, and his ſiſters; and the like ſum of 1200l. from the munificent Sir Walter Blackett—for the reception of ſix maiden women and ſix poor men.</p>
               <p>The Keelmen's Hoſpital, a ſquare building with cloiſters, near Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, built in 1701, by a contribution of 1d. each tide from every Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man plying upon the Tyne, within the liberties of Newcaſtle. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains upwards of 50 chambers, but is ſaid to be neglected, and without endowment. It is wonderful this laborious and uſeful race of men, whoſe toils help to contribute ſuch immenſe wealth to Newcaſtle, ſhould not have claimed the attention of the Corporation, from whoſe revenue more donations iſſue in charitable and religious appropriations, than any other Corporation in the North of England can boaſt.</p>
               <p>The Infirmary ſtands in an airy elevated ſituation behind Weſtgate, and near the public walk called the Forth: It was founded by ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the relief of the ſick and lame of Newcaſtle and the counties of Durham and Northumberland. To this excellent foundation Sir Walter Blackett gave 1000l. out of the intereſt money ariſing from which donation, he appointed 10l. a year ſhould be given to a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to do duty there. So happy a relief has this charitable inſtitution proved, that from the time of its commencement to April 1778, 17,331 patients have been diſcharged cured.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added the Hoſpital for Lunatics, and the Hoſpital for Married Women lying-in: as alſo the fund raiſed for the ſupport of thoſe who lie-in at their own houſes.</p>

                  <hi>An elegant Hall</hi> has lately been erected in High Friar Chair, by the ſociety of <hi>Free and Accepted Maſons</hi> of the Lodge of St. John: it is richly ornamented, and has an excellent organ for their ſolemn rites. It was dedicated in the year 1777; to attend which ceremony, there was the moſt reſpectable and numerous convention of that order that ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the northern parts of this kingdom. The muſic was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by an excellent band, the vocal parts of which were done by the beſt voices from the quire of Durham cathedral. A pathetic exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was delivered by Mr Huntley, and an elegant oration, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the antiquity, progreſs, and excellence of the order, by the Rev. Dr Scott of Simonburn. The feſtival was held in the new aſſembly room, when at three tables near 400 of the brethren dined together; at which time that regularity, order and harmony were maintained, for which this ſociety, above all others in the world, is remarkable: where men of all ranks, political opinions, and religious perſuaſions meet, without envy or contention; and preſerve a unanimity and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, in deſpite of the frailties and fickleneſs of the human heart.</p>
               <p>The hiſtory of this place is very dark, antecedent to the time of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Carthouſe, and the building of the caſtle, from whence it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the name of Newcaſtle was derived. The advantages of a fine navigable river, with a ſituation defended by ſo ſtrong a fortreſs, would ſoon induce Merchants and others to fix there; yet we find no record of any royal charter, liberty, or franchiſe granted to the ſettlers, till the reign of King Henry II. when they obtained a royal charter, which is ſaid to have comprehended great privileges;<note n="*" place="bottom">Gardiner, ch. 2. p. 7.</note> but of what nature theſe were, our author is ſilent. King John, in the 3d year of his reign, confirmed the above charter, on payment of 100 marks and two palfreys.<note n="†" place="bottom">Madox Firma Burgi, p. 54.</note> In the 14th year of his reign he greatly enlarged thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and powers, and expreſsly <q>in conſideration of the loyalty and faithful ſervices of his burgeſſes there,</q> he granted them ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive privileges; among which are, an exemption from the power of the Sheriff of the county at large, and that they ſhould be amenable to the Courts only within their own juriſdiction, except in matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the rights of the Crown.

But that neither the ſentence of deprivation, nor the Queen's letters patents were of ſufficient force to recover the honours, lands, &amp;c. to the See of Durham; therefore to reſtore the Biſhoprick to its former intereſt, privileges, and revenues, the two diſſolution ſtatutes of the laſt reign are hereby repealed."</note>

It was then declared to be a free town, with power to the corporate body to purchaſe lands to them and their ſucceſſors in fee and perpetuity, and to grant and demiſe the ſame; and that they ſhould have a common ſeal: that they ſhould exerciſe an Admiralty Juriſdiction within their own liberties, excluſive of any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Lord High Admiral.</p>

               <p>A common Drunkard was led through the ſtreets as a ſpectacle of contempt, covered with a large barrel, called a Newcaſtle cloak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one end being out, and the other having a hole made through it, ſufficient for the offender to paſs his head through; by which means the veſſel was reſted on his ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>The Scold wore an iron engine, called the branks, in the form of a crown; it covered the head, but left the face expoſed; and having a tongue of iron which went into the mouth, conſtrained ſilence from the moſt violent brawler.</p>
               <p>The trade of this place is very great: to enter upon an exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, would exceed the limits of my work: the exports chiefly conſiſt of coals, wrought iron, lead, glaſs, ſalt, bacon, corn, ſalmon, butter, tallow, and grindſtones: its ſituation is ſuch, as neceſſarily renders it the place of ſupply for an extenſive country, in articles of imported merchandize. In the ſummary I have given of the trade of the county in the ſucceeding pages, the importance of this place will appear.

                     <p>In the 31ſt year of that reign, a complaint was made of the public nuiſance the burning of coal was in the city and ſuburbs of London, by corrupting the air by the ſtink and ſmoke, and a proclamation was iſſued to prohibit its uſe; and afterwards a Commiſſion of Oyer to puniſh thoſe who uſed it, in defiance of the proclamation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Queen Elizabeth granted a charter to the Fraternity called Free Hoſtmen for the vending of Coals, reſerving a duty of 12d a chaldron.</p>

                     <p>The quantity of a Ten of coals is uncertain, and not always the ſame, but commonly 16 Newcaſtle chaldrons make a ten. Two keels alſo make a ten, and 11 waggons a keel. Each waggon contains 19 bolls and upwards, at 36 gallons to a boll, and 9 bolls or thereabouts go to a fother, and three fothers and a quarter make a chaldron; 21 corves to a ſcore, and 55 fother make a ten.</p>
                     <p>A ſquare yard of ſolid coal contains eight bolls.</p>
                     <p>An acre of ground contains 4840 ſquare yards of ſolid coal, which is near equal to 68 tens, at 16 chaldrons to a ten, which is near equal to 1088 chaldrons of coals.</p>
                     <p>Three ſquare yards and a quarter go to a chalder.</p>

Near 500 of theſe

               <p>The collieries which ſupply this exportation, about 24 in number, lie at conſiderable diſtances from the river. From the mines, the coals are ſent to the places of lading in large unwieldy carriages or waggons, of the form of a common mill-hopper, carried on four wheels of iron, the fellies or rims of which are hollow, ſo as to run upon ſtrings of wood adapted thereto, with which the roads are laid. By this means, theſe carriages on an eaſy deſcent run without horſes, and ſometimes with that rapidity, that a piece of wood, called a tiller, is obliged to be applied to one wheel, and preſſed thereon by the weight of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant who ſits on it, to retard the motion: by the friction of which frequently the tiller and ſometimes the carriage is ſet on fire.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the year 1775, 697, 608 chaldrons of coals were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the port of London from Newcaſtle, and Sunderland on the the river Wear, in the county of Durham; which is 37,237 chaldrons more than the year 1773, and 77,237 chaldrons more than in the year 1774. In the year 1776, 600,000 chaldrons were imported at London.<note n="*" place="bottom">A manuſcript note in the margin of Bourne's Hiſtory of Newcaſtle, in Fiſher's Circulating Library, p. 159.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In 1775, 4773 ſhips were cleared at the Cuſtom-houſe of Newcaſtle; of which 4343 were coaſtways, and 430 for foreign parts; being upon the whole 270 leſs than in the year 1774.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>The great export of this place is coal, for which it has been noted for ſome centuries. It is not exactly known at what time that ſpecies of fuel was firſt dug. It is probable that it was not very early in general uſe. That the Romans ſometimes made uſe of it appears in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer volume, p. 55: but ſince wood was the fuel of their own country, and Britain was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with foreſts, it was not likely that they would pierce into the bowels of the earth for a leſs grateful kind. But it was exported to foreign parts long before it was in uſe in London; for London likewiſe had its neighbouring foreſts. We find that in 1234, King Henry III. confirms to the good people of Newcaſtle, the charter of his father King John, granting them the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of digging coals in the Caſtle Moor, and converting them to their own profit, in aid of their fee-farm rent of one hundred a year; which moor was afterwards granted to them in property by Edward III. The time of the firſt exportation of coals to London does not appear. In 1307, the 35th year of Edward I. they were conſidered in the capital as a nuiſance; for on the repeated complaints of Prelates, Nobles, Commons of Parliament, and Inhabitants of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, againſt the ſtench and ſmoke of coals uſed by Brewers, Dyers, and other Artificers, the King iſſued out his proclamation againſt the uſe of them: which being diſregarded, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Oyer and Terminer was iſſued, to puniſh the diſobedient with fines for the firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and for the ſecond, by the deſtruction of their furnaces. In 1379, we find that their uſe was not only tolerated, but their conſumption made beneficial to the ſtate; for in that year a duty of ſix-pence per ten each quarter of a year was impoſed on ſhips coming from Newcaſtle. In 1421, the trade became ſo important as to engage the regulations of government, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were given about the lengths of the keels, ſo that the quantity of coal might be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. From that period the commerce advanced continually.

This ceremony was ſoon after performed on St. Andrew's day; after which Baliol paſſing into England, did homage to King Edward on Chriſtmas day at Newcaſtle, in the hall of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>In the year 1296, an open rupture taking place between the two kingdoms, the Scots profeſſing to throw off the Engliſh yoke, King Edward appointed the 1ſt day of March for his rendezvous at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,

               <p>King Edward III. having placed Edward Baliol on the throne of Scotland, kept his Whitſuntide, A. D. 1334, at Newcaſtle, with great ſplendour and magnificence. In the month of June, in quality of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord of Scotland, he received there, in a public and ſolemn manner, the fealty and homage of the Scotch King: at the ſame time Baliol ceded to him large Scotch territories, in ſatisfaction of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences ſuſtained in reſtoring the Crown to him, as its hereditary claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. By the following paſſage in Lel. Col. vol.

               <p>Through the interpoſition of the King of France, Edward conſented to a truce with David Bruce's party, who had oppoſed Edward Baliol; on the expiration of which, about Midſummer 1335, both Kings held their rendezvous at Newcaſtle with a powerful army, preparatory to their entry into Scotland.</p>
               <p>In the year 1336, King Edward met the Scotch Delegates at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, when he acceded to propoſals made by the Pope's Nuncio, for a further time of truce.</p>

John Lord Nevil, who commanded in the caſtle, made a ſally with 200 choſen lancemen, who entering the Scotch camp, ſurprized the Earl of Murray, one of the chief in command, in bed, and dragged him forth naked, returning to the caſtle with their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner

and much booty, not having loſt one man. The Scotch enraged at the diſgrace, began a fierce but irregular attack, and were repulſed with great ſlaughter. The bravery of the garriſon induced David to raiſe the ſiege and march towards Durham, which city he took by ſtorm, and with the moſt ſavage barbarity put the inhabitants to the ſword, without diſtinction of age, ſex, or condition.<note n="*" place="bottom">Barns's Hiſt.

               <p>King James I. on the 9th of April 1603, entered Newcaſtle in his progreſs to the capital, and remained three days there. He granted the Burgeſſes a confirmatory charter by letters patent dated 31 March, 1604.</p>
               <p>In the time of King Charles I. A. D. 1643, Newcaſtle ſuſtained a ſiege, the Scotch advancing againſt it under the command of Leſley, who dividing the forces, attacked it vigorouſly on two ſides at once. The Marquis of Newcaſtle, then Governor for the King, maintained the place, though the enemy gained part of the outworks; and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſallies were made. In the ſucceeding year the Scots took it by ſtorm. Sir John Merlay then Mayor retired to the caſtle with about 500 men, which he held till terms of capitulation were obtained. The inhabitants ſaved the town from being plundered by payment of a large ſum of money. The Parliament disfranchiſed the body corporate, and ordered the Mayor to be tried by a court martial.

               <p>The ancient bridge was of wood and in the 33d year of the reign of King Henry III. was deſtroyed by fire. The late bridge was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of ſtone, and conſiſted of 12 arches; three of which on the north were cloſed up and uſed as cellars. It was built about 500 years ago, Walter Kirkham,<note n="*" place="bottom">He came to the See 1249.</note> Biſhop of Durham, being a great contributor thereto.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>The original ſuperſtructure of this bridge was probably of wood, like that over the Danube, and continued made with the ſame material for ſeveral centuries. Notice is taken of it in the reign of King Richard I. when Philip Poictiers, Biſhop of Durham, gave licence to the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of Gateſhead to give wood to whomſoever they pleaſed to be ſpent about the river Tyne; which is ſuppoſed to mean in the repairs of the bridge and quay on the part belonging to Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; for one third belongs to the Biſhop, and two to the town; ſo that after it was deſtroyed in 1248 by a furious fire, the Biſhop and the town united in the expence of building the ſtone bridge, of which this calamity was the origin. The Prelate (Walter Kirkham) had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this; for, armed with ſpiritual powers, he iſſued out indulgences from all penances to every one that would aſſiſt, either with money or labour. The town alſo applied to other Biſhops for their aſſiſtance in promoting ſo good a work, and they in conſequence granted their indulgences; but then the Clergy of the North were directed by their Archdeacon, to prefer the indulgences; of their own Prelate to any other. In the end both parties ſucceeded, and the money raiſed was given to Laurentius, Maſter of the Bridge.

                  </note> It was crowded with buildings. Near the middle was a tower with an iron gate, which the Corporation uſed as a town priſon. This tower was of conſiderable ſervice ſome years ago, in preventing the further communication of a fire which conſumed many houſes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining it. At the ſouth end was formerly another tower and a draw-bridge. A blue ſtone near the middle of the bridge denoted the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of the town's liberty, the ſouthern end of the bridge appertaining to the See of Durham. In the year 1416, a claim of the Corporation to the whole bridge occaſioned a ſuit, in which the right of the Biſhop of Durham to the ſouthern part was eſtabliſhed. Thomas Ruthal, Biſhop of Durham in the reign of King Henry VII. repaired the ſouthern part.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>This part of the bridge was repaired by Thomas Ruthal, Biſhop of Durham, famous in the reigns of King Henry VII. and VIII. not only for being the richeſt ſubject then in Britain, but for the unfortunate miſtake he made in delivering the book of his own private affairs to the aſpiring Cardinal Wolſey, inſtead of one he had wrote on the ſtate of the kingdom by the deſire of his Sovereign, whereby the Cardinal effected his ruin and ſtepped into his Biſhoprick.

with this motto, <hi>Adventus Regis, Solamen Gregis.</hi> There was an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the battlements of the bridge railed with iron, for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of paſſengers to look upon the river and ſhipping: Mr Bourne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates a ſtory, that from thence one <hi>Anderſon,</hi> an Alderman, dropt his ſignet ring into the river; that ſome time afterwards his own ſervant having bought a ſalmon for his table, in opening the fiſh the ring was found in its intrails, and was in his days in the cuſtody of a deſcendant of Mr Anderſon. <hi>Herodotus</hi> gives an account of a ſimilar circumſtance happening to <hi>Polycrates</hi> King of <hi>Samos,</hi> who was called <hi>the favourite of Fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 20th of June 1770, the workmen began to pull down the weſt end of St. Thomas's chapel, in order to open the paſſage to the bridge.</p>
               <p>In the inundation 11th Nov. 1771, the water was ſuppoſed to be at its height about ſeven in the morning, and to have riſen upwards of 12 feet above high water mark in ſpring tides. From Tyne Head, in Aldſton Moor, to Shields, was a continued ſcene of horror and devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>An act of parliament paſſed 3d June 1772, to enable the Biſhop of Durham and his ſucceſſors to raiſe a competent ſum of money, to be applied for the repairing, improving, or rebuilding ſuch part of Tyne Bridge as belongs to the See of Durham.</p>
               <p>On the 10th June 1772, one Stephenſon contracted to build a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary bridge over the Tyne in four months time, under a great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; which was performed.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday 25th April 1775, the firſt ſtone of the ſouth pier of the new bridge, within the boundaries of this Corporation, was laid by Sir Matthew White Ridley, Mayor.</p>
               <p>From the evidence of the ancient name of Pons Aelii and the Roman road from Cheſter leading thereto, it is conjectured that the Romans had a bridge here.</p>
               <p>Mr Pennant is of opinion, <q>that part of the Roman bridge remained till the late inundation; for from the obſervation of workmen upon the old piers, thoſe as well as the piers of the bridge at Bywell, ſeem originally to have been formed without any ſprings for arches. This
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0085300202:445"/>
was a manner of building uſed by the Romans, witneſs the bridge built over the Danube by Trajan at Severin, whoſe piers (he believes) ſtill exiſt. Adrian was probably the founder of the bridge at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, which was called after his family name Pons Aelii, in the ſame manner as Jeruſalem was ſtyled Elia Capitolina, and the games he inſtituted at Pincum in Maeſia, Aeliana Pincenſia. The coins diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered on pulling down ſome of the piers in 1774, confirm my opinion. Several were diſcovered, but only three or four reſcued from the hands of the workmen. All of them are coins poſterior to the time of Adrian, probably depoſited there in ſome later repairs. One of them is a beautiful Fauſtina the Elder after her deification. Her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is bound with a ſmall tiara; her hair full, twiſted and dreſſed <hi>a la moderne;</hi> round is inſcribed Diva Fauſtina. On the reverſe is <hi>Ceres,</hi> with a torch in one hand and ears of corn in the other. The inſcription <hi>Auguſta S. C.</hi>

                        <q>A Roman <hi>Sudatory</hi> was diſcovered a few years ago, in a field eaſt of the houſe, the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not in chequer work or Moſaic, but in unequal irregular figures, red and white; a compoſition of <hi>Caluviva</hi> and brick, reſembling a pebble marble. Of the true Muſive or Moſaic, I have not heard of any yet being diſcovered in the Roman ſtructures of this or the other ſtations with us; though I make no queſtion but the Romans of quality had them here, as well as in the more ſouthern ſtations of Britain. They are of great antiquity, invented by the luxurious <hi>Aſiatics,</hi> the builders of <hi>Babylon,</hi> of <hi>Palmyra,</hi> of <hi>Perſaepolis,</hi> of the famous <hi>Piramids</hi> of <hi>Memphis,</hi> the juſt wonders of the world.

Montſaucon</hi> has given us one image of this deity, found at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> clad in armour, and ſtanding upon a <hi>bull,</hi> which ſeems to agree very well with this account; but another image repreſents him in a ruſtic habit, with an <hi>ox</hi> under him; and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> who calls him <gap reason="foreign">

Mr Ward</hi> chuſes to read the third and fourth lines thus: <hi>Numerius Soſius Senecio Nepos Conſulis Felix.</hi> The letter <hi>N</hi> put for a <hi>praenomen</hi> ſignifies <hi>Numerius,</hi> according to <hi>Diomedes. Soſius</hi> was one of the conſuls names, who is called <hi>G. Soſius Senecio</hi> in the <hi>Faſti Conſulares,</hi> and <hi>N</hi> for <hi>Nepos</hi> is very common upon inſcriptions: as to the ſituation of the words <hi>Nepos Conſulis,</hi> 'tis uſual in inſcriptions to inſert ſuch words as expreſs any relation or other circumſtance of thoſe who erect them, before the laſt name: but <hi>N S</hi> in <hi>Goltzins</hi> is made to ſtand for <hi>Numerius,</hi> as well as <hi>N</hi> alone. This being admitted, we may read <hi>Numerius Senecio Nepos Conſulis Felix:</hi> but I much incline to the reading that I have given, which occurred to me at the firſt: 'tis evident that no regard is had in this inſcription to the uſual order of the words in others; there ſeems rather to be an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſingularity as to this matter. <hi>Senecio,</hi> who is mentioned in an inſcription or two found at <hi>Brugh</hi> in <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> (the originals of which are now loſt was probably of the ſame family, though rather too late to be the ſame perſon with him who is deſcribed in this monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he (as appears from theſe inſcriptions I have referred to) lived under the reign of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and continued at leaſt till the joint reign of <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Caracalla,</hi> is later than a grandſon of <hi>Soſius Senecio</hi> the conſul can well be ſuppoſed to have lived; for <hi>Soſius Senecio</hi> was the fourth and laſt time conſul in conjunction with <hi>Licinius Sura</hi> in the year 107, under the reign of <hi>Trojan,</hi> from whence to the beginning of the joint reign of <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Caracalla</hi> is little leſs than a <hi>century;</hi> for the ſame reaſon it is not ſo probable that the two Emperors here intended are <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Caracalla,</hi> but rather <hi>Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus,</hi> who, as well as the others, carried on a war with ſucceſs againſt the <hi>Britons,</hi> and <hi>Calpurnius Agricola</hi> was their <hi>Legate,</hi> whoſe name we meet with in ſome inſcriptions found near the Roman wall, and as he began to reign jointly above thirty years before the other two, that time ſuits better than the other: ſo that upon the whole I take this monument to have been erected to the honour of the Emperors <hi>Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus,</hi> upon occaſion of ſome victory they had gained over the northern <hi>Britons</hi> by <hi>Calpurnius Agricola</hi> their <hi>Legate,</hi> in which this <hi>Felix Senecio</hi> had the command of the firſt wing of the <hi>Aſti.</hi> The <hi>Aſti,</hi> according to <hi>Pancirollus,</hi> were the inhabitants of the <hi>Aſta,</hi> a colony in <hi>Ligu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is very uſeful and curious, though it contains only the name of the <hi>Legio ſecunda Auguſta,</hi> and the number of the <hi>Cohort,</hi> namely, the <hi>tenth,</hi> for this farther confirms what I had from other reaſons and inſcriptions conjectured before, that this Legion was employed on the eaſt end of the wall, and this Cohort of that Legion in particular: the <hi>Sea Goat</hi> and <hi>Pegaſus</hi> at the top are not uncommon, and ſeem to denote the maritime ſituation of the country on the one hand, and the ſwiftneſs of the Roman victory on the other.

                     <p>This ſtation on <hi>Benwell Hill</hi> has furniſhed a good many inſcriptions; but I remember not to have ſeen or heard of any <hi>Roman coins</hi> found here, nor can I ſay in the general that Roman coins are ſo frequent in the ſtations on the wall as in ſome other places; but <hi>the fine urn</hi> which they now preſerve in <hi>the Library at Durham</hi> was found at this place. The cut of the letters in the inſcriptions belonging to <hi>Benwell</hi> is tolerably good, and the inſcriptions themſelves are not ſo much perplexed with ligatures of letters, as thoſe of later dates often are, though theſe are not wholly free from them. But the moſt curious inſcriptions have been removed out of this county: many were carried off by <hi>Sir Robert Cotton,</hi> ſeveral of which are yet remaining at <hi>Connington</hi> near <hi>Stilton</hi> in <hi>Hantingdonſhire;</hi> but they alſo are going to ruin, for the ſummer-houſe where they were carefully placed by <hi>Sir Robert</hi> being now uncovered, and in a ruinous ſtate, the ſtones and inſcriptions have already ſuffered very much.</p>

                        <hi>Mr Warburton</hi> had made the largeſt collection, who was at a great deal of pains and expence to collect the moſt curious Roman ſtones he could find in this county, but he unhappily broke many of them in order to make them more portable, and ſo carried off only that part of the ſtone which had the inſcription; by this means it has happened that many of the ſtones col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by him are only faces of altars, and in ſeveral inſtances the inſcriptions themſelves have ſuffered damage by this unhappy frugality.

and Mr Warburton, are to the following effect. No appearance of either of the Roman walls can be expected as far as the buildings of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> extend; but as ſoon as they are well ended, ſome feint veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiges

of both, or of what has belonged to them, begin to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for juſt at the end of <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> on the ſouth ſide of the highway, Hadrian's Ditch ſeems pretty viſible; and near the <hi>Quarry Houſe</hi> ſome
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0085300202:451"/>
feint marks of the Ditch and north Agger begin to appear, but chiefly of the latter; and this ſtate of the Vallum extends to <hi>Benwell Fort.</hi> As to Severus's Wall, little or nothing relating to it can be diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the town and the Quarry Houſe: ſome viſible remains of a caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellum are diſcoverable juſt behind the Quarry Houſe, and the line of the wall appeared to go through the midſt of the houſe. The caſtellum is conveniently placed for proſpect, and is the only one that is viſible between <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and the next ſtation: by the diſtance there ſhould have been another, but it is quite demoliſhed. From the <hi>Quarry Houſe</hi> to <hi>Elſwick</hi> Windmill, Severus's wall is difficult to trace; but from thence to the fort on <hi>Benwell Hill,</hi> the appearance of the ditch is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently very diſtinct, and the track of wall (which keeps much upon the high road) pretty certain.</p>
               <p>From the ſtation at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> (which is placed by theſe Antiquaries near the caſtle) to <hi>Benwell Hill,</hi> is near two miles and a furlong, and no inſcriptions have been diſcovered in this ſpace; at leaſt none now remain, nor even the remembrance of any.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of the ſtation on <hi>Benwell Hill</hi> is high, and the proſpect conſiderable: the ramparts are large and diſtinct, but the ditch ſcarce to be diſcerned. Hadrian's vallum ſeems to have fallen in with the ſouth ſide of it, and Severus's wall ſtrikes upon the eaſt and weſt ſides, ſo as to leave three chains to the north and ſix to the ſouth; but there is no appearance of the wall and its ditch being continued through the fort, though <hi>Mr Gordon</hi> has ſo repreſented it. There are ſtones in the road that now croſſes this fort, but theſe ſeem only to have been taken
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:0085300202:453"/>
out of the ruins to repair the highway. This ſtation falls in courſe to be <hi>Condercum,</hi> the name given in the <hi>Notitia</hi> to be the third in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where the <hi>Ala Prima Aſtorum</hi> was quartered.</p>
               <p>From the ſtation at <hi>Benwell Hill,</hi> Severus's wall and ditch, in going down to <hi>Denton,</hi> continue much in the ſame ſtate as before; but Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian's work on this ſide begins to appear more conſpicuous; both the walls paſs to the north of the hill and village of <hi>Benwell;</hi> from <hi>Denton</hi> to the <hi>Chapel Houſes,</hi> both the walls and their ditches are almoſt all the way viſible and diſtinct: over-againſt <hi>Weſt Denton Hall</hi> there ſeemed to be the viſible remains of a caſtellum, and ſomewhat like the ruins of a Turret not very far from it.</p>
               <p>Near the <hi>Chapel Houſes,</hi> about a furlong ſouth from Severus's wall, and leſs from Hadrian's, are ſomewhat like the ruins of a rampart: it is called <hi>the Caſtle Steads,</hi> the name uſually given to thoſe caſtella that are regularly placed along Severus's wall; but this (beſides its being at ſome diſtance from the wall, which the others never are) appears to have been of a quite different form and dimenſions; for it is about four chains long, with an interval in the middle, that looks like a gate, and ſo makes it appear very like the ſouth rampart of a ſmall fort: but if there have been ramparts on the other ſides, no traces of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at preſent. The proſpect here, eſpecially to the ſouth, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; perhaps it has been an exploratory tower belonging to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian's work, and prior to Severus's, and ſo neglected in his time. The uſual caſtellum belonging to Severus's wall, is about a furlong weſt from the <hi>Chapel Houſes,</hi> and viſible there; ſo that the other can neither be one of theſe, nor intended to ſupply the place of one. From the name <hi>Chapel Houſes,</hi> one would expect to find ſome ruinous <hi>chapel</hi> there; and I ſhould have ſuſpected ſomewhat of theſe ruins to have been of that nature, if the name <hi>Caſtle Steads</hi> had not determined againſt it.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Chapel Houſes</hi> to <hi>Wallbottle</hi> both walls and ditches are pretty viſible, and continue ſo to <hi>Newburn Dean:</hi> but on the deſcent from the <hi>Chapel Houſes</hi> to <hi>Wallbottle,</hi> Hadrian's north Agger becomes very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and holds ſo for the moſt part to <hi>Newburn Dean.</hi> Between <hi>Wallbottle</hi> and this <hi>Dean</hi> is a caſtellum ſtill very viſible; and from the Dean to <hi>Throcklow,</hi> Hadrian's vallum and ditch are diſcernible, but not very large, and Severus's wall not quite ſo plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:0085300202:454"/>Over-againſt <hi>Throcklow,</hi> in a convenient high place, there ſeems to be the ruins of another caſtellum; but near the village the vallum is very obſcure. From <hi>Throcklow</hi> to <hi>Heddon on the Wall,</hi> Severus's wall and ditch are very conſpicuous, and Hadrian's vallum and ditch near as viſible. The north Agger is alſo diſcernible for part of the way, and near <hi>Heddon</hi> it is very conſiderable. Before we come to <hi>Heddon,</hi> there is on the north ſide of the wall, another place of the ſame nature with that at <hi>Chapel Houſes,</hi> and called likewiſe <hi>Caſtle Steads.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains are very confuſed, and as it is altogether on the north of the wall, and detached a little from it, it ſeems to be a caſtellum erected prior to the wall, and neglected after the building of it. The proſpect from this place is very good, which makes it the more likely to have been of the exploratory kind. However there ſeems to have been an uſual caſtellum in Severus's wall, very near to theſe ruins; which is a further proof, that the other has not been uſed after the wall was erected. It ſeems to have been twice as large as one of Severus's caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella, and yet not large enough for a ſtation. Three ſides, the north, eaſt, and weſt, may be traced out, but the other is entirely levelled.</p>

               <p>In Nov. 1752, the workmen employed in making the military road which leads from Carliſle, found a great number of curious Roman coins and medals in the ruins of the Roman wall here.

               <p>Near <hi>Heddon on the Wall</hi> ſomewhat appears like Severus's military way, pretty near to his wall; but it is rather probable this appearance is nothing but the ſtones and ruins of the wall, and that the military ways have here coincided, becauſe the north Agger is ſo large, though in a ploughed field: not far from this place there have been ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Tumuli.</hi> The village <hi>Heddon Lawes,</hi> which ſtands upon a

The whole hill is like the ruins of a quarry, but curious and worth the ſeeing.

                        <q>On the twenty ſeventh of Aug. (1640) in the forenoon, his Majeſty received intelligence from the Lord Conway, that the Scots would that night be near Newcaſtle with their army, craving his Majeſty's pleaſure and directions about the diſpoſing of his army to the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the march of the Scots.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The King immediately called the Gentry of Yorkſhire, then at York, together, to wait upon his Majeſty, to whom the Earl of Strafford made a ſpeech, preſently after he prepared a pacquet to be ſent poſt to the Lord Conway, then underſtanding the Scots were come near Newcaſtle; and the author of theſe Collections being newly come poſt from London to York, and hearing a pacquet was about to be ſent to Newcaſtle, took the opportunity to bear the meſſenger company therewith: but when the author and the meſſenger with the pacquet came to Newcaſtle upon the 28th of Auguſt in the morning, they were informed, that the Lord Conway was gone to the army near Newburn, whither we went immediately, and found the Lord Conway and the Field Officers at a Council of War at Stella, half a mile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from the army, and delivered the Lord Conway the pacquet, which being opened, it contained ſpecial orders to prepare the army for an engagement with the Scots. Whilſt 
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:0085300202:457"/>they were in debate in this matter an Herald came in all haſte from the army, to acquaint the Lord Conway and Council of War, that the army was already engaged with the Scots; which ſeemed ſtrange to them, becauſe orders were given not to fight but upon the defence.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the 27th of Auguſt, <q>The Scots pitched their tents on Heddon Law, above Newborne, from whence there went a continued deſcent to the river of Tyne. In the night time they made great fires in and round about their camp, on an open mooriſh ground, (having coals plenty thereabouts) ſo that the camp ſeemed to be of large compaſs and extent.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That night and the next morning they ſuffered any Engliſhman to come into their camp, and made them welcome, with expreſſions of great love and proteſtations of doing harm to none but thoſe who ſhould oppoſe them in demanding juſtice of the King againſt incendiaries.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The ſame night part of the King's army, conſiſting of 3000 foot and 1500 horſe, were drawn forth into a plain meadow ground, which was near a mile in length, cloſe on the ſouth ſide of Tyne, called Newborne Haugh or Stella Haugh, to hinder the Scots from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the river in the night time, where were two ſeveral ſconces or breaſt-works, raiſed by the Engliſh againſt the two fords, which the Scots might paſs over at low water, for 'till then they could not paſs the Tyne, and into each ſconce were put four hundred muſqueteers and four pieces of ordinance.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Scots all the forenoon watered their horſes at one ſide of the river, and the Engliſh on the other ſide, without affronting one another, or giving any reproachful language.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Scots having the advantage of the riſing ground above Newborne, eaſily diſcerned the poſture and motion of the Engliſh army below in the valley, on the ſouth ſide the river; but the poſture of the Scots army the Engliſh could not diſcern by reaſon of the houſes, hedges, and incloſures in and about Newborne. The Scots brought down cannon into Newborne town, and planted ſome in the church ſteeple, a ſmall diſtance from the river Tyne: their muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers were placed in the church, houſes, lanes, and hedges, in and about Newborne.</q>

                        <q>The ſkirmiſh began thus, (as the author of theſe Collections was informed, being then upon the place) a Scottiſh officer, well mounted, having a black feather in his hat, came out of one of the thatcht houſes in Newborne, and watered his horſe in the river Tyne, as they had done all that day; an Engliſh ſoldier perceived he fixed his eye towards the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh trenches on the ſouth ſide of the river, fired at him, (whether in earneſt or to fright him is not known) but wounded the Scotchman with the ſhot, who fell off his horſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Scottiſh muſqueteers immediately fired upon the Engliſh, and ſo the fight begun with ſmall ſhot, but was continued with great ſhot as well as ſmall.</q>

                        <q>The Scots played with their cannon upon the Engliſh breaſt-works and ſconce; the King's army played with their cannon to beat the Scots out of the church ſteeple; thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued firing on both ſides, 'till it grew to be near low water, and by that time the Scots, with their cannon, had made a breach in the greater ſconce, which Colonel Lunsford com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, wherein many of his men were killed and began to retire, yet the Colonel prevailed with them to ſtand to their arms; but preſently after a Captain, a Lieutenant, and ſome other officers were ſlain in that work: then the ſoldiers took occaſion to complain, that they were put upon double duty, and had ſtood there all night and that day to that time, and that no ſoldiers were ſent from the army at Newcaſtle to relieve them; but Col. Lunsford again prevailed with them not to deſert their works, but another cannon ſhot hitting in the works amongſt the ſouldiers, and killing ſome more of them, they threw down their arms, and would abide in the fort no longer.</q>

                        <q>The enemy on the riſing ground above Newbourne, plainly diſcerned the poſture of the King's army, and how the ſouldiers had quit the great work, and being low water, the Scots commanded a forlorn party of 26 horſe, being gentlemen of the College of Juſtice Troop, to paſs the river, which they did with ſome ſwiftneſs; their orders were only to make diſcovery in what poſture the ſouldiers were about the uppermoſt work, but not to come to cloſe engagement, but fire at a diſtance and retreat.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Scots playing at this time very hard upon the furthermoſt trench, forced the Engliſh <q>foot to retreat from that work alſo, which the Scots diſcerning on the riſing ground at Newborne, commanded by Sir Thomas Hope, and two regiments of foot commanded by the Lord Craford, Lindſey, and Lord Lowdon, waded through the river, and General Leſley at this inſtant of time played hard with nine pieces of cannon, from a new ſconce which they had raiſed on a hill to the eaſt, and ſo galled the King's horſe, drawn up in plain meadow ground, that it much diſordered them, and ſending more forces over the river, a retreat was ſounded, and Colonel Lunsford drew off the cannon. Immediately Commiſſary Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot, ſon to the Lord Wilmot, Sir John Digby, a Romiſh Recuſant, and Daniel O'Neal, an Iriſhman, jointly engaged the enemy, and had a ſharp encounter with their horſe, they being commanded to bring up the rear, whilſt the foot retreated up Ryton and Stella Banks; but the Scots, with their freſh ſupply newly come over the river, environed theſe three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and took them and ſome others of their troops priſoners. General Leſley treated theſe commanders nobly in the Scots camp, and afterwards gave them their liberty freely to return to the King's army.</q>

               <p>By a geographical table lately publiſhed, it appears that the area of Northumberland contains 131,000 acres, and is 155 miles in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; having 3 boroughs, 13 market towns, 460 pariſhes, 22,741 dwelling-houſes, 113,705 inhabitants; ſends 8 Members to Parliament, and pays in proportion to the land-tax 5. It is divided into 7 wards; has 4 chief rivers, Tyne, Tweed, Alne, and Coquet; is within the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe of Durham, and gives a Ducal title. Newcaſtles lies in lat. 55:0, whoſe diſtance and bearing from London in meaſured miles is 278½ N. W.</p>
               <p>The revenues of the church in this county, excluſive of Newcaſtle and Hexhamſhire, exceed 11,000l. a year.</p>

            <p>MANY ancient Cuſtoms prevail in this County, the familiarity or outward inſignificance of which occaſion them to paſs without much attention: but as they are the ſtrongeſt traditional memorials of antiquity, I thought them worth collecting, and preſent them to the Reader with ſome ſhort Conjectures on their origin, and the hiſtorical facts to which they have relation.</p>
            <p>Mr Bryant's words are, <q>We talk indeed of ancient times, and times of Antiquity; but that time is moſt aged which has endured longeſt, and theſe are the moſt ancient days in which we are ourſelves converſant. We enjoy now an age of accumulated experience, and we are to make uſe of the helps which have been tranſmitted, to diſpel the miſt which has preceded.</q> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have afforded the accumulation; before their uſe, the diſſolution of every ſtate was the diſſipation of its ſcience and wiſdom: arts and collective know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were deſtroyed with the empire in which they flouriſhed, and only a few ſcattered fragments and diſtracted ruins remained to ſave them from total oblivion. By letters we poſſeſs the wiſdom of all quarters of the earth; times which have preceded their uſe left us chiefly traditional fragments, ſcattered abroad in national cuſtoms, and provincial names and phraſes.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of this Collection I ſhall remark whatever Mr Bourne, in his "Popular Antiquities," has noticed, with ſome of the illucidations and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſtructions given by his late Editor, the Rev. Mr John Brand.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>BABBA.</head>
               <p>The common and moſt tender appellation of an infant is <hi>Babba.</hi> This name Mr Bryant, in his Analyſis of ancient Mythology, ſays, is derived from the exclamation made by the congregation during the ceremony of purification, by paſſing infants through the fire of Molock. Fire worſhip was uſed in this country, and in the Druidical rites ſuch ceremony might be retained; for they held many cuſtoms ſo ſimilar to thoſe of the Hebrews, that it ſtrengthens the idea greatly they were communicated by the Phoenecians, or introduced from Germany, where the Amonians moſt certainly were well known. The Saxons alſo introduced their cuſtoms; they were worſhippers of fire, and might hold ſuch office of purification.</p>

The egg was a ſacred emblem, and ſeems a gift well adapted to infancy. Mr Bryant ſays, <q>An egg, containing in it the elements of life, was thought no improper emblem of the ark, in which were preſerved the rudiments of the future world: hence in the Dionuſiaca, and in other myſteries, one part of the nocturnal ceremony conſiſted in the conſecration of an egg. By this, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Porphyry, was ſignified the world. It ſeems to have been a favourite ſymbol, and very ancient, and we find it adopted among many nations. It was ſaid by the Perſians of Oromaſdes, that he formed mankind and incloſed them in an egg.</q> Cakes and Salt were uſed in religious rites by the ancients: The Jews probably adopted their appropriation from the Egyptians; <q>And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it ſhall be unleavened cakes of fine flour, &amp;c. <bibl>Lev. ii. 4.</bibl>
                  </q> 
                  <q>With all thine offerings thou ſhalt offer ſalt. <bibl>Ibid. 13.</bibl>
                  </q> There was a cuſtom in the Romiſh church of making a cake in honour of the Holy Virgin's time of child-birth, which was condemned by a canon in the Council of Trullus.<note n="*" place="bottom">Bou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <head>DOUBLING the THUMB.</head>
               <p>Children, to avoid approaching danger, are taught to double the thumb within the hand. This was much practiſed whilſt the terrors of witchcraft remained; and even in the beginning of the preſent century, much of thoſe unhappy prejudices poſſeſſed the minds of the vulgar. It was a cuſtom to fold the thumbs of dead perſons within the hand, to prevent the power of evil ſpirits over the deceaſed; the thumb in that poſition forming the ſimilitude of the character in the Hebrew Alphabet, which is commonly uſed to denote the name of God.</p>

               <head>NEW YEAR's DAY.</head>
               <p>The celebration of New Year's Day is preſerved in this country as a rural feſtival. Gifts are made to children, ſervants, and dependants, called New Year's Gifts. Mr Bourne quotes what Stillingfleet ſays, <q>That among the Saxons of the northern nations, the feaſt of the New Year was obſerved with more than ordinary jollity;</q> and, from Hoſpinian, ſays, <q>It was an ancient cuſtom of the Heathens, and afterwards practiſed by the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</q> Servants were exempt from their labour, and partook of the feaſt and rural ſports with their maſters: they were preſented with tokens of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and favour. On certain feſtivals, the Romans gave pieces of money to travellers and ſtrangers who were preſent at the ſacrifice. On our day of feſtivity, mirth is excited by a ruſtic maſquerading and playing tricks in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe: the hide of the ox ſlain for the winter cheer, is often put on, and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0085300202:496"/>
perſon thus attired, attempts to ſhew the character of the devil, by every hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible device in his power. All the winter ſports ſeem to expreſs a ſtrong opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ancients, that Genii of very contrary natures prevailed on earth, that the one was conſtantly concomitant to light as the other was to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and this image of the devil, which is frequently permitted to expel the inhabitants and take poſſeſſion of the houſe, is typical of the power of the evil genius, in the ſeaſon when the ſun is longeſt abſent from our hemiſphere. This correſponds with the lamentation uſed by thoſe who held the Eluſinian myſteries, and mourned for Adonis. It is very difficult to make any probable determination to what people we owe theſe cuſtoms. In the Roman Saturnalia and Sigillaria, this kind of frolicking was practiſed. Among the obſervations made by Mr Brand on Bourne's XIV Chap. he remarks, that there was an ancient cuſtom for young women to go about with a waffail bowl, that is, "a bowl of ſpiced ale," on New Year's Eve, with ſome ſort of verſes that were ſung by them in going from door to door. Waffail is derived from the Anglo Sax. <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>TWELFTH DAY.</head>
               <p>The twelfth day after the day of our Saviour's birth is attended with great feſtivity. There are diverſions uſed in the ſouthern parts of England, which have not reached this northern county. The mirth of the day here conſiſts of feaſting and a ſocial intercourſe between neighbouring families. Mr Brand makes a happy quotation from Collier's Eccl. Hiſt. vol. I. p. 163, in his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on Bourne's Chap. XVII. <q>In the days of King Aelfrid a law was made with relation to the holydays, by virtue of which the 12 days after the nativity of our Saviour were made feſtivals.</q> So much as theſe feaſts have been decried, I cannot ſee them in the deſpicable light many modern authors have been pleaſed to place them. They were the occaſion of gathering neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours together, in good humour with each other, and the means of keeping them on terms of intimacy: friendſhip and benevolence were thereby increaſed, and good offices multiplied: public matters at ſuch times were diſcuſſed and amicably determined; and thoſe happy effects reſulted which tended not only to the advantage of the individual, but to the good of ſociety at large. This age is refined into inſipidity: few of the old hoſpitable days return: ſociability is ſickened into unmeaning ceremony. In ancient times the bard was brought to the feſtive hall, to rehearſe the Excellencies of our anceſtors, to fire the breaſt with emulation, to inſpire noble and bounteous ſentiments, and lift us, through example, into an adoption of the character of thoſe heroes and men of honour from whom we were deſcended: then it was the genial ſpirit was rouſed, and benevolence prevailed. The name of friendſhip is retained in our language, and the real character is ſomewhere ſtill found to exiſt; but it is chiefly in middle life; the great and opulent in general have little experience of it: each apparently ſeparates himſelf from community, and is involved in his own circle. The diſtinguiſhing characteriſticks, which in former days pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a man fortune and fame, are become intrinſic trifles, with which he

What would be the conſequence, ſhould adverſe ages ever bring on exigences of ſtate?

The celebrated fable points out the politics which would prevail with the loweſt claſſes of men, <q>If we are only to be regarded for ſervility, it is indifferent to us to whom we are ſervants.</q> There is nothing keeps this part of the ſtate within rule, but the fear of ſtill worſning the condition.</p>

               <p>It is little noted in this county, but by name. Several religious rites were made peculiar to it in the Romiſh church. In the quotation of St Gregory's Letter, in the notes to p. 27 in the ſecond volume of the work, a reaſon is given for not aboliſhing the Pagan ceremonies, in countries where converſion was taking place; but it was commanded to adapt them to chriſtian ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and this ſeems to carry with it a ſtrong reaſon for the ſimilarity there was in many of the ceremonies of the chriſtian church in the firſt ages and the Pagan rites.

Bacon's Reliques of Rome, fo. 164, makes a quotation which informs us, that the Romans, in the ſervice of their God Mars, and his mother Februa, made proceſſions in the city of Rome with lighted torches; the remains of which cuſtom ſtill exiſting with the vulgar in the time of Pope Sergius: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that it ſhould be converted into an holy office of the chriſtian church, and that the congregation on the ſame day made their approach to the high altar with lighted tapers, in honour of the Holy Virgin.

               <p>is an anniverſary day of divination by lots. It is a common ſaying, that birds on this day chooſe their mates. It may have relation to ſome domeſtic birds, and alſo rooks and pigeons. The cuſtom now is, that the names of young people are wrote on ſcrols of paper, and each draws one, confident that marriages are made in heaven, and in full hope the lot of life will be pointed out. What particular attention the allotted ſwain in former days was obliged to pay the fair one, to whoſe hands his name had fallen, I have not diſcovered. Mr Brand, in his obſervations on Bourne's XXth chap. quotes a paſſage in Moreſin to this purpoſe: <q>That at this feſtival, the men uſed to make the women preſents, as upon another occaſion the women uſed to do to the men; but that in Scotland on this day preſents were reciprocal.</q> Mr Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpeaks of this cuſtom in Scotland, by which young people try prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of their future fortunes in the nuptial ſtate. The firſt inventor of this cuſtom muſt have been ſome benevolent female, who ſtudied to encourage the intercourſe of the ſexes; for by ſuch means intimacies might ariſe, productive of love and marriage engagements: or otherwiſe the firſt deſign of thoſe lots was, that thoſe who ſhared in the dances and diverſions, might have their proper partners aſſigned, without hazarding the confuſion and diſpleaſure which muſt neceſſarily ariſe in the liberty of choice.</p>
               <p>There was a religious ſect of Valentinians, but I find no ceremony uſed by them or tenet they embraced, which could have any relation to theſe cuſtoms.</p>

               <head>SHROVE TIDE.</head>
               <p>It is particularly obſerved. Shrove is derived from <hi>Shrive,</hi> confeſſion; a preparation enjoined in the Romiſh church, previous to the duties of Lent. It was particularly preſcribed, that all offences ſhould be mutually forgiven, and reconciliation take place, before they entered upon the ſolemnities of Lent; and this was conſequently a day of mutual intercourſe and amity. In ſeveral ancient Roman Catholic families, the kitchen is opened, and every neighbour and paſſenger is permitted to enter and fry a pancake, for which the neceſſary proviſion is made ready. This ſeems to be derived from a cuſtom in the refectory of religious houſes, where the table was ſpread on this day for all pilgrims, travellers, and viſitants. In Newcaſtle, Durham, and other places, the great bell of the church is tolled, the ſervants have holyday, and whoever partakes of the pancakes of the day muſt fry them; a circumſtance which occaſions high kitchen mirth. In the keeping of the vigils of all ſolemn days, the ceremony began at noon. The ringing of the great bell at noon was a ſignal to clear the larder of fleſh meat, from which time its uſe was prohibited. In Mr Brand's Appendix to Bourne's Pop. Antiq. he ſays, <q>A kind of pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake feaſt preceding Lent was uſed in the Greek church, from whence probably we have borrowed it.</q> One of the chief diverſions of the day is fighting of cocks. Moreſin ſays this was derived from the Athenians, who exhibited cock fightings on one day in each year, an inſtitution of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtockley; and that thoſe of the Romiſh church derived the cuſtom on this day from thence. The inference is ridiculous. It was a general holyday, and this was one of the vulgar diſſipations, no otherwiſe peculiar to the ſeaſon, than that the animal was in good feather at this time of the year, and in condition for the greateſt exertion of powers.</p>

               <p>The ſecond Sunday preceding Eaſter is called Carling Sunday. The peculiar cuſtom is the ſerving up parched peas to the table. This ſeems to be derived
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0085300202:500"/>
from the ſeverities of the Romiſh church in the early ages, at this period in Lent, in their abſtinence and mortification uſing ſuch food. This was called Paſſion Sunday; and Mr Brand quotes Marſhall on the Saxon Goſpels, vol. I. p. 536, where it is ſaid, Care or Carr Sunday was not unknown to the Engliſh in his time. Mr Brand adds, It was uſual to give away beans in the dole at funerals, both with the Heathen and the people of the Romiſh church. They are uſed as a kind of mourning dole on this day. Eraſmus mentions an obſervation of Pliny's, concerning Pythagoras's Interdiction of the uſe of Beans, "that they contain the ſouls of the dead." Thence they were uſed in the Parentalia. Plutarch held, that pulſe was of the higheſt efficacy for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the manes.

In this country the buds of the ſaugh, which is one of the earlieſt marks of vegetation the trees of the climate ſhew, are gathered and adopted for branches of palm. Mr Bourne ſays, the branch of palm was uſed in the country near Jeruſalem as an emblem of victory. Our adoption of the ſaugh buds may ariſe from their being the firſt bloom the woods wear after winter is ſubdued, and might be uſed alſo typically, from their bearing teſtimony of renovation, as a ſacred emblem of victory over death.</p>

This has been an innocent artifice to draw forth the vulgar to early devotion; and what could be more powerfully typical and figurative to ignorant minds that conceive few images of the reſurrection of our Lord, than that of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and reſplendent ſun, riſing from a gilded horizon, diſpelling every gloom and ſhade, and diſpenſing light, beauty, and joy over the face of the earth. It was a ſeaſon and a ſpectacle, under the immediate impreſſions of which, well adapted and pathetic exhortations would take a deep root. The Druids and Saxons both had made it a chief object of worſhip, and the time of ſun riſing the chief ſeaſon for their religious rites and adorations; of theſe, ſtrong prejudices would remain with the vulgar. Bourne ſays, the ſalutation of the eaſtern church on this day was, "The Lord is riſen," and the uſual anſwer was, "The Lord is riſen indeed;" and no doubt they were peculiar to the morning.</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0085300202:501"/>The children have dyed and gilded eggs given them, which are called <hi>Paſte Eggs,</hi> a ſuppoſed corruption of <hi>Paſche Eggs.</hi> Eggs were held by the Egyptians as a ſacred emblem of the renovation of mankind after the deluge. The Jews adopted it to ſuit the circumſtances of their hiſtory, as a type of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the land of Egypt; and it was uſed in the Feaſt of the Paſſover as part of the furniture of the table with the paſchal lamb. The Chriſtians have certainly uſed it on this day, as retaining the elements of future life, for an emblem of the reſurrection. Mr Brand has many well choſen quotations on this ſubject, among which is a prayer extracted from the ritual of Pope Paul the Vth, made for the uſe of England, Ireland, and Scotland.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Bleſs, O Lord, we beſeech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a wholeſome ſuſtenance to thy faithful ſervants, eating it in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to thee, <hi>on account of the reſurrection</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who with thee,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He quotes from Dr Chandler's Travels in Aſia Minor a paſſage, in which it appears, thoſe of the Greek church on this day preſented coloured eggs. In Ruſſia there is the like cuſtom, which he ſhews in two quotations, one from the Abbè d' Auteroche, in his Journey to Siberia, and the other from Hakluyt's Voyage 1589. But from all the quotations no determination is drawn why the <hi>painted Eggs</hi> were uſed on this day peculiarly, and eſpecially being no part of the day's repaſt. The field of conjecture is open and at large to every one. It ſeems as if the Egg was thus decorated for a religious trophy after the days of mortification and abſtinence were over, and feſtivity had taken place; and as an emblem of the renovation of life, certified to us by the reſurrection from the regions of death and the grave.</p>
               <p>Mr Brand, p. 252, gives us the following note: <q>
                     <hi>Eraſmus ſpeaking of the proverb,</hi> Mea eſt Pila, <hi>that is,</hi> I have got the ball, <hi>tells us that it ſignifies</hi> I have obtained the victory, I am maſter of my wiſhes.</q> The Romaniſts certainly erected a ſtandard on Eaſter Day in token of our Lord's victory; but it would perhaps be indulging fancy too far to ſuppoſe that the Biſhops and Governors of churches, who uſed to condeſcend to play at <hi>hand ball</hi> at this time, did it in a myſtical way, and with reference to the triumphal joy of the ſeaſon. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, however, that many of their cuſtoms and ſuperſtitions are founded on ſtill more trivial circumſtances than even this imaginary analogy.</p>
               <p>It was an ancient cuſtom for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, accompanied with great numbers of the Burgeſſes to go every year at the feaſts of Eaſter and Whitſuntide to the Forth, the little mall of the town, with the maces, ſword, and cap of maintenance carried before them. The young people of the town ſtill aſſemble there, at this ſeaſon particularly, play at hand ball, dance, &amp;c. but are no longer countenanced in their innocent feſtivity by the preſence of their Governors, who no doubt in ancient times
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0085300202:502"/>
uſed to unbend the brow of authority, and partake with their happy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented people, the puerile pleaſures of the feſtive ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>It was alſo uſual among the ſports of the day to have foot courſes, &amp;c. the prize being a <hi>tanſey cake.</hi> It has been alledged, that the uſe of <hi>tanſey</hi> was adopted from the Jewiſh meſs of bitter herbs at this ſeaſon. A diſcuſſion of this practice of the Jews would be too tedious in this place, and articles of mortification ſeem not to correſpond with the univerſal feſtivity of the time; I rather conceive that the prizes were the ancient ſweet bread, concerning the uſe of which I ſhall have occaſion to make ſome remarks in the ſequel, and that <hi>tanſey</hi> was uſed for its flavour and ſalubrity only.</p>
               <p>Mr Brand quotes Durand Lib. 6. c. 86. 9. for a very ſingular and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cuſtom, <q>That on Eaſter Day wives uſed to beat their huſbands, and on the day following huſbands their wives:" and he adds, "There is a cuſtom ſtill retained at the city of Durham on theſe holydays, on one day the men take off the women's ſhoes, which are only to be redeemed by a preſent, and on another day the women take off the men's in like manner.</q> This cuſtom is not a peculiarity of the city of Durham only, but extends into other parts of that county, as well as Northumberland. As it ſeems to be the remains of ſome religious ceremony, if peculiar to the cathedral it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably travel with the See from Lindisfarn by Cheſter to Durham, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains would be found ſcattered through this paſſage. In Lancaſhire the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the day is to lift the paſſenger from the ground: this ſhews of itſelf of what it is emblematical. But our cuſtom leaves us wide and indeterminate conjectures. In the cathedral of Durham there was a cuſtom on Good Friday for the Monks to approach the high altar, then decorated with all the ſolemn emblems of that tremendous day, on their knees, being bare footed. On Eaſter Day they made a ſolemn proceſſion, when all the ſpectators pulled off their ſhoes, as treading on holy ground. King Canute approached the ſhrine of St. Cuthbert from Garmondſway, the diſtance of five miles, with all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and attendants bare-footed; when he gave great territories and donations to that church. Lel. Col. vol. I. p. 331. Theſe are the moſt memorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have been able to collect. Preparatory to the paſſover, our Saviour waſhed the feet of the Diſciples; after which he gave them this ordonance: "For I have given you an example, that you ſhould do as I have done to you." The Monks of Durham are ſaid to have waſhed the feet of the poor, within the cloiſter, in commemoration of our Saviour's act. In the ages immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the converſion of the Britons, an inveterate hatred and contempt was ſhewn to all Jews, who by ſhipwreck or other caſualty came among them; even to a greater bitterneſs the averſion was carried, than againſt the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Heathen. The order of the paſſover ceremonies, as ſet forth in the 12th chapter of Exodus, enjoins the Jews to have their ſhoes upon their feet: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in contradiſtinction, or in reproach of the Jews, the ſhoes of paſſengers are pulled off.</p>

               <p>I intimated in the preceding pages, an intention of remarking the <hi>Sweet Bread</hi> uſed in religious rites. Small loaves of bread, peculiar in their form, being long and ſharp at both ends, are called Buns. This name takes place where old religious ceremonies have been ſolemnized, derived from the conſecrated ſweet bread, which was offered on high feſtivals. It is of the higheſt antiquity; according to Mr Bryant, <q>the offerings which people in ancient times uſed to preſent to the Gods, were generally purchaſed at the entrance of the temple; eſpecially every ſpecies of conſecrated bread, which was denominated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. One ſpecies of ſacred bread which uſed to be offered to the Gods, was of great antiquity, and called <hi>Boun.</hi> The Greeks who changed the <hi>Nu</hi> final into a <hi>ſigma,</hi> expreſſed it in the nominative <gap reason="foreign">

The prophet Jeremiah takes notice of this kind of offering, when he is ſpeaking of the Jewiſh women at Pathros in Egypt, and of their baſe idolatry; in all which their huſbands had encouraged them; the women in their expoſtulation upon his rebuke tell him, <hi>Did we make her cakes to worſhip her?</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Hock-days Þucx-daeg Dies irriſorius, a time of ſcorning or triumphing: a feſtival of the common people held ſoon after Eaſter. The ſervants had liberty of divers ſports and diverſions, and in compenſation for the loſs of time in their ſervice, the maſters were intitled to a gratuity. It was held in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the day on which the Danes were maſſacred, A. D. 1002; and ſuch were the licentious enormities committed therein, the ſervants deeming themſelves, during this feſtival, under no law of ſubordination, that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the church in the fifteenth century, under pain of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The remains of this feſtival ſeem to be retained in our <hi>fools day,</hi> the 1ſt of April, when all ſorts of ridiculous tricks are practiced to render the perſon you meet with a ſcoff and jeſt: it may be preſumed the perſons who, from their connections and intercourſe with the Danes, lamented the horrid ſlaughter were thus ſcoffed and ridiculed; and thoſe who were ignorant of the event, ſent on fruitleſs errands to their dying friends, weltering in gore.

               <head>MAY-DAY.</head>
               <p>It ſtill retains ſome of its ancient ſports. The young people of both ſexes go out early in the morning of the 1ſt day of May, to gather the flowering thorns and the dew of the graſs, which they bring home with muſic and acclamations; and having dreſſed a poll on the town-green with garlands, dance around it. The dew was conſidered as a grand coſmetick, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the face from wrinkles, blotches, and the traces of old age: the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt gift Flora could beſtow on her votaries. It ſeems from theſe remains, that this feſtival was introduced by the Romans, who obſerved it in honour of Flora. What particular rites originally attended it with that people we ſhall not enquire: at preſent it is celebrated only with mirth, innocence, and love. The Druids, who were the prieſts of the God of nature, and celebrated every remarkable period in the change of ſeaſons, left a memorial of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious rites on this day, very different from thoſe inſtituted in honour of the notorious divinity Flora; that is, a Bel-tein rural ſacrifice. It is to be traced in the mountainous and uncultivated parts of Cumberland, among the Cheviots, and in many parts of Scotland. Mr Pennant gives a particular deſcription in his Tour in Scotland: <q>On the firſt of May, in the Highlands of Scotland, the herdſmen of every village hold their Beltein: they cut a ſquare trench in the ground, leaving the turf in the middle: on that they make a fire of wood, on which they dreſs a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal, and milk, and bring, beſides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whiſky; for each of the company muſt contribute ſomething. The rites begin with ſpilling ſome of the caudle on the ground, by way of liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0085300202:505"/>
on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raiſed nine ſquare knobs, each dedicated to ſome particular being, the ſuppoſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of their flocks and herds, or to ſome particular animal, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>al deſtroyer of them; each perſon then turns his face to the fire, breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his ſhoulder, ſays, this I give to thee, preſerve thou my horſes; this to thee, preſerve thou my ſheep, and ſo on. After that they uſe the ſame ceremony to the noxious animals: this I give to thee, O fox! ſpare thou my lambs: this to thee, O hooded crow! this to thee, eagle! when the ceremony is over, they dine on the caudle,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We retain ſomething of this kind in the ſyllabub, prepared for the May feaſt, which is made of warm milk from the cow, ſweet cake, and wine; and a kind of divination is practiſed, by fiſhing with a ladle for a wedding ring, which is dropt into it for the purpoſe of prognoſticating who ſhall be firſt married.</p>
               <p>Mr Brand, in his Obſervations on Bourne's XXV chap. makes ſeveral quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from a pamphlet, intitled, "The way to things by words, and to words by things." He ſays, <q>We gather from him that our anceſtors hold an anniverſary aſſembly on May-day; the <hi>Column of May</hi> (whence our May Pole) was the great ſtandard of juſtice in the <hi>Ey-commons</hi> or fields of May. Here it was that people, if they ſaw cauſe, depoſed or puniſhed their Governors, their Barons, their Kings. The garland or crown when hung on the top of the <hi>May</hi> or Pole, was the great ſignal for convening the people. This was one of the ancienteſt cuſtoms, which from the remoteſt ages, has been by repetition from year to year perpetuated.</q> 
                  <q>It was conſidered as the boundary day that divided the confines of winter and ſummer, alluſively to which, there was inſtituted a ſportful war between two parties; the one in defence of the continuance of winter, the other for bringing in the ſummer. The youth were divided into troops, the one in winter livery, the other in the gay habit of the ſpring. The mock battle was always fought booty, the ſpring was ſure to obtain the victory, which they celebrated by carrying triumphally green branches with May flowers, proclaiming and ſinging the ſong of joy, of which the burthen was in theſe or equivalent terms.</q>

               <p>The ceremonies of the eve and day of Midſummer were various, and worthy attention. In all theſe feſtivals, it was the cuſtom to keep the wake, as it was called, or watch, 'till after midnight, and to begin the ſports and ceremonies of the day in the firſt hour of the morning.</p>

                  </gap>tice was the grand feſtival and jubilee of the Druids, and all thoſe who retained any of the Amonian rites, of which we trace ſeveral in the religious ceremonies of the Saxons. This day was celebrated with peculiar magnificence and ſolemnity, when the adored luminary was at his greateſt altitude. It has been alledged by ſome, that the Eluſinian rites, in celebrating the return of Proſerpine, gave part of the ceremony of this day; and that the uſe of garlands is derived from the cuſtom of the initiated in the Eluſinian miſteries, being crowned with flowers.</p>
               <p>It is uſual to raiſe fires on the tops of high hills and in the villages, and ſport and dance around them; this is of very remote antiquity, and the firſt cauſe loſt in the diſtance of time. Many reaſons have been aſſigned in different periods. Bourne quotes a paſſage of Durand to the following purport, <q>In ancient times the dragons, being incited to luſt through the heat of the ſeaſon, did frequently as they flew through the air, ſpertmatize in the wells and fountains; by this means the water became infected, and the air pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, ſo that whoever drank the waters was either tormented with a grievous diſtemper, or loſt his life. As ſoon as the phyſicians perceived this, they ordered fires to be made every where about the wells and fountains, and thoſe things which occaſioned the noiſomeſt ſmell to be burnt, knowing that thereby the dragons would be driven away: and foraſmuch as this cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was obſerved about the time we now celebrate St John Baptiſt's feaſt, it is therefore ſtill obſerved among ſome people.</q> In this enigmatical and miſterious account we plainly trace, the fires were originally kindled for ſacred rites and ſacrifice, in order to avert the horrors of peſtilence, which in early ages frequently attended the advancing heat of ſummer, in a country covered with foreſts and ſwamps, whoſe reſpiration and exhalations brought on various diſtempers, of which Epilepſies was one of the moſt general; to prevent which, the darkneſs of thoſe times had received few diſcoveries of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. In Scotland they uſed to run about the mountains and higher grounds with lighted torches, like the Sicilian women of old in ſcarch of Proſerpine.— The propheteſſes in Mona, at the approach of the Romans, ran about with diſhevelled hair in a frantic mode with lighted torches, performing various rites to execrate the enemy. It was a cuſtom not many years ago in this county, for the villagers to run with burning firebrands round their fields, and then in a forcible manner taking the aſhes from ſome neighbouring fire, they uſed to exclaim, <hi>"We have won the flower (alias flour) of the wake."</hi> Moreſin conceives we trace the ancient <hi>Cerealia</hi> in this ceremony. It is not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0085300202:507"/>
to be wondered, that the Druid rites ſhould in courſe of time be mixed with the Roman. Mr Borlace, ſpeaking of this cuſtom in Wales, ſays, <q>He takes it to be the remains of the Druid ſuperſtition.</q> Moreſin is of opinion, the cuſtom of leaping over the fires is a veſtige of the ordeal, and thoſe perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe feats were ſhewing tokens of innocence and virtue, by being neither burnt or ſullied. The act of leaping through the flames was certainly a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious one, and was meant as a kind of purification, and not merely a ſport and diſplay of agility. Mr Pennant mentions another remarkable cuſtom in Scotland, of which he was an eye witneſs: they take the new baptized infant, and wave it three or four times gently over a flame, ſaying thrice, <hi>"Let the fire conſume thee now or never:"</hi> this ſeems to be the direct act of purification in paſſing the fire of Molock. Like other heatheniſh cuſtoms appropriated to feſtivals of the chriſtian church, theſe are adopted on the day of St John, or rather uſed on the ſame anniverſary, and the name of that Saint aſſumed to give them new ſanctity. Mr Brand quotes ſeveral paſſages from <hi>Gebelin's Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories Orientales:</hi> 
                  <q>Can one (ſays he) overlook here the St John fires, kindled about midnight, on the very moment of the ſolſtice, by the greateſt part both of ancient and modern nations? A religious ceremony, which goes backward thus to the moſt remote antiquity, and which was obſerved for the proſperity of States, and to diſpel every kind of evil.</q> Divinations were alſo uſed on the vigil of this day: <q>Men and women were accuſtomed to gather together in the evening by the ſea ſide, or in ſome certain houſes, and there adorn a girl, who was her parent's firſt begotten child, after the manner of a bride. Then they feaſted, and leaped after the manner of bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanals, and danced and ſhouted as they were wont to do on their holidays; after this they poured into a narrow necked veſſel, ſome of the ſea water, and put alſo into it certain things belonging to each of them; then, as if the devil gifted the girl with the faculty of telling future things, they would enquire with a loud voice, about the good or evil fortune that ſhould attend them; upon this the girl would take out of the veſſel the firſt thing that came to hand, and ſhew it and give it to the owner, who, upon receiving it, was ſo fooliſh as to imagine himſelf wiſer, as to the good or evil fortune that ſhould attend him.</q> Bourne, p. 226.</p>
               <p>Another cuſtom uſed on this day, is to dreſs out ſtools with a cuſhion of flowers. A lair of clay is placed on the ſtool, and therein is ſtuck, with great regularity, an arrangement of all kinds of flowers, ſo cloſe as to form a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cuſhion: theſe are exhibited at the doors of houſes in the villages, and at the ends of ſtreets and croſs lanes of larger towns, where the attendants beg money from paſſengers, to enable them to have an evening feaſt and dancing. This cuſtom is evidently derived from the <hi>Ludi Compitalii</hi> of the Romans: this appellation was taken from the <hi>Compita</hi> or croſs lanes, where they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and celebrated by the multitude aſſembled before the building of Rome. <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> revived this feſtival after it had been neglected for many years. It was the feaſt of the <hi>Lares</hi> or houſhold Gods, who preſided as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0085300202:508"/>
well over houſes as ſtreets. This mode of adorning the ſeat or couch of the <hi>Lares</hi> was beautiful, and the idea of repoſing them on aromatic flowers and beds of roſes was excellent. The chief port of the ceremonies and ſolemnities of this feaſt uſed by the Romans, as we are told by the Poets and Hiſtorians, was exhibiting the houſhold Gods, crowning and adorning them with chaplets and garlands of flowers, and offering ſacrifices up and down the ſtreets. The Britiſh remains of the ceremony are more refined—that of repoſing them on thoſe delicious beds. Suetonius tells us, that Auguſtus ordered the <hi>Lares</hi> to be crowned twice a year. We are not told there was any cuſtom among the Romans, of ſtrangers or paſſengers offering gifts. Our modern uſage of all theſe old cuſtoms terminates in ſeeking to gain money for a merry night.</p>

               <p>After harveſt the Heathens are ſaid to have ſacrificed to the Deity Vacina or Vacuna, who was ſuppoſed to preſide over Reſt and Eaſe. It is now a cuſtom on the laſt day of reaping, to dreſs up an image of the corn, and bear it home in triumph, which is called the Kern (properly Corn) Baby. In ſome places I have ſeen an image apparelled in great finery, crowned with flowers, a ſheaf of corn placed under her arm, and a ſcycle in her hand, carried out of the village on the morning of the concluſive reaping day, with muſic and much clamour of the reapers into the field, where it ſtands fixed on a poll all day, and when the reaping is done, is brought home in like manner: This they call the <hi>Harveſt Queen,</hi> and repreſents the Roman Ceres. The ſervants having performed the moſt valuable part of their labour, are entertained by their maſters, when all diſtinction is laid aſide. This feaſt is called the Mell-Supper, at which there are dancing, maſquing, and diſguiſing, and all other kinds of rural mirth. The name of this ſupper is derived from the rites of <hi>Ceres,</hi> when an offering of the firſt-fruits was made; the word <hi>Melle</hi> being a provincial word, and ſignifies in this country <hi>mingled;</hi> implying that the cakes uſed at this feſtival are mingled or made of new corn, and that it is the feaſt of the firſt mingling of flour of the new reaped wheat. The Romans held a ſolemn day after harveſt, dedicated to Ceres and Ops, the accuſtomed victim a boar: but we cannot from any part of the above rural feaſt gather the leaſt Roman remains, ſave only the ſeaſon and the image of the Goddeſs. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing after harveſt may have an origin as high in antiquity as reaping itſelf: The firſt inſtance we read of is in the 4th chapter of Geneſis, ver. 3, 4.</p>

               <p>On the eve of the Nativity, the peaſants place upon the fire a large piece of wood, called a Yule Clog; ſome have looked upon this as a rural ſacrifice, the beaſt being ſtalled, there is no further uſe for the tether clog, by which he was prevented ſtraying in the ſummer from his paſture. It has had a more diſtant implication, and intended to keep up the wake, and drive away malevolent ſpirits, and ſpirits of darkneſs. The Druids held a ſolemn feſtival at this time, and fires were lighted to fill up the ſpace between the laſt night and firſt morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the year, that the evil genius might not prevail. The Eluſinian myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were typical of the renewing year; and the howlings and lamentations made in the hours of darkneſs for the loſs of Adonis, were like our ſolemn wake over the yule clog, which was to baniſh the ſpirits of darkneſs whilſt the ſun was in his deepeſt receſs. In thoſe rites, the return of Adonis, or the ſun, was repreſented by the approach of a Prieſt with a lighted torch, thereby diſpelling the horrid darkneſs, in which the prevalency of the evil genius was deſcribed by horrid noiſes, and all the dreadful ſpectacles ingenuity could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, to ſecure the ſuperſtition of the aſſembly. Among all nations there has appeared a prevalent ſuperſtition touching good and evil ſpirits, one ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the hours of light, the others darkneſs; one the guides of man's recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and virtues, the other his malevolence and vice.</p>

Arthel is a Britiſh word, and is frequently more correctly written Arddelw. In Wales it is written Arddel, and ſignifies, according to Dr. Daviſe's Dictionary, <hi>Aſſerere,</hi> to avouch. This cuſtom ſeems of very diſtant antiquity, and was a ſolemn feſtival made at the time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly expoſing the corps, to exculpate the heir, and thoſe intitled to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the deceaſed, from fines and mulcts to the Lord of the Manor, and from all accuſation of having uſed violence; ſo that the perſons then convoked might avouch, that the perſon died fairly, and without ſuffering any perſonal injury. The Dead were thus exhibited by ancient nations, and perhaps the cuſtom was introduced here by the Romans.</p>
