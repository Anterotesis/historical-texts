            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>PROPOSALS FOR PUBLISHING BY SUBSCRIPTION, DEDICATED, WITH PERMISSION, TO THE MOST NOBLE THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY, <hi>A COMPLETE HISTORY</hi> OF THE ENGLISH STAGE. INTERSPERSED with a comparative and comprehenſive review of the ASIATIC, the GRECIAN, the ROMAN, the SPANISH, the ITALIAN, the PORTU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GESE, the GERMAN, the FRENCH, and OTHER THEATRES from their ORIGIN to the PRESENT TIME; and involving BIOGRAPHICAL TRACTS and ANECDOTES, inſtructive and amuſing, concerning a prodigious number of AUTHORS, COMPOSERS, PAINTERS, ACTORS, SINGERS, and PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRONS of DRAMATIC PRODUCTIONS IN ALL COUNTRIES; with an intention to place the STAGE IN GENERAL, and the ENGLISH STAGE IN PARTICULAR, in an eligible point of view, as an object of national conſequence, by conſidering it as a criterion of taſte and a regulator of human manners. The whole written, with the aſſiſtance of intereſting documents, collected in the courſe of Five and Thirty Years, by MR. DIBDIN.</p>
            <p>THIS work will be publiſhed on a fine wove paper, and with a beautiful new type by FRY, in THIRTY-FIVE Numbers, at ONE SHILLING each number, making, with the dedication and preface, which will be given as an addition to the laſt number, FIVE HANDSOME VOLUMES IN OCTAVO.</p>
            <p>TO be continued MONTHLY, from the FIRST of MAY, 1797, on which Day the FIRST NUMBER will be publiſhed.</p>

            <p>NEVER was there leſs difficulty in deſcribing the neceſſity, the advantage, and the utility of a work than of this. To faſcinate the mind into the exerciſe of morality, to ridicule folly into a love of ſocial duty, to inculcate virtue through the medium of pleaſure, and to beget an abhorrence of vice by rendering it hideous, was origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended by the inſtitution, and has, to the infinite benefit of the mind, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the ſenſes, and the improvement of the underſtanding, continued to be, but with little abatement, the province and operation of the ſtage.</p>
            <p>WITH the pulpit, and the bar, the ſtage has ever been properly claſſed; and it will readily be granted that if the regulation and care of our religious principles, and the protection and ſecurity of our worldly property, are objects of national im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, the poliſh and refinement of our ſocial manners cannot make up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable part of our character as rational beings; ſince, without the inoffenſive pleaſures of life, the more ſerious conſiderations of ſpiritual and temporal concerns could no more render the enjoyments of the mind complete, than, without health, could the comforts of piety, and the advantages of fortune, thoſe of the body.</p>
            <p>THIS publication, if it ſhould be executed with full effect, will certainly operate to a moſt eligible extent. To thoſe who chuſe to conſider it ſuperficially, it will yet be an important object, for, perhaps, more novelty and information will grow out of it than is contained in any work extant. As the anecdotes and the obſervations relate to all countries, and the Stage, in conſequence of conveying inſtruction through its influence on the ſenſes, has at all times boaſted admirers, from its higheſt patrons down to the loweſt orders of ſociety; it cannot fail of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to every ſort of reader; to facilitate which, care will be taken to keep the ſtyle of the narrative nervous, perſpicuous, and ſimple. To thoſe who have been deſirous, but not accuſtomed to read hiſtory, much information will be gathered from thoſe circumſtances in which ſome particular periods of the Stage will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lead to an elucidation of national events.</p>
            <p>AGAIN. The Hiſtory of the Theatre neceſſarily connects itſelf with the Hiſtory of the Opera. Muſic, therefore, as far as it relates to nature, and its effects on the paſſions, and which has been beſt felt through the medium of the Drama, will at different opportunities be treated on at conſiderable length; which will, of courſe, branch out the ſubject into Dance, Pantomime, and all thoſe extraneous objects which, according as their modes of introduction have varried, have ſometimes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and ſometimes ornamented the Theatre; nor will Painting eſcape obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſo the Hiſtory of the Stage, as far as it goes, may comprehend a Hiſtory of the Arts.</p>
