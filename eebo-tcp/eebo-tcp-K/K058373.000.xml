            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AGAINST
STOCK-JOBBING
Elections of PARLIAMENT Men.</head>
            <p>OF all the Nations in the World, we
may ſay, without Detracting from the
Character of our Native Country, that
<hi>England</hi> has, for ſome Ages paſt, been the moſt
Diſtracted with Diviſions and Parties among
themſelves.</p>
            <p>Union, and Charity, the one relating to our
Civil, the other to Religious Concerns,
are Stangers in the Land; and whether we
ſpeak of difference in Opinions, or differences
in Intereſt, we muſt own that we are the moſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0028102300:3"/>
Divided, Quarrelſome Nation under the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poland</hi> is the only Nation of <hi>Europe</hi> which
can pretend to Match us in this Ill-natur'd Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and yet all things examin'd <hi>Poland</hi> cannot
come near us.</p>
            <p>'Twas a true Character given of us, by the
Wiſeſt Princeſs that ever Govern'd us, Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were harder to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
in time of Peace than War.</p>
            <p>What Experience our preſent Governors have
had of this Old Maxim in the ſhort Peace we
have had, we leave to every Man's Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Not
to enter into the Hiſtory of the Diviſions,
and Civil Diſturbances in the Nations Peace,
which is too freſh in our Memories; and cannot
be review'd without ſenſible Regret by any
Man, who Loves his Country, or has the leaſt
regard to its Proſperity or Reputation.</p>
            <p>Yet we cannot but expreſs our ſenſe of the
Encreaſe, and more than ordinary progreſs of
this wrangling Temper, on the preſent Affairs
of the Publick; and with what Fatal ſucceſs it
Invades us in the moſt Minute, and moſt tender
Parts; with what ſubtilty it ſpreads its contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Qualities into the Vitals of the State, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0028102300:4"/>
from thence deſcends into the leſs Noble Parts,
the Trade of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Religion and the State have felt the plague of
Contention, eating out the very Entrails of the
Nation, and with a ſort of alternate Motion,
have equally come under its Malignant Effects,
for almoſt Four entire Centuries of Years, and
as if it was not enough to hurt us in thoſe two
Eſſentials of our Peace, behold the Plague is
broke out in our Trade, which is the third, and
next the other two, the Supreme Article of the
Kingdoms Proſperity.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we the Yeomandry, and poor Free-holders
of <hi>England,</hi> having, God knows, no Hand
in the Differences, tho' we have a deep ſhare in
the Damages, do take the freedom to make our
juſt Remarks upon the Cauſes, which, as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
have conduc'd too much to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unhappy Diviſions of the Nation; and
which, if ſome care be not taken to prevent it,
may compleat the Ruin of us all.</p>
            <p>The Wiſdom of late Parliaments have Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
two great Rivals in Trade, the Old, and
the New <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Companies.</p>
            <p>We do not pretend to Arraign the Juſtice of
thoſe <hi>Wonderful and Unintelligible Aſſemblies,</hi> if they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0028102300:5"/>
were in being, we dare not, and, ſince they
are not in being, 'tis not very Honourable, you'll
ſay, to ſpeak ill of the Dead.</p>
            <p>But thus far, we hope, without offence, we
may be allow'd to give our Opinions in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Affair, that tho' ſeparately and diſtinctly,
every part of the proceedings of thoſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
might be literally and poſitively Juſt,
and Right, we mean as to the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>Yet
when they are Conjunctively, and in the
General put together, and reflected on, they
ſeem to be clouded both as to the publick Intereſt;
and as to the Honour of the proceedings, with
dark Enigma's of State, and Inexplicable Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,
too hard for us to underſtand, ſuch as
theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That during the Being of one Company,
and before the Extent of their Charter, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
were Expir'd, we mean the 3 years al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
them for bringing Home their Effects,
there ſhould be Erected a New Company, with
power of immediate Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Had the New Company not commenc'd their Trade, till
the time of the Old was expir'd, or near it, there might
have been a Succeſſion of Companies, not two Rival Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
in Being together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0028102300:6"/>
2. That the manner of the Trading by the New
Company ſhould be ſo Order'd, as that the Old
Company by Subſcribing ſhou'd enable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Trade ſeparately, as a Company ſtill;
and that with ſo Capital a Stock, as always to
ſhare the Trade with the New Company; and ſo
at the ſame time two contraries be upheld by
the ſame Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Had the New Company been ſo Eſtabliſh'd, that at the
Expiration of the Old, it ſhou'd have had a Commanding
Superiority, by which no other Men cou'd have Traded,
but under them, by Permiſſion at the ſame time, leaving
all Men at liberty to come in and Trade with them,
there had been then no Rivals in the Trade, which will,
no queſtion, as they now ſtand, ſoon reduce the Trade to
very low Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That after this New Company was Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
and the Mony paid in, to the Uſe of
the Government, <hi>which ſome ſay was the thing which
firſt mov'd the Conception of a New Company, and which,
if the Old Company wou'd have procur'd, they had never
been Broke nor the New one Born.</hi> That after this
New Company was Erected, the Stock advanc'd,
and the Mony to the Government pay'd they
ſhou'd prohibit by Act of Parliament Two Thirds
of their Trade, and ſo Starve the Child they had
Begotten.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0028102300:7"/>
               <hi>If the Trade was ruinous to the Engliſh Manufactures,
and the Intereſt of the Nation it ſhou'd have been foreſeen,
before Gentlemen had payd their Mony, or elſe it ſhou'd
not have been Examin'd afterwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That after all this they ſhou'd grant a New
Charter to the Old Company, by Virtue of
which they have both Power and Time to Trade,
to the prejudice of the New, even to their Hearts
Content.</p>
            <p>We ſay nothing of thoſe particulars but thus,
that really we do not underſtand the conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of them with themſelves, they ſtand to us as
Arcana's of Policy, too high to be medled with.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhou'd we trouble our Heads about them,
but leave both Companies to confound one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as we believe they will; but that we find ſo
great a part of the Nation concern'd in their
Quarrel, as gives us cauſe to Obſerve, that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
of them ſeems to threaten the Nation with
ſomething Fatal.</p>
            <p>For the Power of theſe two Rivals is ſo great,
and their Intereſt in the Kingdom ſo popular and
High, that Matters of higher Moment than
Trade ſeem to depend upon them, while all
the proceedings of their Members, both in the
City, and in the late Parliament, in both which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0028102300:8"/>
their Parties have been numerous, are, and have
been guided according to their Intereſt in their
reſpective Companies.</p>
            <p>The Grand Work which the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is now Intent upon, is chuſing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
in Parliament, Chuſing Men to
Meet, and adviſe with the King about the moſt
Important Affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And while all Men ought to be fixing their
Eyes upon ſuch Men as are beſt Qualified to Sit
in that Place of Honour, and to Examine who
are fitteſt to be Intruſted with the Religion and
Peace of <hi>England,</hi> and perhaps of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we are plagu'd with the Impertinence of
two <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Companies, as if the Intereſt of either
Company were to be Nam'd in the Day with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion and the publick Peace,</hi> or as if they, who
are fit to be Repreſentatives of the People in the
great Matters of Peace and War, Leagues, and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of Neighbours, Succeſſion of Crowns, and
Protection of the Proteſtant Religion, ſhould
not be capable of deciding the petty Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
in Trade between two Rivial Companies.</p>
            <p>The Grand Queſtion ask'd now, when your
Vote is requir'd for a Parliament Man, is not as it
ought to be, Is he a Man of Senſe, of Religion, of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
and Eſtate?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0028102300:9"/>
But, What Company is he for, the New, or
the Old?</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>A. M.</hi> ſet up as a Candidate in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Borough, Who ſet him up? 'Tis
known he is no Inhabitant there, nor ever was,
has no Free-hold, or Copy-hold, or Leaſe-hold
Eſtate there, nor is not known there, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
poſſibly was not acquainted with 20 People
there.</p>
            <p>But enquire what Company he is for; and
then ſee if all the reſt of that Company were not
found running over the Water, to make their
Intereſt with their Friends for his Election.</p>
            <p>And the Time would fail us, and the Paper
too, to give you a Liſt of the Shop-keepers,
Merchants, and Pedlers, and the Stock-Jobbers,
who, with their Hir'd Liveries, in Coaches, and
Six Horſes, who, God knows, never had Coach
or Livery of their own, are come down into the
Countreys, being detach'd from <hi>London,</hi> by either
Company to get themſelves choſen Parliament-Men,
by thoſe Boroughs, who are eaſie to be
Impos'd upon, and who, like well-meaning Men,
that know nothing of the Matter, Chooſe them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Recommendation of the Pountry Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that have Intereſt in the Towns, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0028102300:10"/>
Country Gentlemen are prevail'd upon to quit
their own pretenſions, to advance theirs; but
by what Arguments we cannot pretend to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>We
have formerly been told that ſpending Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
upon the Inhabitants of Towns, was a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
practice; and no doubt it was, and an Act
of Parliament has been wiſely made to prevent
it.</p>
            <p>What any Man cou'd propoſe to himſelf by
ſpending 2000 (nay, 11000 pound was ſpent
at the Town of <hi>Winchelſea</hi>) to be choſen to Sit
in a Houſe, where there is not one Farthing to be
gotten honeſtly, was a Myſtery every one did not
underſtand.</p>
            <p>But here is a New way of getting Mony: For
if a Country Gentleman has ſo much Intereſt in
a Town, that he can be choſen a Member of
Parliament, if he will decline it, here is a ſort of
Folks they call <hi>Stock-Jobbers,</hi> help him to a 1000
G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>s for his Intereſt.</p>
            <p>This is Parliament-Jobbing, and a New
Trade, which as we thought it the Duty of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Free-holders thus to Expoſe, we hope an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament will think it their Duty to
prevent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0028102300:11"/>
For as this Stock-Jobbing in its own Nature,
is only a new Invented ſort of <hi>Deceptio Viſus,</hi> a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerde-main</hi>
in Trade; ſo mix'd with Trick and
Cheat, that twou'd puzzle a good <hi>Logician</hi> to
make it out by <hi>Syllogiſm:</hi> So nothing can be more
Fatal in <hi>England</hi> to our preſent Conſtitution;
and which in time may be ſo to our Liberty and
Religion, than to have the Intereſts of Elections
Jobb'd upon Exchange for Mony, and Transfer'd
like <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Stock, to thoſe who bid moſt.</p>
            <p>By this Method, the Country Gentlemen may
ſit at Home; and only Correſponding with the
Brokers at <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s and <hi>Garraway's,</hi> as the Prizes
Riſe or Fall, they may diſpoſe of their Intereſts
in the Towns they can Govern, at as good a
rate as they can.</p>
            <p>The Citizens, or ſuch who have their ſeveral
Companies and Intereſt to Serve, will Eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the Expence of Travelling, with the
fine borrow'd Equipages before mention'd; and
only go to Market in Exchange Alley, and Buy
an Election, as the Stock-Jobber and they ſhall
agree, which Election ſhall be manag'd by the
Country Gentleman, who is to have his Bargain,
no Purchaſe, no Pay, and is to go thro' with it,
or elſe he gets none of the Mony.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0028102300:12"/>
Elections of Parliament-Men are in a hopeful
way; and Parliaments themſelves, are in a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
way by this conciſe Method of Practice, to
come unde the abſolute Management of a few
Hands, and no doubt things will go on accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>Banks
and Stocks may be lay'd up, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in a ſhort time, for the purchaſing the
Intereſt of Gentlemen, and our Gentry being
willing to get a Penny in <hi>an Honeſt way,</hi> as we ſay,
will but too often ſell their Intereſts and their
Country too, eſpecially ſuch Gentlemen, whoſe
Eſtates are reduc'd to an occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>The truth of it is, 'tis a Paradox, a Riddle,
that we Country-men cannot underſtand, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cou'd, what makes our Gentlemen ſo fond
of being Parliament Men, we do not very well
underſtand what the Buſineſs is at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Only we find we are ſwingingly Tax'd;
and they tell us 'tis done by the Parliament; but
we never underſtood they had any of the Mony
themſelves, we always thought the Mony was
for the King, tho' they had the Giving of it,
then we ſee in the King's <hi>Proclamation</hi> for Calling
a Parliament, that it was to Adviſe with them,
about Affairs of the Higheſt Importance to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0028102300:13"/>
Kingdom. Now we cannot ſee they can get
any thing by coming together to be Advis'd
with, and our Knights of the Shire tell us they
get nothing by it. And here lies the Difficulty,
we can never reconcile their ſpending ſo much
Money to be Choſen, going up 200 Miles to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and ſpending ſix Months ſometimes there in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the Houſe, and all for nothing; we have
often been thinking there muſt be ſomething elſe
in the caſe, and we are afraid there is.</p>
            <p>Nor did ever any thing explain this Riddle ſo
much, as the ſtruggling of theſe two Companies
to make Members of Parliament; for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us ſeems thus:</p>
            <p>That they ſuppoſe which Company ſo ever
gets moſt Friends in the Houſe, will be moſt
likely to be farther Eſtabliſh'd, to the Ruin of
the other, and therefore they make ſuch a ſtir to
get Friends there.</p>
            <p>Whence firſt it muſt be ſuppos'd that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall not ſtand or fall by true Merrit, and that
Company be ſuppreſt that deſerves it; for if ſo,
it might be probable they wou'd both be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt;
for we apprehend they are both deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade in general and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0028102300:14"/>
But 2. It muſt be ſuppos'd that Friendſhip,
and Number of Voices only will decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy.</p>
            <p>And
in order to this the Stock-Jobbers, who
care not a Farthing which Side gets the better,
but makes a Prey of them both, have ſet up this
new Trade of Jobbing for Elections: And that
the way of their proceeding may be a little plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
underſtood, We deſire you to read the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

            <p>Now tho' the worthy Gentleman to whom
this Propoſal was made, rejected it with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
yet the Attempt is made very plain in
the caſe.</p>
            <p>And we are inform'd, that the Number of
Members come down into the Counties, on ſuch
accounts, are incredible.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we think it very needful to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
our Reſentments at ſuch a practice, and to
proteſt againſt it in this our Honeſt Plea, as an
indirect, wicked and pernicious Practice, and
which may be of very ill conſequence to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
on theſe following Accounts,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A hundred, or an hundred and fifty ſuch
Members in the Houſe, wou'd make a Dead
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0028102300:16"/>
Weight, as it us'd to be call'd, to carry any Vote
they are For, or Againſt, either in the Negative
or Affirmative, as they ſhall agree, and if ſo, it
will be almoſt in their Power to diſpoſe of our
Eſtates, Perſons, Liberties and Religion, as they
think fit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be true, as is very rational to ſuppoſe,
that they who will Buy will Sell; or if it be true,
which ſeems ſtill more rational, that they who
have Bought muſt Sell, muſt make a <hi>Penny</hi> of it,
or elſe they loſe their <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> and ſome their
Fortunes, which they expected to raiſe by theſe
mercenary Elections; then the Influence ſuch
a Number of Members, gotten into the Houſe
by the method We are ſpeaking of, will be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſelling our Trade, our Religion, our
Peace, our Effects, our King, our Crown, and
every thing that is Valluable, or Dear to the
Nation.</p>
            <p>If Stock-jobbing of Elections be the firſt ſtep,
in all probability Stock-jobbing of Votes will be
be the ſecond; for he that will give a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds, or more, only for a power to
Vote, expects to get ſomething by Voting, or
gives away his Money for nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0028102300:17"/>
What ſhall we ſay then, if a League of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
ſhou'd be made between our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Sollicitors,
and our Stock-jobbing-brokers,
two ſort of People equally mercenary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.</p>
            <p>We
deſire to know, whether 'twould not be
more fatal to <hi>England</hi> than the Union of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> which all <hi>Europe</hi> ſeems to be ſo much
diſturb'd at.</p>
            <p>In vain do We the Free-Holders of <hi>England</hi>
ſtrive to Chuſe Men of all the Six Characters,
mention'd by a late Author, in order to have a
Parliament every way Quallified for the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Affairs, his Majeſty has mentioned in his
Proclamation.</p>
            <p>In vain ſhall thoſe Gentlemen We choſe ſit,
and Vote in the Houſe, if ſuch a Generation as
We hear of are let into the Houſe, by the help
of their Money at the Boroughs and Towns, for
the Citizens and Burgeſſes out-run the Knigths in
Number above Three for One.</p>
            <p>We think 'tis no ſmall Misfortune to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Conſtitution, that ſo great a Number of
Members Choſen by the Corporations of <hi>England,</hi>
and, according to our weak Opinions, it ſeems
not equal, That all the Free-holders of a County
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0028102300:18"/>
ſhou'd be repreſented only by two Men, and
the Towns in the ſame County be repreſented by
above Forty, as it is in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and near the
like in other Counties.</p>
            <p>Again in ſome of theſe Corporations, where
the right of Voting is in the Mayor and Jurats;
in ſome the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common
Councel; in others the Mayor, Aldermen, and
Capital Burgeſſes; in others the Bayliff and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats,
and the like, the right of Voting is reduc'd
to ſo few, and thoſe ſo Mean and Mercenary,
that they are eaſily prevail'd with, to chuſe ſuch
as they know not, but are recommended by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And,
which is worſe, ſome Towns whoſe
Charters remain, tho' the Towns themſelves ſeem to
be Dead, are ſo mean and contemptible, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
remains of them but a Deſpicable Village,
with the Ruins of what they have been.</p>
            <p>We think it wou'd be but reaſonable, that the
Charters and Priviledges of Towns, ſhou'd die
with the Towns; and that whereas when they were
Popolous and Rich, they were Repreſented in
Parliament, becauſe they were ſo; when they
are Depopulated and Deſolate, there can be no
need of any Perſon to repreſent them, what can
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0028102300:19"/>
the Members, who have ſerv'd for the Town of
<hi>Winchelſea</hi> anſwer, if they were ask'd, who they
Repreſent, they muſt Anſwer they Repreſent
the Ruins and Vaults, the remain of a good
Old Town, now lying in Heaps; as for the
Inhabitants, they are not to be Nam'd among
the Liſt of the moſt deſpicable Endſhips, or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
in the County.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Branber</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> Old <hi>Sarum, Stockbridge, Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Quinburro,</hi> and multitudes of Towns the
like, who ſend up Gentlemen to repreſent Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
and have had more Mony ſpent at ſome of
their Elections, than all the Land in the Pariſhes
wou'd be worth, if Sold at a Hundred Years
Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>While on the other Hand, a great many good
Towns in <hi>England,</hi> being of more modern Riſe
in the World, are not permitted to chuſe at all,
and the City of <hi>London</hi> it ſelf, tho' ſome ſay it
bears a proportion to Six parts of the Kingdom,
ſends but Four Members of it ſelf; and but
Eight in the whole Circumference.</p>
            <p>This Inequality, we humbly conceive opens
the Door to the fraudulent practices, which have
all along been made uſe of in Elections, Buying
of Voices, giving Freedoms in Corporations, to
People Living out of Corporations, on purpoſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0028102300:20"/>
to make Votes, debauching the Electors, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whole Towns Drunk, and Feaſting them to
Exceſs for a Month, ſometimes two, or more,
in order to engage their Voices.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were ſo Notorious, and withal
ſo Ruinous to the Gentry themſelves, of whom
ſeveral Men of plentiful Eſtates have been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
Beggar'd and undone, that the Parliament
wiſely took notice of it, and have prohibited the
practice.</p>
            <p>But as if the Devil ow'd the Nation a Grudge,
and was rummaging his Invention to find it out;
here is a new project found out, to ſucceed the
other, which is Ten Fold more the Child of Hell
than that.</p>
            <p>Elections were obtain'd by thoſe Clandeſtine
Vicious ways, only to ſit in the Houſe in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
but here the deſign ſeems to be form'd
before-hand, what they wou'd be choſen for,
and the meaſures concerted, nay we have heard
that it may be known already, and Wagers have
been layd in, or near <hi>Exchange Alley,</hi> which
Company has moſt Friends in the enſuing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and how many of the Members of each
Company ſtand faireſt to be choſen.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Gentlemen who have Intelligence, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0028102300:21"/>
to ſuch nice Calculations, are equally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Jobbing the whole Nation; and as is
already noted, having gotten the way of Buying
and Selling, that is jobbing Elections, will ſoon
influence ſuch Perſons to Act, as the Mony they
are able to bid ſhall direct.</p>
            <p>'Twou'd be but a melancholly Thought, to
reflect that the matter of our Succeſſion, ſhou'd
come to be debated before a Parliament, that had
a Governing number of ſuch Members, who cou'd
imagine but that the ſettlement of our Crown
wou'd attend the higheſt bidder, and our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Liberty, Religion, and all that's dear to us,
be Mortgag'd to the Bribes of Forreigners.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King need not keep great Armies
on Foot, Build Ships, and Strengthen himſelf
at Sea to Ruin us, if the great Affairs of the
Kingdom concerted in Parliament ſhou'd come
to be prepar'd, manag'd, and byaſs'd at <hi>Garra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>'s
and <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, and expos'd to
Sale by a parcel of Stock-Jobbers.</p>
            <p>And how ſhall it be otherwiſe, they that can
make Members, will always Govern Members;
Creation ſuppoſes a Right of diſpoſing, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who Buy are Oblig'd to ſtand in good Terms
with the Broker, leaſt they ſhou'd find a better
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0028102300:22"/>
Chapman, and leave him in the lurch the next Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſo that by the Nature of the thing, they are
always ſubject to this Mercenary, Scandalous
thing, call'd a Broker, and he keeps them under
his Girdle, if he bids them Vote for, or againſt,
they do it, the miſchiefs are endles and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that may at tend it.</p>
            <p>To all Men whoſe Eyes are to be open'd with
Reaſon and Argument, it ſhou'd be enough to fill
them with abhorrence, to think that the Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Mechanick Upſtart Miſtery of Job-broke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhould grow upon the Nation; that ever
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſhou'd ſuffer themſelves to be
Impos'd upon by the New invented ways of a
few Needy Mercinaries, who can turn all Trade
into a Lottery, and make the <hi>Exchange</hi> a Gaming
Table: A thing, which like the Imaginary Coins
of Foreign Nations, have no reality in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but are plac'd as things which ſtand to be
Calculated, and Reduc'd into Value, a Trade
made up of Sharp and Trick, and manag'd with
Impudence and Banter.</p>
            <p>That Six or Eight Men ſhall Combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by pretended Buying or Selling among
themſelves, raiſe or ſink the Stock of the <hi>E. India</hi>
Company, to what extravagant pitch of Price
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0028102300:23"/>
they will, ſo to wheedle others ſometimes to
Buy, ſometimes to Sell, as their occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
and with ſo little regard to Intrinſick
Value, or the circumſtances of the Company,
that when the Company has a loſs, Stock ſhall
Riſe; when a great Sale, or a Rich Ship arriv'd,
it ſhall Fall: Sometimes run the Stock down to
35<hi>l.</hi> other times up to a 150<hi>l.</hi> and by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
Buy and Sell ſo much, that 'tis thought
there are few of the Noted Stock-jobbers, but what
have bought and ſold more Stock than both the
Companies poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>Thus let them Jobb, Trick, and Cheat one
another; and let them be bubbl'd by them that
know no better; but for God's ſake, Gentlemen,
do not let the Important Affairs of the State
come under their wicked clutches.</p>
            <p>Don't let them prepare our Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then Chuſe Members to Vote for
them. If Fate and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Confederacies, and Union
of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Powers abroad threaten us: Let us alone
to ſtruggle with them, and have Fair Law, and
Honourable Conditions for it; but to be Bought
and Sold, to have our Elections of Members, and
our Laws, Liberties and Eſtates Stock-jobb'd
away, is intollerable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0028102300:24"/>
Some, and not a few, of our Stock-jobbing
Brokers, are <hi>French</hi> Men, a little Correſpondence
between the <hi>French Court,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-houſe,</hi>
with a Currency of <hi>Louis D'ors,</hi> will make
ſtrange alterations here, if this method of Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Jobbing Elections ſhou'd go on.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> is the Governing
