            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COULD the author, Sir, imagine that you was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſable only by the ſteps of flattery and panegyrick, he would at once aſſign to you the united virtues and abilities of a PITT, a JOHNSON
<note n="*" place="bottom">The author of the Rambler.</note>, and a MEAD. But as he cannot conceive any thing more nauſeating to a ſenſible mind, will leave ſuch <hi>polluted</hi> offerings, and <hi>mean</hi> artifices to thoſe, who <hi>dreading your critic laſh,</hi> would <hi>thereby</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak your partiality. A method of addreſs this, which may at firſt perhaps, from its being a little <hi>unfaſhionable,</hi> ſeem to carry with it an air of vanity to ſome, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pride to others; but as the author is not himſelf conſcious of either, he will be as little affected by ſuch conſtructions, as he is by the <hi>ingenious</hi> writings of thoſe, who are ſaid to have laſhed the town with great humour and ſeverity
<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide C—LL and L—D'S <hi>reports</hi> of the play-houſe, in the two poems of the <hi>Roſciad</hi> and <hi>Actor.</hi> Alſo, C—N'S hiſtory of the manners and cuſtoms of London, in a paper call'd the <hi>Genius.</hi>
               </note>; whoſe particular freedom, and great illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality towards <hi>him</hi> (the preſent author) will, he hopes, ſo far bias you in your opinion, on the one hand, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpate him, on the other, as to prevent (ſhould curioſity, <hi>for want of other inducements,</hi> engage your peruſal of the following lines) any imputation or impeachment of <hi>that ſort,</hi> however deſerving you may think him of the <hi>laſh</hi> in other reſpects; for though he is ſenſible <hi>their</hi> having acted
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0149902600:3"/>an illiberal part, is by no means a ſufficient plea for him, yet he ventures to aſſert, that there are men in the world, who can be attacked no other way. Who have, nor know any other weapon, and who, if they do not find men guilty, will make them ſo: Such is the pride, malice and folly of the age we live in; which cannot, he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, be more ſtrongly exemplified than in the <hi>parſon</hi> C—LL, <hi>lawyer</hi> C—N, and <hi>critic</hi> L—YD.

An aſſertion ſtrongly confirmed by a <hi>quaere</hi> the author had put to him the other day by a Gentleman converſing with him upon the intended plan of his Retort.

            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0149902600:5"/>THE anecdote intended to be recited, is as follows—<q>When Demetrius was arraigned at Athens for tyranny, Menander was upon the verge of ſuffering death, on no other account whatever, than from a ſuppoſition and report prevailing of his being a friend and intimate of the traitor's.</q> Like him has the preſent author been moſt illiberally brought under the ſame laſh with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whom the NOBLE TRIUMVIRATE have thought proper to cenſure, vilify, and defame. And like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander too, has he ſuffered this, on no other <hi>apparent</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than from a ſeeming intimacy and friendſhip ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting between him and this Gentleman.
