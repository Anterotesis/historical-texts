            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>ALENTINE, a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Verona,</hi> is ſent by his Father to travel; he goes to <hi>Milan</hi> to attend the Emperor, and falls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in love with <hi>Silvia,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of that Place: ſhe returns his Affection with equal Ardour, but being promiſed by her Father to <hi>Thurio,</hi> a Man whom ſhe hates, they are obliged to keep their mutual Paſſion ſecret.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Protheus,</hi> the Friend of <hi>Valentine,</hi> remains at <hi>Veróna,</hi> courting <hi>Julia,</hi> a Lady with whom he had been long enamoured; juſt as he had obtained her Promiſe to reward his Love, his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0430500503:5"/>
Father ſends him likewiſe to the Emperor's Court: he parts with <hi>Julia</hi> with many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of eternal Conſtancy; but, at his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Milan,</hi> being introduced by his Friend <hi>Valentine</hi> to <hi>Sylvia,</hi> he forgets <hi>Julia,</hi> falls paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately in love with that Lady, and reſolves to gain her for himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> not ſuſpecting this Treachery in his Friend, acquaints him with the Hiſtory of his Love, and begs his Aſſiſtance in ſtealing away the Lady, who had conſented to marry him privately that Night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Protheus</hi> promiſes to ſerve him, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Buſineſs to avoid him, goes to the Duke, to whom he relates all that his Friend had juſt before intruſted him with. The Duke in a Rage confines his Daughter in a Tower, and baniſhes <hi>Valentiné</hi> from <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Protheus</hi> he employs to plead for <hi>Thurio</hi> to his Daughter, who by that Means getting Acceſs to her, declares his own Paſſion, and is repulſed with Diſdain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julia,</hi> ignorant of her Lover's Falſhood, and impatient of his Abſence, diſguiſes herſelf in the Habit of a Page, and travels to <hi>Milan</hi>; there ſhe lodges at the ſame Inn where her Lover does, and is informed by the Hoſt that <hi>Protheus</hi> was in love with the Duke's Daughter, to whom that Night, in <hi>Thurio</hi>'s Name, he gives a Serenade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0430500503:6"/>
                  <hi>Julia</hi> is preſent at the Muſic, which being over, <hi>Protheus</hi> entertains <hi>Sylvia</hi> with his Paſſion, in the hearing of his diſguiſed Miſtreſs, who retires to her Inn in great Diſcontent, where <hi>Protheus</hi> coming ſoon after, ſees her, and not knowing her, hires her for his Page.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> in his Journey to Mantua, is ſeized in a Foreſt by ſome Out-laws, who make him their King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvia</hi> having contrived to eſcape out of her Tower, follows her Lover, and paſſing through the Foreſt, is taken by thoſe Out-laws: the Duke, <hi>Protheus</hi> and <hi>Thurio</hi> follow her, and <hi>Julia Protheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Protheus</hi> finding her in the Hands of theſe Ruffians, who were going to offer her Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, reſcues her, but his Service being ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and his Love abſolutely denied, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens her with Force likewiſe. This happening near <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Cave, who, unſeen, had been a Witneſs of his Friend's Treachery, he ruſhes out, delivers <hi>Silvia,</hi> and making himſelf known, paſſionately upbraids <hi>Protheus</hi> with his Baſeneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Protheus,</hi> ſtruck with Remorſe and Shame, acknowledges his Guilt, profeſſes his Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and implores of his Friend Pardon. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> readily grants it, and as a Proof of his ſincere Reconcilement, offers to reſign <hi>Silvia</hi> to him; the diſguiſed <hi>Julia</hi> being preſent at this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0430500503:7"/>
ſwoons away; recovering, makes herſelf-known, and <hi>Protheus</hi> reconciles himſelf to her. The Out-laws bring in the Duke and <hi>Thurio,</hi> whom they had taken Priſoners; <hi>Valentine</hi> releaſes the Duke, but ſeeing Thurio about to ſeize <hi>Silvia</hi>; whom he calls his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he threatens him with inſtant Death if he does not reſign his Pretenſions. <hi>Thurio</hi> yields her with Contempt, which ſo diſpleaſes the Duke, who declares he is charmed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Conſtancy of <hi>Valentine,</hi> that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows her upon him, and pardoning the Out-laws at his Requeſt, they all return to <hi>Milan,</hi> to celebrate the double Nuptials.</p>
               <p>Part of the Plot of this Play is taken, from the Story of <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> in the Second Book of the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>George Montemayor,</hi> a Paſtoral Romance, tranſlated from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>'s time; the Loves of <hi>Protheus</hi> and <hi>Julia,</hi> in the Play their Characters and Adventures are the ſame, with thoſe of <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena</hi> in this Romance, whoſe Hiſtory is thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.</p>
               <p>Three Nymphs dedicated to the Service of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſtraying too far from the Temple of that Goddeſs, in which they reſided, are met in the Woods by as many ſavage Men, who, ſtruck with their Beauty, attempted to carry them away by force: their Cries drew a young Shepherdeſs to their Aſſiſtance, who being armed with a Bow and Quiver, ſhot her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſo ſucceſsfully at the Raviſhers, that, in a few Moments, ſhe laid them all breathleſs at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0430500503:8"/>
her Feet, and delivered the Nymphs from the Danger that threatened them. Her uncommon Beauty, the Dignity of her Mien, but above all, her ſurpriſing Valour, perſuaded the Nymphs ſhe was ſome Goddeſs, who had deſcended from Heaven to ſave them from Diſhonour.</p>
               <p>Full of this Idea they threw themſelves at her Feet, and, addreſſing her as a Divinity, return Thanks for the Aſſiſtance ſhe had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed them. The Shepherdeſs raiſing them from the Ground, aſſured them with Tears, that ſhe was no Goddeſs, but a mere Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and one of the weakeſt of her Sex, undone by Love, and ſinking under the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the moſt cruel Fortune.</p>
               <p>The Nymphs, moved by Compaſſion, and a grateful Senſe of the Obligation they owed her, endeavoured to ſooth her ſorrow, preſſed her to relate her Story, and promiſed her their Aſſiſtance. The Shepherdeſs being willing to gratify their friendly Curioſity, they ſeated themſelves on the Banks of a Rivulet that ran murmuring by them, when ſhe thus began her Story.</p>
               <p>"Know, fair Nymphs of the chaſte God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, that my native Country is <hi>Vandalia,</hi> a Province not far hence; my Father <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> eminent for his Birth, his Riches, and above all, for the native Sweetneſs and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Manners, was married very young to a Lady named <hi>Delia,</hi> with whom he was paſſionately in love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0430500503:9"/>Many Years elapſed, before it pleaſed the Gods to bleſs them with a Child; at length my Mother conceived in her old Age, and one Night, during her Pregnancy, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed with uneaſy Apprehenſions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſleep, ſhe deſired my Father to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate her Anxiety by reading ſome amuſing Story to her. My Father complied, and read <hi>The Judgment of</hi> Paris.</p>
               <p>My Mother taking Occaſion to moralize on this Story, condemned the Partiality of the Shepherd's Sentence. <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid ſhe, being intoxicated with a ſenſual Paſſion for Beauty, was incapable of conſidering, as he ought, the nobler Qualities of the Mind; heroic Virtue is the brighteſt of them all, and therefore the Goddeſs of Battles merited his Preference.</p>
               <p>The Contention was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t for the Prize of Virtue, but Beauty, replied my Father; the Apple was to be given to the faireſt; juſtly then did <hi>Paris</hi> beſtow it upon <hi>Venus,</hi> whoſe Charms were ſo greatly ſuperior to thoſe of her Competitors.</p>
               <p>The Apple was indeed inſcribed to the faireſt, anſwered my Mother, but that was not to be underſtood of corporeal, but intellectual Beauty, Fortitude being one of the chiefeſt Virtues of the Mind, and the Exerciſe of Arms, an exterior Act of this Virtue; had <hi>Paris</hi> been a wiſe and diſpaſſionate Judge, he would have given the Apple to the Goddeſs of Battles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0430500503:10"/>This Controverſy laſted ſo long, that my Mother being fatigued with talking, fell faſt aſleep. When, lo, the Goddeſs <hi>Venus</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her in a Dream, ſhining with celeſtial Charms; her Eyes expreſſed a certain Kind of amiable Severity; for Anger could have no dwelling on the Face of this charming Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and with a Voice, majeſtically ſweet, ſhe thus accoſted her.</p>
               <p>Whence <hi>Delia</hi> is this Contempt of a Power, who has been always favourable to thee? Haſt thou forgot the Time when thy ſoft Heart firſt glowed with tender Fires for thy <hi>Andronius?</hi> then didſt thou ſeek my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; then didſt thou implore my Aid; I heard, and granted all thy Deſires; and is it thus thou repayeſt me? but know, ungrateful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thou ſhalt not eſcape the Vengeance of an affronted Deity; thou ſhalt bring forth a Son and Daughter, but thou ſhalt not live to taſte the Joys of a Mother; the Moment of their Birth ſhall be the laſt of thy Life; nor ſhall my Vengeance ſtop here; thy wretched Offspring ſhall feel the Fury of my juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; they both ſhall languiſh with the Pangs of hopeleſs Love, and be the Victims of that Power thou haſt dared to deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>The Goddeſs ended, and vaniſhed from her Sight, when immediately the heavenly Form of <hi>Jove's</hi> own Daughter, the Divine <hi>Minerva,</hi> appeared before her, awfully ſweet ſhe ſmiled, and with a grave, but melodious Accent, thus ſpoke to her:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0430500503:11"/>The Goddeſs <hi>Pallas</hi> thanks thee, <hi>Delia,</hi> for the Concern thou haſt expreſſed for her Honour, and, as a Reward, ſhe promiſes thee to make thy Son and Daughter ſo powerful in Arms, that their Valour ſhall be the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their own, and the Admiration of all future Ages."</p>
               <p>This ſaid, ſhe diſappeared, and my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trembling with holy Awe, awaked.</p>
               <p>In leſs than a Month after, ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of me and a Twin-Brother, and, as the Goddeſs threatened, died immediately. My Father ſinking under an Exceſs of Sorrow for her Loſs, followed her in a few Months, leaving my Infant-Brother and myſelf to the Care of an Aunt, who was Abbeſs of a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery; with her we lived 'till we were twelve Years old, at which Age my Brother was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Court of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> where, in a few Years, the heroic Actions he performed in War, gained him an immortal Glory, which yet was not ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the Pains he has endured in Love.</p>
               <p>As for myſelf, I was removed from the Nunnery to the Houſe of my Grandmother, under whoſe Care I had hardly reached my ſeventeenth Year, ere I was ſeen, and to my Misfortune, loved by the ungrateful <hi>Felix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This young Nobleman having beheld me walking on a Terras, which was behind my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0430500503:12"/>
Grandmother's Houſe, and not far diſtant from his, he took all Opportunities to make his Paſſion known to me by ardent Looks, which I not ſeeming to underſtand, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to write to me, and practiſed ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully upon the eaſy yielding Temper of one of my Maids, named <hi>Roſina,</hi> that ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to deliver his Letter to me.</p>
               <p>The crafty Wench made uſe of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand little Artifices to induce me to receive this Letter, and though I was not diſpleaſed with her Importunities, yet aſſuming a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance as angry as I was able, I told her ſternly, that were I not reſtrained by a Senſe of what I owed my own Rank, and the Fear of the World's Cenſure, I would diſmiſs her from my Service, with the Infamy her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption merited.</p>
               <p>Methinks I have the artful Girl this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before my Eyes, cunningly diſſembling the Grief and Confuſion my Anger gave her with a counterfeited Smile.</p>
               <p>Believe me, Madam, ſaid ſhe, I meant no more by preſſing you to take this Letter, than to make you laugh. I did not imagine you would be offended, but ſince, contrary to my Expectations, I find you are, I will trouble you no more on this Subject; ſaying this, ſhe put the Letter again into her Pocket, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0430500503:13"/>Ah, how eagerly did my ſtraining By purſue her Steps! I died with deſire to ſee the Letter; but Pride and Modeſty, that made me refuſe it when ſhe intreated me, now joined with Shame to keep me from requiring it after the Anger I had affected.</p>
               <p>All that Day I continued penſive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy; at Night, when <hi>Roſina</hi> attended me in my Chamber, I waited with an anxious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience for a Renewal of that Diſcourſe with which I had ſeemed ſo much diſpleaſed in the Morning; but alas, I was diſappointed, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina</hi> either was, or appeared reſolved to mention the Letter no more. Yet to try if ſhe would faſten upon any Occaſion to offer it me again:</p>
               <p>And is it really ſo, <hi>Roſina,</hi> ſaid I, that Don <hi>Felix,</hi> without having any Regard to my Honour, dare preſume to write to me?</p>
               <p>"Alas, Madam, ſaid ſhe demurely, theſe Things will happen to young Ladies ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you; I am indeed concerned to find I have offended you by ſolliciting you to take his Letter, but it was occaſioned by my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your Severity in theſe Matters; but I beſeech you pardon me, for from this Moment I will never mention it to you again.</p>
               <p>This Steadineſs cruelly mortified me, yet did I diſſemble my Uneaſineſs while ſhe was preſent; that Night ſeemed twice as long as uſual; full of a Thouſand perplexing Thoughts I waited anxiouſly for Day, without once cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0430500503:14"/>
my Eyes. At length the Morning came, and <hi>Roſina,</hi> at her accuſtomed Hour, attending me at my Toilet, let fall the Letter near me, and, as I thought, on Purpoſe; which when I perceived, what is that you have dropt? ſaid I, ſhe anſwered, "it was nothing;" but I inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſeeing what had fallen.</p>
               <p>Bleſs me, Madam, ſaid ſhe, why ſhould you be ſo deſirous to ſee it? it is the Letter I would have given you Yeſterday.</p>
               <p>I don't believe you, anſwered I, therefore give it me that I may convict you of a Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; immediately ſhe put it into my Hands, aſſuring me, with an Emotion I knew to be feigned, that it was no other.</p>
               <p>You deceive me, cried I, ſtill diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, it is a Letter to yourſelf, from one of your Lovers, and I am reſolved to read it, that I may judge if he deſerves your Favour; ſaying this, I opened the Letter, which, as I expected, was addreſſed from Don <hi>Felix</hi> to myſelf.</p>
               <p>The tender and paſſionate Sentiments it contained, ſo wrought upon the native Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Temper, that I could not reſiſt the Deſire I felt to return an Anſwer to it, that might give him Hopes of my future Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. I now aſked Forgiveneſs of my Maid, for the Severity I had aſſumed, and wholly conſiding in her Truth and Affection, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the Contents of Don <hi>Felix</hi>'s Letter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0430500503:15"/>
to her, and begged her Aſſiſtance in conveying one to him: this ſhe readily promiſed, and as faithfully performed.</p>
               <p>My Letter being calculated to give him Hope, rather than Deſpair, my Lover omitted nothing that might contribute towards ſettling me in a firm Opinion of his Paſſion; every Day brought me a Letter, or ſome paſſionate Verſes; every Evening a Serenade under my Chamber Window. A whole Year rolled away in this Manner: at length being firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the Truth and Ardency of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I reſolved to make myſelf by Promiſe hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Don <hi>Felix</hi> could not reſolve to acquaint me with this cruel News, apprehenſive that my extream Grief upon bearing it, would affect him too deeply, he departed without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave.</p>
               <p>Ah, chaſte and lovely Nymphs! how ſhall I give you an Idea of the Pangs I ſuffered in his Abſence! Strangers as ye are to the ſort Tyranny of Love, how ſhall I make you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0430500503:16"/>
comprehend the Torments divided Lovers feel? I found them ſo inſupportable, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting what I owed my Sex, my Rank, and Fame, I quitted my Grandmother's Houſe, and in the Diſguiſe of a Page, travelled to that Court, where the dear Object of all my Wiſhes was.</p>
               <p>I was twenty Days in performing this journey, during which time my Diſguiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to great Inconveniences; but my eager Deſire to ſee Don <hi>Felix,</hi> made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them all. At my Arrival I hired a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Street leſs frequented than any other with Company. My anxious Impatience to ſee Don Felix, left me not room for any other Thoughts, but how to gratify this Wiſh; yet I durſt not enquire for him of my Hoſt, leſt my Flight being noiſed abroad, my Sex and Condition might have been ſuſpected; nor did I think it prudent to venture out to ſeek him, for fear I ſhould be obſerved.</p>
               <p>All Day I paſſed in this Perplexity; at length the Night approached, and brought with it an Increaſe of my Affliction, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Fatigue both of Body and Mind which I had endured, yet I could take no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; I toſſed and tumbled on my uneaſy Bed 'till Midnight, when my Hoſt knocking at my Chamber Door, told me, if I had any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hear ſome fine Muſic, I had nothing to do but to riſe and open the Window that lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Street. Ah me! in the diſtracted State my Mind was then in, I was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0430500503:17"/>
little capable of reliſhing Muſic, however charming it might be; yet did I riſe without thinking on what I was doing, and opening the Window, my Attention was immediately engaged by the Sound of a Voice that ſeemed familiar to my Ears; and liſtening eagerly, I perceived it was <hi>Fabius,</hi> a Page belonging to Don <hi>Felix,</hi> who calling to ſome Perſons at a little Diſtance, ſaid, now, my Maſters, it is time to begin, for the Lady is come into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery this Moment.</p>
               <p>Then immediately they began to play upon ſeveral Inſtruments, which, had I not been racked with a thouſand various Thoughts, might with the celeſtial Harmony they made, have charmed me into an Extaſy.</p>
               <p>The Muſic no ſooner ceaſed, than a Voice, which, by its raviſhing Sweetneſs, I knew to be Don <hi>Felix</hi>'s, ſung ſome tender and paſſionate Verſes, in which he complained of the extream Rigour of a Lady to whom he had devoted his Affections.</p>
               <p>That well known Voice lulled me into ſuch a ſweet Delirium of Joy, that forgetting thoſe fatal Verſes were addreſſed to another, the Image of our paſt Loves roſe freſh to my Remembrance, and my deceitful Imagination repreſented my Lover as formerly, breathing out thoſe melting Sounds to me: but this pleaſing Deluſion laſted not long; I ſoon recovered to a Senſe, a bitter Senſe of my deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and turning to my Hoſt, I aſked him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0430500503:18"/>
with a Sigh, that ſhook my whole Frame, if he knew the Lady for whoſe Sake that Muſic was performed.</p>
               <p>He anſwered, he did not, for there were ſo many fair and noble Ladies lived in that Street, that it was not eaſy to diſcover to which of them it was addreſſed.</p>
               <p>Finding he could not ſatisfy me in this particular, I lent my whole Attention again to the Voice of my unfaithful Lover, but ah! with different Senſations; for now my Soul was filled with the moſt gloomy Deſpair. The Morning dawn'd before this hateful Serenade was ended; I withdrew again to my Bed, and with a River of Tears bewailed my own Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the Inconſtancy of Don <hi>Felix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great Part of the Day being waſted in this Manner, I roſe, and putting on my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, went out of my Lodging, wandering thro' the Streets, without any determined Deſign, yet anxiouſly wiſhing to ſee my perjured Lover.</p>
               <p>Chance brought me to the Gates of the Palace; I entered a broad paved Court that was before it, and beheld a great many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, young, beautiful, and richly adorned, ſhewing themſelves at the Windows to the young Noblemen, who were riding backwards and forwards below, and whoſe Eyes were differently directed, as the Objects of their Deſires were placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0430500503:19"/>While I continued ſtanding near the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-Gate in hopes of ſeeing Don <hi>Felix,</hi> whoſe new Miſtreſs I did not doubt was amongſt the Ladies there, I ſaw <hi>Fabius</hi> approach, and after ſpeaking a few Words to the Porter that kept the ſecond Entry, return, the ſame Way he came; my Heart beat with eager Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I imagined Don <hi>Felix</hi> was coming; I was not deceived, he came attended with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Servants, all dreſſed in rich Liveries of yellow Velvet, with white and blue Feathers in their Hats; my Lover himſelf was dreſt with the utmoſt Exactneſs, and wore Feathers of the ſame Colours in his Hat.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he arrived at the Palace-Gate, he diſmounted, and went up the Stairs that led to the Chamber of Preſence.</p>
               <p>The Extreams of Joy and Grief in which my Soul was toſt at that tranſient View of him, whom I ſo paſſionately loved, and whoſe Falſhood I ſo tenderly lamented, kept me a long Time motionleſs in the Place where I ſtood.</p>
               <p>At laſt recovering myſelf a little, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Fabius</hi> waiting his coming out with the reſt of his Attendants, and ſtepping up to him, I drew him aſide, and aſked him who that Nobleman was that had juſt entered the Palace."</p>
               <p>Thou muſt beeds be a Stranger here, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, if thou knoweſt not Don <hi>Felix</hi>; why,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0430500503:20"/>
Youth, I tell thee, there is not any Nobleman in the Court better known than Don <hi>Felix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be ſo, ſaid I, but I am a Stranger, and would be glad to be informed if he has any particular Reaſon for giving Liveries of theſe Colours.</p>
               <p>If it were not ſo well known, replied he, I would conceal it, but ſince any other Perſon can acquaint thee with it as well as myſelf, I'll tell thee the Reaſon; he loves a Lady of this City, named <hi>Celia,</hi> and 'tis her Colours that he wears.</p>
               <p>My wounded Heart bled afreſh at this Confirmation of my Unhappineſs, yet I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled my Emotion, and continued talking to the Page about his Maſter's Paſſion, from whom I gathered that the Lady did not receive it with any Marks of Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>This Aſſurance animated my drooping Spirits, I purſued the Converſation, and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> following the Cuſtom of Pages, very freely acquainted me with all his Maſter's Affairs, from which making a quick Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to mine, he aſked me my Name, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Condition.</p>
               <p>I told him my Name was <hi>Valerius,</hi> my Country, <hi>Vandalia,</hi> and that as yet I had ſerved no Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> being deſirous, as I was his Countryman, to have me for a Fellow-ſervant,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0430500503:21"/>
told me, that his Lord had ordered him to enquire for a Page for him, and that he would recommend me, provided it was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my Inclination: this Propoſal I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accepted, as it afforded me the Means of ſeeing my Don <hi>Felix</hi> every Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> having mentioned me to him, he ordered my Attendance on him that Evening, and being pleaſed with my Appearance, hired me immediately. Alas, this Situation was productive of new Miſeries, for now I was a Witneſs, a mournful Witneſs to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, Letters, and Preſents that were daily ſent my Rival.</p>
               <p>"After I had been a Month in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Don <hi>Felix,</hi> who had conceived an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Liking for me, communicated to me the whole Story of his Paſſion for <hi>Celia,</hi> and gave me a Letter for her, which he charged me to deliver, if poſſible, into her own Hands. Judge, charming Nymphs, if this Commiſſion was not painful, yet I undertook it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing an Audience of the Lady, preſented her the Letter: <hi>Celia</hi> looking fixedly upon me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Letter, as it ſhould ſeem, without knowing what ſhe did. She bluſhed, and grew pale alternately, and not able for ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes to remove her Eyes from my Face, ſhe gazed on me with ſuch a viſible Emotion, that I plainly perceived my Sight had cauſed ſome great Alteration in her Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0430500503:22"/>Recovering herſelf, at length ſhe opened the Letter, and haſtily glancing it over, threw it aſide, and again directed her Looks to me."</p>
               <p>Fortune, ſaid ſhe, after a little Pauſe, has been very favourable to Don <hi>Felix,</hi> in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to this Court to be his Page."</p>
               <p>And to me alſo, Madam, ſaid I, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me an Opportunity of ſeeing a Lady, whoſe Beauty has, in my Opinion, no equal in the World."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Celia</hi> ſmiling, told me, I had learned of my Maſter to flatter; yet ſhe did not ſeem diſpleaſed with my Diſcourſe, but protracted my Stay by aſking me a great many Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> to whom ſhe had heard Don <hi>Felix</hi> had formerly paid his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes.</p>
               <p>I ſighed and bluſhed when ſhe mentioned my Name, but my Emotion eſcaped her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and having ſatisfied her Curioſity about <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> whoſe Beauty, Wit, and Love for Don <hi>Felix,</hi> were the Subjects of her Interrogatories, I entreated her to ſend ſome kind Meſſage to my Maſter."</p>
               <p>Tell him, ſaid ſhe, that I have read his Letter, and am willing to believe the Truth of his Profeſſions; but, <hi>Valerius,</hi> added ſhe, in a lower Voice, this Favour your Maſter owes to you, I perceive you love him, and, and to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0430500503:23"/>
oblige you I condeſcend to give him this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction."</p>
               <p>She accompanied theſe Words with a Look ſo extreamly expreſſive, that I had not the leaſt Room to doubt the ſecret Purport of them. I bowed reſpectfully, and retired, full of Surprize at this unexpected Incident, yet not without a Hope it might produce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing favourable to my Love.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Felix</hi> finding the never received any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from <hi>Celia,</hi> unleſs I was the Bearer of his Letter, took Care always to aſſign me this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Celia,</hi> by theſe Means, ſeeing me every Day, conceived a very violent Affection for me, which, however, ſhe only diſcovered by her Sighs and Looks; but her Indifference towards Don <hi>Felix</hi> was far from producing the Effects I hoped and expected: his Paſſion ſeemed to increaſe in Proportion as ſhe neglected him; and ſo great was his Deſpair, that apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it might endanger his Life, I, whom it might well be imagined, was the laſt Perſon in the World, who would ſollicit her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for him, I, fair Nymphs, threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her Feet, and with Tears beſought her to have ſome Regard to the ſad Condition to which her Rigour had reduced my Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Celia,</hi> who had flattered herſelf with the Hopes of having made ſome Impreſſion on my Heart; imagined by my ſuppliant Poſture, and the firſt Words I uttered, that I was going to plead for myſelf; but no ſooner did ſhe hear the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0430500503:24"/>
Name of Don <hi>Felix,</hi> than, loſing in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant all her former Complacency, her Cheeks glowed with indignant Bluſhes, her Eyes flaſhed a look of Rage and Diſappointment, and riſing from her Chair with trembling Emotion; 'Be gone, ungrateful, ſaid ſhe to me, is it for thy Maſter then thou pleadeſt, when thou haſt long known my Soul was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to thee? have I lived to be deſpiſed by ſuch a one as thou art? oh! curſed Fortune, oh, more curſed Love! but I will be revenged, if not on thee, I will on myſelf. My Death ſhall free me at once from thy ſcorn, and the Upbraidings of my own conſcious Mind."</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe flew into an adjoining Apartment, making faſt the Door after her, which left me not the Poſſibility of purſuing her, if I had had an Inclination to it.</p>
               <p>Grief and Amazement kept me for ſome Moments immoveable as a Statue; at length I departed, but my Thoughts were in ſuch Confuſion at the ſtrange Accident which had happened, that I came into the Preſence of Don <hi>Felix</hi> without being prepared with any Anſwer from <hi>Celia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His eager Interrogatories rouſing me from the deep Reverie into which I was plunged, I replied at Random that <hi>Celia</hi> was engaged with Company, and that I could not procure an Opportunity of ſpeaking to her.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Felix</hi> ſighing profoundly, told me, I muſt go then the next Day. I did, but oh!
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0430500503:25"/>
fair Nymphs of the chaſte Goddeſs, what was my Aſtoniſhment and Grief, when I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>Celia</hi>'s chief Attendant that ſhe was dead, having expired ſome Hours after I left her, in a fainting Fit.</p>
               <p>Had my Soul been leſs ſuſceptible of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Gratitude than it was, the Death of a Rival had not diſturbed it ſo much, but knowing myſelf to be the unhappy, though innocent Cauſe of her Death, I could not hear of it without feeling the deepeſt Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, the Apprehenſion of Don <hi>Felix</hi>'s Sorrow, increaſed to ſuch a Degree, that I was almoſt diſtracted.</p>
               <p>At my Return Home I found him loſt in the wildeſt Agonies of Deſpair; the News had already reached him; none of his Servants durſt approach him; he even commanded me, who was his Favourite, out of his Preſence: Heaven knows with what Reluctance I obeyed. —From that fatal Day I ſaw him no more, he departed without acquainting any of his Friends or Servants with the Place to which he deſigned to go.</p>
               <p>No Words can paint the Torments I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured at this new Misfortune; deprived of his Preſence for whom I only wiſhed to live, I loathed the Sight of Day, I curſed my Fate, my hapleſs Love, and all Things, but my <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Agonies were too violent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long; Nature was too weak to ſupport

them; their Rage at Length ſubſided; a calm of Grief enſued, and Hope, the falſe intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friend, of Love, repreſented it ſtill poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to be happy if I could find my <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rouſed by this flattering Thought, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſeek him through the World, and have already waſted two Years in my Purſuit of him.</p>
               <p>Chance brought me to theſe Plains, where being ſtruck with the peaceful Simplicity of a paſtoral Life, and abſolutely deſpairing ever to ſee Don <hi>Felix</hi> more, I threw off the Habit of a Man, and in the Weeds of a Shepherdeſs, wandered through theſe Woods, ſtill nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Solitude and Tears the fatal Paſſion that conſumes me.</p>
               <p>Heaven, by affording me an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of delivering you, fair Nymphs, from the Danger with which you were threatened, ſeems to be preparing a Reverſe of Fate for me; the firſt Ray of Joy that ever dawned upon my Soul ſince the Abſence of my beloved Don <hi>Felix,</hi> was occaſioned by being made the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of your Deliverance; oh! may it be a happy Omen of Fortune's future Favours; let me hail it as the Beginning of that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Sight of my Don <hi>Felix</hi> will raiſe me to."</p>
               <p>The beautiful <hi>Feliſmena</hi> ended here, and the fair Votaries of <hi>Diana</hi> confirmed her in that

agreeable Hope, with Reaſons founded on the true Delicacy, and noble Perſeverance of her Paſſion; and all joining to intreat ſhe would conſent to reſide with them in the Palace of the ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> 'till Fortune had made ſome Change in her Affairs, ſhe readily embraced their Offer, and ſet out with them for the Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader, by comparing the Incidents that compoſe the Fable of <hi>The Two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Verona,</hi> with thoſe in the foregoing Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will eaſily perceive that <hi>Protheus</hi> and <hi>Julia</hi> in the Play are the ſame with <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Feliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> in the Novel.</p>
               <p>The Story, indeed, is highly romantic and improbable, and <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Judgment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting many of the Circumſtances might be praiſed, if thoſe he has invented were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually abſurd: 'tis generally allowed, that the Plot, Conduct, Manners, and Sentiments of this Play are extreamly deficient.</p>
               <p>The Court and Palace of the Duke of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> to which firſt Sir <hi>Valentine,</hi> and then Sir <hi>Protheus,</hi> are ſent to improve their Politeneſs in, has leſs Dignity and Decorum in it, than the Houſe of a private Gentleman. <hi>Silvia,</hi> the Duke's Daughter, notwithſtanding we are told with wonderful Simplicity, in different Paſſages of the Play, that ſhe is <hi>a virtuous civil Gentlewoman,</hi> yet behaves with all the ruſtic Smartneſs, and awkward Gaiety of a Village Coquet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0430500503:28"/>She is introduced flirting from Room to Room, followed by two of her Lovers, and laughing equally at the Man ſhe favours, and him ſhe rejects, ſlyly inciting them to quarrel, and when ſhe has ſet them together by the Ears, enjoys the Jeſt, 'till the good Prince, her Father, comes in to part them.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Courtſhip of this Princeſs, it muſt be confeſſed, is extreamly ſingular, and the Appearance of his dirty Footman, <hi>Speed,</hi> in the <hi>Preſence-Chamber,</hi> breaking Jeſts upon his Maſter and her Highneſs, while they are diſcourſing, has ſomething in it very new and uncommon. The following Scene will give the Reader a Specimen of Sir <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, the Wit of his Servant, and the prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Breeding of <hi>Silvia,</hi> the Duke's Daughter.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0430500503:34"/>The poor Princeſs being in ſuch a perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Situation, confined, guarded, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to have any Correſpondence with any Perſon, but her deſtined Husband <hi>Thurio,</hi> and her Lover's falſe Friend <hi>Protheus</hi> one would imagine ſome great Degree of Invention muſt be exerted to contrive a probable Stratagem to releaſe her.</p>
               <p>The Poet gets over this Difficulty with wonderful Eaſe: <hi>Silvia</hi> is ſhewn talking from her Chamber-window in the Tower in broad Day, to Sir <hi>Eglamour,</hi> her Confidant, below, ſettling with him, whom ſhe deſires to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her, the Method of her Eſcape, which is to be effected by his meeting her with Horſes at Friar <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Cell, whither ſhe intends to go to Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>To make all this probable, 'tis neceſſary that the Spies and Guards ſet over this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, muſt be all blind, otherwiſe ſhe and Sir <hi>Eglamour</hi> muſt unavoidably be ſeen by them. —Tis alſo neceſſary that they ſhould be deaf, or elſe they could not fail to hear the whole Contrivance; for her Chamber, we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is in a high Tower, at a great Diſtance from the Ground, which made it impaſſible for Sir <hi>Eglamour</hi> and her to ſettle their Schemes in Whiſpers: and laſtly, 'tis abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that this confined Princeſs ſhould have the Liberty of rambling alone out of her Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Confeſſion, or ſhe could not ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0430500503:35"/>
make an Aſſignation with <hi>Eglamour</hi> at Friar <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Cell, nor ſo ſecurely keep it.</p>
               <p>Nothing, can be more inconſiſtent than the Character of <hi>Valentine</hi>; nothing more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than the Manners attributed to him as a Lover.</p>
               <p>Paſſionately enamoured as he is with <hi>Silvia,</hi> he recommends a new Lover to her with the utmoſt Earneſtneſs, and will not be ſatisfied 'till ſhe promiſes to entertain him.</p>
               <p>When he is baniſhed to <hi>Milan,</hi> and in the extreameſt Deſpair for the Loſs of his Miſtreſs, the Fear of Death prevails upon him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Head of a Gang of Banditti, and having in this Situation fortunately reſcued his beloved <hi>Silvia,</hi> from the Violence of his treacherous Friend, who was going to raviſh her, a few repentant Words uttered by that Friend, makes him reſolve to reſign her to him, notwithſtanding the generous Proof ſhe had given him of her Tenderneſs, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo many Hazards to be with him.</p>

               <p>This Part of the Intrigue of the Play, ſuch as it is, that relates to the Loves of <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Valentine,</hi> is probably the Poet's own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the Adventure of <hi>Julia</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> are copied cloſely from the Paſtoral Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p>The Poet drops the Story at the Flight of <hi>Silvia,</hi> and adds all the remaining Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>He alſo paints <hi>Protheus</hi> in much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous Colours, than he is repreſented in the Original; there we find him indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant to his Miſtreſs, who loves him paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, and forſaking her for one that treats him with the utmoſt Diſdain.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſhews him treacherous in the higheſt Degree to his Friend, baſe and ungrateful to the Duke his Benefactor, and guilty of intended Violence towards the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he profeſſes to love; yet, wicked as he is, he eſcapes not only without Puniſhment, but is made as happy as the renewed Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his injured Friend, and the inviolable Fidelity of his once loved <hi>Julia</hi> can make him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0430500503:37"/>The Character of <hi>Julia</hi> is much nearer the Original than that of <hi>Protheus</hi>; but in the Romance we find her, when ſhe is in the Quality of a Page to Don <hi>Felix,</hi> exerting a very extraordinary kind of Generoſity, in ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing her Rival's Favour for her Lover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> very judiciouſly makes her act a quite contrary Part, inſtead of endeavouring to move her Rival's Compaſſion for <hi>Protheus,</hi> ſhe tries to engage it for the unhappy Object of his former Affection, repreſenting her Love, her Conſtancy, her Grief at being abandoned, in the moſt pathetic Terms, and by artfully intermixing ſome Praiſes of her Beauty, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates the little Reliance ſhe ought to have upon the proſtituted Vows of a Man ſo prone to change.</p>
               <p>The Behaviour of <hi>Feliſmena</hi> upon her Maid's offering her a Letter from Don <hi>Felix,</hi> in the Romance, is plainly the Foundation of the following Scene in the Play; and though the Dialogue is not copied, yet the ridiculous Prudery of the Miſtreſs, and the artful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Maid, have ſo near a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, that it cannot be doubted <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> had it in his Eye.</p>

               <p>This Play every where abounds with the moſt ridiculous Abſurdities in the Plot and Conduct of the Incidents, as well as with the greateſt Improprieties in the Manners and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs, becauſe it is neceſſary ſhe ſhould meet with her Lover in the Wood, without having the Power of making herſelf inviſible, gets away from her Guards, and out of her high Tower, and gallops like an Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, attended only by one Squire to <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis no Wonder therefore, that in ſuch an Equipage, and engaged in ſuch a romantic De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſhe ſhould fall into the Hands of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0430500503:48"/>
Banditti; nor that ſhe ſhould meet with her Lover amongſt them, ſince the Poet had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared us for this wonderful Incident, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding one, full as aſtoniſhing, in making the noble Youth the Captain of this Band of Villains.</p>
               <p>It ſeeming neceſſary alſo to the Poet's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould fall into the ſame Danger, we find the good old Prince, upon the News of his Daughter's Flight, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diſpatching ſeveral Parties of his Guards different Ways to overtake and bring her back, mounting his Horſe himſelf, and with no other Attendants than <hi>Protheus,</hi> who is a Stranger in his Dominions, and <hi>Thurio,</hi> the fooliſh Knight he deſigned for his Son-in-law, riding-away in Search of her.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſy to ſee, that by this Management he muſt fall into the Hands of the Banditti, and accordingly there we meet with him next. The Duke's beſtowing his Daughter upon <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine,</hi> whom he finds at the Head of this deſperate Gang of Ruffians, after refuſing her to him, when he lived in his Court with an unblemiſhed Reputation, is indeed a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, as is alſo <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to reſign his beloved Miſtreſs to his falſe Friend, who had offered Violence to her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and <hi>Silvia's</hi> giving her Hand to him, after ſo ſtriking a Proof of his Indifference and Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit taking Notice of one Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among many others I ſhall paſs over; <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi>;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0430500503:49"/>
after having juſt before declared, that it is with Difficulty he reſtrains the Villains who had choſen him for their Chief from the moſt brutal Outrages, recommends them to the Duke's Favour with theſe Words;
<q>
                     <l>Theſe baniſh'd Men that I have kept withal,</l>
                     <l>Are Men endow'd with worthy Qualities:</l>
                     <l>Forgive them what they have committed here,</l>
                     <l>And let them be recalled from their Exile;</l>
                     <l>They are reform'd, civil, full of Good,</l>
                     <l>And fit for great Employment, worthy Lord.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Their Reformation muſt be very ſudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for 'tis not more than three Minutes ſince he had complained of their Villainy, and he could have no Opportunity of knowing this Change in their Manners, for from that Time, 'till the End of the Play, he has no farther Communication with them.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not enough to make him ſollicit their Pardon, but he muſt alſo recommend them to great Employments, and the poor eaſy Duke gives him an abſolute Power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for them as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>The Wit in this Play conſiſts in Puns, Quibbles, Antitheſes's, and playing upon Words, and the Humour is all divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Launce</hi> and his Dog. The laſt of theſe Perſonages is indeed a Mute, which thoſe, who contend for the Learning of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> may ſay, he introduced in Imitation of the Ancients, as he gives Riſe like thoſe in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0430500503:50"/>
ancient Comedy to ſeveral Incidents in the Play. I ſhall tranſcribe a Scene between <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> and <hi>Speed,</hi> and a Speech of <hi>Launcet</hi> to his Dog, which may ſerve as a Specimen of the Wit and Humour of the Comedy.</p>

                     <p>When a Man's Servant ſhall play the Cur with him, look you, it goes hard: One that I brought up of a Puppy; one that I ſaved from drowning, when three or four of his blind Brothers and Siſters went to it; I have taught him even as one would ſay, preciſely, Thus would I teach a Dog. I went to deliver him as a Preſent to Mrs. <hi>Sylvia,</hi> from my Maſter; and I came no ſooner into the Dining-Chamber, but he ſteps me to her Trencher, and ſteals her Capon's Leg. Oh! 'tis a foul Thing, when a Cur cannot keep himſelf in all Companies. I would have, as one would ſay, one that takes upon him to be a Dog indeed, to be, as it were, a Dog at all things. If I had no more Wit than he, to take a Fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for it; ſure as I live he had ſuffered for't. You ſhall judge: He thruſt me himſelf into the Company of three or four Gentlemen-like Dogs, under the Duke's Table. He had not been there (bleſs the Mark!) — — — Out with the Dog, ſays one: What Cur is that? ſays another: Whip him out, ſays a third: Hang him up, ſays the Duke.

the Dog: Ay, marry, I do, quoth he: You do him the more Wrong, quoth I; 'twas I did the Thing you wot of. He makes no more ado, but whips me out of the Chamber. How many Maſters would do this for their Servants! Nay, I'll be ſworn, I have ſat in the Stocks for Puddings he hath ſtolen; otherwiſe he had been executed. I have ſtood on the Pillory for Geeſe he hath killed; otherwiſe he had ſuffer'd for it.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Story of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War is well known; the Princes of <hi>Greece</hi> united in Arms for the Recovery of <hi>Helen,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her Rape, had beſieged <hi>Troy</hi> almoſt ten Years with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Succeſs; when <hi>Calcas,</hi> one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Lords of <hi>Troy,</hi> went over to their Party.</p>
               <p>To this Nobleman, who was very well ſkilled in Divine Myſteries, <hi>Apollo</hi> revealed the certain Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and to prevent his being a Partaker in the foredoom'd Deſolation of his Country, he ſtole privately out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fled to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp, making Uſe of his Skill in foreſeeing Things to come, to recommend him to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who finding great Advantage from this his Science, held him in high Eſteem.</p>
               <p>The News of <hi>Calcas</hi>'s Flight being ſpread through the City, the People enraged at his Treachery, were for ſacrificing all the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends he had left behind him to their Revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0430500503:58"/>
                  <hi>Creſſida,</hi> his only Daughter, a young Lady of exquiſite Beauty, being wholly ignorant of her Father's Flight, was more than any other aſtoniſhed at the News. Diſtracted with Shame for the Baſeneſs and Treachery of her Father, and wild with her Fears of the Inſults of the enraged Populace, ſhe caſt herſelf at the Feet of <hi>Hector</hi> in a mourning Habit, and, with Tears proteſting her own Innocence, implored his Protection.</p>
               <p>The generous Heart of <hi>Hector</hi> was greatly moved with the Diſtreſs of the kneeling Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He raiſed her up, and aſſured her, her Father's Treaſon ſhould reflect no Diſhonour upon her, that ſhe ſhould enjoy his Eſtates, and, if ſhe pleaſed, live happy in <hi>Troy</hi> under his Protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida</hi> thanked him with a graceful Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and returning to her Houſe, began, from thenceforward, to live with the greateſt Privacy and Retirement; ſo nicely conſcious ſhe was of her Father's Diſgrace, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately attentive to her own unhappy Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the People, charmed with her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, no longer remembered the Treaſon of her Father to her Diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>It was the Cuſtom in <hi>Troy</hi> to celebrate the Feaſt of <hi>Pallas</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> the King's Sons, with the Matrons and Maids of Quality, and the Knights of <hi>Troy,</hi> aſſiſted at this Solemnity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0430500503:59"/>The charming <hi>Creſſida,</hi> though dreſſed in a Widow's Habit, appeared with a thouſand Advantages among the Reſt. Her Beauty, like a bright Star breaking through the Veil of an envious Cloud, dazzled the whole Aſſembly; unmoved with the murmured Praiſes ſhe heard around her, and deſirous of eſcaping Notice, ſhe ſtood with humble Modeſty near the Door; bending her lovely Eyes on the Ground, while the Bluſhes which ſometimes crimſoned over her fair Face, and the ſweet Penſiveneſs of her Attitude, ſhewed her Thoughts were more employed on her Father's Unhappineſs, than the Admiration her Form excited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> whoſe Eyes were ever wandering in ſearch of fair Objects, though fixed on no particular one, was among the laſt, who took Notice of the beauteous <hi>Creſſida.</hi> This young Prince, gay, handſome, and a Warrior, had never felt the ſoft Inquietudes of Love; he deſpiſed the Power of the winged Deity, and triumphing in his own Indifference, laughed at the Torments of others; roving, as was his Cuſtom, through the Temple with ſome of his young Knights, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with wandering Glances the Ladies as they ſtood, often ſlily leering on his Companions, to obſerve if any of them breathed a Sigh, or darted a deſiring Look at one of them. The God of Love, offended with his continual Mockeries, bent his Bow that Moment in a Rage, and ſent one of his keeneſt Arrows to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0430500503:60"/>
his Heart: the lovely penſive <hi>Creſſida</hi> was the Object that fixed his Attention.</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! cried he to himſelf, while his Eyes feaſted on the raviſhing Beauties of her Face, Where haſt thou been hid thus long, thou that art ſo lovely fair? Where has ſuch matchleſs Beauty been concealed, that my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Eyes were never bleſſed with it before? While he was thus contemplating her with Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had 'till then been a Stranger to, <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſida</hi> raiſing her Head, turned her bright Eyes by Chance on <hi>Troilus,</hi> and with that Look com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Conqueſt of his Heart. He ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as with an ardent Gaze he met the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, yet too powerful Glance of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Beauty; and ſhe haſtily averting her Face, again he ſighed, and conſcious of his former Injuries to Love, turned to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to ſee if any of them obſerved his new Diſorder, leaving the Temple, at length he went Home to his own Palace.</p>
               <p>Solitude now was all he ſought, and diſmiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Companions, on Pretence of private Buſineſs, he retired to his Chamber to indulge his new Meditations, there making a Mirror of his Mind, he contemplated the Image of the beauteous <hi>Creſſida</hi>; his raptured Fancy dwelt upon the inchanting Look ſhe gave him, and every recollected Charm added Strength to the fatal Paſſion that conſumed him.</p>
               <p>Love giving new Ardour to the bright Flames of Glory, he ruſhed with more than
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0430500503:61"/>
mortal Courage to the Field; yet was it not his Hatred to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor his Deſire of preſerving the Town, which poured the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his reſiſtleſs Arm upon the Foe: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown he fought, but fought it only to make him more worthy of the lovely <hi>Creſſida.</hi> True Love is ever accompanied with Diffidence and Fear: <hi>Troilus,</hi> though a Prince, young, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Object of general Eſteem; yet pined in ſeeret, without daring to reveal his Paſſion to her who inſpired it.</p>
               <p>Deſpair took Poſſeſſion of his Soul at the ſame Moment that he became a Slave to Love; he paſſed whole Nights in S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> the Uncle of <hi>Creſſida,</hi> and the intimate Friend of <hi>Troilus,</hi> having for ſome time obſerved, and wondered at this ſtrange Alteration, reſolved to make him, if poſſible, diſcloſe the Cauſe: For this Purpoſe he went early one Morning to his Palace, and entering his Apartment, without giving any previous Notice, found the unhappy Youth ſeated on his Bed, his Arms folded paſſionately on his Breaſt, his Head reclined, and all the Marks of the moſt profound Sorrow ſtrongly impreſſed on his Countenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> loſt in Aſtoniſhment and Grief, ſtood ſome Moments at a Diſtance, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating

him without being perceived by the love-ſick Prince, whoſe Thoughts were ſo intenſely fixed on the Idea of the lovely <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſida,</hi> that he had no Eyes or Ears for external Objects. O ye Gods! exclaimed <hi>Pandarus</hi> at laſt, what can this mean, is it the <hi>Greeks,</hi> my Prince, that have reduced you to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? O Shame to Manhood! ſhall thoſe Enemies of our Country boaſt of having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown one of its ſtrongeſt Pillars? Or has ſome enthuſiaſtic Fit of Devotion ſiezed thy Mind, and given thee up to more than Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Softneſs? Art thou mourning for ſome imaginary Crime, and trying to appeaſe the offended Deities with Tears?</p>
               <p>The artful <hi>Pandarus</hi> ſpoke in this Manner, not becauſe he doubted the Courage of <hi>Troilus,</hi> of which he had given a Thouſand glorious Proofs, but that by this Reproach, he might awake him from that Lethargy of Woe in which he ſaw him ſunk, and rouſe him to a more noble Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The Prince ſlowly raiſing his Head, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Friend, with Eyes that betrayed no other Emotion than Grief; Ah, ſaid he, with a Voice almoſt ſmothered with Sighs, what ill Chance brought thee hither to behold my loſt Condition? Leave me, I conjure thee by the Gods, ſtay not to ſee me die, for well I know my Death will give thee Pain; and yet, alas, ſuch is my extream Affliction, that Death is all the Relief I can expect; but yet, purſued he, after a little Pauſe, and raiſing his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0430500503:63"/>
Voice, while a faint Bluſh diſpelled for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the languid Paleneſs of his Cheek, Think not, my <hi>Pandarus,</hi> that it is Dread of the <hi>Greeks</hi> which has brought thy Friend thus low; ah! 'tis a Power ſtronger far than theirs; not the united Force of their whole Army could ſink thy <hi>Troilus</hi> thus. My Soul, my Soul's ſubdued, and that's beyond their Reach. Oh, my <hi>Pandarus,</hi> enquire no more; I cannot, dare not, will not tell thee more; leave me, again I bid thee leave me, it is not fit the Cauſe of my Deſpair ſhould be revealed; no, let it reſt in everlaſting Silence, and periſh with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Alas! ſaid <hi>Pandarus,</hi> exceſſively moved, what is this Affliction that is to be concealed from me? Oh, Prince, if ever there was Love and Truth betwixt us, do not, I beſeech thee, do not commit ſo great a Cruelty, as to hide your Sorrows from me; if I cannot give you Comfort, I will partake your Pain. I have a Friend's Right in your Diſtreſs, deprive me not of it, leſt I ſuſpect your Truth, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you doubt mine.</p>
               <p>Ah! ſaid <hi>Troilus,</hi> ſighing, you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, my <hi>Pandarus</hi>; to you, and you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will I diſcover my Weakneſs. Love, to whoſe Power I have been ſo long a Rebel, hath ſhot his fierceſt Fires into my Heart; I burn, I rage with ardent Paſſion; I languiſh with Deſire, and, oh! Deſpair conſumes me. What have I then to do but die? ſince Death alone can free me from my Torments!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0430500503:64"/>Ah, Prince! ſaid <hi>Pandarus,</hi> it was unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done to conceal ſo long your Paſſion from your Friend. My Advice, my Aſſiſtance might, perhaps, 'ere this have made you happy. Alas! interrupted <hi>Troilus,</hi> thou who haſt been ſo unſucceſsful in Love, with what Confidence can'ſt thou undertake to make me happy?</p>
               <p>I have been unfortunate, 'tis true, replied <hi>Pandarus</hi>; but thoſe Misfortunes have taught me that Experience which you want: hence am I qualified to give you Counſel that may prevent your falling into the Evils I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Oft have I ſeen a blind Man walk ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, where one who was bleſt with perfect Sight has ſtumbled. Well does the Proverb ſay,
<q>A Fool full often may, a wiſe Man guide.</q>
A Whetſtone is not, indeed, an Inſtrument to carve with; but it ſharpens thoſe that do. If then you think I have committed Errors, let my Folly be your School; and learn therein to avoid what I have been undone by. Every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, my dear Prince, is beſt explained by its contrary. The Palate that never taſted Bitterneſs has not ſo quick a Reliſh for Sweets: The Heart that never languiſhed with Diſtreſs, is blunted to the gentle Thrils of Pleaſure. With White be Black compared; with Honour Shame; each by its different Qualities ſhews the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0430500503:65"/>The Prince appeared wholly inſenſible to this Diſcourſe, not once lifting up his Eyes, or giving the ſmalleſt Indication that he heard it. <hi>Pandarus,</hi> whoſe Reſentment was awakened by this Neglect, began to ſhake him by the Arm, as if he ſuppoſed him in a Lethargy; Rouſe, rouſe yourſelf, for ſhame, he cried, from this Stupidity; nor liſten like the droniſh Beaſt of Burden to what I ſay, who, when a Harp is playing, hears the Sound, but knows not that 'tis Muſic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> at this Reproach, raiſing his Head, with a deep Sigh, and fixing a languiſhing Look upon his Friend—Peace, Peace, cried he, I am not deaf, I have heard all thy Diſcourſe; but, in the Name of the immortal Gods! what are thy Proverbs to me? how will they help me? Leave me, O leave me to bewail my Fate: Thou can'ſt not cure me, Friend; I wiſh not to be cured; leave me, and let me die.</p>
               <p>Why, this is Madneſs, Prince, ſaid <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> (haſtily)—But one Word more, tell me the Name of this powerful Beauty that has charmed you; I'll haſten to her; I'll plead your Cauſe; I'll force her to have Compaſſion on you.</p>
               <p>Oh, no! interrupted <hi>Troilus</hi> (vehemently) that muſt not be, Wilt thou then die for a Woman, reſumed <hi>Pandarus</hi>! ſigh out thy Soul inglorious here at home, and preſs a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0430500503:66"/>
Couch with thy languid Limbs? Ah! ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe them in Armour as thou waſt wont, ruſh on the inſulting Foe, and turn your Grief to Fury and Revenge; ſo ſhall your Fall be uſeful to your Country: But if you ſink thus poorly under your Paſſion, and rather than reveal it die, your Name will be conſigned to Infamy for ever; your Death will be imputed to your Fear of the <hi>Greeks</hi>; and her you love, in common with the reſt of the World, will ſcorn and hate your Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> touched to his inmoſt Soul with this predicted Shame, ſtarted wildly from his Seat; and traverſing the Room with great Emotion, ſtopt ſuddenly, and looking fixedly on his Friend, Oh! ſaid he with a Sigh, what muſt I do!</p>
               <p>Tell me the Name of her you love, ſaid <hi>Pandarus</hi>; ſay, do I know her? If ſo, I ſhall ſucceed the better in my Applications.</p>
               <p>This Queſtion threw the love-ſick Prince into ſuch Confuſion, that, not being able, to ſtand, again he ſunk upon his Bed; his Face glowed with Bluſhes; his conſcious Eyes bent their Looks upon the Ground; he ſigh'd, he trembled, but continued ſilent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> heedfully obſerving his Emotion, exclaimed in a tranſported Tone; Ah, Prince! I ſee I am intereſted in this Fair One: by <hi>Venus</hi> and her ſportful Son you ſhall conceal her Name no longer.</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0430500503:67"/>And will you know her Name, ſaid <hi>Troilus,</hi> (trembling) Oh, my <hi>Pandarus!</hi> the Name of my ſweet Enemy is <hi>Creſſida,</hi> thy Niece, my Friend.</p>
               <p>Here his Voice falter'd; he ſtop'd, he ſigh'd, while Fear, Hope, and anxious Expectation at once aſſailed his Heart with all their Force, and gave ſuch Meaning to his wiſhing Eyes, that <hi>Pandarus,</hi> eager to relieve his Inquietude, ſtrained him to his Breaſt with an affectionate Embrace: Be comforted, my Prince, cried he (in a Tone that expreſſed the higheſt Degree of Satisfaction) <hi>Creſſida</hi> ſhall be yours, if I have any Power over her; you are worthy of her and ſhe of you; not <hi>Hellen</hi> herſelf can boaſt a brighter Form than <hi>Creſſida</hi>; add to that, her blooming Youth, her amiable Modeſty, the mingled Sweetneſs and Dignity of her Manners. —Oh, Prince! ſhe ſhall be yours; I ſwear by Heaven ſhe ſhall: no more complaining then; baniſh your Fears, and rely upon my Will and Power to make you happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> almoſt out of himſelf with Joy at this unexpected good Fortune, hung upon his Neck awhile in ſpeechleſs Tranſports; then ſuddenly exclaiming, Come now, ye <hi>Greeks</hi>! cried he, oppoſe your whole united Force againſt this Breaſt; <hi>Troilus</hi> ſhall ſtand it all! his Love ſhall give him double Vigour, and ye ſhall feel it to your Coſt! Oh, <hi>Pandarus!</hi> my Life and Death are in thy Hand; thou haſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0430500503:68"/>
reſtored me to myſelf; continue ſtill thy friendly Offices, and be the Guardian God of <hi>Troilus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farewell, my Friend, ſaid <hi>Pandarus</hi> (getting looſe from his Embraces) I will deſerve your Thanks; aſſure yourſelf I will: In the mean time, ſtrengthen your Heart with Hope; I go to ſeek your Happineſs.</p>
               <p>With theſe Words he retired; and <hi>Troilus,</hi> now animated with double Fires, called eagerly for his Armour, and, mounting his Horſe, ruſhed terrible to the Field: Happy was the <hi>Greek</hi> that fled the Thunder of his Arm that Day; inſpired with more than mortal Courage, like a vaſt Torrent, he poured reſiſtleſs on the Foe, and bore down all before him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Pandarus,</hi> anxiouſly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to perform the Promiſes he had made to <hi>Troilus,</hi> went to his Niece's Houſe; he found her alone in her Apartment, reading; and placing himſelf near her, after ſome general Diſcourſe, he objected to her mourning Habit and ſolitary Way of Life; which, on Account of her Father's diſgraceful Flight to the Enemies of his Country, ſhe ſtill continued to obſerve.</p>
               <p>Why, my charming Niece! ſaid he (purſuing his Diſcourſe) why do you waſte your Days in Lonelineſs and Woe? Your Beauty was not given you to be wrapt in Shades; nor muſt your Bloom of Youth be loſt in Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0430500503:69"/>
ſmiling God into your Boſom; and bleſs ſome worthy Lover with your Charms.</p>
               <p>Ah! Uncle, interrupted <hi>Creſſida,</hi> her Face glowing with Bluſhes, from you I little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to hear ſuch Diſcourſe; you, who ought rather to defend my Heart againſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Power of Love; will you aſſiſt the ſly Invader, and betray your <hi>Creſſida</hi> to Bondage? Alas! it is not for me to mix among the happy Youth of Troy; preſſed down as I am by my Father's Diſgrace, and my too conſcious feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: No; let me in Retirement conceal the Part I take in his Shame; Retirement, which, from being neceſſary, is become my Choice: Love will not ſeek me here; he flies the Miſerable, and only dwells with Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace.</p>
               <p>No more of theſe melancholy Reflexions, ſaid <hi>Pandarus</hi> (kiſſing away the Tears that fell from her charming Eyes) you know not how bountiful the Gods have been to you. Oh, Niece! they have beſtowed a Bleſſing on you greater than your moſt ſanguine Wiſhes durſt aſpire at.</p>
               <p>He ſtopp'd abruptly here; and, thinking he had ſaid enough to awaken the Woman's Curioſity in her, affected to talk of other Things; and, ſhortly after, roſe up to be gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida,</hi> who had been pleaſingly alarmed by what her Uncle had ſaid, and was greatly diſappointed at his diſcontinuing the Diſcourſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0430500503:70"/>
ſaw him about to depart with Uneaſineſs; ſhe wiſhed to be delivered from the Perplexity his Hints had thrown her into, but Shame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her from aſking an Explanation of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus</hi> obſerved her Confuſion with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he moved on towards the Door; ſhe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him with downcaſt Eyes; he turned to bid her farewel; adieu! anſwered ſhe, with Heſitation, then ſeeming to recollect at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant what had paſt, But will you go, ſaid ſhe, (bluſhing, and half averting her fair Face) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out telling me what good Fortune it is for which I ought this Day to thank the Gods?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panadarus,</hi> having brought her to the Point he deſired, took her Hand with a Smile, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to a Chair, ſeated himſelf cloſe by her: It would be cruel, my deareſt Niece, ſaid he, to keep you longer in Suſpence; know then you are beloved by one of the Sons of your King, the young, the brave, the lovely <hi>Troilus</hi>; never did any Heart glow with more ardent Fires than his: he languiſhes, he dies for you, my <hi>Creſſida</hi>; compaſſionate his Pains, reward him with your Heart, and taſte the Sweets of mutual Love.</p>
               <p>Ah, me! interrupted <hi>Creſſida,</hi> and is it for a Lover then, that I muſt thank the Gods! Is this the glorious Fortune they have deſtined for me! and can you, Oh, my Uncle! can you reſolve to lead me through the dangerous Paths of Pleaſure? You, who ought rather to watch over my unguarded Steps, and ſave me from the treacherous Baits of Love! Oh, <hi>Pallas!</hi> Guardian
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0430500503:71"/>
Goddeſs of my Youth, aſſiſt me now! direct me in this doubtful Maze of Fate, and ſave thy wretched Votary!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> beholding her in this Emotion, roſe from his Chair; I ſee, fair Niece, ſaid he, you are not diſpoſed to liſten to the Paſſion my Friend has for you; your Diſdain will kill him; I know it will; his Life depends upon your Smiles; and ſince my Intereſt with you is ſo ſmall, I'll ſhare his Fate: I cannot bear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches he will with Juſtice load me, when he finds how ineffectual my Sollicitations have been.— Do you ſigh, cruel Maid! ſaid he; (for, almoſt unknown to herſelf, ſhe breathed a deep-drawn Sigh) Ah, may it pleaſe the Gods to make you ſuffer in your Turn! As for me, ſince you ſuſpect I would betray your Virtue, you ſhall not ſee me ſoon again; happy if, by ſacrificing my own Life, I could ſave that of the noble <hi>Troilus</hi>; but it will not be: he loves too ardently to bear your Scorn without Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but I will ſhare his Fate, whatever it be; and ſince I cannot ſave him, I'll die with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida,</hi> alarmed at this Menace of her Uncle's, and at his riſing to leave her haſtily, ſeized his Arm; Stay, Oh ſtay! ſhe cried; all that is conſiſtent with my Honour I'll do to ſave you both: I'll ſee the Prince; I'll treat him mildly; I'll not forbid him to hope;—but aſk no more: my Honour's dearer to me than Life; ſwear your Deſigns extend no farther than what I have promiſed, and I am ſatisfied.</p>

                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> aſſuring her, with the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths, that he would not preſs her to any greater Compliances, perceiving her Fears were quieted, began to talk of indifferent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which, <hi>Creſſida,</hi> whoſe Soul was all in Tumult, liſtened to with great Impatience; interrupting him, at length; I would fain know, ſaid ſhe, (with a conſcious Bluſh) in what Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you firſt became acquainted with Prince <hi>Troilu</hi>'s Paſſion for me? Did he declare it to you himſelf? Does he know how to gild a Love-ſick Tale with ſoft prevailing Eloquence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> with a Smile of Pleaſure at this Demand, related to her, ſuccinctly, all that had paſſed between him and <hi>Troilus,</hi> and painted his Love and his Deſpair in Colours ſo lively, that the half-vanquiſhed <hi>Creſſida,</hi> unwilling her Uncle ſhould ſee her Emotions, roſe up, and begging his Excuſe, retired to her Cloſet, to contemplate at leiſure on what had befallen her: There firſt the Idea of <hi>Troilus,</hi> young, brave, and lovely as ſhe had ſeen him; tender, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and languiſhing as her Uncle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him, roſe to her Imagination. Softened and prepared by her artful Uncle to receive the dangerous Impreſſion, her Fancy dwelt with a Pleaſure, till then unknown, upon the Graces of his Form, his royal Birth, his exalted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in a Youth ſo blooming: her Vanity was flattered by the Preference he gave her to all the <hi>Trojan</hi> Beauties of the Court; and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, inſenſibly engaged by the Pains he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for her Sake, Love firſt entering her Soul
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0430500503:73"/>
in the Diſguiſe of Gratitude, waked there a lambent Flame, whoſe pleaſing Warmth play'd gently round her Heart, and filled it with a new and ſweet Senſation.</p>
               <p>While ſhe ſat thus, wholly loſt in pleaſing Reflexions, ſhe heard a loud Shouting in the Street, that rouſed her from her Reverie, and made her haſtily run to her Window to ſee the Occaſion of it; but what was her mingled Surpriſe and Confuſion when ſhe beheld Prince <hi>Troilus,</hi> the Object of her Contemplation!</p>
               <p>The young Hero having that Day performed the moſt amazing Acts of Valour, and driven the <hi>Greeks</hi> quite back to their Ships, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, amidſt the Acclamations of a numerous Croud, who made the Skies reſound with their loud Praiſes: He was ſeated on a bay Steed, who, by reaſon of the Wounds he had received in the Fight, carried him along with a ſlow Pace; all richly armed he was, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his Head; ſo that his lovely Face being expoſed to View, and made more lovely by the decent Shame which glowed in bright Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion on his Cheek, he charmed the eager Gazers into a Rapture of Delight: His Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, which hung careleſsly by a String behind, was hewn in twenty Places; his Shield was pierced with Spears, and many Arrows were to be ſeen ſtill ſticking in different Parts of it; his Horſe was marked with Blood that ſtreamed from ſeveral Parts of his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0430500503:74"/>In this fierce Equipage he would have look'd like the great God of War himſelf, had not his charming Face expreſſed a ſofter and more amiable Divinity: <hi>Creſſida</hi> drew back her Head the Moment ſhe beheld him; conſcious of what paſſed in her Heart, a crimſon Bluſh glowed in each lovely Cheek; but though ſhe had determined in her Mind not to look on him, again her Eyes involuntary ſought him out; again ſhe bluſhed, alarm'd at her own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; again with an averted Look ſhe tried to conceal the new-born ſweet Anxiety from her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but it was in vain: ſhe could not reſiſt the powerful Impulſe that drew her Eyes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; and kept them fixed upon him till he was out of Sight.</p>
               <p>This unexpected View of the young Hero, in all the Pomp and Pageantry of War, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the chiefeſt Honours of the Field, and crowned with the grateful Praiſes of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Country, compleated what her Uncle's Artifices had begun, and made an entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of her Heart: Love, with all its Train of gentle Wiſhes, Hopes, Fears, and ſoft In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes, took Poſſeſſion of her Breaſt: Awhile ſhe reſiſted the ſweet Invader, and oppoſed her Reaſon to the ſubtle Flame; but ſo unequal was the Conteſt, ſo weak her Defence, ſo powerful the Aſſault, that neither hoping, nor perhaps deſiring to be free, ſhe gave herſelf up a willing Slave to the ſoft Chains of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0430500503:75"/>In the mean time <hi>Troilus,</hi> full of eager Anxiety to know his Fate, no ſooner arrived at his own Palace than he diſpatched ſome of his Attendants to different Places to find out <hi>Pandarus,</hi> and to bring him thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus</hi> immediately obeyed the Summons, and related, to his impatient Friend, all the Converſation that had paſſed between him and his Niece. He deſcribed her Looks, her Sighs, her Bluſhes, her ſweet Irreſolution, and thence derived ſufficient Encouragement for the trembling Lover to write, and, in his own pathetic language, ſollicit her future Favour.</p>
               <p>Love having dictated, to the ready Pen of <hi>Troilus,</hi> the ſofteſt and moſt perſuaſive Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that ever won a female Heart, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> undertook to deliver the Letter, and accordingly carried it that Inſtant to <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſida:</hi> The mounting Blood fluſh'd in her charming Face as ſoon as he offered the Billet to her Peruſal; then ran again in Tides tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to her Heart, and left her pale, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and ready to ſink before him; he took her Hand, he preſſed it tenderly in his, he ſwore by all the celeſtial Deities, no Harm was meant to her Honour, and conjured her, if ſhe had not reſolved the Deſtruction of the noble <hi>Troilus,</hi> to read and anſwer his Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida,</hi> reaſſured by her Uncle's Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, took the Letter from him, and retired to her Chamber to read it. The moving lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0430500503:76"/>
it contained, had ſo ſudden and ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Effect on her ſoft Heart, that ſhe was eaſily prevailed upon, by her Uncle to write a favourable Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Correſpondence thus happily begun, the officious <hi>Pandarus</hi> never failed every Day to carry Letters, Meſſages, and Preſents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lovers, nor ceaſed his Solicitations in favour of <hi>Troilus</hi> to his Niece, till he had won her to yield to his Deſires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> at once the happy Favourite of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> and of <hi>Mars,</hi> was as glorious in the Field as ſucceſsful in his Love; the <hi>Greeks</hi> trembled at his Name, and the <hi>Trojans</hi> in him revered a ſecond <hi>Hector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida</hi> ſtill continuing her ſolitary way of Life, ſilently enjoyed the Praiſes of her beloved Hero; at her Feet the paſſionate Warrior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all his laurels; for her he fought and conquered, and ſought his Recompence only in her Smiles. But Fortune, weary of ſhower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Favours, on theſe happy Lovers, prepared a ſad Reverſe of Fate for them, and, when they leaſt expected it, ſtunned them with the Blow.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trojans</hi> in a general Battle with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> notwithſtanding the godlike Valour of their Chiefs, received a dreadful Defeat; the Loſs was ſo great, on their Side, that the venerable <hi>Priam</hi> found himſelf reduced to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0430500503:77"/>
Neceſſity of deſiring a Truce and an Exchange of Priſoners.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Chalcas,</hi> the Father of <hi>Creſſida,</hi> heard of this Propoſition, he preſented himſelf before the Council of War, and earneſtly intreated the Princes, that they would ſuffer <hi>Anterior,</hi> then a Priſoner in their Camp, to be exchanged for <hi>Creſſida</hi> his Daughter, whom he had left in <hi>Troy</hi> at his Departure. The <hi>Greek</hi> Princes conſented to his Requeſt, and thoſe that were named Commiſſioners for the <hi>Greeks</hi> with the <hi>Trojans,</hi> were ordered to demand <hi>Creſſida</hi> in exchange for <hi>Antenor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Arrival of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Envoys in <hi>Troy,</hi> King <hi>Priam</hi> ſummoned a Council to meet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they appeared and gave an Account of their Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Creſſida</hi> was named, the great Heart of <hi>Troilus</hi> ſunk within him, an aſhy Paleneſs overſpread his Face; convulſive ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings ſeized every Limb, and Grief and Rage were painted in his Eyes. With trembling Impatience he waited to hear the Opinion of the Council, revolving, in his diſtracted Soul, what he ſhould do in caſe they gave up <hi>Creſſida.</hi> Love ſuggeſted to him, that he ought rather to die than ſuffer <hi>Creſſida</hi> to be raviſhed from his Arms; but Reaſon repreſented, that it was fit the Charmer of his Soul ſhould be conſulted, as to her Intentions, ere he proceeded to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and then, if ſhe approved his firm Deſign to keep her, he would defend her
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0430500503:78"/>
againſt the united Force of all the Powers on Earth. Fain would he ſave her Honour, and prevent her Departure; and while his Thoughts were in this Tumult, <hi>Hector,</hi> who had well weighed the <hi>Grecians</hi> Demand, turned to the Envoys, and told them, that <hi>Creſſida</hi> was not a Priſoner, and therefore could not be included in the Treaty for Exchange of Priſoners; and tell your Princes, added he, We ſell no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he uttered theſe Words, when a Murmur of Diſlike ran through the whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which at laſt broke out into a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Exclamation againſt <hi>Hector</hi> for oppoſing the Return of <hi>Antenor</hi> on account of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>The venerable <hi>Priam,</hi> by his Authority, put an End to the Conteſt; and, declaring that it was his Will the Daughter of <hi>Calchas</hi> ſhould be exchanged for <hi>Antenor,</hi> the Aſſembly broke up ſatisfied with this determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> impatient of the ſmothered Grief and Rage that tore his inmoſt Soul, haſtened to his own Palace; with a frantic Air he flew to his Apartment, ſhut every Door and Window, and having, as much as lay in his Power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the hateful Light, he threw himſelf, with a deep and deadly Groan, upon his Bed; there, giving a Looſe to Sorrow, he paſſionately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided the cruel Gods as Authors of his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; he curſed his Fate, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> himſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elf, and <hi>Troy:</hi> Then, in the fierceſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Grief, he threw his groveling Body
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0430500503:79"/>
on the Ground; with cruel Blows he beat his groaning Breaſt, tore his disſheveled Hair, and abandoned himſelf to all the wild Exceſſes of the moſt confirmed Deſpair.</p>
               <p>Theſe Agonies at length ſubſiding, a Calm of Grief enſued; again he fell extended on his Bed, and, in faſt heaving Sighs and ſtreaming Tears, gave Vent to the Anguiſh of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus</hi> entering his Chamber, and finding him in this Condition, endeavoured, by all the ſoothing Arts he was Maſter of, to give him Comfort; but <hi>Troilus</hi> was deaf to his Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and exaſperated rather than ſoothed by the ineffectual Arguments he urged; again his Grief roſe up to Frenzy; again he uttered Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations againſt the Gods, and, in the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Woe, devoted himſelf to Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> terrified at a Deſpair ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, threw himſelf at his Feet, and conjured him to moderate his Affliction, and take no Reſolutions to his own Prejudice till he had conſulted <hi>Creſſida,</hi> and heard what ſhe had to propoſe; adding, that he would go immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to his Niece, and take Order for their private Interview.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus</hi> liſtened attentively to this Propoſal, and, a little ſoothed with the Hopes of ſeeing <hi>Creſſida,</hi> preſſed <hi>Pandarus</hi> to go that Inſtant and prepare her to receive him, promiſing his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0430500503:80"/>
Confidant to commit no Violence againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to acquieſce patiently in what his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſhould ordain for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus</hi> ſatisfied with this Aſſurance, left him, and went to his Niece's Houſe. The Report of her being exchanged for <hi>Antenor</hi> had already reached her Ears. She was reclined on a Couch in her Chamber, pale, motionleſs, and bathed in Tears. At her Uncle's Approach ſhe newly raiſed her Head, a freſh Stream of Tears guſhed from her charming Eyes, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately claſping her ivory Hands together, "Oh! Uncle, cried ſhe, with a Voice almoſt drowned in thick ſucceeding Sighs, to what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery hath Love and you introduced me!"</p>
               <p>Grief prevented her from ſpeaking more; her beauteous Head, like a Lilly overcharged with Rain, ſunk again upon her Pillow, and a Groan, that ſeemed to rend her lovely Frame to Pieces, ſpoke her Diſtreſs more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than the moſt expreſſive Words could do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus</hi> ſeating himſelf near her, beſought her, for her Lovers ſake, whoſe Grief had almoſt deprived him of Reaſon, to moderate her Sorrow, and give him an Example of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Conſtancy that might, by inciting him to imitate it, prevent the fatal Effects of his Deſpair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida,</hi> alarmed for her Lover's Safety, and ſuffering more in his Affliction than her own,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0430500503:81"/>
ſummoned up all her Courage in Order to receive him with ſome Degree of Conſtancy. On his Entrance into her Chamber ſhe roſe and met him with an eager Embrace, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, by a forced Serenity in her Aſpect, to diſpel that Cloud of Anguiſh that ſaddened eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Feature; but alas! her Face, that Image of Paradiſe, was pale and wan; the roſy Bloom was fled, the laughing Loves that uſed to play upon each dimpled Cheek was gone; Tears had dimmed the Luſtre of her ſtarry Eyes, and all the ſprightly Graces, that decked her every Look and Motion, were loſt in languiſhing Dejection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> ſtepping a few Paces back, gazed on her for ſome Moments in an empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Silence; while the big Sorrow, labouring for a Vent, ſo totally oppreſſed his vital Powers, that, ſtanding without Senſe or Motion, he looked like the ſad Image of Deſpair: Tears at one Inſtant gave Relief to both.</p>
               <p>The Power of Speech returned, and they broke into Complaints that might have pierced the moſt ſavage and inſenſible Hearts. A thouſand Schemes were planned to prevent their Parting, but all upon Reflexion proved im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable: The paſſionate <hi>Troilus,</hi> incapable of liſtning to any Thing but the Dictates of his Love, was for leaving his King and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his diſtreſſed Country, his weeping Friends, blaſting that Glory which in ſo many Well-fought Fields he had acquired, and only
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0430500503:82"/>
ſollicitous to preſerve his <hi>Creſſida,</hi> ſteal with her away from <hi>Troy,</hi> and give up all to Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida</hi> heard this Propoſal with Horror; ſhe loved his Fame; ſhe would not ſuffer him to ſacrifice it to her; ſhe repreſented to him the Weakneſs and Baſeneſs of ſuch a Reſolution, and deeply vowed never to conſent to any thing that might wound his Honour. Hear my <hi>Troilus,</hi> added ſhe, the only Expedient Fortune has left in our Power; ſuffer me to be ſent, according to the Decree of the Council, to my Father; I will carry with me a large Quantity of Treaſure which I will pretend was ſent to his Care by ſome of our Relations, who intend to take the firſt Opportunity of eſcaping to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp. Before the Truce is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired I will urge him to let me come once more to <hi>Troy,</hi> in order to ſecure the Remainder of our Friends Treaſure; he is covetous, and will be eaſily prevailed upon; on the tenth Day from my Departure you may expect me, and once more met, nothing but Death ſhall ſeparate us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> with Heart-breaking Sighs, gave a ſlow and ſad Aſſent to what ſhe had propoſed; but, full of racking Apprehenſions, a thouſand Times he begged her to be true. And ſhe, invoking all the celeſtial Deities, the Satyrs, Nymphs, and Fawns, and the infernal Gods, imprecated Curſes on herſelf if ever ſhe received a ſecond Love. The Morning was now broke, with ſpeechleſs Grief they parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0430500503:83"/>
                  <hi>Troilus</hi> went home to put himſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to attend his beloved <hi>Creſſida</hi> to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Place, where ſhe was to be exchanged for <hi>Antenor.</hi> At his return to her Houſe he found <hi>Diomede</hi> one of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Chiefs, with many Attendants waiting her coming out. The unhappy Lover could hardly prevent the mingled Rage and Grief that took Poſeſſion of his Soul at this Sight, from breaking into ſome Act of Violence againſt the Man that was going to rob him of all his Soul held dear. But mindful of the ſacred Truce, and more of his <hi>Creſſida</hi>'s Honour, he repreſſed the riſing Fury, nor gave the ſmothered Anguiſh leave to vent itſelf in Sighs. This painful Reſtraint laſted not long; the beautious <hi>Creſſida</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaluting <hi>Diomede</hi> with a languiſhing Sweetneſs, ſhe gave her Hand to <hi>Troilus</hi>; who having helped her on her Horſe they rode apart from the reſt of the Company, and poured out their Souls in mutual proteſtations of eternal Love and Fidelity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks,</hi> with <hi>Antenor,</hi> appearing in ſight, <hi>Troilus</hi> was obliged to yield to the ſad Neceſſity of parting. Remember, oh! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to be true, he cried, and keep your appointed Day. His faultering Tongue could pronounce no more. An aſhy Paleneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread his Face; he turned away abruptly and joined <hi>Antenor,</hi> while <hi>Diomede</hi> eagerly flew to the weeping <hi>Creſſida,</hi> and conducting her to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp, left her in the Embraces of her Father. The unhappy <hi>Troilus</hi> ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0430500503:84"/>
the Weight of an unſupportable Sorrow, returned to <hi>Troy</hi> unable to endure the Sight or Converſation of any of his Friends; he gave himſelf wholly up to Solitude and Deſpair.</p>
               <p>The ten Days in which ſhe had promiſed to come back, ſeemed, to his impatient Mind, as many tedious Ages; anxiouſly he counted the tardy Hours, and wondered at their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Length; now eagerly wiſhing for the Shades of Night, and now as impatient for the riſing Dawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> whom only he would admit to his Preſence, endeavoured to prevail upon him to bear the Abſence of his Niece with Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to wait calmly for her Return; but the diſtracted Lover was incapable of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Advice; his Soul was racked between the contrary Extremes of Hope and Fear; ſcarce were four Days of the deſtined Ten elapſed when, wild with Impatience, he rode to the Place where ſhe had appointed to meet him; there ſtopping, he caſt his wiſhing Eyes around, as if he expected to ſee her; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſappointed, returned with languiſhing Dejection to his Palace, and wore away the Night in Sighs and Tears.</p>
               <p>At length the appointed Day came; with fear-check'd Tranſport he traced the well-known Path, ſending his longing Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to hail the wiſhed Appearance of his <hi>Creſſida</hi>; and now the whiſpering Buſhes, and fleeting Shadows at a Diſtance, would
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0430500503:85"/>
cheat his Ears and Eyes with her Approach; then would he paſſionately fold his Arms, as if already they incloſed her, and with an exulting Voice cry out to <hi>Pandarus,</hi> She comes, my Friend, ſhe comes, dear, lovely, faithful <hi>Creſſida,</hi> oh how ſhall I repay ſuch wonderous Truth! But when Expectation was wearied by Delay, and no <hi>Creſſida</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confirm the flattering Hope, then would he ſink into a tender Deſpondency, and chide her Slowneſs with a Lover's Anger, which ſome new aſpiring Hope again removed, and gave him up to eager Expectation again to be followed by Diſappointment and Deſpair.</p>
               <p>The whole Day being paſt in this continued Succeſſion of Hopes and Fears, the Approach of Night brought with it a ſad Addition to his Grief; for having no longer any Probability of ſeeing his beloved <hi>Creſſida,</hi> he reſigned himſelf up to the moſt cruel Apprehenſions; ah! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſhe is falſe, he cried, the wretched <hi>Troilus</hi> is no more her Care! what have I to do but die, my <hi>Pandarus,</hi> ſince <hi>Creſſida</hi> has forſaken me?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandarus,</hi> tho' greatly ſurprized at his Niece's Breach of Promiſe, and perhaps ſuſpecting the worſt, yet anxious to remove from the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Youth that Load of Anguiſh that ſeemed ready to overwhelm him, invented a hundred Excuſes for her Delay; which he who dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing ſo much as a Confirmation of her Falſhood, eagerly graſped at, and, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the preſſing Inſtances of his Friend,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0430500503:86"/>
returned to the City. After a Night of ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Woe, no ſooner did the Morning dawn than he aroſe, and flew again to the appointed Place, hoping, and anxiouſly wiſhing, he had miſtaken the Day on which his <hi>Creſſida</hi> had promiſed to meet him; for many ſucceſſive Days did he continue this Practice, living all the while in ſuch a Whirl of contrary Paſſions, as drove him almoſt to Frenzy.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Creſſida,</hi> whoſe Violence of Grief had long ago ſubſided, and left only a gentle Senſibility in her Soul, that but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it for new Impreſſions, having found ſome Difficulty in proſecuting her Deſign of returning to <hi>Troy</hi> on the appointed Day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to lay aſide all Thoughts of ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enterpriſe, and began to liſten favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Vows of <hi>Diomede:</hi> This young Warrior, whoſe Heart the Sight of her in <hi>Troy</hi> had enflamed, made Uſe of all the pleaſing Arts with which the God of Love inſpires his Votaries, to engage her to return his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſida</hi> at firſt would melt into Tears, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur the Name of <hi>Troy</hi> with a Sigh, and faintly own ſhe had a Lover there who claimed a Right to her Affection. But the gallant Son of <hi>Tydieus</hi> was not ſo repulſed; well did he know the changing Sex, and how weak an Obſtacle an abſent Lover was; to thoſe faint Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he oppoſed his Royal Birth, his Fame in Arms, his never-dying Paſſion, flattering her Ambition with the Hopes of making her his Queen, and her Vanity with an Aſſurance that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0430500503:87"/>
ſhe only could have ſubdued his Heart. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to her the certain Deſtruction that hung over <hi>Troy,</hi> and the little Probability there was of her being happy with a Lover of that devoted City.</p>
               <p>The ungrateful <hi>Creſſida,</hi> influenced by theſe ſelfiſh Motives, forgot, or did not regard, her Vows of everlaſting Faith to <hi>Troilus,</hi> and charmed with the Perſon, Valour, and exalted Dignity of her new Adorer, yielded, at length, to his Sollicitations; nor was the inſulting <hi>Greek</hi> ſatisfied with thus triumphing in ſecret over his unhappy Rival: A rich Jewel which <hi>Troilus</hi> had given to <hi>Creſſida</hi> at parting, and the abandoned Fair had now beſtowed on <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi> he wore upon his Armour in the Battle, as a Trophy of his Victory, and the <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince's Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> ſtill pining with Deſire, and forſaken as he was by <hi>Creſſida,</hi> yet not capable of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her falſe, nouriſhed the fatal Flame that preyed upon his Heart, with vain deluſive Hopes of her return; which though every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Day proved to be ill-grounded, yet fond of the deceit he ſtill hoped on, and, like a drowning Wretch, graſped eagerly at every faint Relief, to avoid that Death which was, notwithſtanding, inevitable.</p>
               <p>Leaning anxiouſly one Day over the Walls of the City, from whence he ſent many a longing Look towards the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp, and breathed Heart-breaking Sighs at the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0430500503:88"/>
of his <hi>Creſſida,</hi> he ſaw a Coat of Mail carried in Triumph before his Brother <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobas,</hi> as he was returning from the Field of Battle.</p>
               <p>This Sight would have had but little Effect on the Heart of the now inglorious Youth, ſunk as he was in the ſoft Lethargy of Love, conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away with fruitleſs Wiſhes, and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with diſappointed Hope, but a Jewel that blazed upon its Sleeve was no ſooner obſerved than it claimed all his Attention; the Shape and Size, recalling to his Mind the Pledge he gave his <hi>Creſſida</hi> at parting. With trembling Impatience, he fixed his eager Eyes upon it, his Heart took the alarm and beat as if it would have left his Breaſt; cold Damps bedewed his ſhivering Limbs, a mortal Paleneſs overſpread his Face; yet ſtill inſatiate of the Sight, he gazed and trembling prayed it might not be what he feared; at length a near Approach put it paſt a doubt that it was the ſame Jewel, that, wet with his Tears, and hallowed by a thouſand tender Invocations he had given his <hi>Creſſida</hi> at the ſad Moment of their parting; thunderſtruck at this Conviction of her Falſhood, wildly he raiſed his haggard Eyes to Heaven, then ſtriking with his Hands his groaning Breaſt, "Oh! <hi>Creſſida,</hi> he cried, where, where is now thy Faith?"</p>
               <p>Fixed, for a while, he ſtood in ſilent ſad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; then ſuddenly, looking up he demanded of ſome of the Soldiers, whoſe Armour that was which his Brother <hi>Deiphobas</hi> had won; they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0430500503:89"/>
replied, it was <hi>Diomedes.</hi> Grief giving way to Fury at the Sound of that deteſted Name, he ran tranſported with a Deſire of Vengeance to his Palace; there, arming himſelf with a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Haſte, he ruſhed into the Field, and, with loud Cries, called upon <hi>Diomede</hi>; ſeeking his Rival amidſt the thickeſt ranks of his Foes, madly he raged about the hoſtile Field, provoking Death, and ſacrificing whole Hecatombs of ſlaughtered <hi>Greeks</hi> to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; Rage and Deſpair rekindling all his martial Heat, ſent him each Day with more than mortal Courage to the Fight.</p>
               <p>Pale <hi>Greece</hi> with horror beheld the matchleſs Chief thinning their Ranks, and driving whole Squadrons before his conquering Sword, but <hi>Diomede</hi> the partial Gods denied to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Rivals alike in Glory as in Love, they often met, oft fought, but neither van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. The Son of <hi>Tideus</hi> was reſerved by Fate to meet a more ignoble End at Home, and <hi>Troilus</hi> could only fall by the reſiſtleſs Force of <hi>Achilles.</hi>

               <p>The Story of this Play is partly taken from <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Poem of <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Creſſida,</hi> and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0430500503:93"/>
partly from an old Story Book, called <hi>The three Deſtructions of</hi> Troy.</p>
               <p>The firſt furniſhed <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> with the Love Plot, and the ſecond with all the Incidents that relate to the War.</p>
               <p>This Play has been ſeverely cenſured on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Faults of its Plot (if that can be called a Plot which is only a Succeſſion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, without Order, Connexion, or any Dependance upon each other) as well as the Inequality of the Manners the Poet has given to his Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Loves of <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Creſſida</hi> are, in all the Circumſtances, exactly copied from <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>; but theſe Circumſtances are intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the reſt of the Play, and produce no Event worthy our Attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Creſſida</hi> give Name to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, and, by Conſequence, are the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Perſons in it; yet <hi>Troilus</hi> is left alive, and <hi>Creſſida,</hi> too ſcandalous a Character to draw our Pity, does not ſatisfy that Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her Crimes raiſe in us by her Death, but eſcaping Puniſhment, leaves the Play without a Moral, and abſolutely deficient in poetical Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Manners of theſe two Perſons, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ought to eſcape the general Charge of Inequality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0430500503:94"/>
                  <hi>Troilus,</hi> who is drawn exactly after <hi>Chaucer,</hi> is every where conſiſtent with his Character of a brave Soldier, and a paſſionate and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lover.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Creſſida</hi>'s firſt and ſecond Appearance we may eaſily gueſs what her future Conduct will be; the deep Art with which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals her Paſſion for <hi>Troilus,</hi> her looſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with her Uncle, her free Coquettry with the Prince, and her eaſy yielding to his Addreſſes, prepare us for her Falſhood in the ſucceeding Part of the Play, and all together make up the Character of a compleat Jilt: Her not being puniſhed is indeed an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fault, and brings the greateſt Imputation imaginable upon <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Judgment, who could introduce ſo vicious a Perſon in a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, and leave her without the due Reward of her Crimes.</p>
               <p>The Character of <hi>Creſſida</hi> is much more conſiſtent in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> than <hi>Chaucer</hi>; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repreſents her wiſe, humble, and modeſt, nicely ſenſible of Fame, fond of her Country, not eaſily ſuſceptible of Love, hard to be won, and rather betrayed than yielding to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of her Lover.</p>
               <p>With all theſe amiable Qualities to engage our Eſteem and thoſe alleviating Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that attended her Fall with <hi>Troilus,</hi> we cannot, without Surprize, ſee her ſo ſoon changing her Love, violating her Vows, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0430500503:95"/>
baſely proſtituting her Honour to <hi>Diomede.</hi> The inequality of Manners here is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable; but <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> in drawing her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter has avoided falling into the ſame Fault by copying <hi>Chaucer</hi> too cloſely, and <hi>Creſſida,</hi> throughout the Play, is always equal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with herſelf.</p>
               <p>That the old Story Book, called <hi>The three Deſtructions of</hi> Troy, furniſhed <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> with the other Part of the Plot, is plain from ſeveral of the Incidents being exactly copied from thence: Thus he makes <hi>Achilles</hi> to be in Love with <hi>Polyxena</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Priam,</hi> and this Paſſion to be the Cauſe of his refuſing to fight againſt the <hi>Trojans</hi>; and <hi>Hector</hi> to be cowardly killed by <hi>Achilles,</hi> as he was intent on ſpoiling a <hi>Greek</hi> of his Golden Armour, which he had eagerly ſought after in the Battle.</p>
               <p>This Circumſtance, however, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has altered greatly for the worſe: The Story ſays, that <hi>Hector</hi> having ſlain <hi>Patroclus</hi> and performed many wonderful Acts of Valour, ſatisfied with the Slaughters of the Day, was going to quit the Field, when happening to ſee a <hi>Greek</hi> with a compleat Suit of Golden Armour on, his Avarice was awakened and he reſolved not to quit the Battle till he had gained this rich Prize; accordingly he aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Greek,</hi> took him Priſoner, and to lead him more eaſily out of the Throng, caſt his Shield behind him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0430500503:96"/>
                  <hi>Achilles,</hi> whom the Death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> had brought into the Field, burning with a Deſire of Revenge on <hi>Hector,</hi> haſtened to ſeize him at this Diſadvantage, and gave him a Blow with his Spear which killed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes <hi>Hector,</hi> in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, eager to win this Suit of Armour; but after he has ſlain the <hi>Greek</hi> who owned it, he diſarms himſelf in the Field of Battle, and <hi>Achilles</hi> and his Myrmidons coming up, they all ſurround him, fall upon him and kill him.</p>
               <p>Thus has <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> made <hi>Achilles</hi> a greater Coward than the old Story Writer; for in the latter he only takes Advantage of his Enemy's Shield being thrown behind him to give him a Wound; but <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes him employ all his Myrmidons to kill one Man, and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and calling for Mercy.</p>
               <p>The Abſurdity of <hi>Hector</hi>'s unarming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Field of Battle, with all his Foes about him, in order to facilitate this wonderful Enterprize, is too groſs to need any Remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hector</hi>'s challenging any of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes to ſingle Combat, in Honour of their Ladies Beauty, is a Circumſtance borrowed from the Story Book, but ſurely very injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly. The following Meſſage from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of <hi>Troy,</hi> a City almoſt ruined by a War of nine Years Continuance, can hardly be read without a Smile.</p>

                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> begins with telling the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes that, in <hi>Troy,</hi> they have a Prince called <hi>Hector,</hi> and that <hi>Priam</hi> is his Father, as if the Name and Quality of this redoubted Hero, the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0430500503:98"/>
of the <hi>Trojans</hi> and the Terror of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> could be unknown to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> in this Paſſage, contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as Common-ſenſe; for we find afterwards, that they acknowledged the Valour of <hi>Hector</hi> to be ſo great that none but <hi>Achilles</hi> was thought an equal Match for him, and <hi>Ajax</hi> was urged to accept the Challenge, in order to raiſe the Jealouſy of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> alſo tells them, that their Champion is grown ruſty during the dull and long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Truce; yet, in the foregoing Scene, the <hi>Trojan</hi> Heroes are repreſented returning from the Battle, and, after that, we find no mention of a Truce, or any Interval allowed to make it be ſuppoſed there had been one: How then comes it that <hi>Aeneas</hi> here ſpeaks of a Truce? But theſe Blunders are very frequent in <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poet likewiſe, following the old Story Writer, makes <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Ajax</hi> Couſin-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; but in the Play, <hi>Ajax,</hi> as it would ſeem, knows nothing of the Matter till he is told of it, firſt by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Hector</hi>; and then, when the Combat is ended, the two Heroes Embrace, and 'tis nothing but Couſin and Couſin, at every Word.</p>
               <p>The Story tells us, that <hi>Achilles</hi> had a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deſire to ſee <hi>Hector</hi> unarmed; <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0430500503:99"/>
makes uſe of this Thought, <hi>Achilles</hi> ſays, in the Play, to his Friend,
<q>
                     <l>— — I have a Woman's Longing,</l>
                     <l>An Appetite that I am ſick withal,</l>
                     <l>To ſee great <hi>Hector</hi> in the Weeds of Peace.</l>
                  </q>
The Converſation of theſe two Heroes, when they meet, which conſiſts of mutual Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, doubtleſs gave <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> the Hint for that characteriſtic Diſcourſe they hold together in the Play.</p>
               <p>Tho' <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> conſulted this Book for Part of his Plot, yet, in drawing the Characters of his <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes, I cannot help thinking he had <hi>Homer</hi> in his Eye; and probably ſaw ſome old Tranſlation of that Poet, for there was one in his Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Achilles,</hi> indeed, is a Character of his own Invention, ridiculous and inconſtant to the laſt Degree, Brave, and a Coward; a Fool, yet a deep and accurate Reaſoner: But, in the others, he ſeems to have endeavoured at an Imitation of <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he makes <hi>Diomede</hi> bold and enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> wiſe and artful; <hi>Neſtor</hi> narrative, and ever ready to expatiate on his paſt Exploits; <hi>Therſites</hi> cowardly, ſatyrical, witty, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious: In the Interview between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Trojan</hi> Princes, he makes them all ſpeak with great Propriety, and ſuitable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Characters. <hi>Hector,</hi> indeed, by men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0430500503:100"/>
                  <hi>Helen,</hi> ludicrouſly to the injured <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laas,</hi> who had given him a free and ſoldier-like Greeting, diſcovers, in that Inſtance, neither the Manners of a Prince or Warrior; but this is only a Slip; for his Diſcourſe, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after it, is quite agreeable to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>The Silence of <hi>Troilus</hi> in this Scene is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully imagined. The Poet makes this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Prince attend <hi>Hector</hi> to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Tents, whither he is invited only with a Deſign of ſeeing his beloved <hi>Creſſida</hi>; but his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards the Enemies of his Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heightened by the Conſideration of their having deprived him of his Miſtreſs, he is incapable of mixing in the Converſation, or even of returning the Civilities of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes; he ſtands at a Diſtance, penſive, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, wholly abſorb'd in melancholly Reflections. The Grief of this young Lover is finely mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> in that ſhort Queſtion to <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> pointing him out.</p>
               <q>What <hi>Trojan</hi> is that ſame that looks ſo heavy?</q>
               <p>However ridiculous, inconſiſtent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to general Opinion, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has drawn the Character of <hi>Achilles</hi> in this Play; yet, in the following Lines he muſt have had <hi>Homer</hi> in his View. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Army is almoſt rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Trojans,</hi> the Commanders in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Conſternation, when <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> enters, and thus reaſſures them:
<q>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0430500503:101"/>
                     <l>Oh Courage, Courage, Princes! great <hi>Achilles</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Is arming, weeping, curſing, vowing Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance!</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Patroclus'</hi> Wounds have rous'd his drouſy Blood.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Achilles</hi> is made of ſo much Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that, vanquiſhed as they were, and flying from the Field, they no ſooner heard that <hi>Achilles</hi> is arming, and coming to join them, than their Courage is reanimated; they renew the Fight, and Victory declares for them. Only <hi>Homer</hi> could have furniſhed <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> with this Thought, nor with an Idea of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Grief for the Death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> which in two Lines he has ſo pathetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. The old Story which, in many Places he has faithfully copied, is abſolutely ſilent here.</p>
               <p>The Speech of <hi>Calchas</hi> to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, demanding their <hi>Trojan</hi> Priſoner <hi>Antenor</hi> to be exchanged for his Daughter, <hi>Creſſida,</hi> is almoſt literally taken from <hi>Chaucer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Character of <hi>Pandarus,</hi> alſo, is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from him, but much heightened by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>: Part of the Converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pandarus</hi> and his Niece is copied exactly from <hi>Chaucer.</hi>

               <p>THE Action of this Play begins with <hi>Bolingbroke</hi>'s appealing the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> on an Accuſation of High Treaſon: The King, after having in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to reconcile them, permits them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of that Time, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Conteſt with their Swords.</p>
               <p>On the Day appointed, the King and his Nobles being ſeated in the Liſts, the two Champions appear in Armour, and the King, ſuddenly throwing down his Warder, forbids the Combat, and pronounces a Sentence of Baniſhment on both; but with this Difference, that <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> ſhould remain in Exile during ten Years, four of which he afterwards remits, at the Interceſſion of his Father <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0430500503:103"/>
but the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> he commands, on Pain of Death, never to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> dying ſoon after, the King ſeizes his Plate, Money and Lands, to furniſh Neceſſaries for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, in which he was then engaged; and, ſetting ſail for <hi>Ireland,</hi> leaves his Kingdom in great Confuſion. The King's injurious Treatment of the baniſhed <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> by thus depriving him of his legal Poſſeſſions, draws great Numbers to that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Party, who being aſſiſted likewiſe by a foreign Force, lands in <hi>England,</hi> and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that his only Motives for returning to his native Country in Arms, were to get his undeſerved Baniſhment repealed; to require the Reſtitution of thoſe Goods of which he had been unjuſtly deprived, and to claim the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> deſcended to him by the Death of his Father; he is joined by all the diſaffected Nobility.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> his Uncle, and Guardian of the Realm in the King's Abſence, having no Forces to oppoſe him, and conſcious of the Wrongs he had ſuffered, remains neuter.</p>
               <p>The King returns, and falling into the Hands of <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> is carried to <hi>London,</hi> prevailed upon to reſign his Crown, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confined in <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Aumarle,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and ſome other Lords, join in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy

to murder the new King at <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Duke of <hi>York</hi> diſcovers it, by means of a Paper he had ſnatched from his Son; and, haſtening to the King, reveals the Plot, and demands Juſtice on his Son; but <hi>Aumarle</hi> had been before him and ſecured his Pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> alarmed at this Conſpiracy, drops ſome Words, which expreſs a Wiſh that ſome one would diſpatch King <hi>Richard</hi>; this being obſerved by <hi>Exton,</hi> he goes to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle, kills the unhappy King, and brings his Body to <hi>Bolingbroke</hi>; which puts an End to the Play.</p>
               <p>Tho' this Play is called, <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Richard <hi>the Second,</hi> yet the Action of it takes in but little more than the two laſt Years of his Reign.</p>

               <p>Thus it ſtands in <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> Page 512.

               <p>Whereupon the Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> a Man both learned, wiſe, and ſtout of Stomach, boldly ſhewed forth his Opinion concerning that Demand, affirming that there was none amongſt them worthy or meet to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſo worthy a Prince as King <hi>Richard</hi> was; whom they had taken for their Sovereign and Liege Lord, for the Space of two and twenty Years and more; and I aſſure you, ſaid he, there is not ſo rank a Traitor, nor ſo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a Thief, nor yet ſo cruel a Murderer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or detained in Priſon for his Offence, but he ſhall be brought before the Juſtice, to hear his Judgment; and wil ye proceed to the Judgment of an anointed King, heari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſay that the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whom ye call King, hath more treſpaſſed to King <hi>Richard</hi> and his Realm, than King <hi>Richard</hi> hath done either to him or us; for it is manifeſt and well known, that the Duke was baniſhed the Realm by King
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0430500503:107"/>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> and his Council, and by the Judgment of his own Father, for the Space of ten Years, for what Cauſe ye know; and yet, without Licence of King <hi>Richard,</hi> he is returned again into the Realm; and, what is worſe, hath taken upon him the Name, Title, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of King; and therefore, I ſay, that you have done manifeſt Wrong to proceed in any Thing againſt King <hi>Richard</hi> without calling him openly to his Anſwer and Defence."</p>
               <p>"As ſoon as the Biſhop had ended this Tale, he was attached by the Earl Marſhal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Ward in the Abbey of <hi>Saint Albans."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> in his Hiſtorical Plays, was a cloſe Copier of the Hiſtories from whence he took them; yet, in <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, there are ſome Deviations and ſome Omiſſions that throw different Lights on the Characters of his Perſons, and tend greatly to miſlead our Judgments in the Opinions we Form of them.</p>
               <p>The Murder of the Duke, of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> Uncle to the King, is one of the Crimes that <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> charges on the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; the King, in many Paſſages of the Play, is ſaid to have commanded it: The old Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> upbraids him with having ſhed the Blood of the great <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi>'s Silence to that Accuſation is not only a tacit Confeſſion of the Guilt, but a Proof that he had nothing to offer in Vindication of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0430500503:108"/>In the Hiſtory it is not abſolutely clear that King <hi>Richard</hi> had any part in the Death of his Uncle; but 'tis certain that the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> was engaged in ſeveral Conſpiracies againſt him, and that the King having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a dangerous One, in which not only his Crown and Dignity but his Life was aimed at, he found himſelf under a Neceſſity of ſeizing his diſloyal Uncle; which he did by a well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived Stratagem at his own Caſtle, and ſent him to <hi>Calais</hi>; where he confeſſed all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and was aſſaſſinated, as ſome Report, by <hi>Richard</hi>'s Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Silence, upon this Head, is very unfavourable to the Character of <hi>Richard,</hi> on whom, by that Means, he draws the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Murderer and Paracide; and yet, in his Misfortunes, he propoſes him as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Compaſſion, and makes Uſe of all his pathetic Powers to melt the Souls of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his Favour.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorians ſay that <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> when in Baniſhment, was invited by the chief No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in <hi>England</hi> to return and force the Crown from <hi>Richard,</hi> whom they judged unworthy to Reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> takes no Notice of this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but makes <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> on his Arrival, declare that he only came to demand a Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Honours and Eſtates he had been
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0430500503:109"/>
unjuſtly deprived of; and the Lords join him upon this Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>In the Hiſtory we are told, that King <hi>Richard,</hi> finding himſelf abandoned by many of his Friends, his <hi>Welſh</hi> Army, on whom he had the greateſt Confidence, diſperſed, and <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> abſolute Maſter of his People's Hearts, retired to <hi>Conway</hi> Caſtle, which he determined to hold as long as it was poſſible; thither the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> came from <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> with Offers of Submiſſion, on his Part, provided the King would pardon what was paſt, repeal his Baniſhment, and reſtore him to all his Rights and Dignities.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard,</hi> being perſuaded to accept of theſe Conditions, and to go to <hi>Rutland</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> falls into an Ambuſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him, and is led Priſoner to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> drops the Circumſtance of the Ambuſh laid for the King, and repreſents <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> confering in a ſubmiſſive Manner with him at <hi>Flint</hi> Caſtle; and the King, upon his Couſin's ſolemn Aſſurance of attempting nothing againſt his Crown and Dignity, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accompanies him to <hi>London,</hi> where, at a meeting of the Parliament, he is depoſed and the Crown offered to <hi>Bolingbroke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Play affords ſeveral other Inſtances in which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Inattention to the Hiſtory is plainly proved; and is therefore the leſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, as the Subject of it is not one entire
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0430500503:110"/>
Action, wrought up with a Variety of beautiful Incidents, which at once delight and inſtruct the Mind; but a Dramatick Narration of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Facts, and a ſucceſſive Series of Actions and Events which are only intereſting as they are true, and only pleaſing as they are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully told.</p>
               <p>The Manner of <hi>Bolingbroke</hi>'s appealing the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Order of the intended Combat, the very Words of the Appellant and Defendant, the Behaviour and Speech of the King on that Occaſion, are exactly copied from <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> as is likewiſe the Appeals of the Lords in the firſt Scene of the fourth Act.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Conduct, throughout the Play, is the ſame as the Hiſtory repreſents it; only <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has aggravated his Zeal to the new-made King, by introducing him ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſolicitous to procure the Death of his Son <hi>Aumarle,</hi> for having engaged in a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt him.</p>
               <p>The Impropriety of making a Father preſs ſo ardently the Execution of a beloved Son, becauſe that Son had joined with a Party that had reſolved to dethrone an Uſurper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the lawful King, is too glaring to need any Animadverſion: But, becauſe there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truly ludicrous in this very tragical Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, I ſhall tranſcribe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aumarle</hi> finding his Father determined to diſcloſe his Treaſon to the new King, haſtens
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0430500503:111"/>
to Court, and, procuring a private Audience; gets a Promiſe of Pardon from the King: While he is cloſetted with him, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> arrives, and loudly demands Admittance.</p>

               <p>That little Fiction which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into this Play, is imagined with his uſual Careleſneſs and Inattention to Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Queen who, more than any other Perſon, is intereſted in every thing that relates
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0430500503:116"/>
to the King her Huſband, is, nevertheleſs, the laſt that hears of the Seizure of her Lord.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Act, ſhe is informed of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbroke</hi>'s Invaſion, and the Diſſaffection of almoſt all the Nobility; and in the fourth, this ſorrowful Queen is introduced in her Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with two Ladies, who preſs her to dance.</p>
               <p>The Gardener and two Workmen enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe retires behind the Trees, in Hopes of learning ſome News of the State from them; nor is ſhe deceived: From them ſhe firſt hears of the Impriſonment and intended Depoſition of the King her Huſband.</p>
               <p>One might be ſurpriſed, perhaps, to hear from a Gardener's Mouth, a beautiful Syſtem of Politics, couched in a cloſe and well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Allegory, drawn from ſuch Images as his Profeſſion furniſhed him with, if the poor Fellow who works under his Directions did not allegorize as well as his Maſter, and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Wonder.</p>

               <p>The Manner of King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Death is differently related by the Hiſtorians. <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> follows <hi>Thomas Walſingham</hi>'s Account of that barbarous Parricide, as quoted by <hi>Holing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi>; how cloſely he has copied the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and even ſome of the Speeches, may be ſeen by comparing the Paſſages as they ſtand in the Hiſtorian and Poet.</p>
               <p>"One Writer, ſays <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> Page 517, which ſeemeth to have great Knowledge of King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Doings, ſaith, That King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſitting one Day at his Table, are ſighing, ſaid, Have I no faithful Friend which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me of him whoſe Life will be my Death, and whoſe Death will be the Preſervation of my Life.</p>
               <p>This Saying was much noted of them which were preſent, and eſpecially of one called Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Exton.</hi> This Knight incontinently departed from the Court, with eight ſtrong Perſons in his Company, and came to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> commanding the Eſquire that was accuſtomed to ſerve and take the Aſſay before King <hi>Richard,</hi> to do ſo no more, ſaying, Let him eat now, for he ſhall not long eat.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> ſat down to Dinner, and was ſerved without Curteſy or Aſſay; whereupon much marvelling at the ſudden Change, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0430500503:118"/>
of the Eſquire why he did not his Duty? Sir, ſaid he, I am otherwiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Exton,</hi> which is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from King <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When King <hi>Richard</hi> heard that Word, he took the Carving Knife in his Hand, and ſtruck the Eſquire on the Head, ſaying, The Devil take <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and thee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and with that Word Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> entered the Chamber well armed, with eight tall Men likewiſe armed, every one of them having a Bill in his Hand. King <hi>Richard</hi> perceiving this, put the Table from him, and ſtepping to the foremoſt Man, wrung the Bill out of his Hands, and ſo valiantly defended himſelf that he ſlew four of thoſe that thus came to aſſail him. Sir <hi>Pierce,</hi> being half diſmayed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, leaped into the Chair where King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> was wont to ſit, while the other four Perſons fought with him, and chaſed him about the Chamber; and, in Concluſion, as King <hi>Richard</hi> traverſed his Ground from one Side of the Chamber to another, and coming by the Chair where Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> ſtood, he was felled with a Stroke of a Poll-ax, which Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> gave him upon the Head; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with rid him out of Life, without giving him Reſpite once to call to God for Mercy of his paſt Offences.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Exton,</hi> after he had thus ſlain him, wept right bitterly, as one ſtricken with the Prick of a guilty Conſcience
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0430500503:119"/>
for murdering him whom he had ſo long time obeyed as King."</p>

               <p>The King ſends to treat with the Rebels; <hi>Piercy,</hi> being diſpoſed to liſten to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, Commiſſions his Uncle, the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to propoſe Terms to the King.</p>

                  <hi>Worceſter,</hi> out of an Opinion that <hi>Henry</hi> could never be thoroughly reconciled to them, and would take an other Opportunity to be revenged, treacherouſly conceals the King's favourable Offers, and tells <hi>Piercy</hi> that he is reſolved to fight.</p>
               <p>Then follows the Battle, in which, the brave <hi>Piercy</hi> is ſlain by the wild Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> The King's Party is victorious; the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Worceſter</hi> being made Priſoner, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, and the King, dividing his Forces, ſends one Part, under the Command of his ſecond Son, to meet the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> at <hi>York</hi>; and himſelf and the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> march againſt the Rebel <hi>Glendower</hi> and the Earl of <hi>March.</hi>

               <p>The Tranſactions contained in this Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Drama, are comprized in the Space of ten Months.

                  <hi>Shrewſbury</hi>; which Engagement happened the 21ſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1403.</p>

                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has copied <hi>Holingſhed</hi> very cloſely, as well in the Hiſtorical Facts as the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Perſons; <hi>Piercy</hi>'s and <hi>Glendower</hi>'s, are indeed greatly heightened, but both with wonderful Propriety and Beauty. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodical Part of the Drama, which is made up of the extravagant Sallies of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the inimitable Humour of <hi>Falſtaff,</hi> is entirely of his own Invention. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> tho' drawn after the Hiſtorians, is conſiderably improved by <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>; and through the Veil of his Vices and Irregularities, we ſee a Dawn of Greatneſs and Virtue, that promiſes the future Splendor of his Life and Reign.</p>

               <p>THE Tranſactions compriſed in this Hiſtorical Play, commence about the latter End of the firſt, and terminate in the eighth Year of this King's Reign, when he married the Princeſs <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and put an End to the Differences betwixt <hi>England</hi> and that Crown.</p>
               <p>The Siege and taking of <hi>Harfleur,</hi> the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> the Peace concluded between King <hi>Henry</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, with the Marriage of the former to the Princeſs of <hi>France,</hi> are the principal Actions of this Play, and are taken from <hi>Holingſhed</hi>'s Chronicle, after whom the Characters are likewiſe drawn, with very little Variation.</p>

Which the <hi>French</hi> Gloſſers expound to be the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> and that this Law was made by King <hi>Pharamond</hi>; whereas yet their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors affirme, that the Land <hi>Salike</hi> is in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> between the Rivers <hi>Elbe</hi> and <hi>Sala,</hi> and that when <hi>Charles</hi> the Great had overcome the <hi>Saxons,</hi> he placed there certain <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> which having in diſdain the diſhoneſt Manners of the <hi>German</hi> Women, made a Law that the Females ſhould not ſucceed to any Inheritance within that Land, which at this Day is called <hi>Meiſen</hi>: So that if this be true, this Law was not made for the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> nor the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> poſſeſſed the Land <hi>Salike,</hi> till four hundred and one and twenty Years after the Death of <hi>Pharamond,</hi> the ſuppoſed Author of this <hi>Salike</hi> Law; for this <hi>Pharamond</hi> deceaſed in the Year 426, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great ſubdued the <hi>Saxons</hi> and placed the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> in thoſe Parts, beyond the River of <hi>Sala,</hi> in the Year 805.</p>

                  </q> To which the King replied: <q>I would not wiſh a Man more here than I have; we are, indeed, in Compariſon to the Enemies, but a few; but if God, of his Clemency, do favour us and our juſt Cauſe (as I truſt he will) we ſhall Speed well enough: But let no Man aſcribe Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to our own Strength and Might, but only to God's Aſſiſtance, to whom, I have
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0430500503:135"/>
no doubt we ſhall worthily have Cauſe to give thanks therefore; and if ſo be that, for our Offences Sakes, we ſhall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Hands of our Enemies, the leſs Number we be the leſs Damage ſhall the Realm of <hi>England</hi> ſuſtain. <bibl>

               <p>This Paſſage is thus improved by <hi>Shakeſpear:</hi> The Earl of <hi>Weſtmourland</hi> having been to take a View of the Enemies Forces, as they were drawn up in Order of Battle, alarmed at the Superiority of their Numbers, cries out as the King meets him,

               <p>In the firſt Act of this Play the Dauphin of <hi>France</hi> ſends an inſulting Meſſage to King <hi>Henry</hi> accompanied with a Preſent of Tennis Balls as a Reproach for the wild Sallies of his Youth.</p>
               <p>There is no Foundation either in <hi>Hall</hi> or <hi>Holingſhed</hi> for this Circumſtance, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> indeed took the out-lines of the Dauphin's Character from theſe Hiſtorians who repreſent him to be a light, arrogant, and vain-glorious Prince; but he has painted at full Length what they only drew in Miniture; and by adding, with great Propriety ſome of the Characteriſtic Follies of his Nation, given us a lively and humerous Picture of a Coxcomb Prince.</p>
               <p>The abſurdity of making the Princeſs <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> the only Perſon in the <hi>French</hi> Court, who does not underſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken Notice of: And it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0430500503:137"/>
that the great <hi>Henry</hi> makes but a miſerable Figure as a Lover; no Language can be coarſer than that in which he addreſſes the Princeſs, the firſt Time he ſees her, <hi>Do you like me</hi> Kate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the Dialogue is not without wit, livlineſs, and humour; but ſo utterly void of Propriety that we loſe all Idea of the Dignity of the Perſons who manage it, and, are readier to imagine we hear a common Soldier making love to an aukward Country Girl, than a King of <hi>England</hi> courting a Princeſs of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> it is probable, took the Hint of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Preſent of Tennis Balls from the following old Ballad.</p>

               <p>THE Contention between the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> furniſhes the Incidents which compoſe this Play. The Action begins with King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which was in the twenty third Year of his Reign, and cloſes with the firſt Battle fought at <hi>St. Albans</hi> and won by the <hi>York</hi> Faction, in the thirty third Year of his Reign; ſo that it takes in the Hiſtory and Tranſactions of ten Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has copied <hi>Holingſhed</hi> pretty cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughout this whole Play, except in his Relation of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s Death.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0430500503:153"/>
The Chronicle tells us, that King <hi>Henry,</hi> to ſatisfy the Nobility and People, who hated this Favourite, condemned him to Baniſhment during the Space of five Years. In his Paſſage to <hi>France</hi> he was taken by a Ship of War belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Conſtable of the <hi>Tower</hi>; the Captain of which Ship carried him into <hi>Dover</hi> Road, and there ſtruck off his Head on the Side of a Cock-boat.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> he is taken by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pyrates on the Coaſt of <hi>Kent,</hi> who, notwithſtanding the large Ranſom he offers them, reſolve to murder him: One of them, in the Courſe of his Converſation with the Duke, tells him, that his Name is <hi>Walter Whitmore</hi>; and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſtart, aſks him, if he is frighted at Death, to which <hi>Suffolk</hi> replied.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thy Name affrights me, in whoſe Sound is Death,</l>
                  <l>A cunning Man did calculate my Birth,</l>
                  <l>And told me that by <hi>Walter</hi> I ſhould die.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This Circumſtance is not to be found, either in <hi>Hall</hi> or <hi>Holingſhed</hi>; and as it has greatly the Air of Fiction, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> probably bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it from the ſame Tale that furniſhed him with the Loves of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and the Queen, on which ſeveral paſſionate Scenes in this Play, as well as the former, are Built.</p>

               <head>THE THIRD PART OF King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth.</head>
               <p>THE Scene of this Play opens juſt after the Battle of <hi>St. Albans,</hi> wherein the <hi>York</hi> Faction was Victorious, and cloſes with the Murder of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth and the Birth of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> afterwards King <hi>Edward</hi> the fifth; ſo that this Hiſtory takes in the ſpace of ſixteen Years. The Facts are all extracted from <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> and moſt of the Incidents very cloſely copied. The ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle between the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> for the Crown being the Subject purſued in this Drama, every Scene almoſt preſents us with a new Battle, a flying Army, or the Carnage of a bloody Field; where the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

Conquerors unſated with the Slaughters of the Fight, ſacrifice their defenceleſs Enemies to the Fury of their Revenge, and exult over them, when dying, with a Cruelty truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has given the ſame inconſiſtent and improper Manners to all the chief Perſons in this Play; the brave old Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the gallant <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, afterwards King, the heroic <hi>Warwick,</hi> whom the Poet ſo often ſtyles the Maker and Subduer of Kings, are all Murderers; at once the Heroes and the Villains of the Scene, equally exciting our Praiſe and Deteſtation. The Poet, in order to diſplay this predominant Paſſion, Cruelty, in Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters where it is leſt expected to be found, the Heroe and the Prince, has not ſcrupled to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate ſometimes the Truth of Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Chronicles ſay, that the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who pretended to the Crown, was killed in the Battle of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and being found dead in the Field by the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> he cut off his Head and preſented it to the Queen of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, who was in Perſon at this Battle. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes him to be taken Priſoner by the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Clifford,</hi> who bring him to the Queen and aſk what ſhe would have done to him: To which ſhe replies,</p>

               <head>THE LIFE and DEATH OF King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third.</head>
               <p>THIS Tragedy, tho' it is called the Life and Death of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, takes in, at moſt, but the laſt eight Years of his Time. The Scene opens with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which happened in the beginning of the Year 1477, and cloſes with the Death of <hi>Richard</hi> at <hi>Boſworth</hi> Field; which Battle was fought on the 22d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year 1485.</p>
               <p>The hiſtorical Facts are all taken from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſhed,</hi> and the Characters all cloſely copied from that Author; that of <hi>Richard</hi> the third
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0430500503:162"/>
has been cenſured as monſtrous, the Picture of a Fiend and not a Man; and too exquiſitely wicked to be repreſented on the Stage. 'Tis certain however, that <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has not ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the Vices and Cruelty of this Prince; he paints him ſuch as Hiſtory has tranſmitted him to us; and if his Character ſhocks us more in the Scene than the Story, 'tis becauſe the Colours of the Poet are more lively, his Expreſſion ſtronger, and the Lights he ſhews him in more diverſified; but the Subject in both is the ſame. The qualities of his Mind and Perſon are thus ſummed up by <hi>Holingſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"As he was ſmall and little of Stature, ſo was he of Body greatly deformed, the one Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der higher than the other, his Face was ſmall, but his Countenance cruel, and ſuch that the firſt Aſpect a Man would judge it to ſmell and favour of Malice, Fraud and Deceit; when he ſtood muſing, he would bite and chaw his nether Lip; as who ſaid, that his fierce Nature always chafed, ſtirred and was ever unquiet: beſide, that the Dagger which he wore, he would (when he ſtudied) with his Hand pluck up and down in the Sheath to the midſt, never drawing it fullie out. He was of a ready, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and quick Wit, wielie to feire, and apt to diſſemble: He had a proud Mind, and an arrogant Stomach, the which accompanied him even to his Death, rather chooſing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſame by dint of Sword, than, being forſaken and left helpleſs of his unfaithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, to preſerve by cowardlie Flight, ſuch a frail and uncertain Life, which by Malice,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0430500503:163"/>
Sickneſs, or condigne Puniſhment, was like ſhortly to come to confuſion."</p>
               <p>This Character is the very ſame with that drawn of him by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>; but the latter is made more ſtriking by the wonderful Propriety of the Manners and Sentiments he every where, throughout the Play, attributes to him. If <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> is in any Inſtance to be blamed for keeping too cloſe to the Hiſtorian, it is for dignifying the laſt Moments of this bloody Tyrant with ſuch ſhining Proofs of Fortitude and Valour, as, notwithſtanding the Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we conceived at his cruelties, muſt force from us an involuntary Applauſe. The Hiſtory tells us he fought bravely in that Battle which decided his Fate, and, overpowered as he was by Numbers, diſdained to ſave his Life by Flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> improves this into the following noble Deſcription, which has indeed this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Effect, that our hatred of the Tyrant is wholly loſt in our Admiration of the Heroe.</p>

               <p>There are ſeveral of <hi>Shakeſpears</hi> hiſtorical Plays which take in a greater Compaſs of Time than this, but none in which the abſurdity of crowding the Events of many Years into a Repreſentation of three Hours, is made ſo glaring. This, no doubt, is occaſioned by the very unartful Diſpoſition of the Incidents which, though made up of diſtant Events, follow one another without the leaſt Preparation, without the Intervention of an Act, or Change of Scene, to give the Spectator's Imagination room to cheat itſelf agreeably, by ſupplying that Diſtance of Time neceſſary for the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Probability to the Story. To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this one need only conſider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the firſt Part of the fourth Act, where <hi>Richard,</hi> for the firſt Time, enters as King, his Nephew Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being ſtill alive: He declares his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of them to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by whoſe Aſſiſtance he had uſurped the Crown,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0430500503:165"/>
and preſſes him to give Conſent to their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The Duke demands a Minute's Leiſure to conſider of his Propoſal, and goes out; <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> immediately aſks his Page, if he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend any Perſon to him that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a Murder for Reward; the Page names <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> and goes to fetch him; King <hi>Richard</hi> then addreſſing himſelf to one of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſays:

The Cardinal verily was put in moſt Blame for this Scruple now caſt into the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for the Hate he bore to the Emperor, becauſe he would not grant to him the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> for the which he was a Suiter; and therefore, he did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the King of <hi>England</hi> to join in Friendſhip with the <hi>French</hi> King, but alſo ſought a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce betwixt the King and Queen, that the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0430500503:179"/>
King might have in Marriage the Dutcheſs of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> Siſter to the <hi>French</hi> King; and (as ſome have thought) he travelled in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the <hi>French</hi> King at <hi>Amiens:</hi> But the Dutcheſs would not give Ear thereunto.</p>
               <p>But howſoever it came about, that the King was thus troubled in Conſcience concerning his Marriage, this followed, that, like a wiſe and ſage Prince, to have the Doubt clearly removed, he called together the beſt learned of the Realm, which were of ſeveral Opinions. Wherefore, he thought to know the Truth by indifferent Judges, leſt, peradventure the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and other alſo in favour of the Queen, would ſay, that his own Subjects were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Judges in this Behalf; and therefore, he wrote his Cauſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and likewiſe ſent to all the Univerſities in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and to the great Clerks of all Chriſtendome, to know their Opinions, and deſired the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſend into his Realm a Legate, which ſhould be indifferent and of great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Judgment, to hear the Cauſe debated. At whoſe Requeſt the whole Conſiſtory of the College of <hi>Rome</hi> ſent thither <hi>Laurence Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> a Prieſt Cardinal, a Man of great Wit and Experience, which was ſent hither before, in the tenth Year of this King, and with him was joined in Commiſſion the Cardinal of <hi>York</hi> and Legate of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Cardinal came to <hi>London</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> and did intimate both to the King and Queen the Cauſe of his coming, which being known,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0430500503:180"/>
great Talk was had thereof. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſent for the famous Doctors of both the Univerſities, to <hi>Lambeth</hi>; and there were every Day Diſputations and Communings of this Matter. And becauſe the King meant nothing but uprightly therein, and knew that the Queen was ſomething wedded to her own Opinion, and wiſhed that ſhe ſhould do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Counſel, he bad her chooſe the beſt Clerks of his Realme to be of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and licenced them to do the beſt on her Part that they could, according to the Truth. Then ſhe elected <hi>William Warham,</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Weſt,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elie,</hi> Doctors of the Laws; and <hi>John Fiſher,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and <hi>Henry Standiſh,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Doctors of Divinity; and many other Doctors and well-learned Men, which, for Surety, like Men of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, defended her Cauſe as far as Learning might maintain and hold it up.</p>
               <p>About this time was received into Favour <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> whoſe Service he uſed in Matters of great Secrecy and Weight, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in the room of Dr. <hi>Pace,</hi> the which being continually abroad in Ambaſſages, and the ſame oftentimes not much neceſſary, by the Cardinal's Appointment, at length he took ſuch Grief therewith that he fell out of his right Wits.</p>
               <p>The Place where the Cardinals ſhould ſit to hear the Cauſe of Matrimony betwixt the King and Queen, was at the <hi>Black Friars</hi> in <hi>London</hi>;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0430500503:181"/>
where, in the great Hall was Preparation made of Seats, Tables, and other Furniture, according to ſuch a ſolemn Seſſion and royal Appearance. The Court was platted in Tables and Benches in manner of a Conſiſtory, one Seat raiſed higher for the Judges to ſit in; then, as it were in the midſt of the ſaid Judges, aloft above them three Degrees high, was a Cloth of State hanged, with a Chair royal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame, wherein ſat the King; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him, ſome Diſtance from him, ſat the Queen; and under the Judges Feet ſat the Scribes and other Officers; the chief Scribe was Dr. <hi>Stevens,</hi> and the Caller of the Court was one <hi>Cooke</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, before the King and Judges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Court, ſat the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Warham,</hi> and all the other Biſhops. Then ſtood at both Ends within, the Councellors learned in the ſpiritual Laws, as well the King's as the Queen's. The Doctors of Law for the King had their convenient Rooms: Thus was the Court furniſhed. The Judges commanded Silence whilſt their Commiſſion was read, both to the Court and to the People aſſembled; that done the Scribes commanded the Crier to call the King by the Name of, <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>come into the Court,</hi> &amp;c. with that the King anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Here:</hi> Then called he the Queen, by the Name of, Kathrine <hi>Queen of</hi> England, <hi>come into the Court,</hi> &amp;c. who made no Anſwer, but roſe out of her Chair.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0430500503:182"/>And becauſe ſhe could not come directly to the King for the Diſtance ſevered between them, ſhe went about by the Court, and came to the King, kneeling down at his Feet; to whom ſhe ſaid in effect as followeth: Sir, I deſire you to do me Juſtice and Right, and take ſome Pity on me, for I am a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Stranger born out of your Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, having here no indifferent Counccl, and leſs Aſſurance of Friendſhip. Alas, Sir, what have I offended you, or what Occaſion of Diſpleaſure have I ſhewed you, intending thus to put me from you after this Sort. I take God to my Judge, I have been to you a true and humble Wife, ever conformable to your Will, and Pleaſure, that never contraried or gainſaid any thing thereof; and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contented with all things wherein you had any Delight, whether little or much, without Grudge or Diſpleaſure; I loved, for your ſake, all them whom you loved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were my Friends or Enemies. I have been your Wife theſe twenty Years and more, and you have had by me diverſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if there be any juſt Cauſe that you can allege againſt me, either of Diſhoneſty, or Matter lawful to put me from you, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to depart, to my Shame and Rebuke; and if there be none, then I pray you to let me have Juſtice at your Hand. The King your Father was, in his time, of excellent Wit; and the King of <hi>Spain, Ferdinand</hi> my Father, was reckoned one of the wiſeſt Princes that raigned in <hi>Spain</hi> many Years before; it is not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0430500503:183"/>
to be doubted, but that they had gathered as wiſe Councellors unto them of every Realme, as to their Wiſdom they thought meet, who deemed the Marriage between you and me good and lawful: Wherefore, I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to ſpare me, untill I may know what Councell my Friends in <hi>Spain</hi> will advertiſe me to take; and if you will not, then your Pleaſure be fulfilled. With that ſhe roſe up, making a low Curteſie to the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thence.</p>
               <p>The King being advertiſed that ſhe was ready to go out of the Houſe, commanded the Crier to call her again, who called her by theſe Words: Cathrine <hi>Queen of England come into the Court</hi>; with that (quoth Mr. <hi>Griffith)</hi> Madam you be called again. On on, quoth ſhe, it maketh no Matter I will not tarry, go on your wayes, and thus ſhe departed without any farther Anſwer at that Time, or any other, and never would appear after in any Court. The King, perceiving ſhe was departed, ſaid theſe Words in Effect: For as much, quoth he, as the Queen is gone, I will, in her Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence declare to you all, that ſhe hath been to me as true, as obedient, and as conformable a Wife, as I could Wiſh or Deſire. She hath all the virtuous Qualities that ought to be in a Woman of her Dignity, or in any other of a baſer Eſtate; ſhe is alſo ſurely a noble Woman born, her Conditions will well declare the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0430500503:184"/>With that, quoth <hi>Wolſey</hi> the Cardinal, Sir I moſt humbly require your Highneſs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, before all this Audience whether I have been the chief and firſt Mover of this Matter unto your Majeſty or no, for I am greatly ſuſpected herein. My Lord Cardinal, quoth the King, I can well excuſe you in this Matter; Marrie, quoth he, you have rather been againſt me, in the tempting hereof than a Setter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Mover of the ſame. The ſpecial Cauſe that moved me unto this Matter, was a certain Scrupuloſity that pricked my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, upon ceriain Words ſpoken at a Time, when it was by the Biſhop of <hi>Baion</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, who had been hither ſent upon the debating of a Marriage between our Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> ſecond Son to the King of <hi>France.</hi> Upon the Reſolution and Determination whereof, he deſired Reſpite to advertiſe the King his Maſter thereof, whether our Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhould legitimate in Reſpect of this my Marriage with this Woman, being ſometime my Brother's Wife; which Words, once conceived within the ſecret Bottom of my Conſcience, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſuch a ſcrupulous Doubt, that my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was incontinently accombred, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diſquieted; whereby I thought myſelf to be greatly in Danger of God's Indignation, which appeared to be (as to me ſeemed) the rather for that he fent us no iſſue Male, and all ſuch Iſſues Male as my ſaid Wife had by me, died incontinent after they came into the World, ſo I doubted the great Diſpleaſure of God in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0430500503:185"/>
that behalf. Thus my Conſcience being toſſed in the Waves of a ſcrupulous Mind, and partly Deſpair to have any other Iſſue than I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by this Lady now my Wife, it behoved me further to conſider the State of this Realm, and the Danger it ſtood in for lack of a Prince to ſucceed me: I thought it good, in Releaſe of the weighty Burthen of my weak Conſcience, and alſo the quiet Eſtate of this worthy Realm, to attempt the Law therein, whether I may lawfully take another Wife, by whom God may ſend me more Iſſue, in caſe this my firſt Copulation was not good, without any carnal Concupiſcence, and not for any Diſpleaſure or miſliking of the Queen's Perſon and Age, with whom I would be as well contented to continue, if our Marriage may ſtand with the Laws of God, as with any alive. In this Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſteth all this Doubt, that we go about now to trie, by the Learning, Wiſdom and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of you our Prelates and Paſtors of all this our Realm and Dominions, now here aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for that Purpoſe, to whoſe Conſcience and Learning I have committed the Charge and Judgment, according to the which I will (God willing) be right well content to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit myſelf, and, for my Part obey the ſame. Wherein after that I perceived my Conſcience ſo doubtfull, I moved it in Confeſſion to you my Lord of <hi>Lincoln</hi> then Ghoſtly Father, and for ſo much as then you yourſelf were in ſome Doubt, you moved me to aſk the Councel of all theſe my Lords; whereupon I moved you my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> firſt, to have your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, in as much as you were Metropolitan,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0430500503:186"/>
to put this Matter in Queſtion, and ſo I did of all you my Lords, to which you granted under your Seals, here to be ſhewed. That is truth quoth the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> After that the King roſe up; and the Court was adjourned untill another Day.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted, that the Queen in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the whole Court, moſt greveouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the Cardinal of Untruth, Deceit, Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and Malice, which had ſowne Diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt her and the King her Huſband; and therefore openly proteſted, that ſhe did utterly abhore, refuſe and forſake ſuch a Judge, as was not only a moſt malicious Enemy to her, but alſo a manifeſt Adverſarie to all Right and Juſtice, and therewith did ſhe appeal unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> committing her whole Cauſe to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. But notwithſtanding this Appeal, the Legates ſat weekly, and every Day were Argument on both Parts, and Proofes alleged for the underſtanding of the Caſe, and ſtill they ſtayed if they could by any Means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Queen to call back her Appeal; which ſhe utterly refuſed to do. The King would gladly have had an end in this Matter; but when the Legates drave Time, and determined upon no certain Point, he conceived a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that this was done of Purpoſe, that their doings might draw to none Effect or Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion."</p>

The King's Councel alledged the Matrimony not to be lawful at the Beginning, becauſe of the carnal Copulation had between Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and the Queen. This Matter was very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently touched on that Side; and, to prove it, they alledged many Reaſons and Similitudes of Truth; and being anſwered negatively again on the other Side, it ſeemed that all their former Allegations were doubtful to be tried, and that no Man knew the Truth, and thus this Court paſſed from Seſſions to Seſſions, and Day to Day, till at certain of their Seſſions the King ſent the two Cardinals to the Queen (who was then in <hi>Bridwell</hi>) to perſuade with her by their Wiſdoms, and to adviſe her to ſurrender the whole Matter into the King's Hands, by her own Conſent and Will, which ſhould be much better to her Honour, than to ſtand to the Tryal of Law, and thereby to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, which ſhould ſeem much to her Diſhonour.</p>

At whoſe coming, quoth ſhe, what is your Pleaſure with me? If it pleaſe your Grace, quoth Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> to go into your Privy Chamber we will ſhew the Cauſe of our coming. My Lord, quoth ſhe, if ye have any Thing to ſay, ſpeak it openly before all theſe Folk, for I fear nothing you can ſay againſt me, but that I would have all the World ſhould hear and ſee it, and therefore ſpeak your Mind. Then began the Cardinal to ſpeak to her in <hi>Latine.</hi> Nay, good my Lord, quoth ſhe, ſpeak to me in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

               <p>Forſooth (quoth the Cardinal) good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, if it pleaſe you, we come both to know your Mind, how you are diſpoſed to do in this Matter between the King and you, and alſo to declare ſecretely our Opinions and Councels unto you, which we do only for very Zeal and Obedience we bear unto your Grace. My Lord, quoth ſhe, I thank you for your good Will, but to make you Anſwer in your Requeſt I cannot ſo ſuddenly; for I was ſet among my Maids at Work, thinking full little of any ſuch Matter, wherein there needeth a longer Deliberation, and a better Head than mine to make Anſwer, for I need Councell in this Call which touches me ſo near, and for any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

or Friendſhip that I can find in <hi>England,</hi> they are not for my Profit, what think you my Lords, will any <hi>Engliſhman</hi> Councell me, or be Friend to me againſt the King's Pleaſure, that is his Subject? Nay forſooth, and as for Councell, in whom I will put my truſt, they be not here, they be in <hi>Spain,</hi> in my own Country. And my Lords, I am a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lacking Wit, to anſwer to any ſuch Noble Perſons of Wiſdom as you be, in ſo weighty a Matter, therefore I pray you be good to me poor Woman, deſtitute of Friends, here in a foreign Region, and your Councell alſo I will be glad to hear. And therewith ſhe took the Cardinal by the Hand, and led him into her privy Chamber with the other Cardinal, where they tarried a Seaſon talking with the Queen, which Communication ended, they departed to the King, making to him Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Talk. Thus this Caſe went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from Court to Court, till it came to Judgment, ſo that every one expected that Judgment would be given the next Day. At which Day the King came thither, and ſet him. down in a Chair, within a Door in the End of the Gallery (which opened directly againſt the Judgment Seat, to hear the Judgment given, at which Time all their Proceedings were read in <hi>Latine.</hi>

The Caſe is very doubtful, and alſo the Party Defendant will make no Anſwer here but doth rather Appeal from us, ſuppoſing that we be not indifferent, wherefore I will adjourn this Court for this Time, according to the Order of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And with that the Court was diſſolved and no more done. This potracting of the Concluſion of the Matter, King <hi>Henry</hi> took very diſpleaſantly. Then Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> took his Leave of the King and Nobility and returned to <hi>Rome."</hi>

                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes the King firſt ſee <hi>Anna Bullen</hi> at a Banquet given by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey.</hi> There ſeems to be ſome little Abſurdity in this Incident; for <hi>Anna Bullen</hi> being, as the Lord Chamberlain afterwards tells the King, one of the Queen's Attendants, it can hardly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he never ſaw her before. This Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet is at large deſcribed by <hi>Holingſhed. Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> follows him cloſely in ſeveral of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as well as the Diſcourſe that paſſed between the King and ſome of the Perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>"On a time, ſays <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> Page 921, the King came ſuddenly thither in a Maſk, with a Dozen Maſkers, all in Garments like Shepherds, made of fine Cloth of Gold, and Crimſon Sattin paned, and Caps of the ſame, with Vizards of good Phyſnomie, their Hair and Beards either of fine Gold-wire, Silk, or Black Silk, having ſixteen Torch-bearers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Drums, and other Perſons with their Vizards, all cloathed in Sattin of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and before his entering into the Hall, he came by Water to the Water-gate without Noiſe, where were laid diverſe Chambers and Guns charged with Shot, and at his Landing they were ſhot off, which made ſuch a Rumble in the Air that it was like Thunder, it made all the Noblemen, Ladies, and Gentlemen to muſe what it ſhould mean, coming ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſitting quiet at a ſolemn Banquet after
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0430500503:211"/>
this Sort. Firſt, you ſhall underſtand that the Tables were ſet in the Chamber of Preſence, juſt covered, and the Lord Cardinal ſitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Cloth of State, there having all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice alone, and was there ſet a Lady with a Nobleman, or a Gentleman and a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man throughout all the Tables in the Chamber on the one Side, which were made and joined as it were but one Table, all which order and deviſe was done by the Lord <hi>Sanders,</hi> then Lord Chamberlain to the King, and by Sir <hi>Henry Guildford,</hi> Comptroller of the King's Houſe. Then immediately after the Great Chamberlain, and the ſaid Comptroller, ſent to look what it ſhould mean (as though they knew nothing of the Matter) who looking out of the Windows into the <hi>Thames,</hi> returned again and ſhewed him, that it ſeemed they were Noblemen and Strangers that arrived at his Bridge, coming as Ambaſſadors from ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, With that, quoth the Cardinal, I deſire you becauſe you can ſpeak <hi>French,</hi> to take the Pains to go into the Hall, there to receive them according to their Eſtates, and to conduct them into this Chamber, where they ſhall ſee us, and all theſe noble Perſonages, being merry at our Banquet deſiring them to ſit down with us, and to take part of our Fare. Then went down incontinently into the Hall, where they were received with twenty new Torches, and conveyed them up into the Chamber with ſuch a noiſe of Drums and Flutes, as ſeldom had been heard the like. At their entring into the Chamber two and two together, they went directly towards the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0430500503:212"/>
where he ſat, and ſaluted him reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. To whom the Lord Chamberlain for them ſaid; Sir, for as much as they be Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and can not ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to declare unto you, that having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this triumphant Banquet, where was aſſembled ſuch a Number of excellent Dames, they could do no leſs under ſupport of your Grace, but to repair hither, to view as well their incomparable Beauty, as for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them at Mum-chance, and then to Dance with them; and, Sir, they require of your Grace, Licence to accompliſh the ſaid Cauſe of their coming. To whom the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſaid, he was very well content they ſhould do ſo. Then went the Maſkers, and firſt ſaluted all the Dames, and returned to the moſt worthy, and there opened their great Cup of Gold filled with Crowns and other Pieces of Gold, to whom they ſet certain Pieces of Gold to caſt at. Thus peruſing all the Ladies and Gentlewomen, to ſome they loſt, and of ſome they won; and marking after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all the Ladies, they returned to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with great Reverence, powring down all the Gold ſo left in their Cup, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Hundred Crowns. At all quoth the Cardinal, and ſo caſt the Dice and wone them, whereat was made a great Noiſe and Joy. Then, quoth the Cardinal to the Lord Chamberlain. I pray you, that you would ſhew them, that me ſeemeth there ſhould be a Nobleman amongſt them, who is more meet to occupy this Seat and Place than I am, to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0430500503:213"/>
whom I would moſt gladly ſurrender the ſame according to my Duty, if I knew him.</p>
               <p>Then ſpake the Lord Chamberlain to them in <hi>French,</hi> and they rounding him in the Ear, the Chamberlain ſaid unto my Lord Cardinal, Sir quoth he, they confeſs, that among them there is ſuch a noble Perſonage, whom if your Grace can point him out from the reſt, he is content to diſcloſe himſelf, and accept your Place. With that the Cardinal taking good Adviſement among them, at the laſt quoth he, me ſeemeth the Gentleman with the black Beard, ſhould be he, and with that roſe out of his Chair, and offered the ſame to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the black Beard with his Cap in his Hand. The Perſon to whom he offered the Chair was Sir <hi>Edward Nevill,</hi> a comely Knight, that much more reſembled the King's Perſon in that Maſk than any other. The King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Cardinal ſo deceived, could not forbear laughing, but pulling down his Viſar and Mr. <hi>Nevill</hi>'s alſo, and daſhed out ſuch a pleaſant Countenance and Cheere, that all the noble Eſtates there aſſembled perceiving the King to be there among them, rejoiced very much."</p>

               <p>This Play, as the learned Mr. <hi>Upton</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his critical Obſervations on <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear,</hi> might be properly called the Fall of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> if the Action had cloſed with the Marriage of the King to <hi>Anna Bullen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This haughty Churchman is indeed ſhewn in the Heighth of his Power and Favour with the King, from whence he falls by a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of unhappy Circumſtances, which bring on his total Diſgrace, and at laſt his Death: But even in this Caſe, the Action could not be conſidered as one and entire, while Queen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi>'s Sufferings make ſo large a Part of it, and which, from the Dignity of her Character, and the great and ſudden Reverſe of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, cannot, with any Propriety, form only a ſubordinate Incident in a Play, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the Fall of a much leſs conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than herſelf.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> has a higher Claim to give a Title to the Tragedy than <hi>Wolſey,</hi> ſince her Quality and Misfortunes are both ſuperior to his. She, like him, is ſhewn in the Sunſhine
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0430500503:223"/>
of her Fortune, a Queen, and happy in the Affections of her Sovereign and Huſbund, as may be concluded from King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Speech to her at her Entrance into the Council-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

               </q>
               <p>After this, we ſee her deſpiſed, neglected, baniſhed from his Bed, the Name and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Wife taken from her, divorced, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen'd, and ſhutting up all her Sorrows in Death. The Fate of this Queen, or that of Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> each ſingly afforded a Subject for Tragedy. <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> by blending them in the ſame Piece, has deſtroyed the Unity of his Fable, divided our Attention between them; and, by adding many other inconnected Incidents, all foreign to his Deſign, has given us an irregular hiſtorical Drama, inſtead of a finiſhed Tragedy.</p>
               <p>In all that related to Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> he has exactly followed hiſtorical Truth; and his Character, as drawn by the Queen and <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith,</hi> with all its Lights and Shades, is, as the Reader may perceive, cloſely copied from that Hiſtorian.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> in the Play, being told by <hi>Griffith,</hi> her Gentleman Uſher, that the Cardinal is dead, replies,

                     <l>And yet with Charity; he was a Man</l>

                     <l>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.</l>
                     <l>His Promiſes were, as he then was, mighty;</l>
                     <l>But his Performance, as he now is, nothing.</l>
                     <l>Of his own Body he was ill, and gave</l>

               </p>
               <p>"This Cardinal was of a great Stomach, for he counted himſelf equal with Princes; and by crafty Suggeſtion got into his Hands innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Treaſure; he forced little on Simony, and was not pitiful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>THE TALE of</hi> Geneura: From the <hi>Italian</hi> of <hi>Lodovico Arioſto,</hi> in the Fifth Book of his <hi>Orlando Furioſo.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE noble <hi>Rilando</hi> ſailing to <hi>England,</hi> whither he was ſent on an Embaſſy by the Emperor <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> a violent Storm aroſe, which continuing two Days and Nights, drove him, at laſt, on the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland:</hi> His Fleet arriving ſafe, he ordered his Retinue to meet him at <hi>Berwick,</hi> himſelf, without any Attendants, ſtruck into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Foreſt of <hi>Caledonia,</hi> not without a Hope of meeting with ſome Adventure worthy his Courage and Virtue.</p>
               <p>While he was pleaſing himſelf with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, ſometimes riding, and ſometimes walking a ſlow Pace leading his Horſe, Night drew on, and he now began to think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to go in queſt of a Lodging. Perceiving an Abbey at ſome Diſtance, he remounted his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0430500503:229"/>
Horſe and rode up to it. The Abbot and his Monks, ſeeing a Stranger of a noble Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at their Gate, came out, and with great Civility invited him to paſs the Night there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rinaldo</hi> gratefully accepted their Offer; and being conducted to a Chamber, and an elegant Repaſt ſerved to the Table, as ſoon as he had ſatisfied the Cravings of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite made eager by Travel and long Faſting, he enquired of the good Fathers what noble Exploits in Arms had been lately performed in their Neighbourhood, and whether a Warrior might hope to find any Occaſions there of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalizing his Valour?</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, replied the Abbot, that many great and wonderful Adventures have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved in this Foreſt, but as the Place, ſo are the Actions, obſcure, and buried in Oblivion: Hovever, if Honour be your Purſuit, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time affords you a fit Opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; the Danger, indeed, is great, but if you ſucceed eternal Fame will be your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The young and beautiful <hi>Geneura,</hi> the Daughter of our King, is accuſed by a Knight named <hi>Lurcanio,</hi> of having violated her Chaſtity; and it being provided by our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Laws, that all Damſels, of what Rank ſoever, who are publickly charged with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence, ſhall ſuffer the Puniſhment of Fire, unleſs a Champion be found who will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their Defence, and fight with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0430500503:230"/>
                  <hi>Geneura,</hi> in Conſequence of this Law, has been adjudged to die, and only a Month's Space allowed her to procure a Defender of her Life and Honour. The King, anxious for his Daughter's Safety, but more for her Reputation, has cauſed it to be proclaimed throughout his Dominions, that by whatever Perſon (provided his Birth he not abſolutely baſe) his Daughter ſhall be delivered from the Danger that threatens her, to him ſhall the Princeſs be given in Marriage, with a Portion ſuitable to her high Rank and Quality.</p>
               <p>This Enterprize, noble Stranger, is worthy your Youth, your Courage, and Generoſity: The Law of Arms requires all true Knights to undertake the Defence of injured and oppreſſed Ladies; and, ſurely, a fairer than <hi>Geneura</hi> is not to be found from one Extremity of the Globe to the other; nor, if common Opinion may be relied on, a chaſter.</p>
               <p>And is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Rinaldo</hi> after a little Pauſe, that this fair Princeſs is condemned to die for having generouſly rewarded the Paſſion of a faithful Lover? Curſed be the Makers of ſo hard a Law; more curſed they that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by it. For me it matters not whether <hi>Geneura</hi> be juſtly or unjuſtly accuſed; what has been imputed to her as a Crime, were I her Judge, ſhe ſhould be applauded for, had ſhe taken care to have avoided Diſcovery; and, as it is, I am reſolved to defy her Accuſer to Combat, and, I truſt, ſhall be able to deliver
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0430500503:231"/>
her from the unjuſt and cruel Puniſhment ſhe has been doomed to.</p>
               <p>The Abbot and Monks, overjoyed that they had procured a Champion for their Princeſs, laviſhed a thouſand Praiſes on <hi>Rinaldo</hi> for his generous Deſign; and he, full of Impatience to begin the glorious Enterprize, being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Hoſts with a Guide, ſet out early the next Morning for the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Court, leaving the good Fathers charmed with his Courage and Gallantry, and offering up repeated Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Heaven for his Succeſs.</p>
               <p>As they were purſuing their Journey through Bye-roads, for the greater Expedition, a Cry, as of ſome Perſon in Diſtreſs, rouzed all their Attention. Inſtantly <hi>Rinaldo</hi> clapped Spurs to his Horſe, and bending his Courſe towards the Place from whence the Noiſe proceeded, he came to a deep Valley, ſurrounded with Trees, through the Branches of which he perceived a young Maid ſtruggling to free herſelf from the Hands of two Ruffians, who were attempting to murder her. Tranſported with Rage at this Sight, the generous <hi>Rinaldo</hi> flew to the Relief of the diſtreſſed Damſel; his Appearance ſo terrified the intended Murderers, that they left their Prey, and fled with the utmoſt Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Mean time the Maid recovered from her Fright, thanked her Deliverer with a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Joy and Gratitude, and was beginning to acquaint him with the Story of her Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0430500503:232"/>
when he, who had not alighted, being eager to purſue his Journey, commanded his Guide to take her up behind him; and as they travelled, having at leiſure obſerved her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Behaviour, he was ſo much ſtruck with the Beauty of the one, and the ſoft and gentle Modeſty of the other, that his Curioſity was awakened, and he became ſolicitous to know by what means ſhe had been brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo cruel a Situation.</p>
               <p>His Requeſt being inforced with kind Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of future Protection, the Damſel, with a low Voice, and Eyes caſt down in a graceful Confuſion, began in this manner:</p>
               <p>Since you, my generous Deliverer, have commanded me to relate my Misfortunes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to hear a Tale more full of Horror, an Act of greater Villainy and Baſeneſs than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Thebes,</hi> or <hi>Argos</hi> ever knew. Ah! 'tis no Wonder that our barren Clime is curſt with a long Winter's ceaſeleſs Rage, <hi>Phoebus</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to ſhine upon a Land where ſuch inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Crimes are perpetrated; Deeds black as Darkneſs, and fit to be covered with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Night; unhappy as I am, I bore but too great a Share in thoſe I am going to relate.</p>
               <p>From my earlieſt Youth I was brought up in the Palace with the Daughter of our King, honoured with a near Attendance on her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and happy in the Poſſeſſion of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Eſteem. Long might I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed this delightful Situation; but Love (ah!
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0430500503:233"/>
that ever ſo ſweet a Paſſion ſhould prove the Source of ſo much Miſery) Love interrupted my Tranquillity, ſubjected my whole Soul, and gave me up to Guilt, to Shame, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing Penitence.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Alban</hi> was the Subject of my Virgin Wiſhes, my Youth and Perſon pleaſed him; ſkilled as he was in every deluding Art by which the falſe and the deſigning Part of his Sex betray the unexperienced of ours, is it any Wonder that I was deceived? Fond of believing what I wiſhed, and judging of his Paſſion by my own, I yielded to his Deſires, and vainly hoped this Sacrifice of my Honour would ſecure to me for ever, the Poſſeſſion of his Heart.</p>
               <p>Our guilty Commerce laſted ſome Months, during which time I always received his Viſits in a Summer Apartment belonging to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs my Miſtreſs, into which, as it was now the moſt rigid Seaſon of the Year, ſhe never entered; and being alſo in a Part of the Palace little frequented, and the Windows oppoſite to ſome ruined Houſes, my Lover could come thither unobſerved, and by the Help of a ſilken Cord which I let down to him, eaſily aſcend the Chamber.</p>
               <p>All Senſe of Virtue being now ſubdued, and my whole Soul ſunk in a dear lethargick Dream of Pleaſure, I never once ſuſpected, that as my Paſſion increaſed, that of my Lover was decreaſing: Ah! my too violent Love favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0430500503:234"/>
his Deceit, or ſoon I might have perceived that he feigned much, and loved but little.</p>
               <p>At length, notwithſtanding my Prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, his Coldneſs became viſible; I ſigh'd, I wept, I reproach'd, alas! how unavailing are all Endeavours to revive a decaying Paſſion, ſatiated by Poſſeſſion, and conſtant only to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polyneſſo,</hi> ſo was my faithleſs Lover named, languiſhed in ſecret for the bright <hi>Geneura,</hi> my royal Miſtreſs, I know not if this Paſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced before my Ruin was compleated, or whether her more powerful Charms was the Cauſe of his Infidelity; but certain it is, that relying on the fervent Love I bore him, he made no Scruple to confeſs his Flame, even to me, urging me by all the Arguments his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind could ſuggeſt, to move the Heart of <hi>Geneura</hi> in his Favour.</p>
               <p>Ah! my Lord judge, if this cruel Man was dear to me, ever ſolicitous to procure his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and ſoothed by his Aſſurances that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was the prevailing Motive of his Addreſs to the Princeſs, in which, if he ſucceeded, he vowed to keep me ſtill his, and that I ſhould Share with her his Perſon and his Heart, I conſented to all he propoſed; and following his Inſtructions, took all Opportunities of praiſing him to my Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Alban</hi> was the conſtant Subject of my Diſcourſe; I extolled his Valour his Generoſity, his illuſtrious Birth, the manly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0430500503:235"/>
Graces of his Perſon, the mingled Sweetneſs and Dignity of his Manners; the charming Theme tranſported me out of myſelf; with eager Pleaſure I ran over all his Virtues, dwelt with Delight on every imputed Charm; ſcarce could my Tongue keep Pace with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of my loveſick Fancy, fond of the dear Indulgence of talking in a perſonated Character of him I loved.</p>
               <p>But when, in Compliance with his Injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ventured to inſinuate his Paſſion for her, then only did I ſpeak with Coldneſs and Reſtraint; ſlowly the unwilling Words found way, checked by my riſing Sighs, and prefaced by my Bluſhes. My Emotions could not have been hid from an intereſted Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the Princeſs was not only wholly indifferent to <hi>Polyneſſo,</hi> but indulged a ſecret Paſſion for the all-accompliſhed <hi>Ariodant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This young Knight, an <hi>Italian</hi> by Birth, came with his Brother to the Court of <hi>Scotland,</hi> either in purſuit of Glory, or to tranſact ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Buſineſs with the King. To the Graces of his Form, than which Nature never made one more lovely, is added a Mind fraught with whatever is moſt great and excellent in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; his Valour never yet found an equal in our Land; his is the Prize at every Tourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his the foremoſt Honours of the Field: in Peace the Ornament of our Court, in War the Defender of our Country.</p>
               <p>The King, to whom he had indeared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a thouſand Services, loaded him with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0430500503:236"/>
Riches and Honours, and gave him the firſt Employments in the Kingdom; the Hill of <hi>Sicily</hi> burns not with fiercer Fires, nor glows <hi>Veſuvius</hi> with more ardent Flames, than thoſe which the bright Eyes of our Princeſs kindled in the Heart of <hi>Ariodant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſoon diſcovered that <hi>Geneura</hi> approved, encouraged and returned his Paſſion; and being, as you may eaſily imagine, not greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at this Obſtacle to the Deſires of my faithleſs Duke, I acquainted him with all I knew, and from the apparent Impoſſibility of his ever ſucceeding in his Attempt, drew Arguments to induce him to give it over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polyneſſo,</hi> naturally haughty and vindictive, could not bear with Patience, the Thoughts of being rejected for a Stranger. Every way, as he conceived, his Inferior; Diſdain, Shame, Rage, by turns, engroſſed his Soul, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thence every ſofter Paſſion; his Love for <hi>Geneura</hi> was now converted to the moſt obſtinate Hatred, and he reſolved to accompliſh her ruin by the blackeſt Treaſon that ever was conceived in the Heart of Man.</p>
               <p>His Scheme of Revenge concerted, in which I, alas! tho' ignorantly, was to act the chiefeſt Part, he one Day accoſted me with an Air more tender and affectionate than uſual.</p>
               <p>My dear <hi>Dalinda,</hi> ſaid he, generous and kind as you have been to me, well may you think yourſelf injured by my Inconſtancy,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0430500503:237"/>
but as Trees, you know, when cropt by the Pruner's Hand, ſhoot out into freſh luxuriant Branches, ſo on the Root of my Paſſion for <hi>Geneura,</hi> young Buds of Fondneſs riſe and all the ripening Fruit is yours.</p>
               <p>Nor do I languiſh ſo much for the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Geneura</hi>'s Beauties, as I Diſdain to be thus rejected and contemned; and, leſt this Grief ſhould prey too forcibly on my Heart, do thou, my Fair, indulge my ſick Fancy with a kind Deceit, and in the Dreſs of that too haughty Charmer, receive me to thy Arms.</p>
               <p>When the Princeſs is retired to Bed, put on her Robes, adorn thee with her richeſt Jewels, with her Girdle bind thy ſwelling Boſom, let her Coronet glitter on thy beauteous Brow, and beneath it let thy Hair deſcend in graceful Curls like hers; then, in her borrowed Form, attend my coming at the well-known Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; thus ſhall my Pride be gratified, and my capricious Fancy pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Without reflecting on the inſidious Purport of this Requeſt, I promiſed to comply with it; and, for many ſucceſſive Nights, received him in the Habit he preſcribed. Having thus wrought me to his Wiſh, his wicked Arts were next played off on <hi>Ariodant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the Duke had any Knowledge of his Paſſion for the Princeſs, he had lived in ſtrict Friendſhip with this young Knight, and thence
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0430500503:238"/>took Occaſion to reproach him with the Breach of it, by preſuming to addreſs the Princeſs.</p>
               <p>In you, ſaid he, I little expected a Rival as well on Account of your Attachment to me, as the Improbability of your ſucceeding in your Attempt; for you are not now to be told of the mutual Paſſion that has long joined <hi>Geneura</hi>'s Heart and mine, nor that I intend ſoon to aſk the King's Conſent to eſpouſe her; why then do you fondly thruſt yourſelf between me and my almoſt certain Happineſs? how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently ſhould I act were I in your Place?</p>
               <p>Why this to me, my Lord? replied <hi>Ariodant</hi> haſtily, 'tis you who have betrayed our Friendſhip, you have commenced my Rival, not I yours; I claim a prior Right in fair <hi>Geneura,</hi> as have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loved her firſt, and have been happy enough to inſpire her with an equal Flame; this you might have perceived, had you not been blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Obſtinacy; ſince then the Laws of Friendſhip demand one of us to yield, be yours the Taſk as having leſs Right to perſiſt, and leſs Hope of ſucceeding than myſelf. In Riches indeed you are my Superior; but the King's Favour is equally ſhared betwixt us, and in the Heart of <hi>Geneura</hi> the Advantage is wholly mine.</p>
               <p>What Errors does not Love Occaſion? repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke; each thinks himſelf the happy Object of her Wiſhes, and yet 'tis certain that only one is loved: Thus then let us decide the Conteſt; he who can give the moſt certain
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0430500503:239"/>
Proofs of her Affection ſhall be left by the other in the free and undiſturbed Poſſeſſion of it; but, firſt, let us bind ourſelves by the moſt ſolemn Oaths not to diſcloſe each others Secret.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Ariodant,</hi> with trembling Impatience agreed, and the artful Duke went on in this Manner:</p>
               <p>'Tis now almoſt five Months ſince the beautious <hi>Geneura,</hi> rewarded my ardent Love with the Poſſeſſion of her Perſon; oft has the conſcious Queen of Night lent me her ſhades to guide me to my Charmer and ſeen me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in her Arms.</p>
               <p>'Tis falſe, by Heaven, interrupted <hi>Ariodant,</hi> tranſported with Rage; not that cold Queen, whoſe Name thou haſt profaned, is chaſter than my <hi>Geneura:</hi> Traitor, with my good Sword I'll prove thou lyeſt, take Notice I defy thee to mortal Combat, and will with thy deareſt Blood, waſh away the Slanders thou haſt thrown upon my Princeſs.</p>
               <p>Moderate your Rage, ſaid the calm Villain, I mean to give you Proofs, convincing Proofs, of what I have ſaid, your own Eyes ſhall be Witneſſes of the Favours I enjoy.</p>
               <p>The unhappy <hi>Ariodant,</hi> pale, trembling, and loſt in ſpeechleſs Grief and Horror at thoſe fatal Words, ſtood for ſome Moments fixed in racking Thought, like the ſad Statue of Deſpair; then raiſing his Eyes, overflowing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0430500503:240"/>
with Tears, to Heaven, and paſſionately ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his groaning Breaſt, and can it be, he cried, that my <hi>Geneura,</hi> that Princeſs whom I loved, whom I adored, with ſuch pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence as mortals pay to Deities, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Prey of looſe Deſires, and give her faithful <hi>Ariodant</hi> to Death? Oh! 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though a God ſpoke it, I ſhould ſay t'were falſe.</p>
               <p>Incredulous Man, ſaid <hi>Polyneſſo,</hi> have I not offered to give thee Proofs that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied? thy Eyes ſhall ſee the Favours ſhe beſtows on me.</p>
               <p>I take you at your Word, reſumed <hi>Ariodant</hi> impatiently, give me to behold her Guilt and I am ſatisfyed.</p>
               <p>To morrow Night, ſaid the Duke, I have an Appointment with her; I will conduct you to a Place from whence, unperceived, you yourſelf ſhall behold me aſcend her Chamber Window, and judge by the Reception ſhe gives me, if I am happy in her Favour.</p>
               <p>To this the almoſt diſtracted <hi>Ariodant</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and, at the appointed Time, followed the Duke to thoſe ruined Houſes I mentioned before, and there ſtood concealed from View: Being doubtful of <hi>Polyneſſo</hi>'s Intentions he had ordered his Brother <hi>Lurcanio</hi> to arm and go with him, directing him to ſtay at a convenient Diſtance ſo as to be within call if any Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery was offered him, but not in Sight of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ura</hi>'s
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0430500503:241"/>
Window: for he would have no Witneſs of her Guilt but himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Duke, having placed <hi>Ariodant</hi> moſt conveniently for his Purpoſe, advanced and gave the uſual Sign; unhappy as I am I heard, and eagerly obeyed the welcome Summons, adorned in <hi>Geneura</hi>'s richeſt Robes, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Veil that Princeſſes only wear, I appeared at the Window and threw the Silken Ladder over to my Lover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lurcanio</hi> either fearing for his Brother's Safety, or deſirous of prying into his Secrets, quitted his appointed Station and unperceived by him, walked ſoftly forward till he came within ten Paces of <hi>Ariodant,</hi> and now my faithleſs Duke was ſeen by both the Brothers (though known only to <hi>Ariodant)</hi> to aſcend the Ladder and gain the Chamber Window, at which I met him with a tender Embrace, wandering over his Lips and Eyes with eager Kiſſes.</p>
               <p>This Sight ſo enflamed the Soul of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odant</hi> with Rage and Grief, that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Sword, and fixing the Pummel of it in the Ground, he was going to ruſh with all his Force upon the Point, had he not been prevented by <hi>Lurcanio,</hi> who perceiving his raſh Deſign ſprang to him in an Inſtant, and having thrown aſide the fatal Inſtrument of Death, received his ſinking Brother in his Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0430500503:242"/>Ah miſerable Brother! ſaid <hi>Lurcanio,</hi> by what wild Fury art thou poſſeſt to fall thus meanly for a Woman? Now curſed, forever curſed be all the Kind, may they all periſh, in one wide Ruin, blown as they are, like Clouds, with every blaſt of Wind; and this fair Miſchief that has betrayed thee, let us deviſe ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Vengeance for her: Let not thy noble Life be ſacrificed to her Falſhood; her's is the Crime, be her's the Puniſhment; proclaim her Guilt aloud, accuſe her to the King, my Eyes as well as thine have ſeen her Infamy, and, with my Sword I'll make good thy Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariodant,</hi> whoſe Soul was torn with various and conflicting Paſſions, ſmiled gloomily at the Mention of Revenge; a while he ſeemed to bury every Thought of Grief and of Deſpair in that one Hope of ſacrificing the guilty Lover to his Wrongs: But alas! the cureleſs Wound remained behind; <hi>Geneura,</hi> baſe as ſhe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he loved with ſuch unceaſing Fondneſs, that wholly unable to endure her Loſs, and dreading no Hell like that within his Boſom, once more he reſolved to die.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Lurcanio,</hi> however he diſſembled his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and went Home with him at his Requeſt; but early the next Morning he departed, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Traces behind him from whence it might be gathered to what Place he was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lurcanio,</hi> dreading the fatal Effects of his Deſpair, was pierced to his inmoſt Soul at the

News of his Flight; the King and the whole Court took Part in his Affliction; no Methods were left untried to diſcover where he was; Meſſengers were ſent in ſearch of him to the utmoſt Extremities of the Kingdom: But all returned without any Succeſs.</p>
               <p>At length a Peaſant came to Court, and at his Requeſt was introduced to the Princeſs, who informed her, that as he was travelling to the City he met <hi>Ariodant</hi>; that this unhappy Knight obliged him to follow him and be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an Act he was going to perform; that obeying his Orders they journeyed on together till they came to a ſteep Rock, that hung pendant over the Sea, fronting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Iſland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariodant,</hi> ſaid the Peaſant, aſcending this Rock commanded me to obſerve well what he did, to give you an Account of it, and tell you his laſt Words; which were, that he had ſeen too much: Then ſpringing furiouſly from the top of the Rock, he precipitated himſelf into the Sea. Terrified at the dreadful Sight, I haſtily turned back, and travelled hither to bring you the fatal News.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Geneura,</hi> overwhelmed with Grief and Amazement for the Death of her Lover, and the ſtrange Meſſage he had ſent her, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf to the moſt violent Exceſſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; ſhe beat her beautious Boſom, tore her Hair, and in the wildneſs of her Woe, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Times invoked the dear loved Name of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0430500503:244"/>
                  <hi>Ariodant</hi>; repeated the myſterious Words he uttered, and as often called on Death to end her.</p>
               <p>The News of his Death, with the ſad Manner of it, ſpread Grief and Conſternation through the whole City; even the remoteſt Parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> felt and lamented the loſs of their valiant Defender; the King and the whole Court bewailed his loſs with the ſincereſt Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but <hi>Lurcanio,</hi> ſuperior in Grief, as more nearly intereſted in the dear deceaſed, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his unhappy Brother with all the tenderneſs of fraternal Love, and all the warmth of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Revolving in his Mind the fatal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the Window, which had been the Cauſe of his Brother's Diſtraction; the Deſire and Hope of Revenge afforded ſome Relief to the poignancy of his Woe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately bent to ſacrifice the Princeſs to the <hi>Manes</hi> of his <hi>Ariodant,</hi> he preſented himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and Council, and accuſed her of Incontinence, relating all that <hi>Ariodant</hi> and he had ſeen, and the fatal Effects it had upon him; he then reminded the King of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Laws againſt unchaſtity, and loudly demanded Juſtice on the Princeſs.</p>
               <p>Horror and Amazement ſeized the Soul of the unhappy Father; <hi>Geneura</hi> tho' dearer to him than Life, tho' innocent in his Opinion, he has not Power to ſcreen from the Danger that threatens her; the Laws indeed permit
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0430500503:245"/>
the accuſed to have a Champion to fight in her Defence; by whom, if the Proſecuter (who is obliged to maintain by Force of Arms the Truth of his Aſſertion) is worſted, ſhe is declared guiltleſs of the Crimes laid to her Charge.</p>
               <p>To this only Remedy the King has Recourſe, and cauſes it to be proclaimed throughout his Dominions, that if any Knight of noble Birth will undertake the Defence of his Daughter, and by Force of Arms ſhall vanquiſh her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, on him he will beſtow the Princeſs, with a Dower ſuitable to her Quality.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this Proclamation no Knight has yet offered himſelf for the Enterprize, deterred therefrom by the known Valour of <hi>Lurcanio</hi>; the King, no leſs anxious for <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ura</hi>'s Reputation than her Life, cauſed all her Maids to be brought to a Tryal, who with one Voice declared they never were privy to any Intrigue of their royal Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Alarmed at theſe Proceedings, and dreading the Conſequence of a further Scrutiny, I urged the Duke to take ſome Meaſures for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Security, he, with diſſembled Kindneſs, praiſed my Secrecy and Affection, and ſent two Men to conduct me to a Caſtle of his at a great Diſtance from the Court.</p>
               <p>Wholly relying on his Faith, I put myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection of thoſe two Villains, whom the Duke, deſirous of removing for ever the only Perſon who could diſcover his Guilt,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0430500503:246"/>
ordered when they came to a convenient Place to murder me; happily for me Chance conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you that Way; you delivered me from my impending Fate, and while it ſhall pleaſe Heaven to preſerve my unhappy Life, it ſhall be ſpent in grateful Acknowledgments to my Protector.</p>
               <p>This Account of <hi>Geneura</hi>'s Innocence was extreamly welcome to <hi>Rinaldo</hi>; for tho' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in his own Courage he was not without Hopes of delivering her, guilty as ſhe appeared; yet the certainty that he was going to fight in a juſt Cauſe, animated him with double Fires, and gave him almoſt a Confirmation of Victory.</p>
               <p>Now clapping Spurs to his Horſe he rode on with ſuch eager Haſte, that the noble Town of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> ſoon appeared in View. There the Combat was to be performed, the Guards had already ſurrounded the Liſts, the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers Trumpet had ſounded, and the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py King, pale, trembling, and full of eager Anxiety, liſtened with a beating Heart, and fear-checked Wiſhes for an accepting Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Mean time <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> having left the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dalinda</hi> at an Inn, with repeated Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of gaining her Pardon, in caſe he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the Princeſs's Accuſer, advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City-gate: Here he was met by a young Page, who informed him that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Knight, clad all in ſable Armour, was arrived; that he had demanded the Combat with <hi>Lurcanio,</hi> and declared he would die, or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0430500503:247"/>
free the Princeſs from her ignominious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> impatient to unfold the Myſtery, thundered at the City-gates, which being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he rode eagerly to the Liſts; there behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Combatants engaged, he forced his Way through the Preſs, and crying aloud that they ſhould ceaſe the Fight, demanded an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Audience of the King.</p>
               <p>The Marſhals of the Field thereupon parted the two Champions, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conducted to the King; to whom he related the whole Story of <hi>Polyneſſo</hi>'s Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as he had received it from <hi>Dalinda</hi>; adding that he would prove the Truth of it by Force of Arms, and begged he might be allowed to defy the Traitor Duke to ſingle Combat.</p>
               <p>The noble Form of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> but chiefly the pleaſing Purport of his Speech, gained him abſolute Credit with the King. Scarce could the raptur'd Parent reſtrain the wild Exultings of his Joy at this Confirmation of his <hi>Geneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s Innocence; dearer than Life or Empire was ſhe loved by him, and freely would he have ſacrificed both to ſave her Honour: He heſitated therefore not a Moment in permitting the requeſted Combat, but ordered Duke <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſo</hi> to be called.</p>
               <p>He, by his Office of High Conſtable, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordering of the Combat, was riding proudly about the Field, exulting in his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0430500503:248"/>
Treaſon, and anticipating, in his own Mind, the Ruin of the fair and injured <hi>Geneura,</hi> ignorant though he was of the Deſign of this Summons, yet coward Guilt ſuggeſting the worſt he had to fear, with a diſordered Air, and Eyes expreſſive of the various Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that ſtruck his conſcious Soul, he met the reproachful Look of his King, and the fierce Glances of <hi>Rinaldo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That noble Warrior repeating in a few Words the Treaſons he had been guilty of, challenged him to the Field: <hi>Polyneſſo</hi> denied the Accuſation, but accepting the proferred Combat, becauſe he could not avoid it, retired to arm himſelf, while <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> fraught with the pious Prayers and Bleſſings of the King, entered the Liſts, and ordered his Trumpet to ſound.</p>
               <p>At the third Blaſt the Duke appeared, pale Terror and Diſmay were pictured in his Face, his fainting Heart throbbed with the conſcious Pangs of Guilt, and Horrors of impending Fate; confuſed, diſtracted, not knowing what he did, he darted forwards at the Signal given to begin the Fight; but his weak Lance, ill-guided by his trembling hand, fell harmleſs to the Ground.</p>
               <p>Not ſo the great <hi>Rinaldo</hi>; he, with calm Courage, and Brave, yet unaſſuming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, meditated the Wound, and riſing all collected to the Blow, threw his famed Lance with ſuch unerring Skill and Force, that it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0430500503:249"/>
pierced quite through the Armour of <hi>Polyneſſo</hi> and hid its fatal Point within his Side.</p>
               <p>The Traitor fell, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> eagerly diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and approaching him unlaced his Helmet. With faint low Voice he called for Mercy, and thinking to deſerve it, confeſſed unaſked the Wrong he had been guilty of to <hi>Geneura</hi>; then as if Life had been only lent him till he had cleared her Innocence, ſcarce had he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered another Prayer for Mercy, but Death ſuppreſt the coward Supplication, and he lay a breathleſs Coarſe at the Feet of <hi>Rinaldo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The People tranſported with Joy that their Princeſs was not only delivered from Death, but reſtored to her former ſanctity of Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made the Air reſound with their Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rinaldo</hi> being conducted to the King, untied the Beaver of his Helmet, and was immediately known to be that famous Knight of <hi>Italy,</hi> whoſe noble Exploits were noiſed over all the habitable World.</p>
               <p>The King embraced him in a rapture of Joy and Gratitude; the Nobles crouded round the Deliverer of their Princeſs, loaded him with Bleſſings, and ſtrove to exceed each other in Praiſes of his invincible Valour.</p>
               <p>Theſe Congratulations over, all Eyes were turned upon the unknown Knight in black Armour, who had ſo generouſly undertaken
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0430500503:250"/>
the Defence of <hi>Geneura</hi> againſt her Accuſer <hi>Lurcanio</hi>; penſive he ſtood during the Fight between <hi>Polyneſſo</hi> and <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> his Eyes fixed upon the Combatants, with eager Attention he had liſtened to the dying Words of the treacherous Duke, and while the Multitude in loud ſhouts expreſſed their Joy, and the King and Court were paying Honours to the glorious Victor, he ſtood apart from the Throng, abſorbed in Thought, and wholly inſenſible of the Tumult around him.</p>
               <p>The King cauſed him to be conducted to his Preſence, and acknowledging himſelf greatly obliged to his generous Intention, preſſed him to let him know in what manner he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay the Obligation.</p>
               <p>The Knight made no Anſwer, but bowing low, and throwing off his Helmet, the King and Court, with the utmoſt Aſtoniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the lovely Face of <hi>Ariodant</hi>; Wonder and Joy kept them all ſilent for a while; at length the King, recovering from his Surprize, claſp'd the young Warrior to his Breaſt with a tender Embrace:</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, ſaid he, in a Tone of Voice expreſſive of the ſtrongeſt Tranſport, that I behold again my <hi>Ariodant,</hi> the gallant Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of my Dominions, and the brave Champion for my Daughter's Honour? him whom I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented as dead, whom my whole Kingdom mourned for, tell me by what ſtrange yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Chance I now behold thee living, whoſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0430500503:251"/>
Death was ſo confidently affirmed, and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally believed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariodant</hi> knowing the King was acquainted with the whole Story of his Love, replied without Reſerve:</p>
               <p>The Peaſant, my Lord, whom I detained to be a Witneſs of the ſad Effects of my Deſpair, and to bring the News of it to the Princeſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her truly that I caſt myſelf from the Rock into the Sea, but that natural Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance we have all to Death, when near, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may deſpiſe its Terrors at a Diſtance, impelled me, involuntarily, to uſe Meaſures to preſerve a Life which a Moment before I had been ſo deſirous of loſing.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I roſe again upon the Surface of the Waves, I applied myſelf to ſwimming, at which I was very expert, and ſoon reached the neighbouring Shore, faint, weary, and almoſt breathleſs I threw myſelf down amidſt the Ruſhes, and was found in this Condition by an ancient Hermit, whoſe Cell was at a ſmall Diſtance.</p>
               <p>Thither he conducted me, and in a few Days his charitable Cares reſtored me to my Strength; but alas! my Mind was tortur'd ſtill with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Paſſions; Love, Hate, Deſpair, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Thirſt of Vengeance, by Turns poſſeſſed me; in vain I ſought to baniſh the Idea of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neura</hi> from my Soul, it ſtill returned with double Force; nor could her Infidelity, of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0430500503:252"/>
which, miſtaken Wretch that I was, I thought I had ſuch convincing Proofs, weaken the Power of her reſiſtleſs Charms.</p>
               <p>Thus languiſhing, with a cureleſs Wound, I heard the News of her Accuſation by my Brother, and the Danger to which her Life and Honour were expoſed: At that Moment, forgetting the Injuries I had ſuffered, inſenſible to all the Tyes of Conſanguinity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and only ſolicitous for her Safety, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to fight with my Brother in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, pleaſing myſelf with the Thought, that if I did not free her, I ſhould at leſt have the Satisfaction of dying in her Cauſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by proving how much Superior to <hi>Polyneſſo</hi> was my Love, who though favoured as he was by her he wanted Courage to defend her.</p>
               <p>Having provided myſelf with Armour that might effectually conceal me, I came hither full of Fury againſt my Brother, whom I could not but conſider as my worſt Enemy, ſince he was the Accuſer of the ſtill adored <hi>Geneura,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arrival of the brave <hi>Rinaldo</hi> happily prevented the Continuance of a Combat, which muſt have ended in the Death of one Brother, and eternal Remorſe to the other.</p>
               <p>With Joy I behold the Princeſs delivered from the ignominious Death with which ſhe was threatened; but oh! with far more Rapture do I congratulate your Majeſty on this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her Innocence: Happy <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0430500503:253"/>
be at once the Defender of her Life, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of her Honour: As for me I ſought only to preſerve her from Death; and if that was denied me, to have the Satisfaction, at leaſt, of dying in her Defence, by the Hand of a Friend and Brother.</p>
               <p>The King who loved him before for his Virtues, was ſo charmed with this generous Proof of his Paſſion for his Daughter, that he eaſily yielded to the Solicitations of <hi>Rinaldo</hi> and the Noblemen of his Court, to beſtow the Princeſs on ſo faithful a Lover; and endowing her with the Dutchy of <hi>Albania,</hi> which, on <hi>Polyneſſo</hi>'s Deceaſe, reverted to the Crown, he gave her Hand to <hi>Ariodant</hi> in the Preſence of the whole Court, and the Nuptials were ſoon after celebrated with the utmoſt Magnificence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rinaldo</hi> having obtained <hi>Dalinda</hi>'s Pardon, who retired into a Monaſtery, took leave of the King and happy Lovers, and purſued his Voyage to <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The Scheme for ruining the Lady in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, is formed and executed by a rejected Lover, who ſees a Rival, his inferior in Rank and Fortune, preferred before him, and loſes at once the Object of his Wiſhes, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of increaſed Honours, by that Preference. Ambition, and the Deſire of Revenge, are Paſſions ſtrong enough in a Mind not very virtuous, to produce Acts of Baſeneſs and Villainy. <hi>Polyneſſo,</hi> urged by thoſe powerful Incentives, contrives to blacken <hi>Geneura</hi>'s Fame, which produces a Separation between her and her Lover, and prevents a Stranger from marrying this Princeſs, and conſequently enjoying thoſe Honours, he ſo ardently deſired himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0430500503:259"/>Don <hi>John,</hi> in the Play, is a Villain merely through the Love of Villainy, and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a capricious Diſlike to <hi>Claudio,</hi> cloſes eagerly with his Confident's horrid Scheme for breaking off his Marriage with <hi>Hero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prevent the multiplying ſuch outrageouſly wicked, and therefore unnatural Characters, Don <hi>John</hi> himſelf might have been the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of that black Contrivance againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Hero,</hi> and <hi>Borachio,</hi> for the ſake of the thouſand Ducats that was afterwards given him by Don <hi>John,</hi> be induced to execute it: But here we have two Villains equally bad, both governed by the ſame deteſtable Principles, acting upon the ſame Motives, and ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Parity in their Manners, that they are only diſtinguiſhed from each other by their Names.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Borachio</hi> tells Don <hi>John</hi> to go to his Brother, and maintain confidently that <hi>Hero</hi> is a looſe Wanton, Don <hi>John</hi> aſks what Proof he ſhall make of that? "Proof enough, ſays the other, to miſuſe the Prince, vex <hi>Claudio,</hi> undo <hi>Hero,</hi> and kill <hi>Leonato,</hi> look you for any other Iſſue?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claudio</hi> only is the Object of Don <hi>John</hi>'s Hatred, yet the chief Force of rhe intended Injury is to fall on <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leonato</hi> her Father, towards whom he has no Malice; and he is made to engage in this wicked Enterprize, to procure the Ruin and Death of two Perſons he
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0430500503:260"/>
hates not, to give a little Vexation to one he does. Theſe Abſurdities have their Riſe from the injudicious Change of the Characters. The Contrivance to ſlander <hi>Hero</hi> is not leſs ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and this alſo is occaſioned by the Poet's having deviated from the Original to introduce his own wild Conceits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Borachio</hi> tells Don <hi>John,</hi> that he is highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by <hi>Margaret, Hero</hi>'s waiting Woman; that he will perſuade her to dreſs in her Lady's Cloaths, aſſume her Name, and talk to him out of her Chamber-window, all which Don <hi>Pedro</hi> and <hi>Claudio</hi> being Witneſſes of, would effectually convince them that <hi>Hero</hi> was diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Borachio</hi> does not acquaint Don <hi>John,</hi> and through him the Audience, what Colour he will give to this ſtrange Requeſt, in order to induce <hi>Margaret</hi> to grant it: <hi>Margaret</hi> is all along repreſented as faithful to her Miſtreſs; it was not likely ſhe would engage in a Plot that ſeemed to have a Tendency to ruin <hi>Hero</hi>'s Reputation, unleſs ſhe had been impoſed on by ſome very plauſible Pretences, what thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were we are left to gueſs, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo difficult to do, that we muſt reaſonably ſuppoſe the Poet himſelf was as much at a Loſs here as his Readers, and equally incapable of ſolving the difficulty he had raiſed.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Borachio</hi> ſhould be the ſuſpected Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant of <hi>Hero,</hi> is a Circumſtance alſo highly improbable. <hi>Borachio,</hi> a mean Dependant on
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0430500503:261"/>
a Man whoſe Vices had made him the Object of univerſal Hatred and Contempt, a Stranger almoſt in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and, as well on Account of the Meanneſs of his Situation, as the Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy of his Manners, excluded from any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintanee with a Lady of <hi>Hero</hi>'s Quality.</p>
               <p>Yet how eaſily does Don <hi>Pedro</hi> the Friend, and <hi>Claudio</hi> the Lover of the Lady, ſwallow this groſs Scandal, that muſt even derive Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability from the Perſon who utters it; for he is neither an honeſt Man nor a Friend of <hi>Claudio,</hi> who is thus ſolicitous to prevent his diſhonouring himſelf by marrying a bad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but a Wretch noted for his Propenſity to all Kinds of Miſchief and Villainy, an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Hater of <hi>Claudio,</hi> and but a little while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at open Enmity with Don <hi>Pedro</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Surely theſe Circumſtances were ſufficient to make the Prince and <hi>Claudio</hi> doubt the Truth of this Story, which the Character of the Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler conſidered, as well as the Improbability of the Facts, ſeemed much more likely to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to produce Miſchief than prevent it.</p>
               <p>The Proof Don <hi>John</hi> offers them in ſupport of his Aſſertion, could have no Weight with Minds leſs ſtupidly credulous than theirs; they are to be ſhewn <hi>Hero</hi> talking to her Gallant <hi>Borachio</hi> out of her Chamber window, very unlikely that <hi>Hero</hi> ſhould be ſo imprudent, as the Night before her intended Marriage, to have an Aſſignation with a Gallant in ſo
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0430500503:262"/>
publick a Place; but their own Eyes and Ears are to be Witneſſes of this Conference; ſtrong Evidence indeed if it be realy <hi>Hero</hi> that they ſee and hear; but if it be only <hi>Margaret</hi> dreſt in her Ladies Cloaths, with ſuch powerful Reaſons as they had before to believe the whole a Fiction, how could this groſs Fallacy impoſe upon them.</p>
               <p>We are not told that <hi>Margaret</hi> was ſo very like her Lady, that in the ſame Cloaths they could not be diſtinguiſhed from each other; their Eyes are to be deceived by her Dreſs, but how if her Face happens, as certainly was the Caſe, not to be exactly like <hi>Hero</hi>'s, it cannot be pretended that it was ſo dark that they could not diſtinguiſh her Features. The ſame Degree of Light that ſhewed her Cloaths to be <hi>Hero</hi>'s would diſcover the Face to be <hi>Margaret</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Let it be granted, however, that their Sight was deceived (though, all Things conſidered, it is not poſſible to conceive how) yet as they heard plainly all the Diſcourſe that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Counterfeit <hi>Hero</hi> and her Lover, why did not the Voice of <hi>Margaret</hi> diſcover the Cheat? Strange Abſurdity! Let us ſee how the Original has provided againſt all theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Alban,</hi> who is ſecretly in love with the Princeſs <hi>Geneura,</hi> having ſeduced a young Maid that attended on her Perſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon her, by extravagant Promiſes, that were contrived to pleaſe at once her Ambition,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0430500503:263"/>
and weaken the Force of her Jealouſy, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him in his Deſign of gaining her royal Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for his Wife, diſcovering, by her Means, that the Princeſs had not only a Diſlike to him, but had beſtowed her Heart upon <hi>Ariodant:</hi> Rage and Deſpair ſuggeſt to him a Scheme for interrupting the Happineſs of the two Lovers, and gratifying his Revenge, which was now his predominant Paſſion, he tells <hi>Dalinda,</hi> that if ſhe wiſhes to ſee him cured of his hopeleſs Love for the Princeſs, ſhe muſt aſſume as much of her Appearance as the wearing her Apparel and rich Ornaments could give her, and thus diſguiſed, receive him to her Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dalinda</hi> willing to revive her Lover's decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſion by an Artifice that flattered her own Vanity, fondly agrees to his Propoſal, and for many ſucceſſive Nights, meets him at the uſual Place of Aſſignation; which, was in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes Summer Apartment dreſt in her Cloaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polyneſſo</hi> having ſucceeded thus far, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches <hi>Ariodant</hi> with his breach of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in addreſſing <hi>Geneura,</hi> of whoſe Affections he was in abſolute Poſſeſſion; <hi>Ariodant</hi> inſiſts that himſelf is the favoured Lover, the Duke to convince him of the contrary, conducts him to a Place from whence he could ſee him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the Princeſſes Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dalinda</hi> in Shape and Statue not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from her Miſtreſs, her Face ſhaded by the royal Veil, that <hi>Geneura,</hi> and only <hi>Geneura</hi> was accuſtomed to wear, ſtanding as uſual at
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0430500503:264"/>
the Chamber Window, lets down the ſilken Cord to her Lover, and receives him with a tender Embrace, <hi>Ariodant</hi> maddening at this Sight, believes his Miſtreſs falſe; and <hi>Polyneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s Treachery produces all the Effects he could have wiſhed.</p>
               <p>Here the Contrivance is plauſible enough, the Characters are properly diſtinguiſhed, each acts upon Motives probable and natural, and the Incidents that follow are the neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of thoſe Actions. Why <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected theſe Circumſtances for others, wholly inconſiſtent and ridiculous, is not eaſy to gueſs; we ſhall find him altering the ſucceeding Part of the Plot with the ſame utter diſregard to probability and contempt of Decorum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret</hi> having done her Part towards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming her Miſtreſs, without knowing any Thing of the Matter, though her Diſcourſe with <hi>Borachio</hi> was calculated to raiſe the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Suſpicions; aſſiſts her next Morning to dreſs for her Wedding, attends her to the Church, hears the deſigned Bridegroom refuſe her Hand, proclaim her a Wanton, and urge her laſt Night's looſe Diſcourſe with <hi>Borachio</hi> from her Chamber Window as a Proof: Yet all the while ſhe appears wholly inſenſible of what had happened, neither concerned for her Miſtreſs, whom ſhe had ruined without Deſign, nor anxious for her own Safety, that ſeemed to depend upon a candid Confeſſion; for it was not likely her Treachery could be long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. Thus ſupernaturally (if what is out
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0430500503:265"/>
of Nature may be called above it) is the Plot brought to perfection, nor is the unravelling of it leſs happily imagined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Borachio</hi> having received his promiſed Ducats from Don <hi>John,</hi> the Moment after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Margaret</hi> was ended, meets an Acquaintance of his, named <hi>Conrade,</hi> in the Street, to whom he is impatient to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his good Luck.</p>
               <p>'Tis true the Secret is of Importance, and if known, endangers his Life; the Place alſo is very improper for ſuch a Converſation, being the Street, and near <hi>Leonato</hi>'s Houſe, where the Scene of his Treachery had been acted; add to this that the Rain obliges them to ſtand cloſe up to the Door, which expoſes them to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of having even their Whiſpers overheard, if any one was near it: Yet ſuch is <hi>Borachio</hi>'s extream eagerneſs to tell his wicked Exploit, that he never thinks of carrying his Friend to his own Lodgings, where he may boaſt in Safety, but in a rainy Night ſtands in the Street, cloſe to the Door of the Man whoſe Daughter he had injured, and there at his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure relates the whole treacherous Contrivance.</p>
               <p>However, all this happens exactly right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Watch who is poſted about <hi>Leonato</hi>'s Houſe, hear every Syllable, that is ſpoken, and underſtanding that one of theſe Villains had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed the Lady <hi>Hero,</hi> and made her intended Bridegroom reſolve to diſgrace her the nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Two or three abſolute Ideots, are here very artfully introduced for Conſtable and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for had they the leſt Ray of Reaſon to direct them, they muſt have conceived that it was abſolutely neceſſary to acquaint <hi>Leonato</hi> immediately with the Treaſon, that had been practiſed againſt his Daughter, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ignominious Treatment ſhe was to ſuffer in Conſequence of it the next Morning.</p>
               <p>This Method of protracting the Diſcovery, is not indeed very ingenious, but the Poet's Occaſions are anſwered by it, and that is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. <hi>Claudio</hi>'s deſigned Vengeance ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Interruption, the Lady is ſhamefully refuſed, hence ariſe two or three new Contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, ſhe is believed to be dead, <hi>Claudio</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages to marry another in a Maſque, and when he has given his Hand to this unknown Lady, is ſurprized with the Sight of his living <hi>Hero</hi>; whoſe Death after he had been convinced of her Innocence he had paſſionately lamented. Theſe Incidents, were they ever ſo natural, cannot affect the Readers either with Pity or Surprize, ſince they are let into the Secret beforehand: and can anticipate the Cataſtrophe.</p>

                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has deviated from the Original, as much in the drawing his Characters, as the Diſpoſition of his Plan. Nothing can be more different than the Sentiments and Behaviour of <hi>Ariodant</hi> and <hi>Claudio,</hi> in Circumſtances nearly alike. Both are repreſentedas paſſionate Lovers, happy in the Poſſeſſion of their Miſtreſſes Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, yet prevailed upon to think them falſe through the Treachery of a Villain; but <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> yields only to the ſtrongeſt Conviction, <hi>Claudio</hi> to the groſſeſt Artifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariodant</hi>'s Grief, Rage and Jealouſy, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in a fixed Deſpair; which prompts him to lay violent Hands on his own Life. <hi>Claudio</hi> is actuated by a Deſire of Revenge, and that of the meaneſt Sort, for he ſuffers the ſuppoſed Gallant to eſcape, and only meditates the Ruin of the Lady.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariodant</hi> fights with his own Brother, to preſerve the Life of her who had injured him: <hi>Claudio</hi> without any neceſſity, expoſes his Miſtreſs publickly in Church, brings Ruin and Contempt on her, and everlaſting Shame and Affliction on her poor Father, to whom he had been obliged, for an hoſpitable Reception, and an intended Benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claudio</hi> is mean, ſelfiſh, ungenerous and cruel: Qualities, that are ſeldom found in the Heroe and Lover, and he is repreſented as both.</p>

                  <hi>Ariodant</hi> is always conſiſtent with his Character, too brave, to be actuated by a mean Deſire of Revenge, too much in love, to be guided by Reaſon; hence ariſes the ſeveral Extravagancies he is guilty of, but in all, the Manners of the Soldier and Lover are invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably preſerved.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>"LEIR</hi> the Son of <hi>Baldub,</hi> was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ruler over the <hi>Britains,</hi> in the Year of the World 3105. At what Time <hi>Joas</hi> reigned as yet in <hi>Juda.</hi> This <hi>Leir</hi> was a Prince of noble Demeanor, governing his Land and Subjects in great Wealth. He made the Town of <hi>Cairleir</hi> now called <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> which ſtandeth upon the River of <hi>Dore.</hi> It is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0430500503:270"/>
writ that he had by his Wife three Daughters, without other Iſſue, whoſe Names were, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norilla, Regan</hi> and <hi>Cordilla,</hi> which Daughters he greatly loved, but eſpecially the youngeſt, <hi>Cordilla,</hi> far above the two Elder.</p>
               <p>When this <hi>Leir</hi> was come to great Years, and began to wear unweildy through Age, he thought to underſtand the Affections of his Daughters towards him, and prefer her whom he beſt loved, to the Succeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Therefore, he firſt aſked <hi>Gonorilla</hi> the eldeſt, how well ſhe loved him: the which calling her Gods to record, proteſted that ſhe loved him more than her own Life, which by Right and Reaſon ſhould be moſt dear unto her, with which Anſwer the Father being well pleaſed, turned to the ſecond and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her, how well ſhe loved him? which anſwered (confirming her Sayings with great Oaths) that ſhe loved him more than Tongue can expreſs, and far above all other Creatures in the World.</p>
               <p>Then called he his youngeſt Daughter <hi>Cordilla</hi> before him, and aſked of her what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt ſhe made of him: Unto whom ſhe made this Anſwer as followeth: Knowing the great Love, and fatherly Zeal you have always borne towards me (for the which, that I may not anſwer you otherwiſe than I think, and as my Conſcience leadeth me) I proteſt to you, that I have always loved you, and ſhall continually while I live, love you as my natural Father, and if you would more underſtand of the Love
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0430500503:271"/>
that I bear you, aſſertayn yourſelf, that ſo much as you have, ſo much you are worth, and ſo much I love you, and no more.</p>
               <p>The Father being nothing content with this Anſwer, married the two eldeſt Daughters, the one unto the Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> named <hi>Henninus,</hi> and the other unto the Duke of <hi>Albania</hi> called <hi>Maglanus,</hi> and betwixt them after his Death, he willed and ordained his Land ſhould be divided, and the one half thereof ſhould be immediately aſſigned unto them in Hand; but for the third Daughter <hi>Cordilla,</hi> he reſerved nothing.</p>
               <p>Yet it fortuned that one of the Princes of <hi>Gallia</hi> (which now is called <hi>France</hi>) whoſe Name was <hi>Aganippus,</hi> hearing of the Beauty, Womanhood and good Conditions of the ſayd <hi>Cordilla,</hi> deſired to have her in Marriage, and ſent over to her Father, requiring that he might have her to Wife, to whom Anſwer was made that he might have his Daughter; but for any Dowry he could have none, for all was promiſed and aſſured to her other Siſters already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aganippus,</hi> notwithſtanding this Anſwer of Denyall to receive any Thing by way of Dower with <hi>Cordilla,</hi> took her to Wife, only moved thereto (I ſay) for reſpect of her Perſon and amiable Virtues. This <hi>Aganippus</hi> was one of the twelve Kings that ruled <hi>Gallia</hi> in thoſe Days, as in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory it is recorded. But to proceed, after that <hi>Leir</hi> was fallen into Age, the two Dukes, that had married his two

eldeſt Daughters, thinking it long ere the Government of the Land did come to their Hands, aroſe againſt him in Armour, and reſt from him the Governance of the Land, upon Conditions to be continued for tearme of Life: By the which he was put to his Portion, that is, to live after a Rate aſſigned to him for the Maintenance of his Eſtate, which in proceſs of Time was diminiſhed as well by <hi>Maglianus,</hi> as by <hi>Henninius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the greateſt Grief that <hi>Leir</hi> took, was to ſee the Unkindneſs of his Daughters, who ſeemed to think that all was too much which their Father had. The ſame being never ſo little, in ſo much that going from the one to the other, he was brought to that Miſery, that they would allow him only one Servant to wait upon him. In the End ſuch was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, or as I may ſay, the unnaturalneſs which he found in his two Daughters, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their fair and pleaſant Words uttered in Time paſt, that being conſtrained of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, he fled the Land and ſailed into <hi>Gallia,</hi> there to ſeek ſome Comfort of his youngeſt Daughter <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> whom before he hated.</p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Cordeilla</hi> hearing he was arrived in poor Eſtate, ſhe firſt ſent to him privately a Sum of Money to apparel himſelf withall, and to retain a certain Number of Servants, that might attend upon him in honorable Wiſe, as apperteyned to the Eſtate which he had borne. And then ſo accompanyed, ſhe appointed him to come to the Court, which he did, and was

ſo joyfully, honorably and lovingly received, both by his Son in Law <hi>Aganippus,</hi> and alſo by his Daughter <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> that his Heart was greatly comforted: For he was no leſs honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than if he had been King of the whole Country himſelf.

               <head>FABLE Of the TRAGEDY of King <hi>LEAR.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>LEAR</hi> King of <hi>Britain,</hi> being old and weary of the Toils of Government, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to reſign his Crown, and divide his Dominions amongſt his three Daughters, two of whom were married to the Dukes of <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> and the third addreſſed to by the King of <hi>France</hi> and Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princeſſeſs being commanded by their Father, to declare with what Degree of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection each loves him, that he may know which of them is intitled to the greateſt Share of his Bounty: <hi>Gonerill</hi> the eldeſt, begins with aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that ſhe loves him beyond every Thing that is moſt dear and precious in the World: <hi>Regan</hi> the ſecond Daughter, profeſſes herſelf an Enemy to all other Joys, but that of loving and being beloved by him: To each of theſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0430500503:275"/>
Ladies the old King aſſigns one third of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Then addreſſing himſelf in a particularly tender Manner to <hi>Cordelia,</hi> his youngeſt Daughter, he aſks her what ſhe has to ſay, to draw a Dowry more opulent than her Siſters. <hi>Cordelia</hi> tells him, Nothing; the King ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bids her ſpeak again, ſhe with a modeſt plainneſs replies: That ſhe loves him as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Child ought to love an indulgent Father, neither more nor leſs.</p>
               <p>The King enraged at this Speech, bids her avoid his Preſence, declares that he will baniſh her for ever from his Heart, and divides that Portion of his Kingdom, which he had deſign'd for her, between her two Siſters. Then giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Crown to <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them in return, only Maintenance for himſelf and an hundred Knights.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> for oppoſing this frantick Reſignation, and offering to Plead in favour of <hi>Cordelia,</hi> is baniſhed for ever by the old King. The King of <hi>France</hi> marries <hi>Cordelia</hi> without a Portion, and takes her away with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goneril</hi> and <hi>Regan</hi> ſoon grow weary of their old Father, and agree to treat him with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. He is firſt affronted by <hi>Goneril</hi>'s At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and ſhe treating his Complaints of their rude Behaviour with Lightneſs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting to the number of his Followers, which ſhe wants to have reduced to Fifty, the King
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0430500503:276"/>
leaves her in a Rage, and repairs to the Court of his Daughter <hi>Regan,</hi> who having received an Account of what had paſs'd from her Siſter, comes to the Earl of <hi>Gloſter</hi>'s Caſtle in order to avoid him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lear</hi> in his way ſtopping at <hi>Gloſter</hi>'s Caſtle, meets his two Daughters there; they both join to treat him with the utmoſt Cruelty, and abſolutely refuſe to give him Entertainment in either of their Palaces, unleſs he diſbands all his Knights, and ſubmits to be attended by their Servants.</p>
               <p>The old King, in an agony of Grief and Rage at this barbarous and unnatural Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his two Daughters, to whom he had given all, ruſhes out of the Caſtle, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he will not ſtay under the ſame Roof with them. They, who deſire nothing ſo much as his Abſence, command the Earl of <hi>Gloſter</hi> to ſhut his Gates, and ſuffer him to go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he pleaſes. The Earl repreſents to them, that the King muſt inevitably Periſh in the Storm, which then raged with the utmoſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, there being no Houſe nor Shed within ſeveral Miles to Shelter him, and humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats that he may be allowed to follow his old Maſter, and invite him in. The wicked Princeſſes peremptorily forbid him to afford their Father any Relief, and threaten'd him with Death if he Diſobeys.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, the Earl ſecretly ſeeks for the King, whoſe Griefs had now turned
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0430500503:277"/>
his Brain, and conveys him to a Farm-houſe, Afterwards being informed that there was a Plot laid to take away his Life, he enjoins his Attendants to carry him to <hi>Dover,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them with Neceſſaries for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmund,</hi> the Baſtard Son of <hi>Gloſter,</hi> having by his wicked Arts prevailed upon his Father to Diſinherit his lawful Son <hi>Edgar,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve his Death, now betrays his Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Diſcovers, to the two enraged Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, what he had done for the old King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gloſter</hi> is ſeiz'd, bound, and his Eyes trod out by the Duke of <hi>Cornwal</hi>; and in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Condition thruſt out of his own Caſtle, and contemptuouſly bid to ſmell his way to <hi>Dover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The injured <hi>Edgar,</hi> who had aſſum'd the Appearance of a mad Man, to elude an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Puniſhment from his Father, meets him in this miſerable Condition, and ſtill keeping himſelf unknown, offers to be his Guide, and lead him to whatever Place he has a mind to go. <hi>Gloſter</hi> overwhelmed with Deſpair, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be conducted to a Hill near <hi>Dover,</hi> from whence he means to caſt himſelf into the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edgar</hi> ſtill counterfeiting the mad Man, leads his Father to <hi>Dover,</hi> and thinking to cure his Deſpair by ſeeming to give way to it, yet preventing its Effects, tells him, that they have gain'd the Summit of the Hill. <hi>Gloſter</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0430500503:278"/>
bids him lead him to the Verge of it; then taking leave of the ſuppoſed mad Man, ſprings Forwards with an Intention to precipitate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Bottom, but falls flat on the level Plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edgar</hi> approaches him, and changing his Voice, expreſſes the extreameſt Amazement at his having fallen from ſuch an enormous Height without being bruis'd to Peices. <hi>Gloſter</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf miraculouſly preſerved, declares that he will no more attempt to put an End to his miſerable Life, but wait patiently for his Diſſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edgar</hi> confirms him in thoſe Thoughts, and offers to conduct hlm to ſome Retreat. As they are going, the Princeſs <hi>Regan</hi>'s Steward, who had been ſent with Letters from her and her Siſter to the Baſtard <hi>Edmund,</hi> meets them, and ſeeing <hi>Gloſter,</hi> on whoſe Head a Price had been ſet, offers to murder him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edgar</hi> defends his Father, and kills the Steward, and ſearching his Pockets, finds a Letter from the Princeſs <hi>Goneril</hi> to his Brother, in which ſhe deſires him to Aſſaſſinate her Huſband the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and promiſes to Reward him for that Action with her Hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edgar</hi> reſerves this Letter for a Proof of his Brother's wickedneſs; and having placed his Father in Safety, joins the <hi>French</hi> Army, that with their Queen <hi>Cordelia</hi> at their Head, had
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0430500503:279"/>
come into <hi>England</hi> to revenge the Injuries of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>Lear,</hi> and to reſtore him to his Crown.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> though he deteſted the cruel Uſage that <hi>Lear</hi> had received, raiſes an Army to oppoſe <hi>Cordelia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Regan.</hi> whoſe Huſband had been killed by one of his Servants, as he was ſtamping on <hi>Gloſter</hi>'s Eyes, gives the Command of her Forces to the Baſtard <hi>Edmund,</hi> with whom ſhe, as well as her Siſter, is in love; and joins her Brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Before the Armies engage, <hi>Edgar,</hi> diſguiſed, gives the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> his Wife's Letter which he had taken from the Steward; bids him read it; and if Victory declares on his Side, a Champion will appear at the firſt Sound of the Trumpet to prove the Truth of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein.</p>
               <p>After this the Battle is fought; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are victorious; <hi>Lear</hi> and <hi>Cordelia</hi> are taken Priſoners; and <hi>Edmund</hi> gives ſecret Orders to the Officer who guards them to put them to death.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> having read the Letter, by which he diſcovered his Wife's Adultery, and <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Crimes, arreſts him for high Treaſon, and declares, if at the Sound of the Trumpet, no Champion appears to prove it by Force of Arms, himſelf will undertake the Combat, and maintain the Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0430500503:280"/>The Trumpet ſounds, <hi>Edgar</hi> appears in Arms, and after ſumming up his Brother's Crimes, challenges him to the Combat; they fight; <hi>Edmund</hi> is mortally wounded; <hi>Edgar</hi> then diſcovers himſelf, relates the Hardſhips he had ſuffered; the Condition in which he found his miſerable Father; what he had done for him, and how upon his diſcovering himſelf to him, the ſtrong Surpriſe, Grief, and mingled Rapture, ſiezed with ſuch Force upon his Heart (already almoſt broken with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries) that he expired in the Arms of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> who, in the Diſguiſe of a menial Servant, had contrnually followed the diſtreſſed King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmund,</hi> ſtruck with Remorſe at this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Tale, confeſſes all his Crimes; aſks Pardon of his Brother, and willing to do ſome Good before he dies, owns the ſecret Orders he had given to put <hi>Lear</hi> and <hi>Cordelia</hi> to death, and urges them to ſend and prevent the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them.</p>
               <p>The Meſſenger arrives too late; <hi>Cordelia</hi> had been juſt ſtrangled by a Soldier, whom the old King had afterwards killed; <hi>Lear</hi> brings <hi>Cordelia</hi> in dead in his Arms, and while he is lamenting over her, dies.</p>
               <p>The good Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> expires immediately after with Grief. <hi>Goneril</hi> and <hi>Regan,</hi> poiſoned by each other through Jealouſy, die in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and <hi>Edmund</hi> alſo dies by the Wound
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0430500503:281"/>
he had received from his Brother, who is by the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> reſtored to his Eſtates and Honours.</p>
               <p>This Fable, although drawn from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Hiſtory of King <hi>Lear,</hi> is ſo altered by <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> in ſeveral Circumſtances, as to render it much more improbable than the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: There we are ſufficiently diſguſted with the Folly of a Man, who gives away one Half of his Kingdom to two of his Daughters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they flatter him with Profeſſions of the moſt extravagant Love; and deprives his youngeſt Child of her Portion for no other Crime but confining her Expreſſions of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs within the Bounds of plain and ſimple Truth.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has carried this Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance much farther; he ſhews us a King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning his Kingdom, his Crown and Dignity to his two Daughters; reſerving nothing to himſelf, not even a decent Maintenance; but ſubmitting to a mean Dependance on the Bounty of his Children; whom, by promiſing Rewards proportionable to the Degree of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery they laviſh on him, he has ſtimulated to outvie each other in artful Flouriſhes on their Duty and Affection toward him.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Tell me, Daughters,</l>
                  <l>(Since now we will diveſt us, both of Rule,</l>

                  <l>Which of you, ſhall we ſay, doth love us moſt?</l>
                  <l>That we our largeſt Bounty may extend</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lear</hi> does not run mad till the third Act; yet his Behaviour towards <hi>Cordelia</hi> in this firſt Scene has all the Appearance of a Judgment totally depraved: he aſks <hi>Cordelia</hi> what ſhe has to ſay to draw a Dowry more opulent than her Siſters.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſuggeſted to her a Motive for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding them in Expreſſions of Love: the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſintereſtedneſs of her Anſwer afforded the ſtrongeſt Conviction of her Sincerity, and that ſhe poſſeſſed the higheſt Degree of filial Affection for him, who hazarded the Loſs of all her Fortune to confine herſelf to ſimple Truth in her Profeſſions of it: yet, for this, <hi>Lear</hi> baniſhes her his Sight, conſigns her over to Want, and loads her with the deepeſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations. What leſs than Phrenzy can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire a Rage ſo groundleſs, and a Conduct ſo abſurd! <hi>Lear,</hi> while in his Senſes, acts like a mad Man, and from his firſt Appearance to his laſt ſeems to be wholly deprived of his Reaſon.</p>
               <p>In the Hiſtory <hi>Lear</hi> Diſinherits <hi>Cordelia,</hi> but we read of no other kind of Severity exerted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her. The King of <hi>France,</hi> as well in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0430500503:283"/>
the Hiſtory as the Play, charm'd with the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Beauty of the injured <hi>Cordelia,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries her without a Portion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> does not introduce this Prince till after the abſurd Trial <hi>Lear</hi> made of his Daughters Affection is over. The Lover who is made to Marry the diſinherited <hi>Cordelia</hi> on account of her Virtue, is very injudiciouſly contrived to be Abſent when ſhe gave ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Teſtimony of it, and is touch'd by a cold Juſtification of her Fame, and that from herſelf, when he might have been charm'd with a ſhining Inſtance of her Greatneſs of Soul, and inviolable Regard to Truth.</p>
               <p>So unartfully has the Poet managed this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, that <hi>Cordelia</hi>'s noble Diſintereſtedneſs is apparent to all but him who was to be the moſt influenced by it. In the Eyes of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe is debaſed, not exalted; reduced to the abject Neceſſity of defending her own Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſeeking rather to free herſelf from the Suſpicion of Guilt, than modeſtly enjoying the conſcious Senſe of ſuperior Virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lear</hi>'s Invective againſt her to the King of <hi>France</hi> is conceived in the moſt ſhocking Terms.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>I would not from your Love make ſuch a ſtray,</l>

               <p>Yet a Moment after, without knowing any more of the Matter, he laviſhes the warmeſt Praiſes on her Virtues, and offers to make her (loaded as ſhe is with her Father's Curſes, and deprived of the Dower he expected with her) Queen of <hi>France.</hi> This Conduct would be juſt and natural, had he been a Witneſs of her noble Behaviour; but doubtful as it muſt have appeared to him in ſuch perplexing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, 'tis extravagant and abſurd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has deviated widely from Hiſtory in the Cataſtrophe of his Play; the Chronicle tells us, that King <hi>Lear</hi> having been diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his rebellious Sons in Law of that Half of the Kingdom which he had reſerved for himſelf, and forced, by repeated Indignities from his Daughters, to take Refuge in <hi>France,</hi> was received with great Tenderneſs by <hi>Cordelia,</hi> who prevailed upon her Huſband to attempt his Reſtoration; accordingly an Army of <hi>Frenchmen</hi> paſs'd over into <hi>Britain,</hi> by which, the Dukes of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Albany</hi> being defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, King <hi>Lear</hi> was reſtored to his Crown, died in Peace two Years after, and left his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Cordelia.</hi> In <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> the Forces of the two wicked Siſters are victorious, <hi>Lear</hi> and the pious <hi>Cordelia</hi> are taken Priſoners, ſhe is hanged in Priſon, and the old King dies with Grief. Had <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> followed the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0430500503:286"/>
he would not have violated the Rules of poetical Juſtice; he repreſents Vice puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Virtue rewarded; in the Play one Fate overwhelms alike the Innocent and the Guilty, and the Facts in the Hiſtory are wholly changed to produce Events, neither probable, neceſſary, nor juſt.</p>
               <p>Several Incidents in this Play, are borrowed from the Hiſtory of the old Prince of <hi>Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> in <hi>Sidney</hi>'s <hi>Arcadia,</hi> which I ſhall here Tranſcribe.</p>
               <p>"IT was in the Kingdom of <hi>Galacia,</hi> the Seaſon being (as in the Depth of Winter) very cold, and as then ſodainly Grown to ſo extream and foul a Storm, that never any Winter, I think, brought forth a fowler Child; ſo that the Princes were even compelled by the Hail, that the Pride of the Wind blew in their Faces, to ſeek ſome ſhrowding Place, which a certain hollow Rock offering unto them, they made it their Shield againſt the Tempeſt's Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And ſo ſtaying there till the Violence thereof was paſſed, they heard the Speech of a Couple, who not perceiving them, being hid within the rude Canupie, held a ſtrange and pitiful Diſputation, which made them Step out, yet in ſuch Sort, as they might ſee unſeen.</p>
               <p>There they perceived an aged Man, and a young, ſcarcely come to the Age of a Man; both poorly arrayed, extreamly Weather-beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; the old Man blind, the young Man lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; and yet through all theſe Miſeries, in both there ſeemed to appear a Kind of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, not ſuitable to that Affliction: But the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0430500503:287"/>
firſt Words they heard were theſe of the old Man.</p>
               <p>Well <hi>Leonatus,</hi> ſaid he, ſince I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade thee to lead me to that which ſhould end my Grief, and thy Trouble, let me now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee to leave me: Fear not, my Miſery cannot be greater than it is, and nothing doth become me but Miſery. Fear not the Danger of my blind Steps, I cannot Fall worſe than I am, and do not, I pray thee, do not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately continue to infect thee with my Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but fly, fly from this Region, only worthy of me.</p>
               <p>Dear Father, anſwered he, do not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me the only Remnant of my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while I have Power to do you Service, I am not wholly miſerable.</p>
               <p>Ah my Son, ſaid he, and with that he groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if Sorrow ſtrove to break his Heart, how evil fits it me to have ſuch a Son, and how much doth thy Kindneſs upbraid my Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe doleful Speaches, and ſome others to like Purpoſe (well ſhewing they had not been born to the Fortune they were in) moved the Princes to go out unto them, and aſk the younger, who they were?</p>
               <p>Sirs, anſwered he with a good Grace, and made the more agreeable by a certain noble Kind of Piteouſneſs, I ſee well you are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that know not our Miſery, ſo well here known, that no Man dare know but that we muſt be miſerable; indeed our State is ſuch, as though nothing is ſo needful unto us as Pity, yet nothing is more dangerous unto us, than to make ourſelves ſo known as may ſtir Pity;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0430500503:288"/>
but your Preſence promiſeth, that Cruelty ſhall not over-run Hate, and if it did, in Truth our State is ſunk below the Degree of Fear. This old Man whom I lead, was lately rightful Prince of this Country of <hi>Paphlagonia</hi>; by the hard-hearted Ungratefulneſs of a Son of his, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived not only of his Kingdom, whereof no foreign Forces were even able to ſpoile him, but of his Sight, the Riches which Nature grants to the pooreſt Creatures; whereby, and by other his unnatural Dealings, he hath been driven to ſuch Grief, as even now he would have had me to have led him to the Top of this Rock, thence to caſt himſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Death, and ſo would have made me, who received my Life of him, to be the Worker of his Deſtruction. But noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſaid he, if either of you have a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and feel what dutiful Affection is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in a Son's Heart, let me entreat you to convey this afflicted Prince to ſome Place of Reſt and Security; amongſt your worthy Acts it ſhall be none of the leaſt, that a King of of ſuch Might and Fame, and ſo unjuſtly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, is in any Sort by you relieved.</p>
               <p>But before they could make him Anſwer, his Father began to Speak: Ah my Son, ſaid he, how evil an Hiſtorian are you, that leave out the chief Knot of all the Diſcourſe? My Wickedneſs, my Wickedneſs; and if thou doeſt it to ſpare my Eares, the only Senſe now left me proper for Knowledge, aſſure yourſelf thou doeſt miſtake me: And I take Witneſs of that Sun which you ſee, with that he caſt up his blind Eyes, as if he would Hunt for Light,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0430500503:289"/>
and wiſh myſelf in worſe Caſe than I do wiſh myſelf, which is as Evill as may be, if I Speak untruly, that nothing is ſo welcome to my Thoughts, as the publiſhing of my Shame. Therefore know you Gentlemen (to whom from my Heart I wiſh that it may not prove ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Foretoken of Misfortune to have met with ſuch a Miſer as I am) that whatſoever my Son (o God that Truth binds me to Reproach him with the Name of my Son) hath ſaid is true. But beſides thoſe Truthes, this alſo is true, that having had in lawful Marriage, of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit to bear Royal Children, this Son (ſuch a one as partly you ſee, and better ſhall know by my ſhort Declaration) and ſo enjoyed the Expectations in the World of him till he was grown to juſtilfy their Expectations, ſo as I needed envy no Father for the chief Comfort of Mortality, to leave another ones-ſelf after me. I was carried by a Baſtard Son of mine, if at leaſt I be bound to believe the Words of that baſe Woman my Concubine, his Mother, firſt to miſlike, then to hate, laſtly to deſtroy, or to do my beſt to deſtroy this Son, I think, you think undeſerving Deſtruction; what Ways he uſed to bring me to it, if I ſhould tell you, I ſhould tediouſly trouble you with as much poiſonous Hypocriſy, deſperate Fraud, ſmooth Malice, hidden Ambition, and ſmiling Envy, as in any living Perſon could be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd: But I liſt it not, no Remembrance of Naughtineſs delights me but mine own, and methinks the accuſing his Traps, might in ſome Manner excuſe my Fault, which certainly I loth to do. But the Concluſion is, that I
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0430500503:290"/>
gave Orders to ſome Servants of mine, whom I thought as apt for ſuch Charities as myſelf, to lead him out into a Forreſt, and there to kill him: But thoſe Thieves, better natured to my Son than myſelf, ſpared his Life, letting him go to learn to live poorly, which he did, giving himſelf to be a private Soldier in a Country here by; but as he was ready to be greatly advanced for ſome noble Pieces of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which he did, he heard News of me, who (Drunk in my Affection to that unlawful and unnatural Son of mine) ſuffered myſelf to be governed by him, that all Favours and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſſed by him, all Offices and Places of Importance diſtributed to his Favourites; ſo that ere I was aware, I had left myſelf no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Name of King, which he ſhortly weary of too, with many Indignities (if any Thing may be called an Indignity which was laid upon me) threw me out of my Seat, and put out my Eyes; and then proud in his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny let me go, neither impriſoning, nor killing me, but rather delighting to make me feel my Miſery; Miſery indeed, if ever there were any, full of Wretchedneſs, full of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and fulleſt of Guiltineſs. And as he came to the Crown by ſo unjuſt Means, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly he kept it, by Force of Stranger Soldiers in Cittadels, the Neſts of Tyranny, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Liberty; diſarming all his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, that no Man durſt ſhew himſelf a well willer of mine, to ſay the Truth, I think few of them being ſo, conſidering my cruel Folly to my good Son, and fooliſh Kindneſs to my unkind Baſtard; but if there were any
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0430500503:291"/>
who felt a Pity for ſo great a Fall, and had yet any Sparks of unſtaine Duty left in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me; yet durſt they not ſhew it, ſcarcely with giving me Alms at their Doors, which yet was the only Suſtenance of my diſtreſſed Life, nobody daring to ſhew ſo much Charity as to lend me a Hand to guide my dark Steps; till this Son of mine, God knows, worthy of a more virtuous, and more fortunate Father, forgetting my abominable Wrongs, not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Danger, and neglecting the preſent good Way he was in of doing himſelf good, came hither to do this kind Office you ſee him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form towards me, to my unſpeakable Grief; not only becauſe his Kindneſs is a Glaſs even to my blind Eyes of my Naughtineſs; but that above all Griefs, it grieves me he ſhould deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately adventure the loſs of his well deſerving Life for mine, that yet owe more to Fortune for my Deſerts, as if he would carry Mudde in a Cheſt of Chryſtal; for well I know, he that now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how much ſoever (and with good Reaſon) he deſpiſeth me, of all Men deſpiſed; yet he will not let ſlip any Advantage to make away him whoſe juſt Title, enobled by Courage and Goodneſs, may one Day ſhake the Seat of a never ſecure Tyranny; and for this Cauſe I craved of him to lead me to the Top of this Rock, indeed, I muſt confeſs, with meaning to free him from ſo Serpentine a Companion as I am; but he finding what I purpoſed, only therein, ſince he was born, ſhewed himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to me: And now, Gentlemen, you have the true Story, which, I pray you, publiſh to the World, that my miſchievious Proceedings may be the Glory of his filial Piety, the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0430500503:292"/>
now left for ſo great a Merit; and if it may be, let me obtain that of you which my Son denies me, for never was there more Pity in ſaving any than in ending me; both becauſe therein my Agony ſhall end, and ſo you ſhall preſerve this excellent young Man, who elſe wilfully follows his own Ruin.</p>
               <p>The Matter, in itſelf lamentable, lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expreſſed by the old Prince, which needed not take to himſelf the Geſtures of Pity, ſince his Face could not put off the Marks thereof, greatly moved the two Princes to Compaſſion, which could not ſtay in ſuch Hearts as theirs without ſeeking Remedy: But, by and by, the Occaſion was preſented; for <hi>Plexirtus</hi> (ſo was the Baſtard called) came thither with forty Horſe, only of purpoſe to murder this Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whoſe coming he had ſoon Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thought no Eyes of ſufficient Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in ſuch a Matter but his own, and therefore come himſelf to be Actor and Spectator: and, as ſoon as he came, not regarding the weak (as he thought) Guard of but two Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome of his Followers to ſet their Hands to his in the killing of <hi>Leonatus</hi>; but the young Prince (though not otherwiſe armed but with a Sword) how falſely ſoever he was dealt with by others, would not betray him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but bravely drawing it our, made the Death of the firſt that aſſailed him, warn his Followers to come more warily after him. But then <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> were quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Parties (ſo juſt a Defence deſerving as much as old Friendſhip) and ſo did behave them among that Company (more injurious than
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0430500503:293"/>
valiant) that many of them loſt their Lives for their wicked Maſter.</p>
               <p>Yet, perhaps, had the Number of them at laſt prevailed, if the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> (lately by them made ſo) had not come unlooked for to their Succour; who (having had a Dream, which had fixed his Imagination vehemently upon ſome great Danger, preſently to follow thoſe two Princes whom he moſt dearly loved was come in all Haſte, following, as well as he could, their Track, with an Hundred Horſes, in that Country, which he thought (conſidering who then reigned) a fit Place enough to make the Stage of any Tragedy.</p>
               <p>But then the Match had been ſo ill made for <hi>Plexertus,</hi> that his ill-led Life, and worſe-got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Honour, ſhould have tumbled together to Deſtruction, had there not come in <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Telenor,</hi> with forty or fifty in their Suit, to the Defence of <hi>Plexirtus.</hi> Theſe two were Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the nobleſt Houſe of that Country, brought up from their Infancy with <hi>Plexirtus</hi>; Men of ſuch Proweſs as not to know Fear in themſelves, and yet to teach it in others that ſhould deal with them: for they had often made their Lives triumph over moſt terrible Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; never diſmayed, and ever fortunate; and, truly, no more ſettled in Valour than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Goodneſs and Juſtice; if either they had lighted on a better Friend, or could have learned to make Friendſhip a Child, and not a Father of Virtue: But bringing up (rather the Choice) having firſt knit their Minds unto him (indeed crafty enough, either to hide his Faults or never to ſhew them, but when they
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0430500503:294"/>
might pay home) they willingly held out the Courſe, rather to ſatisfy him than all the World; and rather to be good Friends than good Men; ſo as though they did not like the Evil he did, yet they liked him that did the Evil; and though not Counſellors of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, yet Protectors of the Offender.</p>
               <p>Now they having heard of this ſudden going out with ſo ſmall a Company in a Country full of evil-wiſhing Minds toward him (though they knew not the Cauſe) followed him, till they found him in ſuch Caſe as they were to venture their Lives, or elſe he to loſe his, which they did with ſuch Force of Mind and Body, that, truly, I may juſtly ſay, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> had never till then found any that could make them ſo well repeat their hardeſt Leſſon in the Feats of Arms: And, briefly, ſo they did, that if they overcame not, were they not overcome; but carried away that ungrateful Maſter of theirs to a Place of Security: howſoever, the Princes laboured to the contrary.</p>
               <p>But this Matter being thus far begun, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not the Conſtancy of the Princes ſo to leave it, but in all Haſte making Forces both in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> they had in few Days left him but only that one ſtrong Place where he was; for Fear having been the only Knot that had faſtened his People unto him, that once untied by a greater Force, they all ſcattered from him like ſo many Birds whoſe Cage had been broken.</p>
               <p>In which Seaſon the blind King, having, in the chief City of his Realm, ſet the Crown upon his Son <hi>Leonatus</hi>'s Head, with many
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0430500503:295"/>
Tears, both of Joy and Sorrow, ſetting forth to the whole People his own Fault and his Son's Virtue, after he had kiſſed him, and forced his Son to accept Honour of him, as of his new become Subject, even in a Moment died; as it ſhould ſeem, his Heart, broken with Unkindneſs and Affliction, ſtretched ſo far beyond his Limits with this Exceſs of Comfort, as it was no longer able to keep ſafe his vital Spirits.</p>
               <p>But the new King, having no leſs lovingly performed all Duties to him dead, than alive, purſued on the Siege of his unnatural Brother, as much for the Revenge of his Father, as for the eſtabliſhing his own Quiet."</p>
               <p>The under plot of <hi>Gloſter</hi> and his two Sons, in the Tragedy of King <hi>Lear,</hi> is borrowed from this foregoing ſhort Hiſtory of <hi>Leonatus</hi>; ſeveral of the Circumſtances cloſely copied; and the Characters of the Brothers nearly the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Adventure of the Rock is heightened by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>; perhaps with too little Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Probability. <hi>Gloſter,</hi> though deprived of Sight, might eaſily be ſenſible of the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between walking on a level Plain, and aſcending a ſleep and craggy Rock; nor could he poſſibly ſuppoſe, when he fell gently on that Plain, that he had precipitated himſelf from an immenſe Height to the Margin of the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> in the pathetic Deſcription he makes <hi>Edgar</hi> give of his Father's Death, had certainly the following Paſſage of the <hi>Arcadia</hi> in his Eye. "The blind King having in the chief City of his Realm ſet the Crown upon his Son <hi>Leonatus</hi>'s Head, with many Tears,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0430500503:296"/>
both of Joy and Sorrow, ſetting forth to the People his own Fault, and his Son's Virtue; after he had kiſſed him, and forced his Son to accept Honour of him, as of his new become Subject, even in a Moment died, as it ſhould ſeem, his Heart broken with Unkindneſs and Affliction, ſtretched ſo far beyond his Limits with this Exceſs of Comfort, as it was able no longer to keep ſafe his vital Spirits." <hi>Sidney.</hi>

               <p>The Chronicle of <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi>'s <hi>Arcadia</hi> are not the only Reſources <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> had for his Tragedy of <hi>Lear,</hi> if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Editor of a Collection of old Ballads, publiſhed in the Year 1726: in his Introduction to an old Ballad called, <hi>A Lamentable Song of the Death of King</hi> Lear <hi>and his three Daughters,</hi> he has theſe Words.</p>
               <p>"I cannot be certain directly as to the Time when this Ballad was written; but that it was ſome Years before the Play of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0430500503:297"/>
appears from ſeveral Circumſtances, which to mention would ſwell my Introduction too far beyond its uſual Length."</p>
               <p>It is to be wiſhed that this Writer, ſince he was reſolved not to exceed a certain Length in his Introduction, had omitted ſome Part of it, in order to introduce thoſe Circumſtances that were of infinitely more Conſequence than any thing elſe he has ſaid on the Subject of that old Ballad: if it was really written before <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>'s Play, that great Poet did not diſdain to conſult it, but has copied it more cloſely than either the Chronicle or <hi>Sidney.</hi> From thence (for 'tis mentioned no where elſe) he took the Hint of <hi>Lear</hi>'s Madneſs, and the extravagant and wanton Cruelty his Daughters exerciſed on him; the Death of King <hi>Lear</hi> is alſo exactly copied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spencer</hi> ſeems to have furniſhed <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> with the Hint of <hi>Cordelia</hi>'s Manner of Death: In the tenth Canto of the ſecond Book of his <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> he relates the Story of King <hi>Lear</hi> and his three Daughters; <hi>Cordelia,</hi> he tells us, after having reſtored her Father to his Crown, and ſucceeded to it after his Death, was by her Siſter's Children dethroned, and confined a long Time in Priſon, ſo that, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Deſpair, ſhe hanged herſelf. In <hi>Shakeſpear Cordelia</hi> does not hang herſelf, but is hanged by a Soldier; a very improper Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe for a Perſon of ſuch exemplary Virtue.</p>
               <p>The following is the old Ballad I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which bears ſo exact an Analogy to the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0430500503:298"/>
Argument of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s King <hi>Lear,</hi> that his having copied it cannot be doubted, if indeed it be true, that it was written before that Tragedy.</p>
