            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is Nothing in Nature more irkſome than general Diſcourſes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they turn chiefly upon Words. For this Reaſon I ſhall wave the Diſcuſſion of that Point which was ſtarted ſome Years ſince, Whether <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> may be called an <hi>Heroic Poem?</hi> Thoſe who will not give it that Title, may call it (if they pleaſe) a <hi>Divine Poem.</hi> It will be ſufficient to its Perfection, if it has in it all the Beauties of the higheſt Kind of Poetry; and as for thoſe who alledge it is not an Heroick Poem,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0106100100:3"/>
they advance no more to the Diminution of it, than if they ſhould ſay <hi>Adam</hi> is not <hi>Aeneas,</hi> nor <hi>Eve Helen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore examine it by the Rules of Epic Poetry, and ſee whether it falls ſhort of the <hi>Iliad</hi> or <hi>Aeneid,</hi> in the Beauties which are eſſential to that Kind of Writing. The firſt Thing to be conſider'd in an Epic Poem, is the Fable, which is perfect or imperfect, according as the Action which it relates is more or leſs ſo. This Action ſhould have three Qualifications in it. Firſt, It ſhould be but One Action. Secondly, It ſhould be an Entire Action; and Thirdly, It ſhould be a Great Action. To conſider the Action of the <hi>Iliad, Aeneid,</hi> and <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> in theſe three ſeveral Lights. <hi>Homer</hi> to preſerve the Unity of his Action haſtens into the Midſt of Things, as <hi>Horace</hi> has obſerved: Had he gone up to <hi>Leda</hi>'s Egg, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun much later, even at the Rape of <hi>Helen,</hi> or the Inveſting of <hi>Troy,</hi> it is manifeſt that the Story of the Poem would have been a Series of Several Actions. He therefore opens his Poem with the Diſcord of his Princes, and artfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaves, in the ſeveral ſucceeding Parts of it, an Account of every Thing material which relates to them, and had paſſed before this fatal Diſſenſion. After the ſame Manner, <hi>Aeneas</hi> makes his firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Seas, and within Sight of <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe the Action propoſed to be celebrated was that of his ſettling himſelf in <hi>Latium.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was neceſſary for the Reader to know what had happened to him in the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> and in the preceding Parts of his Voyage, <hi>Virgil</hi> makes his Heroe relate it by Way of Epiſode in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third Books of the <hi>Aeneid:</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of both which Books come before thoſe of the firſt Book in the Thread of the Story, tho' for preſerving of this Unity of Action, they follow
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0106100100:4"/>
it in the Diſpoſition of the Poem. <hi>Milton,</hi> in Imitation of theſe two great Poets, opens his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe Loſt</hi> with an infernal Council plotting the Fall of Man, which is the Action he propoſed to celebrate; and as for thoſe Great Actions, the Battle of the Angels, and the Creation of the World, (which preceded in Point of Time, and which, in my Opinion, would have entirely deſtroyed the Unity of his Principal Action, had he related them in the ſame Order that they happened) he caſt them into the fifth, ſixth and ſeventh Books, by way of Epiſode to this noble Poem.<note place="margin">Vid. the End of <hi>Spect.</hi> 327.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> himſelf allows, that <hi>Homer</hi> has nothing to boaſt of as to the Unity of his Fable, tho' at the ſame Time that great Critick and Philoſopher endeavours to palliate this Imperfection in the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet by imputing it in ſome Meaſure to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature of an Epic Poem. Some have been of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the <hi>Aeneid</hi> alſo labours in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and has Epiſodes which may be looked upon as Excreſcencies rather than as Parts of the Action. On the contrary, the Poem, which we have now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Conſideration, hath no other Epiſodes than ſuch as naturally ariſe from the Subject, and yet is filled with ſuch a Multitude of aſtoniſhing Incidents, that it gives us at the ſame Time a Pleaſure of the greateſt Variety, and of the greateſt Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; uniform in its Nature, tho' diverſified in the Execution.</p>
            <p>I muſt obſerve alſo, that, as <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Poem which was deſigned to celebrate the Original of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, has deſcribed the Birth of its great Rival, the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Common-wealth: <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> with the like Art in his Poem on the Fall of Man, has related the Fall of thoſe Angels who are his profeſſed Enemies. Beſide the many other Beauties in ſuch an Epiſode, it's running parallel
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0106100100:5"/>
with the great Action of the Poem, hinders it from breaking the Unity ſo much as another Epiſode would have done, that had not ſo great an Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the principal Subject. In ſhort, this is the ſame Kind of Beauty which the Criticks admire in the <hi>Spaniſh Fryar,</hi> or the <hi>Double Diſcovery,</hi> where the two different Plots look like Counterparts and Copies of one another.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond Qualification required in the Action of an Epic Poem is, that it ſhould be an <hi>entire</hi> Action: An Action is entire when it is compleat in all its Parts; or as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribes it, when it conſiſts of a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. Nothing ſhould go before it, be intermix'd with it, or follow after it, that is not related to it. As on the contrary, no ſingle Step ſhould be omitted in that juſt and regular Progreſs which it muſt be ſuppoſed to take from its Original to its Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Thus we ſee the Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> in its Birth, its Continuance, and Effects; and <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Settlement in <hi>Italy,</hi> carried on through all the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in his Way to it both by Sea and Land. The Action in <hi>Milton</hi> excells (I think) both the former in this Particular; we ſee it contrived in Hell, executed upon Earth, and puniſhed by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Parts of it are told in the moſt diſtinct Manner, and grow out of one another in the moſt natural Order.</p>
            <p>THE third Qualification of an Epic Poem is its <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> The Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> was of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that it embroiled the Kings of <hi>Greece,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd the Heroes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and engaged all the Gods in Factions. <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Settlement in <hi>Italy</hi> produc'd the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and gave Birth to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Subject was ſtill greater than either of the former; it does not determine the Fate of ſingle Perſons or Nations, but of a whole Species. The United Powers of Hell are joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0106100100:6"/>
for the Deſtruction of Mankind, which they effected in Part, and would have completed, had not Omnipotence it ſelf interpoſed. The principal Actors are Man in his greateſt Perfection, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in her higheſt Beauty. Their Enemies are the fallen Angels: The Meſſiah their Friend, and the Almighty their Protector. In ſhort, every Thing that is great in the whole Circle of Being, whether within the Verge of Nature, or out of it, has a proper Part aſſigned it in this admirable Poem.</p>
            <p>IN Poetry, as in Architecture, not only the Whole, but the principal Members, and every Part of them, ſhould be Great. I will not preſume to ſay, that the Book of Games in the <hi>Aeueid,</hi> or that in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> are not of this Nature, nor to reprehend <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s Simile of the Top, and many other of the ſame Kind in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> as liable to any Cenſure in this Particular; but I think We may ſay, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating from thoſe wonderful Performances, that there is an Indiſputable and Unqueſtioned Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in every Part of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> and indeed a much greater than could have been formed upon any Pagan Syſtem.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> by the Greatneſs of the Action, does not only mean that it ſhould be great in its Nature, but alſo in its Duration; or in other Words, That it ſhould have a due Length in it, as well as what we properly call Greatneſs. The juſt Meaſure of this Kind of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, he explains by the following Similitude. An Animal, no bigger than a Mite, cannot appear perfect to the Eye, becauſe the Sight takes it in at once, and has only a confuſed Idea of the Whole, and not a diſtinct Idea of all its Parts; If on the contrary you ſhould ſuppoſe an Animal of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Furlongs in Length, the Eye would be ſo filled with a ſingle Part of it, that it could not give the Mind an Idea of the whole. What theſe Animals
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0106100100:7"/>
are to the Eye, a very ſhort or a very long Action would be to the Memory. The firſt would be, as it were, loſt and ſwallowed up by it, and the other difficult to be contained in it. <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have ſhewn their principal Art in this Particular; the Action of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and that of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> were in themſelves exceeding ſhort, but are ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully extended and diverſified by the Invention of <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> and the Machinery of Gods, with the like poetical Ornaments, that they make up an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Story ſufficient to employ the Memory without overcharging it. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Action is enriched with ſuch a Variety of Circumſtances, that I have taken as much Pleaſure in reading the Contents of his Books, as in the beſt invented Story I ever met with. It is poſſible, that the Traditions, on which the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Aeneid</hi> were built, had more Circumſtances in them than the Hiſtory of <hi>the Fall of Man,</hi> as it is related in Scripture. Beſides it was eaſier for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> to daſh the Truth with Fiction, as they were in no Danger of offending the Religion of their Country by it. But as for <hi>Milton,</hi> he had not only a very few Circumſtances upon which to raiſe his Poem, but was alſo obliged to proceed with the greateſt Caution in every Thing that he added out of his own Invention. And, indeed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Reſtraints he was under, he has filled his Story with ſo many ſurpriſing Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which bear ſo cloſe Analogy with what is delivered in Holy Writ, that it is capable of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt delicate Reader, without giving Offence to the moſt ſcrupulous.</p>
            <p>THE modern Criticks have collected from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hints in the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Aeneid</hi> the Space of Time, which is taken up by the Action of each of thoſe Poems; but as a great Part of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Story was tranſacted in Regions that lie out of the Reach of the Sun and the Sphere of Day,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0106100100:8"/>
it is impoſſible to gratifie the Reader with ſuch a Calculation, which indeed would be more curious than inſtructive; None of the Criticks, either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or Modern, having laid down Rules to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe the Action of an Epic Poem with any Determined Number of Years, Days, or Hours.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Spect.</hi> 308.</note>

            <p>HAVING examined the Action of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> let us in the next Place conſider the Actors. This is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Method of conſidering; firſt the Fable, and ſecondly the Manners, or as we generally call them in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Fable and the Characters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOMER</hi> has excelled all the Heroic Poets that ever wrote, in the Multitude and Variety of his Characters. Every God that is admitted into his Poem, acts a Part which would have been ſuitable to no other Deity. His Princes are as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by their Manners as by their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and even thoſe among them, whoſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters ſeem wholly made up of Courage, differ from one another as to the particular Kinds of Courage in which they excel. In ſhort, there is ſcarce a Speech or Action in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> which the Reader may not aſcribe to the Perſon that ſpeaks or acts; without ſeeing his Name at the Head of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0106100100:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>HOMER</hi> does not only out-ſhine all other Poets in the Variety, but alſo in the Novelty of his Characters. He has introduced among his <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Princes a Perſon, who had lived in three Ages of Men, and converſed with <hi>Theſeus, Hercules, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phenius,</hi> and the firſt Race of Heroes. His principal Actor is the Son of a Goddeſs, not to mention the Off-ſpring of other Deities, who have likewiſe a Place in his Poem, and the venerable <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince who was the Father of ſo many Kings and Heroes. There is in theſe ſeveral Characters of <hi>Homer,</hi> a certain Dignity as well as Novelty, which adapts them in a more peculiar Manner to the Nature of an heroic Poem. Tho' at the ſame Time, to give them the greater Variety, he has deſcribed a <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> that is, a Buffoon among his Gods, and a <hi>Therſites</hi> among his Mortals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIRGIL</hi> falls infinitely ſhort of <hi>Homer</hi> in the Characters of his Poem, both as to their Variety and Novelty. <hi>Aeneas</hi> is indeed a perfect Character, but as for <hi>Achates,</hi> tho' he is ſtiled the Heroe's Friend, he does nothing in the whole Poem which may deſerve that Title. <hi>Gyas, Mneſtheus, Sergeſtus,</hi> and <hi>Cloenthus,</hi> are all of them Men of the ſame Stamp and Character,
<q>
                  <l>—fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum:</l>

            </p>
            <p>THERE are indeed ſeveral very natural Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the Part of <hi>Aſcanius;</hi> as that of <hi>Dido</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſufficiently admired. I do not ſee any Thing new or particular in <hi>Turnus. Pallas</hi> and <hi>Evander</hi> are remote Copies of <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Priam,</hi> as <hi>Lauſus</hi> and <hi>Mezentius</hi> are almoſt Parallels to <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander.</hi> The Characters of <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Eurialus</hi> are beautiful, but common. We muſt not forget the Parts of <hi>Sinon, Camilla,</hi> and ſome few others, which are fine Improvements on the Greek Poet.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0106100100:10"/>
In ſhort, there is neither that Variety nor Novelty in the Perſons of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> which we meet with in thoſe of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF we look into the Characters of <hi>Milton,</hi> we ſhall find that he has introduced all the Variety his Fable was capable of receiving. The whole Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Mankind was in two Perſons at the Time to which the Subject of his Poem is confined. We have, however, four diſtinct Characters in theſe two Perſons. We ſee Man and Woman in the higheſt Innocence and Perfection, and in the moſt abject State of Guilt and Infirmity. The two laſt Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters are, indeed, very common and obvious, but the two firſt are not only more magnificent, but more new than any Characters either in <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> or indeed in the whole Circle of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this Defect in the Subject of his Poem, and of the few Characters it would afford him, that he has brought into it two Actors of a ſhadowy and fictitious Nature, in the Perſons of Sin and Death, by which Means he has wrought into the Body of his Fable a very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and well-invented Allegory. <note place="margin">Vid. Spect. 279.</note>But notwithſtanding the Fineneſs of this Allegory may atone for it in ſome Meaſure; I cannot think that Perſons of ſuch a chimerical Exiſtence are proper Actors in an Epic Poem; becauſe there is not that Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Probability annexed to them, which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in Writings of this Kind, as I ſhall ſhew more at large hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIRGIL</hi> has, indeed, admitted <hi>Fame</hi> as an Actreſs in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> but the Part ſhe acts is very ſhort, and none of the moſt admired Circumſtances in that Divine Work. We find in Mock-Heroic Poems, particularly in the <hi>Diſpenſary</hi> and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin,</hi> ſeveral allegorical Perſons of this Nature, which are very beautiful in thoſe Compoſitions, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0106100100:11"/>
may, perhaps, be uſed as an Argument, that the Authors of them were of Opinion, ſuch Characters might have a Place in an Epic Work. For my own Part, I ſhould be glad the Reader would think ſo, for the Sake of the Poem I am now examining, and muſt further add, that if ſuch empty unſubſtantial Beings may be ever made Uſe of on this Occaſion, never were any more nicely imagined, and employed in more proper Actions, than thoſe of which I am now ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER principal Actor in this Poem is the great Enemy of Mankind. The Part of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is very much admired by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> as perplexing that Fable with very agreeable Plots and Intricacies, not only by the many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in his Voyage, and the Subtilty of his Behaviour, but by the various Concealments and Diſcoveries of his Perſon in ſeveral Parts of that Poem. But the crafty Being I have now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes a much longer Voyage than <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> puts in Practice many more Wiles and Stratagems, and hides himſelf under a greater Variety of Shapes and Appearances, all of which are ſeverally detected, to the great Delight and Surptiſe of the Reader.</p>
            <p>WE may likewiſe obſerve with how much Art the Poet has varied ſeveral Characters of the Perſons that ſpeak in his infernal Aſſembly. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how has he repreſented the whole God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head exerting it ſelf towards Man in its full Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence under the Three-fold Diſtinction of a Creator, a Redeemer, and a Comforter!</p>
            <p>NOR muſt we omit the Perſon of <hi>Raphael,</hi> who, amidſt his Tenderneſs and Friendſhip for Man, ſhews ſuch a Dignity and Condeſcention in all his Speech and Behaviour, as are ſuitable to a ſuperior Nature. The Angels are indeed as much diverſified in <hi>Milton,</hi> and diſtinguiſhed by their proper Parts, as the Gods are in <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil.</hi> The Reader
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0106100100:12"/>
will find nothing aſcribed to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel, Gabriel, Michael,</hi> or <hi>Raphael,</hi> which is not in a particular manner ſuitable to their reſpective Characters.</p>
            <p>THERE is another Circumſtance in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Actors of the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Aeneid,</hi> which give a peculiar Beauty to thoſe two Poems, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contrived with very great Judgment. I mean the Authors having choſen for their Heroes Perſons who were ſo nearly related to the People for whom they wrote. <hi>Achilles</hi> was a <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> the remote Founder of <hi>Rome.</hi> By this Means their Countrymen (whom they principally propoſed to themſelves for their Readers) were particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to all the Parts of their Story, and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thized with their Heroes in all their Adventures. A <hi>Roman</hi> could not but rejoice in the Eſcapes, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and Victories of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and be grieved at any Defeats, Misfortunes, or Diſappointments that befel him; as a <hi>Greek</hi> muſt have had the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for <hi>Achilles.</hi> And it is plain, that each of thoſe Poems have loſt this great Advantage, among thoſe Readers to whom their Heroes are as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or indifferent Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON</hi>'s Poem is admirable in this reſpect, ſince it is impoſſible for any of its Readers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Nation, Country or People he may belong to, not to be related to the Perſons who are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Actors in it; but what is ſtill infinitely more to its Advantage, the principal Actors in this Poem are not only our Progenitors, but our Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. We have an Actual Intereſt in every Thing they do, and no leſs than our utmoſt Happineſs is concerned, and lies at Stake in all their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſubjoin as a Corollary to the foregoing Remark, an admirable Obſervation out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which hath been very much miſrepreſented in the Quotations of ſome Modern Criticks. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'If a Man
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0106100100:13"/>
of perfect and conſummate Virtue falls into a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, it raiſes our Pity, but not our Terror, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not fear that it may be our own Caſe, who do not reſemble the ſuffering Perſon.'</q> But as that great Philoſopher adds, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'If we ſee a Man of Virtue, mixt with Infirmities, fall into any Misfortune, it does not only raiſe our Pity but our Terror; becauſe we are afraid that the like Misfortunes may happen to our ſelves, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Character of the ſuffering Perſon.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only remark in this Place, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Obſervation of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> tho' it may be true in other Occaſions, does not hold in this; becauſe in the preſent Caſe, though the Perſons who fall into Misfortune are of the moſt perfect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Virtue, it is not to be conſidered as what may poſſibly be, but what actually is our own Caſe; ſince we are embark'd with them on the ſame Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and muſt be Partakers of their Happineſs or Miſery.</p>
            <p>IN this, and ſome other very few Inſtances, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s Rules for Epic Poetry (which he had drawn from his Reflections upon <hi>Homer</hi>) cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſquare exactly with the heroic Poems which have been made ſince his Time; ſince it is evident to every impartial Judge his Rules would ſtill have been more perfect, could he have peruſed the <hi>Aeneid</hi> which was made ſome hundred years after his Death.</p>
            <p>IN my next, I ſhall go through other Parts of <hi>Miltan</hi>'s Poem; and hope that what I ſhall there advance, as well as what I have already written, will not only ſerve as a Comment upon <hi>Milton,</hi> but upon <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>

            <p>WE have already taken a general Survey of the Fable and Characters in <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe Loſt:</hi> The Parts which remain to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Method, are the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> and the <hi>Language.</hi> Before I enter upon the firſt of theſe, I muſt advertiſe my Reader, that it is my Deſign as ſoon as I have finiſhed my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reflections on theſe four ſeveral Heads, to give particular Inſtances out of the Poem now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us of Beauties and Imperfections which may be obſerved under each of them, as alſo of ſuch other Particulars as may not properly fall under any of them. This I thought fit to premiſe, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may not judge too haſtily of this Piece of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, or look upon it as imperfect, before he has ſeen the whole Extent of it.</p>
            <p>THE Sentiments in an Epic Poem are the Thoughts and Behaviour which the Author aſcribes to the Perſons whom he introduces, and are <hi>juſt</hi> when they are conformable to the Characters of the ſeveral Perſons. The Sentiments have likewiſe a Relation to <hi>Things</hi> as well as <hi>Perſons,</hi> and are then perfect when they are ſuch as are adapted to the Subject. If in either of theſe Caſes the Poet endeavours to argue or explain, to magnifie or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, to raiſe Love or Hatred, Pity or Terror, or any other Paſſion, we ought to conſider whether the Sentiments he makes Uſe of are proper for thoſe Ends. <hi>Homer</hi> is cenſured by the Criticks for his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0106100100:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Defect as to this Particular in ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> tho' at the ſame Time thoſe who have treated this great Poet with Candour, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed this Defect to the Times in which he lived. It was the Fault of the Age, and not of <hi>Homer,</hi> if there wants that Delicacy in ſome of his Sentiments, which now appears in the Works of Men of a much inferior Genius. Beſides, if there are Blemiſhes in any particular Thoughts, there is an infinite Beauty in the greateſt Part of them. In ſhort, if there are many Poets who would not have fallen into the Meanneſs of ſome of his Sentiments, there are none who could have riſen up to the Greatneſs of others. <hi>Virgil</hi> has excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all others in the Propriety of his Sentiments. <hi>Milton</hi> ſhines likewiſe very much in this Particular: Nor muſt me omit one Conſideration which adds to his Honour and Reputation. <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> introduced Perſons whoſe Characters are commonly known among Men, and ſuch as are to be met with either in Hiſtory, or in ordinary Converſation. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Characters, moſt of them, lie out of Nature, and were to be formed purely by his own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It ſhews a greater Genius in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> to have drawn his <hi>Calyban,</hi> than this <hi>Hotſpur</hi> or <hi>Julius Caeſar:</hi> The one was to be ſupplied out of his own Imagination, whereas the other might have been formed upon Tradition, Hiſtory and Obſervation. It was much eaſier therefore for <hi>Homer</hi> to find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sentiments for an Aſſembly of <hi>Grecian</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, than for <hi>Milton</hi> to diverſifie his infernal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with proper Characters, and inſpire them with a Variety of Sentiments. The Loves of <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> are only Copies of what has paſſed between other Perſons. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before the Fall, are a different Species from that of Mankind, who are deſcended from them; and none but a Poet of the moſt unbounded Invention, and the moſt exqu ſite
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0106100100:16"/>
Judgment, cou'd have filled their Converſation and Behaviour with ſo many apt Circumſtances during their State of Innocence.</p>
            <p>NOR is it ſufficient for an Epic Poem to be filled with ſuch Thoughts as are <hi>natural,</hi> unleſs it abound alſo with ſuch as are <hi>ſublime. Virgil</hi> in this Particular falls ſhort of <hi>Homer.</hi> He has not indeed ſo many Thoughts that are low and vulgar; but at the ſame Time has not ſo many Thoughts that are ſublime and noble. The Truth of it is, <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeldom riſes into very aſtoniſhing Sentiments, where he is not fired by the <hi>Iliad.</hi> He every where charms and pleaſes us by the Force of his own Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; but ſeldom elevates and tranſports us where he does not fetch his Hints from <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON</hi>'s chief Talent, and indeed his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Excellence lies in the Sublimity of his Thoughts. There are others of the Moderns who rival him in every other Part of Poetry; but in the Greatneſs of his Sentiments he triumphs over all the Poets both Modern and Ancient, <hi>Homer</hi> only excepted. It is impoſſible for the Imagination of Man  to diſtend it ſelf with greater Ideas, than thoſe which he has laid together in his firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and ſixth Books. The ſeventh, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Creation of the World, is likewiſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſublime, tho' not ſo apt to ſtir up Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Mind of the Reader, nor conſequently ſo perfect in the Epic Way of Writing, becauſe it is filled with leſs Action. Let the judicious Reader compare what <hi>Longinus</hi> has obſerved on ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in <hi>Homer,</hi> and he will find Parallels for moſt of them in the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid we may infer, that as there are two Kinds of Sentiments, the Natural and the Sublime, which are always to be purſued in an heroic Poem, there are alſo two Kinds of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0106100100:17"/>
Thoughts which are carefully to be avoided. The firſt are ſuch as are affected and unnatural; the ſecond ſuch as are mean and vulgar. As for the firſt Kind of Thoughts we meet with little or Nothing that is like them in <hi>Virgil:</hi> He has none of thoſe trifling Points and Puerilities that are ſo often to be met with in <hi>Ovid,</hi> none of the Epigrammatick Turns of <hi>Lucan,</hi> none of thoſe ſwelling Sentiments which are ſo frequently in <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Claudian,</hi> none of thoſe mixed Embelliſhments of <hi>Taſſo.</hi> Every Thing is juſt and natural. His Sentiments ſhew that he had a perfect Inſight into humane Nature, and that he knew every Thing which was the moſt proper to affect it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has in ſome Places, which I may hereafter take Notice of, miſrepreſented <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Way of Thinking as to this Particular, in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he has given us of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Homer</hi> any where falls into the Faults abovementioned, which were indeed the falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements of later Ages. <hi>Milton,</hi> it muſt be confeſt, has ſometimes erred in this Reſpect, as I ſhall ſhew more at large in another Paper; tho' conſidering all the Poets of the Age in which he writ, were infected with this wrong Way of Thinking, he is rather to be admired that he did not give more into it, than that he did ſometimes comply with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Taſte which ſtill prevails ſo much among modern Writers.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince ſeveral Thoughts may be natural which are low and groveling, an Epic Poet ſhould not only avoid ſuch Sentiments as are unnatural or affected, but alſo ſuch as are mean and vulgar. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> has opened a great Field of Raillery to Men of more Delicacy than Greatneſs of Genius, by the Homelineſs of ſome of his Sentiments. But, as I have before ſaid, theſe are rather to be imputed to the Simplicity of the Age in which he lived, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0106100100:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which I may alſo add, of that which he deſcribed, than to any Imperfection in that Divine Poet. <hi>Zoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> among the Ancients, and Monſieur <hi>Perrault,</hi> among the Moderns, puſhed their Ridicule very far upon him, on Account of ſome ſuch Sentiments. There is no Blemiſh to be obſerved in <hi>Virgil,</hi> under this Head, and but a very few in <hi>Milton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall give but one Inſtance of this Impropriety of Thought in <hi>Homer,</hi> and at the ſame Time compare it with an Inſtance of the ſame Nature, both in <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Milton.</hi> Sentiments which raiſe Laughter, can very ſeldom be admitted with any Decency into an heroic Poem, whoſe Buſineſs is to excite Paſſions of a much nobler Nature. <hi>Homer,</hi> however, in his Characters of <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Therſites,</hi> in his Story of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> in his Behaviour of <hi>Irus,</hi> and in other Paſſages, has been obſerved to have lapſed into the Burleſque Character, and to have departed from that ſerious Air which ſeems eſſential to the Magnificence of an Epic Poem. I remember but one Laugh in the whole <hi>Aeneid,</hi> which riſes in the fifth Book upon <hi>Monoetes,</hi> where he is repreſented as thrown overboard, and drying himſelf upon a Rock. But this Piece of Mirth is ſo well timed, that the ſevereſt Critick can have Nothing to ſay againſt it, for it is in the Book of Games and Diverſions, where the Reader's Mind may be ſuppoſed to be ſufficiently relaxed for ſuch an Entertainment. The only Piece of Pleaſantry in <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> is where the evil Spirits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as rallying the Angels upon the Succeſs of their new invented Artillery. This Paſſage I look upon to be the moſt exceptionable in the whole Poem, as being nothing elſe but a String of Puns, and thoſe too very indifferent. <q>

            <p>IT is requiſite that the Language of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Poem ſhould be both Perſpicuous and Sublime. In Proportion as either of theſe two Qualities are wanting, the Language is imperfect. Perſpicuity is the firſt and moſt neceſſary Qualification; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a good-natur'd Reader ſometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks a little Slip even in the Grammer or Syntax, where it is impoſſible for him to miſtake the Poet's Senſe. Of this kind is that Paſſage in <hi>Milton,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſpeaks of <hi>Satan.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <l>—God and his Son except,</l>
                  <l>Created thing nought valu'd he nor ſhunn'd.</l>
               </q> And that in which he deſcribes <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> the goodlieſt Man of Men ſince born</l>
                  <l>His Sons, the faireſt of her Daughters <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is plain, that in the former of theſe Paſſages, according to the natural Syntax, the Divine Perſons mentioned in the firſt Line are repreſented as creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beings; and that in the other, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> are confounded with their Sons and Daughters. Such little Blemiſhes are theſe, when the Thought is great and natural, we ſhould, with <hi>Horace,</hi> impute to a pardonable Inadvertency, or to the Weakneſs of Human Nature, which cannot attend to each minute Particular, and give the laſt finiſhing to every Circumſtance in ſo long a Work. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Criticks therefore, who were acted by a Spirit of Candour, rather than that of Cavilling, invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain Figures of Speech, on purpoſe to palliate little Errors of this Nature in the Writings of thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0106100100:21"/>
Authors who had ſo many greater Beauties to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone for them.</p>
            <p>IF Clearneſs and Perſpicuity were only to be conſulted, the Poet would have nothing elſe to do but to cloath his Thoughts in the moſt plain and natural Expreſſions. But ſince it often happens that the moſt obvious Phraſes, and thoſe which are uſed in ordinary Converſation, become too familiar to the Ear, and contract a kind of Meanneſs by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Mouths of the Vulgar, a Poet ſhould take particular Care to guard himſelf againſt Idiomatick Ways of ſpeaking. <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Lucan</hi> have many Poorneſſes of Expreſſion upon this account, as taking up with the firſt Phraſes that offered, without putting themſelves to the Trouble of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after ſuch as would not only be natural, but alſo elevated and ſublime. <hi>Milton</hi> has but a few Failings in this kind, of which, however, you may meet with ſome Inſtances, as in the following Paſſages. <q>
                  <l>Embrio's and Idiots, Eremites and Fryars</l>
                  <l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Here Pilgrims roam—</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>—A while Diſcourſe they hold,</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>Our Author—</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Who of all Ages to ſucceed, but feeling</l>
                  <l>The Evil on him brought by me, will curſe</l>
                  <l>My Head, ill fare our Anceſtor impure,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>For this we may thank</hi> Adam—</l>
               </q> The great Maſters in Compoſition know very well that many an elegant Phraſe becomes improper for a Poet or an Orator, when it has been debaſed by common Uſe. For this Reaſon the Works of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors, which are written in dead Languages, have a great Advantage over thoſe which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Languages that are now ſpoken. Were there any Mean Phraſes or Idioms in <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0106100100:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they would not ſhock the Ear of the moſt delicate Modern Reader, ſo much as they would have done that of an old <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> becauſe we never hear them pronounced in our Streets, or in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Converſation.</p>
            <p>IT is not therefore ſufficient, that the Language of an Epic Poem be Perſpicuous, unleſs it be alſo Sublime. To this End it ought to deviate from the common Forms and ordinary Phraſes of Speech. The Judgment of a Poet very much diſcovers it ſelf in ſhunning the common Roads of Expreſſion, without falling into ſuch ways of Speech as may ſeem ſtiff and unnatural; he muſt not ſwell into a falſe Sublime, by endeavouring to avoid the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream. Among the <hi>Greeks, Aeſchylus,</hi> and ſome times <hi>Sophocles</hi> were guilty of this Fault; among the <hi>Latins, Claudian</hi> and <hi>Statius;</hi> and among our own Countrymen, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Lee.</hi> In theſe Authors the Affectation of Greatneſs often hurts the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of the Stile, as in many others the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after Perſpicuity prejudices its Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> has obſerved, that the Idioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Stile may be avoided, and the Sublime formed, by the following Methods. Firſt, by the Uſe of Metaphors: ſuch are thoſe in <hi>Milton.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Imparadiſed</hi> in anothers Arms,</l>
                  <l>—And in his Hand a Reed</l>
                  <l>Stood waving <hi>tipt</hi> with Fire;—</l>
                  <l>The graſſie Clods now <hi>calv'd.</hi>—</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Spangled</hi> with Eyes—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IN theſe and innumerable other Inſtances, the Metaphors are very bold but juſt; I muſt however obſerve, that the Metaphors are not thick ſown in <hi>Milton,</hi> which always favours too much of Wit; that they never claſh with one another, which, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves, turns a Sentence into a Kind of an Enigma or Riddle; and that he ſeldom has
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0106100100:23"/>
Recourſe to them where the proper and natural Words will do as well.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER way of raiſing the Language, and giving it a Poetical Turn, is to make Uſe of the Idioms of other Tongues. <hi>Virgil</hi> is full of the <hi>Greek</hi> Forms of Speech, which the Criticks call <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> in his Odes abounds with them much more than <hi>Virgil.</hi> I need not mention the ſeveral Dialects which <hi>Homer</hi> has made uſe of for this End. <hi>Milton</hi> in Conformity with the Practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets, and with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Rule, has infuſed a great many <hi>Latiniſms</hi> as well as <hi>Graciſms,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Hebraiſms,</hi> into the Language of his Poem; as towards the Beginning of it, <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Nor</hi> did they <hi>not</hi> perceive the evil plight</l>
                  <l>In which they were, <hi>or</hi> the fierce Pains <hi>not</hi> feel.</l>
                  <l>Yet <hi>to</hi> their Gen'ral's Voice they ſoon obey'd.</l>
                  <l>—Who ſhall tempt with wandring Fees</l>
                  <l>The dark unbottom'd Infinite Abyſs,</l>
                  <l>And through the <hi>palpable Obſcure</hi> find out</l>
                  <l>His uncouth way, or ſpread his airy Flight</l>
                  <l>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pborn with indefatigable Wings</l>
                  <l>Over the vaſt <hi>Abrupt!</hi>
                  </l>
               </q> 
               <q>
                  <l>—So both aſcend</l>
                  <l>In the Viſions of God—</l>
                  <bibl>B. 11.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER this Head may be reckoned the placing the Adjective after the Subſtantive, the Tranſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Words, the turning the Adjective into a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive, with ſeveral other Foreign Modes of Speech, which this Poet has naturalized to give his Verſe the greater Sound, and throw it out of Proſe.</p>
            <p>THE third Method mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is what agrees with the Genius of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language more than with that of any other Tongue, and is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0106100100:24"/>
therefore more uſed by <hi>Homer</hi> than by any other Poet. I mean the lengthning of a Phraſe by the Addition of Words, which may either be inſerted or omitted, as alſo by the extending or contracting of particular Words by the Inſertion or Omiſſion of certain Syllables. <hi>Milton</hi> has put in practice this Method of raiſing his Language, as far as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Tongue will permit, as in the Paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, <hi>Eremite,</hi> for what is Hermite, in common Diſcourſe. If you obſerve the Meaſure of his Verſe, he has with great Judgment ſuppreſſed a Syllable in ſeveral Words, and ſhortned thoſe of two Syllables into one, by which Method, beſides the above-mentioned Advantage, he has given a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Variety to his Numbers. But this Practice is more particularly remarkable in the Names of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and of Countries, as <hi>Beëlzebub, Heſſebon,</hi> and in many other Particulars, wherein he has either changed the Name, or made uſe of that which is not the moſt commonly known, that he might the better depart from the Language of the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>THE ſame Reaſon recommended to him ſeveral old Words, which alſo makes his Poem appear the more venerable, and gives it a greater Air of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe take notice, that there are in <hi>Milton</hi> ſeveral Words of his own Coining, as <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berean, miſcreated, hell-doom'd, Embryon</hi> Atoms, and many others. If the Reader is offended at this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet, I would recommend him to a Diſcourſe in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which ſhews us how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Homer</hi> has made uſe of the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON</hi> by the above-mentioned Helps, and by the Choice of the nobleſt Words and Phraſes which our Tongue would afford him, has carried our Language to a greater height than any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets have ever done before or after him,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0106100100:25"/>
and made the Sublimity of his Stile equal to that of his Sentiments,</p>
            <p>I have been the more particular in theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Stile,</hi> becauſe it is that part of him in which he appears the moſt ſingular. The Remarks I have here made upon the Practice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poets, with my Obſervations out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> will perhaps alleviate the Prejudice which ſome have taken to his Poem upon this Account; tho' after all, I muſt confeſs, that I think his Stile, tho' ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in general, is in ſome places too much ſtiffened and obſcured by the frequent Uſe of thoſe Methods, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has preſcribed for the raiſing of it.</p>
            <p>THIS Redundancy of thoſe ſeveral Ways of Speech which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>foreign Language,</hi> and with which <hi>Milton</hi> has ſo very much enriched, and in ſome places darkned the Language of his Poem, was the more proper for his uſe, becauſe his Poem is written in Blank Verſe. Rhyme, without any other Aſſiſtance, throws the Language off from Proſe, and very often makes an indifferent Phraſe paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded; but where the Verſe is not built upon Rhymes, there Pomp of Sound, and Energy of Expreſſion, are indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſupport the Stile, and keep it from falling into the Flatneſs of Proſe.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have not a Taſte for this Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Stile, and are apt to ridicule a Poet when he goes out of the common Forms of Expreſſion, would do well to ſee how <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has treated an Ancient Author, called <hi>Euclid,</hi> for his inſipid Mirth upon this Occaſion. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> uſed to call this ſort of Men his Proſe-Criticks.</p>
            <p>I ſhould, under this Head of the Language, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Milton</hi>'s Numbers, in which he has made uſe of ſeveral Eliſions, that are not cuſtomary among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets, as may be particularly obſerved
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0106100100:26"/>
in his cutting off the Letter <hi>Y,</hi> when it precedes a Vowel. This, and ſome other Innovations in the Meaſure of his Verſe, has varied his Numbers, in ſuch a manner, as makes them incapable of ſatiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ear and cloying the Reader, which the ſame uniform Meaſure would certainly have done, and which the perpetual Returns of Rhyme never fail to do in long Narrative Poems. I ſhall cloſe theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Language of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> with obſerving that <hi>Milton</hi> has copied after <hi>Homer,</hi> rather than <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the length of his Periods, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſneſs of his Phraſes, and the running of his Verſes into one another.</p>

            <p>I Have now conſider'd <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> under thoſe four great Heads of the Fable, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, the Sentiments, and the Language; and have ſhewn that he excels, in general, under each of theſe Heads. I hope that I have made ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries which may appear new, even to thoſe who are verſed in Critical Learning. Were I indeed to chuſe my Readers, by whoſe Judgment I would ſtand or fall, they ſhould not be ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted only with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Criticks, but alſo with the Antient and Modern who have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0106100100:27"/>
written in either of the learned Languages. Above all, I would have them well verſed in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, without which a Man very often fancies that he underſtands a Critick, when in reality he does not comprehend his Meaning.</p>
            <p>IT is in Criticiſm, as in all other Sciences and Speculations; one who brings with him any impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eit Notions and Obſervations which he has made in his reading of the Poets, will find his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections methodized and explained, and perhaps ſeveral little Hints that had paſſed in his Mind, perfected and improved in the Works of a good Critick; whereas one who has not theſe previous Lights, is very often an utter Stranger to what he reads, and apt to put a wrong Interpretation upon it.</p>
            <p>NOR is it ſufficient, that a Man who ſets up for a Judge in Criticiſm, ſhould have peruſed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors above-mentioned, unleſs he has alſo a clear and logical Head. Without this Talent he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually puzzled and perplexed amidſt his own Blunders, miſtakes the Senſe of thoſe he would confute, or if he chances to think right, does not know how to convey his Thoughts to another with Clearneſs and Perſpicuity. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who was the beſt Critick, was alſo one of the beſt Logicians that ever appeared in the World.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Eſſay on Human Underſtanding would be thought a very odd Book for a Man to make himſelf Maſter of, who would get a Reputation by Critical Writings; though at the ſame Time it is very certain, that an Author who has not learned the Art of diſtinguiſhing between Words and Things, and of ranging his Thoughts, and ſetting them in proper Lights, whatever Notions he may have, will loſe himſelf in Confuſion and Obſcurity. I might further obſerve, that there is not a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0106100100:28"/>
Critick who has not ſhewn, even in the Stile of his Criticiſms, that he was a Maſter of all the Elegance and Delicacy of his Native Tongue.</p>
            <p>THE Truth of it is, there is nothing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than for a Man to ſet up for a Critick, without a good Inſight into all the Parts of Learning; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many of thoſe who have endeavoured to ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize themſelves by Works of this Nature among our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers, are not only defective in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Particulars, but plainly diſcover by the Phraſes which they make uſe of, and by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed way of thinking, that they are not acquainted with the moſt common and ordinary Syſtems of Arts and Sciences. A few general Rules extracted out of the <hi>French</hi> Authors, with a certain Cant of Words, has ſometimes ſet up an illiterate heavy Writer for a moſt judicious and formidable Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
            <p>ONE great Mark, by which you may diſcovet a Critick who has neither Taſte nor Learning, is this, that he ſeldom ventures to praiſe any Paſſage in an Author which has not been before received and applauded by the Publick, and that his Criticiſm turns wholly upon little Faults and Errors. This Part of a Critick is ſo very eaſy to ſucceed in, that we find every ordinary Reader, upon the publiſhing of a new Poem, has Wit and Ill-nature enough to turn ſeveral Paſſages of it into Ridicule, and very often in the right Place. This Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeably remarked in thoſe two celebrated Lines, <q>
                  <l>Errors, like Straws, upon the Surface flow;</l>
                  <l>He who would ſearch for Pearls muſt dive below.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A true Critick ought to dwell rather upon Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies than Imperfections, to diſcover the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beauties of a Writer, and communicate to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0106100100:29"/>
World ſuch Things as are worth their Obſervation. The moſt exquiſite Words and fineſt Strokes of an Author are thoſe which very often appear the moſt doubtful and exceptionable, to a Man who wants a Reliſh for polite Learning; and they are theſe, which a ſoure undiſtinguiſhing Critick generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks with the greateſt Violence. <hi>Tully</hi> obſerves, that it is very eaſy to brand or fix a Mark upon what he calls <hi>Verbum ardens,</hi> or, as it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into <hi>Engliſh, a glowing bold Expreſſion,</hi> and to turn it into Ridicule by a cold ill-natured Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm. A little Wit is equally capable of expoſing a Beauty, and of aggravating a Fault; and though ſuch a Treatment of an Author naturally produces Indignation in the Mind of an underſtanding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it has however its Effect among the Generality of thoſe whoſe Hands it falls into, the Rabble of Mankind being very apt to think that every thing which is laughed at with any Mixture of Wit, is ridiculous in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>SUCH a Mirth as this, is always unſeaſonable in a Critick, as it rather prejudices the Reader than convinces him, and is capable of making a Beauty, as well as a Blemiſh, the Subject of Deriſion. A Man, who cannot write with Wit on a proper Subject, is dull and ſtupid, but one who ſhews it in an improper Place, is as impertinent and abſurd. Beſides, a Man who has the Gift of Ridicule, is apt to find Fault with any Thing that gives him an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of exerting his beloved Talent, and very often cenſures a Paſſage, not becauſe there is any Fault in it, but becauſe he can be merry upon it. Such Kinds of Pleaſantry are very unfair and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous in Works of Criticiſm, in which the greateſt Maſters, both antient and modern, have always appeared with a ſerious and inſtructive Air.</p>
            <p>AS I intend in my next Paper to ſhew the Defects in <hi>Milton's Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> I thought fit to premiſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0106100100:30"/>
theſe few Particulars, to the End that the Reader may know I enter upon it, as on a very ungrateful Work, and that I ſhall juſt point at the Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, without endeavouring to enflame them with Ridicule. I muſt alſo obſerve with <hi>Longinus,</hi> that the Productions of a great Genius, with many Lapſes and Inadvertencies, are infinitely preferable to the Works of an inferior Kind of Author, which are ſcrupulouſly exact and conformable to all the Rules of correct Writing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude my Paper with a Story out of <hi>Boccalini,</hi> which ſufficiently ſhews us the Opinion that judicious Author entertained of the Sort of Criticks I have been here mentioning. A famous Critick, ſays he, having gathered together all the Faults of an eminent Poet, made a Preſent of them to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> who received them very graciouſly, and reſolved to make the Author a ſuitable Return for the Trouble he had been at in collecting them. In Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, he ſet before him a Sack of Wheat, as it had been juſt threſhed out of the Sheaf. He then bid him pick out the Chaff from among the Corn, and lay it aſide by itſelf. The Critick applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Task with great Induſtry and Pleaſure, and after having made the due Separation, was preſented by <hi>Apollo</hi> with the Chaff for his Pains.</p>

            <p>AFTER what I have ſaid in my laſt <hi>Saturday</hi>'s Paper, I ſhall enter on the Subject of this without farther Preface, and remark the ſeveral Defects which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0106100100:31"/>
appear in the Fable, the Characters, the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Language of <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt;</hi> not doubting but the Reader will pardon me, if I alledge at the ſame Time whatever may be ſaid for the Extenuation of ſuch Defects. The firſt Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which I ſhall obſerve in the Fable is, that the Event of it is unhappy.</p>
            <p>THE Fable of every Poem is according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatle</hi>'s Diviſion either <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Implex.</hi> It is called Simple when there is no Change of Fortune in it, Implex when the Fortune of the chief Actor changes from Bad to Good, or from Good to Bad. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Fable is thought the moſt perfect; I ſuppoſe, becauſe it is more proper to ſtir up the Paſſions of the Reader, and to ſurprize him with a greater Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Accidents.</p>
            <p>THE Implex Fable is therefore of two Kinds: In the firſt the chief Actor makes his Way through a long Series of Dangers and Difficulties, 'till he arrives at Honour and Proſperity, as we ſee in the Story of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes.</hi> In the ſecond, the chief Actor in the Poem falls from ſome eminent Pitch of Honour and Proſperity, into Miſery and Diſgrace. Thus we ſee <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſinking from a State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Happineſs, into the moſt abject Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Sin and Sorrow.</p>
            <p>THE moſt taking Tragedies among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients were built on this laſt Sort of Implex Fable, particularly the Tragedy of <hi>OEdipus,</hi> which proceeds upon a Story, if we may believe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the moſt proper for Tragedy that could be invented by the Wit of Man. I have taken ſome Pains in a former Paper to ſhew, that this Kind of Implex Fable, wherein the Event is unhappy, is more apt to affect an Audience than that of the firſt Kind; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many excellent Pieces among the Antients, as well as moſt of thoſe which have been written of late Years in our own Country, are raiſed upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0106100100:32"/>
contrary Plans. I muſt however own, that I think this Kind of Fable, which is the moſt perfect in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, is not ſo proper for an Heroick Poem.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON</hi> ſeems to have been ſenſible of this Imperfection in his Fable, and has therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to cure it by ſeveral Expedients; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Mortification which the great Adverſary of Mankind meets with upon his Return to the Aſſembly of Infernal Spirits, as it is deſcribed in a beautiful Paſſage of the tenth Book; and likewiſe by the Viſion, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> at the Cloſe of the Poem ſees his Off-ſpring triumphing over his great Enemy, and himſelf reſtored to a happier <hi>Paradiſe</hi> than that from which he fell.</p>
            <p>THERE is another Objection againſt <hi>Milton</hi>'s Fable, which is indeed almoſt the ſame with the former, tho' placed in a different Light, namely, That the Hero in the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> is unſucceſsful, and by no Means a Match for his Enemies. This gave Occaſion to Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Reflection, that the Devil was in reality <hi>Milton</hi>'s Hero. I think I have obviated this Objection in my firſt Paper. The <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe Loſt</hi> is an Epic, or a Narrative Poem, and he that looks for an Hero in it, ſearches for that which <hi>Milton</hi> never intended; but if he will needs fix the Name of an Hero upon any Perſon in it, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who is the Hero, both in the Principal Action, and in the chief Epiſodes. Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm could not furniſh out a real Action for a Fable greater than that of the <hi>Iliad</hi> or <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Heathen could not form a higher Notion of a Poem than one of that Kind which they call an Heroic. Whether <hi>Milton</hi>'s is not of a ſublimer Nature I will not preſume to determine: It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that I ſhew there is in the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> all the Greatneſs of Plan, Regularity of Deſign, and maſterly Beauties which we diſcover in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0106100100:33"/>
I muſt in the next Place obſerve, that <hi>Milton</hi> has interwoven in the Texture of his Fable ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which do not ſeem to have Probability enough for an Epic Poem, particularly in the Actions which he aſcribes to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and the Picture which he draws of the <hi>Limbo of Vanity,</hi> with other Paſſages in the ſecond Book. Such Allegories rather ſavour of the Spirit of <hi>Spenſer</hi> and <hi>Arioſto,</hi> than of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Structure of his Poem he has likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of too many Digreſſions. It is finely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the Author of an Heroic Poem ſhould ſeldom ſpeak himſelf, but throw as much of his Work as he can into the Mouths of thoſe who are his principal Actors. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has given no Reaſon for this Precept; but I preſume it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mind of the Reader is more awed and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated when he hears <hi>Aeneas</hi> or <hi>Achilles</hi> ſpeak, than when <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Homer</hi> talk in their own Perſons. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that aſſuming the Character of an eminent Man is apt to fire the Imagination, and raiſe the Ideas of the Author. <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, mentioning his Dialogue of old Age, in which <hi>Cato</hi> is the chief Speaker, that upon a Review of it he was agreeably impoſed upon, and fancied that it was <hi>Cato,</hi> and not he himſelf, who uttered his Thoughts on that Subject.</p>
            <p>IF the Reader would be at the Pains to ſee how the Story of the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Aeneid</hi> is delivered by thoſe Perſons who act in it, he will be ſurpriſed to find how little in either of theſe Poems proceeds from the Authors. <hi>Milton</hi> has, in the general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Fable, very finely obſerved this great Rule; inſomuch, that there is ſcarce a third Part of it which comes from the Poet; the reſt is ſpoken either by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> or by ſome Good or Evil Spirit who is engaged either in their Deſtruction or Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0106100100:34"/>
FROM what has been here obſerved, it appears, that Digreſſions are by no Means to be allowed of in an Epic Poem. If the Poet, even in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courſe of his Narration, ſhould ſpeak as little as poſſible, he ſhould certainly never let his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſleep for the ſake of any Reflections of his own. I have often obſerved, with a ſecret Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the longeſt Reflection in the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is in that Paſſage of the Tenth Book, where <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is repreſented as dreſſing himſelf in the Spoils of <hi>Pallas,</hi> whom he had ſlain. <hi>Virgil</hi> here lets his Fable ſtand ſtill for the Sake of the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. <hi>How is the Mind of Man ignorant of Futurity, and unable to bear proſperous Fortune with Moderation? The Time will come when</hi> Turnus <hi>ſhall wiſh that he had left the Body of</hi> Pallas <hi>untouched, and curſe the Day on which he dreſſed himſelf in theſe Spoils.</hi> As the great Event of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and the Death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> whom <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſlew, becauſe he ſaw him adorned with the Spoils of <hi>Pallas,</hi> turns upon this Incident, <hi>Virgil</hi> went out of his Way to make this Reflection upon it, without which ſo ſmall a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance might poſſibly have ſlipped out of his Reader's Memory. <hi>Lucan,</hi> who was an Injudicious Poet, lets drop his Story very frequently for the Sake of his unneceſſary Digreſſions, or his <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticula,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> calls them. If he gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Prodigies which preceded the Civil War, he declaims upon the Occaſion, and ſhews how much happier it would be for Man, if he did not feel his evil Fortune before it comes to paſs, and ſuffer not only by its real Weight, but by the Apprehenſion of it. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Complaint for his Blindneſs, his Panegyrick on Marriage, his Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s going naked, of the Angels eating, and ſeveral other Paſſages in his Poem, are liable to the ſame Exception, tho' I muſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0106100100:35"/>
confeſs there is ſo great a Beauty in theſe very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that I would not with them our of his Poem.</p>
            <p>I have, in a former Paper, ſpoken of the <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi> of <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> and declared my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as to the Allegorical Perſons who are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in it.</p>
            <p>IF we look into the <hi>Sentiments,</hi> I think they are ſometimes defective under the following Heads; Firſt, as there are ſeveral of them too much point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome that degenerate even into Punns. Of this laſt Kind, I am afraid is that in the Firſt Book, where, ſpeaking of the Pigmies, he calls them <q>
                  <l>—The ſmall <hi>Infantry</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Warr'd on by Cranes—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Blemiſh that appears in ſome of his Thoughts, is his frequent Alluſion to Heathen Fables, which are not certainly of a Piece with the Divine Subject, of which he treats. I do not find Fault with theſe Alluſions, where the Poet himſelf repreſents them as fabulous, as he does in ſome Places, but where he mentions them as Truths and Matters of Fact. The Limits of my Paper will not give me Leave to be particular in Inſtances of this Kind: The Reader will eaſily remark them in his Peruſal of the Poem.</p>
            <p>A Third Fault in his Sentiments, is an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Oſtentation of Learning, which likewiſe occurs very frequently. It is certain, that both <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> were Maſters of all the Learning of their Times, but it ſhews itſelf in their Works, after an indirect and concealed Manner. <hi>Milton</hi> ſeems am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of letting us know, by his Excurſions on Free-Will and Predeſtination, and his many Glances upon Hiſtory, Aſtronomy, Geography and the like,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0106100100:36"/>
as well as by the Terms and Phraſes he ſometimes makes Uſe of, that he was acquainted with the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences.</p>
            <p>IF, in the laſt Place, we conſider the <hi>Language</hi> of this great Poet, we muſt allow what I have hinted in a former Paper, that it is often too much labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſometimes obſcured by old Words, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and Foreign Idioms. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Objection to the Stile of a great Author, <hi>Rigot ojus oratio, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil in ea placidum nihil lene,</hi> is what many Criticks make to <hi>Milton:</hi> As I cannot wholly refute it, ſo I have already apologized for it in another Paper; to which I may further add, that <hi>Milton</hi>'s Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ideas were ſo wonderfully ſublime, that it would have been impoſſible for him to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them in their full Strength and Beauty, without having Recourſe to theſe Foreign Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Our Language ſunk under him, and was unequal to that Greatneſs of Soul, which furniſhed him with ſuch glorious Conceptions.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Fault in his Language is, that he often affects a Kind of Jingle in his Words, as in the following Paſſages, and many others: <q>
                  <l>And brought into the <hi>World</hi> a <hi>World of</hi> Woe.</l>
                  <l>—Begirt th' Almighty Throne</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Beſeeching</hi> or <hi>beſieging</hi>—</l>
                  <l>This <hi>tempted</hi> our <hi>Attempt</hi>—</l>
                  <l>At one ſlight <hi>Bound</hi> high over-leapt all <hi>Bound.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I know there are Figures for this Kind of Speech, that ſome of the greateſt Antients have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, and that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf has given it a Place in his Rhetorick among the Beauties of that Art. But as it is in itſelf poor and trifling, it is I think at preſent univerſally exploded by all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of polite Writing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0106100100:37"/>
THE laſt Fault which I ſhall take Notice of in <hi>Milton</hi>'s Stile, is the frequent Uſe of what the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed call <hi>Technical Words,</hi> or Terms of Art. It is one of the great Beauties of Poetry, to make hard Things intelligible, and to deliver what is abſtruſe of it ſelf in ſuch eaſy Language as may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ordinary Readers: Beſides, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Poet ſhould rather ſeem born with him, or inſpired, than drawn from Books and Syſtems. I have often wondered, how Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> could tranſlate a Paſſage out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> after the following Manner, <q>
                  <l>Tack to the Larboard, and ſtand off to Sea,</l>
                  <l>Veer Star-board Sea and Land.—</l>
               </q> 
               <hi>Milton</hi> makes Uſe of <hi>Larboard</hi> in the ſame Manner. When he is upon Building, he mentions <hi>Doric Pillars, Pilaſters, Cornice, Freeze, Architrave.</hi> When he talks of Heavenly Bodies, you meet with <hi>Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptic,</hi> and <hi>Eccentric,</hi> the <hi>Trepidation, Stars dropping from the Zenith, Rays culminating from the Equator.</hi> To which might be added many Inſtances of the like Kind in ſeveral other Arts and Sciences.</p>
            <p>Iſhall in my next Papers give an Account of the many particular Beauties in <hi>Milton,</hi> which would have been too long to inſert under thoſe general Heads I have already treated of, and with which I intend to conclude this Piece of Criticiſm.</p>

            <p>I Have ſeen in the Works of a modern Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, a Map of the Spots in the Sun. My laſt Paper of the Faults and Blemiſhes in <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe Loſt,</hi> may be conſidered as a Piece of the ſame Nature. To purſue the Alluſion: As it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that among the bright Parts of the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Body above-mentioned, there are ſome which glow more intenſely, and dart a ſtronger Light than others; ſo, notwithſtanding I have already ſhewn <hi>Milton</hi>'s Poem to be very beautiful in general, I ſhall now proceed to take Notice of ſuch Beauties as appear to me more exquiſite than the reſt. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> has propoſed the Subject of his Poem in the following Verſes. <q>
                  <l>Of Mans firſt diſobedience, and the fruit</l>
                  <l>Of that forbidden tree whoſe mortal taſte</l>
                  <l>Brought Death into the world and all our woe,</l>
                  <l>With loſs of <hi>Eden,</hi> 'till one greater Man</l>
                  <l>Reſtore us, and regain the bliſsful Seat,</l>
                  <l>Sing Heav'nly Muſe—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Lines are perhaps as plain, ſimple and unadorned as any of the whole Poem, in which Particular the Author has conform'd himſelf to the Example of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Precept of <hi>Horace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS Invocation to a Work which turns in a great Meaſure upon the Creation of the World, is very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0106100100:39"/>
properly made to the Muſe who inſpired <hi>Moſes</hi> in thoſe Books from whence our Author drew his Subject, and to the Holy Spirit who is therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as operating after a particular Manner in the firſt Production of Nature. This whole Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium riſes very happily into noble Language and Sentiment, as I think the Tranſition to the Fable is exquiſitely beautiful and natural.</p>
            <p>THE Nine-days Aſtoniſhment, in which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels lay entranced after their dreadful Overthrow and Fall from Heaven, before they could recover either the Uſe of Thought or Speech, is a noble <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> and very finely imagined.<note place="margin">Vid. Heſiod.</note> The Diviſion of Hell into Seas of Fire, and into firm Ground impregnated with the ſame furious Element, with that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circumſtance of the Excluſion of <hi>Hope</hi> from thoſe infernal Regions, are Inſtances of the ſame great and fruitful Invention.</p>
            <p>THE Thoughts in the firſt Speech and Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Satan,</hi> who is one of the principal Actors in this Poem, are wonderfully proper to give us a full Idea of him. His Pride, Envy and Revenge, Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, Deſpair and Impenitence, are all of them very artfully interwoven. In ſhort, his firſt Speech is a Complication of all thoſe Paſſions which diſcover themſelves ſeparately in ſeveral other of his Speeches in the Poem. The whole Part of this great Enemy of Mankind is filled with ſuch Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as are very apt to raiſe and terrify the Reader's Imagination. Of this Nature, in the Book now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is his being the firſt that awakens out of the general Trance, with his Poſture on the burning Lake, his riſing from it, and the Deſcription of his Shield and Spear. <q>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Satan</hi> talking to his neareſt mate,</l>
                  <l>With head up-life above the wave, and eyes</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0106100100:40"/>
That ſparkling blazed, his other parts beſide</l>
                  <l>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large,</l>
                  <l>Lay floating many a rood—</l>
                  <l>Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool</l>
                  <l>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames</l>
                  <l>Driv'n backward ſlope their pointing Spires, and rowl'd</l>
                  <l>In Billows leave i'th' midſt a horrid vale.</l>
                  <l>Then with expanded Wings he ſteers his flight</l>
                  <l>Aloſt, incumbent on the dusky Air</l>
                  <l>That felt unuſual weight—</l>
                  <l>—His pondrous Shield,</l>
                  <l>Ethereal temper, maſſie, large and round,</l>
                  <l>Behind him caſt; the broad Circumference</l>
                  <l>Hung on his Shoulders like the Moon, whoſe orb</l>

                  <l>At Ev'ning from the top of <hi>Feſole,</hi>

                  <l>Or in <hi>Valdatno</hi> to deſory new Lands,</l>
                  <l>Rivers or Mountains on her ſpotty Globe.</l>
                  <l>His Spear to equal which the talleſt pine</l>
                  <l>Hewn on <hi>Norwegian</hi> Hills to be the Maſt</l>
                  <l>Of ſome great Ammiral, were but a wand,</l>
                  <l>He walk'd with to ſupport uneaſy Steps</l>
                  <l>Over the burning Marl—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>TO which we may add his Call to the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that lay plunged and ſtupified in the Sea of Fire. <q>
                  <l>He call'd ſo loud, that all the hollow deep</l>
                  <l>Of Hell reſounded—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT there is no ſingle Paſſage in the whole Poem worked up to a greater Sublimity, than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Perſon is deſcribed in thoſe celebrated Lines: <q>
                  <l>—He, above the reſt</l>
                  <l>In Shape and Geſture proudly eminent</l>
                  <l>Stood like a Tower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0106100100:41"/>
HIS Sentiments are every way anſwerable to his Character, and ſuitable to a created Being of the moſt exalted and moſt depraved Nature. Such is that in which he takes Poſſeſſion of his Place of Torments. <q>
                  <l>—Hail Horrors, hail</l>
                  <l>Infernal World, and thou profoundeſt Hill</l>

            <p>AMIDST thoſe Impieties which this Enraged Spirit utters in other Places of the Poem, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has taken Care to introduce none that is not big with Abſurdity, and incapable of ſhocking a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Reader; his Words, as the Poet deſcribes them, bearing only a <hi>Semblance of Worth, not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> He is likewiſe with great Art deſcribed as owning his Adverſary to be Almighty. Whatever perverſe Interpetation he puts on the Juſtice, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and other Attributes of the Supreme Being, he frequently confeſſes his Omnipotence, that being the Perfection he was forced to allow him, and the only Conſideration which could ſupport his Pride under the Shame of his Defeat.</p>
            <p>NOR muſt I here omit that beautiful Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his burſting out in Tears, upon his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of thoſe innumerable Spirits whom he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ſame Guilt and Ruin with himſelf. <q>

            <p>THE Catalogue of Evil Spirits has Abundance of Learning in it, and a very agreeable Turn of Poetry, which riſes in a great meaſure from its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Places where they were worſhipped, by thoſe beautiful Marks of Rivers, ſo frequent among the Antient Poets. The Author had doubtleſs in this Place <hi>Homer</hi>'s Catalogue of Ships, and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Lift of Warriors in his view. The Characters of <hi>Moloch</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> prepare the Reader's Mind for their reſpective Speeches and Behaviour in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and ſixth Book. The Account of <hi>Thammuz</hi> is finely Romantick, and ſuitable to what we read among the Antients of the Worſhip which was paid to that Idol. <q>
                  <l>—<hi>Thammuz</hi> came next behind,</l>

            <p>The Reader will pardon me if I inſert as a Note on this beautiful Paſſage, the Account given us by the late ingenious Mr. <hi>Maundrell</hi> of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0106100100:43"/>
Piece of Worſhip, and probably the firſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuch a Superſtition. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'We came to a fair large River—doubtleſs the Antient River <hi>Adonis,</hi> ſo famous for the Idolatrous Rites perform'd here in Lamentation of <hi>Adonis.</hi> We had the Fortune to ſee what may be ſuppoſed to be the Occaſion of that Opinion which <hi>Lucian</hi> relates, concerning this River, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Stream, at certain Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Year, eſpecially about the Feaſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donis,</hi> is of a bloody Colour; which the Heathens looked upon as proceeding from a kind of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in the River for the Death of <hi>Adonis,</hi> who was killed by a wild Boar in the Mountains, out of which this Stream riſes. Something like this we ſaw actually come to paſs; for the Water was ſtain'd to a ſurpriſing redneſs; and, as we obſerv'd in Travelling, had diſcolour'd the Sea a great way into a reddiſh Hue, occaſion'd doubtleſs by a ſort of Minium, or red Earth, waſhed into the River by the violence of the Rain, and not by any ſtain from <hi>Adonis</hi>'s Blood.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Paſſage in the Catalogue, explaining the manner how Spirits transform themſelves by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or Enlargement of their Dimenſions, is introduced with great Judgment, to make way for ſeveral ſurpriſing Accidents in the Sequel of the Poem. There follows one, at the very End of the Firſt Book, which is what the <hi>French</hi> Criticks call <hi>Marvellous,</hi> but at the ſame Time <hi>probable</hi> by reaſon of the Paſſage laſt mentioned. As ſoon as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Palace is finiſhed, we are told the Multitude and Rabble of Spirits immediately ſhrunk them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a ſmall Compaſs, that there might be Room for ſuch a numberleſs Aſſembly in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Hall. But it is the Poet's Refinement upon this Thought, which I moſt admire, and which is indeed very noble in its ſelf. For he tells us, that notwithſtanding the vulgar, among the fallen Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0106100100:44"/>
contracted their Forms, thoſe of the firſt Rank and Dignity ſtill preſerved their natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions. <q>
                  <l>Thus incorporeal Spirits to ſmalleſt Forms</l>
                  <l>Reduc'd their Shapes immenſe, and were at large</l>
                  <l>Though without Number ſtill amidſt the Hall</l>
                  <l>Of that infernal Court. But far within,</l>
                  <l>And in their own Dimenſions like themſelves,</l>
                  <l>The Great Seraphick Lords and Cherubim,</l>
                  <l>In cloſe receſs and ſecret conclave ſate,</l>

            <p>THE Character of <hi>Mammon,</hi> and the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Pandamonium,</hi> are full of Beauties.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral other Strokes in the Firſt Book wonderfully poetical, and Inſtances of that Sublime Genius ſo peculiar to the Author.

            </p>
            <p>THERE are alſo ſeveral noble Similies and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions in the firſt Book of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi> And here I muſt obſerve, that when <hi>Milton</hi> alludes either to Things or Perſons, he never quits his Simile till it riſes to ſome very great Idea, which is often fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the Occaſion that gave Birth to it. The Reſemblance does not, perhaps, laſt above a Line or two, but the Poet runs on with the Hint, till he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0106100100:46"/>
has raiſed out of it ſome glorious Image or Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proper to inflame the Mind of the Reader, and to give it that ſublime Kind of Entertainment, which is ſuitable to the Nature of an Heroic Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em. Thoſe, who are acquainted with <hi>Homer</hi>'s and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Way of Writing, cannot but be pleaſed with this Kind of Structure in <hi>Milton</hi>'s Similitudes. I am the more particular on this Head, becauſe ignorant Readers, who have formed their Taſte upon the quaint Similies, and little Turns of Wit, which are ſo much in Vogue among modern Poets, cannot reliſh theſe Beauties which are of a much higher Nature, and are therefore apt to cenſure <hi>Milton</hi>'s Compariſons, in which they do not ſee any ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Points of Likeneſs. Monſieur <hi>Perrault</hi> was a Man of this vitiated Reliſh, and for that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has endeavoured to turn into Ridicule ſeveral of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Similitudes, which he calls <hi>Comparaiſons a longue queue, Long-tail'd Compariſons.</hi> I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Paper on the Firſt Book of <hi>Milton</hi> with the Anſwer which Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi> makes to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault</hi> on this Occaſion; <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Compariſons, ſays he, in Odes and Epic Poems are not introduced only to illuſtrate and embelliſh the Diſcourſe, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe and relax the Mind of the reader, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſengaging him from too painful an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the principal Subject, and by leading him into other agreeable Images. <hi>Homer,</hi> ſays he, excelled in this Particular, whoſe Compariſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with ſuch Images of Nature as are proper to relieve and diverſifie his Subjects. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually inſtructs the Reader, and makes him take notice, even in Objects which are every Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes, of ſuch Circumſtances as we ſhould not otherwiſe have obſerved. <hi>To this he adds, as a Maxim univerſally acknowledged,</hi> that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Poetry for the Points of the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to correſpond with one another exactly, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0106100100:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that a general Reſemblance is ſufficient, and that too much Nicety in this Particular ſavours of the Rhetorician and Epigrammatiſt.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, if we look into the Conduct of <hi>Homer, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> as the great Fable is the Soul of each Poem, ſo to give their Works an agreeable Variety, their Epiſodes are ſo many ſhort Fables, and their Similes ſo many ſhort Epiſodes; to which you may add, if you pleaſe, that their Metaphors are ſo many ſhort Similes. If the Reader conſiders the Compariſons in the firſt Book of <hi>Milton,</hi> of the Sun in an Eclipſe, of the fleeping <hi>Leviathan,</hi> of the Bees ſwarming about their Hive, of the fairy Dance, in the View wherein I have here placed them, he will eaſily diſcover the great Beauties that are in each of thoſe Paſſages.</p>

Paſſages of the Second Book in this Light. That ſuperior Greatneſs, and Mock-Majeſty, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Prince of the fallen Angels, is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably preſerved in the Beginning of this Book. His opening and cloſing the Debate; his taking on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that great Enterprize at the Thought of which the whole infernal Aſſembly trembled; his encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the hideous Phantom who guarded the Gates of Hell, and appeared to him in all his Terrors; are Inſtances of that proud and daring Mind which could not brook Submiſſion even to Omnipotence. <q>
                  <l>SATAN was now at Hand, and from his Seat</l>
                  <l>The Monſter moving onward came as faſt</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame Boldneſs and Intrepidity of Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our diſcovers it ſelf in the ſeveral Adventures, which he meets with during his Paſſage through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of unformed Matter, and particularly in his Addreſs to thoſe tremendous Powers who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as preſiding over it.</p>
            <p>THE Part of <hi>Moloch</hi> is likewiſe in all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances full of that Fire and Fury, which diſtinguiſh this Spirit from the reſt of the fallen Angels. He is deſcribed in the firſt Book as beſmeared with the Blood of humane Sacrifices, and delighted with the Tears of Parents and the Cries of Children. In the ſecond Book he is marked out as the fierceſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that fought in Heaven; and if we conſider the Figure which he makes in the ſixth Book, where the Battel of the Angels is deſcribed, we find it every Way anſwerable to the ſame furious enraged Character. <q>
                  <l>—Where the might of <hi>Gabriel</hi> fought,</l>
                  <l>And with fierce Enſigns pierc'd the deep array</l>

Of <hi>Molec,</hi> furious King, who him defy'd,</l>
                  <l>And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound</l>
                  <l>Threaten'd, nor from the holy one of Heav'n</l>
                  <l>Refrain'd his Tongue blaſphemous; but anon</l>
                  <l>Down cloven to the waſte, with ſhatter'd arms</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IT may be worth while to obſerve, that <hi>Milton</hi> has repreſented this violent impetuous Spirit, who is hurried on by ſuch precipitate Paſſions, as the <hi>firſt</hi> that riſes in that Aſſembly, to give his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their preſent Poſture of Affairs. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he declares himſelf abruptly for War, and appears incenſed at his Companions, for loſing ſo much Time as even to deliberate upon it. All his Sentiments are raſh, audacious and deſperate. Such is that of arming themſelves with their Tortures, and turning their Puniſhments upon him who infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them. <q>
                  <l>—No, let us rather chuſe,</l>
                  <l>Arm'd with Hell-flames and fury, all at once</l>
                  <l>O'er Heav'ns high tow'rs to force reſiſtleſs Way,</l>
                  <l>Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms</l>
                  <l>Againſt the Tort'rer; when to meet the Noiſe</l>
                  <l>Of his almighty Engine he ſhall hear</l>
                  <l>Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning ſee</l>
                  <l>Black fire and horror ſhot with equal Rage</l>
                  <l>Among his Angels; and his Throne it ſelf</l>
                  <l>Mixt with <hi>Tartarean</hi> Sulphur, and ſtrange Fire,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HIS preferring Annihilation to Shame or Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is alſo highly ſuitable to his Character; as the Comfort he draws from their diſturbing the Peace of Heaven, that if it be not Victory it is Revenge, is a Sentiment truly diabolical, and becoming the Bitterneſs of this implacable Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0106100100:50"/>
               <hi>BELIAL</hi> is deſcribed, in the firſt Book, as the Idol of the lewd and luxurious. He is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, purſuant to that Deſcription, characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed as timorous and ſlothful; and if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſixth Book, we find him celebrated in the Battel of Angels for Nothing but that Scoffing Speech which he makes to <hi>Satan,</hi> on their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Advantage over the Enemy. As his Appearance is uniform, and of a piece in theſe three ſeveral Views, we find his Sentiments in the infernal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly every Way conformable to his Character. Such are his Apprehenſions of a ſecond Battel, his Horrors of Annihilation, his preferring to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable rather than <hi>not to be.</hi> I need not obſerve, that the Contraſt of Thought in this Speech, and that which precedes it, gives an agreeable Variety to the Debate.</p>

               <hi>MAMMON</hi>'s Character is ſo fully drawn in the firſt Book, that the Poet adds Nothing to it in the Second. We were before told, that he was the firſt who taught Mankind to ranſack the Earth for Gold and Silver, and that he was the Architect of <hi>Pandaemonium,</hi> or the infernal Palace, where the evil Spirits were to meet in Council. His Speech in this Book is every where ſuitable to ſo depraved a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. How proper is that Reflection, of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to taſte the Happineſs of Heaven were they actually there, in the Mouth of one, who while he was in Heaven is ſaid to have had his Mind dazled with the outward Pomps and Glories of the Place, and to have been more intent on the Riches of the Pavement, than on the beatifick Viſion. I ſhall alſo leave the Reader to judge how agreeable the following Sentiments are to the ſame Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. <q>

               <hi>BEELZEB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>B,</hi> who is reckon'd the ſecond in Dignity that fell, and is in the firſt Book, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond that awakens out of the Trance, and confers with <hi>Satan</hi> upon the Situation of their Affairs, maintains his Rank in the Book now before us. There is a wonderful Majeſty deſcribed in his riſing up to ſpeak. He acts as a Kind of Moderator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two oppoſite Parties, and propoſes a third Undertaking, which the whole Aſſembly gives into. The Motion he makes of detaching one of their Body in Search of a new World is grounded upon a Project deviſed by <hi>Satan,</hi> and curſorily propoſed by him in the following Lines of the firſt Book. <q>

            </p>
            <p>THE Reader may obſerve how juſt it was, not to omit in the firſt Book the Project upon which the whole Poem turns: As alſo that the Prince of the fall'n Angels was the only proper Perſon to give it Birth, and that he next to him in Dignity was the fitteſt to ſecond and ſupport it.</p>
            <p>THERE is beſides, I think, ſomething wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beautiful, and very apt to affect the Reader's Imagination, in this antient Prophecy or Report in Heaven, concerning the Creation of Man. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſhew more the Dignity of the Species, than this Tradition which ran of them before their Exiſtence. They are repreſented to have been the Talk of Heaven, before they were created. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in compliment to the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth, makes the Heroes of it appear in their State of Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; but <hi>Milton</hi> does a far greater Honour to Mankind in general, as he gives us a Glimpſe of them even before they are in Being.</p>
            <p>THE riſing of this great Aſſembly is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in a very ſublime and poetical Manner. <q>
                  <l>Their riſing all at once was as the ſound</l>

            </p>
            <p>THE Diverſions of the fallen Angels, with the particular Account of their Place of Habitation, are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0106100100:53"/>
deſcribed with great Pregnancy of Thought, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſneſs of Invention. The Diverſions are every way ſuitable to Beings who had Nothing left them but Strength and Knowledge miſapplied. Such are their Contentions at the Race, and in Feats of Arms, with their Entertainment in the following Lines. <q>
                  <l>Others with vaſt <hi>Typhaean</hi> Rage more fell</l>
                  <l>Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air</l>
                  <l>In Whirlwind; Hell ſcarce holds the wild uproar.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THEIR Muſick is employed in celebrating their own criminal Exploits, and their Diſcourſe in ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unfathomable Depths of Fate, Free-will, and Fore-knowledge.</p>
            <p>THE ſeveral Circumſtances in the Deſcription of Hell are finely imagined; as the four Rivers which diſgorge themſelves into the Sea of Fire, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of Cold and Heat, and the River of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion. The monſtrous Animals produced in that infernal World are repreſented by a ſingle Line, which gives us a more horrid Idea of them, than a much longer Deſcription would have done. <q>
                  <l>—Nature breeds,</l>
                  <l>Perverſe, all monſtrous, all prodigious Things,</l>
                  <l>Abominable, inutterable, and <hi>worſe</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Than Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Gorgons, and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Epiſode of the fallen Spirits, and their Place of Habitation, comes in very happily to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend the Mind of the Reader from its Attention to the Debate. An ordinary Poet would indeed have ſpun out ſo many Circumſtances to a great Length, and by that Means have weakned, inſtead of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, the principal Fable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0106100100:54"/>
THE Flight of Satan to the Gates of Hell is finely imaged.</p>
            <p>I have already declared my Opinion of the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory concerning <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> which is however a very finiſhed Piece in its Kind, when it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Part of an Epic Poem. The Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the ſeveral Perſons is contrived with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy. <hi>Sin</hi> is the Daughter of <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> the Offspring of <hi>Sin.</hi> The inceſtuous Mixture between <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> produces thoſe Monſters and Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds which from Time to Time enter into their Mother, and tear the Bowels of her who gave them Birth. Theſe are the Terrors of an evil Conſcience, and the proper Fruits of <hi>Sin,</hi> which naturally riſe from the Apprehenſions of <hi>Death.</hi> This laſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Moral is, I think, clearly intimated in the Speech of <hi>Sin,</hi> where complaining of this her dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iſſue, ſhe adds, <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Before mine Eyes in Oppoſition ſits,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Grim</hi> Death <hi>thy Son and Foe who ſets them on.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And me his Parent would full ſoon devour</l>
                  <l>For want of other Prey, but that he knows</l>
                  <l>His End with mine involv'd—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I need not mention to the Reader the beautiful Circumſtance in the laſt Part of this Quotation. He will likewiſe obſerve how naturally the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned in this Allegory are tempted by one common Intereſt to enter into a Confederacy together, and how properly <hi>Sin</hi> is made the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of Hell, and the only Being that can open the Gates to that World of Tortures.</p>
            <p>THE deſcriptive Part of this Allegory is likewiſe very ſtrong, and full of ſublime Ideas. The Figure of <hi>Death,</hi> the Regal Crown upon his Head, his Menace of <hi>Satan,</hi> his advancing to the Combat, the Outcry at his Birth, are Circumſtances too noble
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0106100100:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be paſt over in Silence, and extreamly ſuitable to this <hi>King of Terrors.</hi> I need not Mention the Juſtneſs of Thought which is obſerved in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of theſe ſeveral Symbolical Perſons, that <hi>Sin</hi> was produced upon the firſt Revolt of <hi>Satan,</hi> that <hi>Death</hi> appeared ſoon after he was caſt into Hell, and that the Terrors of Conſcience were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the Gate of this Place of Torments. The Deſcription of the Gates is very poetical, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of them is full of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Spirit. <q>

            <p>IN Satan's Voyage through the Chaos there are ſeveral imaginary Perſons deſcribed, as reſiding in that immenſe Waſte of Matter. This may perhaps be conformable to the Taſte of thoſe Criticks who are pleaſed with Nothing in a Poet which has not Life and Manners aſcribed to it; but for my own Part, I am pleaſed moſt with thoſe Paſſages in this Deſcription which carry in them a greater Meaſure of Probability, and are ſuch as might poſſibly have happened. Of this Kind is his firſt Mounting in the Smoak, that riſes from the infernal Pit, his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a Cloud of Nitre, and the like combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Materials, that by their Exploſion ſtill hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him forward in his Voyage; his ſpringing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward like a Pyramid of Fire, with his laborious

Paſſage through that Confuſion of Elements, which the Poet calls <q>

            <p>HAVING in the Firſt and Second Book repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Infernal World with all its Horrours, the Thread of his Fable naturally leads him into the oppoſite Regions of Bliſs and Glory,</p>

IF <hi>Milton</hi>'s Majeſty forſakes him any where, it is in thoſe Parts of his Poem, where the Divine Perſons are introduced as Speakers. One may, I think, obſerve that the Author proceeds with a Kind of Fear and Trembling, whilſt he deſcribes the Sentiments of the Almighty. He dares not give his Imagination its full Play, but chuſes to confine himſelf to ſuch Thoughts as are drawn from the Books of the moſt Orthodox Divines, and to ſuch Expreſſions as may be met with in Scripture. The Beauties, therefore, which we are to look for in theſe Speeches, are not of a poetical Nature, nor ſo proper to fill the Mind with Sentiments of Grandeur, as with Thoughts of Devotion. The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which they are deſigned to raiſe, are a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love and Religious Fear. The particular Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Speeches in the Third Book, conſiſts in that Shortneſs and Perſpicuity of Stile, in which the Poet has couched the greateſt Myſteries of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and drawn together, in a regular Scheme, the whole Diſpenſation of Providence, with reſpect to Man. He has repreſented all the abſtruſe Doctrines of Predeſtination, Free-Will and Grace, as alſo the great Points of Incarnation and Redemption, (which naturally grow up in a Poem that treats of the Fall of Man,) with great Energy of Expreſſion, and in a clearer and ſtronger Light than I ever met with in any other Writer. As theſe Points are dry in themſelves to the Generality of Readers, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and clear Manner in which he has treated them is very much to be admired, as is likewiſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Art which he has made uſe of, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſing of all thoſe Graces of Poetry, which the Subject was capable of receiving.</p>
            <p>THE Survey of the whole Creation, and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing that is tranſacted in it, is a Proſpect wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Omniſcience; and as much above that, in which <hi>Virgil</hi> has drawn his <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as the Chriſtian
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0106100100:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Idea of the Supream Being is more Rational and Sublime than that of the Heathens. The particular Objects on which he is deſcribed to have caſt his Eye, are repreſented in the moſt beautiful and lively Manner. <q>

                  <l>No ſooner had th' Almighty ceas'd, but all</l>
                  <l>The multitudes of Angels with a ſhout,</l>
                  <l>Loud as from Numbers without Number, ſweet</l>
                  <l>As from bleſt Voices utt'ring Joy, Heav'n rung</l>
                  <l>With Jubilee, and loud Hoſanna's fill'd</l>

            <p>
               <hi>SATAN</hi>'s Walk upon the Outſide of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, which, at a Diſtance appeared to him of a Globular Form, but, upon his nearer Approach, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like an unbounded Plain, is natural and noble. As his Roaming upon the Frontiers of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between that Maſs of Matter, which was wrought into a World, and that ſhapeleſs unformed Heap of Materials, which ſtill lay in Chaos and Confuſion, ſtrikes the Imagination with ſomething aſtoniſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great and wild. I have before ſpoken of the <hi>Limbo of Vanity,</hi> which the Poet places upon this outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Surface of the Univerſe, and ſhall here explain
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0106100100:60"/>
my ſelf more at large on that, and other Parts of the Poem, which are of the ſame ſhadowy Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> obſerves, that the Fable of an Epic Poem ſhould abound in Circumſtances that are both credible and aſtoniſhing; or, as the <hi>French</hi> Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks chuſe to phraſe it, the Fable ſhould be filled with the Probable and the Marvellous. This Rule is as fine and juſt as any in <hi>Ariſtole</hi>'s whole Art of Poetry.</p>
            <p>IF the Fable is only probable, it differs Nothing from a true Hiſtory; if it is only marvellous, it is no better than a Romance. The great Secret there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Heroick Poetry, is to relate ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as may produce in the Reader at the ſame Time both Belief and Aſtoniſhment. This is brought to paſs in a <hi>well choſen</hi> Fable, by the Account of ſuch Things as have really happened, or at leaſt of ſuch Things as have happened according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinions of Mankind. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Fable is a Maſter-piece of this Nature; as the War in Heaven, the Condition of the fallen Angels, the State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, the Temptation of the Serpent, and the Fall of Man, though they are very aſtoniſhing in themſelves, are not only credible, but actual Points of Faith.</p>
            <p>THE next Method of reconciling Miracles with Credibility, is by a happy Invention of the Poet; as in particular, when he introduces Agents of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Nature, who are capable of effecting what is wonderful, and what is not to be met with in the ordinary Courſe of Things. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi>'s Ship being turn'd into a Rock, and <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Fleet into a Shoal of Water Nymphs, though they are very ſurpriſing Accidents, are nevertheleſs probable, when we are told that they were the Gods who thus transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. It is this Kind of Machinery which fills the Poems both of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> with ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as are wonderful, but not impoſſible, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0106100100:61"/>
ſo frequently produce in the Reader the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Paſſion that can riſe in the Mind of Man, which is Admiration. If there be any Inſtance in the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid</hi> liable to Exception upon this Account, it is in the Beginning of the Third Book, where <hi>Aeneas</hi> is repreſented as tearing up the Myrtle that dropped Blood. To qualifie this wonderful Circumſtance, <hi>Polydorus</hi> tells a Story from the Root of the Myrtle, that the barbarous Inhabitants of the Country ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pierced him with Spears and Arrows, the Wood which was left in his Body took Root in his Wounds, and gave Birth to that bleeding Tree. This Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſeems to have the Marvellous without the Probable, becauſe it is repreſented as proceeding from natural Cauſes, without the Interpoſition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God, or rather ſupernatural Power capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it: The Spears and Arrows grow of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without ſo much as the modern Help of an Enchantment. If we look into the Fiction of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Fable, though we find it full of ſurpriſing Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, they are generally ſuited to our Notions of the Things and Perſons deſcribed, and tempered with a due Meaſure of Probability. I muſt only make an Exception to the <hi>Limbo of Vanity,</hi> with his Epiſode of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and ſome of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Perſons in his <hi>Chaos.</hi> Theſe Paſſages are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing, but not credible; the Reader cannot ſo far impoſe upon himſelf as to ſee a Poſſibility in them; they are the Deſcription of Dreams and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, not of Things or Perſons. I know that many Criticks look upon the Stories of <hi>Circe, Polyphemt,</hi> the <hi>Sirens,</hi> nay the whole <hi>Odiſſey</hi> and <hi>Iliad</hi> to be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories; but allowing this to be true, they are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which conſidering the Opinions of Mankind that prevailed in the Age of the Poets, might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have been according to the Letter. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſuch as might have acted what is aſcribed to them, as the Circumſtances, in which they are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0106100100:62"/>
repreſented, might poſſibly have been Truths and Realities. This Appearance of Probability is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requiſite in the greater Kinds of Poetry, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves the ancient Tragick Writers made uſe of the Names of ſuch great Men as had actually lived in the World, tho' the Tragedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded upon Adventures they were never engaged in, on Purpoſe to make the Subject more credible. In a Word, beſides the hidden Meaning of an Epic Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory, the plain literal Senſe ought to appear proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Story ſhould be ſuch as an ordinary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may acquieſce in, whatever natural, moral, or political Truth may be diſcovered in it by Men of greater Penetration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SATAN</hi> after having long wandred upon the Surface, or outmoſt Wall of the Univerſe, diſcovers at laſt a wide Gap in it, which led into the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is deſcribed as the Opening through which the Angels paſs to and fro into the lower World, upon their Errands to Mankind. His Sitting upon the Brink of this Paſſage, and taking a Survey of the whole Face of Nature, that appeared to him new and freſh in all its Beauties, with the Simile illuſtrating this Circumſtance, fills the Mind of the Reader with as ſurpriſing and glorious an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea as any that ariſes in the whole Poem. He looks down into that vaſt Hollow of the Univerſe with the Eye, or (as <hi>Milton</hi> calls it in his firſt Book) with the Kenn of an Angel. He ſurveys all the Wonders in this immenſe Amphitheatre that lye between both the Poles of Heaven, and takes in at one View the whole Round of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>HIS Flight between the ſeveral Worlds that ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on every Side of him, with the particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Sun, are ſet forth in all the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of a luxuriant Imagination. His Shape, Speech and Behaviour upon his transforming himſelf
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0106100100:63"/>
into an Angel of Light, are touched with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Beauty. The Poet's Thought of directing <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> to the Sun, which in the Vulgar Opinion of Mankind is the moſt conſpicuous Part of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and the placing in it an Angel, is a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance very finely contrived, and the more adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to a poetical Probability, as it was a received Doctrine among the moſt famous Philoſophers, that every Orb had its <hi>Intelligence;</hi> and as an Apoſtle in ſacred Writ is ſaid to have ſeen ſuch an Angel in the Sun. In the Anſwer which this Angel returns to the diſguiſed Evil Spirit, there is ſuch a beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Majeſty as is altogether ſuitable to a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Being. The Part of it in which he repreſents himſelf as preſent at the Creation, is very noble in it ſelf, and not only proper where it is introduced, but requiſite to prepare the Reader for what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the Seventh Book. <q>
                  <l>I ſaw when at his Word the formleſs Maſs,</l>
                  <l>This World's Material Mould, came to a Heap:</l>
                  <l>Confuſion heard his Voice, and wild uproar</l>
                  <l>Stood rul'd, ſtood vaſt infinitude confin'd;</l>
                  <l>Till at his ſecond bidding Darkneſs fled,</l>
                  <l>Light ſhon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IN the following Part of the Speech he points out the Earth with ſuch Circumſtances, that the Reader can ſcarce forbear fancying himſelf employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſame diſtant View of it. <q>
                  <l>Look downward on the Globe whoſe hither Side</l>
                  <l>With light from hence, tho' but reflected, ſhines;</l>
                  <l>That Place is Earth, the Seat of Man, that light</l>
                  <l>His day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not conclude my Reflections upon this third Book of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> without taking Notice
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0106100100:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of that celebrated Complaint of <hi>Milton</hi> with which it opens, and which certainly deſerves all the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that have been given it; tho' as I have before hinted, it may rather be looked upon as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence, than as an eſſential Part of the Poem. The ſame Obſervation might be applied to that beautiful Digreſſion upon Hypocriſie, in the ſame Book.</p>

            <p>THOSE, who know how many Volumes have been written on the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> will eaſily pardon the Length of my Diſcourſe upon <hi>Milton. The Paradiſe Loſt</hi> is looked upon, by the beſt Judges, as the greateſt Production, or at leaſt the nobleſt Work of Genius, in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and therefore deſerves to be ſet before an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader in its full Beauty. For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, tho' I have endeavoured to give a general I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of its Graces and Imperfections in my ſix firſt Papers, I thought my ſelf obliged to beſtow one upon every Book in particular. The Three firſt Books I have already diſpatched, and am now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the Fourth. I need not acquaint my Reader, that there are Multitudes of Beauties in this great Author, eſpecially in the deſcriptive Parts of his Poem, which I have not touched upon; it being my Intention to point out thoſe only, which appear to me the moſt exquiſite, or thoſe which are not ſo obvious to ordinary Readers. Every one that has read the Criticks, who have written upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0106100100:65"/>
the <hi>Odiſſy,</hi> the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> knows very well, that though they agree in their Opinions of the great Beauties in thoſe Poems, they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs each of them diſcovered ſeveral Maſter-Strokes, which have eſcaped the Obſervation of the reſt. In the ſame Manner, I queſtion not, but any Writer, who ſhall treat on this Subject after me, may find ſeveral Beauties in <hi>Milton,</hi> which I have not taken notice of. I muſt likewiſe obſerve, that as the greateſt Maſters of critical Learning differ among one another, as to ſome particular Points in an Epic Poem, I have not bound my ſelf ſcrupulouſly to the Rules which any one of them has laid down upon that Art, but have taken the Liberty ſometimes to join with one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with another, and ſometimes to differ from all of them, when I have thought that the Reaſon of the Thing was on my Side.</p>
            <p>WE may conſider the Beauties of the Fourth Book under three Heads. In the firſt are thoſe Pictures of Still-Life, which we meet with in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Eden, Paradiſe, Adam</hi>'s Bower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the next are the Machines, which comprehend the Speeches and Behaviour of the good and bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. In the laſt is the Conduct of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who are the principal Actors in the Poem.</p>
            <p>IN the Deſcription of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the Poet has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Rule of laviſhing all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Diction on the weak unactive Parts of the Fable, which are not ſupported by the Beauty of Sentiments and Characters. Accordingly the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obſerve, that the Expreſſions are more flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and elaborate in theſe Deſcriptions, than in moſt other Parts of the Poem. I muſt further add, that tho' the <hi>Drawings</hi> of Gardens, Rivers, Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows, and the like dead Pieces of Nature, are juſtly cenſured in an heroic Poem, when they run out into an unneceſſary Length; the Deſcription of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0106100100:66"/>
               <hi>Paradiſe</hi> would have been faulty, had not the Poet been very particular in it, not only as it is the Scene of the principal Action, but as it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to give us an Idea of that Happineſs from which our firſt Parents fell. The Plan of it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully beautiful, and formed upon the ſhort Sketch which we have of it, in Holy Writ. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of Imagination has poured forth ſuch a Redundancy of Ornaments on this Seat of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Innocence, that it would be endleſs to point out each Particular.</p>
            <p>I muſt not quit this Head, without further obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that there is ſcarce a Speech of <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi> in the whole Poem, wherein the Sentiments and Alluſions are not taken from this their delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Habitation. The Reader, during their whole Courſe of Action, always finds himſelf in the Walks of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> In ſhort, as the Criticks have remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that in thoſe Poems, wherein Shepherds are Actors, the Thoughts ought always to take a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from the Woods, Fields and Rivers; ſo we may obſerve, that our firſt Parents ſeldom loſe Sight of their happy Station in any Thing they ſpeak or do; and, if the Reader will give me Leave to uſe the Expreſſion, that their Thoughts are always <hi>paradiſiacal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are in the next Place to conſider the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines of the Fourth Book. <hi>Satan</hi> being now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Proſpect of <hi>Eden,</hi> and looking round upon the Glories of the Creation, is filled with Sentiments different from thoſe which he diſcovered whilſt he was in Hell. The Place inſpires him with Thoughts more adapted to it: He reflects upon the happy Condition from whence he fell, and breaks forth into a Speech that is ſoftned with ſeveral tranſient Touches of Remorſe and Self-Accuſation: But at length, he confirms himſelf in Impenitence, and in his Deſign of drawing Men into his own State
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0106100100:67"/>
of Guilt and Miſery. This Conflict of Paſſions is raiſed with a great deal of Art, as the Opening of his Speech to the Sun is very bold and noble. <q>
                  <l>O thou that with ſurpaſſing Glory crown'd</l>
                  <l>Look'ſt from thy ſole Dominion like the God</l>
                  <l>Of this new World, at whoſe Sight all the Stars</l>
                  <l>Hide their diminiſh'd Heads, to thee I call</l>
                  <l>But with no friendly Voice, and add thy Name</l>
                  <l>O <hi>Sun,</hi> to tell thee how I hate thy Beams</l>
                  <l>That bring to my Remembrance from what State</l>
                  <l>I fell, how glorious once above thy Sphere.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Speech is, I think, the fineſt that is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Satan</hi> in the whole Poem. The Evil Spirit afterwards proceeds to make his Diſcoveries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our firſt Parents, and to learn after what Manner they may be beſt attacked. His bounding over the Walls of <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> his ſitting in the Shape of a Cormorant upon the Tree of Life, which ſtood in the Center of it, and over-topped all the other Trees of the Garden; his alighting among the Herd of Animals, which are ſo beautifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as playing about <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his transforming himſelf into different Shapes, in order to hear their Converſation; are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that give an agreeable Surprize to the Reader, and are deviſed with great Art, to connect that Series of Adventures in which the Poet has engaged this great Artificer of Fraud.</p>
            <p>THE Thought of <hi>Saian</hi>'s Transformation into a Cormorant, and placing himſelf on the Tree of Life, ſeems raiſed upon that Paſſage in the <hi>Ilaid,</hi> where two Deities are deſcribed, as perching on the Top of an Oak in the Shape of Vulturs.</p>
            <p>HIS planting himſelf at the Ear of <hi>Eve</hi> under the Form of a Toad, in order to produce vain Dreams and Imaginations, is a Circumſtance of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0106100100:68"/>
the ſame Nature; as his ſtarting up in his own Form is wonderfully fine, both in the literal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and in the Moral which is concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. His Anſwer upon his being diſcovered, and demanded to give an Account of himſelf, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Pride and Intrepidity of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. <q>
                  <l>Know ye not then, ſaid <hi>Satan,</hi> fill'd with Scorn,</l>
                  <l>Know ye not Me? ye knew me once ne Mate</l>
                  <l>For You, there ſitting where you durſt not ſoare;</l>
                  <l>Not to know Me argues your-ſelves unknown,</l>
                  <l>The loweſt of your throng;—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ZEPHON</hi>'s Rebuke, with the Influence it had on <hi>Satan,</hi> is exquiſitely graceful and moral. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> is afterwards led away to <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the chief of the guardian Angels, who kept Watch in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> His diſdainful Behaviour on this Occaſion is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Beauty, that the moſt ordinary Reader cannot but take Notice of it. <hi>Gabriel</hi>'s diſcovering his Approach at a Diſtance, is drawn with great Strength and Livelineſs of Imagination. <q>
                  <l>O Friends, I hear the tread of nimble Feet</l>
                  <l>Haſt'ning this Way, and now by glimps diſcern</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ithuriel</hi> and <hi>Zephon</hi> through the ſhade;</l>
                  <l>And with them comes a third of regal Port,</l>
                  <l>But faded ſplendor wan; who by his gait</l>
                  <l>And fierce demeanor ſeems the Prince of Hell,</l>
                  <l>Not likely to part hence without conteſt;</l>
                  <l>Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Conference between <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Sentiments proper for the Occaſion, and ſuitable to the Perſons of the two Speakers. <hi>Satan</hi>'s cloathing himſelf with Terror, when he Prepares for the Combat, is truly ſublime, and at
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0106100100:69"/>
leaſt equal to <hi>Homer</hi>'s Deſcription of Diſcord cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by <hi>Longinus,</hi> or to that of Fame in <hi>Virgil,</hi> who are both repreſented with their Feet ſtanding upon the Earth, and their Heads reaching above the Clouds. <q>
                  <l>While thus he ſpake, th' Angelic Squadron bright</l>
                  <l>Turn'd fiery red, ſharpning in mooned Horns</l>
                  <l>Their Phalanx, and began to hem him round</l>
                  <l>With ported Spears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>—On th' other Side, <hi>Satan</hi> alarm'd,</l>
                  <l>Collecting all his might dilated ſtood</l>
                  <l>Like <hi>Teneriff</hi> or <hi>Atlas</hi> unremov'd.</l>
                  <l>His Stature reach'd the Sky, and on his Creſt</l>
                  <l>Sat horrour plum'd;—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here take notice, that <hi>Milton</hi> is every where full of Hints, and ſometimes literal Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, taken from the greateſt of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. But this I may reſerve for a Diſcourſe by it ſelf, becauſe I would not break the Thread of theſe Speculations, that are deſigned for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Readers, with ſuch Reflections as would be of no Uſe but to the Learned.</p>
            <p>I muſt however obſerve in this Place, that the breaking off the Combat between <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> by the hanging out of the golden Scales in Heaven, is a Refinement upon <hi>Homer</hi>'s Thought, who tells us, that before the Battle between <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles, Jupiter</hi> weighed the Event of it in a Pair of Scales. The Reader may ſee the whole Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the 22d <hi>Iliad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIRGIL,</hi> before the laſt deciſive Combat, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the ſame Manner, as weighing the Fates of <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Aeneas. Milton,</hi> though he fetched this beautiful Circumſtance from the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Aeneid,</hi> does not only inſert it as a poetical Embelliſhment, like the Authors above-mentioned;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0106100100:70"/>
but makes an artful Uſe of it for the proper carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of his Fable, and for the breaking off the Combat between the two Warriors, who were upon the Point of engaging. To this we may further add, that <hi>Milton</hi> is the more juſtified in this Paſſage, as we find the ſame noble Allegory in Holy Writ, where a wicked Prince, ſome few Hours before he was aſſaulted and ſlain, is ſaid to have been <hi>weigh'd in the Scales, and to have been found wanting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here take Notice under the Head of the Machines, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel</hi>'s gliding down to the Earth upon a Sun-beam, with the Poet's Device to make him <hi>deſcend,</hi> as well in his Return to the Sun, as in his coming from it, is a Prettineſs that might have been admired in a little fanciful Poet, but ſeems below the Genius of <hi>Milton.</hi> The Deſcription of the Hoſt of armed Angels walking their nightly Round in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> is of another Spirit;
<q>
                  <l>So ſaying, on he led his radiant files,</l>
                  <l>Dazling the Moon;</l>
               </q>
as that Account of the Hymns, which our firſt Parents uſed to hear them ſing in theſe their Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night-Walks, is altogether Divine, and inexpreſſibly amuſing to the Imagination.</p>
            <p>WE are, in the laſt Place, to conſider the Parts which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> act in the fourth Book. The Deſcription of them as they firſt appeared to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> is exquiſitely drawn, and ſufficient to make the fallen Angel gaze upon them with all that Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and thoſe Emotions of Envy, in which he is repreſented. <q>
                  <l>Two of far nobler Shape erect and tall,</l>

            <p>THE remaining Part of <hi>Eve</hi>'s Speech, in which ſhe gives an Account of her ſelf upon her firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and the Manner in which ſhe was brought to <hi>Adam,</hi> is I think as beautiful a Paſſage as any in <hi>Milton,</hi> or perhaps in any other Poet whatſoever.

            <p>A Poet of leſs Judgment and Invention than this great Author, would have found it very difficult to have filled theſe tender Parts of the Poem with Sentiments proper for a State of Innocence; to have deſcribed the Warmth of Love, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of it, without Artifice or Hyperbole; to have made the Man ſpeak the moſt endearing Things, without deſcending from his natural Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the Woman receiving them without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Modeſty of her Character; in a Word, to adjuſt the Prerogatives of Wiſdom and Beauty, and make each appear to the other in its proper Force and Lovelineſs. This mutual Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of the two Sexes is wonderfully kept up in the whole Poem, as particularly in the Speech of <hi>Eve</hi> I have before-mentioned, and upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of it in the following Lines; <q>
                  <l>So ſpake our general Mother, and with Eyes</l>
                  <l>Of conjugal Attraction unreprov'd,</l>

            </p>
            <p>THE Poet adds, that the Devil turned away with Envy at the Sight of ſo much Happineſs.</p>
            <p>WE have another View of our firſt Parents in their evening Diſcourſes, which is full of pleaſing Images, and Sentiments ſuitable to their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Characters. The Speech of <hi>Eve,</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is dreſſed up in ſuch a ſoft and natural Turn of Words and Sentiments, as cannot be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe my Reflections upon this Book, with obſerving the maſterly Tranſition which the Poet makes to their Evening Worſhip, in the following Lines. <q>
                  <l>Thus at their ſhadie lodge arriv'd, both ſtood,</l>
                  <l>Both turn'd, and under open Sky ador'd</l>

                  <l>And Starry Pole: <hi>Thou alſo mad'ſt the Night,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>MOST of the modern heroic Poets have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ancients, in beginning a Speech without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing that the Perſon ſaid thus or thus: but as it is eaſie to imitate the Ancients in the Omiſſion of two or three Words, it requires Judgment to do it in ſuch a Manner as they ſhall not be miſſed, and that the Speech may begin naturally without them. There is a fine Inſtance of this Kind out of <hi>Homer,</hi> in the Twenty Third Chapter of <hi>Longinus.</hi>

            <p>WE were told in the foregoing Book how the Evil Spirit practiſed upon <hi>Eve</hi> as ſhe lay aſleep, in order to inſpire her with Thoughts of Vanity, Pride and Ambition. The Author, who ſhews a wonderful Art throughout his whole Poem, in preparing the Reader for the ſeveral Occurrences that ariſe in it, founds upon the above mention'd Circumſtance the Firſt Part of the Fifth Book. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> upon his Awaking finds <hi>Eve</hi> ſtill aſleep, with an unuſual Diſcompoſure in her Looks. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in which he regards her, is deſcribed with a Tenderneſs not to be expreſs'd, as the Whiſper with which he awakens her is the ſofteſt that ever was conveyed to a Lover's Ear. <q>
                  <l>His wonder was to find unwaken'd Eve</l>
                  <l>With Treſſes diſcompos'd, and glowing cheek</l>
                  <l>As through unquiet reſt: he on his ſide</l>

                  <l>Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld</l>
                  <l>Beauty which, whether waking or aſleep,</l>

            <p>AN injudicious Poet would have made <hi>Adam</hi> talk thro' the whole Work, in ſuch Sentiments as theſe.

Tho' the Cataſtrophe of the Poem is finely preſaged on this Occaſion, the Particulars of it are ſo artfully ſhadow'd, that they do not anticipate the Story which follows in the Ninth Book. I ſhall only add, that tho' the Viſion it ſelf is founded upon Truth, the Circumſtances of it are full of that Wildneſs and Inconſiſtency which are natural to a Dream. <hi>Adam,</hi> conformable to his ſuperior Character for Wiſdom, inſtructs and Comforts <hi>Eve</hi> upon this Occaſion. <q>

            <p>THE Morning Hymn is written in Imitation of one of thoſe Pſalms, where, in the Overflowings of Gratitude and Praiſe, the Pſalmiſt calls not only upon the Angels, but upon the moſt conſpicuous Parts of the inanimate Creation, to joyn with him in extolling their Common Maker. Invocations of this Nature fill the Mind with glorious Ideas of God's Works, and awaken that divine Euthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, which is ſo natural to Devotion. But if this Calling upon the dead Parts of Nature is at all Times a proper Kind of Worſhip, it was in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Manner ſuitable to our firſt Parents, who had the Creation freſh upon their Minds, and had not ſeen the various Diſpenſations of Providence, nor conſequently could be acquainted with thoſe many Topicks of Praiſe which might afford Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Devotions of their Poſterity. I need not remark the beautiful Spirit of Poetry, which runs through this whole Hymn, nor the Holineſs of that Reſolution with which it concludes.</p>
            <p>HAVING already mentioned thoſe Speeches which are aſſigned to the Perſons in this Poem, I proceed to the Deſcription which the Poet gives of <hi>Raphael.</hi> His Departure from before the Throne, and his Flight thro' the Choirs of Angels, is fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imaged. As <hi>Milton</hi> every where fills his Poem with Circumſtances that are marvellous and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he deſcribes the Gate of Heaven as framed after ſuch a Manner, that it open'd of it ſelf upon the Approach of the Angel who was to paſs through it. <q>

            <p>THE Poet here ſeems to have regarded two or three Paſſages in the 18th <hi>Iliad,</hi> as that in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, where, ſpeaking of <hi>Vulcan, Homer</hi> ſays, that he had made twenty <hi>Tripodes</hi> running on Golden Wheels, which, upon Occaſion, might go of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Aſſembly of the Gods, and, when there was no more Uſe for them, return again after the ſame Manner. <hi>Scaliger</hi> has rallied <hi>Homer</hi> very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely upon this Point, as M. <hi>Dacier</hi> has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to defend it. I will not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether in this Particular of <hi>Homer,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous does not loſe Sight of the Probable. As the miraculous Workmanſhip of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Gates is not ſo extraordinary as this of the <hi>Tripodes,</hi> ſo I am perſuaded he would not have mentioned it, had not he been ſupported in it by a Paſſage in the Scripture, which ſpeaks of Wheels in Heav'n that had Life in them, and moved of themſelves, or ſtood ſtill, in Conformity with the Cherubims, whom they accompanied.</p>
            <p>THERE is no Queſtion but <hi>Milton</hi> had this Circumſtance in his Thoughts, becauſe in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Book he deſcribes the Chariot of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> with <hi>living</hi> Wheels, according to the Plan in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Viſion. <q>
                  <l>—Forth ruſh'd with whirlwind ſound</l>
                  <l>The Chariot of Paternal Deity,</l>
                  <l>Flaſhing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,</l>
                  <l>It ſelf inſtinct with Spirit—</l>

in <hi>Homer,</hi> by ſomething parallel in Holy Writ, would have been very well pleaſed had they thought of confronting <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s <hi>Tripodes</hi> with <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Wheels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>RAPHAEL</hi>'s Deſcent to the Earth, with the Figure of his Perſon, is repreſented in very lively Colours. Several of the <hi>French, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Poets have given a Looſe to their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Deſcription of Angels: But I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have met with any ſo finely drawn, and ſo conformable to the Notions which are given of them in Scripture, as this in <hi>Milton.</hi> After having ſet him forth in all his heavenly Plumage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented him as alighting upon the Earth, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et concludes his Deſcription with a Circumſtance, which is altogether new, and imagined with the greateſt Strength of Fancy. <q>
                  <l>—Like <hi>Maia</hi>'s Son he ſtood</l>
                  <l>And ſhook his plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance fill'd</l>
                  <l>The Circuit wide—</l>

               <hi>RAPHAEL</hi>'s Reception by the Guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; his paſſing through the Wilderneſs of Sweets; his diſtant Appearance to <hi>Adam;</hi> have all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Poetry is capable of beſtowing.

THOUGH in this, and other Parts of the ſame Book, the Subject is only the Houſewifry of our Firſt Parent, it is ſet off with ſo many pleaſing Images and ſtrong Expreſſions, as make it none of the leaſt agreeable Parts in this Divine Work.</p>
            <p>THE natural Majeſty of <hi>Adam,</hi> and at the ſame Time his ſubmiſſive Behaviour to the ſuperior Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who had vouchſafed to be his Gueſt; the ſolemn <hi>Hail</hi> which the Angel beſtows upon the Mother of Mankind, with the Figure of <hi>Eve</hi> miniſtring at the Table, are Circumſtances which deſerve to be admired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>RAPHAEL</hi>'s Behaviour is every Way ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Dignity of his Nature, and to that Character of a Sociable Spirit, with which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has ſo judiciouſly introduced him. He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Inſtructions to converſe with <hi>Adam,</hi> as one Friend converſes with another, and to warn him of the Enemy, who was contriving his Deſtruction: Accordingly he is repreſented as ſitting down at a Table with <hi>Adam,</hi> and eating of the Fruits of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</hi> The Occaſion naturally leads him to his Diſcourſe on the Food of Angels. After having thus entered into Converſation with Man upon more indifferent Subjects, he warns him of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and makes a natural Tranſition to the Hiſtory of that fallen Angel, who was employed in the Circumvention of our firſt Parents.</p>
            <p>HADI follow'd Monſieur <hi>Boſſu</hi>'s Method, in my firſt Paper on <hi>Milton,</hi> I ſhould have dated the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> from the Beginning of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>'s Speech in this Book, as he ſuppoſes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> to begin in the ſecond Book of that Poem. I could alledge many Reaſons for my drawing the Action of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> rather from its immediate Beginning in the firſt Book, than from its remote Beginning in the ſecond, and ſhew why I have conſidered the ſacking of <hi>Troy</hi> as an
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0106100100:81"/>
               <hi>Epiſode,</hi> according to the common Acceptation of that Word. But as this would be a dry unenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Piece of Criticiſm, and perhaps unneceſſary to thoſe who have read my firſt Paper, I ſhall not enlarge upon it. Which-ever of the Notions be true, the Unity of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Action is preſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to either of them; whether we conſider the Fall of Man in its immediate Beginning, as proceeding from the Reſolutions taken in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Council; or in its more remote Beginning, as proceeding from the firſt Revolt of the Angels in Heaven. The Occaſion which <hi>Milton</hi> aſſigns for this Revolt, as it is founded on Hints in Holy Writ, and on the Opinion of ſome great Writers, ſo it was the moſt proper that the Poet could have made uſe of.</p>
            <p>THE Revolt in Heaven is deſcribed with great Force of Indignation, and a fine Variety of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The learned Reader cannot but be pleaſed with the Poet's Imitation of <hi>Homer</hi> in the laſt of the following Lines. <q>
                  <l>At length into the limits of the North</l>
                  <l>They came, and Satan took his Royal Seat</l>
                  <l>High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount</l>
                  <l>Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Tow'rs</l>
                  <l>From Diamond Quarries hewn, and Rocks of Gold,</l>
                  <l>The Palace of great <hi>Lucifer,</hi> (ſo call</l>
                  <l>That Structure in the Dialect of Men</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOMER</hi> mentions Perſons and Things, which he tells us in the Language of the Gods are call'd by different Names from thoſe they go by in the Language of Men. <hi>Milton</hi> has imitated him with his uſual Judgment in this particular Place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has likewiſe the Authority of Scripture to juſtify him. The Part of <hi>Abdiel,</hi> who was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0106100100:82"/>
Spirit that in this infinite Hoſt of Angels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Allegiance to his Maker, exhibits to us a noble Moral of religious Singularity. The Zeal of the Seraph breaks forth in a becoming Warmth of Sentiments and Expreſſions, as the Character which is given us of him denotes that generous Scorn and Intrepidity which attends heroic Virtue. The Author doubtleſs deſigned it as a Pattern to thoſe who live among Mankind in their preſent State of Degeneracy and Corruption. <q>
                  <l>So ſpake the Seraph <hi>Abdiel</hi> faithful found,</l>

            <p>WE are now entering upon the Sixth Book of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> in which the Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Battel of Angels; having raiſed his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Expectation, and prepar'd him for it by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paſſages in the preceding Books. I omitted quoting theſe Paſſages in my Obſervations on the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0106100100:83"/>
former Books, having purpoſely reſerved them for the Opening of this, the Subject of which gave Occaſion to them. The Author's Imagination was ſo inflamed with this great Scene of Action, that wherever he ſpeaks of it, he riſes, if poſſible, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove himſelf. Thus where he mentions <hi>Satan</hi> in the Beginning of his Poem. <q>
                  <l>—Him the Almighty Power</l>
                  <l>Hurt'd headlong flaming from th' Etherial Skie,</l>

                  <l>Who durſt defie the Omnipotent to Arms.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>WE have likewiſe ſeveral noble Hints of it in the infernal Conference. <q>
                  <l>O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers</l>
                  <l>That led th' embattel'd Seraphim to War,</l>

                  <l>Hath loſt us Heav'n and all this mighty hoſt</l>
                  <l>In horrible deſtruction laid thus low.</l>

                  <l>His Miniſters of vengeance and purſuit</l>

                  <l>Shot after us in Storm, o'erblown hath laid</l>
                  <l>The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</l>

                  <l>Wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage,</l>
                  <l>Perhaps hath ſpent his Shafts, and ceaſes now</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral other very ſublime Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on the ſame Subject in the Firſt Book, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Second. <q>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0106100100:84"/>
                  <l>What when we fled amain, purſu'd and ſtrook</l>
                  <l>With Heav'n's afflicting Thunder, and beſought</l>
                  <l>The Deep to ſhelter us; this Hell then ſeem'd</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, the Poet never mentions any thing of this Battel, but in ſuch Images of Greatneſs and Terrour as are ſuitable to the Subject. Among ſeveral others, I cannot forbear quoting that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage where the Power, who is deſcrib'd as preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over the Chaos, ſpeaks in the Third Book. <q>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Satan;</hi> and him thus the Anarch old</l>
                  <l>With faultring ſpeech and viſage incompos'd</l>
                  <l>Anſwer'd, I know thee, Stranger, who thou art,</l>
                  <l>That mighty leading Angel, who of late</l>
                  <l>Made head againſt Heav'ns King, tho' overthrown.</l>
                  <l>I ſaw and hoard; for ſuch a numerous Hoſt</l>
                  <l>Fled not in Silence through the frighted Deep</l>
                  <l>With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,</l>
                  <l>Confuſion worſe confounded; and Heav'ns Gates</l>
                  <l>Pour'd out by Millions her victorious Bands</l>
                  <l>Purſuing.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IT required great Pregnacy of Invention, and Strength of Imagination, to fill this Battel with ſuch Circumſtances as ſhould raiſe and aſtoniſh the Mind of the Reader; and, at the ſame time, an Exactneſs of Judgment to avoid every thing that might appear light or trivial. Thoſe who look into <hi>Homer,</hi> are ſurpriz'd to find his Battels ſtill riſing one above another, and improving in Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to the Concluſion of the <hi>Iliad. Milton</hi>'s Fight of Angels is wrought up with the ſame Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is uſher'd in with ſuch Signs of Wrath as are ſuitable to Omnipotence incenſed. The firſt Engagement is carried on under a Cope of Fire, occaſion'd by the Flights of innumerable burning
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0106100100:85"/>
Darts and Arrows which are diſcharged from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hoſt. The ſecond Onſet is ſtill more terrible, as it is filled with thoſe artificial Thunders, which ſeem to make the Victory doubtful, and produce a kind of Conſternation even in the Good Angels. This is follow'd by the tearing up of Mountains and Promontories; 'till, in the laſt Place, <hi>Meſſiah</hi> comes forth in the Fullneſs of Majeſty and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The Pomp of his Appearance, amidſt the Roarings of his Thunders, the Flaſhes of his Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and the Noiſe of his Chariot-Wheels, is deſcribed with the utmoſt Flights of Humane I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination.</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing in the firſt and laſt Day's Engagement which does not appear natural, and agreeable enough to the Ideas moſt Readers would conceive of a Fight between two Armies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond Day's Engagement is apt to ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle an Imagination, which has not been raiſed and qualified for ſuch a Deſcription, by the reading of the antient Poets, and of <hi>Homer</hi> in particular. It was certainly a very bold Thought in our Author, to aſcribe the firſt Uſe of Artillery to the Rebel Angels. But as ſuch a pernicious Invention may be well ſuppoſed to have proceeded from ſuch Authors, ſo it entered very properly into the Thoughts of that Being, who is all along deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as aſpiring to the Majeſty of his Maker. Such Engines were the only Inſtruments he could have made uſe of to imitate thoſe Thunders, that in all Poetry, both Sacred and Prophane, are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as the Arms of the Almighty. The tearing up the Hills was not altogether ſo daring a Thought as the former. We are, in ſome meaſure, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ſuch an Incident by the Deſcription of the Giants War, which we meet with among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets. What ſtill made this Circumſtance
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0106100100:86"/>
the more proper for the Poet's Uſe, is the Opinion of many Learned Men, that the Fable of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants War, which makes ſo great a Noiſe in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and gave Birth to the ſublimeſt Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Heſiod</hi>'s Works, was an Allegory founded upon this very Tradition of a Fight between the good and bad Angels.</p>
            <p>IT may, perhaps, be worth while to conſider with what Judgment <hi>Milton,</hi> in this Narration, has avoided every thing that is mean and trivial in the Deſcriptions of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Poets; and, at the ſame time, improv'd every great Hint which he met with in their Works upon this Subject. <hi>Homer</hi> in that Paſſage, which <hi>Longinus</hi> has celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for its Sublimeneſs, and which <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> have copied after him, tells us that the Giants threw <hi>Oſſa</hi> upon <hi>Olympus,</hi> and <hi>Pelion</hi> upon <hi>Oſſa.</hi> He adds an Epithet to <hi>Pelion</hi> (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which very much ſwells the Idea, by bringing up to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Imagination all the Woods that grew upon it. There is further a great Beauty in his ſingling out by Name theſe three remarkable Mountains, ſo well known to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> This laſt is ſuch a Beauty as the Scene of <hi>Milton</hi>'s War could not poſſibly furniſh him with. <hi>Cloudian,</hi> in his Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Gyants War, has given full Scope to that Wildneſs of Imagination which was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him. He tells us, that the Giants tore up whole Iſlands by the Roots, and threw them at the Gods. He deſcribes one of them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar taking up <hi>Lemnos</hi> in his Arms, and whirling it to the Skies, with all <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Shop in the midſt of it. Another tears up Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> with the River <hi>Enipeus,</hi> which ran down the Sides of it; but the Poet, not content to deſcribe him with this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon his Shoulders, tells us, that the River flow'd down his Back, as he held it up in that Poſture. It is viſible to every judicious Reader,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0106100100:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſuch Ideas favour more of Burleſque than of the Sublime. They proceed from a Wantonneſs of Imagination, and rather divert the Mind than aſtoniſh it. <hi>Milton</hi> has taken every thing that is Sublime in theſe ſeveral Paſſages, and compoſes out of them the following great Image. <q>
                  <l>From their Foundations looſning to and fro</l>
                  <l>They pluck'd the ſeated Hills with all their load,</l>
                  <l>Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the ſhaggy tops</l>
                  <l>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p-lifting bore them in their Hands:—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>WE have the full Majeſty of <hi>Homer</hi> in this ſhort Deſcription, improved by the Imagination of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> without its Puerilities.</p>
            <p>I need not point out the Deſcription of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels ſeeing the Promontories hanging over their Heads in ſuch a dreadful Manner, with the other numberleſs Beauties in this Book, which are ſo conſpicuous, that they cannot eſcape the Notice of the moſt ordinary Reader.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed ſo many wonderful Strokes of Poetry in this Book, and ſuch a Variety of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Ideas, that it would have been impoſſible to have given them a Place within the Bounds of this Paper. Beſides that, I find it in a great meaſure done to my Hand at the End of my Lord <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common</hi>'s Eſſay on tranſlated Poetry. I ſhall refer my Reader thither for ſome of the Maſter-Strokes in the Sixth Book of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> though at the ſame time there are many others which that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author has not taken notice of.</p>

               <hi>MILTON,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſublime-Genius he was Maſter of, has in this Book drawn to his Aſſiſtance all the Helps he could meet with among the ancient Poets. The Sword of <hi>Michael,</hi> which makes ſo great a Havock among the bad Angels, was given him, we are told; out of the Armory of God. <q>

                  <l>—But the Sword</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Michael</hi> from the Armory of God</l>
                  <l>Was giv'n him temper'd ſo, that neither keen</l>
                  <l>Nor ſolid might reſiſt that edge: it met</l>
                  <l>The Sword of <hi>Satan</hi> with ſteep force to ſmite</l>
                  <l>Deſcending, and in half cut ſheere,—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Paſſage is a Copy of that in <hi>Virgil,</hi> wherein the Poet tells us, that the Sword of <hi>AEneas,</hi> which was given him by a Deity, broke into Pieces the Sword of <hi>Turnus,</hi> which came from a mortal Forge. As the Moral in this Place is Divine, ſo by the way we may obſerve, that the beſtowing on a Man who is favour'd by Heav'n ſuch an Allegorical Weapon, is very conformable to the old Eaſtern Way of Thinking. Not only <hi>Homer</hi> has made uſe of it, but we find the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hero in the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who had fought the Battels of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen People with ſo much Glory and Succeſs, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his Dream a Sword from the Hand of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> The following Paſſage, wherein <hi>Satan</hi> is deſcribed as wounded by the Sword of <hi>Michael,</hi> is in Imitation of <hi>Homer.</hi>

               <hi>HOMER</hi> tells us in the ſame manner, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Diomedes</hi> wounding the Gods, there flow'd from the Wound an <hi>Ichor,</hi> or pure kind of Blood, which was not bred from Mortal Viands; and that tho' the Pain was exquiſitely great, the Wound ſoon cloſed up and healed in thoſe Beings who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with Immortality.</p>

I queſtion not but <hi>Milton</hi> in his Deſcription of his furious <hi>Moloc</hi> flying from the Battel, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing with the Wound he had received, had his Eye on <hi>Mars</hi> in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> who, upon his being wounded, is repreſented as retiring out of the Fight, and making an Outcry louder than that of a whole Army when it begins the Charge. <hi>Homer</hi> adds, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans,</hi> who were engaged in a general Battel, were terrified on each Side with the bellowing of this wounded Deity. The Reader will eaſily obſerve how <hi>Milton</hi> has kept all the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of this Image without running into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule of it. <q>
                  <l>—Where the might of <hi>Gabriel</hi> fought,</l>
                  <l>And with fierce Enſigns pierc'd the deep array</l>

            <p>
               <hi>MILTON</hi> has likewiſe raiſed his Deſcription in this Book with many Images taken out of the Poetical Parts of Scripture. The Meſſiah's Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, as <hi>I</hi> have before taken Notice, is form'd upon a Viſion of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who, as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, has very much in him of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Spirit in the Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Parts of his Prophecy.</p>
            <p>THE following Lines in that glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which is given the Meſſiah to extirpate the Hoſt of Rebel Angels, is drawn from a ſublime Paſſage in the Pſalms. <q>
                  <l>Go then thou mightieſt in thy Father's might</l>
                  <l>Aſcend my Chariot, guide the rapid wheels</l>

My Bow, my Thunder, my almighty Arms,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Reader will eaſily diſcover many other Stroaks of the ſame Nature.</p>
            <p>THERE is no queſtion but <hi>Milton</hi> had heated his Imagination with the Fight of the Gods in <hi>Homer,</hi> before he entered upon this Engagement of the Angels. <hi>Homer</hi> there gives us a Scene of Men, Heroes, and Gods mixed together in Battel. <hi>Mars</hi> animates the contending Armies, and lifts up his Voice in ſuch a manner, that it is heard diſtinctly amidſt all the Shouts and Confuſion of the Fight. <hi>Jupiter</hi> at the ſame time thunders over their Heads; while <hi>Neptune</hi> raiſes ſuch a Tempeſt, that the whole Field of Battel, and all the Tops of the Mountains, ſhake about them. The Poet tells us, that <hi>Pluto</hi> himſelf, whoſe Habitation was in the very Center of the Earth, was ſo affrighted at the Shock, that he leapt from his Throne. <hi>Homer</hi> afterwards deſcribes <hi>Vulcan</hi> as pouring down a Storm of Fire upon the River <hi>Xanthus,</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> as throwing a Rock at <hi>Mars;</hi> who, he tells us, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſeven Acres in his Fall.</p>
            <p>AS <hi>Homer</hi> has introduced into his Battel of the Gods every thing that is great and terrible in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Milton</hi> has filled his Fight of Good and Bad Angels with all the like Circumſtances of Horrour. The Shout of Armies, the Ratling of Brazen Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, the Hurling of Rocks and Mountains, the Earthquake, the Fire, the Thunder, are all of them employ'd to lift up the Reader's Imagination, and give him a ſuitable Idea of ſo great an Action. With what Art has the Poet repreſented the whole Body of the Earth trembling, even before it was created. <q>
                  <l>All Heaven reſounded, and had Earth been then,</l>
                  <l>All Earth had to its Center ſhook—</l>

IN how ſublime and juſt a Manner does he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards deſcribe the whole Heaven ſhaking under the Wheels of the <hi>Meſſiah's</hi> Chariot, with that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the Throne of God? <q>
                  <l>—<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder his burning Wheels</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears cloathed with ſo much Terrour and Majeſty, the Poet has ſtill found Means to make his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders conceive an Idea of him beyond what he himſelf was able to deſcribe. <q>
                  <l>Yet half his Strength he put not forth, but checkt</l>
                  <l>His thunder in mid Volly, for he meant</l>

            <p>IN a Word, <hi>Milton</hi>'s Genius, which was ſo great in it ſelf, and ſo ſtrenghened by all the Helps of Learning, appears in this Book every way equal to his Subject, which was the moſt ſublime that could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet. As he knew all the Arts of Affecting the Mind, he knew it was neceſſary to give it certain Reſting-places and Opportunities of recovering it ſelf from Time to Time: He has therefore with great Addreſs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed ſeveral Speeches, Reflections, Similitudes, and the like Reliefs, to diverſifie his Narration, and eaſe the Attention of the Reader, that he might come freſh to his great Action; and by ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt of Ideas, have a more lively Taſte of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Parts of his Deſcription.</p>

               <hi>LONGIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> has obſerved, that there may be a Loftineſs in Sentiments, where there is no Paſſion, and brings Inſtances out of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to ſupport this his Opinion. The Pathetick, as that great Critick obſerves, may animate and inflame the Sublime, but is not eſſential to it. Accordingly, as he further remarks, we very often find that thoſe who excel moſt in ſtirring up the Paſſions, very often want the Talent of writing in the great and ſublime Manner; and ſo on the contrary. <hi>Milton</hi> has ſhewn himſelf a Maſter in both theſe Ways of Writing. The ſeventh Book, which we are now entering upon, is an Inſtance of that Sublime which is not mixt and work'd up with Paſſion. The Author appears in a kind of compoſed and ſedate Majeſty; and tho' the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not give ſo great an Emotion as thoſe in the former Book, they abound with as magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Ideas. The ſixth Book, like a troubled O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, repreſents Greatneſs in Confuſion; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth affects the Imagination like the Ocean in a Calm, and Fills the Mind of the Reader, without producing in it any Thing like Tumult or Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>THE Critick above-mentioned, among the Rules which he lays down for ſucceeding in the ſublime
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0106100100:93"/>
way of writing, propoſes to his Reader, that he ſhould imitate the moſt celebrated Authors who have gone before him, and been engaged in Works of the ſame Nature; as in particular that if he writes on a poetical Subject, he ſhould conſider how <hi>Homer</hi> would have ſpoken on ſuch an Occaſion. By this Means one great Genius often catches the Flame from another, and writes in his Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out copying ſervilely after him. There are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhining Paſſages in <hi>Virgil,</hi> which have been lighted up by <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON,</hi> tho' his own natural Strength of Genius was capable of furniſhing out a perfect Work, has doubtleſs very much raiſed and ennobled his Conceptions, by ſuch an Imitation as that which <hi>Longinus</hi> has recommended.</p>
            <p>IN this Book, which gives us an Account of the Six Days Works, the Poet received but very few Aſſiſtances from Heathen Writers, who were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Wonders of Creation. But as there are many glorious Strokes of Poetry upon this Subject in Holy Writ, the Author has numberleſs Alluſions to them through the whole Courſe of this Book. The great Critick I have before mentioned, though an Heathen, has taken Notice of the ſublime Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Law-giver of the <hi>Jews</hi> has deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Creation in the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and there are many other Paſſages in Scripture, which riſe up to the ſame Majeſty, where this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is touched upon. <hi>Milton</hi> has ſhewn his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very remarkably, in making uſe of ſuch of theſe as were proper for his Poem, and in duly qualifying thoſe high Strains of Eaſtern Poetry, which were ſuited to Readers whoſe Imaginations were ſet to an higher Pitch, than thoſe of colder Climates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi>'s Speech to the Angel, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires an Account of what had paſſed within the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0106100100:94"/>
of Nature before the Creation, is very great and ſolemn. The following Lines, in which he tells him, that the Day is not too far ſpent for him to enter upon ſuch a Subject, are exquiſite in their Kind. <q>
                  <l>And the Great Light of Day yet wants to run</l>
                  <l>Much of his race though ſteep, ſuſpenſe in Heav'n</l>
                  <l>Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears,</l>
                  <l>And longer will delay to hear thee tell</l>
                  <l>His Generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Angel's encouraging our Firſt Parents in a modeſt Purſuit after Knowledge, with the Cauſes which he aſſigns for the Creation of the World, are very juſt and beautiful. The <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> by whom, as we are told in Scripture, the Worlds were made, comes forth in the Power of his Father, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with an Hoſt of Angels, and cloathed with ſuch a Majeſty as becomes his entering upon a Work, which, according to our Conceptions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the utmoſt Exertion of Omnipotence. What a beautiful Deſcription has our Author raiſed upon that Hint in one of the Prophets; <hi>And behold there came four Chariots out from between two Mountains, and the Mountains were Mountains of Braſs?</hi> 
               <q>

I have before taken Notice of theſe Chariots of God, and of theſe Gates of Heaven, and ſhall here only add, that <hi>Homer</hi> gives us the ſame Idea of the latter as opening of themſelves, tho' he afterwards takes off from it, by telling us, that the <hi>Hours</hi> firſt of all removed thoſe prodigious Heaps of Clouds which lay as a Barrier before them.</p>
            <p>I do not know any thing in the whole Poem more ſublime than the Deſcription which follows, where the Meſſiah is repreſented at the Head of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as looking down into the <hi>Chaos,</hi> calming its Confuſion, riding into the midſt of it, and drawing the firſt Out-Line of the Creation.<q>

THE Thought of the Golden Compaſſes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd altogether in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Spirit, and is a very noble Incident in this wonderful Deſcription. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> when he ſpeaks of the Gods, aſcribes to them ſeveral Arms and Inſtruments with the ſame Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Imagination. Let the Reader only peruſe the Deſcription of <hi>Minerva</hi>'s <hi>Aegis,</hi> or Buckler, in the Fifth Book of the Iliad, with her Spear which would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn whole Squadrons, and her Helmet, that was ſufficient to cover an Army drawn out of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cities: The Golden Compaſſes in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Paſſage appear a very natural Inſtrument in the Hand of him, whom <hi>Plato</hi> ſomewhere calls the Divine Geometrician. As Poetry delights in cloathing abſtracted Ideas in Allegories and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Images, we find a magnificent Deſcription of the Creation form'd after the ſame manner in one of the Prophets, wherein he deſcribes the Almighty Architect as meaſuring the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand, meteing out the Heavens with his Span, comprehending the Duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure, weighing the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Balance. Another of them deſcribing the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being in this great Work of Creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents him as laying the Foundations of the Earth, and ſtretching a Line upon it. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place as garniſhing the Heavens, ſtretching out the North over the empty Place, and hanging the Earth upon Nothing. This laſt noble Thought <hi>Milton</hi> has expreſs'd in the following Verſe. <q>
                  <l>And Earth ſelf-balanc'd on her Center hung.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Beauties of Deſcription in this Book lie ſo very thick, that it is impoſſible to enumerate them in this Paper. The Poet has employ'd on them the whole Energy of our Tongue. The ſeveral great Scenes of the Creation riſe up to view one

after another, in ſuch a Manner, that the Reader ſeems preſent at this wonderful Work, and to aſſiſt among the Choirs of Angels, who are the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of it. How glorious is the Concluſion of the firſt Day. <q>
                  <l>—Thus was the firſt day Ev'n and Morn.</l>

            <p>WE have the ſame Elevation of Thought in the third Day; when the Mountains were brought forth, and the Deep was made. <q>

                  <l>Into the Clouds, their tops aſcend the Sky:</l>
                  <l>So high as heav'd the tumid hills, ſo low</l>
                  <l>Down ſunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,</l>

            </p>
            <p>WE have alſo the Riſing of the whole vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World deſcrib'd in this Day's Work, which is filled with all the Graces that other Poets have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed on their Deſcription of the Spring, and leads the Reader's Imagination into a Theatre equally ſurprizing and beautiful.</p>
            <p>THE ſeveral Glories of the Heavens make their Appearance on the fourth Day. <q>

            </p>
            <p>ONE would wonder how the Poet could be ſo conciſe in his Deſcription of the Six Days Works, as to comprehend them within the Bounds of an Epiſode, and at the ſame Time ſo particular, as to give us a lively Idea of them. This is ſtill more remarkable in his Account of the fifth and ſixth Days, in which he has drawn out to our View the whole Animal Creation, from the Reptil to the Behemoth. As the Lion and the Leviathan are two of the nobleſt Productions in the World of living Creatures, the Reader will find a moſt exquiſite Spirit of Poetry in the Account which our Author gives us of them. The Sixth Day concludes with the Formation of Man, upon which the Angel takes Occaſion, as he did after the Battel in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to remind <hi>Adam</hi> of his Obedience, which was the principal Deſign of this his Viſit.</p>
            <p>THE Poet afterwards repreſents the Meſſiah re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into Heaven, and taking a Survey of his great Work. There is ſomething inexpreſſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime in this part of the Poem, where the Author deſcribes that great Period of Time, filled with ſo many glorious Circumſtances; when the Heavens and Earth were finiſhed; when the Meſſiah aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up in Triumph through the Everlaſting Gates; when he looked down with Pleaſure upon his new Creation; when every Part of Nature ſeem'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice

in its Exiſtence; when the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy. <q>
                  <l>So Ev'n and Morn accompliſh'd the Sixth day:</l>

            <p>I cannot conclude this Book upon the Creation, without mentioning a Poem which has lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd under that Title. The Work was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſo good an Intention, and is executed with ſo great a Maſtery, that it deſerves to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as one of the moſt uſeful and noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe. The Reader cannot but be pleaſed to find the Depths of Philoſophy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened with all the Charms of Poetry, and to ſee ſo great a Strength of Reaſon, amidſt ſo beautiful a Redundancy of the Imagination. The Author has ſhewn us that Deſign in all the Works of Nature, which neceſſarily leads us to the Knowledge of its firſt Cauſe. In ſhort, he has illuſtrated, by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0106100100:100"/>
and inconteſtable Inſtances, that divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> has ſo nobly aſcribed to the Supreme Being in his Formation of the World, when he tells us, that <hi>He created her, and ſaw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his Works.</hi>

            <p>THE Accounts which <hi>Raphael</hi> gives of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of Angels, and the Creation of the World, have in them thoſe Qualifications which the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks judge requiſite to an Epiſode. They are nearly related to the principal Action, and have a juſt Connection with the Fable.</p>
            <p>THE Eighth Book opens with a Beautiful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Impreſſion which this Diſcourſe of the Arch-Angel made on our firſt Parents. <hi>Adam</hi> afterwards, by a very natural Curioſity, enquries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Motions of thoſe Celeſtial Bodies which make the moſt glorious Appearance among the ſix Days Works. The Poet here, with a great deal of Art, repreſents <hi>Eve</hi> as withdrawing from this Part of their Converſation to Amuſements more ſuitable to her Sex. He well knew, that the Epiſode in this Book, which is filled with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Account of his Paſſion and Eſteem for <hi>Eve,</hi> would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for her Hearing, and has therefore deviſed very juſt and beautiful Reaſons for her retiring. <q>

                  <l>Roſe, and went forth among her Fruits and Flowers,</l>

                  <l>Her Husband the Relater ſhe preferr'd</l>

            <p>THE Angel's returning a doubtful Anſwer to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Enquiries, was not only proper for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon which the Poet aſſigns, but becauſe it would have been highly abſurd to have given the Sanction of an Arch-angel to any particular Syſtem of Philoſophy. The chief Points in the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> and <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypotheſis are deſcribed with great Conciſeneſs and Perſpicuity, and at the ſame Time dreſſed in very pleaſing and poetical Images.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM,</hi> to detain the Angel, enters afterwards upon his own Hiſtory, and relates to him the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which he found himſelf upon his Creation; as alſo his Converſation with his Maker and his firſt meeting with <hi>Eve.</hi> There is no Part of the Poem more apt to raiſe the Attention of the Reader, than this Diſcourſe of our great Anceſtor; as nothing can be more ſurprizing and delightful
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0106100100:102"/>
to us, than to hear the Sentiments that aroſe in the Firſt Man while he was yet new and freſh from the Hands of his Creator. The Poet has interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every thing which is delivered upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in Holy Writ with ſo many beautiful Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own, that nothing can be conceived more juſt and natural than this whole Epiſode. As our Author knew this Subject could not but be agreeable to his Reader, he would not throw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Relation of the ſix Days Works, but reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it for a diſtinct Epiſode, that he might have an Opportunity of expatiating upon it more at large. Before I enter on this Part of the Poem, I cannot but take Notice of two ſhining Paſſages in the Dialogue between <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angel. The firſt is that wherein our Anceſtor gives an Account of the Pleaſure he took in converſing with him, which contains a very noble Moral. <q>
                  <l>For while I ſit with thee, I ſeem in Heav'n,</l>
                  <l>And ſweeter thy Diſcourſe is to my Ear</l>
                  <l>Than Fruits of Palm-tree pleaſanteſt to Thirſt</l>
                  <l>And Hunger, both from Labour, at the Hour</l>
                  <l>Of ſweet Repaſt; they ſatiate, and ſoon fill,</l>
                  <l>Tho' pleaſant; but thy Words with Grace divine</l>
                  <l>Imbu'd, bring to their Sweetneſs no Satiety.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE other I ſhall mention is that in which the Angel gives a Reaſon why he ſhould be glad to hear the Story <hi>Adam</hi> was about to relate. <q>
                  <l>For I that Day was abſent, as befell,</l>
                  <l>Bound on a Voyage uncouth and obſcure,</l>
                  <l>Far on Excurſion towards the Gates of Hell,</l>
                  <l>Squar'd in full Legion (ſuch command we had)</l>
                  <l>To ſee that none thence iſſued forth a Spy,</l>
                  <l>Or Enemy, while God was in his Work,</l>
                  <l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is no Queſtion but our Poet drew the Image in what follows from that in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Sixth Book, where <hi>Aeneas</hi> and the Sybil ſtand before the Adamantine Gates, which are there deſcrib'd as ſhut upon the Place of Torments, and liſten to the Groans, the Clank of Chains, and the Noiſe of Iron Whips, that were heard in thoſe Regions of Pain and Sorrow. <q>
                  <l>—Faſt we found, faſt ſhut</l>
                  <l>The diſmal Gates, and barricadoed ſtrong;</l>
                  <l>But long e'er our approaching heard within</l>
                  <l>Noiſe, other than the Sound of Dance or Song,</l>
                  <l>Torment, and loud Lament, and furious Rage.</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi> then proceeds to give an Account of his Condition and Sentiments immediately after his Creation. How agreeably does he repreſent the Poſture in which he found himſelf, the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Landskip that ſurrounded him, and the Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart which grew up in him on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. <q>
                  <l>—As new waked from ſoundeſt Sleep,</l>
                  <l>Soft on the flowry Herb I found me laid</l>
                  <l>In balmy Sweat, which with his Beams the Sun</l>
                  <l>Soon dried, and on the reaking Moiſture fed.</l>
                  <l>Streight toward Heav'n my wondering Eyes I turn'd,</l>
                  <l>And gaz'd a while the amply Sky, till rais'd</l>
                  <l>By quick inſtinctive Motion up I ſprung,</l>
                  <l>As thitherward endeavouring, and upright</l>
                  <l>Stood on my Feet: About me round I ſaw</l>
                  <l>Hill, Dale, and ſhady Woods, and ſunny Plains,</l>
                  <l>And liquid Lapſe of murmuring Streams; by theſe,</l>
                  <l>Creatures that liv'd, and mov'd, and walk'd, or flew,</l>

Birds on the Branches warbling; all things ſmil'd:</l>
                  <l>With Fragrance and with Joy my Heart o'erflow'd.</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi> is afterwards deſcrib'd as ſurpriz'd at his own Exiſtence, and taking a Survey of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of all the Works of Nature. He likewiſe is repreſented as diſcovering by the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he and every thing about him muſt have been the Effect of ſome Being infinitely good and powerful, and that this Being had a Right to his Worſhip and Adoration. His firſt Addreſs to the Sun, and to thoſe Parts of the Creation which made the moſt diſtinguiſhed Figure, is very natural and amuſing to the Imagination. <q>
                  <l>—Thou Sun, ſaid I, fair Light,</l>
                  <l>And thou enlight'ned Earth, ſo freſh and gay,</l>
                  <l>Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HIS next Sentiment, when upon his firſt going to ſleep he fancies himſelf loſing his Exiſtence, and falling away into nothing, can never be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admired. His Dream, in which he ſtill preſerves the Conſciouſneſs of his Exiſtence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Removal into the Garden which was prepared for his Reception, are alſo Circumſtances finely imagined, and grounded upon what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in ſacred Story.</p>
            <p>THESE and the like wonderful Incidents in this Part of the Work, have in them all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Novelty, at the ſame Time that they have all the Graces of Nature. They are ſuch as none but a great Genius could have thought of, though, upon the Peruſal of them, they ſeem to riſe of themſelves from the Subject of which he treats. In a Word, though they are natural they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,

which is the true Character of all fine Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>THE Impreſſion which the Interdiction of the Tree of Life left in the Mind of our firſt Parent, is deſcribed with great Strength and Judgment; as the Image of the ſeveral Beaſts and Birds paſſing in Review before him is very beautiful and lively. <q>

                  <l>Approaching two and two, theſe cowring low</l>
                  <l>With Blandiſhment; each Bird ſtoop'd on his Wing:</l>
                  <l>I nam'd them as they paſs'd—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM,</hi> in the next Place, deſcribes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which he held with his Maker upon the Subject of Solitude. The Poet here repreſents the ſupreme Being, as making an Eſſay of his own Work, and putting to the Trial that reaſoning Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty with which he had endued his Creature. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> urges, in this divine Colloquy, the Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his being happy, tho' he was the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and Lord of the whole Creation, without the Converſation and Society of ſome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature, who ſhould partake thoſe Bleſſings with him. This Dialogue, which is ſupported chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Beauty of the Thoughts, without other poetical Ornaments, is as fine a Part as any in the whole Poem: The more the Reader examines the Juſtneſs and Delicacy of its Sentiments, the more he will find himſelf pleaſed with it. The Poet has wonderfully preſerved the Character of Majeſty and Condeſcenſion in the Creator, and at the ſame Time that of Humility and Adoration in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as particularly in the following Lines, <q>
                  <l>Thus I preſumptuous; and the Viſion bright,</l>
                  <l>As with a Smile more brightned, thus reply'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>—I with leave of Speech implor'd</l>

                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0106100100:106"/>
And humble Deprecation thus reply'd.</l>
                  <l>Let not my Words offend thee, heavenly Power,</l>
                  <l>My Maker, be propitious while I ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>

            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi> then proceeds to give an Account of his ſecond Sleep, and of the Dream in which he beheld the Formation of <hi>Eve.</hi> The new Paſſion that was awakened in him at the Sight of her is touched very finely. <q>
                  <l>

                  <l>That what ſeem'd fair in all the World ſeem'd now</l>
                  <l>Mean, or in her ſumm'd up, in her contain'd,</l>
                  <l>And in her Looks, which from that time infus'd</l>
                  <l>Sweetneſs into my Heart, unfelt before,</l>
                  <l>And into all things from her Air inſpir d</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi>'s Diſtreſs upon loſing Sight of this beautiful Phantom, with his Exclamations of Joy and Gratitude at the Diſcovery of a real Creature, who reſembled the Apparition which had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him in his Dream; the Approaches he makes to her, and his Manner of Courtſhip, are all laid together in a moſt exquiſite Propriety of Sentiments.</p>
            <p>THO' this Part of the Poem is work'd up with great Warmth and Spirit, the Love which is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in it is every way ſuitable to a State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence If the Reader compares the Deſcription which <hi>Adam</hi> here gives of his leading <hi>Eve</hi> to the Nuptial Bower, with that which Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has made on the ſame Occaſion in a Scene of his <hi>Fall of Man,</hi> he will be ſenſible of the great Care which <hi>Milton</hi> took to avoid all Thoughts on ſo delicate a Subject, that might be offenſive to Religion or good Manners. The Sentiments are chaſte, but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0106100100:107"/>
not cold, and convey to the Mind Ideas of the moſt tranſporting Paſſion, and of the greateſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

            </p>
            <p>THESE Sentiments of Love, in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, gave the Angel ſuch an Inſight into humane Nature, that he ſeems apprehenſive of the Evils which might befal the Species in general, as well as <hi>Adam</hi> in particular, from the Exceſs of this Paſſion. He therefore fortifies him againſt it by timely Admonitions; which very artfully prepare the Mind of the Reader for the Occurrences of the next Book, where the Weakneſs, of which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> here gives ſuch diſtant Diſcoveries, brings about that fatal Event which is the Subject of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em. His Diſcourſe, which follows the gentle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke he receiv'd from the Angel, ſhews that his Love, however violent it might appear, was ſtill founded in Reaſon, and conſequently not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>

            <p>IF we look into the three great Heroic Poems which have appear'd in the World, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that they are built upon very ſlight Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Homer</hi> lived near 300 Years after the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and, as the Writing of Hiſtory was not then in uſe among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we may very well ſuppoſe, that the Tradition of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had brought down but very few Particulars to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, tho' there is no Queſtion but he has wrought into his two Poems ſuch of their remarkable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures as were ſtill talked of among his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaties,</p>
            <p>THE Story of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> on which <hi>Virgil</hi> founded his Poem, was likewiſe very bare of Circumſtances, and by that Means afforded him an Opportunity of embelliſhing it with Fiction, and giving a full Range to his own Invention. We find, however, that he has interwoven, in the Courſe, of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the principal Particulars, which were generally believed among the <hi>Romans,</hi> of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his Voyage and Settlement in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Reader may find an Abridgment of the whole Story as collected out of the ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and as it was received among the <hi>Romans,</hi> in <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE none of the Criticks have conſidered <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Fable, with relation to this Hiſtory of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas;</hi> it may not, perhaps, be amiſs to examine it in this Light, ſo far as regards my preſent Purpoſe.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0106100100:110"/>
Whoever looks into the Abridgment above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, will find that the Character of <hi>Aeneas</hi> is filled with Piety to the Gods, and a ſuperſtitious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Prodigies, Oracles, and Predictions. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> has not only preſerved this Character in the Perſon of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> but has given a Place in his Poem to thoſe particular Prophecies which he found recorded of him in Hiſtory and Tradition. The Poet took the Matters of Fact as they came down to him, and circumſtanced them after his own Manner, to make them appear the more natural, agreeable, or ſurprizing. I believe very many Readers have been ſhocked at that ludicrous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which one of the <hi>Harpeys</hi> pronounces to the <hi>Trojans</hi> in the Third Book, namely, that before they had built their intended City, they ſhould be reduced by Hunger to eat their very Tables. But, when they hear that this was one of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that had been tranſmitted to the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> they will think the Poet did very well in taking Notice of it. The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian above-mentioned acquaints us, a Propheteſs had foretold <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that he ſhould take his Voyage Weſtward, till his Companions ſhould eat their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and that accordingly, upon his landing in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> as they were eating their Fleſh upon Cakes of Bread, for want of other Conveniencies, they afterwards fed on the Cakes themſelves; upon which one of the Company ſaid merrily, <hi>We are eating our Tables.</hi> They immediately took the Hint, ſays the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and concluded the Prophecy to be fulfilled. As <hi>Virgil</hi> did not think it proper to omit ſo mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial a Particular in the Hiſtory of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> it may be worth while to conſider with how much Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he has qualified it, and taken off every thing that might have appeared improper for a Paſſage in an Heroic Poem. The Propheteſs who foretells it is an hungry <hi>Harpy,</hi> as the Perſon who diſcovers it is young <hi>Aſcanius.</hi> 
               <q>

            </p>
            <p>SUCH an Obſervation, which is beautiful in the Mouth of a Boy, would have been ridiculous from any other of the Company. I am apt to think that the changing of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Fleet into Water-Nymphs, which is the moſt violent Machine in the whole <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and has given Offence to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Criticks, may be accounted for the ſame way. <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf, before he begins that Relation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that what he was going to tell appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, but that it was juſtified by Tradition. What further confirms me that this Change of the Fleet was a celebrated Circumſtance in the Hiſtory of <hi>Aeneas</hi> is, that <hi>Ovid</hi> has given a Place to the ſame <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> in his Account of the heathen Mythology.</p>
            <p>NONE of the Criticks I have met with having conſidered the Fable of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> in this Light, and taken Notice how the Tradition, on which it was founded, authorizes thoſe Parts in it which appear the moſt exceptionable; I hope the Length of this Reflection will not make it unacceptable to the curious Part of my Readers.</p>
            <p>THE Hiſtory, which was the Baſis of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Poem, is ſtill ſhorter than either that of the <hi>Iliad</hi> or <hi>Aeneid.</hi> The Poet has likewiſe taken Care to inſert every Circumſtance of it in the Body of his Fable. The Ninth Book, which we are here to conſider, is raiſed upon that brief Account in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, wherein we are told that the Serpent was more ſubtle than any Beaſt of the Field, that he tempted the Woman to eat of the forbidden Fruit, that ſhe was overcome by this Temptation, and that <hi>Adam</hi> followed her Example. From theſe few Particulars <hi>Milton</hi> has formed one of the moſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Fables that Invention ever produced. He has diſpoſed of theſe ſeveral Circumſtances among ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0106100100:112"/>
many agreeable and natural Fictions of his own, that his whole Story looks only like a Comment upon ſacred Writ, or rather ſeems to be a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Relation of what the other is only an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. I have inſiſted the longer on this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I look upon the Diſpoſitionand Contrivance of the Fable to be the principal Beauty of the Ninth Book, which has more <hi>Story</hi> in it, and is fuller of Incidents, than any other in the whole Poem. <hi>Satan</hi>'s traverſing the Globe, and ſtill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Shadow of the Night, as fearing to be diſcovered by the Angel of the Sun, who had before detected him, is one of thoſe beautiful I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations with which he introduces this his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Series of Adventures. Having examined the Nature of every Creature, and found out one which was the moſt proper for his Purpoſe, he again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to Paradiſe; and, to avoid Diſcovery, ſinks by Night with a River that ran under the Garden, and riſes up again through a Fountain that iſſued from it by the Tree of Life. The Poet, who, as we have before taken Notice, ſpeaks as little as poſſible in his own Perſon, and, after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Homer,</hi> fills every Part of his Work with Manners and Characters, introduces a Soliloquy of this infernal Agent, who was thus reſtleſs in the Deſtruction of Man. He is then deſcrib'd as gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the Garden under the Reſemblance of a Miſt, in order to find out that Creature in which he deſign'd to tempt our firſt Parents. This Deſcription has ſomething in it very poetical and ſurprizing. <q>
                  <l>So ſaying, through each Thicket dank or dry</l>
                  <l>Like a black Miſt, low creeping, he held on</l>
                  <l>His midnight Search, where ſooneſt he might find</l>
                  <l>The Serpent: him faſt ſleeping ſoon he found</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0106100100:113"/>
In Labyrinth of many a round ſelf-roll'd,</l>
                  <l>His head the midſt, well ſtor'd with ſubtle wiles.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Author afterwards gives us a Deſcription of the Morning, which is wonderfully ſuitable to a Divine Poem, and peculiar to that firſt Seaſon of Nature: He repreſents the Earth before it was curſt as a great Altar breathing out its Incenſe from all Parts, and ſending up a pleaſant Savour to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of its Creator; to which he adds a noble Idea of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> as offering their Morning Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and filling up the Univerſal Conſort of Praiſe and Adoration. <q>
                  <l>Now when as ſacred Light began to dawn</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Eden</hi> on the humid Flowers, that breathed</l>
                  <l>Their Morning Incenſe, when all things that breath</l>
                  <l>From th' Earth's great Altar ſend up ſilent Praiſe</l>
                  <l>To the Creator, and his Noſtrils fill</l>
                  <l>With grateful Smell; forth came the human Pair,</l>
                  <l>And joyn'd their vocal Worſhip to the Choir</l>
                  <l>Of Creatures wanting Voice—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Diſpute which follows between our two firſt Parents is repreſented with great Art: It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Difference of Judgment, not of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and is managed with Reaſon, not with Heat: It is ſuch a Diſpute as we may ſuppoſe might have happened in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> had Man conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued happy and innocent. There is a great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in the Moralities which are interſperſed in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſcourſe, and which the moſt ordinary Reader cannot but take Notice of. That Force of Love which the Father of Mankind ſo finely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in the Eighth Book, and which is inſerted in the foregoing Paper, ſhews it ſelf here in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine Inſtances: As in thoſe fond Regards he caſt towards <hi>Eve</hi> at her parting from him. <q>

                  <l>Solace in her Return, ſo long delay'd.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT particularly in that paſſionate Speech, where ſeeing her irrecoverably loſt, he reſolves to periſh with her rather than to live without her. <q>
                  <l>—Some curſed Fraud</l>
                  <l>Or Enemy hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,</l>
                  <l>And me with thee hath ruin'd, for with Thee</l>

                  <l>How can I live without thee, how forego</l>
                  <l>Thy ſweet Converſe, and Love ſo dearly joyn'd,</l>
                  <l>To live again in theſe wild Woods forlorn?</l>
                  <l>Should God create another <hi>Eve,</hi> and I</l>

                  <l>Would never from my Heart; no, no, I feel</l>
                  <l>The link of Nature draw me: Fleſh of Fleſh,</l>
                  <l>Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State</l>

            <p>THE Beginning of this Speech, and the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to it are animated with the ſame Spirit as the Concluſion, which I have here quoted,</p>

THE ſeveral Wiles which are put in Practice by the Tempter, when he found <hi>Eve</hi> ſeparated from her Husband, the many pleaſing Images of Nature which are intermixt in this Part of the Story, with its gradual and regular Progreſs to the fatal Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, are ſo very remarkable, that it would be ſuperfluous to point out their reſpective Beauties.</p>
            <p>I have avoided mentioning any particular Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes in my Remarks on this great Work, becauſe I have given a general Account of them in my Paper on the Firſt Book. There is one, however, in this Part of the Poem which I ſhall here quote, as it is not only very beautiful, but the cloſeſt of any in the whole Poem; I mean that where the Serpent is deſcrib'd as rolling forward in all his Pride, animated by the evil Spirit, and conducting <hi>Eve</hi> to her Deſtruction, while <hi>Adam</hi> was at too great a Diſtance from her to give her his Aſſiſtance. Theſe ſeveral Particulars are all of them wrought into the following Similitude. <q>
                  <l>—Hope elevates, and Joy</l>
                  <l>Brightens his Creſt; as when a wand'ring Fire</l>
                  <l>Compact of unctuous Vapour, which the Night</l>
                  <l>Condenſes, and the Cold invirons round,</l>
                  <l>Kindled through agitation to a Flame;</l>
                  <l>(Which oft, they ſay, ſome evil Spirit attends)</l>
                  <l>Hovering and blazing with deluſive Light,</l>
                  <l>Miſleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way</l>
                  <l>To Bogs and Mires, and oft thro' Pond or Pool,</l>
                  <l>There ſwallow'd up and loſt, from Succour far,</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THAT ſecret Intoxication of Pleaſure, with all thoſe tranſient Fluſhings of Guilt and Joy which the Poet repreſents in our firſt Parents upon their eating the forbidden Fruit, to thoſe Flaggings of Spirit, Damps of Sorrow, and mutual Accuſations which ſucceed it, are conceiv'd with a wonderful
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0106100100:116"/>
Imagination, and deſcribed in very natural Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Dido</hi> in the Fourth <hi>Aeneid</hi> yielded to that fatal Temptation which ruin'd her, <hi>Virgil</hi> tells us the Earth trembled, the Heavens were filled with Flaſhes of Lightning, and the Nymphs howled upon the Mountain Tops. <hi>Milton,</hi> in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical Spirit, has deſcribed all Nature as diſturbed upon <hi>Eve</hi>'s eating the forbidden Fruit. <q>
                  <l>So ſaying, her raſh Hand in evil Hour</l>
                  <l>Forth reaching to the Fruit, ſhe pluckt, ſhe eat:</l>
                  <l>Earth felt the Wound, and Nature from her Seat</l>
                  <l>Sighing thro' all her Works gave Signs of Woe</l>
                  <l>That all was loſt—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>UPON <hi>Adam</hi>'s falling into the ſame Guilt, the whole Creation appears a ſecond time in Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. <q>
                  <l>—He ſcrupled not to eat</l>
                  <l>Againſt his better Knowledge, not deceiv'd,</l>
                  <l>But fondly overcome with Female Charm.</l>
                  <l>Earth trembled from her Entrails, as again</l>
                  <l>In Pangs, and Nature gave a ſecond Groan,</l>
                  <l>SKY lowred, and, muttering Thunder, ſome ſad Drops</l>
                  <l>Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>AS all Nature ſuffer'd by the Guilt of our firſt Parents, theſe Symptoms of Trouble and Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are wonderfully imagined, not only as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, but as Marks of her ſympathizing in the Fall of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi>'s Converſe with <hi>Eve,</hi> after having eaten the forbidden Fruit, is an exact Copy of that between <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> in the Fourteenth <hi>Iliad. Juno</hi> there approaches <hi>Jupiter</hi> with the Girdle which ſhe had received from <hi>Venus;</hi> upon which he tells her, that ſhe appeared more charming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0106100100:117"/>
than ſhe had ever done before, even when their Loves were at the higheſt. The Poet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſcribes them as repoſing on a Summet of Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> which produced under them a Bed of Flowers, the <hi>Lotus,</hi> the <hi>Crocus,</hi> and the <hi>Hyacinth,</hi> and concludes his Deſcription with their falling aſleep.</p>
            <p>LET the Reader compare this with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſage in <hi>Milton,</hi> which begins with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Speech to <hi>Eve.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <l>For never did thy Beauty ſince the Day</l>
                  <l>I ſaw thee firſt and wedded thee, adorn'd</l>
                  <l>With all Perfections, ſo inflame my Senſe</l>
                  <l>With Ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now</l>
                  <l>Than ever, bounty of this virtuous Tree.</l>
                  <l>So ſaid be, and forbore not glance or toy</l>
                  <l>Of amorous Intent, well underſtood</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Eve,</hi> whoſe Eye darted contagious fire.</l>
                  <l>Her hand he ſeiſed, and to a ſhady bank</l>
                  <l>Thick over-head with verdant roof embowr'd</l>
                  <l>He led her nothing loath: Flow'rs were the Couch,</l>
                  <l>Panſies, and Violets, and Aſphodel,</l>
                  <l>And Hyacinth, Earth's freſheſt ſofteſt Lap.</l>
                  <l>There they their fill of Love, and Love's diſport</l>
                  <l>Took largely, of their mutual guilt the Seal,</l>
                  <l>The Solace of their Sin, till dewy Sleep</l>
                  <l>Oppreſs'd them—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>AS no Poet ſeems ever to have ſtudied <hi>Homer</hi> more, or to have reſembled him in the Greatneſs of Genius than <hi>Milton,</hi> I think I ſhould have given but a very imperfect Account of his Beauties, if I had not obſerved the moſt remarkable Paſſages which look like Parallels in theſe two great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. I might, in the Courſe of theſe Criticiſms, have taken Notice of many particular Lines and Expreſſions which are tranſlated from the <hi>Greek</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0106100100:118"/>
but as I thought this would have appeared too minute and over-curious, I have purpoſely omitted them. The greater Incidents, however, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet off by being ſhown in the ſame Light with ſeveral of the ſame Nature in <hi>Homer,</hi> but by that means may be alſo guarded againſt the Cavils of the Taſteleſs or Ignorant.</p>

            <p>THE Tenth Book of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> has a greater Variety of Perſons in it than any other in the whole Poem. The Author upon the winding up of his Action introduces all thoſe who had any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in it, and ſhews with great Beauty the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which it had upon each of them. It is like the laſt Act of a well written Tragedy, in which all who had a Part in it are generally drawn up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Audience, and repreſented under thoſe Circumſtances in which the Determination of the Action places them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore conſider this Book under four Heads, in relation to the Celeſtial, the Infernal, the Human, and the Imaginary Perſons, who have their reſpective Parts allotted in it.</p>
            <p>TO begin with the Celeſtial Perſons: The Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angels of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> are deſcribed as returning to Heaven upon the Fall of Man, in order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Vigilance; their Arrival, their Manner of Reception, with the Sorrow which appeared in themſelves, and in thoſe Spirits who are ſaid to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0106100100:119"/>
Rejoice at the Converſion of a Sinner, are very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid together in the following Lines. <q>
                  <l>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p into Heav'n from Paradiſe in haſte</l>
                  <l>Th' angelick guards aſcended, mute and ſad</l>
                  <l>For Man, for of his ſtate by this they knew,</l>
                  <l>Much wond'ring how the ſubtle Fiend had ſtoln</l>
                  <l>Entrance unſeen. Soon as th' unwelcome news</l>
                  <l>From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, diſpleas'd</l>
                  <l>All were who heard, dim ſadneſs did not ſpare</l>
                  <l>That time Celeſtial viſages, yet mixt</l>
                  <l>With pity, violated not their Bliſs.</l>
                  <l>About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes</l>
                  <l>Th' Aethereal People ran, to hear and know</l>
                  <l>How all befell: They tow'rds the Throne ſupream</l>
                  <l>Accountable made haſte to make appear</l>
                  <l>With righteous plea, their utmoſt vigilance,</l>
                  <l>And eaſily approv'd; when the moſt High</l>
                  <l>Eternal Father from his ſecret Cloud</l>
                  <l>Amidſt, in thunder utter'd thus his Voice.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame Divine Perſon, who in the foregoing Parts of this Poem interceded for our firſt Parents before their Fall, overthrew the Rebel Angels, and created the World, is now repreſented as deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and pronouncing Sentence upon the three Offenders. The cool of the Evening, being a Circumſtance with which Holy Writ introduces this great Scene, it is Poetically deſcribed by our Author, who has alſo kept religiouſly to the Form of Words, in which the three ſeveral Sentences were paſſed upon <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and the Serpent. He has rather choſen to neglect the Numerouſneſs of his Verſe, than to deviate from thoſe Speeches which are recorded on this great Occaſion. The Guilt and Confuſion of our firſt Parents ſtanding naked before their Judge, is touched with great Beauty. Upon the Arrival of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> into the Works
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0106100100:120"/>
of the Creation, the Almighty is again introduced as ſpeaking to his Angels that ſurrounded him. <q>
                  <l>See with what heat theſe Dogs of Hell advance</l>
                  <l>To waſte and havock yonder World, which I</l>
                  <l>So fair and good Created, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE following Paſſage is formed upon that glorious Image in Holy Writ, which compares the Voice of an innumerable Hoſt of Angels, uttering Hallelujahs, to the Voice of mighty Thunderings, or of many Waters. <q>
                  <l>He ended, and the Heav'nly Audience loud</l>
                  <l>Sung Hallelujah, as the ſound of Seas,</l>
                  <l>Through multitude that ſung: "Juſt are thy ways,</l>
                  <l>"Righteous are thy Decrees in all thy Works,</l>
                  <l>"Who can extenuate Thee—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH the Author in the whole Courſe of his Poem, and particularly in the Book we are now examining, has infinite Alluſions to Places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I have only taken notice in my Remarks of ſuch as are of a Poetical Nature, and which are woven with great Beauty into the Body of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Of this kind is that Paſſage in the preſent Book, where deſcribing <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> as marching through the works of Nature, he adds, <q>
                  <l>—Behind her <hi>Death</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Cloſe following pace for pace, not mounted yet</l>
                  <l>On his pale Horſe!—</l>
               </q> Which alludes to that Paſſage in Scripture ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Poetical, and terrifying to the Imagination. <hi>And I looked, and behold a pale Horſe, and his Name that ſat on him was</hi> Death, <hi>and</hi> Hell <hi>followed with him: and Power was given unto them over the fourth Part of the Earth to kill with Sword, and with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and with Sickneſs, and with the Beaſts of the Earth.</hi> Under this firſt Head of Celeſtial Perſons
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0106100100:121"/>
we muſt likewiſe take Notice of the Command which the Angels received, to produce the ſeveral Changes in Nature, and ſully the Beauty of the Creation. Accordingly they are repreſented as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Stars and Planets with malignant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, weakning the Light of the Sun, bringing down the Winter into the milder Regions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, planting Winds and Storms in ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sky, ſtoring the Clouds with Thunder, and in ſhort, perverting the whole Frame of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe to the Condition of its Criminal Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. As this is a noble Incident in the Poem, the following Lines, in which we ſee the Angels heaving up the Earth, and placing it in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Poſture to the Sun from what it had before the Fall of Man, is conceived with that ſublime Imagination which was ſo peculiar to this great Author. <q>
                  <l>Some ſay he bid his Angels turn aſcance</l>
                  <l>The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more</l>
                  <l>From the Sun's Axle; they with labour puſh'd</l>
                  <l>Oblique the Centrick Globe.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>WE are in the ſecond Place, to conſider the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Agents under the View which <hi>Milton</hi> has given us of them in this Book. It is obſerved by thoſe who would ſet forth the Greatneſs of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Plan, that he conducts his Reader through all the Parts of the Earth which were diſcovered in his Time. <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> are the ſeveral Scenes of his Fable. The Plan of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Poem is of an infinitely greater Extent, and fills the Mind with many more aſtoniſhing Circumſtances. <hi>Satan,</hi> having ſurrounded the Earth ſeven times, departs at length from <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> We then ſee him ſteering his Courſe among the Conſtellations, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving traverſed the whole Creation, purſuing his Voyage thro' the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and entering into his own Infernal Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0106100100:122"/>
HIS firſt Appearance in the Aſſembly of Fallen Angels, is work'd up with Circumſtances which give a delightful Surprize to the Reader; but there is no Incident in the whole Poem which does this more than the Transformation of the whole Audience, that follows the Account their Leader gives them of his Expedition. The gradual Change of <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf is deſcribed after <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Manner, and may vie with any of thoſe celebrated Transformations which are looked upon as the moſt Beautiful Parts in that Poet's Works. <hi>Milton</hi> never fails of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his own Hints, and beſtowing the laſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Touches to every Incident which is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into his Poem. The unexpected Hiſs which riſes in this Epiſode, the Dimenſions and Bulk of <hi>Satan</hi> ſo much ſuperior to thoſe of the Infernal Spirits who lay under the ſame Transformation, with the annual Change which they are ſuppoſed to ſuffer, are Inſtances of this Kind. The Beauty of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is very remarkable in this whole Epiſode, as I have obſerved in the Sixth Paper of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks the great Judgment with which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived.</p>
            <p>THE Parts of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> or the Humane Perſons, come next under our Conſideration. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Art is no where more ſhewn than in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the Parts of theſe our firſt Parents. The Repreſentation he gives of them, without falſifying the Story, is wonderfully contrived to influence the Reader with Pity and Compaſſion towards them. Though <hi>Adam</hi> involves the whole Species in Miſery, his Crime proceeds from a Weakneſs which every Man is inclined to pardon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate, as it ſeems rather the Frailty of Humane Nature, than of the Perſon who offended. Every one is apt to excuſe a Fault which he himſelf might have fallen into. It was the Exceſs of Love for <hi>Eve</hi> that ruin'd <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity. I need
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0106100100:123"/>
not add, that the Author is Juſtify'd in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by many of the Fathers, and the moſt Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Writers. <hi>Milton</hi> has by this means filled a great part of his Poem with that kind of Writing which the <hi>French</hi> Criticks call the <hi>Tender,</hi> and which is in a particular manner engaging to all ſorts of Readers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> in the Book we are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, are likewiſe drawn with ſuch Sentiments as do not only intereſt the Reader in their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but raiſe in him the moſt melting Paſſions of Humanity and Commiſeration. When <hi>Adam</hi> ſees the ſeveral Changes in Nature produced about him, he appears in a Diſorder of Mind ſuitable to one who had forfeited both his Innocence and his Happineſs: he is filled with Horror, Remorſe, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; in the Anguiſh of his Heart he expoſtulates with his Creator for having given him an unasked Exiſtence. <q>
                  <l>Did I requeſt thee, Maker, from my Clay</l>
                  <l>To mould me Man, did I ſolicit thee</l>
                  <l>From darkneſs to promote me, or here place</l>
                  <l>In this delicious Garden? as my will</l>
                  <l>Concurr'd not to my being, 'twere but right</l>
                  <l>And equal to reduce me to my duſt,</l>

               <hi>ADAM</hi>'s Reconcilement to her is work'd up in the ſame Spirit of Tenderneſs. <hi>Eve</hi> afterwards propoſes to her Husband, in the Blindneſs of her Deſpair, that to prevent their Guilt from deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Poſterity they ſhould reſolve to live Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; or, if that could not be done, they ſhould ſeek their own Deaths by violent Methods. As thoſe Sentiments naturally engage the Reader to regard the Mother of Mankind with more than ordinary Commiſeration, they likewiſe contain a very fine Moral. The Reſolution of Dying, to end our Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, does not ſhew ſuch a degree of Magnanimity as a Reſolution to bear them, and ſubmit to the Diſpenſations of Providence. Our Author has therefore, with great Delicacy, repreſented <hi>Eve</hi> as entertaining this Thought, and <hi>Adam</hi> as diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it.</p>
            <p>WE are, in the laſt Place, to conſider the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Perſons, or <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> who act a large Part in this Book. Such beautiful extended Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are certainly ſome of the fineſt Compoſitions of Genius; but, as I have before obſerved, are not agreeable to the Nature of an Heroic Poem. This of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> is very exquiſite in its Kind, if not conſidered as a Part of ſuch a Work. The Truths contained in it are ſo clear and open, that I ſhall not loſe Time in explaining them; but ſhall only obſerve, that a Reader who knows the Strength of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, will be amazed to think how the Poet could find ſuch apt Words and Phraſes to deſcribe the Actions of thoſe two imaginary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and particularly in that Part where <hi>Death</hi> is exhibited as forming a Bridge over the <hi>Chaos;</hi> a Work ſuitable to the Genius of <hi>Milton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE the Subject I am upon gives me an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſpeaking more at large of ſuch Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy and Imaginary Perſons as may be introduced into Heroic Poems, I ſhall beg Leave to explain my
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0106100100:127"/>
ſelf in a Matter which is curious in its Kind, and which none of the Criticks have treated of. It is certain <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are full of imaginary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are very beautiful in Poetry when they are juſt ſhewn without being engaged in any Series of Action. <hi>Homer</hi> indeed repreſents <hi>Sleep</hi> as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and aſcribes a ſhort Part to him in his <hi>Iliad;</hi> but we muſt conſider that tho' we now regard ſuch a Perſon as entirely ſhadowy and unſubſtantial, the Heathens made Statues of him, placed him in their Temples, and looked upon him as a Real Deity. When <hi>Homer</hi> makes uſe of other ſuch Allegorical Perſons, it is only in ſhort Expreſſions, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey an ordinary Thought to the Mind in the moſt pleaſing Manner, and may rather be looked upon as Poetical Phraſes than Allegorical Deſcriptions. Inſtead of telling us that Men naturally fly when they are terrified, he introduces the Perſons of <hi>Flight</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> who, he tells us, are inſeparable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Inſtead of ſaying that the Time was come when <hi>Apollo</hi> ought to have received his Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, he tells us that the <hi>Hours</hi> brought him his Reward. Inſtead of deſcribing the Effects which <hi>Minerva</hi>'s <hi>Aegis</hi> produced in Battel, he tells us that the Brims of it were encompaſſed by <hi>Terrour, Rout, Diſcord, Fury, Purſuit, Maſſacre,</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> In the ſame Figure of ſpeaking, he repreſents <hi>Victory</hi> as following <hi>Diomedes; Diſcord</hi> as the Mother of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and Mourning; <hi>Venus</hi> as dreſſed by the <hi>Graces; Bellona</hi> as wearing Terrour and Conſternation like a Garment. I might give ſeveral other Inſtances out of <hi>Homer,</hi> as well as a great many out of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil. Milton</hi> has likewiſe very often made uſe of the ſame way of Speaking, as where he tells us, that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> ſat on the Right Hand of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> when he marched forth againſt the Rebel Angels; that at the riſing of the Sun the <hi>Hours</hi> unbarr'd the Gates of Light; that <hi>Diſcord</hi> was the Daughter of <hi>Sin.</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0106100100:128"/>
Of the ſame Nature are thoſe Expreſſions, where deſcribing the Singing of the Nightingale, he adds, <hi>Silence was pleaſed;</hi> and upon the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s bidding Peace to the <hi>Chaos, Confuſion heard his Voice.</hi> I might add innumerable Inſtances of our Poet's writing in this beautiful Figure. It is plain that theſe I have mentioned, in which Perſons of an imaginary Nature are introduced, are ſuch ſhort Allegories as are not deſigned to be taken in the literal Senſe, but only to convey particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to the Reader after an unuſual and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining Manner. But when ſuch Perſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced as principal Actors, and engaged in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Adventures, they take too much upon them, and are by no means proper for an Heroic Poem, which ought to appear credible in its principal Parts. I cannot forbear therefore thinking that <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> are as improper Agents in a Work of this Nature, as <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> in one of the Tragedies of <hi>Eſchylus,</hi> who repreſented thoſe two Perſons nailing down <hi>Prometheus</hi> to a Rock, for which he has been juſtly cenſured by the greateſt Criticks. I do not know any imaginary Perſon made uſe of in a more ſublime manner of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than that in one of the Prophets, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing God as deſcending from Heaven, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the Sins of Mankind, adds that dreadful Circumſtance, <hi>Before him went the Peſtilence.</hi> It is certain this imaginary Perſon might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in all her purple Spots. The <hi>Fever</hi> might have marched before her, <hi>Pain</hi> might have ſtood at her Right Hand, <hi>Phrenzy</hi> on her Left, and <hi>Death</hi> in her Rear. She might have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as gliding down from the Tail of a Comet, or darted upon the Earth in a Flaſh of Lightning: She might have tainted the Atmoſphere with her Breath; the very Glaring of her Eyes might have ſcattered. Infection. But I believe every Reader will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0106100100:129"/>
think, that in ſuch ſublime Writings the mentioning of her as it is done in Scripture, has ſomething in it more juſt, as well as great, than all that the moſt fanciful Poet could have beſtowed upon her in the Richneſs of his Imagination.</p>

put out his own Eyes, inſtead of breaking his Neck from the Palace Battlements (which furniſhes ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant an Entertainment for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Audience) deſires that he may be conducted to Mount <hi>Cithae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> in order to end his Life in that very Place where he was expoſed in his Infancy, and where he ſhould then have died, had the Will of his Parents been executed.</p>

               <hi>ADAM</hi>'s Speech abounds with Thoughts which are equally moving, but of a more maſculine and elevated Turn. Nothing can be conceived more ſublime and poetical than the following Paſſage in it. <q>
                  <l>This moſt afflicts me, that departing hence</l>

                  <l>To life prolong'd and promiſed race I nòw</l>
                  <l>Gladly behold though but his utmoſt Skirts</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Angel afterwards leads <hi>Adam</hi> to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mount of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and lays before him a whole Hemiſphere, as a proper Stage for thoſe Viſions which were to be repreſented on it. I have before obſerved how the Plan of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Poem is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars greater than that of the <hi>Iliad</hi> or <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid. Virgil</hi>'s Hero, in the laſt of theſe Poems, is entertained with a ſight of all theſe who are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from him; but tho' that Epiſode is juſtly admired as one of the nobleſt Deſigns in the whole <hi>Aeneid,</hi> every one muſt allow that this of <hi>Milton</hi> is of a much higher Nature. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Viſion is not confined to any particular Tribe of Mankind, but extends to the whole Species.</p>
            <p>IN this great Review which <hi>Adam</hi> takes of all his Sons and Daughters, the firſt Objects he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with exhibit to him the Story of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> which is drawn together with much Cloſeneſs and Propriety of Expreſſion. That Curioſity and natural Horror which ariſes in <hi>Adam</hi> at the Sight of the firſt Dying Man, is touched with great Beauty. <q>
                  <l>But have I now ſeen Death? is this the way</l>
                  <l>I muſt return to native duſt? O Sight</l>
                  <l>Of terrour foul and ugly to behold,</l>
                  <l>Horrid to Think, how horrible to Feel!</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſecond Viſion ſets before him the Image of Death in a great Variety of Appearances. The Angel, to give him a general Idea of thoſe Effects which his Guilt had brought upon his Poſterity, places before him a large Hoſpital, or Lazar-Houſe,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0106100100:135"/>
fill'd with Perſons lying under all kinds of mortal Diſeaſes. How finely has the Poet told us that the ſick Perſons languiſhed under lingring and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſtempers, by an apt and judicious uſe of ſuch imaginary Beings as thoſe I mentioned in my laſt Paper. <q>
                  <l>Dire was the toſſing, deep the Groans, <hi>Deſpair</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Tended the Sick, buſy from Couch to Couch;</l>
                  <l>And over them triumphant <hi>Death</hi> his dart</l>
                  <l>Shook, but delay'd to ſtrike, though oft invoked</l>
                  <l>With Vows as their chief good and final hope.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Paſſion which likewiſe riſes in <hi>Adam</hi> on this occaſion is very natural. <q>
                  <l>Sight ſo deform what Heart of rock could long</l>
                  <l>Dry-eyed behold? <hi>Adam</hi> could not, but wept,</l>
                  <l>Tho' not of Woman born; Compaſſion quell'd</l>
                  <l>His beſt of Man, and gave him up to tears.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Diſcourſe between the Angel and <hi>Adam</hi> which follows, abounds with noble Morals.</p>
            <p>AS there is nothing more delightful in Poetry than a Contraſt and Oppoſition of Incidents, the Author, after this melancholy Proſpect of Death and Sickneſs, raiſes up a Scene of Mirth, Love and Jollity. The ſecret Pleaſure that ſteals into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Heart as he is intent upon this Viſion, is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined with great Delicacy. I muſt not omit the Deſcription of the looſe female Troupe, who ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Sons of God as they are called in Scripture. <q>
                  <l>For that fair female troupe thou ſaw'ſt, that ſeem'd</l>
                  <l>Of Goddeſſes, ſo blithe, ſo ſmooth, ſo gay,</l>
                  <l>Yet empty of all good, wherein conſiſts</l>
                  <l>Woman's domeſtick honour and chief praiſe;</l>
                  <l>Bred only and compleated to the taſte</l>
                  <l>Of luſtful appetence, to ſing, to dance,</l>
                  <l>To dreſs and troule the Tongue, and roul the Eye.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0106100100:136"/>
To theſe that ſober race of Men, whoſe lives</l>
                  <l>Religious titled them the Sons of God,</l>
                  <l>Shall yield up all their Virtue, all their Fame</l>
                  <l>Ignobly to the Trains and to the ſmiles</l>
                  <l>Of thoſe fair Atheiſts—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE next Viſion is of a quite contrary Nature, and filled with the Horrors of War. <hi>Adam</hi> at the Sight of it melts into Tears, and breaks out in that paſſionate Speech, <q>
                  <l>—O what are theſe</l>
                  <l>Death's miniſters, not Men: who thus deal death</l>
                  <l>Inhumanly to Men, and multiply</l>
                  <l>Ten thouſand fold the Sin of him who flew</l>
                  <l>His Brother: for of whom ſuch Maſſacre</l>
                  <l>Make they but of their Brethren, Men of Men?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON,</hi> to keep up an agreeable Variety in his Viſions, after having raiſed in the Mind of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeveral Ideas of Terror which are conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Deſcription of War: paſſes on to thoſe ſofter Images of Triumphs and Feſtivals, in that Viſion of Lewdneſs and Luxury which uſhers in the Flood.</p>
            <p>AS it is viſible that the Poet had his Eye upon <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Account of the univerſal Deluge, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obſerve with how much Judgment he has avoided every thing that is redundant or puerile in the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet. We do not here ſee the Wolf ſwimming among the Sheep, nor any of thoſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Imaginations which <hi>Seneca</hi> found fault with, as unbecoming the great Cataſtrophe of Nature. If our Poet has imitated that Verſe in which <hi>Ovid</hi> tells us that there was nothing but Sea, and that this Sea had no Shore to it, he has not ſet the Thought in ſuch a Light as to incur the Cenſure which Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks have paſſed upon it. The latter part of that Verſe in <hi>Ovid</hi> is idle and ſuperfluous, but juſt and beautiful in <hi>Milton.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0106100100:137"/>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IN <hi>Milton</hi> the former part of the Deſcription does not foreſtall the latter. How much more great and ſolemn on this Occaſion is that which follows in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet, <q>
                  <l>—And in their Palaces</l>
                  <l>Where Luxury late reign'd, Sea Monſters whelp'd</l>
                  <l>And ſtabl'd—</l>
               </q> than that in <hi>Ovid,</hi> where we are told that the Sea-Calfs lay in thoſe Places where the Goats were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to browze? The Reader may find ſeveral other parallel paſſages in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deluge; wherein our Poet has viſibly the Advantage. The Sky's being over charged with Clouds, the deſcending of the Rains, the riſing of the Seas, and the appearance of the Rainbow, are ſuch Deſcriptions as every one muſt take Notice of. The Circumſtance relating to <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is ſo finely imagined and ſuitable to the Opinions of many learned Authors, that I cannot forbear giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a Place in this Paper. <q>
                  <l>—Then ſhall this mount</l>
                  <l>Of Paradiſe by might of waves be mov'd</l>
                  <l>Out of his place, puſh'd by the horned ſtood,</l>
                  <l>With all his verdure ſpoil'd, and trees adrift</l>
                  <l>Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,</l>
                  <l>And there take root an Iſland ſalt and bare,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Tranſition which the Poet makes from the Viſion of the Deluge, to the Concern it occaſioned in <hi>Adam,</hi> is exquiſitely graceful, and copied after
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0106100100:138"/>
               <hi>Virgil,</hi> though the firſt Thought it introduces is rather in the Spirit of <hi>Ovid.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have been the more particular in my Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the Eleventh Book of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> becauſe it is not generally reckoned among the moſt ſhining Books of this Poem; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Reader might be apt to overlook thoſe many Paſſages in it which deſerve our Admiration. The Eleventh and Twelfth are indeed built upon that ſingle Circumſtance of the Removal of our firſt Parents from <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> but though this is not in it ſelf ſo great a Subject as that in moſt of the foregoing Books, it is extended and diverſified with ſo many ſurprizing Incidents and pleaſing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſodes, that theſe two laſt Books can by no means be looked upon as unequal Parts of this Divine Poem. I muſt further add, that had not <hi>Milton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented our firſt Parents as driven out of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> his Fall of Man would not have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and conſequently his Action would have been imperfect.</p>

               <hi>MILTON,</hi> after having repreſented in Viſion the Hiſtory of Mankind to the firſt great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of Nature, diſpatches the remaining Part of it in Narration. He has deviſed a very handſome Reaſon for the Angel's proceeding with <hi>Adam</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; though doubtleſs the true Reaſon was the Difficulty which the Poet would have found to have ſhadowed out ſo mix'd and complicated a Story in viſible Objects. I could wiſh, however, that the Author had done it, whatever Pains it might have coſt him. To give my Opinion free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I think that the exhibiting part of the Hiſtory of Mankind in Viſion, and part in Narrative, is as if an Hiſtory-Painter ſhould put in Colours one half of his Subject, and write down the remaining part of it. If <hi>Milton</hi>'s Poem flags any where, it is in this Narration, where in ſome Places the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has been ſo attentive to his Divinity, that he has neglected his Poetry. The Narration, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, riſes very happily on ſeveral Occaſions, where the Subject is capable of Poetical Ornaments, as particularly in the Confuſion which he deſcribes among the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> and in his ſhort Sketch of the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The Storm of Hail and Fire, with the Darkneſs that overſpread the Land for three Days, are deſcribed with great Strength. The beautiful Paſſage which follows, is raiſed upon noble Hints in Scripture. <q>

This Alluſion is taken from that ſublime Paſſage in <hi>Ezekiel; Thus ſaith the Lord God, behold I am againſt thee</hi> Pharoah <hi>King of</hi> Egypt, <hi>the great Dragon that lieth in the midſt of his Rivers, which hath ſaid, My River is mine own, and I have made it for my ſelf. Milton</hi> has given us another very noble and poetical Image in the ſame Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is copied almoſt Word for Word out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

            <p>AS the principal Deſign of this <hi>Epiſode</hi> was to give <hi>Adam</hi> an Idea of the Holy Perſon, who was to re-inſtate Humane Nature in that Happineſs and Perfection from which it had fallen, the Poet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines himſelf to the Line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whence the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to deſcend. The Angel is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0106100100:141"/>
as ſeeing the Patriarch actually travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> which gives a particular Livelineſs to this Part of the Narration. <q>
                  <l>I ſee him, but thou canſt not, with what Faith</l>
                  <l>He leaves his Gods, his Friends, his native Soil</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ur</hi> of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> paſſing now the Ford</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Haran,</hi> after him a cumbrous train</l>
                  <l>Of Herds and Flocks and numerous ſervitude;</l>
                  <l>Not wand' ring poor, but truſting all his wealth</l>
                  <l>With God who call'd him, in a Land unknown.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Canaan</hi> he now attains, I ſee his Tents</l>
                  <l>Pitcht about <hi>Sechem,</hi> and the neighbouring Plain</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Moroh,</hi> there by promiſe he receives</l>
                  <l>Gift to his progeny of all that Land,</l>
                  <l>From <hi>Hamath</hi> Northward to the deſert South,</l>
                  <l>(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed.)</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>AS <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Viſion in the Sixth <hi>Aeneid</hi> probably gave <hi>Milton</hi> the Hint of this whole <hi>Epiſode,</hi> the laſt Line is a Tranſlation of that Verſe, where <hi>Anchiſes</hi> mentions the Names of Places, which they were to bear hereafter. <q>
                  <l>Hac tum nomina erunt, nunc ſunt ſine nomine terrae.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Poet has very finely repreſented the Joy and Gladneſs of Heart which riſes in <hi>Adam</hi> upon his Diſcovery of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> As he ſees his Day at a Diſtance through Types and Shadows, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices in it; but when he finds the Redemption of Man compleated, and <hi>Paradiſe</hi> again renewed, he breaks forth in Rapture and Tranſport, <q>
                  <l>O goodneſs infinite, goodneſs immenſe!</l>
                  <l>That all this good of evil ſhall produce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have hinted in my Sixth Paper on <hi>Milton,</hi> that an Heroick Poem, according to the Opinion of the beſt Criticks, ought to end happily, and leave the Mind of the Reader, after having conducted it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0106100100:142"/>
through many Doubts and Fears, Sorrows and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes, in a ſtate of Tranquility and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Fable, which had ſo many other Qualifications to recommend it, was deficient in this Particular. It is here therefore, that the Poet has ſhewn a moſt exquiſite Judgment, as well as the fineſt Invention, by finding out a Method to ſupply this natural Defect in his Subject. Accordingly he leaves the Adverſary of Mankind, in the laſt View which he gives us of him, under the loweſt State of Mortification and Diſappointment. We ſee him chewing Aſhes, grovelling in the Duſt, and loaden with ſupernumerary Pains and Torments. On the contrary, our two firſt Parents are comforted by Dreams and Viſions, cheared with promiſes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and, in a manner, raiſed to a greater Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than that which they had forfeited: In ſhort, <hi>Satan</hi> is repreſented miſerable in the Height of his Triumphs, and <hi>Adam</hi> triumphant in the Height of Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MILTON</hi>'s Poem ends very nobly. The laſt Speeches of <hi>Adam</hi> and the Arch-Angel are full of Moral and Inſtructive Sentiments. The Sleep that fell upon <hi>Eve,</hi> and the Effects it had in quieting the Diſorders of her Mind, produces the ſame kind of Conſolation in the Reader, who cannot peruſe the laſt beautiful Speech which is aſcribed to the Mother of Mankind, without a ſecret Pleaſure and Satisfaction. <q>
                  <l>Whence thou return'ſt, and whither went'ſt, I know;</l>
                  <l>For God is alſo in Sleep; and Dreams adviſe,</l>
                  <l>Which he hath ſent propitious, ſome great good</l>
                  <l>Preſaging, ſince with Sorrow and Heart's diſtreſs</l>
                  <l>Wearied I fell aſleep: but now lead on;</l>
                  <l>In me is no delay: with thee to go</l>
                  <l>Is to ſtay here; without thee here to ſtay</l>
                  <l>Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0106100100:143"/>
Art all things under Heav'n, all Places thou</l>
                  <l>Who for my wilful Crime are baniſh'd hence.</l>
                  <l>This farther Conſolation yet ſecure</l>
                  <l>I carry hence; though all by me is loſt,</l>
                  <l>Such Favour, I unworthy, am vouchſaf'd,</l>
                  <l>By me the promiſed Seed ſhall all reſtore.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE following Lines, which conclude the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, riſe in a moſt glorious Blaze of Poetical Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HELIODOR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> in his <hi>Aeshiopicks</hi> acquaints us, that the Motion of the Gods differs from that of Mortals, as the former do not ſtir their Feet, nor proceed Step by Step, but ſlide o'er the Surface of the Earth by an uniform Swimming of the whole Body. The Reader may obſerve with how Poetical a Deſcription <hi>Milton</hi> has attributed the ſame kind of Motion to the Angels who were to take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <l>So ſpake our Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> heard</l>
                  <l>Well pleas'd, but anſwer'd not; for now too nigh</l>
                  <l>Th' Arch-Angel ſtood, and from the other Hill</l>
                  <l>To their fix'd ſtation, all in bright array</l>
                  <l>The Cherubim deſcended; on the Ground</l>
                  <l>Gliding meteorons, as ev'ning miſt</l>
                  <l>Ris'n from a River, o'er the mariſh glides,</l>
                  <l>And gathers ground faſt at the lab'rer's heel</l>
                  <l>Homeward returning. High in Front advanc'd</l>
                  <l>The brandiſh'd Sword of God before them blaz'd</l>
                  <l>Fierce as a Comet—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Author helped his Invention in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paſſage, by reflecting on the Behaviour of the Angel, who, in Holy Writ, has the Conduct of <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family. The Circumſtances drawn from that Relation are very gracefully made uſe of on this Occaſion. <q>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0106100100:144"/>
                  <l>In either hand the haſtning Angel caught</l>
                  <l>Our ling'ring Parents, and to the Eaſtern gate</l>
                  <l>Led them direct; and down the Cliff as faſt</l>
                  <l>To the ſubjected plain; then diſappear'd.</l>
                  <l>They looking back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Scene which our firſt Parents are ſurprized with upon their looking back on <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtrikes the Reader's Imagination, as nothing can be more natural than the Tears they ſhed or that Occaſion. <q>
                  <l>They looking back, all th' Eaſtern ſide beheld</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſo late their happy Seat,</l>
                  <l>Wav'd over by the flaming brand, the gate</l>
                  <l>With dreadful faces throng'd and fiery Arms:</l>
                  <l>Some natural tears they dropp'd, but wiped them ſoon.</l>
                  <l>The world was all before them, where to chuſe</l>
                  <l>Their place of reſt, and Providence their Guide.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IF I might preſume to offer at the ſmalleſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in this Divine Work, I ſhould think the Poem would end better with the Paſſage here quoted, than with the two Verſes which follow. <q>
                  <l>They hand in hand with wandering ſteps and ſlow,</l>
                  <l>Through <hi>Eden</hi> took their ſolitary way.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE two Verſes, though they have their Beauty, fall very much below the foregoing Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and renew in the Mind of the Reader that Anguiſh which was pretty well laid by that Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. <q>
                  <l>The World was all before them, where to chuſe</l>
                  <l>Their place of reſt, and Providence their Guide.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Number of Books in <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> is equal to thoſe of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> Our Author in his Firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had divided his Poem into Ten Books, but afterwards broke the Seventh and the Eleventh
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0106100100:145"/>
each of them into two different Books, by the Help of ſome ſmall Additions. This ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was made with great Judgment, as any one may ſee who will be at the pains of examining it. It was not done for the ſake of ſuch a Chimerical Beauty as that of reſembling <hi>Virgil</hi> in this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but for the more juſt and regular Diſpoſition of this great Work.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have read <hi>Boſſu,</hi> and many of the Criticks who have written ſince his Time, will not pardon me if I do not find out the particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral which is inculcated in <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi> Though I can by no means think, with the laſt-mentioned <hi>French</hi> Author, that an Epic Writer firſt of all pitches upon a certain Moral, as the Ground-Work and Foundation of his Poem, and afterwards finds out a Story to it: I am, however, of Opinion, that no juſt Heroic Poem ever was, or can be made, from whence one great Moral may not be deduced. That which reigns in <hi>Milton</hi> is the moſt univerſal and moſt uſeful that can be imagined; it is in ſhort this, <hi>that Obedience to the Will of God makes Men happy, and that Diſobedience makes them miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> This is viſibly the Moral of the principal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which turns upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> while they kept the Command that was given them, and were driven out of it as ſoon as they had tranſgreſſed. This is likewiſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the principal Epiſode, which ſhews us how an innumerable Multitude of Angels fell from their State of Bliſs, and were caſt into Hell upon their Diſobedience. Beſides this great Moral, which may be looked upon as the Soul of the Fable, there are an Infinity of Under Morals which are to be drawn from the ſeveral Parts of the Poem, and which makes this Work more uſeful and inſtructive than any other Poem in any Language.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0106100100:146"/>
THOSE who have Criticiſed on the <hi>Odiſſey,</hi> the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and <hi>Aeneid,</hi> have taken a great deal of Pains to fix the Number of Months or Days contained in the Action of each of thoſe Poems. If any one thinks it worth his while to examine this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in <hi>Milton,</hi> he will find that from <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Appearance in the Fourth Book, to his Expulſion from <hi>Paradiſe</hi> in the Twelfth, the Author reckons ten Days. As for that Part of the Action which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the three firſt Books, as it does not paſs within the Regions of Nature, I have before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it is not ſubject to any Calculations of Time.</p>
            <p>I have now finiſhed my Obſervations on a Work which does an Honour to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. I have taken a general View of it under thoſe four Heads, the Fable, the Characters, the Sentiments, and the Language, and made each of them the Subject of a particular Paper. I have in the next place ſpoken of the Cenſures which our Author may incur under each of theſe Heads, which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to two Papers, though I might have enlarged the Number, if I had been diſpoſed to dwell on ſo ungrateful a Subject. I believe, however, that the ſevereſt Reader will not find any little Fault in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Poetry, which this Author has fallen into, that does not come under one of thoſe Heads among which I have diſtributed his ſeveral Blemiſhes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having thus treated at large of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> I could not think it ſufficient to have celebrated this Poem in the whole, without deſcending to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. I have therefore beſtowed a Paper upon each Book, and endeavoured not only to prove that the Poem is beautiful in general, but to point out its particular Beauties, and to determine wherein they conſiſt. I have endeavoured to ſhew how ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are beautiful by being Sublime; others by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soft; others by being Natural: which of them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0106100100:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are recommended by the Paſſion; which by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which by the Sentiment, and which by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. I have likewiſe endeavoured to ſhew how the Genius of the Poet ſhines by a happy Invention; a diſtant Alluſion; or a judicious Imitation: how he has copied or improved <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> and raiſed his own Imaginations by the Uſe which he has made of ſeveral Poetical Paſſages in Scripture. I might have inſerted alſo ſeveral Paſſages of <hi>Taſſo,</hi> which our Author has imitated; but as I do not look upon <hi>Taſſo</hi> to be a ſufficient Voucher, I would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex my Reader with ſuch Quotations, as might do more Honour to the <hi>Italian</hi> than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet. In ſhort, I have endeavoured to particularize thoſe innumerable Kinds of Beauty, which it would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to recapitulate, but which are eſſential to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, and which may be met with in the Works of this great Author. Had I thought, at my firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in this Deſign, that it would have led me to ſo great a Length, I believe I ſhould never have entred upon it; but the kind Reception which it has met with among thoſe whoſe Judgments I have a Value for, give me no Reaſon to repent of the pains I have been at in compoſing them.</p>
