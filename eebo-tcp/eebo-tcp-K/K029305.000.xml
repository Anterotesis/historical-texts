            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SOME copies of ſpurious impreſſions of the Cozeners and the Maid of Bath, having been printed and circulated before the application to the Court of Chancery for an Injunction, it has been thought adviſable, in vindication of the property of the Editor, as well as in juſtice to the deceaſed Author, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to commit to the preſs genuine editions of the two dramatick pieces above-mentioned, together with THIS COMEDY, which had been alſo without authority advertiſed for publication.</p>
            <p>On inſpection of the ſpurious impreſſions, it appears, that all the errors of careleſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant tranſcribers are there religiouſly preſerved; and all the additions and improvements, made by the facetious Writer, are omitted. Many inſtances of this will occur on peruſal of thoſe Comedies, and particularly the Cozeners; in which, beſides the reſtoration of ſeveral paſſages always ſpoken on the ſtage, the Reader will find a whole ſcene, at the end of the Firſt Act, and
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0291600200:4"/>
another, ſtill more entertaining and popular, at the beginning of the Third; both which were wholly wanting in the ſpurious Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>Unauthorized publications are not only always detrimental to private property, but commonly prove injurious to the publick: For the copies, being obtained by clandeſtine and indirect means, are, for the moſt part, as has happened in the preſent inſtance, incorrect and imperfect.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Dignity! and what occaſion for dignity in tne common concerns of my houſe? why the deuce can't you converſe like the reſt of the world? If you want money to pay off my bills, you move me for further ſupplies; if I turn away a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0291600200:7"/>
ſervant, you condemn me for ſo often changing my miniſtry; and becauſe I lock up my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to prevent her eloping with the paltry clerk of a pitiful trader, it is forſooth an invaſion of the Bill of Rights, and a mortal ſtab to the great Charter of Liberty.</p>

               <p>But indeed, my dear brother, you are got quite out of your depth: Woman, I tell you, is a microcoſm, and rightly to rule her requires as great talents, as to govern a ſtate.

               <p>What then? for that ineſtimable bleſſing ſhe is not beholden to you; nor can you, tho' a father, with reaſon, juſtice, or law, take it from her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Margaret, you forget where you are! This, child, is the town of Madrid; you are amongſt a ſage, ſteady people, who know and revere the natural rights of a parent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>Natural rights! Can a right to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize be founded in nature?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Look'ee, Margaret! you are but loſing your time; for unleſs you can prevail on Count Wall, or the preſident of Caſtille, to grant you a Habeas, why Harriet ſhall ſtay where ſhe is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay, you know where you are; but,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0291600200:10"/>
if my niece will take my advice, the juſtice that is denied to her here, ſhe will inſtantly ſeek for elſewhere.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Elſewhere? hark you, ſiſter! is it thus you anſwer my purpoſe in bringing you hither? I hop'd to have my daughter's principles form'd by your prudence; her conduct directed by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and wiſdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>The preliminary is categorically true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Then why don't you abide by the treaty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; you have given me powerful motives!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>But another word, madam! as I don't chuſe that Harriet ſhould imbibe any more of your romantic republican notions, I ſhall take it as a great favour if you would prepare to quit this country with the firſt opportunity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>You need not have remonſtrated; a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have anſwered your purpoſe: I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to withdraw, and without taking leave; nor will I reſide on a ſpot where the great charter of my ſex is hourly invaded! No, Sir Thomas, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the land of liberty! but there expect to have your deſpotic dealings properly and publickly handled.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>There's no occaſion for that; liberty has already a champion in one of my ſex: The ſame

the ſupporter of <hi>alibi's,</hi> the ſource of ſham pleas, the maker and finder of flaws, the patron of perjury, and a ſworn foe to all trials by jury! Not long ago, though, my gentleman was put to his ſhifts.</p>

               <p>The law had laid hold of an old friend of his, for being too poſitive as to a matter of fact; evidence, evaſion, protraction, pleas, every art, was employed to acquit him, that the moſt conſummate ſkill could ſuggeſt; but all to no purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Not at all. Why, Sir, when matters grew deſperate, and the caſe was given over for loſt, little Belzy ſtarts up in the form of an able practitioner, and humbly conceived, that his client could not be convicted upon that indictment; foraſmuch as therein he was charg'd with forſwearing himſelf NOW; whereas it clearly appeared, by the evidence, that he had only forſworn himſelf THEN: If, indeed, he had been indicted generally, for committing perjury <hi>now</hi> AND <hi>then,</hi> proofs might be produced of any perjury he may have committed; whereas, by limiting the point of time to the <hi>now,</hi> no proofs could be admitted as to the <hi>then</hi>: So that, with ſubmiſſion, he humbly conceived, his client was clearly abſolved, and his character as fair and as ſpotleſs as a babe that's juſt born, and immaculate as a ſheet of white paper.</p>

dunces, nurſes, and apothecaries: But you have now a lucky opportunity of knowing more in an hour of the great improvements in this branch of civil ſociety, than, by any other means, ſeven years could have taught you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>The ſpirit of Diſcord prevails: The republic of tied periwigs, like the Romans of old, have turned their arms from the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to draw their ſhort ſwords on themſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>But how came this about?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>To carry on the metaphor, you muſt know, in this great town, there are two corps of theſe troops, equally numerous, and equally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable: The firſt, it is true, are diſciplined, and fight under a general, whom they chriſten a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident: The ſecond contains the huſſars, and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of phyſick; they rarely attack a patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; not but the latter ſingle-handed can do good execution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>But their cauſe of contention?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>Pride. The light troops are jealous of ſome honours the others poſſeſs by preſcription, and, though but a militia, think they have right to an equal rank with the regulars.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>Why, this in time may ruin their ſtate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>True; but that we muſt prevent; it is our intereſt to make up this breach: Already we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0291600200:33"/>
feel the fatal effects of their feuds: By neglecting their patients, the weekly bills daily decline, and new ſubjects begin to grow ſcarce in our realms.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>This does, indeed, claim your attention.</p>

               <p>We purpoſe to call in the aid of the law; bleeding the purſe is as effectual for damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirit, as opening a vein for lowering the pulſe: The Daemon of Litigation has already poſſeſſed the Licentiates; I muſt infuſe the ſame paſſion into the Preſident; and I warrant you, in two or three terms, with two or three trials, all ſides will be heartily tired. But, a-propos! I ſee a brace of apothecaries coming this way; they ſeem deep in debate: Let us liſten; we ſhall beſt learn from them the preſent poſture of—Huſh, hide!—You ſhall here too have a proof what a Proteus I am. <stage>They retire.</stage>

               <p>I tell you, Apozem, you are but young in the buſineſs, and don't foreſee how much we ſhall be all hurt in the end.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but what can be done, Mr. Julep? Here Dr. Hellebore writes me word, that they threaten a ſiege, and are provided with fire-arms: Would you have them ſurrender the College at once?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Fire-arms? If they are mad enough not

to know that the pen is the doctor's beſt piſtol, why, let them proceed!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>But are we to ſtand quietly by, and ſee the very ſeat of the ſcience demoliſhed and torn?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>And with what arms are we to defend it? where are our cannon? We have mortars indeed, but then they are fit to hold nothing but peſtles; and, as to our ſmall arms, of what uſe can they be in a ſiege? they are made, you know, to attack only the rear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, Mr. Julep, you make too light of theſe matters: To have the lawful deſcendants from Galen, the throne of Eſculapius, overturned by a parcel of Goths!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Peace, Apozem, or treat your betters with proper reſpect! What, numſkull, do you think all phyſicians are blockheads, who have not waſhed their hands in the Cam or the Iſis?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but I hope you will allow that a univerſity-doctor—</p>

               <p>May, for aught you know, be a dunce. Beſides, fool, what have we to do with degrees? The doctor that doſes beſt is the beſt doctor for us. You talk of the College; there are ſome of their names, I am ſure, that I never deſire to ſee on my file.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed!</p>

               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed? no, indeed. Why, there's Dr. Diet, that makes ſuch a duſt: He had a perſon of faſhion, a patient of mine, under his care t'other day; as fine a ſlow fever! I was in hopes of half making my fortune—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; I love a ſlow fever. Was it nervous?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ay; with a lovely dejection of ſpirits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>That was delightful, indeed! I look upon the nerves and the bile to be the two beſt friends we have to our back.—Well, pray, and how did it anſwer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all; the ſcoundrel let him ſlip through my hands for a ſong; only a paltry ſix pounds and a crown.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Shameful!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Infamous! and yet, forſooth, he was one of your College. Well, now to ſhew you the difference in men; but the very week after, Dr. Linctus, from Leyden, run me up a bill of thirty odd pounds, for only attending Alderman Soakpot ſix days in a ſurfeit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, that was doing of buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ah! that's a ſweet pretty practitioner, Apozem: We muſt all do our utmoſt to puſh him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt. But, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that you ſay, Mr. Julep, there are ſome of the gentlemen of the College, that I know—</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ah! as fine fellows as ever fingered a pulſe; not one of the trade will deny it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>But, amongſt all now, old Nat Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade is the man for my money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; Nat, Nat has merit, I own; but, pox take him! he is ſo deviliſh quick: To be ſure, he has a very pretty fluent pen whilſt it laſts; but then he makes ſuch diſpatch, that one has hardly time to ſend in two dozen of draughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; the doctor drives on, to be ſure.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Drives on! If I am at all free in the houſe when old Nightſhade is ſent for, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory doſe I always recommend an attorney.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>An attorney? for what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>To make the patient's will, before he ſwallows the doctor's preſcription.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>That is prudent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; I generally afterwards get the thanks of the family.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>What, Mr. Julep, for the attorney, or the phyſician? ha, ha!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ha, ha! you are arch, little Apozem; quite a wag, I profeſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you know, brother Julep, theſe are ſubjects upon which one can hardly be ſerious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>True, true; but then you ſhould never laugh loud in the ſtreet: We may indulge, indeed, a kind of ſimpering ſmile to our patients, as we
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0291600200:37"/>
drive by in our chariots; but then there is a decency, not to ſay dignity, that becomes the publick deméanour of us, who belong to the faculty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>True. And yet there are times when one can hardly forbear: Why, t'other day now I had like to have burſt: I was following a fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral into St. George's—a ſweet pretty burying; velvet pall, hatband and gloves; and, indeed, the widow was quite handſome in all things; paid my bill the next week, without ſconcing off ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, though they were thought to have lived hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily together—but, as I was a-ſaying, as we were entering the church, who ſhould ſtand in the porch but Kit Cabbage the taylor, with a new pair of breeches under his arm: The ſly rogue made me a bow, <q rend="inline">"Servant, maſter Apozem!" ſays he; "what, you are carrying home your work too, I ſee."</q> Did you ever hear ſuch a dog?</p>

               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay; let them, let them—But, is not that Dr. Squib that is croſſing the way?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; you may ſee it is Squib, by his ſhuffle. What, I ſuppoſe now he is ſcouring away for the College.</p>

               <p>No? Lord help you! he is too much taken up with the national illneſs, to attend to particular ails: Why, he would quit the beſt patient in town, to hunt after a political ſecret; and would rather have a whiſper from a great man in the Court of Requeſts, than five hundred pounds for attending him in a chronical caſe.</p>

               <p>Why, I don't know, maſter; the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were frightful, and would not conſent; otherwiſe, by this time, 'tis my belief, men, women, and children, I might have occupied twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at leaſt.</p>

               <p>Why, it is all along with one Lotion, a pottercarrier, that lives in a little town hard by we; he is grown old and laſcivious, I think, and threatens to preſent me at ſize, if ſo be I practize any longer.</p>

But my maſter Tyth'em tells me, that I can get it done for pretty near the ſame price here in London; ſo, I had rather, d'ye ſee, lay out my money at home, than tranſport it to foreign parts, as we ſay; becauſe why, maſter, I thinks there has too much already gone that road.</p>

               <p>Oſaſafras? that's a name of no note; he is not a Mileſian, I am ſure.

               <p>Simony, Sir, is a new kind of canon, deviſed by theſe upſtart fanatics, that makes it ſinful not to abuſe the confidence, and piouſly plunder the little property, of an indigent man and his family.</p>

               <p>So they were formerly; but now they are directed by the Genius of Inſipidity: He has entered into partnerſhip with the managers of both houſes, and they have ſet up a kind of circulating library, for the vending of dialogue novels. I dare not go near the new houſe, for the Daemon of Power, who gave me this lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, has poſſeſſed the pates, and ſown diſcord among the mock monarchs there; and what one receives, the other rejects. And as to the other houſe, the manager has great merit himſelf, with ſkill to diſcern, and candor to allow it in others; but I can be of no uſe in making your bargain, for in that he would be too many for the cunningeſt Devil amongſt us.</p>
