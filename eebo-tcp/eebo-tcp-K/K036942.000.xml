            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>IN antient times, when <hi>Britain</hi>'s trade was arms,</l>
               <l>And the lov'd muſick of her youth, alarms.</l>
               <l>A god-like race ſuſtain'd fair <hi>England</hi>'s fame:</l>
               <l>Who has not heard of gallant <hi>PIERCY</hi>'s name?</l>
               <l>Ay, and of <hi>DOUGLAS?</hi> Such illuſtrious foes</l>
               <l>In rival <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> never roſe!</l>
               <l>From age to age bright ſhone the <hi>Britiſh</hi> fire,</l>
               <l>And every hero was a hero's ſire.</l>
               <l>When powerful fate decreed one warrior's doom,</l>
               <l>Up ſprung the Phoenix from his parent's tomb.</l>
               <l>But whilſt theſe generous rivals fought and fell,</l>
               <l>Theſe generous rivals lov'd each other well:</l>
               <l>Tho' many a bloody field was loſt and won,</l>
               <l>Nothing in hate, in honour all was done.</l>
               <l>When <hi>PIERCY</hi> wrong'd defy'd his prince or peers,</l>
               <l>Faſt came the <hi>DOUGLAS,</hi> with his <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ſpears;</l>
               <l>And, when proud <hi>DOUGLAS</hi> made his King his foe,</l>
               <l>For <hi>DOUGLAS, PIERCY</hi> bent his <hi>Engliſh</hi> bow.</l>
               <l>Expell'd their native homes by adverſe fate,</l>
               <l>They knock'd alternate at each other's gate:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0814501800:3"/>Then blaz'd the caſtle, at the midnight hour,</l>

               <l>This night a <hi>DOUGLAS</hi> your protection claims;</l>
               <l>A wife! a mother! pity's ſofteſt names:</l>
               <l>The ſtory of her woes indulgent hear,</l>

                     <l>Sent down to ſearch the ſecret ſins of men.</l>
                     <l>Some eighteen years ago, I rented land</l>
                     <l>Of brave Sir MALCOLM, then BALARMO's lord;</l>
                     <l>But falling to decay, his ſervants ſeiz'd</l>
                     <l>All that I had, and then turn'd me and mine,</l>

                     <l>Out to the mercy of the winter winds.</l>
                     <l>A little hovel by the river's ſide</l>
                     <l>Receiv'd us: there hard labour, and the ſkill</l>
                     <l>In fiſhing, which was formerly my ſport,</l>
                     <l>Supported life. Whilſt thus we poorly liv'd,</l>
                     <l>One ſtormy night, as I remember well,</l>
                     <l>The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof:</l>
                     <l>Red came the river down, and loud and oft</l>
                     <l>The angry ſpirit of the water ſhrick'd.</l>
                     <l>At the dead hour of night was heard the cry</l>
                     <l>Of one in jeopardy. I roſe, and ran</l>
                     <l>To where the circling eddy of a pool</l>
                     <l>Beneath the ford, us'd oft to bring within</l>
                     <l>My reach whatever floating thing the ſtream</l>
                     <l>Had caught. The voice was ceas'd; the perſon loſt:</l>

                     <l>Down on the deep: then lifting up her head</l>
                     <l>And her white hands to heaven, ſeeming to ſay,</l>
                     <l>Why am I forc'd to this? She plung'd herſelf</l>
                     <l>Into the empty air.</l>

               <l>AN Epilogue I aſk'd; but not one word</l>
               <l>Our bard will write. He vows 'tis moſt abſurd</l>
               <l>With comick wit to contradict the ſtrain</l>
               <l>Of tragedy, and make your ſorrows vain.</l>
               <l>Sadly he ſays, that pity is the beſt,</l>
               <l>And nobleſt paſſion of the human breaſt:</l>
               <l>For when its ſacred ſtreams the heart o'er-flow,</l>
               <l>In guſhes pleaſure with the tide of woe;</l>
               <l>And when its waves retire, like thoſe of <hi>Nile,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They leave behind them ſuch a golden ſoil,</l>
               <l>That there the virtues without culture grow,</l>
               <l>There the ſweet bloſſoms of affection blow.</l>
               <l>Theſe were his words; void of deluſive art</l>
               <l>I felt them; for he ſpoke them from his heart.</l>
               <l>Nor will I now attempt, with witty folly,</l>
               <l>To chace away celeſtial melancholy.</l>
