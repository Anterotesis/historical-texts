            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>INquiries into antiquity are ſo little the taſte of the preſent age, that a writer who employs his time in that way deceives himſelf if he expects to derive either much reputation or any advantage from his work. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt the ſubject, we add contempt to its natural ſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſeem to wiſh for no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from a province which we have been taught to aſſign to fiction and romance. Under theſe impreſſions the Author of the Introduction wrote. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the ordinary incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to literary labour, he was induced to proceed by the ſole motive of private amuſement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0156700600:3"/>
Notwithſtanding the ſmall hopes he entertains of reconciling the public judgment to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which he has endeavoured to illuſtrate, he has taken ſome pains to preſent, in its moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable form, a ſubject not very capable of ornament. He has ſtudied to be clear in diſquiſition, conciſe in obſervation, juſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. An enemy to fiction himſelf, he impoſes none upon the world. He advances nothing as fact without authorities; and his conjectures ariſe not ſo much from his own ingenuity, as from the proofs which the ancients have laid down before him.</p>
            <p>The darkneſs, with which the prejudice and vanity of the Scots and Iriſh have covered their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, has forced the Author to examine that point with a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs, which a diſpute ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>important
<pb facs="tcp:0156700600:4"/>
ſeems not to deſerve. But the diſquiſitions of many learned men had given a kind of conſequence to the ſubject, when they rendered it perplexed and obſcure. To extricate truth from the polemical rubbiſh of former antiquaries was a taſk of labour; and the candid will forgive the length, on account of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, of the diſquiſition, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a work which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly treats of the antiquities of the Britiſh nations.</p>
            <p>In that part of his work which relates to the diſputes between the Britiſh and Iriſh Scots, the Author of the Introduction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives much of his information from the manuſcript notes of the late very ingenious Dr. Macpher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe diſſertations on the antiquities of the northern Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain are in the hands of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the other provinces of
<pb facs="tcp:0156700600:5"/>
his ſubject, he has availed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the induſtry of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern writers; but he neither bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows their ſentiments, nor relies upon their judgment. He looks upon antiquity through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the ancients, and thinks he ſees it in its genuine ſtate. His work is formed on the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſult of the information which the writers of Greece and Rome have tranſmitted from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and if his ſyſtem is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, it, at leaſt, is new.</p>

thought every purſuit not immediately ſubſervient to the profeſſion of arms mean and diſhonourable.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0156700600:80"/>
Latin, and Iriſh alphabets, together with the Ogum of Ireland, little more than a century after the univerſal deluge. A legend which ſays that the Greek al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet was invented many ages before Cecrops and Cadmus, and the Latin characters ſeventeen centuries before the Romans were a people, is too ridiculous to deſerve any ſerious conſideration. But this idle ſtory is not more pregnant with abſurdity than the mention that is made of Adam, Cain, Noah, the deluge, Moſes, Pharaoh, and many other names and tranſactions in the old teſtament, in annals ſaid to have been written many ages before Chriſtianity introduced into Europe any knowledge of the Jewiſh hiſtory and antiquities.</p>

Should this early ſettlement be once aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, it naturally ought to follow that the Britiſh Scots derived their blood from thoſe of Ireland; if they did, they muſt have carried with them to Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia that learning, ſcience, and civility, which had made ſo great a progreſs in their mother-country before they tranſmigrated from it. But nothing is more certain than that the Britiſh Scots were an illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate people, and involved in barbariſm, even after St. Patrick's miſſion to the Scots of Ireland.

It is difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend why a mixture of foreign blood ſhould be neceſſary to make the Iriſh a warlike people. If the ſituation of their country ſecured them from invaſion, the civil diſſentions ariſing from their being divided into a number of petty ſepts would have undoubtedly kindled and preſerved a martial ſpirit among them. But if a

If this is an argument, others of the ſame kind and of equal force may be produced to oppoſe it.

This has been the laſt reſort, the unanſwerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which all the Iriſh antiquaries have referred the certainty of the Spaniſh extraction of their nation. Unfortunately for the old Hibernian ſyſtem, a dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the Biſcayan language is, at this moment, in the poſſeſſion of the Author of the Introduction, and he publickly declares that there is leſs affinity between the Biſcayan and Iriſh languages, than between the latter and the tongue of the moſt diſtant nations in the eaſtern Aſia.

This diſcovery ſeems to confirm the opinion of Varro, who, as he is cited by Pliny, inſinuates that the Iberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Spain were of African origin. The language of the modern Biſcayans, it is certain, bears no affinity to the other European tongues, which are radically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the ancient Celtic. The name of Iberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans given to them in contradiſtinction to the Celtae is a proof of their being a different people. Lucan ſeems to inſinuate this fact in a line already quoted; Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Celtae <hi>miſcentes</hi> nomen Iberis; and the Venere Celtae <hi>ſociati</hi> nomen Iberis of Silius Italicus, together with the expreſs teſtimony of Diodorus Siculus and Appian, confirms the opinion.</note>.</p>

Both countries were peopled many ages before the reign of Domitian, but how they were governed, or by what petty chieftains or kings, a Scottiſh or Iriſh Beroſus can only tell. Had a hundred Hibernian colonies, with a royal Mileſian at the head of each, tranſmigrated into North Britain, before the Roman arms penetrated into Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, they muſt, without a revelation from heaven, remain involved in eternal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.

It is as ridiculous to aſſert, as it would be downright anility to believe, that Caledonia received an Iriſh colony before Tacitus wrote the life of Agricola. To prove that no Iriſh colony tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into Britain in or after the reign of Domitian, it is proper to review what the Romans have communicated concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of Caledonia from that period to the appearance of the Scots on the frontiers of the province.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Bede is the firſt writer who poſitively affirms that the Scots of Britain derived their origin from thoſe of Ireland. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they originally obtained from the Picts the principality of Iar-gaël or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle by force or treaty, was a point which all his hiſtorical and traditional knowledge did not enable the venerable Anglo-Saxon to determine. The incapacity of Bede, who lived ſo near the pretended tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of the Iriſh, to ſolve this difficulty, is a kind of demonſtration that the whole ſtory is a fiction, impoſed upon that credulous, though pious writer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Second argument.</note> If the Picts were ſo ſeeble that a band of Iriſh adventurers could tear from them one third of their dominions, how came they ſo frequently to provoke the Roman legions, and haraſs the provincials from the time of Chlorus to the total dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of Britain by Honorius? To invade the territories of a warlike and diſciplined people when they ſuffered a great part of their own to be wreſted from them by a deſpicable enemy, is a folly too abſurd to gain any credit. But perhaps the Picts
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0156700600:119"/>
gave the diſtrict of Argyle to their allies of Ireland, in conſideration of ſervices againſt the Romans. Theſe ſervices were extremely unneceſſary; for the Romans, till provoked by incurſions, were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive towards the Barbarians beyond the walls. Nations, in ſhort, have been known to receive foreigners into the boſom of their country to repel invaſions, but it is ridiculous to think that any people would have recourſe to ſo dangerous an expedient for the pleaſure of harraſſing neighbours who did not in any degree offend them.</p>

to aſſiſt the exiles in recovering their territories; and, by that means, to endeavour to conquer a part of a fine country for themſelves. But the Picts were, it ſeems, ſtrangers to the moſt common maxims of policy; for, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſyſtem under conſideration, they muſt have been of all nations the moſt tame, prodigal, and imprudent.

In the period of time between the expedition of Julius Agricola and the reign of Conſtantius we have already ſeen, that the improbability of the tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a foreign colony into North Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is ſo great that, without poſitive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the ſtory can never be believed.

               <p>The impoſſibility of an Iriſh migration into North Britain between the reign of Conſtantius and the dereliction of Britain by Honorius, is ſupported by arguments equally ſtrong with thoſe we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the period before the firſt of thoſe emperors. Thoſe who after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius ſucceeded to the imperial purple, till the days of Valentinian, were rather inſulted than feared by the wild nations of Caledonia.

To obviate all ſcepticiſm concerning a ſtory which wore the face of improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it became neceſſary for ſucceeding writers to give aſſurances to the world, that letters and polite arts were cultivated in Ireland no leſs than ſeventeen hundred years before its converſion to the chriſtian faith by St. Patrick.</p>

Tacitus has not mentioned any national names in North Britain but thoſe of Caledonii and Horeſtii; yet it is certain that the Vecturiones and Deucaledones of Marcellinus, the Maeatae of Dion Caſſius, the Gadeni, Cantae, and Epidii of Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy, poſſeſſed that country.

But, if he has neglected to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Scots of Britain, he has been equally unjuſt to thoſe of Ireland; a circumſtance very ſtrange, if that country was, as Bede ſays, overſtocked with tribes of that name before Caledonia received any colony from abroad.</p>

The Franks and Allemans were not heard of before the third century; yet thoſe nations, in whom the Catti, Chauci, Cheruſci, Agravarii, the Teutones, and the Cimbri, in a confined ſenſe, were loſt, were never once thought to have been a new people, who had enſlaved, deſtroyed, or expelled, the old inhabitants of thoſe territories which they poſſeſſed in Germany.

The illiterate, and conſequently the bulk of the Iriſh nation, were never reconciled to this innovation.

Early on the firſt day of May ſome ſelect perſons met in a private place, and, by turning with great rapidity an augre in a dry piece of wood, extracted what they called the <hi>forced</hi> or <hi>elementary</hi> fire<note n="*" place="bottom">TEIN-EGIN, or the forced fire. The practice of extracting the TEIN-EGIN is not yet altogether diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among the ignorant vulgar.</note>. Some active young men, one from each hamlet in the diſtrict, attended at a diſtance, and, as ſoon as the <hi>forced fire</hi> was kindled, carried part of it with great expedition and joy to their reſpective villages. The people immediately aſſembled upon ſome rock or eminencee, lighted the BEL-TEIN, and ſpent the day in mirth and feſtivity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">the Beltien.</note> The ceremonies uſed upon this occaſion were founded upon opinions of which there is now no trace remaining in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. It is in vain to inquire why thoſe ignorant perſons, who are addicted to this ſuperſtition, throw into the BEL-TEIN a portion of thoſe things upon which they regale themſelves on the firſt of May. Neither is there any reaſon aſſigned by

them for decking branches of mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Clou-äan BEL-TEIN, i. e. the ſplit branch of the fire on the rock. Thoſe who have ingraſted Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on many of the ſuperſtitions of their remoteſt anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have now converted the Clou-än BEL-TEIN into a croſs.</note> with wreaths of flowers and heath, which they carry, with ſhouts and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of joy, in proceſſion three times round the fire. Theſe branches they afterwards depoſite above the doors of their reſpective dwellings, where they remain till they give place to others in the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other extraordinary and ſuperſtitious ceremonies, uſed upon this occaſion, have, it is certain, much of the appearance of religious worſhip paid by the ancient Caledonians to the Sun. The rude monuments which, as we have already obſerved, bear ſtill the name of GRIAN-AIS, ſeem, at firſt ſight, to put the certainty of the exiſtence of polytheiſm among the Celtae beyond any diſpute; but we may venture to affirm, that neither of thoſe circumſtances furniſhes a concluſive argument upon that head.</p>

The element of fire, and above all, the Sun, which is the ſource of it, were objects in which the ſoul of the world ſeemed moſt manifeſtly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert itſelf; and conſequently they, more than any other part of nature, employed the attention of a ſuperſtitious people: and this attention ſoon degenerated into thoſe ridiculous ceremonies which we have juſt deſcribed.

Had the obſervation been juſt, the preſent Engliſh ſhould exceed their fathers in ſtature; but this is ſo far from being the caſe, that they fall ſhort of the modern Germans, and are ſcarce ſuperior, in that reſpect, to the French, who, from poſſeſſing the grape, have for ages diſcontinued the drinking of beer. To ſtrengthen the argument it may be here obſerved, that the inhabitants of London, who uſe beer the moſt, are of a ſmaller ſize than thoſe who live leſs luxuriouſly in other parts of the kingdom. To ſolve the difficulty we muſt have recourſe to a remark already made; that the Sarmatae, who, upon the decline of the Romans, advanced into the regions of the Weſt, were a very different race of men from the Celtae, and that they ſent down their low ſize, with their blood, to the preſent inhabitants of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, who are, in a great meaſure, their poſterity<note n="*" place="bottom">The general uſe of ſpirits, which has much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed of late in Europe, may have contributed to leſſen the ſize of the preſent race.

This conſideration has induced the Author of the introduction to confine, within nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds, his obſervations on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the ancient Britiſh nations; for where the road lies through a barren coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the journey ought to be ſhort.</p>

               <head>Reflections on the Origin of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Riſe and progreſs of ſociety.</note> SOCIETY is of greater antiquity than government. Civil regulations confeſs, in their own origin, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of public crimes. Mankind, like other animals, herded originally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through mere inſtinct; and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves who think that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were formed under a preconcerted ſyſtem of policy. Man, in his rudeſt ſtate, being deſtitute of property, neither fears nor meets with injuſtice: He poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes nothing which his own arm cannot defend, before the love of the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of life has overcome his neighbour's natural propenſity to juſtice. In the progreſs of ſociety individuals poliſh one another, as it were, by colliſion. The fruit of the ingenuity of one is adopted and improved by another: New inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtart up in every quarter, and are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0156700600:253"/>
loſt in none: Luxury grows with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the arts of civil life, rapacity treads cloſe on its heels; and then, for the firſt time, the check of law and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation becomes neceſſary to the welfare, if not to the very being of the community.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Origin of monarchy.</note> The popular form of government is more ancient than monarchy. The patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal authority from which ſome writers deduce the latter, is too much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in degree and time to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from which monarchy flows. The power which a parent has over his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot be tranſmitted to his ſon. He derives it from nature. and it dies with himſelf. Regal government is a civil inſtitution, which in various coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries owes its commencement to various cauſes. It generally takes its riſe from a kind of uſurpation; and, whatever theoriſts in politics may ſay, there were originally no ſtipulations made between the tyrant and the people. Length of time eſtabliſhes into a kind of right what, at the beginning, was an act of injuſtice; and the acquieſcence of the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes into a moral duty that obedience which was at firſt the effect of fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment older than monarchy.</note> The ſimplicity of monarchical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has eſtabliſhed with many an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of its ſuperior antiquity. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of ſociety, like that of man, muſt be awed, ſay they, into good behaviour by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0156700600:254"/>
the fear of obvious puniſhment. The ſlow movements of popular governments command no reſpect, and impreſs no fears; and therefore men naturally place the power of the ſtate where it can be exerted with moſt expedition and preciſion. They who argue in this manner are little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the character of barbarous times. In the firſt ſtage of ſociety there is no inequality between individuals: a man's mind muſt be opened with civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation before he will acquieſce in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his own inferiority. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian knows no perſon better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he ſubmits to the dictates of none; deriving, in fact, from the vigour and independence of his own mind, that liberty which we owe to an accidental conſtitution of government.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Monarchy begins in force, and is ſupported by influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> Though monarchy, for the moſt part, begins in the midſt of tumult and war, the very exiſtence of regal power preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a conſiderable degree of civility in the community. The authority which the leader of a nation may acquire from perſonal merit in battle will die away in peace, unleſs the machine is kept in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the continued impulſe of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and this influence, which is the foundation, if not the origin, of kingly government, is only to be obtained by having ſomething to beſtow upon abettors and dependents. A few being gained.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0156700600:255"/>
through the channel of intereſt, the many are over-awed into ſubmiſſion; and that lenity and impartial juſtice, which pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence dictates in the firſt periods of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, contributes to reconcile the minds of the people to the government of one.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Origin and nature of the popular form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> In the early infancy of a ſtate, the only laws that ſubſiſt in the community are the opinions and prejudices of the people. Before property is well eſtabliſhed, the catalogue of crimes is very ſuccinct; and the puniſhments annexed to each are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſevere nor inflicted with preciſion. The people have not yet delegated their authority to a few; and the power that remains in the hands of the many ſeldom exerts itſelf with vigour. The ſociety is kept together more by habit, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of vice, than by any thing which deſerves the name of government. The people, who have the whole power in their hands, convene only when they are to carry war into an enemy's country, or to defend their own. They conſult together but on the external affairs of the community; its internal concerns are left to the opinions of individuals. This ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all regulation may be called the moſt ancient form of government; and it may be diſtinguiſhed by the title of a popular government, as the opinions of the people in general are the only checks upon the crimes and irregularities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals.</p>

The illuſtrious nation had too much ſenſe to endeavour to impoſe their own language upon the conquered; and, had they even departed from their uſual political prudence on that head, it is ſcarcely credible, that they could have ſucceeded in the attempt.

The nations who inhabited thoſe exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive regions originally, and whoſe poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſtill, in a great degree, poſſeſs them, were, in fact, the ſame people with the Romans. Thoſe Gaël, who in Italy went under the name of Umbri, were partly the anceſtors of the Banditti who ſettled with Romulus on the banks of the Tiber. The Romans, in their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to commerce, vindicate, in part, their Celtic origin againſt their pretended deſcent from the Greeks of Magna Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, who were in ſome meaſure a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial people. Some of their own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters join iſſue with us in this opinion. Their language, though tinctured with Helleniſms, is radically different from the Greek; and we ſhall, in a ſubſequent ſection, have occaſion to ſhew, that the primitives of the Latin tongue differ not materially from the language of a branch of the Celtae, to whom neither the litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor the government of Rome ever extended themſelves.</p>

To remove every ground of ſuppoſition that the Scots of either of the Britiſh Iſles borrowed any part of their language from the Latin it is neceſſary to obſerve, that almoſt every one word in the Gaëlic column is either a compound or derivative from ſome well known primitive in that language. The Gaëlic primitives are all monoſyllables. Wherever a word of more ſyllables than one preſents itſelf it is a compound; and all the adjectives are formed, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſome termination or other, to a ſubſtantive noun.</p>

The ingenious Mr. Lhud's comparative vocabulary is already in the hands of the curious; and to ſuch as are not fond of philological diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition it is ſufficient to obſerve, that the three languages, though not recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally underſtood by the Scots, Welch, and the inhabitants of Britanny, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſcended from that tongue which

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of the ſtability of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire,</note> The Romans differed not more from other nations in the riſe and progreſs, than in the extent and permanence of their power. The fall of the republic, by melting down into one maſs all diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of party, gave ſtability and weight to the ſtate, when it deſtroyed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the members of which it was compoſed. Feeble and corrupted in the center, the empire threw all its vigour and ſtrength into its frontier, and became formidable abroad in the midſt of domeſtic decay. The diſputes about the purple, though frequent and bloody, were but partial ſhocks; they agitated and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but did neither break nor ruin the great fabric of the ſtate. The ſtorms were violent, but they did not laſt long;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0156700600:286"/>
and things were ſoon reſtored to their original balance by the tranquility of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute government.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.</note> The deſpotic empires of Aſia raiſed by the abilities of one prince fall through the weakneſs of another: the fate of the ſtate is involved with the life of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and when he dies in battle, or by the hands of the aſſaſſin, the great body, of which he was the head, ſubmits to a foreign conqueror, or ſeparates into petty principalities under domeſtic tyrants. The imperial authority at Rome ſtood upon a more ſolid foundation. When the Julian family reduced the Roman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public into an empire for themſelves, they did not change in appearance the ancient form of government. Though a new power ſtarted up in the ſtate, all the old offices remained. Deſpotiſm had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to cover oppreſſion with a maſk, and to execute its moſt rigorous plans through channels neither unknown nor formidable in the days of freedom. The power of the firſt Caeſars conſiſted in influence; and an overawed and venal ſenate were the obvious inſtruments of their tyranny.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why the permanency of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</note> The interference of the imperial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was confined to matters of ſtate. The detail of inferior government, the courſe of juſtice between individuals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the poſſeſſion of ancient forms. The oppreſſions of the worſt of the Caeſars

ſcarce ever extended beyond the walls of Rome; and the provinces which had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed under the exactions of republican praefects flouriſhed under the lieutenants of a Caligula and a Nero. Though, veſted with the ſacredneſs of his tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian authority, no laws could bind the emperor, the empire itſelf was governed, in fact, by a regular ſyſtem of laws; and therefore, when the tyrant fell, the ſtate was not involved in his ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the fate of the prince.</note> There was one other cauſe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the permanence of the Empire from depending on the fate of the prince. The hereditary ſucceſſion, which the Julian family endeavoured to eſtabliſh, expired with Nero; and the ſuffrage of the army, confirmed by the approbation of a timid and complying ſenate, became the only neceſſary title to the throne. Men raiſed by accidental influence to the imperial dignity, though they inforced obedience, could command neither reſpect nor attachment from a people among whom they themſelves had been ſo lately numbered as private perſons. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who are, in every age and nation, the great ſupporters of hereditary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, found no reſting-place for their loyalty in the fluctuations of imperial ſucceſſion; and they acquieſced, without reluctance, in the government of any ambitious leader, who had paved his way

The firſt Antonine, by extending the freedom of the city to<note n="*" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius ſays, that this was the act of Ant. Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calla, but other writers of credit affirm the contrary. It was only, perhaps, the freedom of Latium that was extended to the provinces by Antoninus Pius; that of the city by Caracalla.</note> all the provinces, broke down the fence of diſtinction which, even in the midſt of degeneracy, protected ſome ſmall remains of the old Roman ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. When the excluſive privilege of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens was no longer confined to Italy, the awe which the conquered nations had for the original ſeat of greatneſs gradually decayed. When, to be born within the walls of Rome no longer conferred any peculiar immunities, that myſterious tie, which bound the attachment of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen himſelf to the reſidence of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, was broken; and the veneration once annexed to the Roman name became naturally feeble, when the name itſelf was diffuſed over half the world.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0156700600:289"/>
ſpirit in the provinces balanced, for ſome time, its decline in Italy. The debility which tyranny and luxury carried from Rome through all its dominions, even contributed, though the opinion is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to the permanency and ſtability of the empire. The conquered nations, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of their arms, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe enervating arts, which, by adminiſtering to luxury, deprave when they poliſh the human mind. Timid and habituated to ſubmiſſion, they fell in love with the tranquillity of deſpotiſm; and in a kind of determination to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſlaves, they became indifferent about the title and virtues of their tyrant. The news of his acceſſion was enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the authority of any prince in the moſt diſtant regions of the empire; and many provinces were ſo diſpirited and paſſive, that a military force was found altogether unneceſſary to ſecure their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. No attempt at independence could be made by ſuch an inactive body. Men were either ignorant of the natural rights of their ſpecies, or meanly reſigned them for the abject ſecurity of ſervitude.</p>

was a ſtranger to thoſe enervating vices which extinguiſh the martial ſpirit. When the legions followed an ambitious leader to Rome, a diſmiſſion from ſervice was the common reward of their fidelity; and if they were depraved by licence, they were ſoon diſſipated and loſt in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral imbecillity of the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They were ſucceeded in the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial provinces by new levies of hardy and uncorrupted barbarians, who preſerved an appearance of vigour in the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the empire, after the center had exhibited every ſymptom of political de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> The impolitic vanity of Conſtantine, in removing the ſeat of empire to a new capital, gave a mortal blow to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtate. The ſenate, whoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and authority had declined with their virtue, were, in ſome meaſure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated by being tranſplanted to another place. The name, even the very walls of Rome, contained ſomething within them which commanded obedience from the provinces. The opinion which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports all government was deſtroyed, by turning the attention of the people to a quarter to which they were not accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to look. They were habituated to obey implicitly the mandates of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man emperors and Roman ſenates; but to Bizantine princes and aſſemblies they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0156700600:291"/>
paid only that cold and unwilling obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which force extorts from ſlaves. To complete at once the ruin of that mighty fabric which the policy and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ancient Rome had raiſed, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, by creating new offices and by changing the names of many of the old, altered the conſtitution of the Roman government This prince, in ſhort, who covered with ſplendid exploits, in public life, the meanneſs and even wickedneſs of his private character, was more fatal to the permanancy of the Roman power, eſpecially in the Weſt, than the moſt wretched and impolitic of his predeceſſors in the imperial dignity.</p>

His untimely death extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laſt hopes of Rome. The vigour and prudence with which he conducted his meaſures in his early youth ſerve only to ſhew what he might have been in his riper years. Had he lived, there was a chance for the future permanency of the empire, a certainty of its temporary greatneſs. He fell, and the whole fabric of Roman power nodded to its fall when he died. The circumſcribed abilities of ſome of his ſucceſſors ſupported, for a few years, a part of the venerable ruin; but

The Barbarians of the North and Eaſt, who have even pervaded the regions of Aſia itſelf with their migrations, gave the finiſhing blow to a ſtate already tottering to its fall. Wandering like beaſts of prey on the ſkirts of their own deſerts, they ſaw the luxuries which prevailed within the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pale, and they made many attempts to break into the fold. Whilſt vigour and diſcipline remained among the legions on the frontiers, they repelled with eaſe the irregular incurſions of the naked Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of the North and Eaſt. But after the general effeminacy had extended itſelf to the army, enemies who, in the better days of Rome, were deſpiſed, became formidable and victorious. The fence being once broken down, the deluge ſoon

Deſtitute of means of conveying their own annals to poſterity, the firſt feeble light of hiſtory was thrown upon them when they ſhewed themſelves, in a hoſtile manner, on the frontiers of the empire. The writers who have ſent down the earlieſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their invaſions, aſtoniſhed at their appearance, and alarmed at their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, ſeem to have been more anxious to deſcribe what they then were, than what they had formerly been.

The Angli, in the days of Tacitus, worſhipped the Earth under the name of Hertha; and it was the ſame divinity who afterwards obtained the title of Frea, the ſpouſe of the great Odin. Men who deduce every ſyſtem of religion from rational principles, may reſt the origin of that of the Saxons on philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. Odin was the irreſiſtible princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which gives motion to every thing that breathes; and Hertha, Frea, or the Earth, furniſhed that portion of matter which is animated into living creatures, by the active and pervading ſpirit, which is diſtinguiſhed under the name of God.</p>
