            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>AS early as the year 1733, I read the following diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on <hi>Hermaphrodites,</hi> at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meeting of the Academy of Surgery. Though it ſeemed equally to take with the people of the art, and the learned of all denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who honoured the aſſembly with their preſence, I thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per however to defer the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: at that time being too young, and but juſt beginning to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the practice of hernia's, which requiring a great deal of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and a delicacy of manners, a work of this ſort could not fail of expoſing my character to the cenſure and malice of my enemies.
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0165100900:3"/>It was neceſſary therefore to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it; it now has lain by me for eighteen years, and would have lain ſtill longer, had it not been for ſome circumſtances which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with me to publiſh it.</p>
            <p>There appeared in <hi>London,</hi> ten years ago, a girl of bad ſtructure as to the parts of generation, who paſſed for an Hermaphrodite; ſhe in that reſpect impoſed upon the curious. Dr. <hi>Parſons</hi> publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh</hi> a book intituled, <hi>A mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and critical inquiry into the nature of Hermaphrodites.</hi> This work undeceived the world as to the falſe notion it had entertained in regard to this creature. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of perſon of the male kind, and lately arrived here, gives room to diſputes about his ſtate; ſome affirming, others denying, it to be hermaphrodital. People go ſtill farther, and aſk themſelves, Whether really there be genuine
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0165100900:4"/>Hermaphrodites or no? Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there may be, others would prove there are none. Thoſe build on the opinions of authors, who have proved their exiſtence; theſe employ the arguments, which other authors have oppoſed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. From all theſe reaſonings there appear to reſult but vague and confuſed ideas, which ſtill leave the problem unreſolved.</p>
            <p>My deſign is not to decide this controverſy, my only view is to expoſe the facts on each ſide, which have given room to the diſputes that have ſubſiſted for upwards of two thouſand years, upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I have confined myſelf, as much as poſſible, within the ſtricteſt limits; I thought that it was better to inſtruct by amuſing, than to tire out by inſtructing. In giving a ſummary relation of the opinions of authors, I afford ſatiſfaction enough to the learned; the curious will aſk
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0165100900:5"/>for no more. To ſupport the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ancients, I ſhall relate the moſt authentick obſervations of our days, made by modern practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners who are ſtill living: I have added the hiſtory of an anomolous perſon, whom I have myſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And here I ſhall obviate an objection, which the criticks will be ſure to ſtart upon this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; they will ſay, it is too long; a fault which ſome perſons have upbraided me with, in regard to my diſſertation on hernia's. To this I anſwer, that obſervations can never be too circumſtantial; and that it is a defect, common both to the ancients and moderns, to be too little circumſtantial in relating of facts: and this accounts for our deriving ſo little benefit from the numerous volumes of obſervations left us by the ancients. Why then do not the moderns, who expect to be read, correct the faults they
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0165100900:6"/>find in thoſe who have gone before them?</p>
            <p>To avoid the reproaches that might be made me in regard to the paſſages which I have been obliged to quote from the Latin poets, I have ſoftened, in the tranſlation, the freedom of the original, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering any thing in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of the authors.</p>
            <p>As to the plates, which might convey along with them, to the minds of ſome, a character of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenity, they are taken from the authors; and if there is any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it is only in the delicacy of the execution; a mark of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of the bookſeller, who has been at that expence.</p>
            <p>As my deſign is to enlarge this ſubject with the greateſt number of obſervations I can poſſibly collect, I take this occaſion to invite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0165100900:7"/>of the art acquainted with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar caſes, to communicate them, in order to their being put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a new edition of this work, which their generoſity would encourage. The authors will be no loſers, the publick great gainers; eſpecially if the obſervations are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with cuts.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are poſſeſſed of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular facts in relation to hernia's, are alſo entreated to communicate them, to be put in their proper places in the new edition of <hi>The compleat treatiſe of Hernia's,</hi> which I propoſe to publiſh in quarto next year.</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION ON HERMAPHRODITES.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Introduction.</note>WHATEVER degree of accuracy and wiſdom nature employs in the compoſition and frame of the human body, we have oftener than once ſeen her ſwerve from theſe, and, as it were, forget herſelf; oftener than once, inſtead of regarding that conſtruction, that order, thoſe proportions of the organs, whence reſults that perfect harmony, which forms the object of our admiration, ſhe has exhibited irregular, vicious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly conformations of parts. It ſhould ſeem, to ſpeak the language of a certain author, that this common parent, tired out and ſpent with producing every day the ſame things, over and over, in the ſame order, did now and then quit that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0165100900:9"/>uniformity, and throw into her producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a variety but little conformable to her laws. Sometimes ſhe with-holds from a body the parts the moſt neceſſary; in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject, ſhe is pleaſed to multiply them, often allots them ſituations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, and dimenſions, the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and fantaſtical; ſhe ſeparates what, according to her own laws, ſhould be joined, and joins what ought to remain ſeparate: hence ariſe thoſe deformities in the ſtrokes or features, thoſe members ill-articulated, thoſe diſproportions, thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of organical parts, and thoſe combinations, ſo monſtrous and out of the common road, that it is with difficulty we diſcover nature even in nature herſelf. Among the <hi>luſus naturae,</hi> which are exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to us under different forms, ſome are of a peculiar ſpecies, which cannot fail of exciting our curioſity or compaſſion, and which art can never pretend to correct. There are others, on the contrary, which call for all the attention of the ſurgeon, and in which his underſtanding and dexterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of extraordinary uſe; who leaving to the bare ſpeculative phyſician, the painful but honourable province of finding out the myſterious cauſes, his principal concern is to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0165100900:10"/>lend a helping-hand to thoſe who are thus diſfigured by nature; he omits nothing in his power to redreſs and ſet her to-rights again, by prudent and ſkilful operations; and ſometimes he is happy enough to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, either by retrenching uſeleſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous parts, or by joining thoſe which are ſeparated, or ſeparating thoſe which are joined againſt the order of nature, or by laying thoſe open and bare, which are concealed and covered. Daily practice furniſhes examples enough, to prove that I advance nothing at random: but that I may confine myſelf within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits preſcribed, I ſhall reſt ſatiſfied with giving proof thereof, by reciting an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation concerning an hermaphrodite, after having given a general idea of the different ſorts of people of faulty ſtructure of the parts of generation, who have been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by certain authors as hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites, of which others formally deny the exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the term herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodite.</note>By the term <hi>hermaphrodite,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him or her, in whom the parts, which form the eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two ſexes, are found together, either perfectly or imperfectly. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

               </gap>, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to be made up, or conſiſt of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury and Venus. In Ovid we find the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous hiſtory which has given riſe to that ſignification;<note place="margin">Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodite; its origin.</note> he makes Hermaphroditus to be the ſon of Mercury and Venus; who, ſays he, was of ſo perfect a beauty, that the nymph Salmacis fell deſperately in love with him one day, as he happened to be waſhing in a fountain where ſhe preſided; enraged for being unable to make him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her paſſion, ſhe prayed the gods to join them together in ſuch a manner, that their two bodies ſhould make but one, in which, however, the two ſexes ſhould remain accurately diſtinguiſhed; this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was granted:</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nec duo junt, ſed forma duplex, nec foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina dici</l>
                  <l>Nec puer ut poſſint: neutrumque &amp; utrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que videntur.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>"They are not two, yet the form is twofold; we cannot ſay, that it is the body of a boy or of a girl; they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though they appear to be both."</p>
            </q>
            <p>The ancient poets, fruitful in fictions, underneath that veil concealed truths,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0165100900:12"/>which happy geniuſes have ſkilfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled, by interpretations either moral or political. But the ſequel of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will poſſibly ſerve to juſtify thoſe who imagine, that the veil which covers the truth in this fable, may be ſeen through. For may we not from this fiction infer (as M. Mertru<note n="a" place="bottom">Mercure de Franc. du Mois de Fevr. 1750. Edit. Lond.</note>, who in this agrees with the Abbe de Bellegarde<note n="b" place="bottom">Auteur des Explic. ſur les Metamorph d'Ovide. Edit. de la Haye. 1735.</note>, ſays) that</p>
            <q>
               <p>"the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had a knowledge of the union of the two ſexes in one and the ſame perſon; and that this fantaſticalneſs of nature, is the origin of the fiction related by Ovid in his metamorphoſes."</p>
               <p>"Ovid has feigned," ſays the Abbe de Bellegarde, "that Hermaphroditus was the ſon of Mercury and Venus, upon the obſervations of ſome naturaliſts, who have remarked, that the children, who are born during the conjunction of theſe two planets, are ſometimes hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites, and partake of both ſexes."</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Greeks have, moreover, called theſe fort of creatures <hi>androgynes,</hi> a term which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0165100900:13"/>ſeems to be more ſignificant, in that it is derived from the two words <gap reason="foreign">

I here pretend not to fix the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reader, every one is at liberty to ſettle his ideas according to the extent of his underſtanding; my aim only is to relate the authorities of thoſe who merit our attention: I ſhall neither conteſt nor prove that Ariſtotle has talked idly, or with reaſon affirmed, that ſome herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites had the right breaſt like that of

            <p>The beſt authors who have treated this matter ſince Pareus, have followed his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; as Gaſpar Bauhin, who has writ a particular treatiſe, which is very ample, and ſo learned, that there are few works in any kind of natural hiſtory, ſo full of erudition.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0165100900:36"/>ſyncope's; I imagined that all theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, to which ſhe was ſubject from the age of puberty, and which had brought her in danger of ſinking under them, proceeded from the menſtrual blood not having liberty enough to evacuate; and that neceſſarily a more eaſy way muſt be paved for it, by opening the ſkin which cloſed up the vagina, and by maintaining in that part a ſuitable aperture. Many of the moſt celebrated ſurgeons were of my opinion; but as we agreed to perform that operation at a time the tumour of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineum ſhould appear, the patient went away home ſome miles from Paris, and was five or ſix months gone. She told me, on her return, that being almoſt brought to the point of death at the times ſhe had had her courſes upon her; and as the time of having them drew near, ſhe thought herſelf obliged to come, previous to her ſuffering what ſhe then apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet I thought it proper to make my remarks before undertaking the operation. On the morrow after her arrival, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of colick pains, fell into ſwooning fits and faintings, could not eat for all that day; her pulſe was raiſed, frequent, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0165100900:37"/>unequal. I ſeveral times touched the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineum the firſt day, without obſerving therein any thing more than ordinary; the ſecond day I began to perceive a ſmall ſwelling, but the third it became of the bigneſs of a hen's egg, without changing the colour of the ſkin; the tumour dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed conſiderably when the patient was a-bed. M. de la Brunnerie, and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made the very ſame obſervations. At length, on the cloſe of the fourth day, we ſaw the blood iſſuing out at the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a very ſmall quantity,<note place="margin">Diſcharge of the menſes.</note> of a colour rather ſerous than ſanguine; it continued flowing, but in a larger quantity for five days, of the ordinary colour. On the ſixth day the evacuation diminiſhed, and was quite dried up on the ſeventh. During all the time of the courſes, we informed ourſelves of the ſtate of the fundament, where we found not the leaſt appearance of haemorrhoids. The moſt favourable time for performing the operation, had been a month after, when the tumour was to re-appear; but the patient could only ſtay fifteen or twenty days at Paris: I was then obliged to avail myſelf of that time of neceſſity. I called together Meſſs. de la
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0165100900:38"/>Brunnerie, Carére, Guerin the elder, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, de Garengeot, Foubert, Grammont, Galin, and my father; all were of opinion (after having heard my expoſal, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the parts) that I ſhould proceed to the operation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in what manner perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>I cauſed the patient to lie on the ſide of a bed, her legs being ſupported on the knees of two of the conſultants, who held her thighs aſunder. I pinched the ſkin, which covered the vagina, tranſverſely, with the thumb and forefinger of my left-hand; Mr. Guerin laid hold alſo with his fingers on the ſame fold, on the ſide oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to that which I held; I afterwards cut that ſkin with a ſtrait biſtory, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a line perpendicular to the anus; at one ſtroke I came to a ſort of cellular texture, which I took hold on with a hook, and which I afterwards cut with a pair of ſciſſars. I conveyed my finger into the aperture, which procured me the diviſion of the cellular texture; it entered without any reſiſtance into a void or empty ſpace, which was conſidered by thoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultants, who put their finger into it, as the cavity of the vagina. This cavity ſeemed to us to have two or three inches
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0165100900:39"/>in depth, and about two in circumference. I filled it with ſeveral t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ps of lint, tied with thread. On the following day I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, for the taps of lint, a tent of 3 ½ inches long, and one in diameter. On the ſixth day of the operation, Mr. Verdier and I felt, at the end of the finger, an eminence at the bottom of the vagina,<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the touch.</note> which appeared to us to be the orifice of the part of the matrix which enters into the vagina. From the ſixth day after the operation, the patient was not dreſſed for twenty-five days that ſhe ſtayed at Paris, but with a very large tent made of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſpunge, which was never charged with purulent matter but at the parts, which anſwered to the aperture of the ſkin, whoſe edges ſuppurated a very long time. I gave pieces of prepared ſpunge to the patient to uſe herſelf. Some days after getting home, the blood of the courſes came out at the aperture which I had made for it, without a ſingle drop paſſing by the fundament; ſhe had alſo none of the ſymptoms, to which ſhe had been formerly ſubject, only for five or ſix hours before the flux, ſhe had colick pains like thoſe ſhe had always had upon her. The evacuation laſted only three days; during which time the patient
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0165100900:40"/>diſcontinued the uſe of the ſpunge, as I had directed her, and continued it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Five weeks after, the blood re-appeared ſtill by the ſame part, and flowed for three or four days. The patient imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then ſhe might be without the ſpunge. The fiſtulous orifice, that is to ſay, the aperture which I had made, appeared to be cloſed up; yet it opened on the third month to give paſſage to the blood, when it was about to re-appear. This happened ſtill for two months longer; but on the ſixth month the blood reſumed its courſe by the fundament, and all the ſymptoms, to which the patient had been ſubject before the operation, recurred upon her afreſh. She thus ſuffered ſilently, without acquainting me for eight or ten months; at the end of which time ſhe conſulted me: I had no other means to propoſe to her than the ſame operation; but particular reaſons hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſubmitting to it.</p>

M. Boudou, head-ſurgeon of that hoſpital, opened the body of this religious. The exterior parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in a chink of no great depth, ruddy within, like the part of a woman; the two edges of that chink repreſented, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly enough, the two lips of the vulva.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0165100900:48"/>African had all the proportions of body, the tone of voice, and the ways of a woman. Two peculiarities only in her parts of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, were ſufficient to impoſe on the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, namely, the clitoris and the lips of the vulva. The clitoris, as may be ſeen plate IV. which I cauſed to engrave after the original, is indeed larger and longer than in the natural ſtate, but has nothing to characteriſe the penis; the right lip, exceſſively large, compared with the other, is, with probability, ſuppoſed by Dr. Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs to include a hernia of the ovaries (it might alſo be an epiplocele) which impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on thoſe who conſidered it as a teſticle. The marking down the urethra, which I ſuppoſe to be between the nymphae, has eſcaped the accuracy of Dr. Douglaſs. Dr. Parſons's work contains ſeveral inſtances of this ſort, which he has drawn from authors; they all tend to his deſign, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the proving the opinion he is in, that there is no hermaphrodite among men; <hi>that no hermaphrodital nature can exiſt in human bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing is more common, than to hear mention made of theſe ſorts of perſons as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0165100900:49"/>hermaphrodites; and the publick would for ever be under the illuſion, if perſons of wiſdom did not endeavour to diſabuſe it.</p>

Faudacque, ſurgeon at Namur, ſays, in an obſervation which he has communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the academy of ſurgery at Paris, that he has ſeen, at three leagues diſtance from Givet, a child of eight months old, who paſſed for an hermaphrodite. The Penis was unperforated both at the glans and preputium; he made water by an orifice greatly dilated, like a ſort of vulva, ſituated immediately under the ſcrotum. As to the reſt, the penis was, ſays M. Faudacque, disfigured and monſtrous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a ſmall ſnail, was ſo curled and bent, that the extremity of the glans, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the preputium, touched the poſterior part of the root of the penis. All the part, which anſwered to the place where naturally is the canal of the ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra, appeared to be ligamentous, and ſo ſhort, as to bridle in and bend the penis in the manner I have deſcribed. When Mr. Faudacque ſaw the child for the firſt time, the teſticles were not yet come
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0165100900:50"/>down into the ſcrotum, but ſince he has obſerved them there.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mertru, ſurgeon at Paris,<note place="margin">IXth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boy, taken for an her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite.</note> has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the <hi>Mercure de France</hi> for the month of February of this year 1750, the deſcription of the parts of the body of one named Michel-Anne Drouart, aged about ſixteen, born at Paris, in the Fauxbourg St. Marceau. The ſtate of this young man, to whom M. Mertru aſcribes the character of hermaphrodite, leaves no doubt of the ſpecies of his ſex, ſince he is in London, where he arrived four or five months ago. The difficulty of finding the cauſe of the ſudden change of his ſtate, will juſtify my ſilence. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, his voice, his corpulence, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his limbs, denote very diſtinctly the male kind. He is a lad, who, for his age, is well built, but ill-formed in the parts of generation of a man, which are the only ones he has. Nature, indeed, ſeems to have forgot herſelf in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the penis; for tho' of the natural bulk, ſize, and figure, yet it is unperforated and bent downwards, being
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0165100900:51"/>forced to take that turn by a fold of the ſkin, which extends from its root to the frenum: but as nature rarely loſes on one hand, but ſhe gains on the other, ſhe has formed for herſelf a way at the root of the penis for the diſcharge of the urine and other excretions. We may compare this aperture to the meatus urinarius in women: if there is any difference, it is only in the exterior figure of this orifice, in that it forms a ſort of excreſcence, compoſed of a ſimple fold of the ſkin, which is of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milunar figure; this fold forms a cavity about three lines in depth, and admits the extremity of the little finger to lodge in it; it terminates almoſt at all the circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the meatus urinarius, and has the figure of a funnel. On removing the two ſides of this excreſcence, we obſerve in the inferior part a very delicate folding, but in which we found nothing to characterize the <hi>fourchette;</hi> this part forms, in young women eſpecially, who have had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a perfect creſcent, and raiſed much, which does not appear in this ſubject. At the bottom of the ſort of funnel I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, I find a ſmall nipple (as Mr. Mertru
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0165100900:52"/>remarks) but to us it appeared to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vice of conformation: it is placed over-againſt the urethra, and makes the jet of urine forked. The abſence of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in the two divided portions of the ſcrotum, holds ſtill to this day; but their exiſtence is for that not the leſs certain, ſince the ſubject has evacuations of ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal matter, of the ſame conſiſtence and colour with that of a man of his age, in conſequence of the erections, which, by his own confeſſion, procure him the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſex. The want of teſticles in the ſcrotum, is a defect common to a good many men, which hinders not their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great deal of vigour; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are much more able for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, on account of the heat in which theſe organs are kept<note n="a" place="bottom">This manner of ſpeaking, though improper, ceaſes not to be underſtood.</note>. <hi>I have on this ſubject a memoir both uſeful and intereſting, which I purpoſe to publiſh ſoon.</hi> As to the menſes, they have not hitherto appeared, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make me believe they ever can.</p>
            <p>We reckon then by this report, that the ſubject in queſtion, is a lad ill-formed

From between theſe lips there iſſued forth a pretty long penis, about eight inches in length, when in a ſtate of erection; it was well formed, but without any preputium. There was, beſides, no appearance of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; the urine and ſemen iſſued out as in a man, through the canal of the urethra but what was more extraordinary, the menſes paſſed regularly every month thro' the ſame canal.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0165100900:54"/>be ranked under the ſpecies of perfect her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodites: but as the perſon, who is the ſubject thereof, never had any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and as there is no proof it ever begot any, this might be made a handle of to charge us with being inclined to decide too lightly. The readers therefore will be left at liberty to give to this ſubject what character they ſhall judge to ſuit beſt to it.</p>
            <p>The obſervation is owing to M. Gallay, ſurgeon of Gargenville near Mantes in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, who has ſubmitted it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the academy of ſurgery of Paris.</p>
            <p>On the 27th of March 1740, being, ſays he, at the village of Iſſou near Mantes, I learned they were to bury, that very day, a woman who had paſſed for an herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodite; I arrived at the moment they were about to convey the body into the earth. I begged of the huſband to allow me to examine her, which he granted, on condition I ſhould not open her. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts appeared to me to conſiſt of the lips, the nymphae, &amp;c. At the ſuperior angle of the great chink, where the clitoris
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0165100900:55"/>ſhould be, there was a well-conditioned penis, the glans was proportional, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in part with its preputium, was as perfectly crowned as that of a man; at the extremity of this glans, there was an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, into which I introduced a probe, which entered quite into the bladder, from which iſſued out the little urine it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. This penis was three inches ſix lines in length, and three inches four lines in circumference. The urine had no other outlet than by this canal. I diſcovered no teſticles, the great lips were the parts which ſhould naturally contain them; the vagina was placed, as uſual, at the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part of the vulva; thither I introduced my fingers; with their extremities I felt the orifice of the matrix, whoſe edges were hard, and, as it were, cartilaginous. The huſband withdrew for a moment; I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this time of abſence in opening the belly, in hopes of finding there the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; my expectation proved vain, I found nothing that had any relation to theſe parts; the ovaries, the tubae fallopianae, the womb, were ſcirrhous. The return of the huſband prevented the carrying any farther my curioſity. There is room to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0165100900:56"/>believe, that the penis conſiſted of all the parts neceſſary to its actions, ſince the huſband aſſured me, that it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a ſtate of erection. I could not learn, whether in that ſtate it had ever diſcharged any ſort of ſeminal matter. As to the reſt, this woman had had her courſes in her youth, never had had any children; her face was thick ſet with a beard, the tone of her voice was manniſh.</p>
