            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY inſcribing this ſlight performance to you, I do not mean ſo much to compliment you as myſelf. It may do me ſome honour to inform the public, that I have lived many years in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with you.

            <p>I have, particularly, reaſon to thank you for your partiality to this performance. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking a comedy, not merely ſentimental, was very dangerous; and Mr. Colman, who ſaw this piece in its various ſtages, always thought it ſo. However I ventured to truſt it to the public; and though it was neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed till late in the ſeaſon, I have every reaſon to be grateful.</p>

               <l>I'm crying now—and have been all the week!</l>

                  <hi>'Tis not alone this mourning ſuit,</hi> good maſters;</l>

               <l>The Comic muſe, long ſick, is now a dying!</l>
               <l>And if ſhe goes, my tears will never ſtop;</l>
               <l>For as a play'r, I can't ſqueeze out one drop:</l>
               <l>I am undone, that's all—ſhall loſe my bread—</l>
               <l>I'd rather, but that's nothing—loſe my head.</l>

                  <hi>Shuter</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſhall be chief mourners here.</l>

               <l>They'll turn us out, and no one elſe will take us,</l>
               <l>But why can't I be moral?—Let me try—</l>
               <l>My heart thus preſſing—fix'd my face and eye—</l>
               <l>With a ſententious look, that nothing means,</l>

               <hi>WELL,</hi> having ſtoop'd to conquer with ſucceſs,</l>
            <l>And gain'd a huſband without aid from dreſs,</l>

            <l>And let me ſay, for all your reſolution,</l>
            <l>That pretty Bar-maids have done execution.</l>
            <l>Our life is all a play, compos'd to pleaſe,</l>
            <l>"We have our exits and our entrances."</l>
            <l>The firſt act ſhews the ſimple country maid,</l>
            <l>Harmleſs and young, of ev'ry thing aſraid;</l>
            <l>Bluſhes when hir'd, and with unmeaning action,</l>
            <l>I hopes as how to give you ſatisfaction.</l>
            <l>Her ſecond act diſplays a livelier ſcene,—</l>
            <l>Th' unbluſhing Bar-maid of a country inn.</l>
            <l>Who whiſks about the houſe, at market caters,</l>
            <l>Talks loud, coquets the gueſts, and ſcolds the waiters.</l>
            <l>Next the ſcene ſhifts to town, and there ſhe ſoars,</l>
            <l>The chop houſe toaſt of ogling connoiſſieurs.</l>
            <l>On 'Squires and Cits ſhe there diſplays her arts,</l>
            <l>And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts—</l>
            <l>And as ſhe ſmiles, her triumphs to compleat,</l>
            <l>Even Common Councilmen forget to eat.</l>
            <l>The fourth act ſhews her wedded to the 'Squire,</l>

Pretends to taſte, at Operas cries <hi>caro,</hi>

               <p>I Vow, Mr. Hardcaſtle, you're very particular. Is there a creature in the whole country, but our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that does not take a trip to town now and then, to rub off the ruſt a little? There's the two Miſs Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grigſby, go to take a month's poliſhing every winter.</p>

               <p>Ay, and bring back vanity and affectation to laſt them the whole year. I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home. In my time, the follies of the town crept ſlowly among us, but now they travel faſter than a ſtage-coach. Its fopperies come down, not only as inſide paſſengers, but in the very baſket.</p>

               <p>Ay, <hi>your</hi> times were fine times, indeed; you have been telling us of <hi>them</hi> for many a long year. Here we live in an old rumbling manſion, that looks for all the world like an inn, but that we never ſee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Our beſt viſitors are old Mrs. Oddfiſh, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-maſter: And all our entertainment your old ſtories of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough.

               <p>Lord, Mr. Hardcaſtle, you're for ever at your Dorothy's and your old wife's. You may be a Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but I'll be no Joan, I promiſe you. I'm not ſo old as you'd make me, by more than one good year. Add twenty to twenty, and make money of that.</p>

               <p>It's falſe, Mr. Hardcaſtle: I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony, that I had by Mr. Lumpkin, my firſt huſband; and he's not come to years of diſcretion yet.</p>

               <p>Nor ever will, I dare anſwer for him. Ay, you have taught <hi>him</hi> finely.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>I'd ſooner allow him an horſe-pond. If burning the footmens ſhoes, frighting the maids, and worry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kittens, be humour, he has it. It was but yeſterday he faſtened my wig to the back of my chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always too ſickly to do any good. A ſchool would be his death. When he comes to be a little ſtronger, who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>Latin for him! A cat and fiddle. No, no, the ale-houſe and the ſtable are the only ſchools he'll ever go to.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>Well, we muſt not ſnub the poor boy now, for I believe we ſhan't have him long among us. Any body that looks in his face may ſee he's conſumptive.</p>

               <p>He's a very ſingular character, I aſſure you. Among women of reputation and virtue, he is the modeſteſt man alive; but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another ſtamp: you underſtand me.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>An odd character, indeed. I ſhall never be able

to manage him. What ſhall I do? Pſhaw, think no more of him, but truſt to occurrences for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But how goes on your own affair my dear, has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony, as uſual?</p>

               <speaker>Miſs NEVILLE.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>And her partiality is ſuch, that ſhe actually thinks him ſo. A fortune like your's is no ſmall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides, as ſhe has the ſole management of it, I'm not ſurprized to ſee her unwilling to let it go out of the family.</p>

               <speaker>Miſs NEVILLE.</speaker>
               <p>A fortune like mine, which chiefly conſiſts in jewels, is no ſuch mighty temptation. But at any rate if my dear Haſtings be but conſtant, I make no doubt to be too hard for her at laſt. However, I let her ſuppoſe that I am in love with her ſon, and ſhe never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another.</p>

               <p>My dear Marlow! But I'll ſuppreſs the emotion. Were I a wretch, meanly ſeeking to carry off a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, you ſhould be the laſt man in the world I would apply to for aſſiſtance. But Miſs Neville's perſon is all I aſk, and that is mine, both from her deceaſed father's conſent, and her own inclination.</p>

This ſtammer in my addreſs, and this aukward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing viſage of mine, can never permit me to ſoar above the reach of a milliner's 'prentice, or one of the dutcheſſes of Drury-lane.

               <p>WHAT could my old friend Sir Charles mean by recommending his ſon as the modeſteſt young man in town? To me he appears the moſt impudent piece of braſs that ever ſpoke with a tongue. He has taken poſſeſſion of the eaſy chair by the fire-ſide already. He took off his boots in the parlour, and deſired me to ſee them taken care of. I'm deſirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter.—She will certainly be ſhocked at it.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>Enter Miſs HARDCASTLE, plainly dreſs'd.</stage>

               <p>I find ſuch a pleaſure, Sir, in obeying your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that I take care to obſerve them without ever debating their propriety.</p>

               <p>Ay, he learned it all abroad,—what a fool was I, to think a young man could learn modeſty by travelling. He might as ſoon learn wit at a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems all natural to him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>Then your firſt ſight deceived you; for I think him one of the moſt brazen firſt ſights that ever aſtoniſhed my ſenſes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>Surprizing! He met me with a reſpectful bow, a ſtammering voice, and a look fixed on the ground.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>He met me with a loud voice, a lordly air, and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>He treated me with diffidence and reſpect; cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the manners of the age; admired the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of girls that never laughed; tired me with apologies for being tireſome; then left the room with a bow, and, madam, I would not for the world detain you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>He ſpoke to me as if he knew me all his life before. Aſked twenty queſtions, and never waited for an anſwer. Interrupted my beſt remarks with ſome ſilly pun, and when I was in my beſt ſtory of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, he aſked if I had not a good hand at making punch. Yes, Kate, he aſk'd your father if he was a maker of punch!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>One of us muſt certainly be miſtaken.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>If he be what he has ſhewn himſelf, I'm deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined he ſhall never have my conſent.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs HARDCASTLE.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. But upon conditions. For if you ſhould find him leſs impudent, and I more preſuming; if you find him more reſpectful, and I more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate—I don't know—the fellow is well enough for a man—Certainly we don't meet many ſuch at a horſe race in the country.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
               <p>If we ſhould find him ſo—But that's impoſſible. The firſt appearance has done my buſineſs. I'm ſeldom deceived in that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Ay, when a girl finds a fellow's outſide to her taſte, ſhe then ſets about gueſſing the reſt of his furniture. With her, a ſmooth face ſtands for good ſenſe, and a genteel figure for every virtue.</p>

               <p>Pardon me, Kate. But if young Mr. Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions, he may pleaſe us both, perhaps.</p>

               <p>By heavens, Madam, fortune was ever my ſmalleſt conſideration. Your beauty at firſt caught my eye; for who could ſee that without emotion. But every moment that I converſe with you, ſteals in ſome new grace, heightens the picture, and gives it ſtronger expreſſion. What at firſt ſeem'd ruſtic plainneſs, now appears refin'd ſimplicity. What ſeem'd forward aſſurance, now ſtrikes me as the reſult of courageous innocence, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous virtue.</p>

               <p>I am now determined to ſtay, Madam, and I have too good an opinion of my father's diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he ſees you, to doubt his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>No, Mr. Marlow, I will not, cannot detain you. Do you think I could ſuffer a connexion, in which there is the ſmalleſt room for repentance? Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a tranſient paſſion, to load you with confuſion? Do you think I could ever reliſh that happineſs, which was acquired by leſſening your's?</p>

               <p>By all that's good, I can have no happineſs but what's in your power to grant me. Nor ſhall I ever feel repentance, but in not having ſeen your merits before. I will ſtay, even contrary to your wiſhes; and tho' you ſhould perſiſt to ſhun me, I

               <p>Sir, I muſt entreat you'll deſiſt. As our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance began, ſo let it end, in indifference. I might have given an hour or two to levity; but feriouſly, Mr. Marlow, do you think I could ever ſubmit to a connexion, where <hi>I</hi> muſt appear mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, and <hi>you</hi> imprudent? Do you think I could ever catch at the confident addreſſes of a ſecure admirer?</p>
