            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Scenes, fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how much he owes to the talents of the <hi>Actor,</hi> the <hi>Muſician,</hi> and the <hi>Painter,</hi> can derive no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence from the ſucceſs of the repreſentation, when he delivers them over to the judgement of the cloſet: But deficient as he may be in the execution of this eſſay, he cannot ſubmit to be thought ignorant in the principles of Dramatic Writing; and would willingly premiſe the origin and progreſs of his deſign, as an explanation, if not a juſtification, of ſome of its imperfections.</p>
            <p>Every one may remember how much the Fête Champétre, given by a noble Lord laſt ſummer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the public curioſity: It was thought, that to preſerve for a more general diſplay, an entertainment of ſo ſingular and elegant a kind, would be not only pleaſing to the public, but ſerviceable to the polite arts. Accordingly, permiſſion having been obtained to employ the muſic, and to copy ſome of the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, a plan was projected for adapting them to the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0163800700:3"/>
The Fable, by the means of which they were to be introduced, being only the ſecondary object, and the intention <hi>then</hi> to confine the repreſentation to two acts, a plot of the utmoſt ſimplicity was judged the moſt proper; and in that deciſion the Author reſts upon the example of Moliere, and many of the beſt criticks, of, perhaps, the beſt age in Theatrical Hiſtory; who, in pieces of this nature, though they introduced charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of comedy, purpoſely avoided, in ſeveral inſtances, thoſe intricacies and combinations of incidents, which generally, but perhaps falſly, are ſuppoſed eſſential to a regular Drama.</p>
            <p>It is not the buſineſs of this preface to draw a parallel between the Engliſh and French Stages, but it may not be out of place, juſt to touch the characters of each, provided it be permitted to lay Shakeſpear out of the queſtion: He ſtands ſingle and inimitable; his excellencies cannot be weighed, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to counter-ballance the ſcale. Without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal therefore to his almoſt ſupernatural powers, we may pronounce the properties of our Stage, whether conſidered in Tragedy or Comedy, to conſiſt in energy, ſpirit, ſublimity, force of character, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion—like the Hercules of Farneſe, all is muſcle and nerve—with equal truth it muſt be confeſſed, that a few examples excepted, and thoſe not much in the courſe of acting at preſent, we muſt turn to France to find the graces of the Apollo—art, regularity, elegance, delicacy, touches of ſentiment, adapted only to the
<pb facs="tcp:0163800700:4"/>
moſt poliſhed manners, diſtinguiſh their Theatres. In literary warfare, we call their compoſitions inſipid; they deſcribe ours as barbarous—both are unjuſt—all will agree, that to blend ſtrength and refinement would be to attain perfection.</p>
            <p>No candid reader will ſuppoſe the Author of this piece means to infer, that he has in any degree accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed this union, in the part which has fallen to his ſhare; but, he will be bold to ſay, it is the only part which has been wanting to complete a ſpecies of entertainment new to this country; elegant in its principle, and innocent, if not beneficial, in its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. He will be amply rewarded, even in the failure of his ſpecimen, if it excites others, who may be better qualified, to purſue the ſame ideas.</p>
            <p>They who ſuppoſe an Engliſh audience, becauſe uſed to plain entertainment, are incapable of reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt refined, are greatly miſtaken. It is true, there will ever be ſpectators in the two extremes of the houſe, who are taſteleſs and deſpicable—to the honour of the town be it ſaid, they are but few—and whether they bawl for a hornpipe from the Upper Gallery, or yawn in the wearineſs of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in the Boxes, they equally betray ſtupidity, prejudice, or caprice: But the middle claſs and bulk of the aſſembly, like that of the kingdom at large, will ever be on the ſide of nature, truth, and ſenſe. Let the piece be founded upon thoſe principles,
<pb facs="tcp:0163800700:5"/>
and applauſe will follow every circumſtance of elegance and decoration that can accompany them.</p>
            <p>A ſincere zeal for the improvement of the ſtage, has prompted this digreſſion. It is requiſite now to return, for a moment, to the hiſtory of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>Mr. Garrick, after peruſing the outlines of the two original acts, thought he diſcovered in the writer ſome talents for the higher ſpecies of comedy, and encouraged him to extend his plan. The ſcenery alſo, which in the firſt ſketches promiſed a brilliant effect; the compoſition of the muſic, and the names of the dancers who were engaged, all ſeemed to require more diſtinction than could be given to them in an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece. But the moſt prevalent incentive to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, was the promiſe of Mr. Garrick's aſſiſtance; his judgement pervaded the whole, and though it may diminiſh the poet, it is the pride of the friend, to make a public acknowledgement to that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in the words of Horace to Melpomene,

                  <p>DEAR Charles, welcome to England! and doubly welcome to Oldſworth's Oaks—Friendſhip I ſee has wings, as well as love—you arrive at the moment I wiſhed; I hope in your haſte you have not forgot a fancy dreſs.</p>

                  <p>Who, in the name of curioſity, is ſhe that bears this romantic title? for your letter was a mere eclogue; the devil a thing could I make out, but a rhapſody upon rural innocence, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation from a gentleman I did not know, to an entertainment I never ſaw—What, are we to have a repreſentation of the Paſtor-fido in a Garden?</p>

                  <p>An orphan ward of the worthy old gentleman, at whoſe ſeat you now are: His character is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and as amiable in its way as her's. Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting a great eſtate, and liberally educated, his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0163800700:13"/>
diſpoſition led him early to a country life, where his benevolence and hoſpitality are boundleſs; and theſe qualities, joined with an imagination bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon the whimſical, have given a peculiar turn to the manners of the neighbourhood, that, in my opinion, degrades the poliſh of courts—but judge of the original.</p>

                  <p>To be worthy of your's, Sir Harry, is the beſt recommendation. <stage>(To Dupeley)</stage>—Sir, your friend is going to receive from my hands, a lovely girl, whoſe merit he has diſcern'd and lov'd for its own ſake: Such nuptials ſhould recal the ideas of a better age; he has permitted me to celebrate them upon my own plan, and I ſhall be happy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the judgement of an accompliſh'd critic.</p>

                  <p>Sir, by what I already ſee of Oldworth's Oaks, and know of the character of the maſter, I am perſuaded the talent moſt neceſſary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will be that of giving due praiſe.</p>

                  <p>He has all the prejudices of his years, and wordly knowledge; the common old Gentleman's character—You may ſee it in every drama from the days of Terence, to thoſe of Congreve; though not perhaps with quite ſo much good humour, and ſo little obſtinacy as my Uncle ſhews. He is ever moſt impetuous, when moſt kind; and I dare truſt his reſentment will end with a dramatic forgiveneſs. Should it not, I may have pride in the ſacrifice of his eſtate, but no regret.—So much for fortune, Charles—are there any other means to reconcile me to your approbation?</p>

more patience than it deſerves, and ſhould at laſt be out of humour with ſuch an importation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and affectation, if I was not ſure your good ſenſe would ſoon get the better of it. This is called knowing the world—to form notions without, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ever ſeeing a man in his natural character, or converſing with a woman of principle: and then, for fear of being impoſed upon, be really dup'd out of the moſt valuable feelings in human nature, confidence in friendſhip, and eſteem in love.</p>

                  <p>My mind is incapable of reſerve with you; the moſt generous of men, is on the point of giving his hand to your—what ſhall I call myſelf? I am almoſt nameleſs, but as the creature of your bounty and cares, this title gives me a value in my own eyes; but I fear it is all I have to boaſt. The myſtery you have kept, makes me apprehenſive there is ſomething in my origin ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed—what am I to interpret from your ſmiles?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Every thing that is contrary to your ſurmiſes: be patient, ſweet Maid of the Oaks; before night all myſteries ſhall be cleared. It is not an ordinary wedding I celebrate, I prepare a feaſt for the heart—Lady Bab Lardoon, as I live!—the princeſs of diſſipation! catch an obſervation of her while you can, Maria; for though ſhe has been but three days out of London, ſhe is as uneaſy as a mole in ſun-ſhine, and would expire, if ſhe did not ſoon dive into her old element again.</p>

                  <p>Dear Maria, I am happy to be the firſt of your company to congratulate you—well, Mr. Oldworth, I am delighted with the idea of your Féte; it is ſo novel, ſo French, ſo expreſſive of what every body
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0163800700:29"/>
underſtands, and nobody can explain; then there is ſomething ſo ſpirited in an undertaking of ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pence, where a ſhower of rain would ſpoil it all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>OLDWORTH.</speaker>
                  <p>I did not expect to eſcape from ſo fine a lady, but you and the world have free leave to comment upon all you ſee here.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Laugh where you muſt, be candid where you can.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>I only hope that to celebrate a joyful event upon any plan, that neither hurts the morals, or polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the company, and at the ſame time ſets thouſands of the induſtrious to work, cannot be thought blame worthy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, quite the contrary, and I am ſure it will have a run; a force upon the ſeaſons and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is the true teſt of a refined taſte, and it holds good from a cucumber at Chriſtmas, to an Italian opera.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>MARIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Is the rule the ſame among the ladies, lady Bab; is it alſo a definition of their refinement to act in all things contrary to nature?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>Not abſolutely in all things, though more ſo than people are apt to imagine; for even in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that ſeem moſt natural, faſhion prompts ten times, where inclination prompts once; and there would be an end of gallantry in this country, if it was not for the ſake of reputation.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, that a woman without a connection,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0163800700:30"/>
grows every day a more awkward perſonage; one might as well go into company without powder—if one does not <hi>really</hi> deſpiſe old vulgar prejudices, it is abſolutely neceſſary to affect it, or one muſt ſit at home alone.</p>

                  <p>This is new, indeed; I always ſuppoſed that in places where freedom of manners was moſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, a woman of unimpeachable conduct carried a certain reſpect.</p>

                     <stage>(ſmiling)</stage> I believe I had better ſtay in the <hi>Oakery,</hi> as you call it; for I am afraid I ſhall never procure any <hi>civility</hi> in town, upon the terms required.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, my dear, you have choſe a horrid word to expreſs the intercourſe of the bon ton; <hi>civility</hi> may be very proper in a mercer, when one is chuſing a

ſilk, but <hi>familiarity</hi> is the life of good company. I believe this is quite ſince your time Mr. Oldworth, but 'tis by far the greateſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the beau monde ever made.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>OLDWORTH.</speaker>
                  <p>A certain eaſe was always an eſſential part of good breeding, but lady Bab muſt explain her meaning a little further, before we can decide upon the improvement.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>I mean that participation of ſociety, in which the French uſed to excel, and we have now ſo much outdone our models—I maintain, that among the <hi>ſuperior</hi> ſet—mind, I only ſpeak of them—our men and women are put more upon a footing together in London, than they ever were before in any age or country.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>By the moſt charming of all inſtitutions, wherein we ſhew the world, that liberty is as well underſtood by our women as by our men; we have our <hi>Bill of Rights</hi> and our <hi>Conſtitution</hi> too, as well as they—we drop in at all hours, play at all parties, pay our own reckonings, and in every circumſtance (pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats excepted) are true lively jolly fellows.</p>

                  <speaker>OLDWORTH.</speaker>
                  <p>Paying of reckonings is I confeſs new ſince my time; and I ſhould be afraid it might ſometimes be a little heavy upon a lady's pocket.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, all the ſervants may be put to board wages, or ſent into the country, except the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—no plunder of houſe-keepers, or maitres de hotel, no long butcher's bills—Lady Squander pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts ſhe has wanted no proviſion in her family theſe ſix months, except potatoes to feed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and a few frogs for the French governeſs—then our dinner-ſocieties are ſo amuſing, all the doves and hawks together, and one converſes ſo freely; there's no topick of White's or Almack's, in which we do not bear a part.</p>

                  <p>Sir Harry, I rejoice at your happineſs—and do not think me ſo taſteleſs, Maria, as not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an attachment like yours, preferable to all others, when it can be had—<hi>filer le parfait amour,</hi> is the firſt happineſs in life: But that you know is totally out of the queſtion in town; the matrimonial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in <hi>our</hi> way, are abſolutely reduced to two; to

plague a man, and to bury him; the glory is to plague him firſt, and <hi>bury him</hi> afterwards.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>I heartily congratulate Lady Bab. and all who are to partake of her converſation, upon her being able to bring ſo much vivacity into the country.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady BAB.</speaker>
                  <p>Nothing but the Fête Champétre could have effected it, for I ſet out in miſerable ſpirits—I had a horrid run before I left town—I ſuppoſe you ſaw my name in the papers.</p>

                  <p>Oh, but you will have it—the Fête Champétre will be a delightful ſubject!—To be complimented one day, laugh'd at the next, and abuſed the third; you can't imagine how amuſing it is to read one's own name at breakfaſt in a morning paper.</p>

                  <p>Lord, a great while, and in all its ſtages: They firſt began with a modeſt inuendo, "<hi>we hear a certain Lady, not a hundred miles from Hanoverſquare, loſt, at one ſitting, ſome nights ago, two thouſund guineas</hi>—O tempora! O mores!"</p>

                  <p>None but my intimates did, for it was applicable to half St. George's pariſh; but about a week after they honoured me with initials and italicks: "It is ſaid, Lady B.

                  <p>He is only gone to dreſs; I appointed to meet him on the other ſide the Grove; he'll be here in twenty minutes.</p>

                  <p>I'll attend him there in your place—I have it—I'll try my hand a little at <hi>naivetè</hi>—he never ſaw me—the dreſs I am going to put on for the Fête will do admirably to impoſe upon him: I'll make an example of his hypocriſy, and his <hi>graces,</hi> and his <hi>uſage du monde.</hi>

                  <p>Excuſe me, brother, Madam, all—my ſtory is very ſhort, Maria; the hour of your birth made <hi>me</hi> a widower, and <hi>you</hi> a ſplendid heireſs; I trembled at the dangers of that ſituation, made more dangerous by the loſs of your mother—to be the object of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in the very cradle, and made a prey to intereſt is the common lot attending it—Theſe reflections, call them whim, call them ſingularities, what you pleaſe, induced me to conceal your birth; being abroad at the time, the plan was eaſily executed.</p>
