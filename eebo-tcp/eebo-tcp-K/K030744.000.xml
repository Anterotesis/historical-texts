            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <q>AUDI ALTERAM PARTEM.</q>
            <p>IT is now well known with what little truth hemlock was recommended as a cure for cancers, Dr. De Haen of Vienna, phyſician in the ſame hoſpital with Dr. Storck, having given us a fair account of this matter.</p>
            <p>In a letter to a phyſician in England, publiſhed in the third volume of the Medical Muſeum, he ſays, ſpeaking of the Cicuta, <q>
                  <p>"I am now able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this matter to you, from the many experiments I have made in
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0218200600:5"/>conſequence of an order received from high authority. The firſt thirty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients it abſolutely failed me, but confiding in the good faith of others, that they might happen to be ſuch only as were incurable, I advanced to make further trials, as well publicly in the hoſpital, as privately in the city and ſuburbs, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one hundred and twenty; but, unhappily for me, after ſo much trouble, the reſult was, that not one perſon was cured or relieved by it; that many grew worſe, and that ſeven unhappy women with cancers in their breaſts periſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hands, of whom I could have ſaved ſome of them by the knife, and in all probability others might have been preſerved a long time by the palliative methods."</p>
                  <p>"I muſt own, ſir, I am aſhamed of this affair. How did I intreat
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0218200600:6"/>thoſe to whom it belonged to uſe more precaution, and at leaſt to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for ſome time the printing of thoſe books that praiſe the Cicuta, till repeated trials had been made, and by ſeveral hands, leſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith ſhould be abuſed by a premature publication, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor rendered ridiculous in the face of the univerſe. But my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances were fruitleſs; and, to my great concern, my beſt friends abruptly fell out with me, and I have incurred the diſgrace of the beſt of ſovereigns."</p>
               </q> Wherefore, three years after, in 1766, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his <hi>Epiſtola de Cicuta,</hi> wherein he denies the cures which Dr. Storck ſaid he had accompliſhed by this remedy, and maintains it, <q>"that many, or moſt of thoſe very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Dr. Storck aſſerts to have been perfectly cured, died while they were taking this medicine;
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0218200600:7"/>and that there was proved in reality, on a candid enquiry, no more than one that could be ſaid to be cured by hemlock; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though five hundred pounds weight of Dr. Storck's extract of Cicuta had been ſent to different places abroad, yet there has not been received one authentic account of a real cure of a true cancer having been ever yet performed by it in any inſtance where it was uſed."</q> Which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agrees with general experience; and indeed it is amazing, that it ſhould ever have been received as a ſpecific in this diſorder, when we reflect, that upon enquiry, by diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into the nature of a confirmed ſchirrhus, the veſſels ate found to be perfectly deſtroyed and obliterated, and the whole to be one confuſed maſs; wherefore, any medicine cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of reſtoring a part thus diſeaſed, muſt have a power of creating a new
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0218200600:8"/>ſet of veſſels, and of making a new gland of the old one; and we may as well believe that it has a power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving any inconvenience from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, by creating a new limb, as that it cured a true ſchirrhus<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe who will take the trouble of examining ſchirri with a good microſcope, will look with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation upon the accounts he meets with in Dr. Storck's books, and will be convinced, that unleſs we can diſcover a medicine that will penetrate into, correct the cancerous virus, and diſſolve all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed parts into matter, we muſt ſtill continue to remove cancers in time by the knife, or what is more tedious and painful, the cauſtic, if we think of curing the patient.</note>.</p>
            <p>But when we reflect how deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute we were of any medicine cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of curing a cancer, we ſhall ſee the reaſon why phyſicians and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons ſhould ſeek with avidity after a medicine recommended for this purpoſe by a phyſician of eminence
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0218200600:9"/>and character; and finding it give eaſe in ſome inſtances, its uſe has been continued, not conſidering that it is an opiate, and that the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage might have been received from ſmall doſes of opium; and that both opium and hemlock lull the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient into a fatal ſecurity, while the neceſſary and proper methods are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and the diſeaſe makes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable progreſs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, the writer of the Eſſay on the Kinkcough is a true diſciple of Dr. Storck; and if this publication is well received, we have reaſon given to expect a more extenſive account of the virtues of hemlock; wherefore it muſt be a thankful office to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how far what is already ſaid by this writer merits attention, and whether, as he aſſerts, <q>"it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific in the kinkcough, according to the moſt proper interpretation of
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0218200600:10"/>that word,"</q> to prevent our being again haſtily led, in giving preference to a medicine, perhaps no ways en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the encomiums beſtowed on it.</p>
            <p>Although by ſhewing that the caſes Dr, B— has given are inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to recommend hemlock, and that he himſelf does not believe what he has ſaid in favour of this medicine to be true, we might anſwer all the ends propoſed; yet, as theory is apt to affect practice, it will be proper to examine his doctrine previous to his caſes, and more eſpecially as it will ſhew this imitator of THESSALUS<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader who is not acquainted with medical hiſtory, muſt be informed, that THESSALUS lived in the time of NERO, and with madneſs railed in open invectives againſt all phyſicians. He even had the vanity to direct, that the word IATRONICES ſhould be written upon his tomb-ſtone, in hopes of having it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that he was ſuperior in his profeſſion to any phyſician that ever lived. Plin. Hiſt.Nat. lib. xxix. cap. 1.</note>,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0218200600:11"/>that he, like other men, is not quite free from imperfection; that there muſt be a great amendment to make, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects his name greater in the next century than any man that ever lived; and knowing himſelf, he may ſee the neceſſity of ſtill improving.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>To Dr. B*****.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE read your Treatiſe on the Kink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough, and willingly point out to you ſome overſights in this work, in hopes of improving your medical knowledge, and thereby enabling you better to ſupport the character you have ſo long aſſumed, of being "ſecond in the profeſſion to no man."</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſir, your ſtricture upon DOCTOR FO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERGILL, in the beginning of your Preface, ſeems not only to be unneceſſary, but a little unlucky to yourſelf; becauſe, I dare ſay, you might have gone on in your ſyſtem-building quietly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice; whereas, from what you have there ſaid, people will naturally be led to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the two writers that cannot poſſibly turn out to your advantage.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0218200600:13"/>
               <p>They will at once plainly ſee that you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and perplexed your ſubject, by treading in the path he has avoided. Thoſe converſant with medical books will diſcover, that you have ſerved your HEMLOCK up in a haſh of old materials; and that you have not advanced one new obſervation, or even one new thought, except ſome new errors, which it was quite unneceſſary to add to the theory and practice of phyſic. Beſides, I apprehend, your book will be thought to border a little upon quackery; while it muſt be confeſſed, that the DOCTOR has written like a man of ſcience.</p>
               <p>Whoever looks over the 30th article, in the third volume of the Medical Obſervations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, will find that he recommends, from the ſucceſs of himſelf and many of his medical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, a powder compoſed of crabs claws and emetic tartar, as a very uſeful medicine in the taſſis convulſiva, and in preference of oxymel of ſquills and ipecacuanha, which have ſo often afforded moſt relief, by emptying the ſtomach of its contents; and he has mentioned the manner of giving it, and the diet he has found moſt uſeful on this occaſion. And, ſurely, there can be no impropriety in his confirming, by the experience of himſelf and many phyſicians, the uſefulneſs of a medicine which has been adviſed by preceding writers. And why is his giving directions about the manner of its being taken, and laying down rules for diet, unworthy of him, when ſo great a man as yourſelf has imitated him in theſe particulars<note n="*" place="bottom">Treatiſe on the Kinkcough, p. 169.</note>?</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0218200600:14"/>
               <p>But he ſays, the remedy he recommends is not a certain cure in all caſes; he would not be underſtood to ſuppoſe, that it will alone complete the cure of the whooping-cough; ſays he, <q>"I know it will not; and that this, as well as any other medicine, is uſeful or otherwiſe, juſt as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated:"</q> whereas you happen not to trouble your head about indications, but recommend hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock <hi>as a ſpecific</hi> in the diſorder under conſideration.</p>
               <p>A ſpecific in the whooping-cough is a deſireable remedy, if it could be obtained; but whether that you have adviſed is better than the <hi>fleſh of fryed mice,</hi> which has been in vogue as a ſpecific for the ſame purpoſe; may be much doubted; for ſuch is the difference of conſtitutions, the variations in the ſame diſeaſe, and in the combinations of diſeaſes; that no one remedy has hitherto been found out, capable of invariably curing any one diſorder. Quacks, therefore, only talk of curing diſeaſes under various circumſtances by a ſpecific: they, indeed, from a poverty of knowledge, recommend one remedy in all ſorts of complaints, and bring teſtimony of their uſe from every recovery which happens where they are given. You, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, have, for ſeveral years, been preſcribing hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock in almoſt all the caſes which have come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and now aſcribe effects to it of which there is no evidence. I will point out an inſtance, which may ſerve for the preſent. You ſay, it may be given in the ſmall-pox <hi>with advantage,</hi> becauſe it was taken by an healthy boy and girl, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the eruptive fever of this diſeaſe, after emptying their bowels by ſenna tea, and the ſmall-pox
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0218200600:15"/>turned out a very diſtinct good ſort. Now, if there had never before been a very diſtinct good ſort of ſmall-pox, in an healthy boy and girl, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after purging, the hemlock might have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome credit; but if, upon enquiry, it ſhould be diſcovered, that a diſtinct good ſort of ſmall-pox is not unfrequent where hemlock is not given, I rather think, no other concluſion can be drawn from theſe inſtances than that, like a chip in pottage, it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did good nor harm.</p>
               <p>Nor can Dr. STORCK ſhelter you, I am fearful, from the appearance of having made a random ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, if even what he ſays be true; for, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>hemlock,</hi> in ſome inſtances, to have promoted a kindly ſuppuration where the Peruvian bark failed; yet it does not follow, that it will promote a kindly ſuppuration in the ſmall-pox; becauſe different kinds of acrid matter require different correctives: though we no way accuſe you of making a random experiment by deſign, but inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, without knowing that matter in ſores and the matter in the ſmall-pox may require different remedies.</p>
               <p>However, though you have been a little out in theſe things, yet your declaration of not being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for other peoples experiments with hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, unleſs made with the very preparation you always uſe<note n="*" place="bottom">No one will doubt, though Dr. B— has publiſhed his methods of preparing hemlock, that he means, by this caveat, the preparation made by his own apothecary, when they know that he is provided with a ſufficient quantity to ſerve the whole kingdom.</note>, may ſcreen you from reproach where

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the ſeat of the kinkcough.</head>
            <p>Though you aſſert that arguments are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, yet you are ſo deſtitute of plain proof, that you have not produced one fact in ſupport
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0218200600:22"/>of your opinion, that the inteſtinal canal is the primary ſeat of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>That particular diſeaſes affect particular parts, is known to every one; but you will find it a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to prove, <q>"the meaſles <hi>chiefly</hi> affect the membrane inveſting the lungs, the ſmall-pox that of the ſtomach, and agues that of the duodenum."</q>—That the inteſtines of children are more irritable than the other parts of the body, will be equally difficult to prove. Dentition ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all the nerves in the body praeternaturally irritable; and the colic-pains, and the like, do not ſeem to ariſe from the nerves of the inteſtines being more irritable, but from their being more irritated, by an acid firſt generated in the ſtomach. Nor has Dr. Harris <hi>proved,</hi> that almoſt all the diſeaſes of children depend on an affection of the firſt paſſages; or who would believe that the CROUP for inſtance, had its ſeat in the inteſtines, becauſe <hi>he</hi> ſaid the complaints of infants ſpring from an acid, their common ſource; and though it be allowed that a diſeaſe in the inteſtines can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole, or any part of the nervous ſyſtem, and that worms lodging in the inteſtines can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a cough, yet it does not follow, that all coughs happening to children have their primary ſeat in the ſame place: we could inconteſtably prove, that a violent cough took its riſe from an inflammatory tumour in the hand; but, are we therefore to conclude, that the kinkcough ever had its primary ſeat in this member of the body?</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0218200600:23"/>
            <p>Vomits being more ſerviceable, when they render the body ſoluble, only ſeems to prove, that the diſeaſe is not confined to the ſtomach; and if it be true, that ſuch patients bear the action of vomits better than purges, the only concluſion that can be drawn is, that purges weaken by making a general drain from the whole body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as vomits do not cauſe ſo great an evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Nor is the king's evil, and rickets, being the conſequence of <hi>an obſtinate</hi> kinkcough, any more to your purpoſe. You acknowledge the king's-evil to have its ſeat in the conglobate glands; and ſuppoſing, (though it is far from being certain) that thoſe of the meſentery are firſt affected, yet this is no clear proof in your favour, this diſeaſe being in another bowel. And can the kink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough <hi>ſimply conſidered,</hi> any more produce the king's-evil, than the king's-evil the kinkcough? The rickets have followed the ſmall-pox, which you ſay is a diſeaſe of the ſtomach; and any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order at a certain period in life, that greatly weakens and relaxes the fibres of children, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to the rickets, will bring them on. You confeſs, that both theſe diſorders are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the kinkcough's continuing a long time, and to the inteſtines thereby loſing their contractile power. And we alſo think, as theſe diſorders never follow the kinkcough, till it has long continued, that they are brought on by its obſtinacy cauſing a general weakneſs and relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in habits previouſly diſpoſed to theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0218200600:24"/>and not to its primary ſeat being in the inteſtines.</p>
            <p>But ſurely you are much miſtaken about your fourth, and what you think your moſt powerful argument, p. 25. For if we are to conclude from the periodical returns, that the kinkcough and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fevers have both their ſeat in the ſame place, you prove that inſtead of the inteſtines, the kinkcough may have its primary ſeat in the eyes, or in one of the teeth, becauſe you have given us a clear inſtance of an intermittent thus ſituated; for the black ſtools we imagine were owing to their being tinctured with extract of bark; and we ſhould have received equal information about the nature of the diſeaſe, if we had been told that the patient had black ſtools after eating bilberries. If you did not think the ſeat of this intermittent to be in the tooth, why did you direct it to be drawn? and are not local intermittents common? We believe that intermitting fevers have often their ſeat in the abdomen, yet we think the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their proximate cauſe being in the liver, meſentery, &amp;c. more probable than that it lodges ſolely in the guts; nor do your two caſes prove the contrary. You have before ſaid, p. 23. that an enlarged belly and colic are the ſymptoms of obſtructed glands in the meſentery; and might not the pain in the firſt boy's belly, p. 26. ariſe from a ſimilar cauſe, and the cure chiefly to be owing to the fomentation removing the obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe his colic was cured before the worms were entirely eradicated? Might not the cure of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0218200600:25"/>the ſecond boy be accompliſhed by the purges producing the ſame effect; and would the belly have been large <hi>and hard,</hi> if the inteſtines only had been diſeaſed?</p>
            <p>In regard to the inteſtines being the moſt likely place for generating an infectious diſeaſe, we muſt obſerve, that however plauſible the arguments in favour of this opinion may appear, they are very far from being concluſive; and though the dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and putrid fever, &amp;c. ſpread by contagion, yet it is not a clear point, that the miaſmata bring on the ſucceeding diſeaſe by firſt affecting the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary canal. The viperine poiſon, though deadly when infuſed into a wound, taken by the mouth produces no bad effect; nor will the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolous matter create a diſeaſe ſwallowed in the ſame manner, provided in its paſſage it touches not an excoriated part, though even a ſingle atom is fully ſufficient for the purpoſe when the cuticle is removed, and it comes in contact with the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent veſſels, ſeated on the ſurface of the body. A poor lad had a large tumour in his mouth, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the upper jaw, which was very foul, and from which a large quantity of very offenſive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid matter was ſwallowed in the night-time, when he was aſleep. It purged him gently, and, at the end of three weeks or a month, his blood ſeemed to be diſſolved by the vibices which appeared in the ſkin; yet he never had the leaſt fever, though he lived at leaſt ſix or eight weeks, and at laſt died of extreme weakneſs; whereas, had the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of matter been abſorbed from an ulcer, a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquative
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0218200600:26"/>fever would ſoon have been the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. From all which we would infer, that the juices in the primae viae correct and reader leſs active infectious matter; and that this does not ſeem to be the only way by which infection is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. The opinion that the miaſms which propagate infection, enter the habit by the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatics in the lungs, and other abſorbents, ſeems more likely to be true; for in this way, by ſuch time as the diſeaſe makes its appearance<note n="*" place="bottom">When we inoculate for the ſmall-pox, it is evident that the variolous matter enters the inteſtines before any fever comes on, by its deſtroying worms. See the following eſſay.</note>, they will in all probability have contaminated the bile, and the variety of humours blended in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines.</p>
            <p>But to return to the reſemblance betwixt the kinkcough and intermitting fevers, which ſeem to ariſe from an accumulation and diſcharge of phlegm; for when the ſtomach is unloaded by coughing and vomiting, the patient becomes eaſy till a freſh quantity of phlegm is collected in the ſtomach ſufficient to excite another fit of cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which, ſurely, notwithſtanding your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrary, is a full proof, that this bowel is immediately affected, and that unloading it is the cauſe of the intermiſſion. You indeed think differently; but may we not ſuppoſe, that in intermitting fevers obſcure intermiſſions are rendered diſtinct, by thoſe medicines which remove the offending cauſe from the affected part? And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0218200600:27"/>why then are we not to believe a diſorder, that has periodical returns, to be ſeated in the ſtomach, becauſe vomiting affords relief?—Why truly, ſay you, <q>"It would ſeem that the interfering cauſe, a foulneſs of ſtomach, being thus removed, the pure inteſtinal ſymptom of intermiſſion becomes evident and diſtinct:"</q> which is a moſt futile argument, becauſe you have not in one inſtance proved, that intermittents are ſeated in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; and we may therefore conclude, that WALDSCHMID, when he ſaid this cough proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſtomach, was guided by common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, which you, ſir, have deſerted; and through the whole of this chapter have had recourſe to mere conjecture and hypotheſis.</p>

            <p>How full and true your deſcription of the kink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough is, we have already obſerved, and ſhall farther make appear; and how far your obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have eſtabliſhed the true ſeat of the diſeaſe, let every man judge. However, you have given us a clear inſtance, that you remember what you learnt at lecture, in ſo very learnedly explaining what is the prediſpoſing, and what the proximate cauſe of a diſeaſe; and to be ſure it required a maſterly hand to point out that a diſeaſe is preſent, while its cauſe is preſent: but we do inſiſt upon it, that a diſeaſe often remains after its proximate cauſe is removed. But wonderful information
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0218200600:28"/>muſt accrue to the public from their now being ſhewn the neceſſity and uſe of being acquainted with the cauſe of a diſeaſe; we may add, when it can be accomplished; <q>"but ſo great are the difficulties of tracing out the hidden cauſes of the evils to which this frame of ours is ſubject, that the moſt candid of the profeſſion have ever allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lamented how unavoidably they are in the dark;"</q> and the abortiveneſs of your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in this reſpect, is one clear proof how juſtly they have reaſoned.</p>
            <p>Few or none will think with you in regard to the kinkcough being peculiar to childhood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſometimes ſeizes grown people; and it may with truth be affirmed, that the ſtory about the irritability of children, both in health and when diſeaſed, has been long known and applied; and certain it is, that this diſorder more commonly affects children, without being preceded by any other diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <q>"an enumeration of the effects of the ſpecific miaſms, which produce the kink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough, will ſufficiently point out their true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;"</q> but not ſuch a perplexed enumeration as you have given us. In one place you aſſert, p. 51. that they act upon the nervous powers, and increaſe the irritability of the ſyſtem, a few lines after, <q>"that as far as your ſenſes can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, they act chiefly on the mucus;"</q> and then again, a few lines below, you ſay, <q>"it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the kinkcough anſwers to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peſtilential diſorders, &amp;c. ſince its
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0218200600:29"/>miaſms are contagious, and act chiefly on the nerves;"</q> and laſtly, after this confuſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <q>"you hope you have ſufficiently cleared up the nature of the contagious particles."</q> But in what manner? For do not miaſms, as different in their <hi>nature</hi> as poſſible, act upon the nervous power, and increaſe the irritability of the ſyſtem, of which the miaſms producing the ſmall-pox, meaſles, &amp;c. are an inſtance? or why do they produce different diſeaſes? Suppoſe what you have ſaid to be true, it only proves that they have an irritating property, which is far from explor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>nature:</hi> but all theſe little miſtakes every conſiderate man will excuſe, when he reflects that you do not pretend to go deeper into this matter than the limits of your underſtanding will permit.</p>
            <p>But to have been conſiſtent with yourſelf, you ſhould have omitted enquiring into the origin of the contagious particles which give riſe to the kinkcough, as this is certainly wading out of your depth. Indeed in this inquiry you ſet out very aukwardly; for not having examined into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yourſelf, you are led into a miſtake by copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a former writer, in regard to our not having any very early account about this diſorder; for Hippocrates preſcribed <hi>ad taſſim pueri</hi>

Even when they reviſited Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes. According to your account they muſt eſcape from the guts, and we may readily ſuppoſe that ſome paſſenger carried a belly-full over, and letting fly as ſoon as he landed, infected the whole iſland. Indeed Dr. Hillary obſerves, that the hooping-cough appeared in Barbadoes in the month of July 1753, after a good deal of rain, often with thunder and lightning, though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate days were hot and dry; and he could not find upon the ſtricteſt enquiry, that any child or elder perſon brought it thither, which you may conclude is in favour of your doctrine; but you muſt be told, that fermentation deſtroys the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion of all bodies upon which it acts. That tough viſcid phlegm is always diſcharged in the firſt ſtage of the kinkcough; that there is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no fermentation in the caſe, and that the whole of what you have ſaid about creating dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious particles in the guts is of courſe chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and ſeems to be no better ſupported than the opinion that Spaniſh mares become pregnant by aſcending high mountains, and ſwallowing with open mouth the weſtern wind.</p>
            <p>If ſo, the remainder of what you have ſaid in this chapter, except its being ſometimes propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by contagion, falls to the ground, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no farther comment; though, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0218200600:31"/>I much admire your arguments againſt the removal of children in this diſorder; becauſe, if they were removed from Derby, and its environs, the writing of your book might not anſwer the end deſigned; and yet it may be difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the truth of the opinion, that pure air aſſiſts in recovering the patient. For, if <q>"the air under certain circumſtances is the primary cauſe of this diſorder,"</q> how comes it to paſs that the kinkcough does not depend upon the ſtate of the atmoſphere, like many epidemic diſeaſes? Will not an air capable of producing the kinkcough be a conſtant <hi>fomes morbi?</hi> and, conſequently, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the patient to a place where the air is pure muſt be rational at leaſt.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the hiſtory of hemlock, as a cure for the kinkcough.</head>
            <p>What you ſay, ſir, has been aſſerted about the cure of the kinkcough, may with equal truth be aſſerted of every diſorder known, as we have not <hi>a certain</hi> cure for any of them. Where there it a multiplicity of indications in diſeaſes (for methods of cure are not indications), it is impoſſible for them all to give way to ſpecific treatment; for various circumſtances will always require a combination of various remedies. Nor is the unſucceſsful treatment of the kinkcough the reaſon why Dr. Willis's obſervation, <q>"that old women are oftner conſulted in this diſorder than phyſicians,"</q> holds true in our own times; for people ſeldom apply to phyſicians, on account of the expence, as they do not apprehend danger, and they know the diſeaſe will commonly get well of itſelf in time. Nevertheleſs, if you can make people believe that we have as yet no certain and effectual cure for the kinkcough, nor any one medicine that ought to be uſed in many caſes that occur, that every method hitherto followed is at beſt but a palliative, and that hemlock is a ſpecific in every caſe that can happen, your buſineſs is done.</p>
            <p>But whether your being convinced that the diſeaſe is ſpaſmodic, and that hemlock is one of the beſt antiſpaſmodics, will aſſiſt in recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the notice of practitioners in medicine,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0218200600:33"/>may be much doubted; becauſe, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, what you have ſaid tends to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade other people, that the diſeaſe is not ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic, but a morbid alteration of the inteſtinal contents; and it will eaſily be diſcovered whether medicines that clear the <hi>primae viae,</hi> and leſſen irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, or a medicine which acts as an antiſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic only, are moſt likely to prove palliatives.</p>
            <p>However, though your reaſoning may have perplexed this matter, and though you may be miſtaken about the nature and the ſeat of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in queſtion, yet it does not follow that you have not found out a remedy that will cure it, the uſe of medicine being often diſcovered by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The Indian who diſcovered that the bark would cure an intermitting fever, knew nothing probably of the nature of the diſeaſe; and <hi>as you have confined your practice in almoſt all diſeaſes to the uſe of hemlock,</hi> you may by chance have found out a cure for the kinkcough, and we muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſee whether the evidence you produce will ſupuort the character you give it.</p>
            <p>A ſpecific ſhould be able to cure the diſeaſe to which it is appropriated without any aſſiſtance; and, in order to have a clear proof of the efficacy of any medicine, it ſhould be given ſimply and alone; and it is therefore impoſſible to ſay how far hemlock, and how far the other remedies might contribute to the cure in your firſt and fifth caſes. Cantharides have always been found of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in the hooping-cough, whether taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or outwardly applied; nor have purging
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0218200600:34"/>medicines, eſpecially emetic tartar, &amp;c. by clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>primae viae,</hi> been found leſs ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>Who can, therefore, ſay in Mrs. Hodgkinſon's caſe, that the bliſter and emetic tartar did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate and remove the viſcid phlegm, which was manifeſtly the cauſe of the cough? Hemlock might then be ſerviceable, by acting as an opiate, and allaying that increaſed irritability, which the cauſe of every cough in a greater or leſs degree produces, and which often will occaſion frequent coughing for ſome time after the primary diſeaſe is removed.</p>
            <p>A. B. was better from the application of the firſt bliſter, and the effects of his purging mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which brought away ſlime, before hemlock was given. Lancing the gum too would leſſen the increaſed irritability of the whole habit, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſecond operation, which let out three teeth at once, and yet the hemlock was conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given: we find he coughed a good deal till a ſecond bliſter was applied, <hi>and then</hi> the fits were much milder, and returned ſcarcely once in two hours. Beſides, the bowels were unloaded of ſlime <hi>daily,</hi> either with ſyrup of roſes or manna; he was vomited with oxymel of ſquills, which rendered his breathing free; and after five weeks and four days had elapſed, in which time ſix teeth were bred, (and I ſuppoſe came to light) the patient was well. And it may be aſked, with what pretenſions could it be ſaid in the third corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, that <q>"that hemlock certainly prevented ſpaſms, and probably convulſions, in this child?"</q>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0218200600:35"/>Muſt not there be a ſtrange partiality in favour of hemlock to make ſuch a concluſion; and will not corollaries thus drawn lead to error?</p>
            <p>But to go back to your writing to your friend in Scotland, p. 63. we may obſerve, that it was unlucky that the children were got well before your letter of advice arrived, otherwiſe hemlock might have got the whole credit of the cure; and, though this anecdote does not throw great light upon the ſubject, yet perhaps it may foreſtall any claim a pretender may make to hints given; and you will thereby avoid that cenſure you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore experienced<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Reviews.</note>, in publiſhing as your own a method of curing the ſtone by injection, when the hint came from Dr. Whytt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond caſe not being inſiſted on as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I paſs it over; and the third does not ſeem much to your purpoſe, becauſe hemlock was not given by itſelf; and who will be hardy enough to ſay, that lemon juice, ſalt of tartar, and ſyrup of ſugar, did not alter the properties of this remedy? and that the good effects were not produced by the manna, and a medicine very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from hemlock when given alone? But the complete recovery ſeems to have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as often happens in this diſeaſe, by time, as nine or ten weeks elapſed before the patient was in perfect health.</p>
            <p>Indeed, you inform us, that ſhe was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner well in a much ſhorter time; but this we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0218200600:36"/>imagine was nothing more than the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the cough, which always happens after a certain period.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <q>"a fever is not eſſential to the kink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough;"</q> but in the cough following the meaſles, a fever, with a white tongue, quick pulſe, and ſediment in the urine, is a common attendant: and are not this fever and cough fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently increaſed and renewed by eating things of hard digeſtion, or upon taking a ſlight cold? whence there is reaſon to imagine, that a great part of this child's illneſs was owing to acrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remaining after the meaſles, upon, and irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lungs. It is common for ſaline medicines, without the aſſiſtance of hemlock, to make the phlegm looſer in the cough thus produced; and this hectic fever and cough have often been cured by the ſame remedies, and gentle purging, in a ſhort ſpace of time: ſo that, upon the whole, you may ſee this is not ſo clear a caſe in your favour as you have imagined.</p>
            <p>The fourth caſe too, communicated to you by Mr. Smith, is liable to the ſame objections, as not hemlock alone, but a medicine of a very different nature was given; and from a ſerious peruſal of the firſt five caſes, the reader will judge, whether you had any good reaſon to be <hi>perfectly</hi> convinced that you had diſcovered <q>"an agreeable, certain, and expeditious cure for the kinkcough:"</q> when, not having patients enow of your own, you wrote to Mr. Yorke to furniſh you with ſome for your purpoſe.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0218200600:37"/>
            <p>But the firſt of theſe caſes will do you very little ſervice; for, upon enquiry, the child did not take the medicine except a few days. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not dreading the event of the diſorder, did not chuſe to give it her by force, though it was regularly brought every evening about ſix o'clock, to be taken next day, but it was conſtantly thrown away. The mother ſays <q>"the ſmell of the <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucks</hi> ſcented the whole houſe, and was ſo very diſagreeable, that the child could not bear it; and, ſhe believes, it would have thrown her daughter into fits if ſhe had perſiſted in the uſe of this medicine."</q> She, therefore, bought manna<note n="*" place="bottom">The mother ſays, <q>"thoſe days ſhe was purged with manna ſhe was much better than when ſhe took the humlucks."</q>
               </note> at different places, with which ſhe kept her bowels open, and the diſorder terminated, as often happens, in the ſpace of ſix weeks.</p>
            <p>It is very common for the lower claſs of people to omit taking medicines, even when they are to pay for them, becauſe they are unpalatable; and, I have ſo often diſcovered, that the medicines during a whole illneſs have been ſecreted, and not taken, that I am very cautious in aſcribing effects to them, unleſs I am very certain they have been given. The parents of theſe children had not thought of calling in any aſſiſtance, but were ſent to, and deſired to make trial of ſome medicine that ſhould be given them; and common civility obliged them not to refuſe the offer; but when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that giving medicines to children is always
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0218200600:38"/>troubleſome, and requires great reſolution to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh; that the common people do not look upon this diſorder as dangerous, and that they have no doubt of it in general going off of its own accord, it is reaſonable to imagine, that they would not be equally vigorous with the preſcriber in purſuing his method of cure, otherwiſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of HELE<note n="*" place="bottom">See Treatiſe on the Kinkcough, p. 159.</note> would not have diſuſed the bark ſhift which was given her; and, in my opinion, I think none of theſe caſes are to be depended upon, where either the preſcriber or apothecary did not ſee the medicines given. However, ſuppoſing them to be taken, the caſe of ELIZABETH and JOHN PAGE are exceptionable, becauſe lemon-juice and ſalt of tartar were joined with hemlock; beſides, ELIZABETH PAGE had the diſorder from firſt to laſt near ſeven weeks; and does not it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten terminate of itſelf in this time? We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that JOHN PAGE had the diſorder very ſlightly, otherwiſe he would have kinked oftener than twice in the night.</p>
            <p>Mary Green was not cured.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith, for all that we know, joined juice of lemon and ſalt of tartar with hemlock, in the manner he had before done; and his caſes, as they at preſent ſtand, are therefore no evidence.</p>
            <p>Thomas Newdale, who had the diſorder near ſeven weeks, had ſal polychreſt and magneſia given to aſſiſt the cure.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0218200600:39"/>
            <p>Magneſia and ſal polychreſt were alſo given in MARY HELE'S caſe, but ſhe had no permanent relief till ſhe wore a bark ſhift; and after taking hemlock a month, a violent diarrhea, with puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtools ſtreaked with blood, and a teneſmus came on, and ſhe was very reſtleſs, and vomited up her food; <hi>but, upon the hemlock mixture being omitted,</hi> and three drops of laudanum being given, and repeated every night and morning, her looſeneſs was abated and cured, ſhe had good nights, and <hi>her cough, which the hemlock could not ſubdue,</hi> was intirely removed; and, we are told, ſhe got well: but of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>WILLIAM TOPLIS had a variety of medicines joined to hemlock, notwithſtanding which he died, though, it is ſaid, his kinkcough was cured a few days before his death, and at a time when he appears to have been very ill; but in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Eſſay we ſhall have occaſion to take notice of hemlock, and we ſhall then review this caſe.</p>
            <p>Mary Langley had the diſorder in all ſeven weeks, and magneſia and nitre were joined with hemlock; and, upon the whole we may obſerve, that there are only ſeven caſes out of the twenty, in which hemlock can poſſibly have all the credit of the cure, becauſe other medicines were joined along with it; and if it was imagined they would give no aſſiſtance, why were they preſcribed? And even in all theſe ſeven caſes, will not the ſugar of ſugar-candy rob the hemlock of its honour and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0218200600:40"/>glory, becauſe ſugar, vegetable juice, and water will ferment? I know that this hemlock mixture will, in a few hours become ropy, and afterwards a fermentation enſues, and it becomes vinous; and, though it may, like cowſlip wine, retain ſomething of its narcotic quality, yet it will be greatly altered. Perhaps it may be ſaid, that the mixture being to be taken in the ſpace of twenty-four hours, it has not time to ferment; but in the heat of May and June, when theſe children were ill, every body knows that this alteration will take place in a very few hours. Beſides, ANNE ARCHER and ROBERT TRUSSEL were ill five weeks.</p>
            <p>SAMUEL ARCHER one month.</p>
            <p>ANCOR SARAH WADDLE and ELIZABETH TRUSSEL about two months. And you yourſelf are ſo well ſatisfied that theſe caſes are not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, that you think it neceſſary to explain ſome circumſtances in ſome of them:</p>
            <p>We join you in opinion, p. 157, that the fifth caſe may be as remarkable as any of the reſt, and yet not very remarkable in favour of hemlock. Any man muſt be ſtrangely biaſſed in favour of this medicine, who could conclude, when ſo many other medicines had given relief, that it ſaved this patient's life; and from what has been ſaid, it is plain you were miſtaken in aſcribing the cure <hi>of all</hi> the ſix patients to hemlock. But you ſeem to be eaſily convinced, otherwiſe you would not have attempted to perſuade others it was effectual where the diſeaſe was not cured; for you have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0218200600:41"/>artfully numbered Mary Green among thoſe made well by this remedy, though her caſe proves the contrary; and her mother ſays, ſhe did not get well of at leaſt ſix months after ſhe had quite done taking this medicine. You ſay, <q>"I ſaw all the four patients cured by Mr. Yorke (Mary Green being one of them), and ſome of them before they were well; and I enquired very minutely into their ſeveral ſymptoms, and this was only that I might have every poſſible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for facts, which I deſired to deliver to the world with the utmoſt conſciouſneſs of their reality."</q> Surely this is ſtraining a point, to ſay no worſe of it, to give credit to hemlock; and how are we to believe you, when you thus ſolemnly attempt to impoſe upon us?</p>
            <p>Curing Thomas Newdale twice in a fortnight was really extravagant; once well done would have been quite ſufficient, as the diſorder ſeizes a perſon but once in his life. But notwithſtanding what may have been ſaid to the contrary, (ſee caſe 17) HELE does not ſeem to have been cured once. Poor child! She indeed ſuffered much hardſhip, ſeemingly from being trifled with, when the uſe of the bark was ſo early indicated<note n="*" place="bottom">You knew an ague had been cured by the bark when complicated with the kinkcough, (ſee Treat. Kink. p. 172.) why then was the uſe of this medicine deferred near ſeven weeks? and was not giving hemlock in this inſtance experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment making? becauſe an <hi>approved remedy</hi> was at hand. See Home Princip. Med. p. 122.</note>, and if this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy had been ſooner given, ſhe now probably
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0218200600:42"/>might have been numbered among the living in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the dead, as her conſtitution might not have been ruined, and ſhe might have been able to bear a blaſt of wind. But you were conſiſtent with yourſelf in adhering to your opinion, that hemlock does not only cure the kinkcough, but the ague alſo; and the conſequence was, that ſhe together with TOPLIS are in heaven; and, it may be inſiſted on, that hemlock did good ſervice in theſe inſtances, by ſtanding in the place of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedies, and ſuffering the diſorder to carry theſe infants into happineſs.</p>
            <p>You ſee, ſir, how willing I am to help you out at a dead lift; and in the Eſſay annexed, the looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which probably aſſiſted in carrying HELE to her grave, will be accounted for, without having recourſe to conjecture, and the neceſſity of killing and deſtroying worms for the purpoſe; though I admire your ingenious theory of theſe vermin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged by uncommon heat to ſeek their way out of the body by a voluntary effort, in the ſame manner. I ſuppoſe, as people make a voluntary effort to get out of a window, or a back door, when a houſe is on fire. But there is another way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining this matter; and the reader will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge whether it ought not to have been known to one who is a fellow of a royal college of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.</p>
            <p>But after all, I find you have been endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make us give credit to what you yourſelf do not believe; for, if you had been perfectly convinced, that in hemlock you had diſcovered a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0218200600:43"/>certain and expeditious cure for the kinkcough, you would not in the laſt caſe but one, <q>"have been perpetually wavering between the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a great name, and the ſuggeſtion of your own reaſon and experience."</q> From this declaration it is evident, you wanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conviction from plain proof; for a man muſt be an errant fool indeed, who gives up a plain matter of fact, of which he is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, to the influence of any name how great ſoever. And we aſk the opinion of thoſe uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this matter, whether they think you were perfectly convinced or not?</p>
            <p>Your laying the death of HELE to the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of her parents, and excuſing the want of ſpeedy ſucceſs to a ſmoaky houſe, &amp;c. in TOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS'S, LANGLEY'S<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a curious excuſe, it being confeſſed, that they were not confined within doors, p. 161.</note>, and WADLEY'S caſes, will avail but little in favour of your remedy, when it is called to mind, that you have long inſenſibly fallen into this way of excuſing yourſelf by the moſt trifling evaſions, when, having promiſed a recovery, death, by victory, has ſhewn the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weapons by which you endeavoured to keep him at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>From the whole it muſt appear to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed reader, that hemlock has not always been ſucceſsful in the kinkcough; that other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines were required, both when it was ſimple and when the diſeaſe was complicated, and that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0218200600:44"/>you have ſaid more in the praiſe of this remedy than is true.</p>

But we will aſk the advice of thoſe ſkilled in medicine, whether, notwithſtanding the idle theory about the hemlock removing clotty feculent accumulations lurking in the guts, either it or opium can be given with ſafety, without previous evacuations, or purging medicines joined along with them?

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE HOOPING-COUGH.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER has a mind to ſee what has been ſaid by former writers upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a few of the ancients excepted, may con-Dr. MILLAR's late obſervations on the hooping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough, where they will find that phyſicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the days of Dr. B—, had employed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully ſome of their thoughts on the nature and cure of this diſorder; and the following ſhort Eſſay is intended to ſhew whether the method and medicines they recommend, or that adviſed by Dr. B—, is moſt likely to relieve the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, we will begin by taking an abſtract from notes made in 1749, when the hooping-cough prevailed in this place and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; and we chuſe to relate the ſymptoms
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0218200600:50"/>attending thoſe children where the diſorder took its courſe without help from medicine, as from hence we ſhall learn its regular progreſs, and theſe we had many opportunities of ſeeing, as the common people knowing that the diſorder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wears off of itſelf in time, were not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about medical aſſiſtance, but relied on ſuch trifling remedies as themſelves thought moſt proper.</p>
            <p>Early in the ſpring, which was moiſt and very cold, many children in the ſpace of four or five miles round this place were ſeized with the hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-cough, about the ſame time, which firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with a little dry cough, and ſometimes the ſame kind of indiſpoſition as accompanies taking cold, but ſoon after ropy phlegm was coughed up. After this the lungs and ſtomach were daily loaded with a larger quantity of phlegm, which in ſome became immoderate.</p>
            <p>After ſome, or all of this phlegm was diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a fit of coughing and vomiting, the child became eaſy till a ſufficient quantity was again ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated to excite another fit of coughing, &amp;c. during which, ſtrong children often bled at the noſe, and were black in the face: the phlegm diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged was ſometimes ſtreaked with blood, and the countenance in a little while acquired a luco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmatic appearance.</p>
            <p>Thoſe children who had ſenſe enough to ſpit out the phlegm at the time of coughing, got ſafely over the diſorder; ſometimes, where it was not very troubleſome, in about ſix weeks; where more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0218200600:51"/>violent, in about two months, and ſometimes it was three months, or longer, before it terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But ſome younger children fared not ſo well, for inſtead of throwing the phlegm out of their mouth they ſwallowed it; a griping and looſe ſtools followed, and all the parts about the anus were excoriated. At this time they became dry, had a quick ſmall pulſe, and all the other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms accompanying a fever. They now daily got weaker, their legs and body became more or leſs oedematous, the cough gradually ceaſed, the difficulty of breathing became more urgent, ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. came on; and when the parents thought their children getting better, death convinced them of their miſtake, by cloſing the ſcene with all the ſymptoms of a <hi>ſpurious peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the progreſs of this diſeaſe it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in different parts of the neighbourhood, that the cough was better for two or three days<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>"It is worthy of remark, that the convulſive cough in Edinburgh, after being milder in January 1735, ſuddenly became much worſe in the firſt week in February, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo the greater part of that month, gradually decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards as the ſpring and ſummer advanced." <bibl>Ed. Med. Eſſ. vol. iv.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>, and then returned again with its uſual violence, but towards the latter part of ſummer it wholly diſappeared.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſymptoms give us every reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, with other writers, that the diſorder is cauſed by ſome morbid diſpoſition of the air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0218200600:52"/>not only one, but many children ſeveral miles aſunder were ſeized nearly at the ſame time. Nor can we account for the ſudden abatement and return of the cough, but from ſudden alterations in this element. Perhaps it becomes replete with miaſma, which render the ſerous and lymphatic juices acrid; whence a larger quantity of them than ordinary is ſecreted in conſequence of their irritating the veſſels which ſecrete them; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the air may have the power of weakening the muſcular fibres, and of rendering the fluids viſcid and ropy. But Dr. B— ſays, miaſms irritate the mucous glands alone, and cauſe a greater ſecretion of viſcous matter.</p>
            <p>In ſupport of the firſt of theſe opinions, it may be ſaid, that whenever the ſerous or lymphatic juices are extravaſated, and depoſited in any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in the body, they become viſcid and ropy, witneſs the lymph which ſtagnates in the noſe; and why, therefore, will not lymph become ropy in the ſame manner, when a greater quantity than ordinary is depoſited upon the lungs in the ſtomach and in the inteſtines?</p>
            <p>In ſupport of the ſecond opinion, it may be ſaid, that we know a particular ſtate of the air under a lax habit, and ſuch are children, will render the lymph ropy, witneſs the ſpurious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumony which children we ſee in this diſorder fall into when the offending matter is not expelled in coughing. And in favour of both theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions it may be ſaid, the diſeaſe is not confined to the lungs, or to the alimentary canal, but that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0218200600:53"/>it is extended to the whole body; the fibres in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being relaxed, and an oedematous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance evinces, that the lymph in general has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a pituitous diſpoſition<note n="*" place="bottom">Some writers have aſſerted, that the juices never acquire this diſpoſition; they ſhould have added while they were circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in the veſſels; for upon diſſecting an oedematous leg, I found the fluids which had ſtagnated in the cellular membrane gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y and reſembling the white of an egg.</note>; and, beſides, it does not appear that mucus but thickened lymph is diſcharged.</p>
            <p>In ſupport of the laſt opinion, nothing can be ſaid till we are certain that it is mucus alone which is diſcharged in the fit of coughing, and then there could be no doubt but in this diſeaſe the mucous glands are chiefly firſt affected. Theſe different opinions we mention to ſhew what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty there is in fixing the manner in which the immediate cauſe of this diſorder acts, and what parts of the body are firſt affected; and, therefore, all the plain truth we can collect is, that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a particular ſtate in the air, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and lungs are loaded with a tough viſcid phlegm, and that there is a weakneſs and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to relaxation in the fibres, and to a ropy diſpoſition of the lymph and ſerum; that an affection of the ſtomach and lungs is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of the cough, becauſe the patient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately becomes eaſy by vomiting and expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>That the lungs and ſtomach are chiefly, and more immediately affected in the firſt ſtage of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0218200600:54"/>diſeaſe than the inteſtines, ſeems to be plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the phlegm does not wholly paſs off by ſtool, but is diſcharged by the mouth. Beſides, when it is not evacuated upwards, a new train of ſymptoms will ariſe; for accumulating in the ſtomach, it paſſes into the inteſtines, putrifies, and becomes very acrid; and the queſtion is, whether if the inteſtines were the primary ſeat of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, this putrefaction and a conſequent diarrhaea would not always take place, and whether the phlegm would not all paſs downward inſtead of upward? Whereas the truth is, unload the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and lungs as of ten as an accumulation of viſcid phlegm takes place, and the bowels will not ſeem to be much affected.</p>
            <p>However, it is not matter of much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in practice, whether phlegm firſt reſides in the ſtomach or inteſtines, as the whole ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary canal from its connection muſt be more or leſs affected with phlegm <hi>during</hi> the progreſs of the diſeaſe; and ſeeing that the patient becomes eaſy upon its being diſcharged, and that a general weakneſs and viſcidity prevails, the true intentions of the cure muſt be, to clear repeatedly the lungs and <hi>prime viae,</hi> to attenuate viſcid phlegm, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate the blood, and to preſerve the ſtrength of the ſolids; and, by taking a view of preceding writers, we ſhall find, that the medicines which have anſwered theſe ends, have been found moſt ſerviceable in curing this diſorder<note n="*" place="bottom">If this hereafter appears to be true, thoſe who inſiſt on hemlock's being a ſpecific, becauſe it is antiſpaſmodic, do not ſeem to have ſeen this matter in its true light.</note>.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0218200600:55"/>
            <p>Vomits and purges, and medicines which both vomit and purge, have been recommended as principal remedies; and can there be any doubt of theſe medicines relieving the patient, as they take away the immediate cauſe of the cough? General conſent evinces, that bliſters, or cantharides taken inwardly, have here been remarkably ſerviceable; and the cure of the hooping-cough, by inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſmall-pox, alſo ſhew that attenuants are proper aſſiſtants in the cure. And do not all agree, that the bark is in this caſe a moſt uſeful medicine?</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, particular ſymptoms require far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance, till theſe medicines have had time to act upon and remove the diſeaſe itſelf, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of which is the COUGH; and this Dr. B— has, with great deliberation, declared to be ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and ſpaſmodic. We ſhall, therefore, for the information of this gentleman, obſerve, that there is an increaſed degree of irritability in the nerves in every cough, though but of ſhort ſtanding; that all coughs are brought on by the nerves of particular parts being irritated; and that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, a ſpaſm of the diaphragm, and other muſcles ſubſervient to reſpiration, follow to ſhake off and expel the irritating matter, by an increaſed force of the air which paſſes out of the lungs in reſpiration<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe who have read Hoffman, &amp;c. are well acquainted with this doctrine; but they will pleaſe to remember, that I am not attempting to inſtruct thoſe who have enquired properly into the nature of coughs.</note>. So that every cough is a convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0218200600:56"/>cough, and only differs from the hooping-cough in its degree of violence; for, though in this laſt there is a vomiting and coughing mixed, yet when we reflect upon the action of coughing, and the parts concerned, we ſhall diſcover it to be a minor vomiting, and that of courſe a deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and greater force in coughing will enſue, when the cauſe is ſeated in the ſtomach than when it only reſides about the lungs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, there is a difference in the nature of the cauſe of coughs, ſome being entirely the conſequence of irritated matter, while others ariſe from a diſeaſe in the nerves themſelves, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſo very irritable that a fit of coughing comes on from any ſlight accident that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to effect the nerves of the lungs<note n="*" place="bottom">This kind of cough is cured by removing the cauſe of the diſeaſe in the nerves, and by medicines which have a power of taking off increaſed irritability, ſuch as myrrh, gum ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum, opium, camphire, bark, and the like.</note>; but the cough of which we are now treating, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to ariſe from the former of theſe cauſes. Nor could it ever be cured by irritating medicines if it was entirely nervous; and we ſhall, therefore, proceed to obſerve, that every cough is an effort of nature to expel the irritating matter, and though, when violent, it may always be mitigated with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and advantage, yet wherever it is accompanied with an accumulation of phlegm, or the like, it ought never to be ſuppreſſed intirely, unleſs we can alſo at the ſame time remove this preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural flux. <q>"Opiates rather did hurt in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0218200600:57"/>hooping-cough which raged at Edinburgh in 1734,"</q> probably becauſe they were given in the uſual dole, and cauſed a retention of that phlegm which would have been diſcharged, if the coughing had not been much ſuppreſſed. Poor TOPLISS<note n="*" place="bottom">See caſe xviii. p. 131.</note> had his cough ſuppreſſed by hemlock, which is an opiate; and he died of his other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, in ſame manner probably as thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren we have taken notice of, where the cough was ſuppreſſed by weakneſs <hi>and an overload of phlegm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, when we give only one, two, of three drops of laudanum in a day, without entirely ſuppreſſing the cough, it ſufficiently leſſens the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritability of the whole habit, and gives the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient relief, by preventing the nerves from being ſo violently affected. Dr. Hillary ſays, <q>"a little ſyr. mecon. or elix. paregoric."</q> (joined with other medicines), ſeldom fails to render the diſeaſe more moderate, and in time takes it off: and the only deficiency I can ſee in the practice of phyſicians in general is, that they have omitted to join <hi>very ſmall doſes</hi> of opium along with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines they have given to remove the cauſe of the diſeaſe. Whereas Dr. B— gives an opiate joined to purges; for we ſhall preſently ſhew, that hemlock, by his manner of mixing it, may be converted into a purge; and when this does not happen, he joins other purges along with it, ſo that while he is crying up hemlock as a ſpecific,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0218200600:58"/>he is in a great meaſure carrying off the diſeaſe by medicines recommended by former writers.</p>
            <p>We have already obſerved the neceſſity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>primae viae</hi> and lungs clear of phlegm, and this we are not to expect from hemlock, unleſs by accident, for though it ſometimes purges, <q>"yet it often does not ſenſibly affect any ſecretion;"</q> and, therefore, is not in this caſe to be ſolely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon. When it is juſt mixed with ſugar and water, or given in extract or powder, it, like other opiates, ſtops immediate ſecretion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes ſweat; but when the hemlock mixture has ſtood till it ferments, it opens the bowels in the ſame manner as ſugar-candy and the juice of penny-royal when they have ſtood together ſome time, ſo that this purgative quality is not inherent in hemlock, but ariſes from its being in a ſtate of fermentation; nor does it any way appear that it has an attenuating property, or that it is capable of invigorating the blood and ſolids, or of unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lungs when they are overcharged with phlegm; whence, though hemlock like opium may ſuppreſs the cough and vomiting, yet the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> is long in terminating under its uſe<note n="*" place="bottom">The patients would probably have been well in the ſame time if they had not taken any medicines at all.</note>, becauſe it is deſtitute of other properties which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to complete a cure. Peripneumonic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, bleeding at the noſe and eyes, and the phlegm being ſtreaked with blood, are ſurely ſymptoms which ſometimes require the uſe of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0218200600:59"/>lancet, admitting it to protract the diſeaſe, for as hemlock, by Dr. B—'s own account, is a week at leaſt in making a cure, may not in this time a rupture of a veſſel in the lungs or brain happen, and deſtroy the patient? It is confeſſed, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental bleedings have ſometimes done good; and is it not amazing, that a man who has ſeen pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumonic ſymptoms complicated with the hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-cough) ſhould in all caſes truſt the life of the patient entirely to a favourite antiſpaſmodic?</p>
            <p>It muſt evidently appear from what has been ſaid, that various remedies will here ever be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and as an opiate of ſome kind or other will in this cough always be a uſeful ingredient, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for us to enquire, whether ſmall doſes of laudanum or hemlock ought to have the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For this purpoſe we will relate a caſe or two, which have fallen under our own inſpection, and the reader himſelf may judge which is the ſafeſt and beſt remedy to cure the cough by leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irritability.</p>
            <p>A gentlewoman having an incurable ſchirrus, took, by the advice of two eminent phyſicians, ſeven grains of hemlock twice a day, which in a little time brought on an itching of the whole body. This was ſucceeded by innumerable ſmall bliſters, attended by a very angry kind of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, pain, and ſoreneſs; but upon leaving off this medicine theſe ſymptoms entirely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>Another lady took fourteen grains of the leaves of hemlock made into a powder twice a day, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0218200600:60"/>a poultice of the ſame herb was applied to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent tumour, occaſioned by milk ſtagnating in the upper part of her breaſt; the ſame kind of itching and bliſters we have mentioned followed accompanied by an inflammation reſembling a malignant eryſipelas, which ſwelled her more or leſs all over, but in particular her head; her eyes were affected; ſhe ſometimes complained of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo; the breaſt, upon which the poultice was laid, was ſpread over with fiery eruptions, and indeed her whole body ſeemed to be poiſoned. She was full of pain, had reſtleſs nights, and a fever; but upon leaving off this dangerous remedy, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper remedies, ſhe narrowly eſcaped death, and was reſtored to perfect health. I have ſeen other ſimilar caſes; but, perhaps it may be ſaid, it does not often produce theſe effects, which muſt be owing to ſome idioſyncraſy in theſe patients. Be it ſo; but may not this idioſyncraſy happen in a child, the darling of a tender mother; and would not a premature death thus brought on be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable<note n="*" place="bottom">Can this medicine then be given always with ſafety in pregnant women?</note>, when a drop or two of laudanum; or a few drops of the elixir paregoricum, will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eaſe the cough, by leſſening increaſed irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, without the leaſt degree of hazard or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience?</p>
            <p>Dr. BURTON, in order attenuate and diſſolve the phlegm, to corroborate and ſtrengthen the fibres, and to prevent any farther viſcidity, after
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0218200600:61"/>clearing the <hi>primae viae</hi> with oxymel of ſquills and deterſive purges, gave a medicine compoſed of <hi>cantharides, camphire,</hi> and <hi>extract of bark.</hi> 
               <q>"By this medicine," ſays he, "I performed the cures very ſoon, ſome in five or ſix days, as I can produce many vouchers to witneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. B— has only two to vouch for him, here are many.</note>; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Mr. Dent, apothecary in Selby, who has uſed it in the preſent epidemic chincough, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my preſcription;"</q> which is in a much ſhorter time than Dr. B—r pretends to have cured by his method; and I can eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what Dr. Burton ſays to be true, becauſe <hi>tincture of cantharides</hi> alone has cured this diſorder. Becauſe camphire, which the doctor added to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the cantharides, leſſens increaſed irritability; and becauſe I have ſeen bark and attenuants equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceſsful in a more advanced period. For my own part, I have in ſome meaſure followed Dr. Burton's method in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, except, that inſtead of cantharides I have choſen antimony as an attenuant, and I have given lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum in very ſmall doſes<note n="†" place="bottom">The rule is to give as much laudanum as will leſſen the cough without ſuppreſſing of it intirely; one drop I find it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly enough for the purpoſe, taken in the ſpace of twenty-four hours in a child of half a year old; two drops in one of a year old; three drops, two or three years old; four drops, four years old, &amp;c. but it is not neceſſary to continue increaſing the doſe according to the age of the patient, a leſs quantity, in proportion, being ſufficient, which is probably owing to the very irritable ſtate of young children.</note> for the purpoſe already mentioned.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0218200600:62"/>
            <p>If the child is plethoric and bleeds at the noſe, or if the phlegm diſcharged is ſtreaked with blood, I take ſome blood away from the arm to prevent any farther rupture of the veſſels. But I agree with Dr. Burton and others, that blood muſt be taken away with great caution; for, as we ſee this diſorder renders the fibres weak, and the juices ropy, ſo bleeding, by ſtill weakening them, will increaſe the complaint, and therefore, too large a diſcharge of blood will be greatly injurious. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much blood muſt be then taken away as is ſufficient to prevent a rupture of the veſſels, and this muſt be judged from the violence of the cough, together with the ſtrength of the patient.</p>
            <p>Where the ſtomach, &amp;c. are much loaded, I give a vomit of oxymel of ſquills, or rather ſome of the preparation of antimony; afterwards the child is purged gently every day with rhubarb and ſal polychreſt; and, at the ſame time, is taken three or four times a day, a doſe proportioned to the ſtrength and age of the patient, of a medicine compoſed of the bark decoction, eſſence of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſyrup of pennyroyal, and laudanum, which very ſoon leſſens, and ſhortly intirely removes the whole of this complaint.</p>
            <p>Where the child is very young, a medicine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſyrup of pennyroyal, eſſence of antimony, and laudanum, will be more readily got down; and provided the ſyrup is made of expreſſed juice without boiling, and given while it is in a ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, it will purge ſufficiently; and, I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to affirm, ſooner relieve the patient than the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0218200600:63"/>poiſon with which the malefactors of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were deſtroyed; and if the child wears at the ſame time a bark ſhift, a complete cure will ſoon be the conſequence; though it may be ſometimes requiſite to add oxymel to this mixture, where a quantity of phlegm upon the lungs makes its uſe neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Hitherto then we have only conſidered the cure of the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, and ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſecond, which generally ariſes from neglect in not clearing the <hi>primae viae</hi> by art, when the efforts of nature to expel the offending matter by the mouth are not accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>In this ſtage we have full evidence, that the lungs, the ſtomach, and the inteſtines are all affected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſpurious peripneumony invades the little patient, at the ſame time that the phlegm, which paſſes from the ſtomach into the inteſtines, brings on a diarrhoea that may end in a dyſentery, if the child happens to live. Nevertheleſs, this ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is not without its advantages, where the child happens to be troubled with worms, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which cauſes it is a, moſt powerful vermifuge. The mucus with which children's bowels are lined, is a proper nidus for the breeding and increaſe of theſe vermin, and there is not any thing more powerfully diſſolves and deſtroys this aſylum than putrid matter, when they are expelled along with the faeces.</p>
            <p>The coming away of worms is often the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of inoculation, when the variolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has contaminated the whole maſs of humours,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0218200600:64"/>and part of it enters the inteſtines. A boy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally broke a penknife blade in the nates, where part of it remained ſome time, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſinous ulcer, which collected and retained a conſiderable quantity of matter, that became putrid by ſtagnation. The more active parts of this matter being abſorbed, brought on a diarrhoea, in which an incredible number of worms both dead and living came away, and thus entirely cured the lad of a diſeaſe under which he had long laboured. I could indeed produce many ſimilar inſtances, but theſe are ſufficient to ſhew thoſe unacquainted with theſe things, that the, ſlimy matter which comes away in fevers is not the ſkins of dead worms; nor are we to believe, without farther evidence, that the child has the worms, but that it is the mucus of the inteſtines ſet at liberty by putrid matter, and then diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the common manner.</p>
            <p>However, though we look upon putrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the inteſtines as a remedy in ſome caſes, we are not to forget that it is a diſeaſe; and, therefore, rhubarb and ſpermaceti ſhould be given as often as neceſſary, to clear the bowels, which may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be defended from acrid matter, and healed by taking ſtarch, mutton ſuet diſſolved in milk, or the pulv. c. chele. e. and ſpermaceti mixed; and the common ſaline julep, with eſſence of antimony in it, will be found ſerviceable in abating the fever: but above all things, bliſters are moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for when the load of phlegm upon the lungs has been exceſſive great, the cough ceaſed, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0218200600:65"/>an oedema has appeared all over the body, I have frequently ſeen, after they have diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little, the cough return with a large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration of phlegm, and the little patient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſnatched from the jaws of death. Nevertheleſs, medicines proper for the ſpurious peripneumony may, if needful, here take place; and when the fever is abated, and the difficulty of breathing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the blood and fibres muſt be invigorated, by having recourſe to the bark, to which bees wax or ſpermaceti may be added, if an excoration of the bowels ſtill require their uſe. But if the hooping-cough does depend upon ſome peculiar diſpoſition in the air, ſurely the child ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into an air where this diſpoſition does not prevail, any thing ſaid to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</p>
