            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THE two ſcenic Muſes had long kept a diſtance,</l>
            <l>And ſcorn'd of each other to borrow aſſiſtance;</l>
            <l>THALIA was pert, and MELPOMENE proud,</l>

            <l>Not two rival beauties on earth could be ſeen</l>
            <l>More tortur'd with jealouſy, envy and ſpleen:</l>

            <l>Appeal'd to their ſenſes, and pointed to YOUNGE.</l>

               <l>IN Shakeſpeare's days we only play'd the fool,</l>

                     <p>I ſee into it, this accounts for the warm impetuous paſſion of Cheaterly; the girl and her fortune were no doubt to be ſacrificed, between him and my worthy ſpouſe.

               <l>OUR growing Levities too clearly ſhow,</l>
               <l>That all our troubles from refinement flow.</l>
               <l>Two ages ſince we valu'd plain attire,</l>
               <l>Blue-apron'd was the Dame, ſtraight-hair'd the Squire;</l>
               <l>They call'd not houſhold bus'neſs vulgar cares,</l>
               <l>Nor deem'd it ungenteel to ſay their pray'rs:</l>
               <l>But arts improv'd, new Levities aroſe,</l>
               <l>And Ladies chang'd the faſhion of their clothes;</l>
               <l>Hoop'd petticoats in ev'ry town were ſeen:</l>
               <l>The ſnug rotunda pleas'd the virgin Queen,</l>
               <l>And beef for breakfaſt ſerv'd her Lady-train;</l>
               <l>No wonder that her ſailors baffled Spain.</l>
               <l>Yet ſtill we've chiefs with love of glory fir'd;</l>
               <l>But ſo had Rome when liberty expired;</l>
               <l>"We've ſtateſmen too, who burn with patriots flame,</l>
               <l>"But ſo had Greece, when Greece had loſt her fame."</l>
               <l>"We've admirals who plow the briny deep,</l>
               <l>"Through azure ſkies and rolling clouds they ſweep,</l>
               <l>"Invade the Planets in an Air Balloon,</l>
               <l>"And fright from her propriety the Moon"—</l>
               <l>Beſs was a man, when danger call'd her pow'rs,</l>
               <l>She was a woman in her private hours—</l>
               <l>Few Levities, few luxuries ſhe knew;</l>
               <l>No cherries then in February grew:</l>
               <l>May-dukes in April on the bough hung green,</l>
               <l>And girls wore hanging-ſleeves till full eighteen.</l>
               <l>Few mothers teach their daughters grace or ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>But tell them taſte in dreſs is excellence:</l>
               <l>Bid them the Levities of rank aſſume,</l>
               <l>And flaunt with ſpreading bow, or nodding plume;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0057603100:100"/>Strut in a riding-dreſs, to ſhew their ſhapes;</l>
               <l>Or ſtalk in boots, and coats with tripple capes.</l>
               <l>Affecting eaſe, but impudently free,</l>
               <l>The matron leans upon her ciciſbee;</l>
               <l>While <hi>cara ſpoſa</hi> ſnugly keeps his wench,</l>
               <l>Defies his duns, and revels in the Bench.</l>
               <l>"Why, this is vice, not folly?" I agree;</l>
               <l>But ſtill this vice proceeds from Levity.</l>
               <l>Some ſouls there are which moral ſenſe ſublimes,</l>
               <l>A few bleſt ſpirits in the worſt of times;</l>
               <l>One in whom birth and piety are join'd;</l>
               <l>Of native worth, and truly royal mind;</l>
               <l>Who with benignant hand her bleſſings pours;</l>
               <l>Who knows no Levities, but feels for yours.</l>
