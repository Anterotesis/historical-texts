            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

fill with air, and empty, as it chuſes. When the bladder is filled, the fiſh is lighter than the water, and riſes to the top: when the bladder is emptied, the fiſh is heavier, and ſinks to the bottom.—Some fiſh keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at the bottom, becauſe they find their food there.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the old Teſtament many difficulties ariſe from our not conſidering, that God acted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1128000100:14"/>
in a different manner in the early ages of the world, and particularly towards the Jews, from that, in which he acts now.—Beſides, we make difficulties ourſelves by ſuppoſing, that many actions are allowable, becauſe they are done by good men. Whereas, in fact, many of theſe actions were never intended for our imitation. Some of them were bad in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and many things, tho allowed under the law of Moſes, are not permitted by the goſpel.— Laſtly, as the Bible is the oldeſt book, that ever was written, it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that many things may have become obſcure, and difficult through length of time.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> It is generally ſuppoſed there are much fewer, than might have been expected from its ancient date; and from the Jewiſh ways of ſpeaking, and Jewiſh cuſtoms, which we find in it, and which are ſo different from ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Give me an inſtance of ſome <hi>way of ſpeaking</hi> among the Jews, that is different from ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Our Saviour ſays, <hi>He that hateth not his father, and mother, cannot be my diſciple:</hi> but he means only, that we ſhould love God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we do our fathers and mothers—and the Jews underſtood it in that ſenſe.—
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1128000100:15"/>
Again, where it is ſaid <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated;</hi> nothing is meant but that God intended to raiſe the Jewiſh nation from Jacob.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> What inſtances can you give me of difficulties ariſing from <hi>Jewiſh cuſtoms?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We are told that a man was let down through the tiling of a houſe before Jeſus. This would be difficult in our houſes; but was very eaſy in a Jewiſh houſe, which was often only one ſtory high—had a flat roof— and ſometimes a trap door through the roof, into the chamber below; with ſtairs on the outſide. So that nothing was eaſier, than to carry the man to the top of the houſe, and let him down through the roof.—To ſuch houſes our Saviour alludes, when he ſays, <hi>He that is on the houſe-top, let him not come down into the houſe.</hi> And, <hi>What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye from the houſe-top;</hi> which was the moſt convenient way of ſpeaking to the people; becauſe the windows were high, and latticed.—When we are told alſo, that <hi>new wine will burſt old bottles,</hi> it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, when we know that the Jewiſh bottles were made of leather.—Again, we read in the ſtory of the good Samaritan, that he <hi>pulled out two-pence and gave it to the hoſt;</hi> which appears to us a very trifling ſum. But the penny that paſſed in Judea, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1128000100:16"/>
more than ſeven pence of our money; ſo that two-pence was as much as fifteen or ſixteen pence with us; and as things were cheaper in Judea than they are here, fifteen or ſixteen pence would buy as much as four or five ſhillings could buy now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But ſtill the ſcripture may be falſe; what reaſon have you for believing it is true?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe there were people alive, when it was written, who could remember the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and other things mentioned; and could compare the things done, with the things that were written: and if it had been found to mention things that had never been done, it would not have been ſuffered to come down to us as true.—Learned men alſo can even trace up the new Teſtament from its being mentioned in different books, to the very time, when it was written.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> My not feeling it, is no more a reaſon for my diſbelieving it, than my not feeling my ſoul is a reaſon for my diſbelieving I have one. As the ſcriptures therefore aſſure me I ſhall be aſſiſted by the holy ſpirit of God, and as it is not in the leaſt more difficult to believe, than the union of my ſoul, and body, I believe it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I mean that my body ſhall riſe from the grave, and be united again to my ſoul.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes. There is no more reaſon for my diſbelieving, that God will raiſe my body again from the duſt, than that God created man at firſt out of duſt. So I believe the ſcripture account of both.—Beſides, I ſee many things in the world like ſuch a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. I ſee trees dying in winter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving in ſummer; I ſee corn buried in the earth; and ſhooting up again in the ſpring.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I believe, that at the end of this world, we ſhall be called into judgment for what we have done, while we lived upon earth: and that we ſhall be rewarded, or puniſhed, as we have obeyed, or diſobeyed the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, many: This world has every where the appearance of a ſtate of trial—ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of a ſtate of full reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We ſee many inequalities in it—vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue often afflicted—and vice in proſperity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It ſhould be a <hi>check on the badneſs of my thoughts, words, and actions.</hi> If a bad thought ſhould ever come into mind, I ſhould immediately turn it out, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that God ſees it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I ought to praiſe God for his mercies —to beg his pardon for my ſins through the atonement of Chriſt—to pray for the aſſiſtance

of his holy ſpirit in all my religious duties —and for his bleſſing on all my worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No: family prayer is highly proper, and may be uſed in moſt families: but <hi>public worſhip</hi> at church ſhould be omitted by none.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> We have our Saviour's example, who uſed, on the ſabbath-day to go to the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, which was the Jewiſh church.—Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip alſo is frequently recommended in different parts of ſcripture.

neighbours. If they are ſo abſurd, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that God Almighty has placed them in ſuperior ſtations, out of any particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, which he has for them; and ſo leaves them at liberty to ſpend all they have upon themſelves, they will in the end find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſadly miſtaken; and will have a ſtrict account to give (as our bleſſed Saviour tells them) of the talents, with which they have been intruſted.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> I can never be ſo good, as to deſerve the happineſs of everlaſting life. My ſins will deſerve puniſhment, and I ſhall ſtill want ſomething to ſave me from their effects.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But can you do <hi>any thing</hi> yourſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtaining ſalvation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I am aſſured, that after all I am an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant:</hi> but God is pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my imperfect ſervices, through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But now beſides the religious duties, which the goſpel points out, our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath ordained the two ſacraments of <hi>baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which in themſelves are things indifferent, but are rendered binding from their being appointed by him. What is the intention of theſe two ceremonies?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. <hi>In general</hi>
                     </hi> they are the <hi>ſigus</hi> of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving chriſtianity; and of God's giving us the privileges of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1128000100:34"/>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But what is the <hi>particular</hi> intention of each?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Baptiſm is intended by our bleſſed Saviour as the introduction, or entrance into his religion—and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to preſerve in our minds the devout remembrance of his death, and atonement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> The ſacraments you ſee then are not only the ſigns of our receiving the privileges of chriſtianity; but they hold out to us, the two greateſt truths of our religion. What are thoſe truths?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Baptiſm holds out to us, that we are <hi>fallen ſinners,</hi> by ſhewing us, through the ſign of water, that we muſt be purified by the grace of the goſpel.—And the Lord's Supper ſhews us by the ſigns of bread and wine, that we can only be pardoned through the atoneing blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But now as Chriſt hath ordained both theſe ſacraments, why do not all chriſtians think it as neceſſary to receive the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper, as to bring their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to be baptized?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They ought; but ſome neglect it, as they do other good things: and ſome are afraid of texts of ſcripture, which they do not underſtand.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Chiefly of a paſſage in St. Paul, where he ſays, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> To whom is the expreſſion of <hi>eating and drinking unworthily</hi> applied?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is applied chiefly to the Corinthians, who were guilty of drunkenneſs, and other crimes, when they received the Lord's ſupper, which was adminiſtered then in private houſes; and often at the time of feaſting. Whereas we, who receive it in churches, where there is no feaſting, cannot be guilty of the ſame wicked practices, of which the Corinthians were guilty: tho at the ſame time, we may receive the ſacrament <hi>unworthily,</hi> if we do not piouſly remember the death and atonement of Chriſt, when we receive it; and reſolve as far as we can, to forſake our ſins, which were the cauſe of his death</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What do mean by <hi>eating and drinking damnation to yourſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This is ſtill applied to the unworthy manner in which the Corinthians received the Lord's ſupper: tho the word <hi>damnation</hi> means only, that God will <hi>condemn</hi> us, or be angry with us, for <hi>eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,</hi> as he is for all other wicked things: but it does not mean, that we ſhall certainly be <hi>damned</hi> for it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe we can only once enter into the chriſtian religion; but we are required frequently to ſhew, that we are members of it, by remembring the death and atonement of our bleſſed Saviour, and by renewing the engagements, which we made, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came members of his holy religion.</p>

            <p>ALMIGHTY God, who through thy good providence hath added one day more to our lives, graciouſly accept our praiſe and thankſgiving for this, and all thy other mercies—for our creation—our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preſervation—and particularly for the hopes of future happineſs, which thou haſt given us through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.— That we may turn all thy mercies, as thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt them, into bleſſings, grant us the aſſiſtance of thy holy ſpirit, to make this, and every day, an improvement of the laſt. May we always conſider thou haſt created us to make us happy in heaven, if it be not through our own fault. Grant therefore, O Lord, that we may conſider ſin of every kind, as the worſt of all evils, becauſe it will deſtroy our ſouls.—And if, through the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, we ſhould be ſo unhappy, as to diſpleaſe thee by doing what we know is wrong, grant us thy grace immediately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and forſake it from our hearts, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy forgiveneſs, through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, who died to redeem us from ſin.—Let thy holy ſpirit, O Lord, guide,

and direct us in all our affairs, both ſpiritual, and temporal. To thee we commend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this (morning, evening.)
