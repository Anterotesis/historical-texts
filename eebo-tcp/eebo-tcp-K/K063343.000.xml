            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not trouble my kind Reader with a tedious Apology for the Publiſhing of this Narrative, but as I hope I have, by the Bleſſing of God, a due ſenſe of my Sins and the folly of my Youth; I think it my Duty to Almighty God and my Country, to Declare openly and truely, ſuch Things as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1051500400:4"/>
ſhall be for the Publick Good, and a warning to all Honeſt Men, that they may ſecure themſelves, their Houſes, Goods and Money, from the vile Practices of Highwaymen, Street-Robbers, and Houſe-Breakers, and all ſorts of Thieves; and I hope my unhappy Fate will be a warning to all Perſons againſt the committing ſuch Crimes, as I ſadly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and am to Suffer for, as the juſt Rewards of my Evil Deeds: I beg leave to ſay, that I was born of honeſt Parents at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who gave me a Sober and ſolid Education; and when I left my School, they put me to an honeſt Trade, a <hi>Cordwainer,</hi> to which I ſerv'd my Apprenticeſhip: At my firſt falling into this wicked Courſe of Life; being ſhort of Money, I made bold to Rob a <hi>Chandlers Shop</hi> of the Money-Box of about 30 s. at <hi>Collingbourn</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and got clear off without being any ways ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: Some time after that, my Maſter ſent me one <hi>Sunday</hi> to another <hi>Chandlers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Shop</hi> to get him a Shillingſworth of Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and there being no Body at Home, I cut the Bar of the Window off, and got in and Rifled all the Shop: I took all the Money I could find, it being about three half Crowns, and out of a merry Frolick I brought away all the Raiſins and Currants that were in the Shop, and they was like to betray me, but I ſtood it out, with a great Aſſurance, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1051500400:5"/>
ſo I got off. I was however, ſearch'd for the Money, but I had hid it in a parcel of Nettles, but in their ſearching of me they found ſome of the Raiſins in my Coat-Pocket; but as uſual, I inſiſted upon it, that I bought them at <hi>Andover</hi> Market the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, and they could not diſprove me, ſo I got clear off. Some ſhort time after, my Maſter ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to <hi>Andover</hi> Market with five Pound to buy ſome Leather, another Boy and I agreed together to feign a Story as if I had been Robb'd of the Money, ſo I went home and told my Maſter that I was Robb'd, and brought the other Boy, who was concern'd with me, who vouch'd it to be True; ſo the Boy and I ſhared the five Pound between us: This was done near <hi>Lurgerſhel</hi> in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Maſter ſometime after that, ſent me amongſt his Cuſtomers to get in ſome Money which was due to him, upon which I got up about three Pound, and as ſoon as I receiv'd it I went off with it, and made the beſt of my way for <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>; as ſoon as I came there, I got acquainted with a young Woman, and with her Aſſiſtance and my own, we ſoon ſpent the Money; when Madam found the Money gone, ſhe march'd off too, and then I was put to my Shift. Going one Market Day into the Market, I ſpy'd a young Woman, and ſaw her receive
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1051500400:6"/>
ſome Money, then I watch'd her till ſhe left the Town, when I follow'd her and overtook her, and knock'd her down, and Robb'd her of what Money ſhe had; afterwards I made her go into the Wood, where I made her comply to my Luſtful deſire; after I had my Will of her, I tied her to a Tree, and there left her; this Robbery was committed about two Miles from <hi>Salisbury.</hi> Afterwards I made my Addreſſes to a young Woman at a Place call'd <hi>Forthingbridge</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> I went there to Work Journey work, and ſo became acquainted with her; but after ſome ſmall Acquaintance, I went to Lodge at her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that was what I wanted, after I had lodg'd ſome ſhort Time there, I made bold to take up my Lodging with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which occaſion'd a Swelling in her Belly; finding herſelf with Child, ſhe and I conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Rob her Mother, which we did of twenty Pounds; after that we made the beſt of our way for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> there we liv'd upon the Reverſion of the Money till it was all gone: Then ſhe return'd once more to pay another viſit to her Mother, where the good old Woman receiv'd her and the Child, with abundance of Joy; I thought it not proper for me to appear, therefore I made the beſt of my way, and left the good old Woman to take care of her Dutiful Daughter and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Child.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1051500400:7"/>
After this I made the beſt of my way to ſee my Mother at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> I had not been long with her, but I took an opportunity to Rob her of fifty Pounds, and went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and there Gamed beſt part of the Money away: Then I took to Work at my Trade again, and from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I went to a place call'd <hi>Thornbury</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi>; and there I came acquainted with one Mrs. <hi>Low</hi> a Widow Woman, where we liv'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about ſix Months, and we took the Town in for about 30 <hi>l.</hi> then we Sold all off, and went to a Place call'd <hi>Weekware,</hi> and there the Biter was Bit; for I agreed with a <hi>Collier</hi> to go Partners with him, and was to give him 50 <hi>l.</hi> whereof I gave him 30 <hi>l.</hi> down, and was to pay him the other Monthly, but before I came to pay the firſt Payment, my very good Friend the <hi>Collier</hi> went off of the Ground, <hi>and ſo the Biter was Bit indeed,</hi> ſo I pack'd up my Awls and came packing away from thence.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to a Place call'd <hi>Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> and there I work'd very honeſtly for ſometime, till I was known by a Man that came from <hi>Thornbury,</hi> and was oblig'd to move farther, for fear of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, ſo I pack'd up my Awls there likewiſe, and went to <hi>Hereford</hi> City, and Work'd there very Honeſtly; till one Night I was in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a <hi>Higler,</hi> and he ſaid he was a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1051500400:8"/>
to a Place call'd <hi>Roſs,</hi> to buy ſome Fowls; I readily reply'd, I don't care if I go along with you, he ſaid he ſhould be very glad of my Company, but poor Man, he little thought I ſhould deprive him of his Journey; the next Day accordingly we ſet out, and had not gone above four Miles but I attack'd my Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Traveller, and robb'd him of two Shillings; I thought that but a very ſmall matter of Money for him to buy Poultry with, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had a thought came into my Head to ſearch the Hampers, and accordingly I did, where I found twelve Pounds; ſo I left him his Hampers to look on, but his Horſe I took, and rid him about 40 Miles, and then turn'd him looſe: After that I went to <hi>Marlborough</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and ſtay'd there about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, there I was taken and put into <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> Goal for a Silver pint Mug where I remain'd about a Fortnight, but one Night I took an Opportunity and made my Eſcape, and never had the Manners to take my leave of my new Landlord, which gave me ſome uneaſineſs, but that ſoon went off.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to ſee an <hi>Aunt</hi> of mine, at a Place call'd <hi>Douton,</hi> within ſeven or eight Miles of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and there I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd till my <hi>Uncle</hi> and <hi>Aunt</hi> began to have Words about me; but the firſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity I had, I took my Leave of my <hi>Uncle</hi> and Aunt, and went afterwards to my own
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1051500400:9"/>
Siſter, and there liv'd with her about ſix Months, and I met with an old Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, where we renew'd our former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and began to play ſome of our old former Pranks; for we thought, what we took from our own Friends, was our own, and no Robbery, we having in our Opinion, as much right to it as them; ſo we very diſhoneſtly, and he like an unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Son, began with his own Mother, and robb'd her to the Value of about fifty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or three Pounds; and then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to our old Courſe of Life, Gaming, as we had done before; but we was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of our Aim, for we was ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and taken, and brought Home to his Mother's, where we were mightily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to own the Robbery, but we as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al brazen'd it out; but after all, they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us before a Juſtice of the Peace, and he very honeſtly committed us to <hi>Bridewell</hi>; where not approving of our new Lodging, we thought it not convenient for us to ſtay, therefore we made our Way thro' the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary-Houſe, without ſo much as taking Leave of our Landlord.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I turn'd Jockey, and went to Horſe-Courſing, and took as many Horſes one Spring, out of the King's New-Foreſt, near <hi>Rumſay,</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> as I ſold for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove threeſcore Pounds, at thirty and forty
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1051500400:10"/>
Shillings a-piece; they were none of your large Horſes, but only little Foreſters; and indeed, I went ſo often, that I was aſham'd to go any more, for fear that the People ſhould think much of my Coming, ſo I thought it beſt to leave off in Time; but ſoon after I ſtole a Horſe, and ſet up a new Trade, but do not think it proper to name the Man, that I ſtole the Horſe from, becauſe the Owner of it is a-live, and he knows me. I went to work, and the firſt Man I met with in that Way, was one Mr. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> a Painter, and I robb'd him of eighteen Shillings and a Plate-button-Coat, and coming bravely off of that, put more Courage into me; and I bought me a Pair of Piſtols with ſome of the Money, for I had but one before, and then I was ſtock'd very well. And ſo I proceeded on too,</p>
            <p>The next Adventure, which was with an old Man, that was going to Market, to buy a Pig, but I ſoon ſtopp'd his Journey, and robb'd him, and took what Money he had away from him, and ſent him Home about his Buſineſs; the Man is ſince dead, he lived at a Place called <hi>White-Pariſh,</hi> near <hi>Salisbury,</hi> his Name was <hi>John Price,</hi> a Taylor. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I went on with my old, or rather new Game, and with Abundance of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, having pretty good Succeſs, the next that I met with was a Butter-Woman, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1051500400:11"/>
from <hi>Rumſay-Market,</hi> and I robb'd her of twelve Shillings, and made her go about her Buſineſs; ſhe had not been gone long, but came by a Servant-Maid, juſt out of Place, ſo I made bold to rifle her of all the Money ſhe had. The Sum mounted to three and fifty Shillings, and a Ring from her, and after having ſerved her ſo, I thought it Pity to let her carry a Box of Luggage, and eaſed her of that alſo; in the Box I found two Suits of Cloaths, and Linnen, and other Neceſſaries, which ſerved for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Charges, ſo I came away about my Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and there I diſpos'd of the Box of Cloaths, and afterwards I went to the <hi>Cock Alehouſe,</hi> in <hi>High-Street,</hi> and after ſometime Drinking, I fell into Diſcourſe with a <hi>Laceman</hi> about Travelling, till the <hi>Laceman</hi> told me he was going to <hi>Amsbury</hi> Fair, in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> I told him I was going that Way too, ſo at Night, when we got to <hi>Amsbury,</hi> and put up our Horſes, at the Sign of the <hi>Chopping-Knife,</hi> at one Mr. <hi>Hedges</hi>'s, from whence the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> went out to take a Standing for to ſell his Goods in; and the while he was gone, I went to the <hi>Landlord,</hi> and asked him for my Partner's Box of Lace, and he gave it to me, and I went to the <hi>Hoſtler,</hi> and got my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1051500400:12"/>
Horſe, and away I went, and left the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord</hi> and the <hi>Laceman</hi> to agree.</p>
            <p>The next I met with, a bonny <hi>Scot,</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling over the Plain, going towards the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vizes,</hi> and I ſaid, well over-taken Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>How Mon, how done you,</hi> but he did not know me, but I knew him, ſo aſked him if he had any good Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and ſaid Yea, he put down his Pack, and opened it, and ſhowed me ſeveral Sorts of Goods, among which I ſaw a large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Hair, which is a good Commodity; ſo I ſaid to my Friend <hi>Johnſon, that I did not want to buy any Thing of him, for I muſt have them for nothing</hi>; but he began to make Words about that, and was going to be <hi>obſtropolous,</hi> till I ſhew'd him the Piſtols; and then he begged very heartily not for to uſe him ill, and take all that he had, upon which I took him about forty Yards from his Pack, and there tied him to the Poſt of a Well, and then went and ſearched the Pack all over, and found therein nine Pounds odd Money, and a great Parcel of Hair, as much as I ſold at <hi>Marlborough</hi> for eight Pounds. I alſo took ſix Dozen of Handkerchiefs, and a Quantity of Muſlin, all that was light Carriage; and when I had took as much as I thought proper, I went and releaſed the <hi>Scotchman</hi> from the Well, that he might take Care of his Pack again, and then I took my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1051500400:13"/>
Leave of Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and he paid his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in a very handſome Manner, but it was more out of <hi>Fear,</hi> than <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had parted from the <hi>Scotchman,</hi> I met with a jolly Shepherd, that had been at a Place call'd <hi>Burfet-Fair</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and had ſold a Quantity of Sheep for his Maſter, but that was a Miſtake of mine, to ſay, that he ſold them for his Maſter, <hi>I ſhould rather have ſaid, he had ſold them for me</hi>; for I met him at a Place call'd <hi>Humington,</hi> about two Miles from the <hi>Fair,</hi> where he ſold the Sheep, and there I attack'd him, but he was a good old Fellow, for before he would part with his Money, he would have a Duel; I was loth to kill him, becauſe he was a brave Fellow, ſo I fought him with my Hanger, till the old Fellow yielded, and then I rifled him all over, and took from him ſeventy odd Pounds, which he had receiv'd for the Sheep, upon which he ſaid, that if he had had his <hi>Crook,</hi> he would not a Loſt his Money without he had been kill'd; but as I have not my Weapon, ſays he, I muſt ſubmit, and ſo he went homewards about his Buſineſs. After which I went away about mine alſo, to a Place call'd <hi>Dortcheſter,</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and there I ſtay'd till beſt Part of my Money was waſted, where I took up with a broken <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> to be my Companion, but I was dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of him, for fear that his Heart ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1051500400:14"/>
fail him, but it did not, for he proved to be a good Fellow, and ſo we agreed very well together, for ſome Time, till he began to ſink ſome of the Monies out of our Stock; but I found him out, and told him of it, and he owned it, but ſaid he never would do ſo no more, and ſo we agreed and went on together.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Butcher</hi> and I went to a Place call'd <hi>Woodbury-Hill-Fair,</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and there we tarry'd till the Fair was over, and then our Fair began. We attack'd a Man that had been ſelling of Cheeſes, but he had but a ſmall Matter of Money about him, for he had paid it away, for we ſee him receive above fourſcore Pounds; but when we came to ſearch him, he had not above twelve Pounds about him; on which we fell a <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> our hard Fortune, and we gave him four or five good Licks with our Whips, <hi>and bid him never pay Money away when Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen waited to receive it</hi>; but the old Man went homewards very heavy Hearted as it was, we did not take above twelve Pound from him, which was but a ſmall Trifle to what we expected; and ſo we left the honeſt <hi>Cheeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next was an honeſt <hi>Hop-Merchant,</hi> who anſwer'd our Expectation very well, but we may thank his Wife for our Booty, for when we begun to ſearch him, we did not find any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1051500400:15"/>
Money about him, till we began to Curſe and Swear, and ſaid we would kill him, and then the good Wife cry'd out, do not kill him, and I will tell you where the Money is; ſo I ask'd her, and ſhe ſaid, it was in his Boots, upon which I took my Knife out of my Pocket and cut his Boots off of his Legs, and there found in his Boots fifty Guineas, which I liked the Looks of very well; ſo I took and put them in my Pocket, and we went ſmiling away about our Buſineſs; returning Thanks to the good Woman for our Booty.</p>
            <p>From thence I and my Friend went away together from <hi>Woodbury-Hill,</hi> to a Place call'd <hi>Sherbourn,</hi> and there we ſtaid and took our Pleaſure for ſome Time, and we got each of us a fine Laſs to divert us by the way, ſo we ſtaid and enjoy'd our ſelves as well as we could for ſome Time, when we had Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Graſier</hi> going further down into the Country to buy ſome lean Beaſt to fatten; upon which we went after him and robb'd him of all the Money he had, which was fourſcore and ten Pounds; with which we diverted our ſelves, and came back again in hopes of more Buſineſs, and went to a place call'd <hi>Ringwood</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and there my Friend happened to fall ſick, and lay for ſome Time, till that Money was almoſt conſumed; and then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty well again, I took him down to the <hi>Bath</hi> with me, where we ſtaid about ſix Weeks,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1051500400:16"/>
and then we fell to work again, and robb'd the Stage Coaches going from <hi>Bath</hi> to <hi>London</hi>; and took them as they came back again from <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and continued that Practice till they were oblig'd to hire People to guard the Coach to and fro, as it paſſed from <hi>Bath</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and from <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Bath</hi>: We robb'd the Stage for ſix Weeks together, as it paſſed to and fro every Time; but once we were like to receive Damage by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Coach, for as we went up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Money, the Gentleman fired a Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſs at us, but miſs'd us both; however, we robb'd them afterwards, and well Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whipp'd the Gentleman for his Reward, and then we came away about other Buſineſs of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>The next Adventure was at a Place call'd <hi>Hungerford,</hi> and there we ſtaid for two Months, where I made up a Match for my Friend to be marry'd to a Widow Woman, one of his own Trade; ſo we liv'd very well there, till ſuch time we were blow'd by ſomebody that knew us, and was very near being taken, but by good Conduct we got away ſafe, and came to <hi>Newberry,</hi> which was not a great ways from the Place where we was put to the Rout; that did not put any ſtop to our Proceedings, we met with a <hi>Tallow-Chandler,</hi> not far from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> and we robbed him of what he had; then we concluded to go and ſee one of the Wonders of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1051500400:17"/>
the Country, a Place called <hi>Stoneage,</hi> where we ſtaid about three or four Days, and then we concluded to make our way further from our Enemies, and agreed to come to <hi>London,</hi> which accordingly we did, and proceeded on our Journey till we came to <hi>Reading,</hi> and there we was like to be taken again by the <hi>Bath</hi> Stage Coachman; but I and my Friend were pretty well mounted, and by good Luck got away, and rode that Night, and the next Day, from <hi>Reading</hi> to <hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and there we were ſafe; ſo we remained there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Weeks; but being very uneaſy in our Minds, for fear we ſhould be taken, we agreed to part by Conſent, and accordingly we did; and he went back to <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> again, and I ſet out for <hi>Salisbury</hi> to ſee my Friends, and ſtaid there about a Week: After which I ſet out again for <hi>London</hi> once more, by a round about way, and in coming to <hi>London,</hi> I met with four young Sparks who were going for <hi>Oxford,</hi> but the merry Joke was, that after I had attack'd and had ſearch'd them, I could not find any Money about two of them, but the other two I had rifled, and took from them their Money and Watches, and was riding away therewith; they called to me, and told me that their Companions had Money about them, ſo I went to Work again, and at laſt I found Money upon one of them, planted under the Buttons of his Coat, and eas'd him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1051500400:18"/>
of ten Guineas I found there; his Watch he had convey'd into his Cod-piece, but happening to find it there I made bold to keep it: The other had his Money planted in the Cape of his Coat that goes round his Collar, and his Watch he had convey'd to one of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but being willing that they ſhould be ſerv'd all alike, he held the Watch in his Hand, with the Chain hanging down, that I might ſee it, which I did, and took it from him, and then they could not laugh one at another, for I am ſure they had no Occaſion, becauſe they were ſerv'd all alike. I have laugh'd at the Fancy many Times, to think of their telling of the others having Money about them; but I did not like them never the worſe when I heard them ſpeak of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when I found it, I did not grudge my Time of looking for it, otherwiſe I ſhould have thought much of my Time, ſo I took my Leave of them and came my ways for <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>London,</hi> I liv'd very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and went to Work Journey-work at my Trade, and Lodg'd at one Mr. <hi>Rickets</hi> a Shoe-maker in <hi>Harp-Alley, Shoe-Lane,</hi> and there Work'd for about Six Months, for Mr. <hi>Holliday,</hi> Shoe-maker upon <hi>Ludgate-Hill</hi>; and from thence I moved into <hi>Leather-Lane</hi> in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> and there I Work'd almoſt Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>months; till at laſt I took up with a Harlot of the Town; I had not kept her Company
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1051500400:19"/>
more then ſix Days, but ſhe was Arreſted and carried to the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> and the next Day I got her Bail'd out, and then they Arreſted her in the <hi>Borough-Court,</hi> and I Bail'd her again, and brought her home with me to one Mr. <hi>Wood</hi>'s a Shoe-maker, in <hi>Three-Leg-Alley</hi> near <hi>Fetter-Lane</hi>; but all this while, this was to make a Mouth of me, and to take me in for ſome ready Money, but I had none then, but I had a Legacy of Ten Pounds a Year in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and they were perſuading me to ſell it; and at laſt I went to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> and to the Jobbers for that purpoſe, but I could not agree with them for it, ſo at laſt I ſold it to one Mr. <hi>Littlefield,</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, in St. <hi>Paul's Church-Yard,</hi> and he gave me Fourſcore Pounds for it; and then my Miſtreſs was pleas'd, for there was a great Score to the Landlord for Rent, and he Swore and Damn'd that he would ſend her to the <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> again if he had not his Money; that was to make me the more fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Froe, but I Paid them nothing at that time, but I took her out a long with me into <hi>Monmouth-ſtreet,</hi> and there I bought her a ſuit of blue Flower'd Sattin Cloaths, and every thing elſe that was agreeable to ware with them; and then we came home again, and the Houſe was like a Mad Houſe for Money, there was G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>'d firſt, then the Old Bawd came to me and Sweeten'd me up with abundance of fine Words; and ſaid my <hi>Dyer, your</hi> Alice <hi>is a fine Woman now ſhe is dreſs'd</hi>; come let us have a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Brandy to Drink Mr. <hi>Dyer,</hi> and his Spouſe's good Health; <hi>Mary,</hi> go and fill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother quartern of Brandy, and call Mrs. <hi>Dyer</hi> to her Spouſe; come Mr. <hi>Dyer</hi> ſit down and bring your Wife with you; is not Mr. <hi>Dyer</hi> and his Spouſe a very likely Couple; <hi>Moll</hi> you B<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1051500400:21"/>
let us take a walk and ſee Mrs. <hi>Shelton,</hi> and there we ſhall ſee my Siſter; ſo away we goes, and when we came to Mrs. <hi>Shelton</hi>'s, the firſt Compliment was, Pray Mr. <hi>Dyer,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Dyer,</hi> how do you both do, you was the laſt People that my <hi>Tom</hi> and I was talking about, we was talking about that ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that your Spouſe owes us, Pray ſaid I, how much is it? but two and forty Shillings, well I put my Hand in my Pocket and Paid him, and took a Receipt.</p>
            <p>Some ſhort Time after this Tranſaction, another Woman and ſhe fell out, one of her fellow Trade, and one that knew her Secrets, and then ſhe told me that there was no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney due to Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> when I paid him the five Guineas, nor there was none due to Mrs. <hi>Shelton,</hi> but that ſhe wanted the Money in her own Pocket, for ſhe thought ſhe would make Hay while the Sun ſhone. Well this paſſed on for ſome Time, and I took no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notice about it at all, but ſoon after that her Husband came from Sea, and came and knock'd at the Door one Morning about four o'Clock, and asked if one Mrs. <hi>Davis</hi> did not live there, and I told him yes. I did not know that ſhe had a Husband before, for I took it for one of her Culls, till ſhe look'd out of the Window, and then ſhe ſaid, my Dear <hi>Johnny</hi> it is my Husband, what ſhall I do; ſo I put my Cloaths on, and came down
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1051500400:22"/>
one pair of Stairs and went to Bed to another Harlot, and there lay till Madam and her Husband came down Stairs; ſo I went away about my Buſineſs, and came home at twelve a Clock, and my Brother was gone Aboard a Ship, but he came home at Night and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd me of my Bed-fellow; but the Cream of the Jeſt was, that my Madam ſham'd Jealous of the Woman that I went to Bed to, but ſhe was not Jealous of me, but of my Money. But however, ſomebody had let her Husband know that I kept her Company, but he took no notice of me, but he Curs'd and Swore every time he ſaw me; but in ſhort, he Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted me, and put me into the <hi>Compter,</hi> and I got Bail'd out again, and then I Arreſted him for Meat, Drink, and Lodging for his Wife, and I put him into the <hi>Compter,</hi> and there he remain'd a great while, till at laſt he ſent for me to come to him, which I did; ſo we came to an agreement, he gave me a Note of Ten Pounds, and I let him out, and have not ſeen him never ſince, ſo farewel, Brother Tar. Soon after that, I was Married to an honeſt Woman, and then I took a <hi>Coblers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Stall</hi> in <hi>Leather-lane,</hi> and liv'd very well if I could have been contented, but I was like a great many more young Men, did not love Work; but preſently after that I had taken this Stall, a young Man in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that was a little low in the World, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1051500400:23"/>
wanted Money, but did not know how to get any, open'd his mind to me one Night as we was a walking in the Fields; and ſaid he muſt go upon the Highway, or elſe he muſt go to Priſon; ſo I asked him if ever he did any ſuch thing? he ſaid no; and I asked him if he had any Piſtols, he ſaid no, but he would Pledge his Watch and buy a Pair, and accordingly he did; and he and I went out one Night together, and at the old <hi>Spaw</hi> we ſtop'd a Man and Rob'd him of his Watch and two Rings and what Money he had, which was not much, it was about 7 or 8 <hi>s.</hi> in Silver; and from thence we went farther into the Fields, and by <hi>Sadlers-Wells</hi> we rob'd another Gentleman of his Watch and one Cypher Ring with a Heart in it, and a pair of Silver Buckles, his Hat and Wig, and then we ty'd his Hands and Legs and came away and left him. My Companion thought that was a good and quick way to get Money, therefore he liked it ſo well, that he kept to it; ſo the next time that we went out, we had better Succeſs than we had before, for we ſtop'd a Gentleman's Chariot up by <hi>Pancras-waſh,</hi> and robb'd the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his Lady, to the Value of 30 <hi>l.</hi> in Goods and Money, and ſo we came home.</p>
            <p>Soon after which my Friend and I met one Mr. <hi>Lewen,</hi> the late City <hi>Marſhal,</hi> and robb'd him to the Sum of near eight Pounds, in <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey-Lane,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1051500400:24"/>
going towards <hi>Muzzle-Hill,</hi> and got ſafe away. The ſame Night we robb'd two more Men near <hi>Pancras</hi> Church, of about four or five Pounds, and being Weary we came home that Night. The next Engagement was in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where we ſtopp'd a Hackney Coach, and rifled the Men all over, but to a very little Purpoſe. And from thence we went to <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and there we pick'd up a <hi>Molley,</hi> and carry'd him to one Corner of the Rails, and we took from him a ſilver Watch, and about fifteen Shillings in Money, but the <hi>Molleying-Bitch</hi> had a Gooſe with him, which we made bold to take with us, and we had it roaſted the next Day for Dinner, and made our ſelves very Merry over it. The next was a merry Frolick which happen'd in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>'s-<hi>Inn-Fields</hi>: I and my Conſort one Night ſet upon a Man in <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s-<hi>Inn-Fields,</hi> and robb'd him, and he went about his Buſineſs as we thought; but we ſtaid there for ſome Time after we robb'd him, we were ſurrounded with fifteen or ſixteen Watchmen; they came in all four Ways upon us, that we did not know very well what to do, but being both of a Mind, to be kill'd before we would be taken, ſo the Watchmen at laſt gather'd themſelves near together, and were coming to look for us we did ſuppoſe, but we did not give them the Trouble, for we went and met them, and came as nigh them as we thought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1051500400:25"/>
might without danger of hurting them, and then we fired three Piſtols at them, and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards if you would have given a Hundred Pound for a Watchman you could not ſee one in the Fields, for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was he that could run faſteſt.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not be thought tedious in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this true and plain Account how I fell from the Paths of Virtue, and a ſober Religious Life in which my Dear Parents took great care to have render'd me an honeſt Man; I do not boaſt of my Sins, nor believe there is any real ſatisfaction in the doing what is ill, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God and Man: I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take ſhame to my ſelf, and do affirm that the foregoing <hi>Narrative</hi> is in every part true; I only rehearſe it to warn young Men eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to take notice by what degrees I fell into theſe Crimes, ſo that they may by the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent uſe of God's Grace, be preſerved from Iniquities: I have ſhewn how Maſters may be wronged by their Servants, who follow ſuch Vices as I own I have done, as well as to caution againſt the ſad conſequences of converſing with lewd Women, and as what I have already ſaid was Principally done in the Country. I ſhall now proceed plainly and briefly as I can, to ſhew what Company and more pernicious Adventures I have more late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been engag'd in, which has brought me to many dangerous Misfortunes, and render'd me liable to be Proſecuted, even by my vile
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1051500400:26"/>
Companions, whom often draw'd me into this Snare, but as a <hi>Land-mark,</hi> ſerves to warn the careful <hi>Marriner</hi> of Danger, ſo I propoſe in the remaining Part of this <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> impartially to Diſcover ſuch bold daring Dangers, and vile Attempts, as may ſecure ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Men from Danger for the future; which may in ſome means convince the World of my ſincere Repentance: I ſhall only beg leave to trouble my Reader, with two or three petty Accounts of my Actions, that I may thereby render the moſt weighty Matters contained in the following Pages clear, and of Uſe to thoſe who are ſo kind to read them.</p>
            <p>Some little Time after our Eſcape in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>'s-<hi>Inn Fields</hi> before mention'd; I and my Fellowmen robb'd a Gentleman and a Woman at <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> corner in a Hackney Coach, of a ſilver Watch, Snuff Box, and about four or five Pounds in Money, and a ſmall Cypher Ring, the Value of it was not very much, but they was very deſiring not to part with it, which made us the more eager to keep it; but we told the People <hi>that if it was not a Diamond one, they ſhould have it again, if they would let us know their Names, and where to direct for them, they ſhould have it again</hi>; (upon Honour) and accordingly we ſent it to them to the <hi>Devil-Tavern</hi> at <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> in a Penny-Poſt Letter, for it was no Service to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1051500400:27"/>
Some ſmall time after, we met a <hi>Clergyman</hi> near the ſame Place, where we Robbed him of all his Money, Watch, Hat and Wig, and ſo came Home for that Night.</p>
            <p>The next Prank we play'd was at <hi>Hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> going to <hi>Highgate,</hi> and there we Robbed the <hi>Barnet</hi> Stage Coach; there was but two Paſſengers in the Coach, and we Rifled them both, but they had but a ſmall quantity of Money about them, not above thirty Shillings between them; we ſtay'd there about all Night till Morning, and met with the <hi>Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Butchers</hi> going to <hi>Finchley</hi> to buy <hi>Hogs,</hi> but I believe it prevented their Journey, for they were oblig'd to go back again to fetch more Money before they could proceed on their Journey; for we took from them between forty and fifty Pounds, and came away about our Buſineſs; <hi>but I fear they were oblig'd to ſell Bacon very dear to fetch up their Money we took from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next was an honeſt <hi>Baker</hi> (if a <hi>Baker</hi> can be ſo) that we met coming from <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,</hi> but he was very much in Liquor, and which oblig'd us to tye his Hands and Feet before we could do any thing with him, and then we rifled him of twenty-five Pounds, a Silver Watch and two plain Rings, and left him in the Fields.</p>
            <p>We next met with a <hi>Hackney-Coach</hi> coming from <hi>Hampſtead,</hi> with two <hi>Taylors</hi> and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1051500400:28"/>
in it, we pull'd the <hi>Taylors</hi> out of the Coach to Search them, and then we handed their Lady out and rifled her alſo, but ſhe was worth both the <hi>Taylors,</hi> for ſhe had a very handſome Gold Chain about her Neck, and two good Rings on her Fingers, and a <hi>Spanker</hi> in her Pocket, and Seven or Eight Shillings in Silver, but the two poor <hi>Taylors</hi> not above four Shillings between them; ſo we bid the Coachman drive on, and I gave him half a Crown <hi>and bid him ſay nothing</hi>; but when they came to <hi>Tottenham-Court</hi> Turn-Pyke, the Coachman begun to cry out, <hi>Thieves and Rogues on the Road</hi>; but he little thought that we was ſo nigh them, for we heard every Word they ſaid, and ſo they went on about their Buſineſs, but the Coachman had better to have held his Tongue, and then he might have got home Safe, <hi>but he fared well, and cry'd Roaſt-meat</hi>; upon which as ſoon as he had paſs'd the Turn-Pyke we ſtop'd him and took the half Crown from him, that we had before given him, and twelve Shillings to boot, and made him go about his Buſineſs, which we ſaid would <hi>teach the Fool more Wit another Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an other Adventure, I and my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion undertook to rob the <hi>Salisbury</hi> Waggon, at <hi>Knightsbridge</hi>; there prov'd to be but one Paſſenger in it, who was a Country Fellow, and going into the Country; he had but a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1051500400:29"/>
ſmall Store of Money about him, and was very loth to part with it, but we frighted him into a Compliance, and left him Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, all he had was twelve Shillings and Six-pence. We had not Time, nor proper Opportunity, to take out any Boxes, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near the Town, and People paſſing hard-by, who probably ſaw what we were Doing; but they, and the Waggoners, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our being armed with ſeveral Piſtols, made free Way for our Eſcapes.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day we took a Tour to <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where we met with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on Horſeback, well mounted; my Partner ſuddenly took hold of his Horſe, whilſt I ſurprized the Gentleman, laying hold of him, preſented my Piſtol to his Breaſt, cock'd and prim'd, ſwearing, [<hi>The Lord in Mercy pardon me,</hi>] <hi>that I would ſhoot him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, if he did not inſtantly, without any Delay, or making any Noiſe, deliver what he had</hi>; and we took from him fourteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in Money, and a handſome ſilver Watch, cutting his Stirrups, and Horſe's Bridle, we left him unmounted, not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he could, or would attempt to follow after us; but unexpectedly, the enraged Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman mended the broken Bridle, that he mounted again, and purſu'd us with more <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> than with <hi>Prudence,</hi> for his own <hi>Safety</hi>; for he purſu'd us with ſo great Haſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1051500400:30"/>
that he forced us to attack him, in our own Defence, whilſt we ran over the Common; whereas, had he ſliely followed us, as he might have done, we having not the leaſt Apprehenſion of his being mounted, he might have eaſily apprehended us, when he had found us in a conveniently Place, where he might have had Aſſiſtance; but he, as I ſaid before, attack'd us by himſelf, that we were forced to unhorſe him again, to give him <hi>Blows</hi> for his <hi>Blows,</hi> and then, to bind him to ſtrick Obedience of our Pleaſure. <hi>viz. To lie quiet until we were out of Sight</hi>; and to ſpeak the Truth, we left him ſecure, until ſome might come to relieve him; and for his Horſe, we quite demoliſhed his Furniture, and turned him looſe, and by this Means got free from one of the moſt refractory Chaps I ever met with; in a Word, he acted as a Perſon <hi>drunk</hi> or <hi>mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We took our Way by <hi>Peckham</hi> to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and ſo over the Ferry, and ſo Home, to ſpend the ſad Fruits of our abominable Labour; and ſhortly after, as our Wants required, we took a Journey to <hi>Epping-Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> where looking for our Prey, we met with a Gentleman and his Lady in a Chaiſe; we civilly accoſt them, in our Way, deſiring them, <hi>To ſupply our Want of Money,</hi> which we hoped they could conveniently ſpare; which they being unwilling to do, we took
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1051500400:31"/>
the Boldneſs to oblige them to alight, and ſhewing our Piſtols, the Fear of Death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to ſubmit to be ſearch'd, and we found five Guineas and ſome Silver, and a ſilver Watch from the Gentleman, and a Ring and ſilver Snuff-Box from the Lady, who we uſed with great Tenderneſs, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that ſhe was in a great Fright, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they freely forgave us, and would never proſecute us, if it ſhould be in their Power, and ſo we parted with great Curteſy. This Booty ſerved us a little while, but we quickly <hi>turned out</hi> again, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to change our Horſes, Apparel, Wigs, and every Thing that was remarkable about us.</p>
            <p>The next Attempt we made, was on <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Common, were we met a <hi>Tallow-Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> coming from <hi>Ware,</hi> who was well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſomewhat obſtinate; however, we took from him eleven Guineas, and about ſeven or eight Shillings in Silver; we left him unhors'd, and made the beſt and ſureſt Way we could back to Town. Immediately after we met a Gentleman very drunk, on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> of whom we took five Pounds in Silver, his Hat and Wig, after he had been very ruſtical and fought with us. We were forced to prevent his Clamour and Noiſe, for he began to cry out aloud for Help; but we left him on the Ground, and took pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1051500400:32"/>
to our Heels. The ſame Morning we made our Way Home by <hi>Doctors-Commons, where we deſir'd a Gentleman to ſpeak with us,</hi> and telling him our Buſineſs, <hi>was wanting Money,</hi> we begged that he would ſpare what he had about him; the Gentleman was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd ſeeing our Commiſſion, a Piſtol, begged of us <hi>not to kill him,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>no Sir, We will not hurt your Body, it's your Money we want, and that we muſt, and will have</hi>; we were forced to rifle him, and took about thirty five Shillings; he did (<hi>ſtage much</hi>) that is our <hi>Cant</hi> Word for <hi>crying out</hi>; ſo we left him, and found no Manner of Annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Watchmen, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Coming to <hi>Fleet-Ditch,</hi> in <hi>Harp Alley,</hi> we met with a Perſon, who for ſome Reaſons I believe was a <hi>Grocer,</hi> he was ſurprized and ſtopt by us, we took from him fourteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, a Watch, and a Cane, which he was pretty eaſy to part withal, after we had put him into a trembling Fit. A few Days after we and our <hi>Doxies</hi> having conſumed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our ill-gotten Pelf, we turned into <hi>Gray</hi>'s-<hi>Inn-Lane,</hi> in our common Road, like Birds of Prey, and there we met with one of the Diſturbers of <hi>Human Society,</hi> I mean a <hi>Petty Fogging Lawyer</hi> (as he call'd himſelf) who upon our attacking him, told us his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and would argue with us, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great Danger we ſhould bring
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1051500400:33"/>
upon ourſelves, by provoking a Perſon of his Knowledge; how to find us out he knew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Highwaymen</hi>; ſome had been his <hi>Clients,</hi> and as for the <hi>Thief-Takers</hi> he knew all, in or about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> We had dragg'd him, partly by Force, and gentle Perſuaſions, to a convenient dark ſilent Place under the Walls, and found him ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, that I deſired my Partners to let him go; but one of them had felt his Pocket, and ſaid there was <hi>Swag</hi> in it, and obliged me to conſent that he might rifle his Pocket, where they found Thirty odd Shillings, and one of them took his Sword, gilt Handle, of little Value; the poor Gentleman was obliged to ſubmit, and has ſince made a moſt ſad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, to ſome of my Acquaintance, who aſſures me, that he pretended in <hi>Gray</hi>'s-<hi>Inn,</hi> to have loſt a great Sum of his Clients Money. We left him in a quiet Temper, and much I fear ſome Thieves as well as honeſt Men, have dearly paid for this Robbery, which was done very lately in the laſt long Vacation.</p>
            <p>Another very late Crime I committed with my Companion, was on a <hi>Victualler,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Merry with his Friends abroad, was reeling over <hi>Bloomsbury-Market,</hi> betwixt One and Two in the Morning; we attack'd him, and he pleaſantly asked, <hi>What we meant, what we wanted</hi>; our Reply was ſtill the Same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>We were Men of Fortune, and Money</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1051500400:34"/>
               <hi>was our Game.</hi> We had no Time, the Place would not admit of a long Diſpute, we flung him down, ſtopp'd his Mouth, (not to hurt him) then took from a ſilver Watch, Seventeen Shillings in Money, two plain Rings, and his Buckles out of his Shoes, and ſo <hi>wiſh'd him better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for the Future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards in <hi>Tottenham Court Road,</hi> we met with a Man coming to Town, we ſeized him by Surprize and took from him Forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four Shillings, and the Man was as Joyful to be rid of our Company, as we were to be free from him: I prevented his being ſtripp'd of his Cloaths, for I ever abhorr'd to leave any Perſon naked, or to offer any Violence to modeſt Women, but have often reſtrained the rude and cruel Behaviour of my unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Acquaintance, when ſuch Attempts have been deſigned.</p>
            <p>Another late Exploit was returning to <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> Road, where we met with two <hi>Gardiners,</hi> coming Drunk from Market, they prov'd very Troubleſome a-while, but we were too Strong for them, and our uſual Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted them to a Compliance, ſo we took 12 <hi>s.</hi> from them, and they having warm great Coats, and my Companions wanting them, took the Freedom to take them, and tied them Back to Back, diſabling them from purſuing us. In the long Field we robb'd Mr. <hi>Homes,</hi> commonly call'd Lord <hi>Homes,</hi> a Clerk at <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1051500400:35"/>
he had a Guinea and a Steel Seal, which was all he had about him, but the Patrole coming that way, which we were aware off, we made our Eſcape with great Precipitation. Other Crimes we committed, and laid wait to do, to the Prejudice of great Men, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular private Families, which may not in the Reading be unacceptable to the Reader.</p>
            <p>I not long ago meet with a Perſon of ſome diſtinction well known in this Town of the ſordid vile Company of <hi>Sodamites</hi> [I was clean dreſt and look'd freſh] in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn Fields,</hi> he pretended after ſeveral times turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looking hard at me to know me, and deſired me as I went along to go and drink a Glaſs of Wine with him at a Tavern, which I conſented to do, and he going to the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deſired a good Room up Stairs, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us into a Room next the Street, which happen'd luckily to my purpoſe; for this Gentleman (who is in Years) was very amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous upon me, and would by all means treat me with a Fowl or any thing I could Eat, which was order'd accordingly, and whilſt it was getting ready, he took a Diamond Ring from his Finger, ſaying it was a rich Stone; I begg'd the Favour to ſee if my Finger was not bigger then his, which he granted, and preſently after I had it on, I being near the Window and ſeeing a Coach going by, I call'd out ſtop Coach, pretending I had a Friend in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1051500400:36"/>
the Coach that I wanted to Speak with; I ran down Stairs, and ſo went off with the Ring. I ſhortly after met the ſame Gentleman under the great Arch in <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s-<hi>Inn-Fields,</hi> who in a Surpize told me he wondered that I carried away his Ring, I gave him a ſurley Anſwer, and ſo he went quietly away.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Whipmaker's</hi> Houſe in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> we broke open, and took a quantity of Whips from him one <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, and we came away ſafe.</p>
            <p>The next was a <hi>Shoemaker's</hi> Shop in <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Court</hi> near <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> and there I and my Companions, took away all the Shoes the Man had in his Shop, and likewiſe came off ſafe that Night.</p>
            <p>I am my Companion had a mind for a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Bit, ſo we open'd a <hi>Poulterer's</hi> Shop in <hi>Clare-Market,</hi> (with a falſe Key) and took a dozen of Chickens, and two Turkeys for our Selves and Doxies, juſt for our own Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſoon after one of our Doxies lay-in, and with the help of thoſe Chickens and two Turkeys, we made a grand Chriſtening, were we had ſome of our own Fraternity and Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies; but my Companion and I never had the good Manners to Invite the <hi>Poulterer</hi> and his Wife.</p>
            <p>Not long ſince we met a Man in <hi>Kirby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> near <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and we knock'd him down, and Robb'd him of his Hat and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1051500400:37"/>
Whig, and that was all, for we were diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from doing any more, for the Watch came and Surrounded us, that we was oblig'd to Fire before we could get away, but by good Luck we got off Safe.</p>
            <p>Then we broke open a <hi>Linnen Draper's</hi> Shop at the Sign of the <hi>Maiden-Head</hi> in <hi>Piccadilly,</hi> there we took a great Quantity of Linnen, as much as two of us could well bring away, and came off with it, without being Diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> The two laſt Robberies I was Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Convicted for at the laſt Seſſions, at the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> and am to Suffer To-morrow, at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for them.</p>
