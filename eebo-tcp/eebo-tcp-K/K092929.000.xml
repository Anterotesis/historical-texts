            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE pathology and practice of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine are (of all the arts and ſciences) the leaſt which approach to certainty and to truth; and the practitioners of phyſic are therefore too often diſpoſed to appeal to conjecture, analogy, and probability, in their judgment and treatment of moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, rather than to reaſon, philoſophy, and a ſcientific diſcernment of cauſes and effects.</p>
            <p>EVEN from the infancy of this art, we find reaſoning from falſe principles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0920100900:5"/>inſtead of obſerving, with accuracy, the uniform courſe of nature. The ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of diſeaſes are, therefore, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully noticed than their cauſes; and the practice of phyſic is, conſequently, more influenced by <hi>effects</hi> than by <hi>cauſes,</hi> which ſhould be the ſolid baſis upon which all reaſoning concerning diſeaſes ought to be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>THE innovation which was introduced in the practice of phyſic by the celebrated Dr. Sydenham, was of eſſential importance, ſo far as it was calculated to eſtabliſh a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and rational method of practice in all diſeaſes of a phlogiſtic or inflammatory nature; ſuch as the pleuriſy, ſmall-pox, meaſles, and diſeaſes of this deſcription.
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0920100900:6"/>But it is very evident, that in thoſe of an oppoſite nature, ſuch as nervous fevers, palſies, apoplexies, epilepſies, and all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of this nature, it muſt produce a different effect: and this is completely proved, by its bringing on, in theſe modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of diſeaſe, the very worſt of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and even death.</p>
            <p>THE principles and practice of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed phyſician have therefore had a bad effect, ſo far as they have been the means of introducing a dangerous practice in nine tenths of the diſeaſes of mankind. For they have found their way into all the principal ſchools of phyſic in Europe, and prevail, to a great extent in the practice of medicine, all over the world at this preſent time.</p>
            <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0920100900:7"/>
            <p>ALL nervous diſeaſes, and fevers in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ariſe more frequently from domeſtic anxieties, and paſſions of the mind, ſuch as grief, diſappointment, and deſpair, than from any other cauſes whatſoever. And in order to remove them, it is evident, that to increaſe the cauſe is not the method to remove the diſeaſe. But the idea that ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora, or too great a quantity of blood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in the body, and is therefore the cauſe of theſe diſeaſes, is a moſt pernicious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; conſequently bleeding, cupping, a ſpare diet, purging, and applications of this nature, are ſuppoſed to be efficacious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of theſe ſeveral diſeaſes; and more eſpecially when they affect athletic and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt people. This ſuppoſed cauſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0920100900:8"/>points out to a moſt dangerous method of cure.</p>
            <p>IT has been the ſtudy of a great part of my life to inquire into the defects which prevail ſo univerſally in the practice of phyſic; and I hope that the obſervations I have made, and the improvements I have in future to ſuggeſt, may be of ſome uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The bulk of mankind are averſe to the ſtudy of phyſic, from the tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical terms, the endleſs multiplication of cauſes, and the numerous uncouth names for diſeaſes and their remedies, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo univerſally; therefore private gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were never remarkable for their knowledge of this art, although they have diſtinguiſhed themſelves often by their deep
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0920100900:9"/>inquiries into law, antiquities, &amp;c. A Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and a Spelman were private gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and no men have been more keen in their reſearches concerning points of law and conſtitutional topics.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore much to be lamented, that men of fortune, rank, and learning, do not bend their minds to inquiries into ſubjects of ſo much importance to mankind as the healing art. The healing art is ſurely the moſt intereſting to our natures of any whatſoever; and yet men of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction and conſequence in general treat it as a department of knowledge beneath their notice<note n="*" place="bottom">There is an exception to this remark in an illuſtrious foreigner, His Serene Highneſs the Prince and Duke de Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, who is not only a profound philoſopher, but a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning phyſician.</note>. The practice of phyſic in
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0920100900:10"/>Great Britain is, at this preſent time, to be conſidered as the reſult of applying Dr. Boerhaave's and Dr. Cullen's principles to practice. Theſe ſyſtems have been moſt compleatly exploded, both as falſe in their principles, and moſt pernicious in their practice<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Brown's works, and an Inquiry into the State of Medicine, upon the principles of inductive philoſophy.</note>. And yet the advocates for theſe ſyſtems of medicine are ſuffered to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer, as it were, over the ſufferings of mankind.</p>
            <p>THE method of treating of nervous fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, of every deſcription, is in a lamentable condition indeed. We hear of thoſe that ſurvive; and the newſpapers inform us of ſome that are dead. We ceaſe to inquire into cauſes, and we ſit down contented
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0920100900:11"/>with viewing of effects. It is, I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſay, owing to the miſmanagement of the fair ſex after laying in, that we hear of the death of ſo many. It is very likely that they may experience a little fever at this time; but ignorance and miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>at this period</hi> is likely to convert it into a nervous, or putrid fever, and death. All mankind experience a pre-diſpoſition to diſeaſes, before they announce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all their formality and terrors<note n="*" place="bottom">The doctrine of <hi>pre-diſpoſition</hi> to diſeaſe is perhaps the moſt important and uſeful department of phyſic. Every man feels the approach of diſeaſe before it comes on, by a variety of different ſymptoms, which are peculiar to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of men. The Gout is known before it makes its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, to thoſe who have been accuſtomed to it, by flatulent complaints in the ſtomach and bowels, accompanied with acid eructations, and apprehenſions and fear of the diſeaſe. The ſame is preciſely the caſe with fevers, and with great numbers of nervous complaints. This is the time that a phyſician has it in his power to exert his ſkill and judgment, and before the diſeaſe makes its formal appearance; therefore a proper know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the doctrine of pre-diſpoſition to diſeaſes, as it is called, is of the greateſt utility in preventing the acceſſion of them. Therefore Dr. Willis, with all deference to this phyſician, was perfectly erroneous in aſſerting, that diſeaſes of the ſame nature with that complaint under which his Majeſty has laboured are liable to relapſes; for the knowledge of a ſtate of pre-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to diſeaſe will qualify a diſcerning phyſician to obſerve the malady at a diſtance, and to prevent the tumult which it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates—relapſes, in theſe caſes, are therefore accounted for. It is natural to ſuppoſe, that his Majeſty will be an invalid for ſome time to come, and that he will be liable to trifling attacks of his diſeaſe. During this period, it would be very adviſable that there ſhould be a phyſician in conſtant attendance, who ought to have nothing elſe to do but to wait on his royal patient, and to obviate every little attack, by proper medicines, diet, &amp;c. This plan will conſtantly enſure his Majeſty a good ſtate of health, and enable him, in a ſhort ſpace of time, to be, from experience alone, his own phyſician.</note>.
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0920100900:12"/>When the diſeaſe takes place, we are not in a condition to help ourſelves, and we therefore are obliged to ſend for the advice of thoſe who are ſuppoſed to be qualified to
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0920100900:13"/>underſtand it. The patient, at this time, is perhaps reſtleſs
<note n="*" place="bottom">From the reports of his Majeſty's phyſicians of the 7th, 8th, and 9th of December, I am ſtill more ſtrengthened in my opinion, that his diſeaſe is neither more nor leſs than a nervous fever. Every man, in all deſcriptions of nervous fevers, is rather incoherent, unleſs they are refreſhed by ſleep. For a want of reſt debilitates the mind and body to a great degree. This is proved by the invigorating effects of ſleep which his Majeſty experienced on the 8th and 9th.

, with a ſevere and heavy feeling in the head, cold chills, with great laſſitude, and full of melancholy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Or he may labour under a delirium, and raging fever. An error at this time is irretrievable; and hence the neceſſity of great judgment, and a nice diſcernment of cauſes, in the phyſician. Bleeding, bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vomiting, and purging, will at this
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0920100900:14"/>time encreaſe the malady, and, eventually, bring on death. The delirium ariſes from a weakened condition of the nervous and vaſcular ſyſtem in general, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the brain. Sudorifics and opiates produce a temporary relief; and it behoves thoſe who adminiſter theſe medicines, to take particular care that the patient is not expoſed to the ſmalleſt degree of cold during their operation, or the delirium will be encreaſed, and all the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe aggravated to an alarming degree.</p>
            <p>I HAVE had the management of a great number of patients labouring under ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous or putrid fevers, and have uniformly been ſucceſsful in the treatment of this
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0920100900:15"/>dangerous diſeaſe. But I have obſerved, and I have abundance of proofs to eſtabliſh my obſervation, that it ſometimes happens, that what is called a ſtate of inſanity, is the conſequence of theſe fevers.</p>
            <p>A CONTINUAL ſtate of delirium will either bring on death, or a conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation in the blood veſſels of the brain, which will <hi>ſine vi a tergo,</hi> admit of more blood within them, than they were, in their vigorous and healthy ſtate, capable of receiving; juſt in the ſame manner that ſevere ſtudy, hard drinking, ſevere vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the application of leeches to eyes which are inflamed through weakneſs, will produce a greater degree of inflammation
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0920100900:16"/>in them, by weakening ſtill more theſe parts<note n="*" place="bottom">There are no diſeaſes more obſtinate in their cure than ſome inflammatory conditions of the eyes. A great number of people loſe their ſight by tampering with their eyes in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The great object of ſurgery is to prevent the amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of legs and arms, by curing of the diſeaſe, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in ſome caſes, is abſolutely neceſſary. But ſurgeons, as well as oculiſts, are too fond of uſing of inſtruments. Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts are not in general ſufficiently qualified to reaſon concerning the cauſes of diſeaſes of the eyes, much leſs of obſtinate opthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias, or inflammations affecting theſe organs; hence ariſes the inveteracy of this diſeaſe. It is therefore probable, that a noble Lord, once high in office, will loſe the uſe of his eyes from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management. For the method of treating theſe inflammations of the eyes, is diametrically oppoſite to the indication of cure. They are, from the inflammatory appearance of the blood veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, conceived to be real inflammatory diſeaſes, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I am ready and willing to prove, is the fact, in nineteen times out of twenty. I have had the management of a great number of patients labouring under this obſtinate complaint, and have been ſucceſsful in curing every individual that has been under my care.
<p>My motive in introducing of this ſubject is only to ſhew, that in caſes of mental derangement, the blood veſſels within the brain are in the preciſe ſituation of debility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation which takes place in the blood veſſels which occupy the anterior parts of the eyes in obſtinate <hi>Opthalmias;</hi> and that to invigorate, by all poſſible means, the whole ſyſtem, and the vaſcular ſyſtem in particular of the parts affected, is the only cure.</p>

            <p>THERE is no affliction more painful to man than the gout; and yet important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries have been made of late, in order to ſhew that it admits of a ſpeedy cure and eaſy management. And I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, from my own experience, that the fear and apprehenſions of what takes place in fits of this diſeaſe, often produces what is called a relapſe. The apprehenſion of the paſt feelings, and pains, generally brings on a renewal of the diſeaſe. And phyſicians ought to be particularly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent their patients from going
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0920100900:18"/>out into the cold in a ſtate of convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Cold applied to the body in this ſtate, and eſpecially at this time of the year, will generally produce a relapſe; and I ſuſpect that his Majeſty has experienced, from this cauſe alone, diſagreeable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and that very lately. In a ſtate of convaleſcence, the mind is always me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and dejected; and whatever weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the body at this time, will, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, bring on a return of the diſeaſe. Exceſſive heat in ſultry weather produces nearly the ſame effects.</p>
            <p>IN this treatiſe I have endeavoured to be as ſhort and as conciſe as poſſible. But in a future publication, which I have in contemplation, I intend to offer my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

            <head>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THERE is not a diſeaſe which aſſumes a greater variety of appearances, nor has given occaſion to the loquacity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided opinions of practitioners of Medicine, than the complaint which has for ſome time paſt afflicted our moſt amiable Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. At one time it is ſuppoſed to be the Gout, at other times the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaſis, and at others a Nervous Fever: nay, it is diſtinguiſhed by almoſt every name which is congenial to the medical dogmas of practitioners of phyſic.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0920100900:21"/>
            <p>IT unfortunately happens to mankind, that the method of living which Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in general obſerve, is likely to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a good ſtate of health; and hence ariſes their implicit faith in books and ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timatical writers. They are therefore ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom harraſſed with thoſe complaints, which ſo conſtantly fall to the lot of ſocial, and convivial ſpirits, which are commonly Fevers, the Rheumatiſm, flatulent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, ſevere nervous Feelings in the Head, and over every part of the body, and the Gout. But while habits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viviality produce theſe effects, the oppoſite extreme, ſuch as abſtinence in wine and animal food, and ſo forth, are attended with preciſely the ſame conſequences, and this ſtate is completely demonſtrated in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deranged condition of his Majeſty's health.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0920100900:22"/>
            <p>I HAVE long been an enemy to Dr. Cullen's practice in general<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note A.</note>; for I have ſeen it ſo often attended with the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conſequences, and more eſpecially in Fevers<note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix to an Inquiry into the State of Medicine.</note>. The natural termination of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is in a ſtate of delirium, and, ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, in death, if a deranged condition of the intellectual powers do not intervene to prevent the diſſolution of nature. This ſtate is called by the name of Madneſs: and if human invention was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to operate this effect, the method now in uſe among practitioners of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is compleatly equal to produce it.</p>
            <p>LET me aſk this queſtion, What is it that produces the diſeaſe known by the name of a nervous, or putrid Fever? Every phyſician, who has a grain of common ſenſe, will anſwer, that it is produced by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0920100900:23"/>debilitating cauſes! But in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine upon theſe cauſes, and to ſpin a web of their own creation, they will inſiſt upon the addition of contagion, effluvia from putrid ſubſtances, exhalations from marſhy grounds, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE penetrating Rouſſeau wiſely ſays, that "ſcience which inſtructs, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which cures, are both undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly very good; but ſcience which deceives, and medicine which kills, are bad. Teach us how to diſcriminate them—there lies the difficulty of the queſtion."</p>
            <p>THERE never was an art more full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception than the practice of phyſic: and this is completely illuſtrated, by the fatal termination of moſt of the diſeaſes which are inflicted by Providence upon mankind. We are, in general, diſpoſed to refer the cauſes of fevers, and other diſeaſes, to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0920100900:24"/>influence of phyſical cauſes alone, and to overlook the operation of moral cauſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together; whereas it can be proved, that moral cauſes are chiefly the forerunners of moſt diſeaſes depending upon debility; and in this ſtate of the body, the application of phyſical cauſes, ſuch as cold applied to it, in a debilitated ſtate, heat, contagion, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid effluvia, and other powers, operating upon ſimilar principles, will more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually produce diſeaſes of this nature; and the effect of theſe powers will be the more compleat, if to theſe are added exceſs of every kind, immoderate indulgence in the paſſions, fatigues of the mind, together with the afflictions and pains which are felt in every condition of mortality, from the monarch to the beggar, and which harrow up, and conſtantly prey upon our minds.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0920100900:25"/>
            <p>A MONARCH is perhaps the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to theſe cauſes. For when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him in the capacity of the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the land, it is natural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he muſt be burdened with cares and apprehenſions, and liable to extreme fatigues, both of body and mind, which are to be always conſidered as the forbod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vouchers of a bad ſtate of health.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"If nature, ſays Rouſſeau, had decreed that we ſhould be ſound in body and mind, I will venture to aſſert, that a ſtate of reflection is a ſtate contrary to nature; and that a man of meditation is a depraved animal. Our misfortunes originate in ourſelves, and that we ſhould have avoided almoſt all of them, if we had followed the ſimple, uniform, retired manner preſcribed to us by nature<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſs Colbrooke's tranſlation of Rouſſeau's thoughts.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0920100900:26"/>
            <p>THESE obſervations, of this profound obſerver of nature, apply with much force and propriety to the ſubject I am about to treat upon. For, as I have obſerved before, we have, from the moſt exalted of ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the moſt humble of human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, our cares and our calamities to ſuſtain. Yet it is natural to ſuppoſe, that the individual who approaches the moſt to the path preſcribed to us by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, experiences the feelings of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and pleaſure, in a more elevated capacity, than the perſonage who, from his ſituation, is conſtantly immured within the walls of ſtudy and reflexion; which is in a continual progreſſion to debilitate the body, and to weaken the ſoul<note n="*" place="bottom">See Note B.</note>. Hence ariſe nervous complaints of all ſorts; ſuch as the hypochondriaſis, epilepſy, palſy, apoplexy, gout, and other diſeaſes of this nature.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0920100900:27"/>
            <p>I HAVE often been aſtoniſhed to hear, that his Majeſty could ſuſtain, (without being precipitated long before this time into a ſtate of diſeaſe,) the weighty, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs, which, like a millſtone, muſt have hung heavy upon his mind, at the ſame time that it was reported, that he eat chiefly of vegetable food, and drank nothing but wine and water. To carry on a train of thought with vigour and effect, or to tranſact buſineſs of conſequence, which is often very diſagreeable to the mind, requires the adventitious aid of ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating food, and cordial liquors, or the diſeaſes I have taken notice of above will eventually take place. And phyſicians, as well as their patients, will be woefully deceived, if they ſuppoſe that either the Cheltenham waters, or the Bath waters, or even thoſe of Spa, will operate wonders,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0920100900:28"/>when the enemy, I mean diſeaſe, has ſtormed the citadel.</p>
            <p>DISEASES, in the commencement of their attacks upon the conſtitution, are but faint reſemblances of what are to happen. But they enliven our ſenſibilities, and our apprehenſions, in proportion to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and our memories are at this time eternally preſenting to us ſcenes in which we have acted a part. Hence philoſophers, as well as moraliſts, are conſtantly declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt thoſe gloomy ideas which hurt their ſolitary hours, and damp their moſt aſpiring thoughts, by exhibiting things in the moſt odious colours imaginable.</p>
            <p>THE cares and anxieties of private indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, as well as of thoſe who are placed in more elevated capacities, inſenſibly bring on diſeaſes, and thoſe of a peculiar nature.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0920100900:29"/>And there are ſometimes ſnares, which even wiſdom and prudence will not prevent our falling into. Although a warrior is often liable to them, a ſtateſman is infinitely more ſo, which the hiſtory of mankind completely proves. Domeſtic anxieties, popular tumults, and national diſaſters, muſt conſtantly aggravate his feelings; and theſe marks of ſenſibility will, ſooner or later, produce nervous diſeaſes. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſtateſmen in general is by no means applicable to the ſituation of the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of his dominions, who has the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual call of his people to the exerciſe of every thing that is wiſe, juſt, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. And when wiſdom, virtue, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and prudence, are diſappointed in their intentions, maladies of a moſt forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſpect too often take place. Therefore the only conſolation we can enjoy when we are afflicted with diſeaſe, is to ſubmit with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0920100900:30"/>patience and philoſophy to the fate of men, and to the decrees of fate. Nay, if a ſtraight waiſtcoat is adviſed by a grave phyſician, as a neceſſary appendage to our miſery, we muſt even ſubmit to this moſt infernal, and brutal uſage. And this act of brutality, I am both free, and bold enough to acknowledge, is the conſequence of employing of thoſe, who are profoundly ignorant of the principles, and philoſophy of the healing art. I have ſaid before, that what is commonly termed madneſs, is brought on by the improper treatment of fevers: for this diſeaſe is no more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary than the Gout, or the ſcrofula, which I have ſhewn, in my treatiſe upon the Gout, to be a diſeaſe depending upon the common cauſes of a relaxed habit. But I need not appeal to a greater authority, than my late learned preceptor, and worthy friend, Dr. Brown, who has had the honour to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0920100900:31"/>explain, with the forcible language of truth, the nature of this diſeaſe, as well as almoſt every other incident to man.</p>
            <p>THIS idea leads me to a digreſſion which I did not intend to make. But as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be of ſome importance to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I intend to offer my opinions, at ſome length, upon the ſubject, as they may be of utility to mankind. I ſhall therefore conſider the ſubject, both as a philoſopher, as well as a phyſician; and I hope that a diſcerning public will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute blame to an intention, which has the benefit of my fellow creatures before me.</p>
            <p>WHEN I viſited the <hi>Biſſetre</hi> at Paris, in the year 1785, I could not forbear exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting my ſenſibilities, and my feelings, at ſeeing ſuch a number of unfortunate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0920100900:32"/>chained down to their ſolitary abodes, without any other cauſe, from what I could learn, than the peculiarity of their conduct, or excentricity of their behaviour. In the courſe of my walk, and obſervations, I came to the cell of an Engliſhman, who had been a captain of a trading veſſel from Dover, and who had been captured by a French priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer in the war before laſt<note n="*" place="bottom">He ſaid that he had been 30 years in conſinement at the <hi>Biſſetre.</hi>
               </note>. I had two Engliſh ladies, a French lady, and a French gentleman in my company; and as ſoon as he found that there were Engliſh in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he ſpoke his mind very freely to us, and told us his ſtory with the moſt perfect diſtinctneſs. His mind was perfectly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and he was much diſpoſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the fervency of it during the time we were in converſation with him; but the police of the place rendered it neceſſary that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0920100900:33"/>we ſhould ſaunter on to another abode of miſery, and quit the manſion of this ſon of misfortune. The pleaſures of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating his ſorrowful tale to his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women and myſelf being thus abruptly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, muſt unqueſtionably have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the feelings of the deſpairing man; and we could hear him, upon our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, break out into all the wild language of fury and deſpair.</p>
            <p>THIS, as well as many other caſes which I could place before my reader, during my ſtay at this place, is a proof that moral cauſes have as great, if not a greater influence, in creating and perpetuating of nervous diſeaſes of all kinds, than phyſical cauſes; and of that diſeaſe, called <hi>mania,</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>THIS leads me, in a natural direction, to conſider the character and important
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0920100900:34"/>truſt generally repoſed by their patients, and the friends and relations of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, in practitioners of phyſic. I have endeavoured to ſhew, in my Inquiry into the State of Medicine, that the education of phyſicians in general has a tendency to lead them to engage in diſputes of words, while they imagine that they are handling controverſies of the deepeſt importance and concern. It was in order to avoid alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations ſo frivolous and endleſs, that the penetrating and learned Dr. John Brown endeavoured to ſtate, with the utmoſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſimplicity, the great <hi>deſiderata</hi> of medicine, and to frame a plan of his own, for the removal of all the obſtacles to the improvement of this noble art. This il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious man ſaw, almoſt intuitively, the cobwebs which hung in ſuſpence the fate of mankind: and if he had not united philoſophy, and profound learning, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0920100900:35"/>with much experience, the healing art might languiſh in its preſent deplorable condition for ages to come.</p>

            <p>To return, however, to my ſubject. Diſeaſes and death are the uniform fate of mortals. The infirmities of life, and the pains of diſeaſe, will naturally obtrude themſelves upon thoſe in exalted ſituations, as well as upon the moſt humble of beings; and in this condition of things it is, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection takes place. In the gay and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing moments of feſtivity and health, the fleeting moments of mirth and diſſipation eraze all thoughts from our minds which are diſagreeable to us<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note D.</note>; and hence amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all ſorts are ſought after by the more wealthy, to ſtifle thoſe ſentiments of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0920100900:37"/>diſappointment, mortification, and chagrin, which muſt, in a greater or leſſer degree, influence all deſcriptions of individuals; but when the cruel hand of diſeaſe renders man a ſolitary animal, it is then that he begins to think of the paſt.</p>
            <p>THERE are no diſeaſes which aſſume a greater variety of appearances than <hi>Agues, Fevers,</hi> and the <hi>Gout.</hi> When the gout flies to the head, it renders the feelings of the patient exquiſitely painful. When the ague viſits the head, the feelings are preciſely the ſame. Nay, in what phyſicians call <hi>nervous fevers,</hi> there is the ſame intermiſſion of diſagreeable ſymptoms which prevails in the gout as well as in intermittent fevers. The patient is utterly at a loſs to explain certain ſymptoms which take place in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents, ſuch as the ſevere and dreadful feelings which rack his head, and put him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0920100900:38"/>in momentary expectation of death. The ſame is preciſely the caſe in the gout. For the ſame appearances of the body, ſuch as extreme languor, melancholy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, a ſtate of deſpair, more or leſs, tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, a ſuſceptibility of what is commonly called catching cold, a propenſity to think in a diſagreeable train of thought, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other ſymptoms of the ſame nature, are obſervable in this diſeaſe alſo. Putrid, or what are termed nervous fevers, diſcover a great reſemblance in their progreſs and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to theſe foregoing diſeaſes, and are alſo to be relieved by a ſimilar treatment.</p>
            <p>BUT the numerous hypotheſis of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians concerning theſe three diſtinct modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of diſeaſes, form inſurmountable barriers to their being treated upon ſimilar principles; and hence the diffuſion of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and unaccountable torpor, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0920100900:39"/>ſo univerſally among practitioners of phyſic, in their treatment of them.</p>
            <p>THERE is no end to the variety of books and diſſertations upon medical ſubjects written by phyſicians. But the influence of the paſſions has been, in almoſt all theſe verbal diſputes and diſſertations, too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heededly paſſed over. <q>"An evil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as barely poſſible, ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces fear; eſpecially if the evil be very great.

The ſmallneſs of the probability is compenſated by the greatneſs of the evil<note n="*" place="bottom">Hume's Eſſays.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE often experienced the truth of this obſervation in my own perſon.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0920100900:40"/>
            <p>THE regulation of the paſſions is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in all nervous diſeaſes, a principal <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratum:</hi> and the phyſician who is not phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher enough to know how and when to apply with ſucceſs his penetration in the regulation of the paſſions, will very ſeldom relieve a nervous diſeaſe, or a diſordered ſtate of the intellect. What is the reaſon that there are ſo many receptacles for what the ignorant world call mad people? I will anſwer very frankly, it is becauſe ſo much ignorance and want of true philoſophy prevail among the generality of phyſicians. It is an abominable diſgrace to Britain, to behold ſuch a number of public, as well as private mad-houſes, as there are in this iſland. When an unfortunate man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have been miſmanaged in a dreadful and alarming diſeaſe, it is propoſed by ſome ignorant or intereſted daemon or other, to ſend the miſerable object of pity and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0920100900:41"/>compaſſion to ſome place of ſecurity, where he has nothing to conſole him but cold, hunger, and ill uſage. It is impoſſible to ſpeak too much at large concerning the diſeaſes brought upon mankind by the all-powerful operation of the paſſion of fear, in its different modifications. Both Mr. Hume, and Rouſſeau, ſpeak of this paſſion, as to its cauſes and effects; and they ſeem to be in ſome meaſure right, ſo far as it produces diſeaſes of the nervous kind, and what are vulgarly called maniacal diſeaſes among the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"A DIBILITATED body," ſays Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, "weakens the ſoul. On this is founded the empire of medicine; an art more pernicious to man than all the ills it pretends to cure. For my own part, I know not of what diſorders phyſicians cure us; but I know this, that they give
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0920100900:42"/>ſome which are very fatal, ſuch as cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, puſillanimity, and the fear of death. If they cure our body, they kill courage. What is the importance of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling carcaſſes to walk? It is man that we want, and we never ſee any come from under their hands<note n="*" place="bottom">See Miſs Colebrook's tranſlation.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ingenious philoſopher was in a great meaſure right in his obſervations. For there is not a doubt, but that the method adopted by phyſicians in former ages, as well as in thoſe of our own times, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of that principle which upholds us in afflictions, as well as in diſeaſe, and that is courage. I do not at all wonder that dramatic writers, ſuch as Moliere, and other authors of ſagacity and penetration, were forward in decyphering the hypocriſy and artifice which predominate ſo much among
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0920100900:43"/>ſome practitioners of medicine. It is quite enough to deſtroy a man's courage, in a ſtate of diſeaſe, to ſee two, three, or more phyſicians, dreſſed in black, with grave countenances, and every affected art which formality itſelf can invent<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note E.</note>.—To depreſſed ſpirits and afflicted minds, ſuch ſymbols of compaſſion and relief hold out no allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to pleaſe and to gratify a diſtempered mind, which requires every ſolacement which virtuous ſenſibility is ever ready to communicate to the unfortunate. The Scriptures ſay, <q>"Bleſſed is the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker;"</q> but how much more bleſſed and happy muſt that man be, who, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge in his profeſſion, aided by that of deep philoſophy, and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the paſſions, knows how to curb them, and when to raiſe them! he muſt ſurely afford the greateſt of comforts to the diſtracted mind, and dibilitated body.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0920100900:44"/>
            <p>WHEN I left the univerſity, I flattered myſelf with the belief, that all diſeaſes were to be cured by medicine and diet. And I have often expreſſed my ſurpriſe, that my attempts in ſome inſtances were ineffectual. But when the patient was dead, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen circumſtance then made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which ſufficiently convinced me, that corroding cares had long preyed upon the mind, and that the heart had bled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſorrows; which has often ſince made me think, that phyſic and phyſicians are but imperfect inſtruments to reſtore to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, conſtitutions worn out with cares and anxiety.</p>
            <p>A POOR man, when reduced in intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and bodily vigour by ill uſage, and the ſophiſtry and empiriciſm which prevail in medicine, is ſent for the remainder of his days to Bedlam, or ſome other manſion of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0920100900:45"/>miſery. The rich man is confined to his own chambers, without one gleam of hope, either to invigorate his body, or comfort his mind. He is deprived of the ſociety of thoſe he loves and reſpects. The amuſements which he had been accuſtomed to are never to refreſhen his waſted ſpirits, or his decayed body; and in this ſolitary and dreadful condition is he to expiate, if he has any, all his errors and his ſins. I would rather, if I had my choice, be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about the country, as Bajazet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Ottomans was, a ſpectacle for fools, and worſe than fools, to look at, than be a priſoner in the predicament I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>WERE I poſſeſſed of all the eloquence of Demoſthenes, Cicero, and Tully, I fear I ſhould be unequal to utter my ſentiments at full length upon this important topic;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0920100900:46"/>becauſe I am well aware, that all diſeaſes, where the vigour of the mind is affected, are the reſult of the paſſion of fear, which is a moſt debilitating paſſion, and is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of almoſt all nervous diſeaſes. There is not a doubt but that it frequently produces convulſive, as well as ſpaſmodic diſeaſes; and I have been a witneſs to its bringing on fits of the gout repeatedly. I have not a doubt in my own mind but that it brings on the hydrophobia, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic diſeaſes, and what phyſicians term mania, or madneſs. And I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that phyſic, as it is generally prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, is the moſt ſuitable of all profeſſions to produce this nervous diſeaſe. If a perſon, in a debilitated ſtate of the body, is bled, bliſtered, vomited, and purged, he will, to a certainty, experience ſome ſevere nervous diſeaſe. But if theſe dibilitating powers are added to the diſeaſe, it is natural
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0920100900:47"/>to ſuppoſe, that death will be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, unleſs what phyſicians call inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity takes place. <q>"But even <hi>impoſſible</hi> evils," ſays Mr. Hume, "cauſe fear; as when we tremble on the brink of a precipice, though we know ourſelves to be in a ſtate of perfect ſecurity, and have it in our choice whether we will advance a ſtep farther. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence of the evil influences the imagination, and produces a ſpecies of belief; but being oppoſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on our ſecurity, the belief is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately retracted, and cauſes <hi>the ſame kind</hi> of paſſion as when, from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of chances, contrary paſſions are produced<note n="*" place="bottom">Hume's Eſſays.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE paſſions produce infinitely greater effects upon the mind when the body is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0920100900:48"/>in a debilitated ſtate, than when it enjoys a healthy and vigorous ſtate, whether this condition of the body ariſes from a too ſpare diet, or from a too voluptuous one. The imagination is infinitely more lively with apprehenſion in relaxed habits, than in vigorous conſtitutions. And hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the great neceſſity of caution, preſence of mind, and minute circumſpection in thoſe who are commiſſioned to attend the ſick. For an error at this time is often ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievable, but more eſpecially when gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the faculty attend patients in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſituations. Their empiriciſm, inſtead of aſſuming the bold and decided practice of Van Helmont, or Paracelſus, now puts on an air of timidity, for fear of what are termed <hi>the conſequences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To contribute, by want of foreſight, or a profound and diſcriminating knowledge
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0920100900:49"/>of diſeaſes, to the death of any department of ſociety, is generally a prelude to their want of buſineſs as phyſicians; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is natural to preſume, that they will exerciſe more than common caution, and indulge in more than uſual timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, when they are to preſcribe for their Sovereign. As fevers are the reſult of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating powers, and conſiſt of debility over every part of the body, but more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the head, it is to be preſumed, that the King's phyſicians abſtained from bleeding, bliſtering, &amp;c. in their late treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him.</p>
            <p>AN unuſual fatality is generally the lot of kings, when they are ſubjected, by either accident or diſeaſe, to the fate preſcribed by nature for man. In his healthy and vigorous ſtate, both of body and mind, he is, as it were, elevated by the exceſſive obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0920100900:50"/>of his courtiers, to a rank infinitely ſuperior to the reſt of mankind.—But obſerve the reverſe! When all-prying diſeaſe commits its havock upon his body, and his mind, then he is reduced to a level with the reſt of mankind, if not to a greater ſtate of mortification, and even humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That nature, in a great meaſure, points to relief, is a rule of infinite impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the healing art, but never attended to as it ought, by thoſe who have the management of the ſick.</p>
            <p>To regulate the mind in all diſeaſes, but more eſpecially in all nervous complaints, is an object of fundamental importance<note n="*" place="bottom">The bite of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> they affirm, is to be cured by muſic; and I do not deny the poſſibility of it in ſome caſes. The bite of the rattle-ſnake, by the ſnake-root; the ague, by the Peruvian bark; the bite of a mad dog, by immerſion in ſea-water, nearly approaching to drowning the patient; the ſyphibilic diſeaſe, by mercury; ſchirrous and cancerated parts, by preparations of hemlock, and ſo forth, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> The efficacy of theſe medicines, and applications, in theſe particular diſeaſes, depend as much in the expectation of relief they afford, as in any ſpecific virtues they are endowed with. I have not a doubt, but that the greateſt number of theſe diſeaſes are brought on through fear, and its effects upon the imagination, and are cured more by exciting of hope, than from any ſpecific virtue of medicine. The death of Dr. Walſh, and that of Dr. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, is to be explained upon the ſame principles. They were no doubt brought up in the belief, that dangerous conſequences muſt reſult from inoculating themſelves with matter from putrid bodies; and I have not a doubt, but the fear ariſing from this belief precipitated them into fevers, and miſmanagement after this into their graves. I have often experienced the effects of contagion in my own perſon; but being regardleſs of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and being confident in my own plan of managing of theſe diſeaſes, I never experienced any bad effects from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</note>.</p>

            <p>TAKE from a man the pleaſures that he has been accuſtomed to, you hurt his peace of mind, and deſtroy for ever his ſweet-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Deprive him of his uſual comforts, and you make him a miſerable and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly being. If a man is fond of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a country life, ſuch as farming, gardening, the ſports of the field, and amuſements of this nature, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his propenſities as a moral agent, you deprive him of the principal comforts
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0920100900:52"/>which this world is capable of affording him. If he is fond of the ſubject of moral philoſophy, natural philoſophy, or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mechanical knowledge, it naturally implies, that a deprivation of theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which are the accompanyments of his ſolitary hours, are equivalent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of his happineſs. And without this celeſtial enjoyment, life, I will venture to ſay, is not worth enjoying.</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHERS have endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the cauſes of ſuicide, but their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have been ineffectual; becauſe no remedy has hitherto been applied to the diſeaſe. Like the laws of the Romans, which were, before the reign of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Juſtinian, an endleſs ſubject of munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ordinances, ſo alſo have been the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and ſpeculations of men, to put a ſtop to this unfortunate failure of courage in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0920100900:53"/>man. It would be an endleſs ſubject to multiply examples of the cruelties exerciſed upon men in one form or the other. Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and philoſophers may preach to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon this ſubject, and never reach at the cauſe. They are as widely at variance with the origin of this unfortunate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, as the greateſt number of phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are in the proper treatment of nervous diſeaſes. Even the elegant admonitions of Rouſſeau make me ſmile when he pretends to ſpeak upon the ſubject, and are to be conſidered as neither more nor leſs than Job's comforters.</p>
            <p>EVERY good and benevolent man is of uſe to ſociety during the period of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: but deprive this virtuous charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by human ordinances, of that pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence which his goodneſs, his charitable inclinations, and his univerſal ſentiments
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0920100900:54"/>of benevolence prompt him to exerciſe; nay, go a ſtep further, ſay that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſane, and then you complete, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the cataſtrophe<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid that Dr. Warren, when examined before the Privy Council, made uſe of the word <hi>inſanity,</hi> as applying to his Majeſty's diſeaſe, and that he was reprimanded by Lord Camden for ſuch an expreſſion. If the Doctor had made uſe of ſuch language, it is impoſſible for any words to be ſufficiently ſevere for the noble earl to make uſe of, to curb ſuch a wanton and unbounded expreſſion of ſpeech. In the inferior conditions of life, the expreſſion alluded to is equivalent to die deſtruction of a man's credit and happineſs for ever. But in the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſituation of a monarch, it not only affects the credit and importance of the nation he governs, but muſt fall upon his offspring; and the more eſpecially, as this diſeaſe is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, without any ground for ſuch a ſuppoſition, to be <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</hi>
                  <p>Dr. Reynolds, upon his examination, ſays, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's complaint may laſt for weeks, months, and years. And I am willing to admit of this prophecy, unleſs a different plan is purſued than that which has been adopted by the learned Doctor's friends and himſelf, which, from all accounts that I have yet been able to learn, muſt encreaſe the malady rather than remove it.</p>
                  <p>When the King went to Cheltenham, I mentioned to my friends, who are ready to prove what I ſaid, that his diſeaſe would be encreaſed, rather than be diminiſhed, by his drinking of the waters of that place. They were by no means ſuitable to remove his diſeaſe, but to encreaſe it. I ſuſpected that a dropſy, inſtead of a fever, would be the reſult of his drinking the Cheltenham waters. If Sir George Baker, or any other phyſician whoſe advice had been called for at that time, had recommended a proper quantity of Madeira, indulgence in animal food, &amp;c. inſtead of ice creams, and vegetable prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he might have the gout in his feet, which would be of infinite ſervice to him, inſtead of a fever, which unfortunately has affected the moſt tender part of the nervous ſyſtem. For my own part, I fee nothing difficult in reſtoring the King to his uſual ſtate of health; and I ſhould experience infinite plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in being inſtrumental in rendering of the ſmalleſt ſervice to ſo virtuous a monarch.</p>

            <p>WE need not wonder that diſeaſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a variety of appearances in different perſons, no more than we wonder at ſeeing different conformations of the body and the face in men and women.

Appearances of diſeaſes are nothing, the cauſes of diſeaſes are the only requisites in the hands of a ſkilful and diſcerning phyſician; and when the cauſes are before him, if he unites phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy with experience, the cure is near at hand in all human diſeaſes.</p>

He ſhould now indulge in animal food, and a proper quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of wine. Muſic, provided it is not too loud, will be of great ſervice in the re-eſtabliſhment of his health. He ſhould refrain from all kind of ſtudy and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unleſs it is of an agreeable nature. He ſhould avoid going out into the air, until the complaint leaves him entirely, otherwiſe the ſmalleſt chillineſs in the air
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0920100900:66"/>will convey it into the head.<note n="*" place="bottom">The evidence of Sir George Baker, before a Committee of the Houſe of Lords, is a compleat illuſtration of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and importance of the late Dr. Brown's doctrines in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and all other nervous diſeaſes, the cauſes of which conſiſt in univerſal relaxation. Phyſicians have been too negligent in obſerving the effects of cold applied to the human body in a ſtate of debility; and there is not an evil of greater magnitude. Marſh Miaſmata, as phyſicians call it, is nothing but cold and moiſture applied to relaxed habits. But neither the eſſluvia ariſing from putrid bodies, nor from bales of goods impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the plague, nor the effects of the Grotto Del Cane, are by any means more dangerous, than the effects which are produced by cold upon relaxed habits. I have experienced, in my own perſon, repeatedly, the effects of what is called contagion; and I have alſo experienced, to a great degree, the effects of cold applied to the body in a relaxed ſtate. But, if I had my choice in a ſtate of debility, I would rather chuſe to be expoſed to the opening of goods from the Levant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the contagion of the plague, than be expoſed to moiſture and cold in the ſame ſituation.
<p>His Majeſty's phyſician ſays, that his royal patient had wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his feet at Windſor, and that he went to St. James's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing his ſtockings. This circumſtance alone, in the King's ſtate of health, was ſufficient to produce alarming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, admitting that no eruption took place, which, from the evidence of this phyſician, was the caſe at the time. The eruption which took place upon the body, was of peculiar uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in tending to remove the diſeaſe. A warm room would have been a proper preſcription at this time. And I am not averſe to the belief, that palſies, apoplexies, and ſudden death, are often the conſequences of going out into the air when the mind is unuſually melancholy, and the body is greatly relaxed.</p>
               </note> His body ought therefore to be kept very warm with flannel cloaths. Soups are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The ſoups he takes ought to be made very rich of animal food, but much condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0920100900:67"/>is not neceſſary in theſe preparations. His requeſts ought to be implicitly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. <q>"FOR the requeſts of kings," ſays Grotius, "have the ſame power as commands; and a denial, how juſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhall be by them as ill digeſted as an injury."</q> It was therefore a moſt cruel act in thoſe who attended his Majeſty, when he ſaw through his window ſome of the princeſſes walk in the garden, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of the pleaſure and ſatisfaction of ſpeaking to his beloved children. I have often, in this work, endeavoured to impreſs upon the minds of my readers, the extreme cruelty of depriving of mankind of their uſual comforts and conſolations in ſome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0920100900:68"/>nervous complaints. And what pleaſure in nature is there equal to the ſeeing, even in a ſtate of health, much more in a ſtate of diſeaſe, of thoſe we are by nature, as well as by habits of mutual love and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, to cheriſh and to admire.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER ſolacement to the mind of the King, is to be derived from reading to him, at proper ſeaſons, thoſe books which uſed to afford him pleaſure when he was in a ſtate of health.</p>
            <p>DR. WILLIS appears, from his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before the Houſe of Commons, to be a very ſenſible and diſcerning phyſician, and ſpeaks of the cauſes which produce his Majeſty's illneſs with perfect diſtinctneſs; ſuch as weighty buſineſs, ſevere exerciſe, extreme abſtemiouſneſs, little reſt, &amp;c. Theſe cauſes, of themſelves, are ſufficient
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0920100900:69"/>to produce a nervous fever, without the co-operation of other powers, tending to produce the ſame effect; ſuch as bleeding, bliſtering, the debilitating operation of James's powders, and other medical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the ſame nature. It appears, however, that the medicines given to his Majeſty ſince Dr. Willis has been called in, have been attended with beneficial conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: And I am naturally led to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, from the advantages which have hitherto reſulted from them, that they muſt have partaken of opium, which, if adminiſtered with judgment and caution, and ſupported in their efficacy by invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating food, and proper vinous cordials, are qualified to produce the moſt happy conſequences. The very reverſe is the caſe with this medicine when injudiciouſly made uſe of, which very often happens.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0920100900:70"/>
            <p>I BEG leave to ſubmit one more thought upon this ſubject. It appears that his Majeſty had experienced conſiderable relief, during the progreſs of his illneſs, in uſing the warm bath; and I can venture to ſpeak with certainty, that the effects of the warm bath are prodigiouſly increaſed, by being impregnated with the Peruvian bark, and aromatic herbs of all ſorts. The only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of cure is therefore to invigorate, by all poſſible means, the body, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford every conſolation to the mind. This plan ought to be ſtudied with much aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity by thoſe who attend his Majeſty. For whatever produces an encreaſe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily relaxation, will, to a certainty, bring on a renewal of his diſeaſe.</p>
