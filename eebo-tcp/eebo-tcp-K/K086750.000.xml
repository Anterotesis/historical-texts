            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <note n="c" place="bottom">2 Chron. xxix. 30.</note> commanded the Levites to make uſe of, with thoſe of <hi>David,</hi> in the Houſe of the Lord. — He was fully ſenſible
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0410701500:6"/>that the Obedience God requires from Men is that of the Heart — The Sacrifice of their Wills; far more pleaſing to him than Incenſe or

               <hi>the Fat of the Rams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the Reaſon of this is evident: For, if a Man reflects, He will find, that his Will is that alone which he can properly call his own, and therefore the only Sacrifice he can offer unto the Almighty. To offer unto him Burnt-offerings,
<note n="e" place="bottom">Pſal.</note>

If I be hungry I will not tell thee, for the whole World is mine, and all that is therein.

            </p>
            <p>NOTHING but ſupine Indolence, and the utmoſt Indifference to Things of a ſpiritual Nature, can make this Duty ſo neglected
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0410701500:7"/>among Men, and ſuffer the Goodneſs of God to paſs away with ſo little Regard. The Mercies which he is pleaſed, each Day to confer upon us, ſeem to have no other Effect (with the Generality I mean) that to make us confident of a Succeſſion of them the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day: No other Effect, than to aſſiſt us in flattering ourſelves, that we are the peculiar People of God; and to teach us to preſume, that he, who hath ever been mindful of us, will ever continue to be ſo. — Yet this is not the Whole of the Caſe — For it is obſervable that thoſe Perſons, who are ſo unmindful of the Bleſſings of God, who permit ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Inſtances of his Mercy to ſlip out of their Minds, without any Mention, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of them, are the firſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and murmur, if an Accident diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points their Schemes and Deſigns, or any thing falls out contrary to their Wiſhes and Inclinations. — Surely, this is a moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Indication what Strangers we are to God, and the Ways of his Providence; and how wholly our Minds are buſied and delighted with the Affairs of this World!</p>
            <p>A SIGNAL Act indeed of Mercy, a Mark of God's ſpecial Providence will raiſe in many Men a ſudden Spirit of Gratitude; a certain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0410701500:8"/>Warmth, and Eagerneſs to give Praiſe unto God. — But ſoon does that Spirit ſubſide. — Variety of Diverſions and Hurry of Buſineſs quickly damp that Fire, and introduce Luke-warmneſs and Indifference. — But if the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing receiv'd be remembered for a Time; it is often remembered in wanton Gratitude, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by unſeemly Mirth and Jollity, and moſt frequently ending in Exceſs and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. — So evident is that Truth; That if the common and daily Mercies of God cannot awaken in us a Spirit of Gratitude, neither ſhall we be perſuaded to a conſtant Practice of this Duty, tho' the moſt extraordinary Act of Mercy were wrought in that Behalf.</p>
            <p>THANKSGIVING is diſtinguiſh'd from Praiſe as it is a more confin'd Duty; or rather a Part of that general one. — It has reſpect to thoſe Bleſſings and Mercies which concern ourſelves; whereas Praiſe terminates in God, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his own great, and infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>THANKSGIVING conſiſts in a grateful Senſe of any Mercy we have receiv'd from God; expreſs'd by ſuch outward Signs as are moſt agreeable to our Joy — It implies not only a preſent Acknowledgment of his Favours, but ſuch a conſtant Remembrance of them,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0410701500:9"/>that no worldly Honours, or Succeſs can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, or blot out of our Minds. — Moreover, it includes a due Reflection on thoſe Favours, and requires, that we ſet a juſt Value on them; omitting no Circumſtance that may heighten their Excellence — But this Duty is beſt expreſs'd when the Mercies of God excite in us a Love and Reverence of his Name, and an hearty Deſire, and ſincere Endeavour to preſent ourſelves

               <hi>a living Sacrifice holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEREIN conſiſts the Duty of Thankſgiving — How reaſonable an one it is, every Man muſt at once confeſs, when he conſiders to whom it is to be paid — To him who firſt gave and ſtill continues our Being — To him who hath created all Things in Heaven and Earth for our Comfort and Convenience —

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0410701500:10"/>ſo much as think how to ſecure ourſelves, or any thing belonging to us — Who is ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to call us his Friends, and under that endearing Relation, to admit us to a free In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with himſelf; permitting us to call him Father, and to make known our Requeſts unto him, by Prayer and Supplication — Who with an Eye of Pity beholds our Sorrows, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves our Wants, aſſiſts our Infirmities, and ſends us Strength and Patience to ſupport our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Tryals and Afflictions. — But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, who hath ſent his only begotten Son, from his own right Hand, into the World, to take upon him our Nature, and its Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; to die in our ſtead, and by his Death to make us Inheritors of Life and Glory; and who, when, through our manifold Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we provoke him to Wrath, at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of his Son, does ſtill forgive us, and ſuffers not his Diſpleaſure to ariſe.</p>
            <p>THERE is one Circumſtance which muſt greatly recommend this Duty to us, and that is, its Excellence. — We cannot pay a more acceptable Service to our Lord than Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: A ſervice which, of all others, he is moſt delighted with: Nay, which he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diſtinguiſh in a very peculiar manner;

               <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſ. l. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſo offereth me Thanks and Praiſe he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth me.</hi> Honoureth God? — How em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically does this Expreſſion ſet forth the Excellence of Thankſgiving, and graciouſly encourage us in the Performance of the Duty? Let it not then be termed a mercenary one; let it not be conſtrued to proceed from Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſince there cannot be that Principle in any Man's Heart, who makes the utmoſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he is able, for a Benefit receiv'd.— No, Selfiſhneſs is the Parent of Ingratitude; a Sin moſt unpardonable in us, and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable in the Sight of God. But Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proceeds from another Principle; a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love deriv'd to us from the Fountain of Love, God himſelf.— It is not an Addreſs of Intereſt, a Petition to him for more Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; 'tis an humble Acknowledgment of his excellent Mercy and Goodneſs, in what he has already beſtowed.</p>
            <p>THE Reaſons and Occaſions of the Duty, muſt, of neceſſity, make it a pleaſant one: Becauſe the Recollection of every Mercy is a kind of ſecond Enjoyment. We are aſſur'd by one who was very converſant in it, that,
<note n="i" place="bottom">Ib. cxlvii 1.</note> 
               <hi>it is a joyful and pleaſant Thing to be thankful.</hi> It muſt beſides adminiſter great Delight to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0410701500:12"/>the Mind, as it enlarges its Powers, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it from low and trifling Objects, which darken and debaſe it, to that great and noble one, the Divine Being.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the Nature, Reaſonableneſs and Excellence of Thankſgiving; a Duty requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, and incumbent upon all ſince all have taſted of the Mercies of God.</p>
            <p>THE ſame Obligations which affect every Individual, for the particular Inſtances of Kindneſs ſhewn to him, will reſpectively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all Communities and Bodies of Men, and conſequently all States, and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſs'd by ourſelves, and all others who are acquainted with our Hiſtory, that this Nation has experienced the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Marks of the Divine Favour; has been moſt ſignally and wonderfully preſerv'd, in Times, both of the greateſt Danger, and moſt extreme Neceſſity.—The God of Hoſts has often gone out with us to Battle. —</p>

            <p>THIS is a Mercy, not which our Fathers have told us; but which we do now ſee and hear; and which loudly calls for our moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Thanks to the Author: And with them our further Prayers that he would be pleas'd to continue to us his Favours, and to preſerve that Great Man, Who, truly ſollicitous for the public Good, left his Eaſe and Retirement, to enter upon a painful and hazardous Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; Who departed not in the Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but with an Heart full of Courage, and Reſolution, equalled only by his Prudence, and Moderation: In Whoſe generous, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Breaſt the Love of his Country appears to be the governing Principle, and Who ſeems to rejoice, that it hath pleaſed God to make him the Inſtrument of recovering its juſt Rights; of chaſtiſing a faithleſs and inſolent Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">After two rigorous Winter Seaſons (the firſt of which was very remarkable) and a long exceſſive Drought, when our old Stores were greatly exhauſted, and a moſt melancholly Proſpect before us, it pleaſed God to ſend a great Rain, which was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and has produced one of the moſt plentiful Harveſts, ever known in this Kingdom.</note> ANOTHER Mercy, for which we, at this Time, ſtand obliged to our Gracious Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is that glorious Proſpect of the Fruits of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0410701500:14"/>the Earth, ſpringing up to ſupply our preſent great Neceſſity; the Effect only of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<note n="l" place="bottom">Pſ. lxviii. 9.</note> 
               <hi>who ſent a gracious Rain on his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and refreſhed it when it was weary.</hi> Theſe are Bleſſings which we are now ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and which require our ſincereſt Thanks to the boutiful Giver; Whom, with all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, we are to wait on for a Continuance of theſe Mercies; truſting that he will finiſh what he hath begun, that he will preſerve us in our Dangers abroad, and our Neceſſities at home, that he will both
<note n="m" place="bottom">Ib. exlvii. 14.</note> 
               <hi>make Peace in our Borders, and alſo fill us with the Flour of Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE beſt Method by which we can moſt reaſonably hope to ſee our Deſires anſwer'd, to behold the Completion of theſe Bleſſings, is gratefully to acknowledge thoſe Inſtances of the Divine Goodneſs, which were ſhewn to us heretofore. — Of theſe, none more deſerves our beſt and heartieſt Thanks, than the great Deliverance of this Day: Which, it is to be hop'd, will be had in Remembrance, as long as that Conſtitution ſhall laſt which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh'd by it.</p>
            <p>To remember this Mercy is not the Work of the Lips, but of the Heart. — It is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0410701500:15"/>with Seriouſneſs upon it; to learn how to value it; and to look into every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that may help to ſhew us the true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of it.—It is to draw ſuch Inferences from it that may direct our Practice, and aſſiſt us in the ſeveral Duties of Life.—To entertain from thence juſt Notions of the Relations we bear to each other, and of the Obligations ariſing from ſuch Relations. — Particularly, To learn from thence Obedience to the King, and all that are put in Authority under him: To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to preſerve the Peace and good Order of the Community in which we live: To ſhew good Offices to our Friends and Neighbours, and to bear a good Will towards all Men; To reſtrain every inordinate and turbulent Paſſion in our Minds that may incline us to change, or lead us beyond the Bounds of Equity, Truth, and Reaſon. — Above all, To love and fear, and honour him who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and to frequent the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of that Church, which his Providence hath eſtabliſhed in theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>THE Bleſſing, which we, this Day, ſtand ſo greatly indebted to Almighty God for, is
<q>The having put an end to the great Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion by the Reſtitution of the King, and Royal Family, and the Reſtauration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, after many Year's Interruption.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0410701500:16"/>To be ſenſible of the great Value of this Bleſſing we need only look into the Hiſtory of that time, and reflect on the Anarchy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that then overſpread the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>WHEN that Form of Government, which was ſo agreeable to the Temper, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the People, and which was prov'd, by the Experience of many Ages, to be the beſt Method of preſerving to them their Rights, and Privileges, nay, which the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per himſelf confeſs'd to be the beſt Method of governing, by inſtituting ſomething of the like Kind, I ſay, when that excellent Form of Government was deſtroyed, no Wonder that Diſorder was the Conſequence; when

               <hi>there was no King in this our</hi> Iſrael, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Amazement, that <hi>every Man did that which was right in his own Eyes.</hi> — After that Effuſion of noble Blood, and the black un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Murder of the beſt of Kings, how ſoon did Oppreſſion ſpread its dark Wings over this unhappy Nation! How ſoon were thoſe deluded Men, that were blindly led on by falſe and miſchievous Guides, made ſenſible of their Error! And how quickly did they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that That Liberty, which they thirſted after, even unto Blood, was only made a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Pretence to reduce them to the moſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0410701500:17"/>abject Slavery!—Thus being groſly deceiv'd, and, by the moſt ſcandalous and falſe Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, urged on, through the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable means, to ſeek Freedom, did they plunge themſelves into the very Gulph of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; and, madly ſtriving to depoſe one that was imaginary, ſuffer'd themſelves to be evil entreated by many real Tyrants.—What En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Injuſtice and Bitterneſs of Heart was there in every Society! What Malice, Jealouſy, and Suſpicion! What Schemes and Deſigns! What Plotting and Contrivance! Each Faction, by all the Methods and Arts that the moſt fiery Zeal could ſuggeſt, ſtriving for the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Profeſſing Sincerity, Meekneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Full of Pride, Rage, and Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—For how was the ſacred Name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then proſtituted, and the Honour and Service of God made a Cloak to palliate the moſt enormous Crimes; made the Means not only of practiſing, but juſtifying the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Inſtances of Oppreſſion and Cruelty?— Surely, more flagrant Hypocriſy, carried to greater Heights, and attended with ſtronger Aggravations, never yet appear'd in the World!

The Treachery of ſome compell'd him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his Thoughts to his own Boſom; as the Avarice, and Rapine of others, oblig'd him to conceal his Subſtance where it was moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſecur'd. — How grievous an Heart-breaking muſt it have been to him; to Every Man of old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Principles, firſt to behold a Prince, of ſo much Goodneſs, rudely ſeiz'd on, and inhumanly murder'd by his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; Then to ſee his Son, and the reſt of the royal Iſſue, in their tender Years, drove from the Kingdom; The pureſt Chriſtian Church overthrown, and trampled on; and private Property no better ſecured than by Faction, and Opinion!</p>
            <p>IN this miſerable Situation of Affairs, ſome Attempts were made towards a Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but without Succeſs. Alas!

               <hi>ſuffer men to ride over our Heads,</hi> but, at laſt, <hi>brought us out into a wealthy Place:</hi> Who, in our Troubles and Adverſities, did turn and refreſh us; who remember'd us in our low Eſtate, and turned away the Captivity of his People.—Is there any one then, among this People, that will refuſe to pay to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, his annual Tribute of Praiſe and Thankſgiving for ſo wonderful a Bleſſing? — The Man in whom the Return of this Day does not create Joy, and raiſe a Spirit of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0410701500:20"/>would have look'd upon the Confuſion, that preceded the Reſtoration, with Pleaſure and Complacency: And what a Friend to his Country, ſuch an one is like to prove, the meaneſt Capacity may judge.— Every Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we enjoy, every new Acquiſition we make, every thing that is dear to us, more eſpecially our Religion and Liberties, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us from thence.—To be inſenſible therefore of this Bleſſing, were to act moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly indeed, were to indicate that we are even Enemies to our own ſelves.</p>
            <p>HE, whoſe licentious Tongue, inſtructed and directed by a wicked Heart, can rail at, object againſt, and vilify the truly happy Day we are now remembring, ſhould conſider (if nothing elſe can ſtop his Virulence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction) that he is obliged to that Day's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for the very Freedom of Speech he is pleas'd ſo intemperately to make uſe of.</p>
            <p>I KNOW not how far Men may be carried by their Humours and Paſſions; How far an Affectation of Singularity may incline ſome, how far a Spirit of Party may compel others, and how far Indifference and the Diſtance of Time may be a Cauſe in more, of omitting this their Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving; but this may be ſaid with ſome Degree of Aſſurance, That no one, who has
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0410701500:21"/>a due Regard for the Honour and Dignity of the Crown, a tender Concern and temperate Zeal for the Eſtabliſhed Church, and an Heart glowing with the Love of Liberty, that no one can, conſiſtently with theſe Principles, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his Duty on this Day, and be blameleſs. — If a Man will be ſearching for Excuſes, the only poſſible Method, by which he can requit himſelf in this Caſe, is to doubt the Truth of the Fact: A Scheme, which may not ſeem ſo full of Abſurdity, if Scepticiſm in Hiſtory be as flagrant as it is in Religion.</p>
            <p>— Neither do I ſee with what Reaſon any one can inſinuate himſelf into another's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by Miſrepreſentations of the important Tranſaction of that Day, and by depreciating the Character of the King, then reſtor'd. With Men of honeſt and generous Principles, it has ever been held a Mark of a mean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to commend one Man by aſperſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How much more then is it a ſign of baſe Servitude, to extol one Prince (whoſe Virtues are too well known to need ſuch low Helps) at the Expence of debaſing another, who wore the ſame Crown before him! It amounts to more than a Suppoſition, that he, who can be guilty of ſuch Behaviour, would, at a fit Opportunity, and under favourable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, turn a vile Traitor, and even whet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0410701500:22"/>his Sword againſt the Gracious Sovereign now ſet over us. As it is our Duty to pay the greateſt Reverence to his ſacred Perſon, ſo let the Memory of the other be ever dear unto us: Of Him, who, as on this Day, return'd to his Kingdom, with the univerſal Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his People, rejoicing with one Heart and united Hands, to ſee their antient, their beſt Conſtitution reſtor'd; to behold, once again, the glorious Face of Monarchy, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and Liberty.</p>
            <p>IT has pleaſed God, out of his abundant Mercy, to prolong the Lives of ſome Perſons, who were Eye-witneſſes of that happy Day, even to theſe Times. But had we no living Evidence of it, were the Diſtance of Time much greater than it is, yet a Mercy ſo ſignal, and ſo excellent, can never be forgotten by us. We cannot, without Forfeiture of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, omit religiouſly obſerving a Day, the joyful Effects of which we are every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſenſible of. More eſpecially in this great and renown'd City, which the reſt of the Kingdom ſeem ſo induſtrious to copy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let this Day be ever held ſacred. It were to degenerate from the Spirit of our Anceſtors not to acknowledge that Work with Joy, which they were ſo ſollicitous about, and which, under the Direction of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0410701500:23"/>they were ſo remarkably inſtrumental in bringing to paſs.</p>
            <p>I WOULD uſe one Word more of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which is, That we take care to inſtil into thoſe that come after, the ſame Senſe of this Mercy, the ſame Spirit of Gratitude, which we ourſelves feel;
