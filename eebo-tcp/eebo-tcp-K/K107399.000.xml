            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Minds of Youth, like their bodily Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, require to be fed with ſome ſuitable Entertainment; the moſt pleaſing Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wont to cloy by long and frequent Uſe. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory is an inexhauſtible Subject, which will furniſh them with a boundleſs Variety of Things, fit to exerciſe their inquiſitive Minds. And I cannot help thinking, that to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Youth in reading this Subject, muſt be of real Benefit, both now and hereafter. It will introduce them into a habit of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from their natural Propenſity to view the Pictures, read the Names, and Hiſtory of the Creatures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which all ſeem delighted with. But the great and chief Service it will be to them hereafter, is bringing them acquainted with the <hi>GREAT CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR</hi> of all theſe Things, by contemplating his ſtupendious Works: It will afford a delightful Satisfaction, to ſearch into Nature, to trace
<pb facs="tcp:0377400900:4"/>her Footſteps, and the various Methods ſhe takes to bring her Works to Perfection. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it cannot be expected, that Children can underſtand theſe Things, or be able to make a right Uſe of them: But by tuition, Perſons of the loweſt Capacity may be made to know, <hi>That the Lord made the earth by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſdom, and ſtretched out the heaven by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> Jer. <hi>li. 15.</hi> And that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed the Earth whereon we dwell, with variety of Plants, Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome for Uſe, ſome for Ornament, and ſome for Delight; which give daily demonſtration of the Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs of the Maker and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of all theſe Things.</p>
                  <p>A new Study ſeems at firſt to ſome Perſons hard, intricate, and difficult; but after a little reſolution and progreſs; after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a little acquainted with it, their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are wonderfully cleared up and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, the Difficulties vaniſh, and the Thing grows eaſy, familiar, and pleaſant. And ſure I am; ſuch ſtudies as theſe are vaſtly ſuperior to the Tales, Fables, and Stories of Love, uſed in Schools, and deſerve the regard of Parents and Teachers; as conducing more to the Honour of God, and the real Benefit of Youth. And for our Encouragement in this Study, obſerve what the Pſalmiſt ſaith; <hi>The works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein,</hi> Pſal. <hi>cxi. 2.</hi> Which though it is principally ſpoken of the Works of Providence, yet may as well he verified of the Works of the Creation.</p>

                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S a kind of WILD GOAT bred in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which is call'd, in <hi>Latin, Capricerva;</hi> becauſe they partake of the Deer and Goat. The Inhabitants other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe call them BEZOAR, from whence the Name of <hi>Bezoar</hi> ariſes. This Animal is very nimble, ſo that he will skip from Rock to Rock. and is dangerous to the Hunter; for he will defend himſelf, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kills the <hi>Indians</hi> that purſue him. The Head of this Creature reſembles that of the He-goat. The Horns are very black; and are bended almoſt to his Back. The Body is covered with an aſh-colour'd Hair, inclining to red, much ſhorter than that of the Goat, and neareſt to the Deer's. The Tail is ſhort, and turns up again: The Legs are pretty thick; and the Feet are cleft, like thoſe of the Goat. <hi>Bezoar</hi> is a Stone, produced in ſeveral Parts of the Belly of this Goat. It is taken, likewiſe, out of the Bellies of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other Animals in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> It is found in Balls of different ſizes and ſhapes; for ſome are as big
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0377400900:7"/>as a Wall-nut; others as a Hazel-nut, (this ſort, they ſay, is taken from a kind of <hi>Ape,</hi> that is found parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in a certain Iſland of <hi>America</hi>) and ſome as a large Pea. Some are round, others oval, flat, or bunch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Superfices of all the ſorts are ſmooth, poliſh'd, ſhining, of an olive or grey Colour; and is made uſe of in Medicine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fig. 2.</hi> The MUSK-GOAT is of the ſhape and colour of a Hind, only it has a longer Body: It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Kingdoms of <hi>Boutan, Tunquin,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Parts of <hi>Aſia.</hi> It frequents the Woods and Foreſts, where they hunt it; and when it is kill'd, they cut out the Bladder, or Pouch, as big as a Hen's Egg, which is found under the Belly; then they ſeparate the coagulated Blood, which they dry in the Sun, and reduce to a kind of light Moſs, almoſt powder'd, of a dark reddiſh Colour. This acquires a ſtrong diſagreeable ſmell. They then wrap it up in Bladders for Tranſportation. And this is the Musk we uſe. There are a prodigious number of Animals that yield Musk, chiefly in the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan.</hi> They catch them uſually at Spring-time, or in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Summer: For after they have been almoſt ſtarv'd, during the Winter, becauſe of the Snows, that fall in thoſe Countries ten or twelve foot deep, they come to ſeek for Food; their Blood being then in a great heat, and violent fermentation. The Musk then taken is likewiſe ſtrong and ſpirituous, which is the reaſon they do not expoſe it for ſome time to dry in the Air, leſt it ſhould quite deſtroy the ſmell. They cannot take a great deal of Musk from any one of theſe, Animals, becauſe they have but one Cod a piece, which does not yield above three Drams of Musk dry'd. They ſay, that the Bag, during the rutting of this Creature, has an Abſeeſs form'd in it; which when fully ripe, it makes the Beaſt itch, and rub himſelf againſt Stones, Rocks, and Stumps of Trees, till he breaks it; and it is this Corruption, that when it is ſpilt and dry'd in the Sun, becomes Musk. There is no impoſſibility in this Story; but yet it is not to be thought, that all she Musk we have, is taken from theſe Abſceſſes. For,

                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. The SHAMOY, or ROCK-GOAT, is a wild Goat no bigger than the common Kind, which frequents the Rocks and high Hills; as the <hi>Alps, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees,</hi> &amp;c. The Horns of this Animal are odly turn'd, for they riſe upright firſt, and then wind forward like a Hook: It feeds upon the Plants that grows on the Sands, and tops of the Rocks. 'Tis a very ſhy and timorous Creature: It is coated like a Faun, having a ſtreak running all along the Back. There is a great Trade carried on with theſe <hi>Shamoy</hi> Skins; by which they convey Oil, Wine, and other Liquids, out of the mountainous Countries; and of which they make ſeveral other Uſes: for theſe <hi>Shamoy</hi> Skins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreſſed, are converted into Gloves, Breeches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe they may be waſhed as Linnen is, and likewiſe be dyed into what curious Colour you pleaſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Bladder of theſe Creatures is found a Stone, which is call'd <hi>German Bezoar,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Germans</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem this not inferior in Virtue to the Oriental <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar.</hi> The volatile Salt and Oil, of which theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both Male and Female, afford abundance; are eſteem'd of very excellent Uſe in Phyſick.</p>

They leave 'em thus expoſed to the Weather ſeveral Days, then take them in and tan 'em; and when they are dreſſed, export them. This Skin is very hard when dry, and ſoft when ſteep'd in Water. It is ſaid, that what makes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0377400900:11"/>this Skin ſo hard, is becauſe the Animal ſits down, and reſts very much on his Buttocks. They bring two Sorts of Shagreen from <hi>Turkey, viz.</hi> the grey, or aſh-colour'd, which is the beſt; and the white, or ſalted Shagreen. The Uſe of this Shagreen is very univerſal for all ſorts of Pocket Utenſils, Watch Caſes, Toys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They may dye theſe Skins what Colour they pleaſe; but the moſt common are black, green, and red. The moſt beautiful and deareſt, is the red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, becauſe of the Vermilion and Carmine with which it is dyed. Shagreen Skin is often counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited in Work.</p>

His Horns are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtraight from his Head up, tapering gradually, with Rings like a Screw, till within an Inch and an half of the top. It has fine large black Eyes; a long and ſlender Neck, Feet, and Legs. There are many of theſe Creatures in an Herd; when at the ſame time they have Scouts, who by running give them Notice of an approaching Foe. They are taken by ſhot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being too ſwift for a Greyhound. The Antelope in ſhape and beauty excels moſt of the four-footed Race. This Creature is deſcribed in the <hi>Book of Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Animals;</hi> but the Figure there being very faulty, nothing like the Antelope; and having ſince an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a true Draught taken from the Creature itſelf; I hope giving it double will be excuſed.</p>

Many of theſe little Creatures are to be found about the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> They are about half a Foot long, and an Inch diameter, having a ſharp Noſe, cover'd with Scales. It has two little piercing Eyes. The Mouth is divided, reaching to the place where the Ears ſhould be ſeated, had this Creature any. It has a great many little white and red Teeth: It goes upon four Feet, little more than an Inch long, which

It is a Beaſt that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates much of the ſubtle and miſchievous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Apes and Baboons; but much more bold and fierce.

It is of a yellowiſh brown Colour, but its under part is of a whitiſh Colour. When ſhe goes out to ſeek for Food, her young Ones run about her; which, when they are full, or in danger, or for wearineſs, immediately mount upon their Mother's Back, and twiſt their Tails round the Tail of the old one, who forthwith carries them into her Hole.</p>

Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail, was fourteen Inches; breadth, when the Wings were expanded, twenty one Inches; its weight nine Ounces: Its Bill was three Inches long, ſlender, black, flat or depreſſed, reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which is peculiar to this Bird, ending in a very thin, ſlender, weak point; the Tongue is ſhort, not cloven; the Head of a mean ſize, round like a Ball, and black above the Eyes; the Colour of the whole under Side of the Body was white, and the upper ſide partly white and partly black, or dark brown; its Legs are very long, of a lovely blue Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, bare above the Knees, and the Claws black and little; it hath a back Toe, but a very ſmall one. Mr. <hi>Albin</hi> ſays, he had this Bird from <hi>Newgate-Market;</hi> it was brought to that Place with other Wild-fowl.</p>

The BEARD-MANICA, or BEARDED-TITMOUSE, is in length from the tip of the Bill, to the end of the Tail, about ſix Inches and an half; in breadth, when the Wings are extended, ten Inches and a half; in weight nine Drams and a half: The Bill is ſhort, thick, and of a yellowiſh Colour, (in the Hen dusky.) The Head is of a dark aſh Colour; from the Eyes a Tuft of black Feathers hangs down, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a point, repreſenting a picked Beard, from which Mark it has the Name of <hi>Beard-manica.</hi> The Back, upper part of the Wings, and lower part of the Belly, and Tail, are brown; under the Chin white; the Breaſt, Belly, and Thighs, of a pale yellowiſh white, with a tincture of brown; the Legs and Feet black. This Bird is very ſingular in the care and love which he ſhews to the Hen; when at Rooſt, he covers her all Night with his Wing. The Hen is ſomething ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than the Cock, and of a more beautiful yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh brown; the Wings and Legs of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with thoſe of the Cock: The Hen is without the Beard, and more pale on the Breaſt.—They are found in the Salt-Marſhes in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and likewiſe in the Fens in <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi>

The JACOBINE-PIGEON, or as it is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call'd for ſhortneſs, the JACK, is, if true, the ſmalleſt of all Pigeons, and the ſmaller ſtill the better: It has a range of Feathers inverted quite over the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Head, and reaching down on each ſide of the Neck to the Shoulders of the Wings, which forms a kind of a Fryar's Hood: From hence this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon has its name <hi>Jacobine,</hi> becauſe the Fathers of that Order all wear Hoods to cover their bald crowns; hence the upper part of this range of Feathers is call'd the Hood: and the more compact theſe Feathers are, and the cloſer to the Head, ſo much the more this Bird is eſteem'd. The lower part of this range of Feathers is call'd by us, the <hi>Chain,</hi> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> calls it the <hi>Cravat;</hi> the Feathers of this Chain ought to be long and cloſe, ſo that if you ſtrain the Neck a little, by taking hold of the Bill, the two ſides will lap over each other in ſome of the beſt; but there are very few

As for their Colour, there are reds, yellows, blues, blacks, and mottles; but be the Colour of the Feathers what they will, they ought to have a clean white Head, white Feet, and white Tail. Of theſe Pigeons, ſome are fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-legg'd and footed, others are not, and both ſorts are equally eſteem'd, according to the various Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of different Fancies.</p>

The FRIGAT Bird, which the <hi>Indians</hi> call ſo, becauſe of the ſwiftneſs of its flight; has a Body no bigger than a Pullet's, but its Stomach is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fleſhy: The Males are as black as Ravens. The Neck is pretty long, the Head ſmall, with two great black Eyes, and the Sight more piercing than the Eagle's; The Bill is likewiſe pretty thick, and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly black, about ſix or ſeven Inches long; the upper Beak is crook'd like a Hook: The Claws are very ſhort, and divided as the Vulture's. The Wings of this Bird are very large, and not without a provident deſign of Nature, ſince his Wings are ſometimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to carry him above a hundred Leagues from Land. It is with a great deal of Trouble, that this Bird can raiſe himſelf upon the Branches, becauſe of the extraordinary length of his Wings; but when he has once taken his flight, he keeps his Wings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended almoſt without any Motion or Fatigue. If ſometimes the weight of the Rain, or the violence of the Winds, force him, he mounts above the Clouds, beyond Sight, in the middle Region of the Air; and when he is at the higheſt, he does not forget where-about he is, but remembers the place where the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado,</hi> or gold Fiſh, gives chace to the flying Fiſh, and then he throws himſelf down like Lightning; not ſo as to ſtrike upon the Water, for then it would be difficult for him to riſe again; but when he comes within twelve or fourteen Paces, he makes a large turn, and lowering himſelf, as it were inſenſibly, till he comes to skim the Waters where the Chace is given; in paſſing, he takes up the little Fiſh, either with his Bill, or his Talons, and ſometimes both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0377400900:23"/>He has a great red Comb, like that of the Cock, not upon his Head, but under the Throat; and this Comb does not appear but in the old ones; The Females have none; the Feathers are whiter than thoſe of the Males, eſpecially under the Belly. Theſe Birds, for a long time, made a little Iſland their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; in like manner, as the Rooks have a Rooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where all of that Species thereabout, come to rooſt at Nights, and build their Neſt in the proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This little Iſland was called the <hi>Iſle of Frigats,</hi> and bears the Name to this Day, tho' the Birds have left the Place; for in the Year 1643, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Year, ſeveral People chas'd them ſo ſeverely, that they were forc'd to forſake the Iſle. Father <hi>du Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> Apoſtolical Miſſionary in the <hi>Antillees,</hi> mov'd by the large Commendations give of the Oil drawn from theſe Fowls, with the Aſſiſtance of two or three more Perſons, took above one hundred of them in leſs than two hours time. They ſurpriz'd the old ones upon the Branches of the Trees, or in the Neſts; and as they riſe with a great deal of Difficulty to take Wing, it was an eaſy matter to beat them down with long Sticks. The Oil, or Fat of theſe Birds, is a ſovereign Remedy for <hi>Sciatica</hi> Pains; and for all others proceeding from a cold Cauſe: It is held in great eſteem throughout all the <hi>Indies,</hi> as a precious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>

The Little HORN-OWl is in weight about ten Ounces; its length from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail, fourteen Inches; its breadth, when the Wings are extended, three Feet four Inches; its Bill black, and a little above an Inch long; the Tongue fleſhy and a little divided; the Face is encompaſſed with a double row of Feathers, the outer row variegated with ſmall white, black, and red Lines; the inner row, under the Eyes, reddiſh. Its Horns were above an Inch long, of a yellowiſh white, with ſix indented tranſverſe Lines of black; and in ſhape reſembling the Ears of a Cat. The whole Bird was cover'd with a delicate Plume, beautifully varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with white, black, red, yellow and brown Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. The Legs of this Owl were feather'd down to the Feet, and of a light brown Colour; the Claws black.

The ſhape of the Body approacheth to that of a Plover: The Head is adorned with a moſt beautiful Creſt two Inches high, conſiſting of a double row of Feathers, reaching from the Bill to the Nape of the Neck, all along the top of the Head; which it can at pleaſure ſet up and let fall; it is made up of twenty-four Feathers, ſome of which are longer than others; the tips of them are black, under the black they are white, the remaining part under the white being of a cheſnut inclining to yellow; the Neck is of a pale reddiſh yellow; the Breaſt white.</p>

A Cock Bird of this kind was ſhot near <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire.</hi> Theſe Birds are not very common in <hi>England;</hi> but about <hi>Cologn,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>High Germany</hi> are frequent, where they call them <hi>Widehuppe:</hi> They ſit for the moſt part on the Ground, ſometimes on Willows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They feed like <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> on Beetles and other Inſects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 14. The FLAMMANT was in length, from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Claws, four Feet ten Inches and a half; in breadth, when the Wings were extended, four Feet; the Legs ſixteen Inches from the Knee to the end of the middle Claw; its Bill five Inches and a quarter long, of a ſingular ſhape; the upper Mandible is flat and broad, crooked and toothed; the lower thicker than the upper; the tip black, in the young Birds of a dark blue. It is two Years before this Bird arrives to its perfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; at which time it is entirely red, except the prime Feathers of the Wings, which are black when it is at its full bigneſs: its weight is about two Pounds and a half; its Legs are long, and of a red Colour, bare of Feathers a good way above the Knees; the Toes webb'd together; the Claws black. Theſe Birds make their Neſts on Hillocks, in ſhallow Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on which they ſit with their Legs extended down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. They breed on the Coaſt of <hi>Cuba</hi> and the <hi>Bahama</hi> Iſlands, and frequent the ſalt Water; a Man by concealing himſelf from their ſight, may kill great Numbers of them, for they will not riſe at the Report of a Gun; neither is the ſight of thoſe killed cloſe by them, ſufficient to terrify the reſt, and warn them of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0377400900:35"/>the Danger; but they ſtand gazing, and as it were aſtoniſhed, till they are moſt or all of them killed. When they feed (which is always in ſhallow Water) by bending their Neck, they lay the upper part of their Bill next the Ground, their Feet being in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion up and down in the Mud; by which they raiſe a ſmall round ſort of Seed or Grain, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Millet, which they receive into their Bill; and as there is a neceſſity of admitting into their Mouths ſome Mud, Nature has provided the edges of their Bill with fine Teeth like thoſe of a Comb, with which they retain the Food, and reject the Mud that is taken in with it. They are thought by ſome to feed on Fiſh likewiſe. This Figure was taken from the Bird itſelf by Mr. <hi>Albin:</hi> It was brought from Sir <hi>Robert Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole</hi>'s, where it had been kept alive in the Kitchen ſome time.</p>

It was kept at <hi>Richmond</hi> Palace, when Her preſent Majeſty was Princeſs of <hi>Wales,</hi> amongſt her Collection of Rarities of this kind. Mr. <hi>Albin</hi> drew the Figure from the Bird itſelf, but could not meet with any one to inform him from what Country it was brought, nor to anſwer ſome other Queſtions he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ask concerning it. Excepting in the Colour, it is pretty much like the <hi>Caraſow</hi> Hen, and about the ſame bigneſs; its Head likewiſe is furniſh'd with a beautiful Creſt, very much reſembling the Creſt of that Bird; and indeed it ſeems to be of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with that Fowl: The Diſagreement that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, may perhaps be only owing to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Places they are brought from, or ſuch Difference as is common amongſt tame Fowls. The outer edges all round the Creſt was black; the lower part of the Creſt next the Head, and part of the Neck, was of a lead Colour; all the reſt of the Bird, a fine red, only the Wings and Tail ſomewhat darker than the Body; and the Legs and Feet black.</p>

                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 18. The GANSER may be claſſed with thoſe of the Gooſe-kind, the Bill and Feet being like theirs; the top and back part of the Head, Breaſt, Belly, and Thighs were of a pale yellowiſh buff-colour, with a light tincture of reddiſh brown, here and there in Spots, excepting a large Spot of reddiſh brown on the middle of the Breaſt: The Bill was red, flat, and toothed like that of the Gooſe: The fore-part of the Head round the Eyes reddiſh brown, with a ring of the ſame Colour round the upper part of the Neck,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0377400900:39"/>joining to the Head: The back part of the Head and Back were of a reddiſh brown Colour: The Tail ſhort and black. It was web-footed, its Legs very long, and bare above Knee, both Legs and Feet of a red Colour. Its Food was the ſame with that of Geeſe, eating Graſs and Corn. The Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cock and Hen could not be diſtinguiſhed, either by the Colours or Shape, but only by the Cock's running to the Hen with open Wings, claſping or embracing her round with them.</p>

The whole Bird is black, except the upper part of the Wings, which is a bright ſcarlet, under that a yellow: The Legs, Feet and Claws are black. This Bird was ſhot near <hi>London;</hi> it was thought to be a Cage Bird, which had bot looſe: In its Gizzard was found Grubs, Beetles, and ſmall Maggots. It is a Native of <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> in which Countries they are very numerous. Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> makes mention of its flying in Companies with the Purple-Daws, and deſtroying the Corn wherever they come, being the moſt deſtructive Birds in thoſe Countries. He ſays it makes its Neſt over the Water amongſt Reeds and Sedges, the tops of which they interweave ſo artfully, making an Arch or Covering, under which they hang their Neſt, (after the manner of the Reed Sparrow) and ſo ſecure from wet, that where the Tide flows it is obſerved never to reach them. It is a very active and familiar Bird, and when kept in a Cage will learn to imitate human Speech.</p>

Upon the top of the Head of this Bird, grew certain ſhafts or ſtalks, bearing little round Balls on their tops, like thoſe of an Earl's Coronet, of a yellowiſh Colour: On the fore-part of the Head, a little above the Bill, it has a ſmall red Comb, and two red Marks on each ſide of the Head. The Bill is ſhort, thick, ſtrong, a little bowed; and of a pale yellow Colour. This Bird is found in the <hi>Eaſt Indies.</hi>

The LONG-TAIL HUMMING-BIRD is the leaſt of all the Species of this Kind of Birds, of which Naturaliſts reckon nine different ſorts, and the leaſt that we know of found upon our Globe. Its length from the beginning of the Head, or Inſertion of the Bill, to the riſe of the Tail, is two Inches and a half; that is, the Neck one Inch, and the Body an Inch and a half long: the Head ſmall; the Bill a little more than an Inch long, black, round, ſharp and almoſt ſtraight. The Legs and Feet like thoſe of the reſt; the Feathers alſo of the Body and Wings are alike diſpoſed, but differently coloured: It hath a Tail lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than any of the reſt, ſomewhat more than three Inches, conſiſting of Feathers, of which that which is nearer to its riſe is ſhorter, the ſecond always longer. The Tail is forked, and the Bird in flying ſpreads it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0377400900:43"/>into two large Horns, ſo that the tips of the Horns are an Inch and an half diſtant from each other. The whole Head and Neck of this Bird is of a ſhining ſilken black Colour, inclining to or interchanging with blue, as in the Necks of Mallards; the whole Back and Breaſt are green, ſhining interchangeably with golden and ſea-green, as in the ſecond kind of theſe Birds. The Wings are of a liver-colour; the Tail of of a blackiſh blue, ſhining like poliſhed Steel blued over. There are ſo great a variety of beautiful Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, in the Feathers of all the Kinds of theſe Birds; and ſo wonderfully reſplendent, that they cannot be well repreſented by any Painter: The <hi>Indians</hi> make of theſe Feathers the Repreſentations of Saints, and other things, ſo dextrouſly and artificially, to the Life, that one would think they were drawn with a Pencil in Colours. Theſe Birds are fed and nouriſhed with Honey, Dew, and the Juice of Flowers, which they ſuck out of them with their Bill, or rather very long Tongue, provided and fitted by Nature for that Uſe; ſo that being taken alive, they cannot be kept for want of Food, but die in a ſhort time.</p>

The BATT, or FLUTTER-MOUSE, is a Creature between a Bird and a Beaſt, of which there are three Kinds that we know of, <hi>viz.</hi> the common ſort, frequent in <hi>England;</hi> another ſort about one fourth bigger than the common, with Ears twiſted like <hi>Rams</hi> Horns, about an Inch and a half in meaſure; and a third kind brought to us from the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> whoſe Body is as large as a Rat, and the Wings being extended, meaſure from point to point above two Feet. In theſe Creatures there is no remarkable difference, but the ſize of their Parts. Theſe Animals partake of the four-footed Kind in the Make of the Head, which agrees very much with thoſe of the Mouſe or Rat kind; the ſhape of the Trunk of their Bodies likewiſe is much the ſame, and are both cover'd with Hair: They alſo bring forth their young ones perfectly formed, like the four-footed kind, and give them ſuck. They par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Bird kind in having only two Legs, beſides the Hooks at the pinions of their Wings; they have alſo the Power of flying. The Note or Voice of theſe Animals is between the chirping of Birds, and the cry of four-footed Beaſts. Theſe Creatures have not long Tails, like Animals with four Feet. It is ſaid, the <hi>Batt</hi> ſleeps all the Winter in Holes of old Houſes and Walls; it very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears in the Day-time, but flies in the dusk of the Evening only. The Wings of a <hi>Batt</hi> are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſtrange, conſiſting of one entire Skin, webb'd together ſomewhat like the Feet of Water-Fowl. The Claws or Hooks on the tops of the Wings, this Creature makes uſe of to hang by to any thing it is minded; whilſt it is either feeding, ſleeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It feeds on Bacon, Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Deſcription of this Creature would more properly have come in between the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Birds;</hi> but being omitted there, I choſe to place it here rather than leave it out.</p>

The Head and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is cover'd all over with ſmall Scales of a yellow Colour, the Back ſomewhat darker than the Belly and Sides. It has five Fins, a long prickly one on the Back, two under the Belly, and one on each ſide behind the Gills: The Head is large, the Mouth wide, in the under Jaw a double row of ſmall Teeth; in the upper are three large Teeth, with ſome very ſmall ones within the Roof of the Mouth: It has a brisk lively Eye encircled with red.</p>

It has a large-prickly Fin on the Back, reaching from the Head almoſt to the Tail; two on the Belly, one large like that on the Back, and a long ſlender one towards the Head: The Tail is large, and ſpreads very wide, both ſides ſhooting into ſharp Points; and as it wants Teeth, Nature has ſupplied that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency by arming the Tail on each ſide with a ſtrong ſharp-pointed Bone, which in defence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he extends when Danger approaches. This Weapon, with its prickly Fins, ſeem to deter the voracious Kind that prey on others, from attacking him. Yet I have ſeen (ſays Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi>) a <hi>Barra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuda</hi> purſue and bite off a third part of him behind; which when he had ſwallowed, he deliberately bit off half the remaining part, and devoured the whole Fiſh at the third Mouthful.

It is about three or four Inches in legnth, and ſo called, becauſe he is clothed and armed with a foreign Shell. Theſe Creatures go down ſometimes to the Sea-Coaſt; but whether it is to waſh, and to caſt their Eggs, as the Land-Crabs do, is not known; but this is certain, that they go to change their Shells, which every one endeavours to find out according to his ſize: and finding what may fit'em, they run themſelves back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards therein, and ſo cloath themſelves anew: and being arm'd like Soldiers with theſe foreign Shells, they march up again to the Woods, and take up their Quarters among hollow Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rotten Leaves, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where increaſing in Bulk, and the Shell becoming too ſtraight for them, they are obliged to go down to the Sea-Coaſts to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0377400900:103"/>change their Houſes again. The Curious, who have made Obſervations of what happens during this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, have own'd, they took a great deal of Pleaſure in the ſight; for theſe Creatures ſtop at every Shell they meet with, conſider it diligently, and having met with one they like, immediately quit the old one, and run themſelves ſo ſwiftly backwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, that one would think they were either afraid of the Injury of the cold Air, or aſham'd to to be ſeen naked; and if two of them meet at the ſame time ſtripp'd, to enter into one and the ſame Shell, they will bite each other, and battle it, till ſuch time as the weaker yields, and quits the Shell to the Conqueror; who having cloath'd himſelf with it, takes three or four turns upon the Shore, and if he finds it does not fit him, quits it again, and has immediate recourſe to his old one, and then ſeeks out for another; and thus they will change five or ſix times, till they meet with one for their Purpoſe. They carry in their Shells about half a Spoonful of clear Water, which is a ſovereign Remedy againſt the Puſtles and Bliſters that the wet which drops from the <hi>Manchineel</hi> Tree raiſes upon the Skin.</p>

Are the Male and Female <hi>Moth-Flies,</hi> from whence the <hi>Silk-Worm</hi> is produced, which are hatch'd from an Egg of the bigneſs of a Muſtard-ſeed. The SILK-WORM, <hi>Fig.</hi> 7. is of a pale cream-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour inclining to white. During this Form it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly undergoes four Sickneſſes, each laſting about three Days, wherein it feeds not at all, but grows thicker, ſhorter and clearer, and at each Sickneſs changes its Skin. It after changes from that of a Worm to an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi> or <hi>Chryſalis, Fig.</hi> 8. whereunto it is transformed after its ſpinning time; in which State it lies ſhut up in hot Countries for fourteen or fifteen Days, in more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ones eighteen or twenty Days, without any Food known to us: during which time this Inſect leaves two Skins, both that of a Worm when it is changed into an <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and that of an <hi>Aurelia</hi> when it becomes a <hi>Moth</hi> in its Silk-caſe. Its laſt Transformation is from an <hi>Aurelia</hi> to a <hi>Moth,</hi> which eats its way out thro' the ſharp end of the Caſe, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. by a Hole juſt big enough to creep thro'. This laſt Change into a Moth-Fly is the Perfection of this Inſect.

Theſe Monks, when they returned, told the Emperor, That the Silk was produced by a living Creature, a Worm, which could not be brought ſo long a Journey alive. But underſtanding from them that its Eggs might be brought; from which the Creatures might be propagated; He ſent them back a ſecond time, to bring him of thoſe Eggs: Who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effected what they went about, brought to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> great Quantities, which they preſented to the Emperor in great State on Horſeback, (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd by many of his Nobles, Senators and Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates) enclos'd in a Roll or Horn of Paper, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions how to breed, nouriſh, and draw Silk from the ſaid Creatures: which was received with great Applauſe and Admiration; and from thoſe Eggs have been propagated all the <hi>Silk-Worms,</hi> and their Silk in <hi>Europe.</hi>

When the Worms have fed their full time, and are ready to ſpin their Silk, roll up white Paper like a Wafer, theſe pin up againſt the Hangings of a Room, or to Lines tied croſs the Room; in theſe Papers put every ſingle Worm, as you perceive it wants to ſpin, which it will begin to do generally as ſoon as it is put into the Paper. When the Worm has finiſhed its Caſe, and changed into an <hi>Aurelia,</hi> which is known by hearing it rattle, when it is ſhaken at the Ear. Then proceed to wind off the Silk, never ſuffering the Moth-Fly to eat its way out of the Caſe, not even of thoſe that are deſigned to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0377400900:113"/>propagate Seed for the next Year. A Gentleman very curious in his Obſervations and Experiments upon the <hi>Silk-Worm,</hi> his Method in winding off the Silk is, as ſoon as the Worms have finiſhed their Bottoms, and changed into <hi>Aurelias,</hi> to put the Bottoms into warm Water, with ſome Spirit of Wine in it, which he ſays facilitates the winding off the Silk very much; the Ends he finds more readily, and winds them on a Card in his Hand, without any Reel or Machine at all: And as the Silk-Bottoms are wound off, he takes the <hi>Aurelia</hi> of each, and places them in one of thoſe clean Paper-Pans, erect upon the piqued end; and when its time is accompliſhed, to enter upon its laſt Transformation of a Moth-Fly, it will aſſume its new State, as well as if it had continued the whole time in its Silk-Caſe; and this Method is practiſed by divers other Perſons, who wind off the Silk after the ſame manner. When the Silk-Moths are come out of their Caſes, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly transformed, and are put into ſuch Paper Drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Pans, or Troughs, as they are bred in, there they will couple and lay their Eggs: When that is over, the Papers with the Eggs upon them (never attempt to take the Eggs off) are to be put into a Cheſt or Trunk one upon another, among wollen Cloths; and without any other Art or Means, there let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till the next Spring. Some Ladies who keep <hi>Silk-Worms,</hi> beſides the Pleaſure they take in feeding and obſerving theſe wonderful Creatures, make uſe of the Silk-Caſe, which they cut (after the outer Sleave or Down is off) into artificial Flowers to wear in their Heads, which they themſelves paint and colour, to imitate Nature.</p>

                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 27. Is a <hi>Spider</hi> very remarkable for its Legs and Feelers; each Joint of the former appears as if it were plac'd in a Socket; the latter were globular and hairy; and on the outer ſide of each, there was a bright knob of white, incircled with yellow, which made it look as if a little Stone had been ſet therein. It had eight Eyes, ſtanding as they are placed over the <hi>Spider</hi> in the Plate. This is a Male Spider, and was taken in a Houſe in the Month of <hi>April:</hi> Its Colour was black where the Eyes ſtood; the other part adjoining to the Belly was of a reddiſh cheſnut; the upper ſide of the Belly of a yellowiſh dark aſh Colour; and the Legs of a reddiſh Colour.</p>

The ſmall <hi>Long-legg'd Spider</hi> was ſo fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mark'd, that it is impoſſible to deſcribe it, either in Words or Colours; there being ſo fine a Mixture of green, red, and black interchangeably put together in pretty Shapes; the Legs were alſo curiouſly mark'd in the ſame manner: The Eyes were ſo ſmall as not to be diſcerned. It was taken on the Body-of a Tree in <hi>Cane-Wood,</hi> about the middle of <hi>April.</hi>

Its Legs were finely ſpotted with black, and from each Joint grew certain Hairs or Briſtles: Its Feelers were long and ſlender.

                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 31. Is one of the <hi>Jumping-Spiders:</hi> It had eight Eyes placed in a circular form, as over the Head of the Spider in the Plate; and it is obſervable that all the Spiders that have their Eyes ſtanding in that form, catch their Prey by jumping on it, like a Cat at a Mouſe. It is a Creature extreamly nimble in moving any way it pleaſes: 'twas taken in a Garden. If you look on it with a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> it appears one of the moſt beautiful Spiders, that can poſſibly be ſeen; there is ſo great a Variety of Marbling, in pretty Figures of ſeveral Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> black, cheſnut, red. diſh, and white mix'd all over the Back, Belly, Legs and Feelers, as not to be expreſſed. It ſeems to the naked Eye to be a greyiſh ſpeckled Spider, being all over rough and hairy. The late ingenious Dr. <hi>Hooke,</hi> in his <hi>Micrography,</hi> gives the following diverting Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this particular Spider; as obſerv'd by the moſt accompliſh'd Mr. <hi>Evelyn,</hi> in his Travels in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0377400900:130"/>Of all the ſorts of Inſects, <hi>ſays he,</hi> there is none has afforded me more Diverſion than the ſmall grey <hi>Jumping-Spider,</hi> prettily beſpeck'd with black Spots all over the Body, which the Microſcope diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to be a kind of a Feathers like thoſe on But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies Wings, or the Body of the white Moth. It is very nimble by Fits, ſometimes running, and ſometimes leaping, like a Graſhopper, then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, and ſetting itſelf on its hinder Legs, will very nimbly turn its Body, and look round it ſelf every way. Such, ſays Mr. <hi>Evelin,</hi> I did frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve at <hi>Rome,</hi> which eſpying a Fly at three or four Yards diſtance, upon the Balcony where I ſtood, would not make directly to her, but crawl under the Rail, till being arriv'd right under her, it would ſteal up, ſeldom miſſing its Aim: but if it chanced to want any thing of being perfectly oppoſite, would, at firſt Peep, immediately ſlide down again, till taking better notice, it would come the next time exactly upon the Fly's Back: but, if this happen'd not to be within a competent Leap, then would this Inſect move ſo ſoftly, as the very Shadow of the Dial ſeem'd not to be more imperceptible, unleſs the Fly mov'd; and then wou'd the Spider move alſo in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, keeping that juſt Time with her Motion, as if the ſame Soul had animated both thoſe little Bodies; and whether it were forwards, backwards, or to either ſide, without at all turning her Body, like a well-managed Horſe: But if the capricious Fly took wing, and pitch'd upon another Place behind our Huntreſs, then would the Spider whirle its Body ſo nimbly about, as nothing could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd more ſwift; by which means, ſhe always kept
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0377400900:131"/>the Head towards her Prey, tho' to appearance as immovable, as if it had been a Nail driven into the Wood, till by that indiſcernible progreſs, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd within the Sphere of her reach, ſhe made a fatal Leap (ſwift as Lightning) upon the Fly, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the Pole, where ſhe never quitted hold till her Belly was full, and then carried the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder home. I have beheld them inſtructing their young ones how to hunt, which they would ſometimes diſcipline for not well obſerving; but when any of the old ones did miſs a Leap, they would run out of the Field, and hide themſelves in their Crannies, as aſham'd, and not be ſeen abroad for four or five Hours after: for ſo long have I watched the Nature of of this ſtrange Inſect, the Contemplation of whoſe ſo wonderful Sagacity and Addreſs has amaz'd me; nor do I find in any Chaſe whatſoever, more Cunning and Stratagem obſerv'd. I have found ſome of theſe Spiders in my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when the Weather towards the Spring is very hot, but they are nothing ſo eager of Hunting as they are in <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Spider Fig.</hi> 32. was beautifully ſtreaked, and ſpeckled with black all over its Body and Legs.

                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 36. The <hi>Carter,</hi> or <hi>Long-legg'd Spider,</hi> for two Particularities has very few Creatures like it; the firſt, which is diſcoverable only by the Microſcope, is the curious Contrivance of his Eyes, of which he has only two, and thoſe placed upon the top of a ſmall Pillar or Hillock, riſing out of the middle of the top of its Back, or rather the Crown of its Head; for they were fixed on the very top of this Pillar, placed back to back, with the tranſparent Parts, or Pupils, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards either ſide, but ſomewhat more forward than backwards. Theſe Eyes, to appearance, ſeem'd to be of the very ſame Structure with that of larger two-ey'd Creatures, ſeeming to have a very ſmooth and very protuberant Cornea, and in the midſt of it to have a very black Puple, incompaſſed about with a kind of grey <hi>Iris.</hi> Whether it were able to move theſe Eyes to and fro, I have not obſerv'd; but 'tis not very likely he ſhould, the Pillar or Neck ſeeming
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0377400900:134"/>to be cover'd and ſtiffen'd with a cruſty Shell; but Nature, in all probability, has ſupply'd that Defect, by making the Cornea ſo very protuberant, and ſetting it ſo clear above the ſhadowing or obſtructing of its Proſpect by the Body, that 'tis likely each Eye may perceive, though not ſee diſtinctly, almoſt an Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere; whence having ſo ſmall and round a Body, placed upon ſuch long Legs, it is quickly able ſo to wind, and turn it, as to ſee any thing diſtinct. This Creature, as do all other <hi>Spiders,</hi> differs very much from moſt Inſects in the Figure of its Eyes; for the beſt Microſcope does not diſcover its Eyes to be any ways knobb'd or pearl'd, like thoſe of other Infects. The ſecond Peculiarity which is obvious to the Eye, is alſo very remarkable, and that is the prodigious length of its Legs, in proportion to its ſmall round Body, and which are jointed, juſt like thoſe of a Crab, but every of the Parts are ſpun out prodigiouſly lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in proportion; each of theſe Legs are terminated in a ſmall Caſe or Shell, ſhap'd almoſt like that of a Muſcle-ſhell, faſten'd to the Body in ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a manner, as does not a little manifeſt the Wiſdom of Nature in the Contrivance; for theſe long Leavers (as I may ſo call them) of the Legs, having not the advantage of a long end on the other ſide of the <hi>Hypomochlion,</hi> or Centers, on which part of the Legs move, muſt neceſſarily require a vaſt Strength to move them, and keep the Body balanc'd and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, inſomuch, that if we ſhould ſuppoſe a Man's Body ſuſpended by ſuch a Contrivance, an hundred and fifty times the ſtrength of a Man would not keep the Body from falling on the Breaſt. To ſupply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore each of theſe Legs with its proper ſtrength, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has allow'd to each a large Cheſt or Cell, in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0377400900:135"/>which is included a very large and ſtrong Muſcle; and thereby this little Animal is not only able to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend its Body upon leſs than theſe eight, but to move it very ſwiftly over the tops of Graſs and Leaves. This Creature ſeems to throw its Body upon the Prey, not unlike a Jumping-Spider. The whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, when view'd by the Microſcope, appear'd a very pretty one; and could it have been diſſected, as many Singularities might have been found within it as without; perhaps, for the moſt part, not unlike the Parts of a Crab, which this little Creature does in many things very much reſemble. I omit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Horns, of the Mouth which ſeem'd like that of a Crabs; the Speckledneſs of his Shell, which proceeded from a kind of Feathers, or Hairs, and the hairineſs of his Legs, his large Thorax and little Belly, and the like, and ſhall only take notice, that the three Parts of the Body, namely the Head, Breaſt and Belly, are in this Creature ſtrangely confus'd, ſo that 'tis difficult to determine which is which, as they are alſo in a Crab; and indeed, this ſeems to be nothing elſe but an <hi>Air-Crab,</hi> being made more light and nimble, proportionable to the Medium wherein it reſides; and as Air ſeems to have but one thouſandth part of the Body of Water, ſo does this Spider ſeem not to be a thouſandth part of the Bulk of a Crab.</p>
                     <p>All kinds of <hi>Spiders</hi> ſeem to be Creatures of Prey, and to feed on other ſmall Infects; but their ways of catching them are very different: The <hi>Shepherd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> by running on his Prey; the <hi>Jumping Spider</hi> by leaping on it, other ſorts weave Nets, or Cobwebs, whereby they inſnare them; Nature having both fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with Materials and Tools, and taught them
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0377400900:136"/>how to work and weave their Nets, and lie perdue, and to watch diligently to run on a Fly as ſoon as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Foot of a Spider</hi> is of an admirable and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Mechaniſm, whereby he is able to ſpin, weave, and climb, or run on his curious tranſparent Clue. Mr. <hi>Albin,</hi> in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory of Spiders,</hi> juſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, has collected near <hi>Two Hundred</hi> different ſorts of theſe Infects. Their Thread or Web ſeems to be ſpun out of ſome viſcous kind of Excrement, lying in their Belly; which, tho' ſoft when drawn out, is preſently, by reaſon of its ſmallneſs, harden'd and dried by the ambient Air.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 37. IS the TARANTULA from <hi>Baglivi; Fig.</hi> 38. from the Natural <hi>Spider</hi> in Sir <hi>Hans Sloan</hi>'s Collection. This Infect is a Spider of <hi>Apulia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> of the eight-ey'd Kind, and ſpins Webs: It has eight Legs, four on each ſide, and in each Leg three Joints; from the Mouth proceed two Darts, in ſhape juſt like to a Crab's Claws; theſe are ſolid, and very ſharp, ſo that they can eaſily pierce the Skin; and between thoſe and the fore Legs there are two little Horns, or Feelers; which it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to move very briskly when it approaches to its Prey.</p>
                     <p>This, as other Spiders do, propagates its Species by laying Eggs, which are very numerous; ſo that there are found ſometimes in the Female, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected,

In the Summer Months, eſpecially when the Heats are greateſt, as in the Dog-days, the <hi>Tarantula</hi> creeping among the Corn in the Fields, bites the Mowers and Paſſengers. In the Winter it lurks in Holes, and is ſcarcely ſeen; and if it does bite then, it is not veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, neither does it induce any ill Symptoms. But in the hot Weather, altho' the Pain of its Bite is at firſt no greater than what is cauſed by the Sting of a Bee, yet the Part quickly after is diſcoloured with a livid, black, or yellowiſh Circle, and raiſed to an inflam'd Swelling; the Patient within a few Hours is ſeized with a violent Sickneſs, Difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, univerſal Faintneſs, and ſometimes Trembling, with a Weakneſs of the Head; being asked what the Ail is, makes no Reply, or with a querulous Voice and melancholy Look, points to his Breaſt, as if the Heart was moſt affected.</p>
                     <p>During this mournful Scene, all the uſual Medicines apply'd to venomous Bites, and Cordials, are of no ſervice; for, notwithſtanding their repeated uſe, the Patient growing by degrees more melancholy, ſtupid, and ſtrangely timorous, in a ſhort time expires; unleſs Muſick be called to his aſſiſtance, which alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Medicine, performs the Cure. For, at the firſt Sound of the Muſical Inſtrument, altho' the Sick lie, as it were, in an Apoplectick Fit, they begin by degrees to move their Hands and Feet, till at laſt they get up, and fall to dancing with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Vigour, at firſt for three or four Hours; then they are put to Bed, refreſhed from their Sweating, for a ſhort time, and repeat the Exerciſe with the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0377400900:139"/>ſame Vehemence, perceiving no Wearineſs or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from it, but profeſſing they grow ſtronger and nimbler the more they dance.</p>
                     <p>At this ſport they uſually ſpend twelve Hours a Day, and it continues three or four Days; by which time they are generally freed from all their Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which do nevertheleſs attack 'em again about the ſame time the next Year; and if they do not take care to prevent this Relapſe by Muſick, they fall into a Jaundice, want of Appetite, univerſal Weakneſs, and ſuch like Diſeaſes; which are every Year increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if Dancing be neglected, till at laſt they prove incurable. As Muſick is the common Cure, ſo they who are bitten are pleas'd, ſome with one ſort of it, ſome with another; one is rais'd with a Pipe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Timbrel; one with a Harp, another with a Fiddle; ſo that the Muſicians make ſometimes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eſſays before they can accommodate their Art to the Venom; but this is conſtant and certain, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Variety, that they all require the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and briskeſt Tunes, and are never moved by a ſlow, dull Harmony.</p>
                     <p>While the Perſons affected are Dancing, they loſe in a manner the uſe of all their Senſes; like ſo many Drunkards, do many ridiculous and fooliſh Tricks; talk and act obſcenely and rudely; take great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in playing with Vine-Leaves, with naked Swords, and red Cloths, and the like; and on the other hand can't bear the ſight of any thing black; ſo that if any By-ſtander happen to appear in that Colour, he muſt immediately withdraw, or otherwiſe they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into their Symptoms with as much Violence as ever.</p>

The <hi>Ant, ſays he,</hi> is of a dark brown, or reddiſh Colour, with long Legs, on the hinder of which it would ſtand up, and raiſe its Head as high as it could above the Ground, that it might ſtare the further about it, juſt after the ſame manner as the <hi>Hunting-Spider</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to do: and putting my Finger towards them,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0377400900:142"/>they have at firſt all run towards it, till almoſt at it; and then they would ſtand round about it, at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtance, and ſmell, as it were, and conſider whether they ſhould any of them venture any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; till one more bold than the reſt venturing to climb it, all the reſt, if I would have ſuffered them, would have immediately followed: Many ſuch other ſeemingly rational Actions I have obſerv'd in this little Vermin, with much Pleaſure. I have obſerv'd a very large Kind, that inhabited under the Roots of a Tree, from whence they would ſally out in great Parties, and make moſt grievous Havock of the Flowers and Fruits, in the ambient Garden, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back again very expertly, by the ſame Ways and Paths they went. It has a large Head, at the upper end of which were two protuberant Eyes, pear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d like thoſe of a Fly, but ſmaller: Out of the Noſe, or foremoſt Part, iſſued two Horns, differing from thoſe of a blue Fly, though indeed they ſeem to be both the ſame kind of Organ, and to ſerve for a kind of Smelling: Beyond theſe were two indented Jaws, which he open'd ſideways, and was able to gape them aſunder very wide; and the ends of them being arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Teeth, which meeting went between each other, it was able to graſp and hold an heavy Body, three or four times the Bulk and Weight of its own Body. It has only ſix Legs, ſhap'd like thoſe of a Fly, which is an Argument that it is a winged In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and though I could not perceive any ſign of them in the middle part of its Body, which ſeem'd to conſiſt of three Joints or Pieces; yet 'tis known that there are of them that have long Wings, and fly up and down in the Air. The whole Body was cas'd over with a very ſtrong Armour, and the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0377400900:143"/>was covered likewiſe with Multitudes of ſmall white ſhining Briſtles; the Legs, Horns, Head, and middle Parts of its Body were beſtuck with Hairs alſo, but ſmaller and darker. In <hi>America,</hi> as <hi>Merian</hi> writes, there are very large <hi>Ants</hi> or <hi>Piſmires,</hi> which will in one Night ſtrip whole Trees of their Leaves. They have two crooked Teeth, cutting one upon another, like a Pair of Pincers; by means of theſe, they cut the Leaves of the Trees ſo that they fall to the Ground, and the Tree looks bare and naked; juſt as it looks in the Winter in <hi>Europe:</hi> Thouſands of <hi>Ants</hi> waiſing for this Booty, catch up the Leaf as it falls on the Earth, to carry to their Homes; not ſo much for their own Food as their young ones, as yet but little Worms. This whole Proceeding ſeems, as if it were, done by a mutual Agreement amongſt themſelves; that one Party ſhould go up in the Tree to cut the Leaves, whilſt the other bears an equal ſhare of the Labour in carrying them to their Cells. Theſe <hi>Ants,</hi> when they are arriv'd to their full Growth, ſhed their Coats, or Skins, in like manner as do ſome other of the Inſect Kind; and become winged: In this ſtate they lay their Eggs juſt as the Gnats do; which are afterwards hatch'd into little Worms, or Mites; and for the Preſervation of this their Offspring it is, that the provident <hi>Ants</hi> are ſo eager and vigilant to feed and nouriſh them: So great is their Concern in this particular, as appears by their indefatigable Toil, that they may very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be eſteem'd as great Patterns of Tenderneſs and Care of their Young, as they are for Induſtry and good Economy. Theſe induſtrious little Creatures make Caverns in the Earth of a great Depth, ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially contriv'd, that one would affirm it to be a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0377400900:144"/>piece of Man's Ingenuity. Theſe <hi>Ants,</hi> they ſay, have a perpetual Enmity with the Spiders, and all other Infects of that Country, in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where they are found. When they fally out of their Caverns, which they do once a Year, an innumerable Multitude of them comes forth, which enter Peoples Houſes, range from one Room to another; and kill divers ſmall Creatures they meet with, by ſucking them to Death; that large Spider, <hi>Page</hi> 62. was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by this means in a Moment almoſt; it was beſet with ſuch Heaps of 'em, that it cou'd not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage, and free itſelf from Danger; 'tis ſaid, that even Men themſelves muſt fly for it, they make their way ſo in Troops from one Room to another; and having ranſack'd, and as it were ſwept the whole Houſe, they make to the next; till at laſt, they go back again to their Holes.</p>

The Head, Eyes, Wings, and Feet, are full of Ornaments and Contrivances; and afford no leſs pleaſing an Object to the Mind to ſpeculate upon, than to the Eye to behold; there is a moſt admirable and curious Mechaniſm in the Foot of this little Animal; whereby the Flies are inabled to walk againſt the ſides of Glaſs, perpendicularly upwards, and to contain themſelves in that Poſture as long as they pleaſe; nay, to walk and ſuſpend themſelves againſt the under Surface of many Bodies, as the Cieling of a Room, or the like; and this with as great a ſeeming Facility and Firmneſs, as if they had a natural Tendency upwards, as we are ſure they

It is a Creature active and nimble, ſo as there are very few Creatures like it, whether bigger or ſmaller, inſomuch that it will ſcape and avoid a ſmall Body, tho' coming on it exceeding ſwiftly; and if it ſees any thing approaching it which it fears, it preſently ſquats down, as it were, that it may be the more ready for its riſe. Nor is it leſs hardy in the Winter, than active in the Summer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during all the Froſts, and ſurviving till the next Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, notwithſtanding the bitter cold of our Climate. One of theſe put in Spirit of Wine, was very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeemingly kill'd, and both its Eyes and Mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look very red; but upon the taking it out, and ſuffering it to lie three or four Hours, and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the Sun beams caſt through a Burning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, it again reviv'd, ſeeming, as it were, to have been all the intermediate time dead Drunk, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certain Hours to grow freſh again and ſober. The Eyes of a Fly are placed in two Cluſters; and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0377400900:147"/>the number of the Pearls or Hemiſpheres in the Cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a Drone Fly, according to Dr. <hi>Hooke</hi>'s Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, with the help of a Glaſs, was near fourteen thouſand: which he judged by numbering certain rows of them ſeveral ways, and caſting up the whole Contents, accounting each Cluſter to contain about ſeven thouſand; three thouſand of which were of a larger ſize, and four thouſand to be the number of the ſmaller Pearls. Tho' this may ſeem ſtrange, other Inſects, <hi>he ſays,</hi> he has obſerv'd to have yet a greater number of Eyes, as the Dragon-Fly, or Adderbolt. In living Flies, he has obſerv'd, that when any ſmall Mote or Duſt, which flies up and down the Air, chances to light upon any part of theſe knobs of the Eyes, as it is ſure to ſtick firmly to it and not fall, the Fly preſently makes uſe of his two fore Feet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Eye-lids, with which, as with two Brooms or Bruſhes, they being all beſtuck with Briſtles, he often ſweeps or bruſhes off whatever hinders the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any of its Hemiſpheres; and then, to free his Feet from that Dirt, he rubs them one againſt the other, cleanſing them in the ſame manner as I have obſerv'd thoſe that card Wool to cleanſe their Cards, by placing their Cards ſo as the Teeth of both look the ſame way, and then rubbing them one againſt another. In the very ſame manner do they bruſh and cleanſe their Bodies and Wings: Other Creatures have other Contrivances for the cleanſing and clearing their Eyes.</p>

As among greater Animals there are many that are ſcaled, both for Ornament and Defence, ſo are there not wanting ſuch alſo among the leſſer Bodies of Inſects, whereof this little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives us an Inſtance. It is a ſmall white ſilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhining Worm or Moth, found much converſant among Books and Papers; and is ſuppos'd to be that which corrodes and eats Holes through the Leaves and Covers: It appears to the naked Eya, a ſmall glittering Pearl-colour'd Moth, which upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of Books and Papers in the Summer, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerv'd to ſcud, and pack away to ſome lurking Cranney, where it may the better protect itſelf from any appearing Dangers. Its Head appears big and blunt, and its Body tapers from it towards the Tail, ſmaller and ſmaller, being ſhap'd almoſt like a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot. The Body is divided into fourteen ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, being the appearance of ſo many ſeveral Shells, or Shields that cover the whole Body; every of theſe Shells are again covered or tiled over with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thin tranſparent Scales, which, from the multiplicity of their reflecting Surfaces, make the whole Animal appear of a perfect Pearl-colour. This Inſect was furniſh'd on either ſide of its Head with a Cluſter of Eyes; and each of theſe Cluſters were beſet with a row of ſmall Briſtles, much like the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> or Hairs on the Eye-lids; and, perhaps, they ſerv'd for the ſame purpoſe. It had two long Horns; curiouſly ring'd or knobb'd, having at each knob ſmall Hairs, or Briſtles, here and there diſpers'd among them: beſides theſe, it had two ſhorter
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0377400900:150"/>Horns, or Feelers, which were knotted and fring'd, juſt as the former. It had three Tails, in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſembling the two longer Horns that grow out of the Head. The Legs of it were ſcal'd and hair'd juſt like the reſt, but are not expreſs'd in this Figure, the Creature being intangled all in Glue, and ſo the Legs of this appear'd not through the Glaſs, which looked perpendicularly upon the Back. The Body is beſet with ſharp-pointed Briſtles, like Spears. Dr. <hi>Hooke</hi> ſays, This Animal probably ſeeds upon the Paper and Covers of Books, and perforates in them ſeveral ſmall round Holes. Mr. <hi>Albin</hi> calls it the <hi>Cloth Worm,</hi> or Moth, and ſays it is the very Creature that eats the woollen Cloth; and that it is produced from a ſmall grey ſpeckled Moth that flies a-nights, and creeps in among woollen Cloths, and there lays her Eggs, which are hatch'd in their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the natural Heat of the Woollen; upon which theſe little Creatures feed, till they change into a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſect like their Animal Parent. To prevent the Havock that this little Creature (which is one of the Teeth of Time) is wont to make among woollen Cloths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They ſhould ſometimes be air'd and bruſh'd, before the warm Seaſon comes on for the Eggs to hatch, which will abſolutely deſtroy the Eggs, and preſerve the Garments.</p>

Reading one Day in <hi>September,</hi> I chanced to obſerve a very ſmall Creature creep over the Book I was reading, very ſlowly; having a Microſcope by me, I obſerv'd it to be a Creature of a very unuſual Form, and that not leſs notable, as the Figure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents. Its natural bigneſs was about the ſize of a large Mite, or ſomewhat longer; it had ten Legs, eight of which were topt with very ſharp Claws, and were thoſe upon which he walk'd, ſeeming ſhap'd much like thoſe of a Crab, which in many other things alſo this little Creature reſembled; for the two other Claws, which were the foremoſt of all the ten, were exactly form'd in the manner of Crabs or Lobſters Claws; which this little Animal did open and ſhut at pleaſure: It ſeem'd to make uſe of thoſe two Claws both for Feelers and Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for in its motion it carried theſe aloft extended before, moving them to and fro, juſt as a man blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded would do his Hands, when he is fearful of running againſt a Wall; and if I put an Hair to it, it would readily take hold of it with theſe Claws, and ſeem to hold it faſt. The whole Body was caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Armour-ſhells, as is uſual in all thoſe Kinds of <hi>cruſtaceous</hi> Creatures, eſpecially about their Bellies, and ſeem'd of three kinds; the Head ſeem'd cover'd with a kind of ſcaly Shell, the Thorax with two ſmooth Shells, or Rings; and the Belly with eight knobb'd ones. I could not certainly find, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it had under theſe laſt Shells any Wings, but I ſuſpect the contrary; for I have not found any wing'd Infect with eight Legs, two of thoſe Legs being
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0377400900:153"/>always converted into Wings; and, for the moſt part, thoſe that have but ſix, have Wings. This Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though I could never meet with more than one of them, and ſo could not make ſo many Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it as otherwiſe I would, I did notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon of the great Curioſity that appear'd to me in its ſhape, delineate it, to ſhew that, in all like-lihood, Nature had crowded together into this very minute Infect, as many, and as excellent Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as into the Body of a very large Crab, which exceeds it in Bulk, perhaps, ſome Millions of times: It being a general Rule in Nature's Proceedings, that where ſhe begins to diſplay any Excellency, if the Subject be further ſearch'd into, it will manifeſt, that there is not leſs Curioſity in thoſe Parts which our ſingle Eye cannot reach, than in thoſe which are more obvious.

But as this Difficulty is now overcome, by the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0377400900:160"/>of theſe Trees there are now growing both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> ſo we may expect to be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them from many different Parts, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the <hi>Caribbee</hi> Iſlands, where the Trees are found to ſucceed as well as in their native Soil; but whether the <hi>Coffee</hi> produced in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> will prove as good as that brought from <hi>Mocha,</hi> Time will diſcover. The Berries of this Plant are commonly ripe with us in <hi>April. Coffee</hi> is of an excellent dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality; it comforts the Brain, eaſes Pains of the Head, ſuppreſſes Vapours, dries up Crudities in the Stomach; prevents Sleepineſs after eating, and gives Life and Gaiety to the Spritis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>TEA is the Leaf of a ſmall Shrub, which grows plentifully in ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> It is brought over dry'd from <hi>China, Japan,</hi> and <hi>Siam.</hi> Theſe Leaves they gather in the Spring, at which time they are little and tender, and of the ſhape of the Figure in the Plate. It bears a Flower compoſed of five white Leaves, form'd like a Roſe, and ſome <hi>Stamina;</hi> which, when gone, is ſucceeded by a thick Cod, like a Hazel-nut, of a Cheſnut-colour, in which is found two or three Nuts or Berries, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in each a little luſcious Almond, of an ill Taſte. The Root is fibrous, and ſpreads upon the Surface of the Earth. This Shrub flouriſhes equally in rich or poor Ground. The <hi>Tea</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. bring over in curl'd or twiſted Leaves, is thus prepar'd by the Natives of the Country; who, after they have gather'd it, dry it gently before the Fire, and the Leaves in drying curl up, juſt as we have them brought over. In buying <hi>Tea,</hi> chooſe that which is greeneſt, the beſt ſcented, and which is as little broke into Duſt or ſmall Powder as poſſible. They ſay, the chief reaſon that <hi>Tea</hi> is become ſuch a Commodity throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> is becauſe the <hi>Duth,</hi> &amp;c. change Sage for it, which the <hi>Japoneſe</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> are great Lovers of: Which is not without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, ſince we have not a Plant endow'd with more Virtues than Sage, eſpecially that ſort, which

So that we need not wonder if the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> &amp;c. exchange <hi>Tea</hi> for it. Tho! this Liquor is more us'd for Pleaſure than for any Medicinal Purpoſe, yet are there a great many good Qualities attributed to it.</p>
                     <p>The COCAO Tree, that bears the <hi>Chocolate</hi> Nut, much reſembles our <hi>Heart-Cherry</hi> Tree; but at its full Growth ſpreads to a greater breadth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and is ſomething loftier: 'Tis well ſupplied with Leaves, that reſemble thoſe of the Orange Tree; but are longer, and more ſharp-pointed: It is always flouriſhing, eſpecially towards the two Solſtices; for as the Leaves only fall off ſucceſſively, and as others grow again; this Tree never appears naked. The Bloſſoms are regular, and like a Roſe, but very ſmall and without Smell: Every Bloſſom is joined to the Tree by a ſlender Stalk, and leaves in falling off long ſtringly Filaments, which are green, from which a yellow pointed Fruit is form'd, of the ſize of our Melons; which adhere to the thick Boughs or Branches, not admitting of any Intermedium, or Stem, as Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do. Each Fruit contains from fifteen to twenty-five little Nuts, or Almonds; they are each of them cover'd with a yellowiſh thin Skin; which being ſeparated, a tender Subſtance appears, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral unequal Particles, that are olly, of good Nouriſhment, and leave a certain ſharpneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Palate. Theſe Trees grow in all the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt Indies, Jamaica,</hi> &amp;c. They commonly bear Fruit within ſeven Years ſpace, or leſs, after their firſt Plantation; tho' in the Interim they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twice or thrice removed, and great Care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſecure them with Shades, that they may not be injured by the over-powerful Heat of the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun, of which they are not in danger, when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0377400900:164"/>they once become great; for being planted in Ranks and regular Walks, ſhady Plantane Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are rang'd with them; and one ſhelters the other, both from the parching Sun and boiſterous Wind. As it is a Tree of ſingular Beauty, having large, broad, ablong green Leaves, which fall back, and hang like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Shields, to preſerve and defend the tender Fruit; ſo is it likewiſe a Tree of great Profit to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ariſing from its moſt deſirable Fruit, which grows after an admirable manner in Cods; ſtudded, as it were in the very Body of the Tree, from the Earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as well as the Arms and large Boughs: But the Fruit never grows at the Ends of the ſmall Branches. And herein we may eaſily apprehend, that if Nature had plac'd ſuch bulky Fruit at the ends of the Branches, their great weight muſt neceſſarily break them; and the Fruit would fall before it come to Maturity. The Nuts, they ſay, among the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> go for current Money, even in thoſe Countries where Gold and Silver are naturally produc'd; being to them Food and Raiment, Riches and Delight, all at once. It ſeems almoſt unneceſſary to tell the Reader, that the Uſe of theſe Nuts is to make that well-known Liquor call'd <hi>Chocolate,</hi> every one being acquainted with it.</p>
                     <p>The SUGAR-CANE grows plentifully in many Parts of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Caribbee</hi> Iſlands, as <hi>Barbadoes, Jamaica, Nevis,</hi> &amp;c. This Plant bears on each Joint a <hi>Cane</hi> of five or ſix Foot high, adorn'd with long ſtraight green Leaves, much like to ſome <hi>Flags,</hi> or <hi>Flower-de-luces,</hi> but not ſo broad, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on its top a ſilver-colour'd Flower, like a plume of Feathers. Theſe <hi>Canes</hi> are not hollow; but the Stalk is ſtuffed with a porous Subſtance, moiſt and ſweet in taſte. When they come to Maturity, which the Planters know by ſeveral Signs, as well as we know when our Harveſt is ready; they cut the <hi>Canes</hi> down at or above the firſt Joint from the Ground; laying them in Heaps, as we uſually lay our Corn in Harveſt time: then they clear them from their Leaves, and bind the Stalks in Bundles.

All the time it is boiling, they take off the Scum, which riſes in great quantities, until it be fit to empty into Coolers, that is, till it arrives to its juſt Body: From the Coolers, it is again ſhifted into earthen Pots, with Holes in their Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and other Pots they call Drips, under them, for receiving the <hi>Moloſſes;</hi> which in about a Month's time will be ſeparated from the Sugar; this is then knock'd out of the Pots, and put into Casks or Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, for Tranſportation. The <hi>Sugar-Cane</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is very tender, and cannot be preſerv'd without a Stove; it is kept as a great Curioſity in the Gardens of ſuch as love a Variety of Plants, as being the Plant from whence the <hi>Sugar</hi> is produced.</p>
                     <p>NUTMEGS are of two ſorts; diſtinguiſhed by Male and Female; the latter is the beſt, and moſt commonly uſed; The Male, which is a long and large Nut, is ſeldom uſed: The Female, which is the rounder and leſſer Nut, is that generally ſold in the Grocers Shops; and the Trees which bear the Female, or common <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> grow not but in cultivated or improv'd Lands; but the Males, or long Nutmegs, grow in Woods and Foreſts, which makes the <hi>Dutch</hi> call them <hi>Wild Nutmegs.</hi> The Tree that produces the common, or beſt ſort of <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> is as large as a Pear-Tree, with Leaves ſhap'd like thoſe of the Peach, but much ſmaller: The Bloſſom is in the ſhape of a Roſe, of a pleaſant Smell; after the Flower is fallen off, a Fruit appears, as large as a green Wall-nut; the <hi>Nutmeg</hi> is the Kernel of this Fruit, which is cover'd with two Barks; the firſt is very thick, and pull'd off when the Fruit is ripe; the ſecond is much thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and finer, of a reddiſh Colour inclining to yellow: It is ſeparated from the <hi>Nutmeg</hi> in order to dry, and is what we call <hi>Mace.</hi> When the <hi>Nutmegs</hi> are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0377400900:168"/>from their Barks, they dry and preſerve them. The Nutmeg-Trees grow plentifully in the great Iſland of <hi>Banda,</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in ſeveral other Iſlands in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Dutch;</hi> it being a Commodity which none but themſelves are Maſters of. Theſe Iſles, they ſay, are ſo ſtock'd with Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg-Trees, that it is almoſt incredible; and the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſo good, that the Trees are always loaden with this rich Fruit; and that they have three Crops a Year, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>April, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>December.</hi> This Tree, according to Mr. <hi>Tavernier,</hi> is not planted, but grows by means of certain Birds, which ſwallow the <hi>Nutmegs</hi> whole, and throw them up again, without having digeſted them; and the <hi>Nutmeg</hi> being then cover'd with a viſcous and gluey Matter, and being caſt upon the Ground, they take Root, and produce a Tree, which grows juſt as if it had been planted after the manner of others.</p>
                     <p>CINNAMON is a thin Bark, taken from a Tree about the height of our Willow, which bears a Leaf ſhaped like the <hi>Indian</hi> Leaf called <hi>Malabathrum.</hi> The Flowers grow in little Cups of a light blue Colour, and odoriferous, ſucceeded by a Fruit of the ſhape and ſize of a ſmall Olive, green at firſt, but growing black as it ripens. The Tree, which produces <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon,</hi> grows without Culture in the Iſland of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the Trade thereof is entirely in the Hands of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are Maſters of the Coaſts of that Iſland. There are nine or ten different ſorts of <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon;</hi> the beſt ſort, which grows in great plenty in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and is peculiar to that Iſland, is call'd by the Natives <hi>Raſſe coronde,</hi> that is, <hi>ſharp, ſweet Cinnamon:</hi> It is exported yearly by the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> who have ordered under ſeveral Penalties that no other ſort be mixed with it. All the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> Trees, the beſt as well as the reſt, muſt grow a certain number of Years, before the Bark is fit to be taken off. Thoſe which grow in Vallies where the Soil is a ſine whitiſh Sand, will be ripe in five Years: others which ſtand in a wet ſlimy Soil, muſt grow ſeven or eight Years; thoſe are later

                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0377400900:170"/>which grow in the ſhade of other larger Trees; and their Bark hath not that Sweetneſs and agreeable Taſte, obſervable in the Bark of thoſe which grow in a white ſandy Ground, where with little wet they ſtand fully expoſed to the Sun; but it is rather of a bitteriſh Taſte, ſomething aſtringent, and ſmells like Camphire. If the Bark be freſh taken off, that Juice which remains in the Tree hath a bitteriſh Taſte, not unlike that of Cloves: On the contrary, if you taſte the inner Membrane of the Bark when freſh ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, you'll find it moſt exquiſitely ſweet, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly agreeable to the Taſle; whereas the outer part of the Bark differs but very little in Taſte from that of the common Trees; which ſhews plainly that all the Sweetneſs of it is owing only to the inner Membrane. But when the Bark is laid in the Sun in order to its being dried and wound up, this oily and agreeable Sweetneſs of the inner Membrane diffuſes itſelf throughout the whole outward part of it, (which however hath been firſt ſtripped while yet upon the Tree of its outermoſt greeniſh Coat) and imbues it ſo ſtrongly, that for the fragrancy of its Smell and the ſweetneſs of its Taſte it is coveted all the World over. The Bark may remain upon ſome Trees, without loſing its Sweetneſs and Virtue, fourteen, fifteen, or ſixteen Years, according to the quality of the Soil they ſtand in; but after that time it loſes by degrees its agreeable Sweetneſs, and taſtes ſtronger of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire: Beſides, it is then grown ſo thick, that if it be laid in the Sun it will no longer ſhrink and wind itſelf up, but remain flat. In order to account for the vaſt quantity of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> that has been, and is ſtill yearly exported from <hi>Ceylon;</hi> ſeveral Authors have affirmed, that when the Bark hath been ſtripped off the <hi>Cinnamon</hi> Trees, it grows again in four or five Years, and becomes fit to be ſtripped a ſecond time: but this is utterly falſe; for tho' the Trees, after the Bark hath been once taken off, are cut down to the very Ground, yet the Root quickly puſhes forth new Shoots, which grow up and ripen in five, ſix, ſeven, or eight Years, ſome ſooner, ſome later, and then yield their Bark. Thus far the old Roots are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0377400900:171"/>to the Growth and Plenty of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> Trees, but their Fruit likewiſe contributes very much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſame end: And it is particularly owing to a certain kind of wild Doves, which from their eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fruit of this Tree they call <hi>Cinnamon-Eaters,</hi> that they grow ſo plentifully in this Iſland; for the Doves, when they fetch Food for their young ones, diſperſe vaſt quantities of the Fruit all over the Fields, which occaſions the Riſe of many thouſand young Trees. The Oil drawn from <hi>Cinnamon</hi> by Fire, is reckon'd one of the ſtrongeſt Cordial Medicines: The Camphire which comes out of the Root, is likewiſe of very great uſe in ſeveral Diſtempers; as are alſo the Oil of Camphire, a very coſtly thing; the Leaves of the Tree, and the Oil diſtilled out of them; and laſtly the Fruits, with their Oil. In ſhort, there is no part of the <hi>Cinnamon</hi> Tree, but what is of ſome ſingular Uſe in Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>CLOVES are the Foot-ſtalks of the Flowers of the <hi>Clove</hi> Tree, pluck'd before they are full blown: When the Fruit begins to appear, their Colour is of a whitiſh green; afterwards they grow red; and at laſt, when ripe, of a dark brown. Theſe Trees grew plentifully in the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands, till the <hi>Dutch,</hi> not being able to hinder the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſome other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from going thither, and bringing away <hi>Cloves</hi> from thence, thought it adviſable, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely Maſters of that Commodity, to pluck up all the Trees, and tranſport them to an Iſland of their own, called <hi>Ternate;</hi> by which means other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are forced to purchaſe that valuable Merchandiſe from them. There is no other Art uſed with the <hi>Cloves</hi> after they are pluck'd from the Tree, but to let them dry in the open Fields expos'd to the heat of the Sun, and after that to keep them carefully from the Air. There is alſo deſcrib'd by ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, the <hi>Royal Clove;</hi> ſo called from bearing on its top a ſort of Crown; for which reaſon the King of the Country keeps it in his own Poſſeſſion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is 2 common fabulous Opinion; that the other Trees bow towards this as their King.</p>

The Vine that bears this Fruit is low, furniſh'd with thick Leaves, very much indented, and like all other Vines ſending forth Claſpers at the Joints; by which it faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens itſelf to whatever Plant ſtands near it; and the Fruit is produced in Bunches. Theſe Vines grow plentifully in a vaſt ſpacious Plain that is ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Fortreſs of <hi>Zant</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> This Plain is ſurrounded with Mountains and Hills, and is divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Vineyards, in which are abundance of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Olives, and Houſes of Pleaſure, which make together with the Fortreſs and the Mount <hi>Diſcoppo,</hi> a Proſpect perfectly beautiful. When theſe little Grapes are ripe, which generally happens in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Zant</hi> gather and ſtone them, then ſpread them upon the Ground to dry, and when dry'd carry them into the Town, where they are thrown through a Hole into the great Magazine, call'd the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> and are there preſs'd ſo cloſe together in a Maſs, that they are oblig'd to uſe Iron Inſtruments to pull them out; which done, they put 'em into Casks or Bales of different ſizes; and to make them ſo tight as they are brought to us, they employ Men to tread them with their Feet, for which purpoſe they rub 'em well with Oil beforehand. <hi>Currants</hi> are brought from ſeveral Places in the <hi>Levant;</hi> but the ſort we uſe is chiefly brought from the Iſlands near the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea.</hi> They ſay, the People of <hi>Zant,</hi> where theſe <hi>Currants</hi> grow, believe that the <hi>Europeans</hi> uſe them to dye Cloths, not knowing that they are for eating. As <hi>Currants</hi> are the Fruit of the Vine, ſo likewiſe the ſeveral kinds of <hi>Raiſins</hi> are only ſo many ſorts of Grapes, differing according to the Countries where they are produced. When the Grapes are ripe, they gather the Bunches, and put them to dry in the Sun, turning them from one ſide to the other, by which means they dry equally; and when dry they put 'em
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0377400900:179"/>up into little Cheſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Tranſportation: Tho', as ſome ſay, before they expoſe the Bunches to dry in the Sun, they firſt dip them into a certain Liquor prepared for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The POMEGRANATE Tree is a Shrub, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are two kinds; one cultivated in Gardens, and the other wild. The Branches of the firſt are ſmall, angular, armed with Thorns; the Bark is red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh; the Leaves ſmall, and reſemble thoſe of the Myrtle, but leſs pointed, hanging by reddiſh Stalks, of a ſtrong Smell, when they are cruſh'd or bruiſed. The Flower is large, of a beautiful red, inclining to purple, compos'd of ſeveral Leaves, like a Roſe in the hollow of a Cup, repreſenting a little Basket of Flowers; the Cup is oblong, hard, purpliſh, large at the top, having in ſome meaſure the figure of a Bell. At the bottom comes a Fruit, after the Flower is gone, which grows into a large round Apple, having a thick, ſmooth, brittle Rind, adorn'd with a Crown, form'd by the top of the Cup, of a purple Hue, dark without, and yellow within: this Apple is call'd <hi>the Pomegranate.</hi> The inſide is divided into ſeveral Cells or Partitions full of Seed, heap'd one upon another, being fleſhy, of a fine red Colour, abounding with a very pleaſant Juice; and each contains in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of them, an oblong Grain, of a yellow Colour, and ſometimes very irregularly form'd. The <hi>Wild Pomegranate</hi> is a Shrub like the former, but more rough and thorny: They gather the Flowers when in their prime; theſe are dry'd to keep, which are brought to us from the <hi>Levant.</hi> The <hi>Wild Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate</hi> grows only in the hot Countries. The Juice of the <hi>Pomegranate</hi> is much valued in Phyſick. There are with us in <hi>England</hi> reckon'd five ſorts of <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate</hi> Trees, chiefly cultivated for Ornament, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, the <hi>common Pomegranate,</hi> ſecond the <hi>ſweet,</hi> third the <hi>wild,</hi> fourth the <hi>double flower'd,</hi> and fifth the <hi>American dwarf Pomegranate.</hi> The firſt of theſe Trees is now pretty common in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gardens, where formerly it was nurſed up in Caſes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd with great Care, as was alſo the double Kind;

The chief Care is to plant them upon a rich ſtrong Soil, and in a warm Situation. The double flowering kind of this Plant is much more eſteemed than the other in this Country, for the ſake of its large beautiful double Flowers, which are of a fine ſcarlet Colour; and if the Trees are ſupply'd with Nouriſhment, will continue to produce Flowers for near three Months ſucceſſively, which renders it one of the moſt valuable flowering Trees yet known.

                     <p>RICE is the Product of a Plant much cultivated in moſt of the Eaſtern Countries; and great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it are brought into <hi>England,</hi> and other <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Countries every Year; where it is in great eſteem for Puddings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it being too tender to be produc'd in theſe northern Countries, without the aſſiſtance of artificial Heat: But from ſome Seeds formerly ſent to <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> there have been great quantities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; and it is found to ſucceed equally as well there, as in its native Soil; which is a very great Improvement to our <hi>American</hi> Settlements: it being a Seed of ſo great Uſe and Profit, that it is call'd the Manna of the Poor; and throughout ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, it is the chief Support of the Inhabitants. This Plant bears its Stalk about three or four Feet high, much thicker and ſtronger than that of Wheat and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0377400900:183"/>other Corn: The Leaves are long like the Reed, and fleſhy; the Flowers blow on the top like Barley; but the Seed, which follows, is diſpos'd in Cluſters, each of which is enclos'd in a yellow Husk, ending in a ſpiral Thread, and of an oblong, or rather oval Figure. This Plant grows upon moiſt Soils, where the Ground can be flow'd over with Water after it is come up; ſo that whoever would cultivate it in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for Curioſity, ſhould ſow the Seeds upon a Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and when the Plants are come up, they ſhould be tranſplanted into Pots fill'd with rich light Earth, and plac'd in Pans of Water, which ſhould be plung'd into a Hot-bed; and as the Water waſtes, ſo it muſt from time to time be renew'd again. In <hi>July</hi> theſe Plants may be ſet abroad in a warm Situation, ſtill preſerving the Water in the Pans, otherwiſe they will not thrive; and towards the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they will produce their Grain, which will ripen tolerably well, provided the Autumn proves favourable. Tho' the chief uſe of <hi>Rice</hi> be for Food, it is ſometimes made uſe of in Medicine: It nouriſhes well, ſtops Fluxes, is good in Armies, Camps, and Sieges; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis of light Carriage, and excellent Suſtenance, and eaſily prepared.

                     <p>There are ſeveral Species of the CORK-Tree mention'd in ſome of the <hi>Italian</hi> Catalogues of Plants; but the chief are the <hi>broad-leav'd ever-green Cork-Tree,</hi> and the <hi>narrow-leav'd Cork-Tree, with ſmooth Edges:</hi> I ſhall ſpeak only of the firſt. The broad-leav'd <hi>Cork</hi> that is always green, is a Tree of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate height, very much reſembling the Oak; but the Trunk is bigger, bearing fewer Boughs, and the Bark a great deal thicker, very light, ſpungy, and of an aſh Colour, tending towards a yellow; which Bark is taken from the Tree firſt, and afterwards freed from an inner Bark. The Leaves of the <hi>Cork</hi>-Tree are ſomething like thoſe of the Oak, but much larger and longer, likewiſe foſter, and greener on the outſide, and

This Tree grows in the hot Countries, as <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> towards the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> and in <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> &amp;c. When the Inhabitants of thoſe Parts wou'd make a Crop of this Commodity, they take off the Bark of theſe Trees from the top to the bottom, and lay one piece upon another, to a reaſonable height, in a Pit or Ditch that is full of Water; and having loaded it with Weights to keep it down, they leave it in this Condition for ſome time; and when it is well ſoak'd, and laid ſtraight, they remove it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Ditch, and ſo to a third and fourth; and after that take it out of the Water to dry: which being done, it is tranſported in Bales to different Parts of the World.

                     <p>Of the TOBACCO Plant there are five different Species. The firſt is known by the Planters in <hi>America,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Oroonoko;</hi> of which there ſeems to be two ſorts, varying in the largeneſs and tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Leaves, ſome having very broad, rough, roundiſh Leaves; and others are narrower, ſmoother, and do terminate in a Point: But neither of theſe ſorts are valued by the <hi>American</hi> Planters, becauſe the Produce of this, tho' it is much greater than the narrow-leav'd ſort, yet is not near ſo much eſteem'd by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The ſecond ſort is the narrow-leav'd,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0377400900:187"/>commonly call'd the <hi>ſweet-ſcented Tobacco,</hi> from its having a much more agreeable Scent when ſmoak'd, than the broad-leav'd ſort; the Smoak of which is very offenſive to moſt Perſons who have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it. This ſort is cultivated in great plenty in <hi>Virginia, Cuba, Braſil,</hi> and ſeveral other Parts of <hi>America;</hi> from whence it is brought to moſt Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but eſpecially to <hi>England,</hi> it being prohibited to be cultivated in this Country, leſt His Majeſty's Revenues ſhould be thereby leſſen'd; excepting a finall quantity that is permitted to be cultivated for Medicinal Uſe. The third ſort is, the greater narrow-leav'd <hi>Perennial Tobacco,</hi> brought from the <hi>French</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> into the Royal Garden at <hi>Paris,</hi> where it is cultivated in ſmall quantities for making Snuff. The fourth and fifth two ſmaller ſorts of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> are preſerv'd in Botanick Gardens for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, but are ſeldom propagated for Uſe. The <hi>Tobacco</hi> Plants are raiſed from Seed; which they ſow firſt in a rich Ground, and when the Plants are come up, cover them every Morning with Branches of Trees, to defend them from the ſcorching heat of the Sun; and having clear'd a piece of Ground to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Plants, they tranſplant them in a rainy or moiſt Seaſon, planting them down again in rows, at about two or three Feet diſtance from each other, that they may have room to ſpread, without the Leaves touching one another, ſo as to make them rot and corrupt. After the <hi>Tobacco</hi> is thus planted, they will require no farther Care, but only from time to time to keep them clear from Weeds, until the Plants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhew their Flower-Stems; at which time they cut off the tops of them, that their leaves may be the better nouriſh'd, become larger, and of a thicker Subſtance; and likewiſe pulling off conſtantly the Leaves underneath, that hang on the Ground, ſo that they leave about ten or twelve Leaves upon a Stalk, by which means they increaſe prodigiouſly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much thicker. When the <hi>Tobacco</hi> is ripe, they cut and ſpread it upon the Ground; after which they ſtring it upon certain Cords, in little Knots, ſo that the Plants may not touch one another; then they

                     <p>COTTON is the Product of a Plant which bears a Stalk about two Foot high, cover'd with a reddiſh hairy Bark, divided into ſeveral ſhort Branches: The Leaves are a little leſs than the Sycamore Leaves, ſhap'd almoſt like thoſe of the Vine, hanging to long Stalks, adorn'd with a kind of Nap, or Hair: The Flowers are numerous, fine and large, having the ſhape or form of a Bell, ſlit or cut into five or ſix Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the bottom, of a yellow Colour, mix'd with red or purple: When the Flower is fallen, 'tis ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Fruit the bigneſs of a Filbert; which being ripe opens into three or four Partitions, from whence appears a: Flake of <hi>Cotton,</hi> white as Snow, which ſwells up or tumeſies by Heat, to the ſize of a little Apple. It contains in it many groſs Seeds, like ſmall Peas, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and cottony; each having in it a little oily Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, ſweet to the Taſte. There is another ſort of <hi>Cotton</hi> Tree that differs from the former in bigneſs, for this grows to the height of four or five Feet: The Leaves indented deep into three Parts, without Nap or Down: The Flowers and Fruit are like thoſe of the other Kind. Both theſe ſorts of <hi>Cotton</hi> grow in <hi>Egypt, Syria, Cyprus, Candia,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> In <hi>Jamaica, Barbadoes,</hi> and other Places in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the <hi>Cotton</hi> Tree uſually grows to a reaſonable height, ſpreading ſorth its Branches on all ſides; with ſmall, green, pointed Leaves; and beareth a Flower in form almoſt like the Sweet-Briar Roſe, but of a yellowiſh Colour: After the Bloſſoms are fallen, there followeth a kind of greeniſh round Button, or Knob almoſt as big as a Tennis Ball, having a thin cruſty Shell; which when full rice is of a dark brown or blackiſh Colour: In theſe round Buttons is incloſed the <hi>Cotton,</hi> which open when ripe in ſeveral Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like the former, out of which the <hi>Cotton</hi> falleth, if not timely gather'd: it contains likewiſe a great number of ſmall blackiſh Seeds, that grow incloſed in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0377400900:190"/>the ſame Shell, which before the <hi>Cotton</hi> is made uſe of are pick'd out. There grow likewiſe in ſome of the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, <hi>Cotton</hi> Buſhes, or Shrubs, which approach very near in likeneſs to thoſe of <hi>Egypt, Arabia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The MANDRAKE Plant is diſtinguiſh'd by two Species; <hi>viz.</hi> the Common with a round Fruit, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Male Mandrake,</hi> and that with the purpliſh blue Flower, called the <hi>Female Mandrake.</hi> The Leaves of the former riſe directly from the Root, above a Foot long, broader than a Man's Hand in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and narrow at both Ends, ſmooth, of a deep green Colour, and a diſagreeable Smell. The Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of both theſe Plants are of the ſhape of a Bell, divided at the tops into ſeveral Parts, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards becomes a globular ſoft Fruit, in which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain'd many kidney-ſhap'd Seeds. The Root, as ſome ſay, repreſents, when it is whole, the lower Parts of a Man, from whence it is called <hi>Anthropomorpha,</hi> which ſignifies the Figure of a Man. But as to this feigned reſemblance of an human Form, which the Root of this Plant is ſaid to carry, 'tis all Impoſture, owing to the Cunning of Quacks and deſigning Knaves, who deceive the Ignorant with fictitious Images ſhap'd from the freſh Roots of <hi>Briony</hi> and other Plants: And what is reported as to the manner of rooting up this Plant, by tying a Dog thereto, to prevent the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death of the Perſon who ſhould dare to attempt it, and the Groans it emits upon the Force offer'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is all a fulſome Fable: for ſeveral large Roots of this Plant have been taken up; ſome of which have been tranſplanted into other Places, without obſerving any particular difference in this from any other deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooting Plant.

The Root is about a Foot long, divided into two Branches, brown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, white within, and furniſh'd with ſome Fibres, but nothing like the Male Plant. Both ſorts grow in hot Countries, in the Plains or mountainous Places; but the laſt much rarer. Theſe Plants are propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gardens from Seeds, which ſhou'd be ſown upon a Bed of light Earth ſoon after they are ripe; where they ſhould remain till the latter end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> (obſerving always to keep them clear from Weeds) at which time they ſhould be taken up very carefully, and tranſplanted into the Places where they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, which ſhould be a light deep Soil, for their Roots do always run downwards very deep; and if the Plants are not diſturb'd, they will grow to a large ſize in a few Years, and will produce great quantities of Flowers and Fruit, and they will abide a great many Years. There are <hi>Mandrakes</hi> mention'd in the 30th Chap. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which <hi>Reuben</hi> is ſaid to have found in the Field, in the time of Wheat Harveſt; and with which his Mother <hi>Leah</hi> purchas'd from her Siſter <hi>Rachel</hi> no leſs a Favour than the Enjoyment of her Husband. What thoſe <hi>Mandrakes</hi> ſhould be that were ſo deſirable to <hi>Rachel;</hi> whether ſhe coveted them for their delectable Taſte, their fragrant Smell, or their beautiful Colour, does not appear: And as our learned Commentators differ in their Opinions about it, I ſhall not venture to give my own; but only obſerve, that in the <hi>Canticles</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes give a ſmell, and at our gates are all manner of pleaſant fruits:</hi> Which ſeems to intimate, as if the <hi>Mandrakes</hi> were a Fruit of a pleaſant Taſte, a fragrant Smell, and delightful to the Eye: for when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, the <hi>Mandrakes give a ſmell;</hi> ſure he muſt mean a grateful Smell, or methinks he would hardly have introduc'd them to adorn a Paſtoral Song: and as he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0377400900:193"/>immediately adds, <hi>at our gates are all manner of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruits;</hi> it ſeems to imply, that the <hi>Mandrake</hi> was likewiſe a pleaſant Fruit, which perhaps, was ſo both to the Eye and Palate: But be that as it will, this we may venture to affirm, that the <hi>Mandrake</hi> Plants known to us now, whether wild or cultivated; have no ſuch deſirable qualities, as to render them ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to the good Women of our days, to give in exchange their Husbands for them: For theſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is mention'd in Scripture, have a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable Smell.</p>
                     <p>BALM <hi>of Gilead</hi> is a liquid white Balſam, that flows of itſelf (tho' ſometimes they make Inciſions, when the Liquor flows not freely) during Summer, from the Trunk of a Plant, called <hi>Balſamum Syria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum folio Rutae;</hi> that bears Leaves like Rue; and white Flowers ſhap'd like Stars; in the middle of which riſe little Berries, that are ſharp at the end, in which is a ſmall Kernel: It ſticks to the Branches by means of a very ſmall Stalk; is green at firſt, and grows brown as it ripens. When the <hi>Balſam</hi> firſt runs, it is of the conſiſtence of Oil of ſweet Almonds, but by Age becomes like Turpentine, loſes much of its Smell, and grows ſometimes blackiſh. When freſh, it is of a very agreeable aromatick Smell, and of a Taſte like Citron Peel. <hi>Jerico</hi> was once the only Place in the World where this true <hi>Balſam</hi> was to be found; but ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> were Maſters of the Holy Land, they have tranſplanted theſe Shrubs into their Gardens at <hi>Grand Cairc,</hi> &amp;c. where they are guarded by <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> or Soldiers, during the time the <hi>Balſam</hi> flows; at which time it is very difficult for a Chriſtian to get a Sight of theſe Plants, which are deſended with very high Walls, as well as Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, againſt their entering.

                        <hi>Balſam of Peru;</hi> which they prepare with Spirit of Wine rectified, or with ſome Oils diſtilled. Mr. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> ſays, a Friend of his made him a Preſent of one Ounce, which he brought from <hi>Grand Cairo;</hi> it was of a ſolid Conſiſtence, like that of <hi>Turpentine of Chio,</hi> of a golden yellow Colour, and a Citron Smell.</p>
                     <p>The CEDAR <hi>of Libanus</hi> is a very large, thick, ſtraight Tree: Its Leaves ſmall and ſlender; being much narrower than thoſe of the Pine-Tree, diſpoſed in Cluſters along the Branches; and the Fruit like our Pine-Apples; but grows upon the upper part of the Branches, and ſtands erect, having a ſtrong woody central Style, by which it is firmly annex'd to the Branch, ſo as with difficulty to be taken off: which central Style remains upon the Branches, after the Cone is fallen to pieces; ſo that they never drop off whole as the Pine-Apples do. It is ſaid, that from the Trunk, and the large Branches of this Tree, there flows, during the great Heats, without any Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a ſort of white Reſin, very clear, and of a grateful Odour; which they call <hi>Cedar-Gum,</hi> of which the largeſt Trees yield not leſs than ſix Ounces a day. The <hi>Cones</hi> of the <hi>Cedar</hi> are brought from the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> which, if preſerv'd intire, will continue their Seeds for ſeveral Years: The time of their ripening is commonly in the Spring, and are near one Year old before we receive them; for which they are not the worſe, but rather the better. To get the Seeds out of the Cone, they ſplit it, by driving a ſharp piece of Iron through the Centre lengthways, and ſo pull the Seeds out with their Fingers; which Seeds are faſten'd to a thin leafy Subſtance, as are thoſe of the Firr-Tree. For the ordering the <hi>Cedar</hi> Plant, ſee <hi>Miller</hi>'s Directions in his <hi>Gardener's Dictionary.</hi> What we find mention'd in Scripture of the <hi>lofty Cedars,</hi> can be no ways applicable to the Stature of this Tree; ſince, from the Experience we have of thoſe now growing in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo from the Teſtimony of ſeveral who have viſited thoſe few remaining Trees on <hi>Mount Libanus,</hi> they are not inclin'd to grow very loſty, but, on the contrary, extend their Branches
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0377400900:196"/>very far: To which the Alluſion made by the <hi>Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt</hi> agrees very well, when he is deſcribing the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing State of a People, and ſays, <hi>They ſhall ſpread their Branches like the Cedar Tree.</hi> Mr. <hi>Maundrel,</hi> in his <hi>Travels,</hi> ſays, when he viſited <hi>Mount Libanus,</hi> there were but ſixteen large Trees remaining; ſome of which were of a prodigious Bulk, but that there were many more young Trees of a ſmaller ſize; he meaſur'd one of the largeſt, and found it to be twelve Yards ſix Inches in girt, and yet ſound, and thirty ſeven Yards in the ſpread of its Boughs. At about five or ſix Yards from the Ground, it was divided into five Limbs, each of which was equal to a great Tree. The Wood of this famous Tree is accounted Proof againſt all Putrefaction of Animal Bodies: The Saw-duſt of it is thought to be one of the Secrets uſed by thoſe Mountebanks who pretend to have the embalming Myſtery. This Wood is alſo ſaid to yield an Oil which is famous for preſerving Books and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and the Wood is thought by my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> to continue a thouſand Years ſound. Of <hi>Cedar</hi> Wood was moſt of the Timber-Work of that glorious Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                     <p>The ANANAS is a kind of Pine-Apple: adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the top with a little Crown, and a Bunch of red Leaves like Fire: It has a ſcaly Rind or Shell, like the Pine-Apple; and the Fruit like the Cones of the Pine, in the Form of a Sugar-Loaf: The inſide appears like that of the Melon; the Fleſh is fibrous, but diſſolves in the Mouth, having the delicious Taſte of the Peach, the Quince, and the Muſcadine Grape all together. It is call'd the <hi>King</hi> of Fruits, becauſe, for the richneſs of its Flavour, it ſurpaſſes all the known Fruits in the World; and alſo for the Crown upon the Head of it, which is a peculiar Mark of its Royalty; and at its fall produces a young King, that ſucceeds in all his admirable Qualities. This Fruit is produced from an herbaceous Plant, which hath Leaves ſomewhat reſembling thoſe of an Aloe, and are for the moſt part ſaw'd on their Edges, but are much thinner, and not ſo juicy as the Aloe.

Where this Plant is a Native, is not eaſy to determine; but it was brought from the Factories in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and planted in the hotteſt Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> where they are in great plenty and extraordinary goodneſs: But it hath been very lately, that it was introduc'd into the <hi>European</hi> Gardens, ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Fruit. The firſt Perſon who ſucceeded in this Affair, was Monſieur <hi>Le Cour</hi> at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> who, after a great many Trials with little or no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, did at laſt hit upon a proper degree of Heat and Management, ſo as to produce Fruit equally as good (tho' not ſo large) as thoſe which are produc'd in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> as hath been often affirm'd by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have lived many Years there; and 'tis to this worthy Cultivator of Gardening, who did not ſpare any Pains or Expence to accompliſh it, that all the Lovers thereof are oblig'd for introducing this King of Fruits amongſt them; and it was from him that our Gardens in <hi>England</hi> were firſt ſupplied, tho' we have ſince had large quantities brought from <hi>America.</hi> From the Juice of this Fruit is made a Wine, almoſt equal to Malmſey Sack, and will intoxicate as ſoon as the ſtrongeſt Wine.</p>
                     <p>The ALOE is a Plant whoſe Leaves are thick and ſucculent, and for the moſt part beſet with Spines on the Edges: The Flower conſiſts of one Leaf, is tubulous, and cut into ſix Segments at the top, like the Hyacinth: The Fruit is oblong and cylindrical; which is divided into three Cells, in which are confin'd flat, and for the moſt part ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular Seeds. There are a great variety of theſe Plants in the curious Gardens of Botany in <hi>England,</hi> near forty different ſorts, which are Natives both of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies;</hi> but the moſt curious ſorts are brought from the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Good Hope.</hi> Moſt of the <hi>African</hi> ſorts of <hi>Aloes</hi> do produce Flowers with us Annually, when grown to a ſufficient ſize, which is often the ſecond, and ſeldom more than the third
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0377400900:200"/>or fourth Year, after planting from Off-ſets; but the <hi>American Aloes</hi> (which do, for the moſt part, produce their Flower-ſtems immediately from the Center of the Plant) ſeldom flower till they are of a conſiderable Age, and this but once during the Life of the Plant; for when the Flower-ſtem begins to ſhoot from the middle of the Plant (which, for the moſt part, is of a large ſize, and grows to a great height) it draws all the Nouriſhment from the Leaves; ſo that, as that advances, the Leaves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: and when the Flowers are fully blown, ſcarce any of the Leaves remain alive; but whenever this happens, the old Root ſends forth a numerous quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Off-ſets for increaſe: And it is not till this time, that ſome of theſe ſorts can be increaſed. There is a vulgar Error or two relating to the large <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Aloe,</hi> which is, that it never flowers until it is an Hundred Years old: this is a Miſtake; ſince we have had ſeveral of them flower in <hi>England,</hi> ſome of which were known not to exceed fifty Years old; and others, that flower'd many Years ago, cannot be ſuppos'd to have been in <hi>England</hi> ſo long as to arrive at that Age, ſince they were thought too tender for our Climate at that time, when Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes were not known. Another common Error is, that when the Flower opens, it makes a Report like that of firing a Gun: This is ſufficiently confuted by all thoſe, who have been where theſe Plants have flower'd: But probably the riſe of this Story might proceed from ſome Perſons ſaying, when one of theſe Plants flower'd, it made a great Noiſe; meaning thereby, that whenever one of them flower'd in <hi>England,</hi> it was ſpread abroad as an uncommon thing, and occaſion'd a great Noiſe among the neighbouring Inhabitants; moſt of whom uſually repair to ſee it, as a thing that rarely happens, and as a great Curioſity. In the Year 1729. in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> one of theſe great <hi>American Aloes</hi> flower'd in Mr. <hi>Cowell</hi>'s Garden at <hi>Hoxton,</hi> and though it was above forty Years old, did not ſhoot forth its Stem till about eleven Weeks before, in which ſhort time it ſhot up

                     <p>The Contexture of the SENSIBLE PLANT is very ſurpriſing; for, upon touching any of the Sprigs with Leaves on, all the Leaves on that Sprig contracting themſelves by Pairs, joined their upper Superfices cloſe together. Upon the dropping a Drop of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> on the Sprig betwixt the Leaves, all the Leaves above ſhut preſently, thoſe below by Pairs ſucceſſively after, by and by the lower Leaves of the other Branches, and ſo every Pair ſucceſſively, with ſome little diſtance of time betwixt, to the top of each Sprig, and ſo they continued ſhut for ſome time: But returning to the Garden the next Day, and ſeveral Days after, found all the Leaves dilated again on two of the Sprigs; but where the <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> had dropped, upwards, dead and withered; but thoſe below on the ſame Sprig, green, and cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Touch as before, and continu'd ſo. With a Pair of Sciſſars, as ſuddenly as it could be done, one of the Leaves was clipped off in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; upon which that Pair, and the Pair above, cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſently; after a little Interval thoſe under, and ſo the reſt of the Pairs to the bottom of the Sprig; and then the Motion began in the lower Pairs on the other Sprigs, and ſo ſhut them by Pairs upwards, though not with ſuch diſtinct diſtances. Upon cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off one of the harder Branches, there came out a Liquor, without preſſure; very clear, and of a bright greeniſh Colour, taſting at firſt a little bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, but after leaving a liquorice like Taſte behind:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0377400900:203"/>which probably, the Motion of this Plant upon touching might proceed from this; that there being a conſtant Intercourſe betwixt every Part of this Plant and its Root, either by a Circulation of this Liquor, or a conſtant preſſing of the ſubtiler Parts of it to every Extremity of the Plant. The above Experiments were made by Dr. <hi>Hooke,</hi> on ſome of theſe Plants which grew in a Garden in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park. I have read, that in the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to <hi>Panama,</hi> there is a whole Wood full of <hi>Senſitive Trees,</hi> of which, as ſoon as they are touch'd, the Leaves cloſe and move with a rattling Noiſe, and twiſt themſelves together into a winding Figure.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Notion that an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> or <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn,</hi> is a fired Vapour exhaled from boggy Places, being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Judgment of many Learned and Ingenious Perſons, has ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that the Generality of Mankind ſeem to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in that Solution of this ſurprizing Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon.</p>
                  <p>An Attempt therefore to prove the contrary, and that the <hi>Light</hi> called by this Name proceeds from ſome nocturnal <hi>Flying-Inſect,</hi> will perhaps be deemed vain and raſh. However, I ſhall take the Liberty to aſſign the Reaſons which induce me to believe it, and my Objections to its being a Vapour; which I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Judgment of the Curious, till time and experience ſhall demonſtrate the real Truth.</p>
                  <p>If in my Purſuit of the Wanderer I ſhould chance to be miſled, it will be in common with all that have followed the Chace, with this advantage, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0377400900:207"/>I can ſuſtain no Injuries from it. And the Attempt may invite others, who may be more ſucceſsful in their Endeavours. The Conjecture muſt be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the Probability will be of ſome uſe, if it helps to diſpoſſeſs fearful Country People of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Hint of my Opinion I received from <hi>Meriana</hi>'s Account of the famous <hi>Indian</hi> LANT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HORN FLY, publiſh'd amongſt her Inſects of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinam;</hi> which Account, being not in the leaſt foreign to the Subject, nor perhaps unpleaſant to the Reader, I ſhall here inſert.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lanthorn Fly</hi> is a Nocturnal Inſect, that has an Hood, or Bladder on its Head, which gives a Light like a Lanthorn in the Night, but by Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is clear and tranſparent, very curiouſly adorned with Stripes of a red and green Colour. Such a ſhining came forth from this Bladder in the Night, that it was poſſible by the Light of it to have read Writing of tolerable large Characters. She ſays, that when once upon a time, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhe ſent to ſeek for Inſects, brought her of theſe <hi>Lanthorn Flies</hi> in great abundance, ſhe ſhut them up in a large Cheſt, not knowing as yet that they ſhone by Night; but being awak'd and frighten'd in the Night out of her Sleep by an unuſual Noiſe; jumping out of Bed, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Light to be brought; not knowing what that uncommon Diſturbance which ſhe heard in her Houſe ſhould be: It immediately appear'd that the Noiſe came from the Cheſt; upon which, with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of Mind they open'd it; but ſtill more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, they ſuddenly clapp'd the Lid down again; becauſe in the opening, there came as it were a Flame of Fire, as often as a new Inſect flew out: which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0377400900:208"/>at length being obſerv'd, and coming to themſelves again, they gather'd the little Creatures together once more; admiring that ſo conſiderable a Light ſhould proceed from them.</p>
                  <p>The Wings and whole Body of this Inſect are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly adorned with a Mixture of beautiful Colours; as red, green, yellow, &amp;c. It's ſaid, the Creature can contract or dilate the Hood or Bladder over its Head at pleaſure: and that they hide all their Light when taken, but when at liberty afford it plentifully. Accordingly, thoſe which <hi>Meriana</hi> inclos'd having the Liberty of a large dark Cheſt, diſplay'd their Light, and it being their proper time to fly, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to eſcape as ſoon as the Lid was open.</p>
                  <p>The more I conſider'd this wonderful Account, the ſtronger it inclin'd me to believe the <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi> of our own Country, was likewiſe no other than the ſhining of ſome night-flying Inſect. And indeed I was too well pleas'd with the Diſcovery I thought I had made, vainly imagining my Opinion to be ſingular; nor knowing that any Perſon had formed the Conjecture before my ſelf; till, looking into the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> I was agreeably ſurprized, to find that two learned and eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the late Mr. <hi>Fr. Willughby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> were both of the ſame Opinion. The late learned and ingenious Dr. <hi>Derham</hi> indeed, who publiſh'd that Account, was of a contrary Opinion: believing thoſe Appearances to be fired Vapours. But with due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Judgment of ſo great a Man, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he has given of this Phaenomenon, ſeems in every Circumſtance to agree much better with that of a living Creature, than an inflammable Vapour.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0377400900:209"/>Which Account of the <hi>Ignes Fatui,</hi> I ſhall tranſcribe from the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> for the ſake of ſuch of my Readers as are not poſſeſs'd of thoſe Books.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall firſt give the Reaſons which incline me to believe theſe Appearances only the ſhining of ſome Nocturnal Flies; becauſe they are the Reſult of ſuch Thoughts as occurr'd from conſidering the Subject itſelf, before I knew the Sentiments of thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons abovemention'd.</p>
                  <p>I apprehend then that the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> muſt be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a flying Inſect than a Vapour, becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties attributed to it, ſuch as its Motion, directing itſelf which way it pleaſes, ſhunning whatever Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction happens in its Paſſage, and the like, in which almoſt all Accounts agree, correſpond much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that of an Inſect flying, or the Actions of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing guided by Senſe; than to that of a fired Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, which muſt be abſolutely carried with the Wind, let it blow which way it will: And may we not very naturally ſuppoſe, that if it was only a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour driven by the Wind, it would ſome time or other have been blown exactly to the Spot where ſome Perſons were paſſing, that might have diſcover'd what it was; or directly to ſome Houſe, Village, Town? &amp;<hi>c.</hi> I cannot imagine how a mere Vapour could ſhun any of theſe Obſtructions. And would a fired Vapour, if once extinct, (as theſe Appearances are frequently obſerved to be ſuddenly dark, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſhine again) be enkindled in a Body any more?</p>
                  <p>Methinks, if <hi>Igues Fatui</hi> were only Vapours, they would ſometimes be raiſed higher in the Air than theſe Lights are obſerved to be, which ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0377400900:210"/>ſix Feet above the Ground; unleſs it be to mount over a Hedge, or ſome ſuch thing. But their paſſing along a few Feet above the Ground, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water, very much agrees with that of ſome Inſects in queſt of their Prey; and does not their ſettling of a ſudden, and riſing again immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, anſwer likewiſe? It looks very much as if they had found ſomething which they were in ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. From hence there appears great Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it nothing elſe but a Night-flying Infect; and that the Light it carries is given either to ſeek its Food with, or woo its Female, or perhaps both.</p>
                  <p>All Accounts agree, that the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> is never ſeen but in a dark Night, which is ſtill a ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its being a living Creature; for a Vapour might be exhalld when it was not ſo dark, as well as when it was, and be viſible too. But ſuppoſing it a Creature that flies by Night, it may either not ſally out in light Nights, or its Organs of Sight be ſo adapted, as to ſee at ſuch a time without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this extraordinary Light, and not expend its ſhining Matter when its natural Eyes will ſerve; but uſe this Lamp or Lanthorn in dark Nights only, when Neceſſity obliges it: For perhaps, the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials that this ſhining Matter is compos'd of, may coſt the Creature ſome Labour to gather, tho' Nature may fit it for Uſe afterwards. And 'tis not unlikely that the ſuppos'd little Animal may have a Receptacle to preſerve its ſhining Matter in, which it lets out when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requires; for this Light is no real Fire, but the Appearance only.</p>
                  <p>But altho' we are not able to give a ſatisfactory Account of what this Light conſiſts of, this carries no real Objection to its being a Night-ſhining Fly:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0377400900:211"/>becauſe we are well aſſured, that there are flying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects peculiar to ſeveral Countries that actually do ſhine in dark Nights, and yield Lights, not much different from thoſe of our <hi>Ignes Fatui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To me it ſeems not altogether improbable, that this ſuppos'd Inſect may be furniſh'd with a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Phoſphorus, perhaps in quality not unlike the great Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Noctilucal Matter, or Night-ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stuff; which when reduced to a Powder, and put into a Phial, gently heated at the Fire, and then ſhook; whereby the ſmall Particles of this ſhining Matter being put into Motion, would in a dark Room yield a Light very vivid. [<hi>See</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Experiments and Obſervations made upon the <hi>Icy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Noctiluca.</hi>] That the like Agitation may be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe ſhining Flies naturally, without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, either by Reſpiration, or by the Motion of its Wings or Legs, ſeems not at all improbable.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to this is what Mr. <hi>Templer</hi> obſerv'd of the Glo-worm. Putting, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the Glo-worm into a ſmall thin Box, (ſuch as Pills are uſually ſent in) <hi>May</hi> 27. between Eleven and Twelve at Night, I ſaw her ſhine thro' the Box very clearly on one ſide, the Box ſhut; putting white Paper into the Box, and the Worm into the Paper, it ſhined through the Paper and Box both. The next Morning, about Eight of the Clock, ſhe ſeemed dead, and holding her in a very dark Place, I could perceive very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Light, and that only when ſhe was turned on her Back, and by conſequence put into ſome little voluntary Motion. After Sun-ſet that Night, ſhe walked briskly up and down in her Box, ſhining clearly as the Night before. The 29th in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſeemed dead again, at Night recovered her
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0377400900:212"/>ſelf, and ſhined as well as ever in the Box. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>ſays he,</hi> ſaw her ſhine without ſome ſenſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either in her Body or Legs. In her clearſt ſhining ſhe extended her Body a third part beyond its uſual length. The Glo-worm having contracted her Body into a bending Poſture, ſhined little, the Light ſcarcely ſo big as a great Pin's head; upon touching of her ſhe extended her ſelf, walked in her Box, and at firſt Extent ſhined as gloriouſly as ever. <hi>Philoſoph. Tranſact.</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 72.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe that I would make of theſe obſervations on the Glo-worm, is to ſtrengthen the Probability that the ſuppoſed <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi> Fly, and other ſhining Flies, as well as the Glo-worm, emit their Light, by putting the ſmall Particles of ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matter into motion, from ſome voluntary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It has been objected, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that theſe Lights were too large for any Inſect whatever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second,</hi> That they were always carried along with the Wind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third,</hi> That they were never ſeen but in Salt-Marſhes, or other Boggy Grounds.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> which ſeems to be the ſtrongeſt of all the Objections; if this Light proceeds from a flying Inſect, how comes it that the Creature has never yet been diſcover'd? or how was it poſſible to have eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the narrow Searches of ſo many curious Perſons, as have with indefatigable labour collected all the Inſects poſſible to be procur'd, both of our own Country, and likewiſe from Abroad; and have with ſo great Care examin'd the Contexture of moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, as well as larger Animals, and as it were ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſed their diſtinct Parts; have been able to render
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0377400900:213"/>a conſiſtent and rational Account of the various Uſe thoſe Parts ſeem'd to be deſigned for; and yet it ſhould never enter into any of their Heads, that ſuch a Creature was a nocturnal Luminous Inſect, and probably the <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> that had ſo. long amuſed and puzzled Mankind to account for?</p>
                  <p>The firſt Objection urges the Impoſſibility of an Inſect carrying a Light ſo large as the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> appears to be.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Accounts agree, that theſe Lights commonly appear of the bigneſs of that of a middling Candle, and ſometimes they have been ſeen much ſmaller; tho' ſome indeed have ſaid, they have ſeen in other Countries theſe Appearances equal to that of a Torch. Every one knows that Light magnifies in the Night, the darker the Night, the bigger the Light ſeems to be; and what appear'd ſo luminous at a diſtance, the nearer you approach it the leſs it grows. The ſame has been obſerv'd of the <hi>Ignis Fatuus;</hi> which, as before ſaid, is no real Fire, but the Appearance only. It is well known, the <hi>Lanthorn Fly</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> when at Liberty, ſometimes emits a Light not far ſhort of what is reported of the biggeſt of our <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn:</hi> and this Light being contain'd in the Bladder on its Head, the Creature, as is ſaid, can either contract, or dilate at Pleaſure. The Glo-worm can encreaſe or diminiſh its ſhining; and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the ſuppoſed <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi> Fly can do the ſame; or its Light appearing bigger or leſs, may be in proportion to the Size or Perfection of the Creature that emits it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Objection is, That this Light was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carried along with the Wind. If that were true, it would be impoſſible for it to ſhun any kind
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0377400900:214"/>of Obſtruction in its way, whether Man, Beaſt, Bank, Hedge, Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but would unavoidably ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have been driven againſt ſome or other of them; which I never heard it was; but on the contrary ſhunn'd them as carefully as if guided by Senſe. Beſides, it can be proved by undeniable Teſtimony, that this Light moves any way it pleaſes, juſt as a flying Inſect would do, buſied in ſeeking its Food, ſporting itſelf, or ſome other Employment. It muſt be own'd, indeed, that a flying Inſect is generally carry'd with the Wind, not caring, or not able (eſpecially when it blows any thing hard) to beat againſt it; unleſs it be ſuch who have Homes, and young Offsprings to take care of, and whoſe Bodies are fitly balanc'd to reſiſt ſuch Winds. Thus far the Motion of an Inſect, will agree with that of a Vapour carried by the Wind.</p>
                  <p>The third Objection, that the <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen but in Salt-Marſhes, or other Boggy Places; is a great Miſtake. I can produce Perſons of Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that have ſeen theſe Lights flying over Fields, Heaths, and other dry Places. A few Days ſince a grave Gentleman, a Perſon of exceeding good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, told me, that in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> about eleven a Clock in a dark Night, he ſaw one of theſe Lights flying over a fallow piece of Ground: being within three or four Fields of his Habitation, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with the Ground thereabouts, and well aſſured there was no hazard of being led into Bogs, Rivers, or other dangerous Places; his Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity led him to follow it, reſolving, if poſſible, to diſcover what it was, (for though he had heard it was only a Vapour exhal'd from the Earth, he had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0377400900:215"/>ſtill ſome Doubt about it.) It led him over a plow'd Field, flying and twiſting about from place to place; ſometimes it would ſuddenly diſappear, and as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly appear again: ſometimes it would drop down, and preſently riſe again. Once it made directly to a Hedge but a ſmall diſtance from him, which, as ſoon as it came pretty near, it mounted over; and he loſt ſight of it, after he had follow'd it a full Hour without the leaſt Satisfaction. He then turn'd about to make the beſt of his way home, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he ſpied it again: but finding it next to an impoſſibility to approach near enough to ſatisfy his Curioſity about it, and being pretty well tired; gave over the Purſuit, and would follow it no further. The ſame Perſon ſays, That in <hi>Surry</hi> he has ſeen in a dark Night ſix or ſeven of theſe Lights at one time, flying over a boggy Common. And that he has ſeen theſe Appearances flying over Lands where there has been neither Ponds nor Bogs.</p>
                  <p>If the Objection to its being an Inſect, becauſe ſeen only in Boggy Places, would hold good; it would infallibly deſtroy the laſt Objection of its being always carried along with the Wind. For as theſe Lights frequently hold collected in a Body, for an Hour or more, as has been oftentimes obſerv'd, they might, nay certainly would (ſometimes in half that time) be driven over Fields, and other dry Places, according to the ſtrength of the Wind. But it will admit of a Doubt, whether an inflammable Vapour, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue collected in a Body many Minutes, expos'd to ſo much Wind as would be ſufficient to carry it along, without being very ſoon diſſipated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0377400900:216"/>I don't deny that theſe Appearances are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen in Boggy, and Marſhy Grounds: The Creature may very probably feed on watry Inſects; and as all Animals are naturally endued with the Senſe of knowing the ſure Places where to find their Food, ſo may the <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi> Fly likewiſe frequent watry Places for that very end; at which Places, as the moſt likely, the Males may meet and woo their Females alſo; the flying State being the Perfection, and laſt State of all the winged Tribes of Inſects; in which they generate, lay their Eggs, and after which few kinds of them long ſurvive.</p>
                  <p>This Light being often obſerv'd to ſtand ſtill as well as move, and ſometimes ſeeming fixed on the Surface of the Water; we may naturally ſuppoſe at ſuch a time it ſettles upon the Ground, Graſs, or Weeds, as other Inſects do; and may perhaps either have found, and be devouring its Prey, or watching to catch it; which it could not do without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of this extraordinary Light.</p>
                  <p>To the laſt Objection; If an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> were only the ſhining of ſome Inſect, how comes it that the Creature never yet was diſcover'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I reply, That the ſuppos'd <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi> Fly's not being yet diſcover'd, may in a great meaſure be accounted for. All Night-Animals in general have Places of Retreat, where they hide themſelves in the Day-time: to theſe Places of Retirement, they ſeem as naturally to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves, as other Animals to Reſt and Sleep. Some find a proper convenient Receptacle under the Earth in Holes; ſome in Timber, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others lying on the Ground, amongſt Weeds, or in Hedges, hollow Trees, or under the Bark, or in the Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0377400900:217"/>It would be endleſs to recount the various Methods Nature has taught theſe little Creatures to ſecure themſelves from Dangers.</p>
                  <p>We all know that ſuch Animals as fly a Nights, are ſluggiſh and heavy in the Day-time, not caring to ſtir, and with difficulty are put on the Wing; hardly any thing leſs than their Preſervation will force them to it; as the Bat, Owl, Beetle, Chafer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Creatures fly only for about an Hour in the Dusk of the Evening; and ſo do not ſtand in need of that extraordinary Light as the ſuppoſed <hi>Jack in the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> Fly, which is always obſerv'd to ſally out in very dark Nights. And if thoſe Animals are ſo ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, that fly in the Evening only; what may we ſuppoſe of the <hi>Will with a Whiſp,</hi> which flies chiefly when late at Night.</p>
                  <p>The Glo-worm, as Mr. <hi>Templer</hi> obſerv'd, always ſeem'd as if dead in the Day-time; yet conſtantly at Night would be brisk, and ſhine as vivid as ever.</p>
                  <p>If by chance in the Day-time any Perſon ſhould diſcloſe the ſluggiſh <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi> Fly, in its Place of Shelter or Retreat, (which perhaps may have often happen'd, both in its creeping, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State likewiſe) very likely they would deſtroy it, as common People do moſt Inſects as noxious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; eſpecially when large and uncommon: But if they ſhould happen not to kill it, not one in ten thouſand but would leave it where they found it, without regarding it at all.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon, it is not only difficult to diſcover this Inſect in the Day-time; but if a thouſand had been found, it would be next to an Impoſſibility to know they were ſhining Flies; becauſe the Part that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0377400900:218"/>contains the luminous Matter, like that of the <hi>Indian</hi> Lanthorn Flies, appears by Day-light only clear and pellucid, without any ſhining at all. Beſides, it may perhaps be an Inſect not of the multiparous kind, conſequently the ſeldomer to be met with.</p>
                  <p>The Difficulty of catching this ſuppoſed Inſect by Night, has been as great hitherto, as that of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by Day. For <hi>Ignes Fatui,</hi> as all agree, appear only in dark Nights, and commonly when late; at which time the benighted Traveller wants to be at Home, or perhaps the Stories he has heard of the <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi>'s leading ſuch as follow it into Rivers, and other dangerous Places, deterr him from going after it. But if it happen'd he was neither in haſte, nor afraid; it would be almoſt impoſſible to follow it in a dark Night, amongſt Bogs, Lakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where this Inſect is uſually ſporting and frisking over the Waters. Should we not conclude the Perſon, that would perhaps riſque his Life in attempting to catch what he thinks a Vapour, more infatuated than the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> he is in purſuit after.</p>
                  <p>It was never yet known that any Perſon approach'd ſo near this Light, as to diſcover certainly what it was. But as ſome Perſons have attempted to draw near it for that intent (when by chance they have ſeen it in a Place eaſy of Acceſs, tho' not one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand have had the Courage to venture) the cunning Vapour, as if ſenſible of their Deſign, and for its own Security, withdraws its Light, as it were a dark Lanthorn, and takes that opportunity to eſcape; leaving the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> Hunter in the dark amongſt Bogs and Fens, to find his way out again; whilſt <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn</hi> appears again, two or three
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0377400900:219"/>hundred Yards off, ſporting over the Brooks and Meadows, exerciſed in its beloved Employment.</p>
                  <p>It appears upon the whole, that the various Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties obſervable in theſe Lights carry evident Marks of Senſe; to attribute them therefore to fired Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours moving without any Direction, is an Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that renders the Subject but more unintelligible.</p>
                  <p>The late ingenious <hi>R. Bradley,</hi> F. R. S. his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe Appearances was as follows. The <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Fatuus,</hi> ſays he, or <hi>Jack in the Lanthorn,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be no more than a Group of ſmall enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Inſects, rather than ſuppoſe it an inflammable Vapour, as ſome have taken it to be; for if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſuch Effluvia or Corpuſcula as riſe from the Earth or Waters, that were inflammable, and by ſome Cauſe or other had taken Fire, they could not be of ſo long laſting or duration as we find them to be; and beſides, we might as reaſonably expect, that all the Effluvia ariſing at the ſame time from the ſame Body of Water, ſhould equally be inflammable as theſe; and ſo the whole Surface of the Pond, Lake, or River, appear all in a Flame at one time. The ſudden motion of this Light from Place to Place, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much agrees with the Motion obſervable in Groups of Gnats, which move in a Body, ſometimes very ſlowly, and at other times drive together with great ſwiftneſs. Happening, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to diſcourſe upon this Subject with the ingenious Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi> the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, that Gentleman told me, that he had often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd this enlightned Body in ſome Places abroad, and had caught ſome of the Inſects which help'd to compoſe it. But allowing it to be as I ſay, the occaſion of the Light in ſuch Inſects remains yet to be diſcover'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0377400900:220"/>Of all the Accounts that I have had from Variety of People that have ſeen theſe Lights, and with which I could have fill'd a large Volume, I find no material difference in their ſeveral Relations; only that ſome, and indeed the moſt, have ſeen them in watry and boggy Places, others have ſeen them in dry Grounds; to ſome theſe Lights appear'd of the bigneſs of that of a middling Candle (which moſt agree in) to others bigger, and to ſome ſmaller. I ſhall therefore add no other Relations but what follows, from the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Tranſactions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Meteor call'd the <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made in <hi>England</hi> by the Rev. Mr. <hi>W. Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> F.R.S. and others in <hi>Italy,</hi> communicated by Sir <hi>Tho. Dereham,</hi> Bart. F.R.S. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 411. p. 204. <hi>Philoſ. Tranſact.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It being the Opinion of divers skilful Naturaliſts (particularly Mr. <hi>Fran. Willughby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ray</hi>) that the <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> are only the ſhining of a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Male Glo-worms in <hi>England,</hi> or of the <hi>Pyrauſtae</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> flying together: I was minded to conſult my curious and ingenious Friend Sir <hi>Thomas Dereham</hi> about the Phaenomenon, being informed, that thoſe <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> are common in all the <hi>Italian</hi> Parts. But of the <hi>Pyrauſtae,</hi> or Fire-Flies, he ſaith, he never obſerved any ſuch Effects, altho' there is an immenſe Number of them in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July.</hi> He ſaith moreover, that theſe <hi>Pyrauſtae</hi> are called <hi>Luccio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae, i.e.</hi> ſmall Lights; and that they are not the Far-falls (as Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> thought) which are Butterflies. But I have good reaſon to think, that Inſects are not concerned in the <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> from the following Obſervations; the firſt of which I made my ſelf,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0377400900:221"/>and the others I received from <hi>Italy,</hi> by the Favour of Sir <hi>Tho. Dereham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My own Obſervations I made at a Place that lay in a Valley between rocky Hills, which I ſuſpect might contain Minerals, in ſome boggy Ground near the bottom of thoſe Hills. Where ſeeing one in a calm dark Night, with gentle Approaches I got up by degrees within two or three Yards of it, and viewed it with all the Care I poſſibly could. I found it frisking about a dead Thiſtle growing in the Field, until a ſmall Motion of the Air (even ſuch as was cauſed only by the Approximation of my ſelf) made it skip to another place, and thence to another, and another.</p>
                  <p>It is now about fifty five Years ſince I ſaw this Phaenomenon; but I have as freſh and perfect an Idea of it, as if it was but a few Days. And as I took it then, ſo I am of the ſame Opinion now, that it was a fired Vapour.</p>
                  <p>The Male Glo-worms I know emit their ſhining Light as they fly; by which means they diſcover and woo their Females: but I never obſerved them to fly together in ſo great Numbers, as to make a Light equal to an <hi>Ignis Fatuus.</hi> And I was ſo near, that had it been the ſhining of Glo-worms, I muſt have ſeen it in little diſtinct Spots of Light: but it was one continuous Body of Light.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the Doctor has related his own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of an <hi>Ignis Fatuus.</hi> Before I mention the Obſervations which Sir <hi>Tho. Dereham</hi> procured for him in <hi>Italy;</hi> I cannot help remarking, that in the above Account the Dr. has given of an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> there appears a much ſtronger Argument of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0377400900:222"/>a living Creature, than a Vapour: For when with gentle Approaches he got up by degrees within two or three Yards of it, he found it frisking about a dead Thiſtle growing in the Field, until a ſmall Motion of the Air (even ſuch as was cauſed only by his continual gentle approach) made it skip to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place, and ſo to another, and another. Its frisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and playing about a Thiſtle, agrees much better with that of an Inſect, exerciſed in ſeeking its Food, or ſome other delightful Employment; as does its skipping from place to place likewiſe. For I can hardly think it poſſible that the Air agitated only by his Body, conſidering how gently he approach'd the Light, could have been ſufficient ſo to affect it, at two or three Yards diſtance, as to have driven it from him; but if this was really the Cauſe of its firſt remove, its ſecond, third, and after removes from place to place, muſt be owing to ſomething elſe: And as it was a calm Night, we cannot attribute its flight to the Wind; nor does the Doctor in the leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that as the Cauſe, any further than what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his own ſlow eaſy Motion, which was to my thinking inſufficient to effect it: Beſides, if the Motion of the Air was the only Cauſe of this Light's moving from place to place; it could not be carried along in one continuous Body of Light, but would at leaſt be ſpread, if not ſoon diſſipated: But an Inſect buſied in ſeeking its Food, or ſome other Employment, we may naturally ſuppoſe, that as ſoon as ever it perceived itſelf diſcover'd (which it might do by the help of its Light) it wou'd move off, in order to ſecure itſelf from any appearing danger: And this Solution of the Motion of the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> ſeems
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0377400900:223"/>to me more agreeable to Truth than that of a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour. And as to the Light's exceeding that which the Male Glo-worm emits flying; and that he never obſerv'd them to fly together in ſo great Numbers, as to make a Light equal to an <hi>Ignis Fatuus;</hi> there ſeems good reaſon to believe, that all ſhining Flies can at pleaſure add or diminiſh their Light, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Light's being more or leſs, may be owing to the Size or Perfection of the Creature. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is not a collective Body of ſmall Inſects that compoſes the <hi>Ignis Fatuus;</hi> but rather one ſingle Animal, which of what Tribe it belongeth to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet to be diſcover'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lanthorn-Fly</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſeems to be of the Papilionaceous kind; tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> ſay it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Inſect <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. pag. 52. which agrees better with the Chafer or Beetle kind, than that of the Butter-fly. But whether the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> be of the Papilionaceous, Libella, Beetle-kind, or any other, in muſt remain a Doubt, till time diſcovers it: And all that is intended in this Attempt, is only to ſhow the probability of its being a living Animal, rather than a Vapour; becauſe many of the Circumſtances agree well with the former, and hardly one with the latter.</p>
                  <p>The Obſervations which Sir <hi>Tho. Dereham</hi> procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Doctor in <hi>Italy</hi> agreeing in the general with moſt other Relations, and the whole being too long to inſert, I ſhall only extract the Heads of what that Gentleman has deliver'd; and then leave the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſome abler Hand, whoſe Time and Abilities are better ſuited to examine the Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0377400900:224"/>In <hi>Italy</hi> there are of theſe Lights both on the Mountains, and in the Plains; and are pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all the Territory of <hi>Bologna.</hi> To begin with the Plains: They are frequently obſerved there; the Country People call them <hi>Cularſi;</hi> perhaps from ſome fancied Similitude to thoſe Birds, and becauſe they look upon them as Birds, the Belly and other Parts of which are reſplendent like our ſhining Flies. They are moſt frequent in watry and moraſſe Ground, and there are ſome ſuch Places, where one may be almoſt ſure of ſeeing them every Night, if it be dark. In the Fields near the Bridge <hi>Della Calcarata,</hi> in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belonging to a Pariſh of S. <hi>Maria in dono,</hi> North of <hi>Bologna,</hi> one of theſe fiery Appearances is very often obſerved to move acroſs the Fields, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from another Bridge. There is another of them in the Fields of <hi>Bagnara,</hi> almoſt Eaſt of <hi>Bologna,</hi> which ſcarce ever fails to appear in dark Nights; particularly when it rains, or ſnows, as alſo in cold and froſty Weather: Both theſe Lights are very large; that at <hi>Bagnara</hi> appeared to a Gentleman, as he was travelling that way; it kept him Company for a Mile or better; conſtantly moving before him, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtronger Light on the Road than the Link he had with him.</p>
                  <p>Leſſer ones there appear a good many, ſome of them giving as much Light as a lighted Torch, and ſome there are no bigger than the Flame of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Candle. All of them have the ſame Property, in reſembling both in Colour and Light, a Flame ſtrong enough to reflect a Luſtre upon neighbouring Objects all around. They are continually in Motion, but this Motion is various and uncertain. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they riſe up, at others they ſink: ſometimes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0377400900:225"/>they diſappear of a ſudden, and appear again in an inſtant in ſome other Place. Commonly they keep hovering about ſix Feet from the Ground. As they differ in largeneſs, ſo they do in figure, ſpreading ſometimes pretty wide, and then again contracting themſelves: ſometimes breaking to all Appearance in two, and a very little while after meeting again into one Body; ſometimes floating like Waves, and letting drop ſome Parts like Sparks out of a Fire. I have been aſſured, that there is no dark Night all the Year round when they do not appear. And in the very middle of the Winter, when the Weather is very cold, and the Ground cover'd with Snow, they are obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more frequently than in the hotteſt Summer. Nor doth Rain or Snow in any wiſe prevent or hinder their Appearance; on the contrary, they are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, and caſt a ſtronger Light in rainy and wet Weather. Neither doth the Wind much hurt them, tho' one ſhould think, that if it was a burning Subſtance, like common Fire, it ſhould either be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated in windy Weather, or extinguiſhed by Rain; (and the ſame we might expect if it was a Vapour.) But ſince they do not receive any damage from wet Weather, and ſince on the other hand it hath never been obſerved, that any thing was thereby ſet on Fire, tho' they muſt needs in moving to and fro meet with a good many combuſtible Subſtances; it may from thence be very reaſonably inferred, that they have ſome reſemblance to that ſort of Phoſphorus which doth indeed ſhine in the dark, but doth not burn any thing, as common Fire doth. As to the appearance of this Phaenomenon in mountainous Parts, by what I have hitherto been able to learn, they differ in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0377400900:226"/>elſe but in largeneſs; and all thoſe I converſed with, that ſaw them in the Mountains, agree in that they never obſerved any larger than the Flame of an ordinary Candle. Nor do thoſe that live in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains call them <hi>Cularſi,</hi> which Name is perhaps uſed only by the Country People in the Plains, for thoſe large ones above deſcribed. One thing I will beg leave to add, that according to the beſt Informations I have been able to procure, theſe Lights are great Friends to Brooks and Rivers, being frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved along the Banks of them, perhaps becauſe the Air carries them thither more eaſily than any where elſe. In all other particulars, as in their Motion, the manner of their Appearance, their diſappearing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very ſuddenly, their Light, the Height they riſe to, and their not being affected either by rainy or cold Weather, they are the very ſame with the <hi>Cularſi</hi> above deſcribed, or the large <hi>Will with a Whiſp,</hi> as obſerved in the Plains.</p>
                  <p>A young Gentleman, a very accurate and knowing Obſerver of Natural Appearances, travelling ſome time in the Month of <hi>March</hi> between eight and nine in the Evening, in a mountainous Road not far from our Lady <hi>Del ſarſo,</hi> about ten Miles South of <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> as he approach'd a certain River called <hi>Rioverde,</hi> he perceived a Light, which ſhone very ſtrongly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Stones that lay upon the Banks. It ſeemed to be about two Feet above the Stones, and not far from the Water of the River: In figure and largeneſs it had the Appearance of a Parallelopepid, ſomewhat above a <hi>Bologneſe</hi> Foot in length, and about half a Foot high, its longeſt ſide lying parallel to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: Its Light was very ſtrong, inſomuch that he could very plainly diſtinguiſh by it part of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hedge, and the Water in the River; only in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0377400900:227"/>the Eaſt corner of it the Light was pretty faint, and the ſquare Figure leſs perfect, as if cut off, or dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd by the Segment of a Circle: The Gentleman's Curioſity tempted him to examine it a little nearer; in order to which he advanced gently towards the Place, but was ſurprized to find, that inſenſibly it changed from a bright red to a yellowiſh, and then to a pale Colour, in proportion as he drew nearer; and that when he came to the Place itſelf, it was quite vaniſhed. Upon this he ſtepped back, and not only ſaw it again, but ſound the farther he went from it, the ſtronger and brighter it grew; nor could he upon narrowly viewing the Place where this fiery Appearance was, perceive the leaſt blackneſs, or ſmell, or any Mark of an actual Fire. The ſame Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was confirmed to me by another Gentleman who frequently travels that way, and who aſſured me, that he had ſeen the very ſame Light five or fix different times, in Spring and Autumn, and that he had always obſerved it in the very ſame Shape and the ſame Place; which to me ſeems very difficult to be accounted for. He told me farther, that once he took particular notice of its coming out of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Place, and then ſettling itſelf into the Figure above deſcribed. How it comes to paſs, that the nearer one approaches to theſe, or the like fiery Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, the fainter they grow, till at laſt they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear totally, I freely own my ſelf at a loſs. This is the Subſtance of what I have been able to gather from ſeveral Accounts relating to the <hi>Ignes Fatui;</hi> but as to the Cauſes of them I will not pretend to aſſign any: I will only add, that all that ever ſaw any of theſe fiery Appearances agree, and you may aſſure Mr. <hi>Derham</hi> of it, that they caſt a Light quite different from that of the ſhining Flies; and if you
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0377400900:228"/>pleaſe to reflect on the ſeveral Circumſtances above related, I believe you will find, that they are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, if at all, to be ſolved by that Hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this Concluſion of Sir <hi>Tho. Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's,</hi> from the Circumſtances of his Relation, I am more ſtrongly inclin'd to believe the Light proceeds from a living Animal than I was before. For let any Perſon but examine the particulars of the Account Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> has given of the <hi>Ignes Fatui;</hi> and try how far he can reconcile them to the Appearance, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mere Vapour.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> he ſays, there are obſerv'd two kinds of theſe Lights, one on the Mountains, the other in the Plains; thoſe in the Plains are the largeſt. The Country People call them <hi>Calarſi,</hi> becauſe they look upon them as Birds, the Belly and other Parts of which are reſplendent like their ſhining Flies; that is, their <hi>Pyrauſtae,</hi> or Fire-Flies, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of theſe fiery Appearances was often obſerv'd to move acroſs the Fields, coming from one Bridge to a Spot of Ground near the other. Would a fired Vapour, think ye, be ſo often raiſed at the ſame Place, of the ſame ſize, and ſo conſtantly go to the ſame Spot, and there fix it ſelf? Can ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be reconcil'd to the Notion of a Vapour? Is it not more agreeable to that of Senſe? It rather looks as as if ſome ſhining Animal ſallied out at ſuch a time from its lurking Hole, or Place of retreat.</p>
                  <p>Another of theſe larger Lights appear'd to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as he was travelling, and kept him Company for a Mile or more, conſtantly moving before him. How a Vapour could do this, is beyond my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or I believe any one's elſe. As to the different Magnitudes of this Light, that is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly owing to the different Creatures that emit it,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0377400900:229"/>or perhaps to the ſize or perfection of the Inſect.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> appearing in a dark Night in any Weather, as Rain, Snow, and the like; at which times they are obſerv'd to caſt a ſtronger Light; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much better with an Animal than a Vapour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſhining Matter in an Inſect being enclos'd, can receive no damage from any kind of Weather: whereas a Vapour would either not be exhaled, or would ſoon be diſſipated by the weight of the Rain, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> But an Inſect at ſuch a time ſtands in need of more Light, and therefore diſplays its utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> that appear'd to the young Gentleman, in figure and ſize of a Parallelopepid, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> which Obſervation was confirmed by another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who frequently travelled that way, that he had ſeen the very ſame Light five or ſix different times, in Spring and Autumn; and that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved it in the very ſame ſhape, and the ſame place; and that once he took particular Notice of its coming out of a neighbouring Place, and then ſettling itſelf into the figure above deſcribed; let any Perſon but duly conſider the Circumſtances above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and (as I ſaid before) try if they can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Exiſtence and motion of a Vapour. Sir <hi>Tho. Dereham</hi> freely owns himſelf at a loſs to account for this; as well he might in ſuppoſing it a meer fired Vapour. Miſtaken Notions, by skilful Advocates, are often made to appear like Truth; but Truth itſelf, though defended by far meaner Parts, generally carries a ſtronger Conviction.</p>

                     <p>THE following Account of an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> I had from an intimate Friend, an Apothecary in <hi>London,</hi> ſince the foregoing Diſſertation on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0377400900:230"/>was ſent to the Preſs: Its confirming in a great meaſure ſome things that I deliver'd as Conjectures on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, made me the more willing to inſert it.</p>
                     <p>Himſelf, in company with two other Perſons, ſaw one of theſe Appearances in a Garden about nine of the Clock in a dark Night: They at firſt imagin'd it ſome Country Fellow with a Lanthorn, till approaching within about ſix Yards, it ſuddenly diſappeared; and in a ſmall ſpace of time appear'd in a dry Field, about thirty of forty Yards off. It diſappear'd as ſuddenly a ſecond time, and was ſeen again near an hundred Yards off; from thence it removed to a further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo to a further; till at length they ſpied it in another Field, parted from the firſt by a thick Hedge, and ſo from Field to Field. Whether it went over, or through the Hedge, could not be obſerv'd, becauſe it paſſed from one Field to the other whilſt dark.</p>
                     <p>This Gentleman told me he had ſeen this Light di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times afterwards; it always appeared the ſame, without any diſcernable difference either in bigneſs or figure, and that ſeveral other Perſons had ſeen it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Once he ſaw this Appearance in a dry Field, fixed, without Motion; the ſame two Perſons being with him that ſaw it in the Garden the firſt time, agreed to try how near they could get to it; and having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd within ten or twelve Yards, one of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons was for running to catch it; which haſty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding made it immediately vaniſh: It appear'd again at little diſtances as before, but ſeem'd to pack away as it were in a Fright.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Obſervations were made at <hi>Aſtley,</hi> ſeven Miles from <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
