            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> from whom I met with every politeneſs. I then commenced with him a friendſhip which ever ſince has given me ſingular pleaſure. I found Father <hi>Falkener</hi> to be a man of about ſeventy Years of age, active in mind and body, <hi>Bruſque</hi> in his manners, having never ſhaken off thoſe he had acquired in his thirty eight Years reſidence among the Savages. He very freely communicated to me every thing he knew reſpecting thoſe People. He informed me alſo that he was born at <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> that about the Year 1731 he was a Surgeon in the <hi>Aſſiento</hi> Ship, and in that Year became at <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> a convert to Popery; and in due time of the ſociety of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and was ſent on the miſſion of <hi>Paraquay.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I NOW execute the promiſe I made in Town ſome time ago, of communicating to you the reſult of my viſit to Mr. <hi>Falkener</hi> an antient Jeſuit who had paſſed thirty eight Years of his life in the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of South <hi>America</hi> between the River <hi>la Plata</hi> and the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan.</hi> Let me endeavour to prejudice you in favor of my new Friend, by aſſuring you, that by his long intercourſe with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> he ſeems to have loſt all <hi>European</hi> guile, and to have acquired all the ſimplicity and honeſt impetuoſity of the people he has been ſo long converſant with. I venture to give you only as much of his narrative as he could vouch for the authenticity of; which conſiſts of ſuch as he was eye witneſs to, and ſuch as will (I believe) eſtabliſh paſt contradiction the veracity of our late Circumnavigators and give new lights into the manners of this ſingular race of Men: It will not I flatter myſelf be deemed impertinent to lay before you a Chronological Mention of the ſeveral evidences that will tend to prove the exiſtence of a People of a ſupernatural height inhabiting the Southern Tract. You will find, that the majority of Voyagers who have touched on that Coaſt have ſeen them, and made reports of their ſize that will very well keep in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the verbal account given by Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and the printed by Mr. <hi>Clarke;</hi> you will obſerve, that if the old Voyagers did exaggerate, it was thro' the novelty and amazement at ſo ſingular a ſight; but the latter forewarn'd by the preceding accounts, ſeem to have made their remarks with coolneſs, and confirmed them by the experiment of meaſurement.</p>

The firſt approached him, ſinging, and flinging the Duſt over his head; and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſigns of a mild and peaceable diſpoſition; his viſage was painted, his Garment the ſkin of ſome Animal neatly ſewed, his Arms a ſtout and thick Bow; a quiver of long Arrows feathered at one end and armed at the other with Flint. The height of theſe People was about ſeven Feet <hi>(French)</hi> but they were not ſo tall as the Perſon who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached them firſt, who is repreſented to have been of ſo Gigantic a ſize, that <hi>Magellan's</hi> Men did not with their Heads reach as high as the waiſt of this <hi>Patagonian.</hi> They had with them Beaſts of Burden on which they placed their Wives; by <hi>Magellan's</hi> deſcription of them, they appear to have been the Animals now known by the Name of <hi>Llama.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Interviews ended with the captivating two of the People who were carry'd away in two different Ships, but as ſoon as they arrived in the hot Climate each of them died</p>
            <p>I dwell the longer on this account, as it appears extremely deſerving of credit; as the courage of <hi>Magellan</hi> made him incapable of giving an exaggerated account through the influence of fear: nor could there be any miſtake about the height; as he had not only a long intercourſe with them, but the actual poſſeſſion of two, for a very conſiderable ſpace of time.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Ram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tranſactions for 1767 p. 75. Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> was Officer in Mr. <hi>Byrons</hi> ſhip, landed with him in the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and had for two hours an opportunity of ſtanding within a few yards of this race, and ſeeing them examined and meaſured by Mr. <hi>Byron.</hi> He repreſents them in general as ſtout and well proportion'd, and aſſures us, that none of the Men were lower than eight feet, and that ſome even exceeded nine; and that the Women were from ſeven feet and an half to eight feet, he law Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> meaſure one of the Men, and notwithſtanding the Commodore was near ſix feet high, he could when on tip toe, but juſt reach with his hand the top of the <hi>Patagonian's</hi> head; and Mr, <hi>Clarke</hi> is certain, that there were ſeveral taller than him on whom the experiment was made, for there was about five hundred Men Women and Children. They ſeem'd very happy at the landing of our people, and expreſſed their joy by a rude ſort of ſinging. They were of a copper color, and had long lank hair, and faces hideouſly painted; both ſexes were cover'd with ſkins, and ſome appeared on horſeback and others on foot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Premontel</hi> makes this an object of ridicule, as if the ſize of the horſes were unequal to the burden of the riders. Our Navigators tell us, that the horſes were fifteen or ſixteen feet high. It is well known, that a Mill-horſe has been known to carry nine hundred and ten pounds, a weight probably beyond that of any <hi>Patagonian</hi> they ſaw.</p>
            <p>A few had on their legs a ſort of boot with a ſharp pointed ſtick at the heel inſtead of a ſpur. Their bridles were made of thong, the bit wood; the ſaddle as artleſs as poſſible, and without ſtirrups. The intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of horſes into theſe parts by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> introduced likewiſe the only ſpecies of manufacture they appear to be acquainted with. All their ſkill ſeems to extend no further than theſe rude eſſays at a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to equip themſelves for <hi>Cavaliers.</hi> In other reſpects they would be in the ſame ſtate as our firſt parents juſt turned out of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, cloathed in coats of ſkins; or at beſt in the ſame condition in which <hi>Caeſar</hi> found the ancient <hi>Britons;</hi> for their dreſs was ſimilar, their hair long, and their bodies like thoſe of our Anceſtors made terrific by wild painting. Theſe people by ſome means or other had acquired a few beads and bracelets; otherwiſe not a ſingle article of <hi>European</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0175800600:8"/>
fabric appeared among them. Theſe they muſt have gotten by the intercourſe with the other <hi>Indian</hi> tribes: for had they had any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they never would have neglected procuring knives, the ſtirrups, and other conveniences which the people ſeen by Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> had.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have been glad to have cloſed in this place theſe relations of this ſtupendous race of Mankind; becauſe the two following accounts given by gentlemen of character and abilities ſeem to contradict great part of what had been before advanced, or at left ſerve to give ſcoffers room to ſay, that the preceding Navigators had ſeen theſe people thro' the medium of magnifying glaſſes inſtead of the ſober eye of obſervation: but before I make my remarks on what has been before related, I ſhall proceed with the other Navigators, and then attempt to reconcile the different accounts. In 1767 Captain <hi>Wallis</hi> of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and Captain <hi>Philip Carteret</hi> of the <hi>Swallow</hi> Sloop ſaw and meaſured with a pole ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Patagonians</hi> who happen'd to be in the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan</hi> during his paſſage,<note n="*" place="bottom">

That their arms were ſlings formed of two round balls, faſten'd one to each end of a cord, which they fling with great force and dexterity, He adds they hold one ball in their hand and ſwing the other at the full length of the cord round their head by which it acquires a prodigious velocity: they will fling it to a great diſtance, and with ſuch exactneſs, as to ſtrike a very ſmall object; theſe people were alſo mounted on Horſes, their faddles bridles &amp;c. were of their own making; ſome had iron and others metal bits to their bridles, and one had a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> broad ſword; but whether the laſt articles were taken by war or procured by commerce is uncertain, but the laſt is moſt probable. It ſeems evident that they had intercourſe with <hi>Europeans,</hi> and had even adopted ſome of their faſhions, for many had cut their dreſs into form of <hi>Spaniſh Punches,</hi> or a ſquare piece of cloth with a hole cut for the head, the reſt hanging

looſe as low as the knees. They alſo wore drawers, ſo theſe people had attained a few ſteps farther towards civilization than their gigantic neighbors, others again will appear to have made a far greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, for theſe ſtill devour'd their meat raw and drank nothing but water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Bougainville</hi> in the ſame year ſaw another party of the natives of <hi>Patagonia:</hi> he meaſured ſeveral of them, and declares that none were lower than five feet five inches, <hi>French,</hi> or taller than five feet ten, i. e. five feet ten or ſix feet three <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure, he concludes his account with ſaying, that he afterwards met with a taller people in the S. ſea, but I do not recollect that he mentions the place.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to be obliged to remark in theſe voyages a very illibral propenſity to cavil at, and invalidate the account given by Mr. <hi>Byron:</hi> but at the ſame time exult in having an opportunity given me by that Gentleman of vindicating his and the national honor. <hi>M. Bougainville</hi> in order to prove he fell in with the identical people that Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with, aſſerts, that he ſaw numbers of them poſſeſſed of knives of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> manufactory, certainly given them by Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> but he ſhould have conſidered that there are more ways than one of coming at a thing, that the commerce between <hi>Sheffield</hi> and <hi>South America</hi> through the port of <hi>Cadiz</hi> is moſt uncommonly large; and that his <hi>Indians</hi> might have got their knives from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the ſame time that they got their gilt nails and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> harneſs: but for farther ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this ſubject, I have liberty to ſay from Mr. <hi>Byron's</hi> authority, that he never gave a ſingle knife to the people he ſaw, that he had not one at that time about him, that excepting the preſents given with his own hands, and the tobacco brought by Lieutenant <hi>Cummins,</hi> not the leaſt trifle was beſtowed. I am furniſhed with one other proof, that theſe leſſer <hi>Indians</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> ſaw were not the ſame with thoſe deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> as has been inſinuated: for the firſt had with him ſome officers who had been with him on the preceding Voyage, and who bear witneſs not only to the difference of ſize, but declare that theſe people had not a ſingle article among them given by Mr. <hi>Byron</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Byrons</hi> letter at the end.</note>. It is extremely probable that theſe were the <hi>Indians</hi> that Mr.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0175800600:10"/>
               <hi>Bougainville</hi> fell in with, for they were furniſhed with bits, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſcymeter and braſs ſtirrups as before mentioned.</p>
            <p>My laſt evidence of theſe gigantic <hi>Americans</hi> is that which I received from Mr. <hi>Falkener;</hi> he acquainted me that about the year 1742 he was ſent on a miſſon to the vaſt plains of <hi>Pampas,</hi> which if I recollect right lies to the S. W. of <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> and extends near a thouſand miles towards the <hi>Andes.</hi> In theſe plains he firſt met with ſome tribes of theſe people and was taken under the protection of one of the <hi>Caciques.</hi> The remarks he made on their ſize were as follows; that the talleſt which he meaſured in the ſame manner that Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> did, was ſeven feet eight inches high, that the common height or middle ſize was ſix feet, that there were numbers that were even ſhorter, and that the tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Women did not exceed ſix feet. That they were ſcattered from the foot of the <hi>Andes,</hi> over that vaſt tract which extends to the <hi>Atlantic Ocean</hi> and are found as far as the <hi>red river</hi> at Bay <hi>Anagada</hi> lat. 40. 1; below that the land is too barren to be habitable and none are found except accidental migrants till you arrive at the river <hi>Gallego</hi> near the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are ſuppoſed to be a race derived from the <hi>Chilian Indians,</hi> the <hi>Puelches</hi> who inhabited the eaſtern ſide of the <hi>Andes,</hi> the ſame brave nation who defeated and deſtroyed the avaritious <hi>Spaniard Baldivia</hi> but after that were diſpoſſeſs'd of their ſeat.</p>
            <p>They dwell in large tents covered with the hides of Mares and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided within into Apartments for the different ranks of the Family, by a ſort of blanketting. They are a moſt migratory people and often ſhift their quarters; when the Women ſtrike the tents aſſiſt in putting them on their horſes and like the females of all ſavage countries under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all the laborious work.</p>
            <p>They have two motives for ſhifting their quarters, one for the ſake of getting ſalt which they find incruſted in the ſhallow pools near the ſea ſide.</p>
            <p>The other inducement is the ſuperſtition they have of burying their dead within a certain diſtance of the ocean, and I may certainly add a third, that of the neceſſity they muſt lie under of ſeeking freſh quarters on account of the chace which is their principal ſubſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0175800600:11"/>Thoſe who deny the exiſtence of theſe great People never conſider the migratory nature of the Inhabitants of this prodigious tract, and never reflect that the tribes who may have been ſeen this month on the coaſt, may the next be ſome hundreds of miles inland and their place occupied by a tribe or nation totally different. Theſe Gentlemen ſeem to lay down as a certain poſition, that <hi>Patagonia</hi> is peopled by only a ſingle nation, and from that falſe principle they draw their arguments, ſneer inſult and even groſsly abuſe all that differ in opinion. Among the moſt illiberal of theſe writers is <hi>M. de Premontel,</hi> who with the rapid inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of his country mounts on his head ſtrong courſer PREJUDICE, ſets off full ſpeed, rides over all the honeſt fellows that would inform him of his road, and ſpurns even truth herſelf tho' ſhe offers to be his guide: but truth is unadorned and hated by this fantaſtic writer, would ſpoil him of all the flowers of fiction, and tropes of abuſe againſt a rival country, would teach him facts that would ruin his argument and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his eloquent memoire to a ſingle narrative of unconteſted veracity.</p>
            <p>Their food is (almoſt entirely) animal: the fleſh of Horſes, Oxen, Guanacoes and Oſtriches, all of which they eat roaſted or boiled. Their drink is water except in the ſeaſon when certain ſpecies of Fruit are ripe, for of thoſe they make a ſort of fermenting Liquor called <hi>Chucha</hi> common to many parts of South America. One kind is made of a podd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fruit called <hi>Algarrova</hi> which ſmells like a bug, and when bruiſed in Water becomes an inebriating Liquor. The ſame fruit is alſo eaten as bread. The other <hi>Chucha</hi> is made of the <hi>Molic</hi> a ſmall fruit, hot and ſweet in the Mouth, both theſe cauſe a deep drunkenneſs, eſpecially the laſt which excites a phrenetic inebriation and a wildneſs of Eyes, which laſts, two or three Days.</p>
            <p>The Cloathing of theſe People is either a mantle of Skins or of a Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Puelches</hi> have no Sheep but what they purchaſe from the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in their Dances. Their Hair is long and tied up with a fillet. They have naturally Beards,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>M. Premontel</hi> roundly aſſerts that they have no beards.</note> but they generally pluck up the Hairs; not but ſome leave Muſtaches, as was obſerv'd by Mr. <hi>Carteret</hi> and <hi>M. Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they go to War they wear a fourfold Coat of the Skin of the <hi>Tapier,</hi> a Cap of Bull's hide doubled, and a broad Target of the ſame. Their offenſive Weapons are Bows and Arrows, the laſt headed with bone, launces headed with Iron and broad ſwords, both which they procure from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but their native Weapons are Slings, of theſe they have two kinds, one for War which conſiſts of a thong, headed with Stone, at only one end; and during their Campaigns they carry numbers of theſe wraped about their bodies.</p>
            <p>The Slings which they uſe in the chace of Horſes, Cattle or Oſtriches have a Stone fixed to each end; and ſometimes another thong with a third Stone is faſten'd to the middle of the other: theſe with amazing dexterity, they fling round the objects of the chace be they Beaſts or Oſtriches which entangle them ſo that they cannot ſtir. The Indians leave them I may ſay thus tied neck and heels, and go on in purſuit of freſh Game; and having finiſh'd their ſport return to pick up the Animals they left ſecur'd in the ſlings.</p>
            <p>Their Wars are chiefly with the other <hi>Indians,</hi> for <hi>Patagonia</hi> is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by variety of People, not a ſingle nation. They have a great deal of intercourſe with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and often come down to <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi>
to trade for Iron, Bugles &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This commerce with the <hi>Europeans</hi> has corrupted them greatly, taught them the vice of dram-drinking and been a dreadful obſtacle to their moral improvement. Mr. <hi>Falkener</hi> inform'd me, that he once prevaled on about five hundred to form a reduction, but that they grew unruly and ungovernable as ſoon as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Traders got among them.</p>
            <p>Their War and their chace are carried on Horſeback, for they are moſt expert riders and have multitudes of Horſes with which the Country is perfectly over-run for they go in herds of thouſands.

            </p>
            <p>They have Prieſts and Prieſteſſes, whoſe office is to mediate with theſe Beings in caſe of ſickneſs or any diſtreſs; by the intervention of the Prieſt they are conſulted about future events; at thoſe ſeaſons the Prieſt ſhuts himſelf up and falls into a phrenetic extacy <note n="§" place="bottom">The pretenders to ſecond ſight in the <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If a <hi>Cazique</hi> dies or any public calamity happens; for example in particular when the ſmall pox had made great ravages among the Tribes, the Prieſts are ſure to ſuffer, for the misfortune is preſumed to have happened thro' their neglect in not deprecating the evil, in theſe caſes they have no other method of ſaving themſelves, but by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blame on others of their Brethren.</p>
            <p>Prieſts are choſen from among the young People the moſt effeminate they can find, but thoſe that are epileptic have always the preference, and theſe dreſs in a female habit.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0175800600:14"/>The <hi>Puelches</hi> have a notion of a future ſtate, and imagine that after death they are to be tranſported to a Country, where the fruits of inebriation are eternal, there to live in immortal drunkenneſs, and the perpetual chace of the Oſtrich.</p>
            <p>When a Perſon of eminence dies, the moſt reſpectable Women in the place goes into the Tent, clears the Body of all the inteſtines, and ſcrapes off as much of the fleſh from the bones as poſſible, and then burns very carefully both that and the entrails; when that is done, the bones are buried till the reſt of the fleſh is quite decay'd: they are taken up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year; and if any of the bones drop out of their places they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed and tied together, and the whole form'd into a perfect ſkeleton. Thus complete, it is packed up in a hide, put on the back of a favorite Horſe of the deceaſed, and then tranſlated to the Tomb of his Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, perhaps 300 miles diſtant and always within a ſmall ſpace from the Sea.</p>
            <p>The ſkeleton is then taken out and deck'd in its beſt Robes, and adorn'd with plumes and beads, is placed ſiting in a deep ſquare pit parallel with thoſe buried before, with Sword Launce and other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons placed by them, and the ſkins of their Horſes ſtuff'd and ſupported by ſtakes alſo accompany them.

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0175800600:16"/>The third Claſs is compoſ'd of thoſe whoſe height is ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as to occaſion ſo great a diſbelief, of the accounts of Voyagers; and yet they are indiſputable an exiſtent People, they have been ſeen by <hi>Magellan</hi> and ſix other in the 16th. Century and by two if not three in the preſent.</p>
            <p>The fourth Claſs is a mixed race, who careleſs about preſerving their generous and exalted breed pure and undegenerate, have degraded themſelves by intermixing with the puny tribes of the country, and from that intercourſe have produced a mongrel breed of every ſize, except that of the original ſtandard, ſome few, as if by accident, ſeem to aſpire to the height of their anceſtors, but are checked in their growth, and ſtop at the ſtature of ſeven feet eight inches, ſcarce the middle ſize of the genuine breed. But another reaſon maybe aſſigned for the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and inequality of ſize in this Claſs: they live within the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Europeans,</hi> they have intercourſe with them, and from them they have acquired the vice of dram drinking and all its horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; this alone is ſufficient to make a nation of giants dwindle into pygmies.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon may ſtill be aſſigned <hi>viz.</hi> The introduction of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies among them. Thoſe people who depended on the ſpoils of the chaſe for their habiliments were certain of preſerving their full vigor, their ſtrength of conſtitution and fullneſs of habit, while thoſe who are confin'd to the loom grow enervate and loſe much of the force of their bodily faculties. They alſo live in tents lin'd with woollen manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, which doubtleſsly are much more delicate, luxurious and warm than the dwellings of the third undegenerate Claſs. We are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the form of their tents, but we know that they ſtill cloath themſelves with the ſkins of beaſts, and that among thoſe, Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> ſaw there was not the leſt appearance of manufactury excepting what related to their horſe furniture. Theſe ſeem to have been the genuine remains of the free race, the conquerors of <hi>Pedro de Baldivia,</hi> the <hi>Puelches</hi> whoſe original ſtation was among the <hi>Andes</hi> of <hi>Chiloe</hi> in about <hi>Latitude</hi> 43 and almoſt due eaſt of the iſle of <hi>Chiloe.</hi> Theſe were the deſcendents of the <hi>Indians</hi> who retreated to the ſouth far out of the common track of <hi>Europeans</hi> and who retain their primaval grandeur of ſize; the others
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0175800600:17"/>
who fled northeaſt forgetful of their orignal magnificent ſtature, loſt in general that noble diſtinction by unſuitable alliances and the uſe of ſpirits, while the firſt probably only marry among themſelves and certainly have all ſtrong liquor in abhorrence; ſome of this tall race ſeem ſtill to inhabit the ſtations of their Anceſtors or ſome not very remote from them; for <hi>M. Frezier</hi> was aſſur'd by <hi>Don Pedro Molina</hi> Govenor of <hi>Chiloe</hi> that he once was viſited by ſome of theſe People, who were four <hi>varas</hi> or about nine or ten feet high; they came in company with ſome <hi>Chiloe Indians</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Frezier's</hi> Voyage p. 86.</note> with whom they were friends and who probably found them in ſome of their excurſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Premontal</hi> inſults <hi>M. Frezier</hi> with much acrimony on account of this relation; and charges him with changing the ſeat of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the eaſtern coaſt to the weſtern or the tract between <hi>Chiloe</hi> and the <hi>Magellanic</hi> ſtreights, but the truth is, that <hi>Frezier</hi> ſays no ſuch thing, but mentions them as a nation living up the country inland not near the ſhores; <hi>M. Premontal</hi> alſo ſneers at the evidence of the crews of the <hi>Maloe</hi> ſhips; but they by no means place theſe tall People on the weſtern coaſt of <hi>S. America,</hi> but at <hi>Gregory Bay</hi> a place very little diſtant from the eaſtern entrance of the <hi>Streights</hi> and near which theſe giants have been more frequently ſeen than any where elſe.</p>
            <p>My remarks on <hi>M. de Premontal</hi> are but a tribute to the many civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have received from doctor <hi>Matie</hi> who has been moſt unprovokedly unjuſtly and illiberally abuſed by this vague and pragmatical writer.</p>
            <p>Thus I conclude all that I collect relating to theſe ſingular People. Let me beg you to receive the account with your uſual Candor and think me with the moſt regard</p>

            <head>Copy of a Paper tranſmitted from Admiral <hi>Byron</hi> to me; through the hands of the Right Reverend <hi>John Egerton</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> after he had peruſed the Manuſcript of the foregoing account.</head>
            <q>
               <p>The People I ſaw upon the coaſt of <hi>Patagonia</hi> were not the ſame that was ſeen the ſecond Voyage. One or two of the Officers that ſail'd with me and afterwards with Captain <hi>Wallace</hi> declar'd to me that they had not a ſingle thing I had diſtributed amongſt thoſe I ſaw. <hi>M. Bougainville</hi> remarks that his officers landed amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> I had ſeen, as they had many <hi>Engliſh</hi> knives amongſt them which were, as he pretends, undoubtedly given by me: now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that I never gave a ſingle knife to any of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> nor did I even carry one a ſhore with me.</p>
               <p>I had often heard from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that there were two or three different nations of very tall People, the largeſt of which inhabit thoſe immenſe plains at the back of the <hi>Andes.</hi> The others ſome where near the river <hi>Galiegos.</hi> I take it to be the former that I ſaw, and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, returning from <hi>Port Famine</hi> where I had been to wood and water I ſaw thoſe Peoples fires a long way to the weſtward of where I had left them and a great way inland, ſo as the winter was approaching they were certainly returning to a better climate. I remarked that they had not one ſingle thing amongſt them that ſhewed they ever had any commerce with <hi>Europeans.</hi> They were certainly of a moſt amazing ſize: ſo much were their horſes diſproportion'd that all the People that were with me in the boats when very near the ſhore ſwore that they were all mounted upon deer; and to this inſtant I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is not a man that landed with me, tho' they were at ſome diſtance from them, but would ſwear they took them to be nine feet high. I do ſuppoſe many of them were between ſeven and eight and ſtrong in proportion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> is much obliged to Mr. <hi>Pennant</hi> for the peruſal of his Manuſcript and thinks his remarks very judicious.</p>
