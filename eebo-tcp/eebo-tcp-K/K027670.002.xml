            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>I Will not ſend your ladyſhip the trifles you bid me purchaſe without a line.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0192301202:4"/>
therefore I was not to pay for the horſe—but I might as well have whiſtled, as have ſpoke French, and I believe my Latin was equal to my uncle Toby's Lilabulero—being not underſtood becauſe of it's purity, but by dint of words I forced my judge to do me juſtice—no common thing by the way in France.—My wife and daughter are arrived—the latter does nothing but look out of the window, and complain of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of being frizled.—I wiſh ſhe may ever remain a child of nature—I hate children of art.</p>

               <p>MY wife and daughter arrived here ſafe and ſound on Thurſday, and are in high raptures with the ſpeed and pleaſantneſs of their journey, and particularly of all they ſee and meet with here. But in their journey from York to Paris, nothing has given them a more ſenſible and laſting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than the marks of kindneſs they received from you and Mrs. E.—The friendſhip, good will and politeneſs

of my two friends I never doubted to me, or mine, and I return you both all a grateful man is capable of, which is merely my thanks. I have taken however the liberty of ſending an Indian taffety, which Mrs. E. muſt do me the honour to wear for my wife's ſake, who would have got it made up, but that Mr. Stanhope, the Conſul of Algiers, who ſets off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow morning for London, has been ſo kind (I mean his lady) as to take charge of it; and we had but juſt time to procure it: and had we miſs'd that opportunity, as we ſhould have been obliged to have left it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us at Paris, we knew not when or how to get it to our friend.—I

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0192301202:10"/>
old eaſy fool and has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the moſt artful of her ſex, and ſhe muſt have abundance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and charlatanery to have carried on ſuch a farce. I pity the old man for being taken in for ſo much money—a man of ſenſe I ſhould have laughed at—My wife ſaw her when in town, and ſhe had not the appearance of poverty, but when ſhe wants to melt **** heart ſhe puts her gold watch and diamond rings in her drawer.—But he might have been aware of her. I could not have been miſtaken in her character—and 'tis odd ſhe ſhould talk of her wealth to one, and tell another the reverſe—ſo good night to her.—About a week
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0192301202:11"/>
or ten days before my wife arrived at Paris I had the ſame accident I had at Cambridge, of breaking a veſſel in my lungs. It happen'd in the night, and I bled the bed full, and finding in the morning I was likely to bleed to death, I ſent immediately for a ſurgeon to bleed me at both arms—this ſaved me, and with lying ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs three days I recovered upon my back in bed; the breach healed, and in a week after I got out—This with my weakneſs and hurrying about made me think it high time to haſte to Toulouſe.—We have had four months of ſuch heats that the oldeſt Frenchman never remembers the like—'twas as hot as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0192301202:12"/>
                  <hi>oven,</hi> and never has relaxed one hour—in the height of this 'twas our deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny (or rather deſtruction) to ſet out by way of Lyons, Montpellier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſhorten, I trow, our ſufferings—Good God!—but tis over—and here I am in my own houſe, quite ſettled by M....'s aid, and good-natured offices, for which I owe him more than I can expreſs or know how to pay at preſent—'Tis in the prettieſt ſituation in Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe, with near two acres of garden—the houſe too good by half for us—well furniſhed, for which I pay thirty pounds a year.—I have got a good cook—my wife a decent <hi>femme de chambre,</hi> and a good looking <hi>laquais</hi>—The Abbé has planned our expences,

and ſet us in ſuch a train, we cannot eaſily go wrong—tho' by the bye the D— is ſeldom found ſleeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a hedge. Mr. Trotter dined with me the day before I left Paris—I took care to ſee all executed according to your directions—but Trotter, I dare ſay, by this has wrote to you—I made him happy beyond expreſſion with your crazy tales, and more ſo with its frontiſpiece.—I am in ſpirits, writing a crazy chapter—with my face turned towards thy turret—'Tis now I wiſh all warmer climates, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and every thing elſe at — that ſeparates me from our paternal ſeat—<hi>ce ſera là où repoſera ma cendre—et ce ſera là où mon couſin viendra repondre</hi>

               <p>AFTER many turnings (<hi>alias</hi> digreſſions) to ſay nothing of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right overthrows, ſtops, and delays, we have arrived in three weeks at Toulouſe, and are now ſettled in our houſes with ſervants, &amp;c. about us, and look as compoſed as if we had been here ſeven years.—In our journey we ſuffered ſo much from the heats, it gives me pain to remember
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0192301202:17"/>
it—I never ſaw a cloud from Paris to Niſmes half as broad as a twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four ſols piece.—Good God! we were toaſted, roaſted, grill'd, ſtew'd and carbonaded on one ſide or other all the way—and being all done enough <hi>(aſſez cuits)</hi> in the day, we were eat up at night by bugs, and other unſwept out vermin, the legal inhabitants (if length of poſſeſſion gives right) of every inn we lay at.—Can you conceive a worſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident than that in ſuch a journey, in the hotteſt day and hour of it, four miles from either tree or ſhrub which could caſt a ſhade of the ſize of one of Eve's fig leaves—that we ſhould break a hind wheel into
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0192301202:18"/>
ten thouſand pieces, and be obliged in conſequence to ſit five hours on a gravelly road, without one drop of water or poſſibility of getting any—To mend the matter, my two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillions were two dough-hearted fools, and fell a crying—Nothing was to be done! By heaven, quoth I, pulling off my coat and waiſtcoat, ſomething ſhall be done, for I'll thraſh you both within an inch of your lives—and then make you take each of you a horſe, and ride like two devils to the next poſt for a cart to carry my bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and a wheel to carry ourſelves—Our luggage weighed ten quintals—'twas the fair of Baucaire—all the world was going, or returning—we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0192301202:19"/>
were ask'd by every ſoul who paſs'd by us, if we were going to the fair of Baucaire—No wonder, quoth I, we have goods enough! <hi>vous avez raiſon mes amis</hi>—</p>
               <p>Well! here we are after all, my dear friend—and moſt deliciouſly placed at the extremity of the town, in an excellent houſe well furniſh'd, and elegant beyond any thing I look'd for—'Tis built in the form of a hotel, with a pretty court towards the town—and behind, the beſt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in Toulouſe, laid out in ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine walks, and ſo large that the company in our quarter uſually come to walk there in the evenings, for

which they have my conſent—<q rend="inline">"the more the merrier."</q>—The houſe conſiſts of a good <hi>ſalle à manger</hi> above ſtairs joining to the very great <hi>ſalle à com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnie</hi> as large as the Baron D'Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach's; three handſome bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with dreſſing rooms to them—below ſtairs two very good rooms for myſelf, one to ſtudy in, the other to ſee company.—I have moreover cellars round the court, and all other offices—Of the ſame landlord I have bargained to have the uſe of a country-houſe which he has two miles out of town, ſo that myſelf and all my family have nothing more to do than to take our hats and remove from the one to the other—My
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0192301202:21"/>
landlord is moreover to keep the gardens in order—and what do you think I am to pay for all this? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſs than thirty pounds a year—all things are cheap in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—ſo we ſhall live for very very little.—I dined yeſterday with Mr. H— he is moſt pleaſantly ſituated, and they are all well.—As for the books you have received for D—, the bookſeller was a fool not to ſend the bill along with them—I will write to him about it.—I wiſh you was with me for two months; it would cure you of all evils ghoſtly and bodily—but this, like many other wiſhes both for you and myſelf, muſt have its completion elſewhere—Adieu my

               </opener>
               <p>I Received your letter yeſterday—ſo it has been travelling from Crazy Caſtle to Toulouſe full eighteen days—If I had nothing to ſtop me I would engage to ſet out this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and knock at Crazy Caſtle gates in three days leſs time—by which time I ſhould find you and the colonel, Panty, &amp;c. all alone—the ſeaſon I moſt wiſh and like to be with you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0192301202:24"/>
—I rejoice from my heart, down to my reins, that you have ſnatch'd ſo many happy and ſunſhiny days out of the hands of the blue devils—If we live to meet and join our forces as heretofore we will give theſe gentry a drubbing—and turn them for ever out of their uſurped citadel—ſome legions of them have been put to flight already by your operations this laſt campaign—and I hope to have a hand in diſperſing the remainder the firſt time my dear couſin ſets up his banners again under the ſquare tower—But what art thou meditating with axes and hammers?—<q rend="inline">"<hi>I know thy pride and the naughtineſs of thy heart,</hi>"</q> and thou loveſt the ſweet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0192301202:25"/>
viſions of architraves, friezes and pediments with their tympanums, and thou haſt found out a pretence, <hi>à raiſon de cinq cent livres ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to be laid out in four years, &amp;c. &amp;c. (ſo as not to be felt, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways added by the D— as a bait) to juſtify thyſelf unto thyſelf—It may be very wiſe to do this—but 'tis wiſer to keep one's money in one's pocket, whilſt there are wars without and rumours of wars within.—St. — adviſes his diſciples to ſell both coat and waiſtcoat—and go rather without ſhirt or ſword, than leave no money in their ſcrip, to go to Jeruſalem with—Now thoſe <hi>quatre ans conſecutifs,</hi> my dear Anthony, are the moſt precious

'twill be one of the many works of thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance—But after all, if the Fates have decreed it, as you and I have ſome time ſuppoſed it on account of your generoſity, <q rend="inline">"<hi>that you are never to be a monied man,</hi>"</q> the decree will be fulfilled whether you adorn your caſtle and line it with cedar, and paint it within ſide and without ſide with vermilion, or not—<hi>et cela etant</hi> (having a bottle of Frontiniac and glaſs at my right hand) I drink, dear

Anthony, to thy health and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to the final accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all thy lunary and ſublunary projects.—For ſix weeks together, after I wrote my laſt letter to you, my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were many ſtories higher, for I was all that time, as I thought, jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying on to the other world—I fell ill of an epidemic vile fever which killed hundreds about me—The phyſicians here are the erranteſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latans in Europe, or the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all pretending fools—I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew what was left of me out of their hands, and recommended my affairs entirely to Dame Nature—She (dear goddeſs) has ſaved me in fifty different pinching bouts, and I begin to have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0192301202:28"/>
a kind of enthuſiaſm now in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and in my own, That one or two more eſcapes will make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall leave you all at laſt by tranſlation, and not by fair death. I am now ſtout and fooliſh again as a happy man can wiſh to be—and am buſy playing the fool with my uncle Toby, who I have got ſouſed over head and ears in love.—I have many hints and projects for other works; all will go on I truſt as I wiſh in this matter.—When I have reaped the benefit of this winter at Toulouſe—I cannot ſee I have any thing more to do with it, therefore after having gone with my wife and girl to Bagnieres, I ſhall return from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0192301202:29"/>
whence I came—Now my wife wants to ſtay another year to ſave money, and this oppoſition of wiſhes, tho' it will not be as ſour as lemon, yet 'twill not be as ſweet as ſugar candy.—I wiſh T— would lead Sir Charles to Toulouſe; 'tis as good as any town in the South of France—for my own part, 'tis not to my taſte—but I believe, the ground work of my <hi>ennui</hi> is more to the eternal plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the French characters—little variety, no originality in it at all—than to any other cauſe—for they are very civil—but civility itſelf, in that uniform, wearies and bodders one to death—If I do not mind, I ſhall grow moſt ſtupid and ſententious—
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0192301202:30"/>
Miſs Shandy is hard at it with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, dancing, and French ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the laſt of which ſhe does <hi>à marveille,</hi> and ſpeaks it with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent accent, conſidering ſhe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices within ſight of the Pyrenean Mountains.—If the ſnows will ſuffer me, I propoſe to ſpend two or three months at Barege, or Bagnieres, but my dear wife is againſt all ſchemes of additional expences—which wicked propenſity (tho' not of deſpotick power) yet I cannot ſuffer—tho' by the bye laudable enough—But ſhe may talk—I will do my own way, and ſhe will acquieſce without a word of debate on the ſubject.—Who can ſay ſo much in praiſe of his wife? Few
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0192301202:31"/>
I trow.—M— is out of town vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taging—ſo write to me, <hi>Monſieur Sterne gentilhomme Anglois</hi>—'twill find me.—We are as much out of the road of all intelligence here as at the Cape of Good Hope—ſo write a long nonſenſical letter like this, now and then to me—in which ſay nothing but what may be ſhewn, (tho' I love every paragraph and ſpirited ſtroke of your pen, others might not) for you muſt know a letter no ſooner arrives from England, but curioſity is upon her knees to know the contents.—Adieu dear H. believe me,</p>

going to leave a few poor ſheep here in the wilderneſs for fourteen days—and from pride and naughtineſs of heart to go ſee what is doing at Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough—ſtedfaſtly meaning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to lead a new life and ſtrengthen my faith.—Now ſome folks ſay there is much company there—and ſome fay not—and I believe there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other—but will be both, if the world will have but a month's patience or ſo.—No, my dear H...

               <p>I Have juſt had the honour of a letter from Miſs T—, full of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of your attention and kind ſervices to her; I will not believe theſe aroſe from the D. of A....'s letters, nor mine. Surely <hi>ſhe needed no</hi> recommendation—the trueſt and moſt honeſt compliment I can pay you, is to ſay they came from your own good heart, only you was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

to the object—for the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd in courſe—However let me caſt in my mite of thanks to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury which belongs to good natured actions. I have been with Lord G—y theſe three weeks at Scarborough—the pleaſures of which I found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more exalted than thoſe of Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieres laſt year—I am now returned to my Philoſophical Hut to finiſh Triſtram, which I calculate will be ready for the world about Chriſtmas, at which time I decamp from hence, and fix my head quarters at London for the winter—unleſs my cough puſhes me forwards to your Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis—or that I can perſuade ſome <hi>gros</hi> my Lord to take a trip to you—

               <p>I had this week a letter from Mrs. S— from Montauban, in which ſhe tells me ſhe has occaſion for fifty pounds immediately—Will you ſend an order to your correſpondent at Montauban to pay her ſo much caſh—and I will in three weeks ſend as much to Becket—But as her purſe is low, for God's ſake write directly.—Now you muſt do ſomething e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually eſſential—to rectify a miſtake in the mind of your correſpondent there, who it ſeems gave her a hint not long ago, <q rend="inline">"<hi>that ſhe was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi>

               <p>THE firſt time I have dipped my pen into the ink-horn for this week paſt is to write to you, and to thank you moſt ſincerely for your kind epiſtle—Will this be a ſufficient apology for my letting it be ten days upon my table without anſwering it—I truſt it will—I am ſure my own feelings tell me ſo, becauſe I felt it impoſſible to do any thing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious towards you.—It is not every
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0192301202:128"/>
hour, or day, or week of a man's life that is a fit ſeaſon for the duties of friendſhip—ſentiment is not always at hand—pride and folly, and what is called buſineſs, oftentimes keep it at a diſtance—and without ſentiment, what is friendſhip?—a name, a ſhadow!—But, to prevent a miſapplication of this, (though why ſhould I fear it from ſo kind and gentle a ſpirit as your's)—you muſt know, that by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of my curate, or his wife, or his maid, or ſome one within his gates, the parſonage-houſe at Sutton was burnt to the ground, with the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture that belonged to me, and a pretty good collection of books; the loſs three hundred and fifty pounds—
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0192301202:129"/>
The poor man with his wife took the wings of the next morning, and fled away—this has given me real vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſo much was my pity and eſteem for him, that as ſoon as I heard of this diſaſter, I ſent to deſire he would come and take up his abode with me till another habitation was ready to receive him—but he was gone—and, as I am told, through fear of my perſecution.—Heavens! how little did he know of me to ſuppoſe I was among the number of thoſe wretches that heap misfortune upon misfortune—and when the load is almoſt inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, ſtill to add to the weight! God, who reads my heart, knows it to be true—that I wiſh rather to ſhare,

than to encreaſe the burthen of the miſerable—to dry up, inſtead of add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſingle drop to the ſtream of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.—As for the dirty traſh of this world, I regard it not—the loſs of it does not coſt me a ſigh, for after all, I may ſay with the Spaniſh Captain, that I am as good a gentleman as the king, only not quite ſo rich.</p>
               <p>But to the point: Shall I expect you here this ſummer?—I much wiſh that you may make it convenient to gratify me in a viſit for a few weeks—I will give you a roaſt fowl for your dinner, and a clean table-cloth every day—and tell you a ſtory by way of deſert—in the heat of the day we will

               <p>YOUR letter, my Lydia, has made me both laugh and cry—Sorry am I that you are both ſo afflicted with the ague, and by all means I wiſh you both to fly from Tours, becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is ſituated between two ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, la Loire, and le Cher—which muſt occaſion fogs, and damp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome weather—therefore for the ſame reaſon go not to Bourges en

Breſſe—'tis as vile a place for agues.—I find myſelf infinitely better than I was—and hope to have added at leaſt ten years to my life by this journey to Italy—the climate is heavenly, and I find new principles of health in me, which I have been long a ſtranger to—but truſt me, my Lydia, I will find you out wherever you are, in May. Therefore I beg you to direct to me at Belloni's at Rome, that I may have ſome idea where you will be then.—The account you give me of Mrs. C— is truly amiable, I ſhall ever honour her—Mr. C. is a divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing companion—what he ſaid of your little French admirer was truly droll—the Marquis de — is an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0192301202:149"/>

not improving in ſtature, but in breadth.—We have a jolly carnival of it—nothing but operas—punchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellos—feſtinos and maſquerades—We (that is <hi>nous autres</hi>) are all dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out for one this night at the Princeſs Francavivalla, which is to be ſuperb.—The Engliſh dine with her (excluſive) and ſo much for ſmall chat—except that I ſaw a little come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy acted laſt week with more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſpirit, and true character than I ſhall ſee one haſtily again.—I ſtay here till the holy week, which I ſhall paſs at Rome, where I occupy myſelf a month—My plan was to have gone from thence for a fortnight to Florence—and then by Leghorn to

Marſeilles directly home—but am di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from this by the repeated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of accompanying a gentleman, who is returning by Venice, Vienna, Saxony, Berlin, and ſo by the Spaw, and thence through Holland to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land—'tis with Mr. E...... I have known him theſe three years, and have been with him ever ſince I reach'd Rome; and as I know him to be a good hearted young gentleman, I have no doubt of making it anſwer both his views and mine—at leaſt I am perſuaded we ſhall return home together, as we ſet out, with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and good will.—Write your next letter to me at Rome, and do me the following favour if it lies in your way,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0192301202:156"/>
which I think it does—to get me a letter of recommendation to our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (Lord Stormont at Vienna) I have not the honour to be known to his lordſhip, but Lords P— or H—, or twenty you better know, would write a certificate for me, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that I am not fallen out of the clouds. If this will coſt my couſin little trouble, do incloſe it in your next letter to me at Belloni.—You have left Skelton I trow a month, and I fear have had a moſt ſharp win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if one may judge of it from the ſeverity of the weather here, and all over Italy, which exceeded any thing known till within theſe three weeks here, that the ſun has been as hot as

               <p>I Juſt received yours—and am glad that the balance of accounts is now paid to you—Thus far all goes well—I have received a letter from my daughter with the pleaſing tidings that ſhe thinks her mother out of danger—and that the air of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is delightful (excepting the winds) but the deſcription of the Chateau my wife has hired is really pretty—

Have you got the ninth volume of Shandy?—'tis liked the beſt of all here.—I am going to publiſh a Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

               <p>AND ſo, my Lydia! thy mother and thyſelf are returning back again from Marſeilles to the banks of the Sorgue—and there thou wilt ſit and fiſh for trouts—I envy you the ſweet ſituation.—Petrarch's tomb I ſhould like to pay a ſentimental viſit to—the Fountain of Vaucluſe, by thy deſcription, muſt be delightful—I

am alſo much pleaſed with the account you give me of the Abbé de Sade—you find great comfort in ſuch a neighbour—I am glad he is ſo good as to correct thy tranſlation of my Sermons—dear girl go on, and make me a preſent of thy work—but why not the Houſe of Mourning? 'tis one of the beſt. I long to receive the life of Petrarch, and his Laura, by your Abbé, but I am out of all patience with the anſwer the Marquis made the Abbé—'twas truly coarſe, and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he bore it with any chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience—But to the ſubject of your letter—I do not wiſh to know who was the buſy fool, who made your mother uneaſy about Mrs. —
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0192301202:183"/>
'tis true I have a friendſhip for her, but not to infatuation—I believe I have judgment enough to diſcern hers, and every woman's faults. I honour thy mother for her anſwer—<q rend="inline">"that ſhe wiſhed not to be informed, and begged him to drop the ſubject."</q>—Why do you ſay that your mother wants money?—whilſt I have a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhall you not both have nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence out of it?—I think, if I have my enjoyments, I ought not to grudge you yours.—I ſhall not begin my Sentimental Journey till I get to Coxwould—I have laid a plan for ſomething new, quite out of the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en track.—I wiſh I had you with me—and I would introduce you to one

of the moſt amiable and gentleſt of beings, whom I have juſt been with—not Mrs. —, but a Mrs. J. the wife of as worthy a man as I ever met with—I eſteem them both. He poſſeſſes every manly virtue—honour and bravery are his characteriſticks, which have diſtinguiſhed him nobly in ſeveral inſtances—I ſhall make you better acquainted with his character, by ſending Orme's Hiſtory, with the books you deſired—and it is well worth your reading; for Orme is an elegant writer, and a juſt one; he pays no man a compliment at the expence of truth.—Mrs. J— is kind—and friendly—of a ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal turn of mind—and ſo ſweet a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0192301202:185"/>
that ſhe is too good for the world ſhe lives in—Juſt God! if all were like her, what a life would this be!—Heaven, my Lydia, for ſome wiſe purpoſe has created dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent beings—I wiſh my dear child knew her—thou art worthy of her friendſhip, and ſhe already loves thee; for I ſometimes tell her what I feel for thee.—This is a long letter—write ſoon, and never let your letters be ſtudied ones—write naturally, and then you will write well.—I hope your mother has got quite well of her ague—I have ſent her ſome of Huxham's tincture of the Bark. I will order you a guittar ſince the other is broke.

               <p>But there is more goes to the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a wound than this comes to:—a wound (unleſs 'tis a wound not worth talking of, but by the bye mine is) muſt give you ſome pain after.—Nature will take her own way with it—it muſt ferment—it muſt digeſt.</p>

               <p>This vile ſtory, I ſay—tho' I then ſaw both how, and where it wounded—I felt little from it at firſt—or, to ſpeak more honeſtly (tho' it ruins my ſimile) I felt a great deal of pain from it, but affected an air uſual on ſuch accidents, of leſs feeling than I had.</p>
               <p>I have now got home to my lodgings ſince the play (you aſtoniſhed me in it) and have been unwrapping this ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame wound of mine, and ſhaking my head over it this half hour.</p>

               <p>Malice is ingenious—unleſs where the exceſs of it outwits itſelf—I have two comforts in this ſtroke of it;—the firſt is, that this one is partly of this kind; and ſecondly, that it is one of the number of thoſe which ſo unfairly brought poor Yorick to his grave.—The report might draw blood of the author of Triſtram Shandy—but could not harm ſuch a man as the author of the Divine Legation—God bleſs him! though (by the bye, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the natural courſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents) the bleſſing ſhould come from him to me.</p>
