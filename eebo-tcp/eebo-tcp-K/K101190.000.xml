            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On behalf of the court it was then declared that <q>the army was not deſigned to be made a part of our conſtitution, but to be kept only for a little time, till the circumſtances of Europe would better permit us to be without them.</q> 
                  <q>To which it was anſwered, and reaſons given to prove, that</q>

            <p>THE eſtabliſhment of ſtanding armies is, perhaps, the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of all political expedients, and has been fatal to the liberty of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon earth that has adopted it; and, therefore, though the doctrine of <hi>neceſſity</hi> is generally pleaded to excuſe the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0481800300:33"/>
yet there ſeems rather a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of abſolutely rejecting it; and of forming the national defence upon ſome other leſs dangerous plan.</p>
            <p>The ſervice of a <hi>national militia</hi> may be divided into equal proportions of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, <hi>by rotation,</hi> ſo as to inculcate and diffuſe a ſufficient knowledge of arms and military diſcipline throughout the whole body of a nation or people; and thereby ſuperſede the baneful <hi>neceſſity</hi> of keeping <hi>regular troops, or ſtanding armies of mercenaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever the public ſafety demands the aſſembling and continuance of a large body of troops in actual ſervice, to watch and reſiſt the motions of any powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, a regular military <q>
                  <hi>Roſter of Service,</hi>
               </q> from the <hi>whole national mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> is the ſafeſt and beſt means of forming and continuing ſuch an army in the field; becauſe it would be, not only, the leaſt burthenſome to individuals, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0481800300:34"/>
alſo leſs dangerous to the community at large; for, if the regularity of <hi>rotation</hi> were duly obſerved, no man would be ſo long detained from his ordinary calling and occupation as to loſe his <hi>civil capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> and way of livelihood at home, nor be thereby unwarily drawn into a <hi>ſeparate intereſt</hi> from his fellow-citizens; which was unhappily the caſe of the Parliament's army in 1647; for, after having bravely defended the <hi>national liberty</hi> for ſome years, this very army became the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a moſt hateful national <hi>bondage,</hi> under a military tyrant!</p>
            <p>The nature of a Roſter is well deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by General Bland, in his Treatiſe of military Diſcipline, from p. 287 to 312. When a great army is formed by ſeveral nations in alliance, which ſend into the field, each of them, a different number of battalions, a <hi>Roſter</hi> is eſteemed the beſt expedient for regulating and dividing the general ſervice into due proportions
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0481800300:35"/>
amongſt them all: and General Bland has given, in p. 290 of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Treatiſe, the form of ſuch <q>
                  <hi>a Roſter general for the detaching of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions, according to that in Flanders, in</hi> 1708.</q> He has alſo given <q>
                  <hi>Tables of Proportion for detaching private men,</hi>
               </q> that is, for detaching them from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral battalions in the field, that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fatigue of the ſervice (eſpecially at ſieges) may be equally divided among them. And, nearly on the ſame plan, tables might be formed, for detaching the <hi>individuals of a national militia from the ſeveral pariſhes, or diſtricts, to which they belong, in due proportion to the number of males enrolled in each of them;</hi> whereby the hardſhip and inconveniences of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary duty for the common ſafety would be equally divided among the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, of courſe, the time of actual ſervice would be moſt profitably diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0481800300:36"/>
to each individual, whilſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of arms and diſcipline would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly <hi>circulated</hi> into all parts of the country; and with it alſo ſuch a ſenſible perception, to each individual, of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, or incorporation, with the whole national community, as would plainly tend to prevent all partial and undue emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of particular counties or diſtricts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their neighbours: for, by ſuch provincial jealouſies, the ancient ſtates of Greece were unhappily diſunited, and their attention withdrawn from that true mutual intereſt and defence of each other, without which none of them could long ſubſiſt in freedom: whereas, if (on the contrary) they had been inured to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial duty of ſerving in one common army, drawn equally from each confederate ſtate, by a proper <hi>"Table of Proportion,"</hi> and duly changed by <hi>rotation,</hi> (to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from becoming <hi>mere ſoldiers,</hi>) there would have been no juſt cauſe to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0481800300:37"/>
be jealous of each other's power (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Athenians and Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>); for all ſucceſſes, as well as loſſes, would have been equally divided among them; ſo that no particular ſtate could have acquired, by victory, any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable advantages, peculiar to itſelf, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the jealouſy of the reſt; but every individual, in every part, would, by theſe means, have been led to conſider himſelf, not merely as a member of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle petty ſtate or diſtrict, but (with a more enlarged idea of his own ſocial cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter) as a member, rather, of the whole community of free citizens throughout all Greece: for the circulation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>A <hi>Rotation,</hi> or general circulation of public duty, may be compared to thoſe <hi>"wheels within wheels,"</hi> which give life, vigour, and activity, to a <hi>whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> by enabling it (howſoever extenſive and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, with reſpect to local <hi>ſituation</hi>) to move and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert itſelf as <hi>one united living body,</hi> actuated by <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> like as the hoſts, or armies, of the commonwealth of Iſrael are typified by the Cherubim, or <hi>four</hi> living creatures, (as repreſented in the ſtandards of the four principal tribes,) united in <hi>one animated</hi> ſyſtem of action, moving altogether with wheels (or rotations) and wings, <hi>full of eyes</hi> within and without.</p>
                  <p>For, in a ſtate that is perfectly free, (and in ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) the eyes of the ſeveral individuals of which it is compoſed are permitted to look forward, with effect, to the true intereſts of the community at large; and may well be conſidered as the eyes, figuratively repreſented in the whole body of the Cherubim, and in all their parts; (their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels full of eyes round about;) every eye in that great united figurative body of the Cherubim help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>enlighten</hi> the <hi>intention,</hi> and thereby influence the motion or government of the whole.</p>
               </note> of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0481800300:38"/>
               <hi>Roſter</hi> would have been a moſt effectual bond of union to ſecure the connexion and communication of the moſt diſtant branches of the confederacy; and, by preſerving the general body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their <hi>civil capacity</hi> and <hi>ordinary occupations,</hi> it would alſo have rendered them leſs liable to be drawn from the common intereſt of the ſtate at large, partially to favour the arbitrary deſigns of any uſurping commander in chief or pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tyrant: for no general-officer (had ſuch a confederacy of national union been
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0481800300:39"/>
duly eſtabliſhed) would have been able to aſſume more power and authority, than what was fairly delegated by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of ſuffrages, in one <hi>great united general council</hi> of choſen citizens from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part.</p>
            <p>The general body of individuals, in ſuch a caſe, indeed, ſubmit themſelves to ſerve, by rotation, the humble ſtation of private ſoldiers; but the time of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice being limited, and <hi>equal</hi> to all men in duration, it would be no great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, eſpecially if each freeman that bears arms was allowed his <hi>natural right</hi> of ſuffrage in the ſtate, his due ſhare of legiſlative influence, to controul the commanders, and regulate the ſervice.</p>
            <p>In a nation conſiſting of ſix millions of ſouls, (which number England is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid to contain,) the number of males capable of bearing arms (and who, according to <hi>natural right,</hi> are juſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled alſo to a ſhare in the legiſlature)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0481800300:40"/>
would be eſtimated at a fourth part of that number, according to the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral mode of eſtimation, <hi>viz.</hi> 1,500,000 men; from which number a <hi>Roſter of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſervice from home,</hi> only for one month each man in the ſpace of a whole year, would ſupply a conſtant army in the field of 125,000 men, if ſo many were neceſſary. A continual change <hi>every month,</hi> or every <hi>fourteen days,</hi> of half a battalion at a time out of each diſtrict, or ſtill in ſmaller proportions, <hi>viz.</hi> a few companies at a time (or even by half-companies, from ſmaller diviſions or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes) would be moſt adviſeable, that every part of the country might always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nearly the proportion of eleven parts out of twelve of its own militia, as well for the purpoſes of guarding it, as to carry on the ordinary culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and other neceſſary local occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without interruption. Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the common rank might ſerve in ſquadrons of horſe, (if they preferred
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0481800300:41"/>
that kind of ſervice,) as <hi>equites,</hi> or <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</hi> Thoſe men whoſe time of ſervice approached, as being next upon the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed <hi>Roſter,</hi> ſhould be more carefully exerciſed <hi>at home, after the hours of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> for one month at leaſt before their time of marching. By theſe means they would be prepared for the ſervice; and the very march, if properly conducted, would add to their diſcipline. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of returning, when relieved by companies of their neighbours, in ſo ſhort a time as <hi>one month,</hi> (if they lived ſo long,) or two months, allowing for the march out and home, would much reduce the anxiety of parting from their families and friends.</p>
            <p>It will probably be objected, that a national militia, which has been exerciſed only in ſmall bodies, is incapable of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual ſervice againſt an enemy: but for this a remedy may be found. Let the army be firſt formed in a ſeparate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0481800300:42"/>
at ſuch convenient diſtance from the enemy, that they may not be liable to an immediate attack.</p>
            <p>A central ſituation muſt, of courſe, be choſen for this camp of diſcipline, where the ſeveral companies from the whole nation may be regimented under proper general-officers, and be daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, in <hi>large bodies,</hi> for a whole month (or ſix weeks, if neceſſary) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are brought to face the enemy. And, for this reaſon, it would be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to require from each individual (I mean the firſt time he is entered on the <hi>Roſter</hi>) one month or ſix weeks atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, <hi>more</hi> than the generally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed proportion of time on the <hi>Roſter,</hi> (which would be only once in his whole life-time, and therefore no great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,) in order to be exerciſed with a large body of troops in ſome of the principal and moſt neceſſary movements and evolutions for the field; and, after the month or ſix weeks training in the camp of diſcipline,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0481800300:43"/>
an army of 125,000 men might be marched to the camp or camps of actual ſervice, to do duty for the time allotted to each upon the <hi>Roſter</hi> againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy; and the number might be continually kept up by monthly detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of battalions from the firſt camp of diſcipline, in proportion as the time of ſervice (allotted to each of the former companies upon the <hi>Roſter</hi>) ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The country would alſo be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the returning diſciplined compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies diſperſed in every part; and the knowledge of arms and diſcipline, by the time a <hi>ſingle circulation</hi> of the <hi>Roſter</hi> was completed, (<hi>viz.</hi> in one year,) would be diffuſed throughout the <hi>whole nation;</hi> which would thereby be enabled after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to exert itſelf gloriouſly upon any ſudden emergency; for it might afford to bear even the loſs of ſix ſuch capital ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of 125,000, <hi>viz.</hi> in all, 750,000, men, before it would be neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the time of ſervice from one month
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0481800300:44"/>
to two months actual ſervice, for each diſciplined man, in a whole year. With ſo ſmall a portion of time employed in military ſervice, every man might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his ordinary occupation, either in trade or huſbandry, and maintain his rank and ſituation in life with his family, as a <hi>free citizen, in his own diſtrict,</hi> at all other times, when the <hi>Roſter</hi> of public ſervice did not demand his perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance from home. But when, by a contrary method, a national militia is ſo long continued in actual ſervice, without <hi>rotation,</hi> as to inure the individuals to a neglect and diſuſe of their ordinary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, in their reſpective counties and diſtricts, they gradually loſe their <hi>civil capacity,</hi> and, from <hi>free citizens,</hi> are apt to become <hi>mere ſold-iers,</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on their military <hi>Sold,</hi> or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and the favour of ſuperiors; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they acquire ſuch a ſlaviſh ſubmiſſion to COMMAND, be it <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>unjuſt,</hi> that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0481800300:45"/>
they readily undertake to execute thoſe very meaſures and deſigns, which they themſelves, perhaps, have previouſly condemned; alledging, that <q>a ſoldier has no right to judge for himſelf,</q> (thus indiſcriminately applying, to the general propriety or impropriety of any military undertaking, a principle, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relates only to the neceſſary diſcipline and mode of conducting it in the field, after a man has abſolutely conſented and engaged to ſerve in it,) <q>and that a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier muſt go</q> (ſay they) <q>wherever he is ordered, without any demur about the propriety or injuſtice of the ſervice.</q> So that they eſtabliſh not only a <hi>paſſive,</hi> but an <hi>active, obedience</hi> to the will of others, which makes the profeſſion <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable! — diſhonourable,</hi> I mean, in thoſe who admit this doctrine of <hi>unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted obedience,</hi> which is derogatory to their <hi>natural dignity, as men;</hi> for they give up an indiſpenſible quality of <hi>human nature,</hi>

            <p>Citizens of London, from the moſt ancient times, were required to keep arms in their houſes. The annual muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is rather a <hi>muſter of the arms</hi> than of <hi>the men,</hi> who would probably go out to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0481800300:49"/>
               <hi>actual</hi> ſervice, if there ſhould be really occaſion for them; but even the meaneſt of <hi>the men,</hi> as they now are generally ſent out, (being for the moſt part ſubſtitutes,) if they were exerciſed for a few hours three times a week, only for one month, and reſtrained from the uſe of ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors during the time of exerciſe, would be found more ſerviceable (if there was any real occaſion of public defence) than is generally conceived.</p>
            <p>Of this real facts afford the beſt proof: the irregularity of the Trained Bands and want of diſcipline were as conſpicuous and notorious, it ſeems, in the year 1642, as at preſent: for, when Capt. Skippon (afterwards Major-General) was directed by the parliament to attend them, as a guard, with two companies of the <hi>Trained Bands</hi> of London, Lord Clarendon's account of that matter is expreſſed in the folloWing contemptuous terms; <q>This man</q> (ſays he, meaning Skippon)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0481800300:50"/>
               <q>marched that day in the head of their <hi>TUMULTUARY ARMY</hi> to the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-houſe.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Bk iv. p. 380.</note> Yet Lord Clarendon himſelf makes ample reparation to the <hi>Trained Bands</hi> for this contempt, when he ſpeaks of their <hi>unexpected</hi> behaviour at the battle of Newbery; for, though he allows their <hi>inexperience both of danger and ſervice,</hi> he expreſſly attributes to the <hi>ſteadineſs</hi> of the Trained Bands the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the parliament's army. No troops in the kingdom had at that time been able to withſtand the ſpirited char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Prince Rupert's well-diſciplined horſe, till this <hi>tumultuary army,</hi> (which ſeems to be an exact deſcription alſo of their preſent muſters,) for the firſt time, compelled them to wheel about.</p>
            <p>Rapin ſpeaks of the brave defence of the <hi>infantry</hi> on that day in very high terms, but without mentioning what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular troops they were; ſo that no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would ſuſpect that he deſcribed the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0481800300:51"/>
actions of the <hi>"tumultuary army"</hi> of the city.</p>
            <p>
               <q>After the Prince had routed <hi>the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry</hi> of the enemy,</q> (ſays Rapin, meaning the <hi>parliament's cavalry,</hi>) <q>he fell upon their <hi>infantry,</hi> which, though deprived of the help of the cavalry, received him with ſo much <hi>intrepidity,</hi> that he was <hi>repulſed</hi> ſeveral times, without being able ever to penetrate.</q>

            <p>Thus the <hi>City Pike-men</hi> are commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſtandard pattern of military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, (viz. for their <q>readineſs, order, and dexterity, in the uſe of arms,</q>) by

the very ſame hiſtorian who had entitled them <hi>a tumultuary army</hi> a very ſhort time before this occaſion which extorted his commendation. A moderate and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſcipline, for real ſervice, is more eaſily and ſooner acquired than people generally conceive; and nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent eſtabliſhment of City Trained Bands but more frequent muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for about an hour or an hour and a half at a time, <hi>after the hours of labour:</hi> for, if they were allowed this advantage, they would be nearly upon the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Militia of New England, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which lately conquered the well-diſciplined army of General Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne: they would be nearly upon the <hi>ſame footing,</hi> I ſay, except in one point; which is, that the <hi>New England Militia</hi> have always maintained the ancient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional right of chooſing their own officers in the public <hi>Folkmotes:</hi> which the learned Judge Atkins, by the beſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,

has proved to be the original conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our national Militia. Polit. Tracts, p. 254.</p>
            <p>The preſent eſtabliſhment of the <hi>county regiments of Militia</hi> ſavours too much of a <hi>ſtanding army,</hi> both in <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> and <hi>the effect</hi> of the ſervice upon the <hi>common men;</hi> who, by being abſent too long a time from their families and ordinary occupations, are apt to become <hi>mere ſoldiers,</hi> deſpiſing their former trades and employments, and conſequently <hi>cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be citizens.</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—and ſo they certainly are, with reſpect to <hi>perſonal dignity,</hi> or <hi>rank,</hi> when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>as individuals;</hi> and yet the <hi>ſovereignty,</hi> or <hi>ſupreme power,</hi> belongs of right to the people, i. e. to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of them, or to the majority of their duly elected repreſentatives. <hi>"And therefore,"</hi> (we may ſay with that learned caſuiſt, Bp Taylor, in his Ductor Dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantium, lib. iii. c. rule 1, p. 522.) <q>it is but a weak and uſeleſs diſtinction when we ſpeak of kings and princes, (by them meaning the <hi>SUPREME POWER,</hi>) to ſay that ſome are <hi>ABSOLUTE,</hi> ſome are <hi>LIMITED</hi> in their power.</q> — That is, the diſtinction is weak and uſeleſs only when we mean to ſpeak of the <hi>ſupreme power:</hi> this is clearly the biſhop's meaning, as the following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text will ſhew; for otherwiſe the diſtinction to be made between <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>limited "kings and princes"</hi> is ſo far from being <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> that it is the neceſſary and proper criterion between the <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> dominion of kings; the <hi>limited</hi> alone being <hi>legal</hi> in this kingdom. <q>For <hi>(the biſhop adds)</hi> it is true that ſome princes are ſo</q> (i. e. <hi>are</hi> LIMITED <hi>in their power); "but then"</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they "are</hi> NOT <hi>the</hi> SUPREME <hi>power."</hi> (This is directly to the point in queſtion; and he adds a farther illuſtration of it:) <q>It is a contradiction <hi>(ſays he)</hi> to ſay that the <hi>SUPREME POWER</hi> is limited or reſtrained; for that which <hi>RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRAINS</hi> it is <hi>SUPERIOR</hi> to it, and therefore the other is <hi>NOT SUPREME.</hi>
                     </q> That a king ought not to have the <hi>ſupreme power</hi> is clearly laid down by the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the Engliſh <hi>Common Law;</hi> and particularly by Judge Bracton, one of the moſt ancient as well as the moſt reſpectable authorities. <q>Rex ſub Deo et Lege. Rex habet <hi>SUPERIOREM,</hi> Deum, <hi>(ſcilicet,)</hi> item <hi>LE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEM,</hi> per quam factus eſt rex; item <hi>CURIAM SUAM,</hi> viz. comes, barones,</q> &amp;c. Bract. lib. 2. c. xvi. p. 34. <hi>"Lex fraenum eſt potentiae,"</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch a power of RESTRAINT is veſted in the LAW, as well as in the LEGISLATORS of this <hi>limited</hi> monarchy, is clearly proved by Mr. Acherley in his book on free parliaments. He argues from the words of the <hi>original writs of ſummons to parliament,</hi> — that the <hi>determining or deciſive power,</hi> demanded by the ſaid writs, (<hi>ad faciendum ea,</hi> i. e. the inſuperable and urgent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for which the parliament is called,) is <hi>derived from the people,</hi> and is <hi>independent;</hi> and his inference is good; and he gives a remarkable inſtance of this <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent power in the people;</hi> which is their anſwer to the pope reſpecting the baniſhment of Adomar, Bp of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, in 1258. Ann 43. Hen, 3. Viz. <q>Si dominus rex et regni majores hoc vellent, COMMUNITAS tamen ipſius (Adomar) ingreſſum in Angliam jam nullatenus ſuſtineret.</q> 
                     <q>That, if the king and lords would do this thing, (meaning, if they would revoke the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>yet the commons</hi> WOULD NOT SUFFER <hi>or bear Adomar's</hi> reſidence in England.</q> 
                     <q>And the commons cauſed their ſpeaker, Petrus de Montford, <hi>'vice totius communitatis,'</hi> to ſign, and he did ſign, this anſwer.</q> p. 9.</p>
                  <p>From this example, therefore, as well as from a great multitude of other inſtances of the power of the <hi>Engliſh commons,</hi> it is manifeſt that there is <hi>no ſupreme power</hi> in England without the concurrence and aſſent of <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> not a <hi>general aſſent,</hi> once for all, to throw <hi>the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> into other hands, but an <hi>eſpecial aſſent</hi> for every new circumſtance that may be liable to affect their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. For which cauſe, alſo, parliaments ought (indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably) to be newly elected <hi>every ſeſſion,</hi> according to ancient uſage, i. e. <q>every year once, and more often if need be</q>; and that in as <hi>equal</hi> a proportion of <hi>repreſentation</hi> as poſſible; becauſe, the more <hi>equitable</hi> in this point it is made, the more conducive it will ſurely be to the happineſs and true permanent intereſt both of king and people.</p>
                  <p>But if, on the contrary, by the modern <hi>innovations</hi> of <hi>triennial</hi> and <hi>ſeptennial</hi> elections, reduction of the right of voting, venality of almoſt depopulated boroughs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>ſupreme power</hi> ſhould be gradually corrupted, it muſt become a <hi>ſupreme</hi> evil to the deſtruction of <hi>good government</hi> and <hi>peace!</hi> for, in ſuch a corrupted ſtate, nothing can thrive under it but <hi>ſtanding armies,</hi> and that which always regularly attends their eſtabliſhment throughout all the branches of the fourth, or Roman, tyranny, I mean the <hi>belluina poteſtas</hi> of imperial <hi>will</hi> and <hi>command,</hi> againſt which the vengeance of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is clearly denounced; ſo that thoſe perſons, who yield themſelves inſtruments to promote either the one or the other, are guilty of the groſſeſt impiety! A free militia, therefore, is the only juſt and legal means of internal national defence.</p>

            <p>AS the ſole purpoſe of <hi>Military Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations</hi> is to ſupport the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> and to join <q>the power of the countie,</q> when legally ſummoned by ſheriffs, <hi>&amp;c. for common defence,</hi> it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that each aſſociated company be formed, upon principles as oppoſite to thoſe of <hi>ſtanding armies</hi> (valour and good diſcipline excepted) as can poſſibly be deviſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0481800300:67"/>The <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> natural rights of individuals, and the preſervation of their <hi>civil capacity,</hi> muſt therefore be conſidered as objects of the utmoſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and conſideration; in order to which <hi>the freedom of election</hi> in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of <hi>officers,</hi> and a <hi>frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of choice</hi> therein, are abſolutely neceſſary to be maintained.</p>
            <p>Let the whole corps of Aſſociators in every neighbourhood, or <hi>vicinage,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves into ſmall bodies, of ten perſons each, in their reſpective diſtricts; and let each ten, or decennary, chooſe from among themſelves a <hi>tithing-man,</hi> or ſerjeant, to ſuperintend the diſcipline of the ten, and to receive and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them all ſummonſes from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate, or orders from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Aſſociation,</hi> and to tranſact ſuch other buſineſs as the nature of the <hi>Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> may require: the power of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, nevertheleſs, to be ſubject to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0481800300:68"/>
of a majority of the ten, who chooſe them reſpectively; and no other <hi>military</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ſhould be appointed, except officers of <hi>Platoons</hi> for a ſingle day; viz. when the corps is divided into Platoons for exerciſe (agreeable to the mode recommended by General Bland, p. 66): at which time each platoon ought to chooſe its own leader, whoſe power ſhould ceaſe with that day's exerciſe. An experienced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt, however, be choſen at a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious general meeting, to inſtruct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the corps in the general manoeuvres and evolutions of the field, who ſhould, from time to time, be appointed <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding-officer of the day.</hi> In times of actual ſervice, the Lord-Mayor, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſheriffs that are preſent, muſt be conſidered as the legal commander of the aſſociation.</p>
            <p>As three decennaries, or ſerjeants guards, will be the proper complement for a <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon,</hi> ſo two platoons, or ſix decennaries,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0481800300:69"/>
(being ſixty men,) will be a convenient number for a <hi>company,</hi> and ten ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies a ſufficient number for a <hi>battalion,</hi> or ward diviſion; as it will be equal to two townſhips or two county hundreds.</p>
            <p>There ſhould be, <hi>within</hi> each ward, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places appointed for drilling, or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the common exerciſe</hi> to <hi>ſmall parties;</hi> and alſo one place, more ſpacious, for thoſe that are become expert in handling their arms, to be taught <hi>the platoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,</hi> to form themſelves into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to march, wheel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, if a place cannot be found <hi>within the ward,</hi> ſufficiently ſpacious for ſuch a <hi>general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of the whole body, it is probable that two or three places may be found therein ſufficient for the exerciſe of <hi>ſingle companies,</hi> or at leaſt of <hi>ſingle platoons,</hi> which ſhould be appropriated accordingly; and none of theſe places of exerciſe ſhould be open to the inſpection of ſtrangers, as it muſt be irkſome to gentlemen to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0481800300:70"/>
before they have acquired ſome tolerable knowledge of the military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. One place of <hi>general rendezvous</hi> ſhould likewiſe be appointed <hi>within each ward,</hi> for the neighbours to aſſemble in caſe of any ſudden alarm.</p>
            <p>To prevent the individuals of the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation from being injured in their <hi>civil</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, care muſt be taken, that the times of <hi>drilling and private exerciſe</hi> be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both before and after the uſual hours of labour; and that an option be given to the learners of attending either at the <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> or <hi>evening exerciſe,</hi> as ſhall be moſt convenient to themſelves, that no man may be induced to neglect or injure his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling or <hi>occupation,</hi> by which his <hi>civil capacity</hi> is maintained: and, for the ſame reaſon, the times of <hi>public exerciſe in larger bodies</hi> ſhould not be <hi>more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
than is abſolutely neceſſary for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>a moderate and uſeful diſcipline,</hi> rather than a critical nicety in the military
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0481800300:71"/>
manoeuvres; which latter would take up more time than <hi>men of buſineſs</hi> can uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpare; and which muſt finally have the bad effect of tiring out many of the moſt uſeful members of ſociety: and, therefore, it is not only neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the <hi>too great frequency</hi> of ſuch meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but alſo the <hi>duration</hi> of each meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as little time may be loſt to the individuals as poſſible; and that thoſe who attend may not incur the neceſſity of <hi>taking any refreſhment whatſoever</hi> while they are out <hi>on exerciſe,</hi> or in <hi>going</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,</hi> which would otherwiſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion many inconveniences too obvious to be mentioned, beſides an <hi>unneceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> to individuals, which ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be avoided in large <hi>promiſcuous</hi> ſocieties, becauſe <hi>all</hi> cannot <hi>equally</hi> afford it. But, if any man has acquired ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved an appetite, that he cannot endure four or ſix hours exerciſe (and a general review, if properly conducted, will not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0481800300:72"/>
require more time) <hi>without taking food or liquor,</hi> he ought to be eſteemed totally unqualified for the Aſſociation, till he can cure himſelf of ſuch an <hi>unmanly</hi> and diſgraceful habit, which is entirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the <hi>military duty</hi> even of <hi>a citizen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Single decennaries, ſingle platoons, or even ſingle companies, ſhould not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to march into the country, <hi>with their arms and uniforms,</hi> by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe or <hi>amuſement to themſelves,</hi> without an expreſs leave, given by a general meeting of the aſſociators, nor without due caution to be taken for preſerving good order, by the attendance of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number of peace-officers, to prevent any diſputes or affrays with ſtrangers, leſt the indiſcretion of a few individuals of the corps, on ſuch an excurſion, ſhould injure the reputation of the whole body of aſſociators.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0481800300:73"/>
writer, in a tract, entitled <q>
                  <hi>An Inquiry into the legal Mode of ſuppreſſing Riots,</hi>
               </q> ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved; that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation ſhould <q>
                  <hi>not,</hi> UNNECESSARILY, <hi>march through ſtreets or highroads, nor make any the leaſt</hi> MILITARY PARADE, <hi>but conſider themſelves entirely as a part of the</hi> CIVIL STATE.</q> And they ought alſo carefully to obſerve the caution referred to by his fifth rule, reſpecting the uſe of <hi>arms in ſuppreſſing</hi> RIOTS, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>that it is extremely hazardous for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons to proceed to thoſe extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in common caſes;</q> and that they ſhould not attend to any <hi>private</hi> perſon that ſhall <q>
                  <hi>PRESUME</hi> to raiſe the power of the county, which is the province of the ſheriff, under-ſheriff, or magiſtrate,</q> but let them wait for a <hi>legal</hi> ſummons from thoſe that have the proper authority, before they <hi>take their arms</hi> to aſſiſt in keeping the peace; though they have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0481800300:74"/>
certainly a right to aſſemble as <hi>neighbours, without their arms,</hi> to conſult, and uſe all peaceable endeavours to allay or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ill conſequences of any ſudden commotion that has occaſioned an alarm.</p>
            <p>By the conſtitution of this kingdom, as well as by many expreſs laws ſtill in force, <hi>apprentices, wards, and indeed lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of all ranks and conditions, from fifteen to ſixty years of age,</hi> are required <hi>to have arms,</hi> and be duly <hi>exerciſed</hi> in the uſe of them, for the national defence. (See p. 9-24.) It would therefore well become the houſekeepers of every ward, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe who are members of any ward-aſſociation, to encourage their <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, ſervants,</hi> and <hi>dependents,</hi> to learn their <hi>military exerciſe,</hi> (with the common <hi>militia-arms</hi> belonging to each houſe,) at ſuch places in the ward as may be appointed for that purpoſe; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of which ſhould firſt be defrayed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0481800300:75"/>
by the reſpective <hi>ward-aſſociations,</hi> until the utility of the meaſure is rendered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the wards at large, that the houſe-keepers at each wardmote maybe induced to adopt it. For, by theſe means, the houſe-keepers might always have a ſufficient number of able and well-inſtructed <hi>ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, to ſerve for them in the militia,</hi> which would thereby be reſcued from the oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium of <hi>incapacity,</hi> with which it has ſo frequently of late been charged; and the neceſſity of any <hi>new reform of the City-Militia</hi> (which might be attended with very dangerous conſequences to the rights and liberties of citizens) would be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by precluded. And if, in caſe of any more tumults or riots, <hi>an armed City-watch</hi> ſhould again be thought neceſſary, theſe diſciplined <hi>Militia-ſubſtitutes in each ward</hi> might be enrolled in a <hi>Roſter</hi> for that particular ſervice, under the proper Militia-officers; and their attendance might be ſo divided and diminiſhed, by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0481800300:76"/>
a due <hi>Roſter,</hi> as to be very little burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the individuals enrolled; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a ſmall ſtipend to each, for the time of his actual attendance, would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to render the ſervice <hi>voluntary.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Or <hi>Volunteers</hi> might be invited, by rewarding a certain adequate proportion of <hi>watch-duty</hi> with the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the city;</hi> and by ordaining that no artificer or journeyman, employed in the city, be moleſted as a <hi>Non-freeman,</hi> provided he enters himſelf a <hi>Volunteer</hi> on the watch-roll of the ward wherein he is employed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The appearance, alſo, of the City Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia might be rendered more reſpectable, by the addition of <hi>drill-jackets,</hi> with ſome proper diſtinction of <hi>uniform facings,</hi> to denote the ward or diſtrict of each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
