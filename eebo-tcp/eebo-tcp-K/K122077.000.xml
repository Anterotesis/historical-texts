            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yes; I will be Lord of my own Tenement, and keep my Houſhold in Order. Wou'd you, wou'd do ſo too, Maſter; for, look you, I have been Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitour in a College at Salamancha, and read Philoſophy with the Doctors; where I found that a Woman, in all Times, has been obſerv'd to be an Animal hard to underſtand, and much inclin'd to Miſchief. Now as an Animal is always an Animal, and a Captain always a Captain, ſo a Woman is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Woman: Whence it is that a certain Greek ſays, her Head is like a Bank of Sand; or, as another, a ſolid Rock; or, according to a third, a dark Lanthorn. Pray, Sir, obſerve, for this is cloſe Reaſoning; and ſo as the Head is the Head of the Body; and that the Body without a Head, is like a Head without a Tail; and that where there is neither Head nor Tail, 'tis a very ſtrange Body: So I ſay a Woman is by Compariſon, do you ſee (for nothing explains things like Compariſons) I ſay by Compariſon, as Ariſtotle has often ſaid before me, one may compare her to the raging Sea; for as the Sea, when the Wind riſes, knits its Brows like an angry Bull, and that Waves mount upon Rocks, and Rocks mount upon Waves; that Porpuſſes leap like Trouts, and Whales ſkip about like Gudgeons; that Ships roll like Beer Barrels, and Mariners pray like Saints; juſt ſo, I ſay, a Woman—A Woman, I ſay, juſt ſo, when her Reaſon is ſhipwreck'd upon her Paſſion, and the Hulk of her Underſtanding lies thump, thump, thumping againſt the Rock of her Fury; then it is, I ſay, that by certain Immotions, which —um—cauſe, as one may ſuppoſe, a ſort of Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive—yes—hurricanious—um—like—in ſhort, a Woman is like the Devil. But here come the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles to weep us into Mercy.</p>
