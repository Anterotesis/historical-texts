            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE late riots and popular tumults which have happened in the Metropolis and its environs, ſufficiently at the inſtant of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, excited the apprehenſions of all ranks of people, to awaken curioſity and make a clear and ſuccinct narrative worthy the acceptance of the public. To render the whole affair as intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as poſſible, it has been judged neceſſary to trace the alledged cauſe of diſcontent, the Act for the relief of the Papiſts, to its ſource. The original motion for the bill, which afterwards paſſed into a law, was made in the Houſe of Commons by Sir George Savile: the object of it was, to repeal an act of the 10th and 11th of William the Third.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0925800200:9"/>
The eſverity of this act may be gathered from the repealing act, an abſtract of which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, and from the following obſervations of the members who introduced and ſupported the bill.</p>
            <p>Sir George Savile ſtated, that one of his principle views in propoſing this repeal was, to vindicate the honour and aſſert the principles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion, to which all perſecution was, or ought to be totally averſe. That this pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ought not to have had an exiſtence, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution had been lawful. That it ill became us to practice that with which we reproached others. That he did not meddle with the vaſt body of that penal code, but ſelected that act on which he found moſt of the proſecutions had been formed, and which gave the greateſt ſcope to the baſe views of intereſted relations and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled informers. The act had not, it is true, been regularly put in execution, but ſometimes it had, and he underſtood that ſeveral Papiſts lived in great terror, and ſome under actual contribution. He ſtated the peaceable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of this part of his Majeſty's ſubjects, and mentioned the loyal and excellent addreſs they had lately preſented to the throne, in which, they not only expreſſed their obedience to the Government under which they lived, but their attachment to the conſtitution. As a guard and ſecurity however, he propoſed, that a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0925800200:10"/>
teſt <note n="*" place="margin">Vide abſtract of the act, page 4.</note>might be formed, by which they ſhould bind themſelves to the ſupport of the Civil Government as by law eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The motion was ſeconded by Mr. Dunning, who with great ability entered into a legal diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the principles, the objects, and the paſt operations of the bill, which was moved to be repealed. Some of the ſeverities by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of were the following,—for Prieſts or Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits to teach or officiate in the ſervices of their church, were acts of felony in foreigners, and high treaſon in the natives of this kingdom. The forfeiture of eſtates to the next Proteſtant heir, the power given to a ſon or other neareſt relation, to take poſſeſſion during the life of the proprietor, and the depriving of Papiſts from acquiring any legal property by purchaſe, were, he ſaid, exceedingly oppreſſive, particularly the laſt clauſe, which had a far greater latitude than was underſtood, for it applied to all legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty acquired by other means than that of deſcent. He declaimed upon the horrid nature of that law, <hi>which deprived a Prieſt of liberty,</hi> only for officiating in the duties of his religion, and begged to remind the Houſe, that even when the propoſed repealing act had paſſed, the Prieſts would not be at liberty to exerciſe their functions, but would ſtill, under the reſtriction of former laws, be liable to a year's impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0925800200:11"/>
and the puniſhment of a heavy ſine. He obſerved, that at the inſtigation of the moſt abandoned of mankind, common informers, the magiſterial and judicial powers, were of neceſſity bound to enforce all the ſhameful penalties of the act. Others of theſe penalties, held out the moſt powerful temptations for the commiſſion of acts of depravity, at the very thought of which our nature recoils with horror. They ſeem calculated to looſen all bands of ſociety, to diſſolve all civil, moral, and religious obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and duties, to poiſon the ſources of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic felicity, and to annihilate every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of honour. The encouragement given to children, to lay their hands upon the eſtates of their parents, and the reſtitution which debars men from the honeſt acquiſition of property, need, he ſaid, in times like theſe, of philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal liberty, only be mentioned to excite the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt indignation of that Houſe. (A)</p>
            <p>The motion was received with univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and a bill was accordingly brought in and paſſed without a ſingle negative.</p>
            <p>The indulgencies granted by this act to the Papiſts, ſuch as, not only the free exerciſe of their religion in licenſed chapels, equal to the Preſbyterians and all other Diſſenters and Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, but toleration likewiſe <hi>to e ect ſchools</hi> for the education of youth in the Romiſh tenets,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0925800200:12"/>
greatly alarmed many people, ſome on religious, and others on political principles. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made to a ſimilar act in favour of the Catholics in Scotland, (B) contributed to ſpread the alarm, and bills were diſperſed, and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements inſerted in the news-papers, inviting thoſe who wiſhed well to the cauſe, to unite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of the Proteſtant Aſſociation, and Lord George Gordon, who had been ſo active at the head of the Malcontents in Scotland was choſen preſident. Little notice was taken of theſe ſocieties, and the preſident, whoſe eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric and deſultory character (C) and ſpeeches in the Houſe of Commons were frequently the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ridicule, tended rather, both in and out of Parliament, to place thoſe objects, which, as it has proved, well deſerved the moſt ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in a ludicrous than a ſerious point of view. He has the manners and air of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Puritan; his figure is meagre, his hair ſtrait and his dreſs plain. The ſtile of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements publiſhed in the name of the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating Committee, but which were ſigned only by him, have the appearance of private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the public, and are ſuch as might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been expected from the famous Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Prynne, than from a noble Commoner in this philoſophic age. The following is one of theſe advertiſements, which at the ſame time that it affords a ſpecimen of the ſpirit and ſtile, in which theſe invitations were written, will ſhew

by what means the attention of the people was engaged, and their minds were incited to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the tendency of the repealing act, and which only became ſerious in the opinion of the liberal, from the encouragement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection it gave the Papiſts in the <hi>erecting of ſchools.</hi>

Lord George had frequently ſpoken in terms which ſeemed intended to intimidate the Houſe of Commons; and, in order to ſhew that he was more in earneſt, and had more power than they believed, he took every method to incite the public attention. A report was circulated that he had aſſerted he would not preſent the Petition, unleſs he was attended by <hi>forty thouſand</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Another account ſays 20,000.</note>of the Aſſociators at the leaſt. Every one who wiſhed well to the cauſe, was deſired to appear with a blue cockade in his hat. The Aſſociators ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves into four grand diviſions, as requeſted in the advertiſement; the London, the Weſtminſter, the Southwark, and the Scotch; and flags were provided for each.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, on Friday, June the 2d, at ten in the forenoon, an immenſe concourſe aſſembled at the place appointed, ſome with ſerious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome with wicked, and others out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity: and, notwithſtanding the intenſe heat, which was, that day, very remarkable, kept pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rading the fields with their flags, ſinging hymns, marſhalling themſelves in ranks, and waiting for their leader. About eleven o'clock, Lord George arrived among them, and gave directions in what manner he would have them proceed, and about twelve, (that the whole city might be convinced how ſerious the people were in their demands) one numerous party was ordered to go round over London Bridge, another over Blackfriars,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0925800200:17"/>
and a third to follow him over Weſtminſter. A huge roll of parchment, <note n="*" place="margin">Or rather ſeveral rolls in one.</note>too, almoſt as much as a man could carry, containing the names of thoſe who had ſigned the Petition, was borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. They proceeded with great decorum and decency on their route, and the whole body was aſſembled, about half paſt two, before both Houſes of Parliament, on which occaſion they gave a general ſhout.</p>
            <p>But however peaceable and well diſpoſed ſome of them might be it was very evident, from the habit and appearance of numbers amongſt them, that order and regularity were not long to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſuch an aſſembly; on the contrary, they ſoon began to exerciſe the moſt arbitrary and dictatorial power over both Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. They obliged almoſt all the Members to put blue cockades in their hats, and call out, "No Popery!" Some they compelled to take oaths to vote for the repeal of the obnoxious act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others they inſulted in the moſt indecent and violent manner. They took poſſeſſion of all the avenues from the outer door to the very door of the Houſe of Commons, which they twice at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to force open. The like attempt was made at the Houſe of Lords; but by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the door-keepers, and the care of Sir Francis Molyneux, it did not ſucceed. The Archbiſhop of York was one of the firſt they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked. As ſoon as his coach was known com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0925800200:18"/>
down Parliament-ſtreet, he was ſaluted with hiſſes, groans, and hootings; and when he got out of his carriage, to avoid greater miſchief, was obliged to ſay (which he did in a pitiable and enfeebled voice) "No Popery, no Popery!" The Lord Preſident of the Council, Lord Bathurſt, they puſhed about in the rudeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and kicked violently on the legs. Lord Mansfield had the glaſſes of his carriage broken, the pannels beat in, and narrowly eſcaped with life. The Duke of Northumberland was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ill treated, and had his pocket picked of his watch. The Biſhop of Litchfield had his gown torn. The wheels of the Biſhop of Lincoln's carriage were taken off, and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might be ſaid to eſcape perſonal injury al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by miracle. (D)</p>
            <p>The Lords Townſhend and Hillſborough came together: the latter, who was known by the mob, was moſt groſly inſulted, and had not ſome of them been partial to Lord Townſhend, would, in all probability, have been much more ſo: as it was, they were both much huſſeled and puſhed about, and ſent into the Houſe without their bags, and with their hair hanging looſe on their ſhoulders. The coach of Lord Stormont was broken to pieces, and himſelf in the hands of the mob for near half an hour, during which time they took the moſt inſolent liberties with him, and pelted him with mud: he was reſcued
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0925800200:19"/>
at laſt by a gentleman who harangued the mob, and prevailed on them to deſiſt. Lords Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham and Boſton were treated not only with moſt unwarrantable indignity, but with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs and unmanly ſeverity, particularly Lord Boſton, who was ſo long in their power that it was thought neceſſary by the Peers to go as a body and endeavour, by their preſence, to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, but were prevented by the entrance of his Lordſhip, out of breath and in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, with his coat all powdered and his hair diſheveled. The front glaſs of Lord Trentham's vis â vis was broken, and himſelf inſulted and detained a conſiderable time. Lord Willough by de Broke, Lord St. John, Lord Dudley, and many others, were perſonally ill treated; and Wellbore Ellis, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was obliged to take refuge in the Guildhall of Weſtminſter, (whither he was purſued) the windows of which were broke, the doors forced, and Juſtice Addington, with all the conſtables, expelled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Ellis eſcaped at the utmoſt hazard, and after exceedingly ſevere and rough treatment.</p>
            <p>The behaviour of Lord George Gordon was ſuch as might be expected. He came ſeveral times to the top of the gallery ſtairs, whence he harangued the people, and let them know the bad ſucceſs their Petition was like to meet with. He told them firſt, that it was propoſed to take it into conſideration on Tueſday in a Committee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0925800200:20"/>
of the Houſe, but that he did not like delays, for the Parliament might be prorogued by that time.</p>
            <p>He came once more, and ſaid he ſaw little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope redreſs from the deciſions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—that they ſhould meet again—that they ought not to deſpair, but to put their truſt in Providence.</p>
            <p>He came a third time, and ſaid, "Gentlemen, the alarm has gone forth for many miles round the city. You have got a very good Prince, who as ſoon as he ſhall hear the alarm has ſeized ſuch a number of men, will no doubt ſend down private orders to his Miniſters to enforce the prayer of your Petition."</p>
            <p>When the mob was raging and roaring in the lobby, General Conway ſat himſelf down by Lord George, and addreſſed him to the following purpoſe: "My Lord, I am a military man, and I ſhall think it my duty to protect the freedom of debate in this Houſe by my ſword; you ſee, my Lord, the Members of this Houſe are this day all in arms. Do not imagine that we will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered or intimidated by a rude, undiſciplined, unprincipled rabble. There is only one entry into the Houſe of Commons, and that is a narrow one. Reflect, that men of honour may defend this paſs;—and that certainly many lives will be loſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0925800200:21"/>
before we will ſuffer ourſelves to be overawed by your adherents. I wiſh, in one word, my Lord, to know whether it is your intention to bring thoſe men, whoſe wild uproar now ſtrikes our ears, within the walls of this houſe?" Soon after General Conway had done ſpeaking with Lord George, Colonel Gordon, a near relation of his Lordſhip's, went up to him, and accoſted him in the following manner: "My Lord George, do you intend to bring your raſcally adherents into the Houſe of Commons? If you do,—the firſt man of them that enters, I will plunge my ſword not into his, but into your body."</p>
            <p>Lord George, it is ſaid, was very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed by what had fallen from General Conway, and his kinſman, Colonel Gordon, and it was in conſequence of what they had threatened, that he came to the top of the gallery ſtairs, and deſired the populace to be quiet, and to truſt to the goodneſs of their cauſe, and to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's clemency and juſtice.</p>
            <p>While his Lordſhip was making his ſecond ſpeech, one of his relations, General Grant, came behind him, and by a gentle violence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw him back into the Houſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid to him, "O Lord George, Lord George! for God's ſake, Lord George! do not lead theſe poor people into any danger."—His Lordſhip, however, made the General no anſwer, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0925800200:22"/>
his harangue—"You ſee, ſaid he, in this effort to perſuade me from my duty, before your eyes, an inſtance of the difficulties I have to encounter with from ſuch wiſe men of this world as my honourable friend behind my back."</p>
            <p>Alderman Sawbridge and others endeavoured to perſuade the people to clear the lobby, but to no purpoſe; and about nine o'clock, different Members conjured them in the moſt earneſt and pathetic manner to diſperſe, informing them at the ſame time of their danger, and of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that was taken to ſend for the Guards. The young gentleman, the Aſſiſtant to the Chaplain of the Houſe of Commons, addreſſed them, but gained nothing except curſes, and "You be damned! Lord George Gordon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever!" ſoon after this, a party of Horſe and Foot Guards arrived. Juſtice Addington was at the head of the Horſe, and was received with a volley of hiſſes; but on his aſſuring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that his diſpoſition towards them was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly peaceable, and that he would order the ſoldiers away, if they would give their honour to diſperſe, he gained their good will. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Cavalry galloped off, and upwards of ſix hundred of the Petitioners, after giving the Magiſtrate three cheers, departed from thence.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the day the attention of the Houſe of Commons had been taken up in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0925800200:23"/>
debates concerning the Mob. When they had obtained ſome degree of order, Lord George in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced his buſineſs with informing them, that he had before him a Petition <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Note F.</note>ſigned by near one hundred and twenty thouſand of his Majeſty's Proteſtant ſubjects, praying "A Repeal of the Act paſſed the laſt Seſſion in favour of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics," and moved to have the ſaid Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition brought up.</p>
            <p>Mr. Alderman Bull ſeconded the motion, and leave was accordingly given.</p>
            <p>Having brought up the Petition, his Lordſhip then moved to have it taken into immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and was again ſeconded by Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman Bull.</p>
            <p>After ſome debate, the Houſe divided, and there appeared ſix for the Petition, and one hundred and ninety-two againſt it. Soon after this the Houſe adjourned, and the mob having diſperſed from the avenues of both Houſes, the Guards were ordered home.</p>
            <p>But though order and tranquility were re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in this part of the town, it was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe elſewhere. The Mob had paraded off in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diviſions from Palace Yard, and (whether inſtigated by religious phrenzy or deſigning men, time alone can diſcover) as a prelude to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0925800200:24"/>
devaſtations which were to follow, went ſome of them to the Romiſh Chapel in Duke-ſtreet, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and others to that in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-ſtreet, Golden-ſquare, both of which they in a great meaſure demoliſhed. The military were ſent for with the utmoſt expedition to both places, but could not arrive time enough at either to prevent the miſchiefs. Thoſe who had the command of the military were very cautious of proceeding to extremities, much ſcuffling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and ſome few were ſlightly wounded with the bayonets. Thirteen of the rioters were taken, and the mob, for that night, diſperſed without any farther miſchief.</p>
            <p>The concluſion of this evening's diſturbance may be ſaid, to be only the beginning of thoſe dreadful ſcenes of deſolation which have ſince enſued; and which when the perpetrators are long ſunk into oblivion, ſhall be recorded as ſome of the moſt unparalleled and daring out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages hiſtory can furniſh.</p>
            <p>The riots which were ſo alarming on Friday evening partly ſubſided on the Saturday, and the peaceable part of the inhabitants imagined it was nothing more than the intemperate fury of a few miſguided zealots, aſſiſted by thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants, who always mingle with the mob, whoſe trade is plunder, and who are therefore continually active in all ſcenes where tumult and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0925800200:25"/>
anarchy prevail. But this was by no means the caſe, for on Sunday in the afternoon, the rioters aſſembled in large bodies, and attacked the chapels and dwelling-houſes of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics in and about Moorfields. They ſtript their houſes of furniture, and their chapels not only of the ornaments and inſignia of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but tore up the altars, pulpits, pews, and benches, and made huge fires of them, leaving nothing but the bare walls, and in many places not even them. They publicly avowed their intention to root out Popery, to releaſe thoſe who had been confined in Newgate for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at the Sardinian and Warwick ſtreet chapels on Friday, to pull down the houſes of the juſtices who committed them, and the perſons who gave evidence againſt them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>On Monday the mobs collected again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more formidable. They began to put their threats in execution in different quarters of the town. Some paraded with the reliques of havock, which they collected in Moorfields, as far as Lord George Gordon's houſe, in Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck-ſtreet, and afterwards burnt them in the adjacent fields. Another party went to Virginia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, Wapping, and a third to N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghtingale-lane, Faſt Smithfield, where they ſeverally deſtroyed the Catholic Chapels, and committed other outrages. They ſeemed to have been marſhalled
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0925800200:26"/>
out, and different bodies diſpatched on theſe infernal errands. Mr. Rainsforth, tallow-chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, of Stanhope-ſtreet, Clare-market, and Mr. Maberly of Little Queen-ſtreet, Lincoln's Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, who had appeared as evidences on the examination of thoſe who had been committed, had each of them their houſes, ſhops, &amp;c. ſtript, or as they wantonly termed it, gutted, and the contents committed to the flames. Sir George Savile's houſe in Leiceſter-fields underwent the ſame fate, his crime was preparing and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bill into Parliament in favour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics. Happily for Sir George he had pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently removed his plate and ſome of the moſt valuable of his furniture, and other effects, in a private manner.</p>
            <p>This day alſo, which was held as the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of the King's birth-day, a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was iſſued, promiſing a reward of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, to thoſe who would make diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the perſon or perſons concerned in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing and ſetting fire to the Sardinian and Bavarian Chapels. The perſons formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, too, were re-examined, and ſome were diſcharged, while others were ordered to Newgate, whither they were eſcorted by a party of the Guards, whom, on their return, the mob had the inſolence to pelt. One of the ſoldiers who had been hurt by a ſtone, turned and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his piece; but the commanding officer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0925800200:27"/>
humanely ordered him not to fire; and the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were obliged to make a haſty retreat.</p>
            <p>All ranks of people began to be exceedingly terrified at the lawleſs proceedings of this day; and numbers put blue cockades in their hats, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might now be ſaid to be the enſign of rebellion,) on purpoſe to avoid perſonal injury and inſult.</p>
            <p>We now come to that period of deſolation and deſtruction, when every man began to tremble, not only for the ſafety of the city, but for the conſtitution, for the kingdom, for property, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and life, for every thing that is dear to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or to Engliſhmen.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday all the military in town were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on duty at the Tower, both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, St. James's, St. George's Fields, &amp;c. during the day. Notwithſtanding every precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Lord Sandwich was wounded in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go down to the Parliament Houſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his duty, his carriage demoliſhed, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reſcued by the military with difficulty. The houſe of Lord North was attacked, and only preſerved by the exertion of a party of Light Horſe, who rode over, and wounded with their ſwords, ſeveral of the aſſailants.</p>
            <p>About ſix in the evening one party went to the houſe of Juſtice Hyde, near Leiceſter Fields,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0925800200:28"/>
which they deſtroyed in leſs than an hour; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhortly after, paraded through Long Acre, down Holborn, &amp;c. till they came to Newgate, and publicly declared they would go and releaſe the onfined Rioters. When they arrived at the doors of the priſon, they demanded of Mr. Aker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the keeper, to have their comrades imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately delivered up to them; and upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to do his duty, by refuſing, they began ſome to break the windows, ſome to batter the doors and entrances into the cells, with pick-axes and ſledge-hammers, others with ladders to climb the vaſt walls, while others collected fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, and whatever combuſtibles they could find, and flung into his dwelling houſe. What contributed more than any thing to the ſpreading of the flames, was the great quantity of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold furniture belonging to Mr. Akerman, which they threw out of the windows, piled up againſt the doors, and ſet fire to; the force of which preſently communicated to the houſe, from the houſe to the chapel, and from thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the aſſiſtance of the Mob, all through the priſon. A party of Conſtables, nearly to the amount of a hundred, came to the aſſiſtance of the keeper; theſe the Mob made a lane for, and ſuffered to paſs till they were entirely encircled, when they attacked them with great fury, broke their ſtaffs, and converted them into brands, which they hurled about wherever the fire, which was ſpreading very faſt, had not caught. It is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0925800200:29"/>
almoſt incredible to think that it were poſſible to deſtroy a building of ſuch amazing ſtrength and extent, with ſo much ſwiftneſs as they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed this. As ſoon as the flames had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Akerman's houſe, which was part of Newgate, and were communicated to the wards and cells, all the priſoners, to the amount of three hundred, among whom were four under ſentence of death, and ordered for execution on the Thurſday following, were releaſed. The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Mob was in this inſtance, as well as every other, amazing. They dragged out the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, many of them, by the hair of the head, by the legs or arms, or whatever part they could lay hold of: They broke open the doors of the different entrances, as eaſily as if they had all their lives been acquainted with the intricacies of the place, to let the confined eſcape. Great numbers were let out at the door that leads to the Seſſion's Houſe; and ſo well planned were all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvres of theſe deſperate ruffians, that they had placed centinels at the avenues, to prevent any of the priſoners from being conveyed to other jails. Thus was the ſtrongeſt and moſt durable priſon in England, that had been newly erected, and was not yet finiſhed, and in the building of which the nation had expended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſums demoliſhed, the bare walls excepted, which were too thick and ſtrong to yield to the force of ſire, in the ſpace of a few hours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0925800200:30"/>
Even this was but a moiety of the miſchief of this terrible night. Not ſatiated with the deſtruction of this great building, a party was ſent among the Catholics in Devonſhire-ſtreet, Red Lion-ſquare; another to the houſe of Juſtice Cox in Great Queen-ſtreet, which was ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; a third broke open the doors of the New Priſon, Clerkenwell, and turned out all the confined; a fourth deſtroyed the furniture and effects, writings, &amp;c. of Sir John Fielding; and a fifth deſperate and infernal gang went to the elegant houſe of Lord Mansfield, in Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury-ſquare, which they, with the moſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting fury, ſet fire to and conſumed. The loſs here was immenſe, both to Lord Mansfield as an individual, and to the public. A moſt valuable collection of pictures, ſome of the ſcarceſt manuſcripts ſaid to be in the poſſeſſion of any private perſon in the world, with all his Lordſhip's notes on great law caſes, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of England, were all ſacrificed by mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and villains; and Lord and Lady Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field were with difficulty preſerved from their rage, by making their eſcape through a back door, a few minutes before theſe miſcreants broke in and took poſſeſſion of the houſe. The military was ſent for, but arrived too late; they were obliged, however, to fire in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſix men and a woman were killed, and ſeveral wounded. Not contented with the havock and deſtruction they had been guilty of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0925800200:31"/>
in Bloomſbury, they went from thence to his Lordſhip's country ſeat at Caen Wood, which would certainly have ſhared the ſame fate, had not they been repelled by a party of Horſe which had been ſent thither for the preſervation of this delightful place. The inhabitants were obliged this night to illuminate their windows.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to give any adequate deſcription of the events of Wedneſday. Notice was ſent round to the public priſons of the King's Bench, Fleet, &amp;c. by the Mob, at what time they would come and burn them down. The ſame kind of infernal humanity was exerciſed towards Mr. Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, a diſtiller in Holborn, and ſeveral other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh individuals. Three boys went through the ſtreets, and in particular down Holborn, in the middle of the day, with iron bars, got from the railing before Lord Mansfield's houſe, extorting money at every ſhop huzzaing and ſhouting, "No Popery!" and though numbers were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and repaſſing, the inhabitants durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them money; nor durſt any body attempt to ſecure them, to have them puniſhed. Small parties of the like daring nature were formed in other parts, and the whole city was laid under contribution. One man in particular was mounted on horſeback, and refuſed to take any thing but gold. Two men in the broad day, not contented with the former miſchief, got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mr. Mabberly's houſe in Queen-ſtreet, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0925800200:32"/>
ſtaid for upwards of an hour knocking down the wainſcoting, and every bit of wood work they could, with ſafety to themſelves; and though a great many peaceable well dreſſed people looked on, no one moleſted them. In the afternoon all the ſhops were ſhut, and bits of blue ſilk, by way of flags, hung out at moſt houſes, with the words, "No Popery," chalked on the doors and window ſhutters, by way of deprecating the fury of the inſurgents, from which no perſon thought himſelf ſecure.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the day was drawing towards a cloſe, one of the moſt awful and dreadful ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles this country ever beheld was exhibited. The mob had not only declared their reſolution of firing the priſons, and ſome private houſes, but had avowed their intention to deſtroy the Bank, Gray's Inn, Temple, Lincoln's Inn, the Grand Arſenal at Woolwich, and Royal Palaces. A univerſal ſtupor had ſeized the minds of men: They looked at one another, and waited with a reſigned conſternation for the events which were to follow. Government indeed had exerted it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the utmoſt, as far as their power, under the direction of the civil magiſtrate, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. Now, however, it was become neceſſary to make uſe of the royal prerogative, and give diſcretionary powers to the military. Nothing could convey a more awful idea of the miſchief which was dreaded, than the ſtrong guard which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0925800200:33"/>
was placed in the Royal Exchange for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Bank, as nothing perhaps could have equalled the national deſolation, had the diabolical purpoſes of the inſurgents upon this place ſucceeded. Beſides this, ſoldiers were diſtributed at Guildhall, in the Inns of Court, in almoſt every place tenable as a fortification, and in ſome private houſes; and the cannon was diſpoſed to the beſt advantage in the Park.</p>
            <p>With minds thus prediſpoſed to terror by ſo many objects of devaſtation, and in a city which but a few days before enjoyed the moſt perfect tranquility, let thoſe who were not ſpectators judge what the inhabitants felt when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held at the ſame inſtant the flames aſcending and rolling in vaſt and voluminous clouds from the King's Bench and Fleet Priſons, from New Bridewell, from the Toll gates on Blackfriars Bridge, from houſes in every quarter of the town, and particularly from the bottom and middle of Holborn, where the conflagration was horrible beyond deſcription. The houſes that were firſt ſet on fire at this laſt mentioned place, both belonged to Mr. Langdale, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diſtiller, and contained immenſe quantities of ſpirituous liquors. It is eaſy to conceive what fury theſe would add to the flames; but to form an adequate idea of the diſtreſs of the neighbouring inhabitants, or indeed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in every part of the city, is not ſo eaſy.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0925800200:34"/>
Men, women, and children were running up and down with beds, glaſſes, bundles, or whatever they wiſhed moſt to preſerve. In ſtreets where there were no fires, numbers were remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their goods and effects at midnight. The tremendous roar of the inſatiate and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fiends who were the authors of theſe horrible ſcenes, was heard at one inſtant, and at the next the dreadful report of ſoldiers muſkets, as if firing in platoons, and at various places; in ſhort, every thing which could impreſs the mind with ideas of univerſal anarchy, and approaching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, ſeemed to be accumulating. Sleep and reſt were things not thought of; the ſtreets were ſwarming with people, and uproar, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and terror reigned in every part.</p>
            <p>It is hardly poſſible to collect, in one point of view, the havock of this night; had half the miſchief the Mob had threatened been effected, nothing leſs than national bankruptcy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction could have enſued: that they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented at thoſe places, on the ſafety of which the very exiſtence of the empire might be ſaid to depend, was owing not to their want of will but power, and to the exertion of Government. They made two attempts upon the Bank; but were ſo much intimidated by the ſtrength with which they beheld it guarded, that their attacks were but feebly conducted. They were led on to the firſt by a brewer's ſervant on horſeback, who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0925800200:35"/>
had decorated his horſe with the chains of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; but were repulſed at the firſt fire from the Military, and their ſecond ſucceeded no better. They made an effort to break into the Pay Office likewiſe, and met the ſame fate. Several of them fell in theſe ſkirmiſhes, and many more were wounded, as the importance of theſe places made it neceſſary to ſhew but little lenity.</p>
            <p>The Regulars and Militia had poured in ſo faſt, in conſequence of the expreſſes diſpatched for that purpoſe, that the citizens on Thurſday began to recover from a conſternation in which many of them, eſpecially thoſe whoſe duty it was to have taken the moſt active part poſſible, had been diſgracefully ſtupified. They were, however, ſo thoroughly alarmed, and ſo much affected by the depredations they beheld on every ſide, that the ſhops were univerſally ſhut from Tyburn to Whitechapel, and no buſineſs of any kind, except at the Bank, was tranſacted; and here, the run, inſtead of being greater than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, was near 80,000l. leſs, a proof that the arrival of the troops had quieted their fears.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to aſcertain the number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and deluded wretches who loſt their lives on the laſt dreadful night; but it is a conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that very few innocent people, or people of credit, a Banker's Clerk excepted, were among the killed. The eſcape of one young lad, though
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0925800200:36"/>
perhaps he might not deſerve ſo good a fate, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, from its ſingularity, a place in this Narration. While the Fleet Priſon was burning, the Mob had the audacity, notwithſtanding the preſence of the Military, to cut the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pes from, and toſs into the flames, a large engine which had been brought to play upon the contiguous buildings. The ſoldiers were thereupon ordered to diſperſe them. Among others, there were four people ſeated upon the roof of the Market-houſe, who refuſed to obey the Military, and who were therefore ordered to fire. The diſcharge of the muſkets came from three directions, in the front, and at each ſide, ſo that it ſeemed impoſſible for any one to eſcape, and for a conſiderable time they all four lay dead, as was ſuppoſed. At length, however, one of them was obſerved to raiſe his head a little, and inſtantly clap it down and lay ſtill again; he repeated this manoeuvre two or three times, till at laſt he ventured to ſlide down, and ran away with great celerity. He was by far the genteeleſt in appearance of the four. The three were ſhot dead at the inſtant, and two were on one ſide of him, and one on the other. One of the dead was a chimney-ſweeper, about ſixteen years old, and had forty guineas in his pockets.</p>
            <p>The toll-gates at Black friars appear to have been burnt for the ſake of the plunder: there were ſome lives loſt there too, and one man who was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0925800200:37"/>
ſhot, ran thirty or forty yards before he dropped, as appears by the blood which may be traced in plaſhes on the pavement.</p>
            <p>But powder and ball do not ſeem to have been ſo fatal to them as their own inordinate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. Numbers, it is ſaid, and at various places, died with inebriation, eſpecially at the diſtilleries of the unfortunate Mr. Langdale, from whoſe veſſels the liquor ran down the middle of the ſtreet, was taken up by pailfuls, and held to the mouths of the beſotted multitude; many of whom killed themſelves with drinking non-recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſpirits, and were burnt or buried in the ruins. Eight or nine of theſe miſerable wretches have been found and dragged out. (I) The ſame ſcenes of beaſtly drunkenneſs happened in many other places; at Mr. Cox's, at Lord Mansfield's, where an ill-looking fellow, about nineteen, that was wounded, and had his hair clotted with blood, was too drunk, at one o'clock the next day, to be made ſenſible; at Newgate likewiſe many of them had made ſo free with the liquor that they could not get away, and were burnt in the cells. In the ſtreets men were lying upon bulks and ſtalls, and at the doors of empty houſes, drunk to a ſtate of inſenſibility, and to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of danger: boys and women were in the ſame condition, and many of the latter with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in their arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0925800200:38"/>
There were ſix and thirty (K) fires all blazing at one time, and all to be ſeen from one ſpot, made from the furniture of the inhabitants, and the wrecks of their houſes in and about the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Queen-ſtreet and little Ruſſel-ſtreet, Bloomſbury. A perſon who ſtood and beheld this ſcene with horror, ſaid to the Officer who was there with a party of ſoldiers, that he thought a deal of the miſchief might be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the perpetrators appeared chiefly to be boys. This diſcourſe was overheard by another perſon, a well dreſſed decent-looking man, who damned the ſpeaker's blood and bade him get home to bed.</p>
            <p>But tho' centinels were poſted at every avenue, and every ſhop was ſhut, tho' the whole city had the appearance of a place that every moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be ſtormed, and was ſo well defended that nothing leſs than a regular army could have endangered it, yet the inhabitants could by no means perſuade themſelves they were entirely ſecure. Not only were their doors all ſcrawled with chalk, intimating that they were no Papiſts, and their windows decorated with blue flags or ribbands, but the very Jews, in Houndſditch and Duke's Place, were ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that they followed the general example, and, unintentionally, gave an air of ridicule to what they underſtood in a very ſerious light, by writing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0925800200:39"/>
on their ſhutters, "This houſe is a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant."</p>
            <p>The Military were exceedingly active all the day, and ſecured great numbers of the diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; fifty were taken in the Cells of Newgate attempting to rekindle the fire in thoſe few parts, which on account of the vaſt extent of the building, had not been totally deſtroyed. It is remarkable that ſeveral of the priſoners who had been releaſed by the mob, had ſo great an affection for thoſe ſcenes to which they had been long accuſtomed, that they could not forbear loitering about the Cells, and coming to view them, and were accordingly retaken. Many others were found ſauntering near their old haunts in Cloth Fair, Black Boy Alley, Gravel Lane, &amp;c. by the thieftakers, and re-committed by the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates. Every hour brought intelligence of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of ſome of the inſurgents, as all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons were examined, and all hackney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaches, ſtages, and other vehicles, ſearched. An attack was this day made upon the Marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea Priſon by the Rioters, but they were repelled.</p>
            <p>No ſooner were the diſtreſſed citizens relieved in part from one fear, than they were invaded by another. They beheld, as before related, the Royal Exchange, the Bank, the Inns of Court, every place in the poſſeſſion of an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed force. Their lives and property were the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0925800200:40"/>
moment before at the mercy of a lawleſs and unprincipled rabble. Their rights, their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the conſtitution of England, objects of ſtill greater conſequence, dearer even than life and property, were now at the diſpoſal of the Court. In ſuch colours, however, did the unuſual objects which every where met their eyes paint things to their imaginations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They ſaw ſoldiers, without the leaſt ceremony, ſtop whoever they pleaſed, and no one durſt reſiſt: they were ſenſible of the neceſſity and propriety of ſuch meaſures, yet ſighed at that neceſſity, and trembled for their freedom. Thoſe virtuous citizens, who held their country and their laws ſuperior to every thing, who reflected on and rejoiced at the bleſſings of liberty, and groaned at the appearance only of deſpotiſm, had their terrors greatly increaſed at a report, which every where prevailed, that Martial Law was proclaimed. The following was the occaſion of the report.</p>

            <p>Convinced as they were that it was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, there was not a word in the latter part of the above Proclamation that did not carry a wound to the heart of every thinking and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Engliſhman.

(L)</p>
            <p>While an exact ſtate of the fears of all good patriots is related, it is but juſtice to give Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment praiſe for the proper uſe they made of the power they were thus obliged to uſurp. No part of their conduct reflects greater honour on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0925800200:43"/>
them than the publication of the following hand-bill, if it were done by their direction, which was generally underſtood. Numerous copies of them were given away on Thurſday, and the whole tenor of it ſufficiently juſtifies what has been aſſerted, and what moſt aſſuredly was ſeverely felt, and ſeriouſly thought upon, viz. that the Conſtitution was endangered.</p>

            <p>This account of the public attention to their rights is neceſſarily a part of the Narrative; and is, beſides, due to thoſe who, in times of tumult and diſorder like theſe ſpoken of, had fortitude and virtue enough not to be ſo embarraſſed as to forget that which conſtitutes the greateſt beſſing upon earth. It affords this inſtructive leſſon likewiſe: that it is the duty of good citizens, who have a real, and not merely a verbal love for their country and freedom, to think ſeriouſly of eſtabliſhing that kind of police which ſhall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0925800200:44"/>
enable them to defend themſelves, without the aid of powers which may, ſometimes, be turned to their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Another very proper hand-bill was circulated, and which it is probable was done by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Aſſociation. The following is a copy.</p>

The miſchief which had been perpetrated, and that which was evidently intended, were of ſo black an aſpect, and involved ſo entirely the deſtruction of the empire, that the moſt diſpaſſionate, and thoſe who were leaſt liable to be perverted by idle conjecture, could not help ſometimes think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſaw a wicked head directing the violent and rude hands of the mob. The univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the priſons was a vaſt project; but ſuch a one as was not altogether improbable to be a favourite ſcheme with a lawleſs rabble. Hiſtory furniſhes examples of the like. But no hiſtory can parallel the depth of their ſchemes upon the Bank, the Treaſury, and the demolition of the water-works, thereby to prevent the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing any conflagration they had begun; and that theſe ſchemes were not the chimeras of fear, were evident. A ſtrong guard was ſent to the New River head, and continued there on conſtant duty. Excluſive of theſe, the grand Arſenal at Woolwich, the Manſion Houſe, the Inns of Court, and many other places of the greateſt national concern, were devoted, and there was ſcarce a perſon on the Thurſday but was unanimous in ſuppoſing the deſolation of the city and country was intended. Another hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill, beſides thoſe already inſerted, was diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which perhaps might take its riſe from the general opinion; but which, however, tended to give that opinion ſtrength. It was as follows:</p>

                        <p>This is to give notice, that it now appears, that the horrible Riots which have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this city have been promoted by French money, and to call upon all honeſt men to ſtand forth againſt Rioters, who under the cloak of Religion, are wantonly deſtroying our property, and endeavouring to overſet our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſtitution.

            <p>Still farther to confirm theſe conjectures, the Newſpapers of Friday gave accounts of louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ors being found upon ſome of the Rioters who had been killed or taken; and what at laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely gave it credit, was the apprehending, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and commitment of Lord GEORGE GORDON. He was conducted to the Tower on Friday evening, under a remarkably ſtrong guard, ſaid to be far the moſt numerous that ever eſcorted a State Priſoner. A large party of infantry was in the front. His Lordſhip follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a coach, in which were two officers. Two ſoldiers rode behind the coach, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed by General Carpenter's regiment of dragoons. After this, came a Colonel's guard of the Foot Guards; and a ſtrong party of Militia marched on each ſide of the carriage.</p>

This tranſaction rung through London, and ſo entirely was he deemed the original Author, and promoter of the Riots, that few were found to pity him. A thouſand ſurmiſes were circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſuch as, `whether religion, avarice, or ambition, was the motive that had prompted him in the action, whether France, (M) or any foreign powers had been abettors; and others of the like nature, equally, at preſent, vague and indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. This much however, ought in juſtice to Lord George to be obſerved, that it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what has hitherto tranſpired, that he has been actuated rather by a wrong head, than a wicked heart. No better account of the whole affair for the preſent than the following, which is copied from the public prints, can be procured.</p>
            <p>The circumſtance that firſt induced the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Adminiſtration to turn their thoughts towards taking the Noble Patron of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Rioters into cuſtody, is ſaid to be this—Lord George, in the heat of his too ſucceſsful enthuſiaſm, wrote a letter, which he ſent for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion to the conductor of a Morning Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, addreſſed to his religious Aſſociates, wherein he recommended them to nouriſh the noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that had ſo laudably taken poſſeſſion of them, and told them that he did not in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree doubt that an unlimited compliance with all their requiſitions would be the undoubted conſequence of their perſeverance. He at the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0925800200:48"/>
ſame time indeed annexed a kind of exhortation for the preſervation of peace and good order; but as this concluding ſuggeſtion was too repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the general tenour of the epiſtle, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo far too faintly urged to produce an adequate effect, the Printer very judiciouſly deemed it the beſt ſtep he could take for the welfare and quiet of his country, to ſend the Copy of this Letter to Government, which he accordingly did, in a note addreſſed to Lord Hillſborough. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, immediately on the receipt of the Letter, cauſed a Council to be convened, before whom he produced it. The unanimous opinion they held upon it was, that it was of a very inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory tendency, and that the Author was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly amenable to the laws, as the Promoter of a traitorous and unconſtitutional ſedition. As a farther ſanction, however, for the meaſures they intended to adopt towards him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an order was immediately iſſued to the Poſt Office, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining all letters franked <hi>G. Gordon,</hi> to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quarter they might be addreſſed, to be from that time detained, and tranſmitted to the office of one of the Secretaries of State. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this mandate, ſeveral letters, written by the deluded young Nobleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were ſtopped, and afterwards laid before the Cabinet. Moſt of theſe were directed to Scotland, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with obſervations equally ſubverſive of order, religion, and liberty. He gave a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful narrative of the tranſactions which had taken
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0925800200:49"/>
place in the Metropolis; and inſtead of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the relation with thoſe expreſſions of horror and diſapprobation which muſt have actuated every good and well-diſpoſed citizen, he ſeemed rather to exult in the event, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pervaded theſe epiſtles but rapturous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums on the "glorious cauſe," and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant panegyrics on the noble ſpirit diſplayed by his Brethren in the defence of it. The uniform tendency of all theſe different letters ſufficiently determined the Cabinet as to the propriety, and indeed neceſſity, of making the Author of them priſoner; and orders were immediately given for that purpoſe. He was firſt brought before the Council aſſembled at St. James's, where he was examined concerning the purport of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious epiſtles, and particularly interrogated as to the nature of his own deſigns and motives in writing them. He diſclaimed all intentions of violating the public peace, and expreſſed the warmeſt attachment for the love of his country, but at the ſame time vindicated his adherence to the cauſe he was concerned in with aſtoniſhing ability and reſolution. To the queſtion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which was frequently and forcibly put, by different members of the Cabinet, how he could ſo far forget his dignity, as an immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant of one of the firſt families of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and alſo a legiſlator of England, as to unite with a ſet of the loweſt men in the kingdom, and to be inſtrumental in producing the ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0925800200:50"/>
diſorders and irreparable injuries which had taken place? he only ſeverally replied, "That he had not foreſeen thoſe effects in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to which they had extended; that he did not mean them; and was ſorry for them." But againſt this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was urged, "Why did he, in all his letters, convey an implied approbation of theſe diſturbances, if ſuch was his diſpoſition of mind as he there repreſented?" His Lordſhip made no good anſwer to this obſervation. After he had undergone an examination of upwards of an hour at St. James's, he was taken to the Horſe Guards, where Lord Amherſt ſat in his capacity of Commander in Chief, and proceeded to a farther ſcrutiny into this dark and diabolical buſineſs. Here more teſtimony appeared; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons were brought who ſwore to certain expreſſions of a moſt inflammatory tendency indeed, which had been uſed by his Lordſhip on the day when the petition was originally preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Houſe of Commons; his haranguing the Mob from the lobby of the Houſe was dwelt upon, and his expreſſions with reſpect to Mr. Burke particularly ſworn to. His preparations for an immediate departure into Scotland, as ſoon as ever the poſſibility of farther miſchief was precluded by the interpoſition of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, was alſo proved as a collateral corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature of his views; and about eight o'clock his examination finally cloſed, with a full conviction on the minds of the auditors, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0925800200:51"/>
"his Lordſhip had been principally inſtrumental in convening the riotous multitude, which had for ſix ſeveral days and nights infeſted the ſtreets of the metropolis, and that he had been by his ſpeeches, &amp;c. abetting in producing the great and irreparable miſchief to his Majeſty's loyal and faithful ſubjects, which had ſubſequently ariſen."—What his Lordſhip may have to urge in exculpation of this dreadful charge, on the day of trial, has not yet tranſpired; but it is hoped, for his own ſake, and for the ſake of the Honourable Family he ſprung from, that he will be able to make ſome defence againſt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſo black and infamous a dye.</p>

            <p>It now remains to collect ſuch circumſtances, which either eſcaped notice in the haſte with which this account was obliged to be drawn up, or which could not without injuring the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, have been inſerted in any other place, and which may ſerve to corroborate what has been before aſſerted, relative to the audacity and wickedneſs of the rioters. The account ſhall

            <p>On Wedneſday evening the Rev. B. Allen was robbed in the ſtreet, oppoſite Mr. Langdale's diſtillery, Holborn-bridge, between eight and nine o'clock by a gang of pick-pockets, ſome of whom forcibly held him whilſt his pockets were picked of a gold French made watch, ſeals, &amp;c. a purſe with two guineas and a half, his keys, and other articles;—his pockets were turned inſide out. A perſon decently dreſſed held his cane, and returned it very civilly when the affair was over.</p>
            <p>Three or four ſeveral times during the general conflagration at Mr. Langdale's, &amp;c. a ſingle fellow, with a blue cockade and a bludgeon, demanded money for the gang, threatening thoſe who made the leaſt heſitation, in Bedford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>row, and the adjacent ſtreets; and ſo terrified were the inhabitants, his demands were complied with. But a ſtronger proof ſtill of the infatuation of the mob, who concluded they had effected the total ſubverſion of order, was the following. On Saturday, when every place was guarded, and all things peaceably ſettled in their former channel, a man had the temerity
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0925800200:53"/>
to demand money, in the middle of the day, in Holborn. He, however, was preſently ſecured.</p>

            <head>ANECDOTES <hi>of the Life of</hi> LORD GEORGE GORDON. <note n="*" place="margin">In juſtice to the author, it is mentioned that theſe anecdotes are by another perſon.</note>
            </head>
            <p>LORD George Gordon is third ſon to the late Duke of Gordon. He was born in London, about the year 1747 or 1748, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at an early age into the navy. He roſe to the rank of Lieutenant, and there, owing to ſome diſguſt or diſappointment, he gave up his commiſſion. His enemies take occaſion to ſay that he retired becauſe Lord Sandwich would not grant a very imprudent requeſt which he made for a ſhip, on the moment of his having procured a ſeat in the Houſe; they ſay that he threatened the Firſt Lord of the Admiralty, to throw himſelf into the arms of the Oppoſition if he did not comply with his demand, and on his Lordſhip's refuſal, that he actually did take a decided part againſt Miniſters, and by that means quarrelled with the Duke, his brother. His friends give a very different account of this buſineſs. They ſay, that from his earlieſt years he expreſſed a very zealous, if not a violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Conſtitution of this country, and though of an amorous complexion, that he paid his court to her as his darling miſtreſs.—Having while a Midſhipman been in America, he had conceived a very particular affection for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0925800200:61"/>
the inhabitants, and when the ruinous meaſures were purſuing in Parliament, which terminated in the diſmemberment of the empire, he took a decided part againſt Miniſters from conviction, and not from diſappointment. Having done this, and thereby had a temporary diſagreement with the Duke, his brother, he had no reaſon to believe that Lord Sandwich would permit him to riſe in the way of his profeſſion; and he left a ſervice in which, in the preſent day of degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and corruption, men riſe by intereſt, and not by merit.</p>
            <p>No man had juſter pretenſions to independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though few perhaps in the Houſe were poorer than Lord George Gordon. He has preſerved through life the moſt guarded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent oeconomy, and with an income of between 7 and 800l. a year has maintained his integrity firm and inviolate, notwithſtanding the attacks which Miniſters have from time to time made upon it. One of their practices, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with indignant ſpirit, publiſhed in the Houſe; Lord North, he ſaid, had been guilty of an <hi>infamous</hi> attempt to bribe him with a place of a 1000l. a year, to give up his ſeat in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This charge the Miniſter received with a diſtorted face; he denied that he had been guilty of an <hi>infamous</hi> attempt, but he never intended to diſprove the charge. This ſtory is differently told. It is ſaid that the Duke, his brother, made
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0925800200:62"/>
application to the Miniſter for his place, and there were ſeveral interviews between them on the ſubject. The place was promiſed to his Lordſhip with the condition of his giving up his ſeat, and on this ground the treaty was broke off.</p>
            <p>The part that his Lordſhip has taken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Proteſtant Aſſociation is too recent in the minds of men to require recapitulation. He did not take an active part in oppoſition to the Bill in favour of the Papiſts, at the time of its paſſing; becauſe, as his Lordſhip ſays, "he had not then become a ſpeaker." We are well aſſured that his Lordſhip had no idea of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the dreadful conſequences that enſued from aſſembling the Aſſociation. He was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, at the ſame time, that unleſs the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtants was ſtrengthened by an Aſſociation, there was no reaſon to apprehend that any regard would be paid to it. The meaſures which he adviſed and adopted, were founded on his knowledge of the venality of Parliament; and his worſt enemies muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he has acted openly and candidly throughout the whole buſineſs. He gave the Houſe to underſtand that 150,000 men had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to have the Act repealed; nay, he even proceeded ſo fairly, as to move in his place, that 100,000 ſtand of arms, firelocks, bayonets, and accoutrements might be tranſmitted to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to enable them to put themſelves in array

and accompliſh their purpoſe. The noble Lord has, through life, maintained the character of a facetious companion. He poſſeſſes a great fund of wit, and humour, and his temper is withal ſo ſweetened with the quality of good nature, that he has never been known to ſacrifice it at the ſhrine of ſatire. For the whole of this ſeaſon no man has been more univerſally attended to in the Houſe than his Lordſhip; and he has ſaid ſome of the ſevereſt, and at the ſame time the wittieſt things againſt both ſides of the Houſe, that have been uttered in St. Stephen's ſince the day of the celebrated Charles Townſhend: And ſhould his Lordſhip fall a ſacrifice to his zeal on the preſent occaſion, no man ever received a greater ſhare of public reſpect, than his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will no doubt meet with.</p>

                  <p>MR. Thurloe (the preſent Lord Chancellor) ſpoke to the Bill. The purport of his ſpeech was, that though he did not mean to oppoſe it, he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend caution. He deſired they would conſider what principles the act of William and Mary had been formed upon, and thought the repeal of the penalties againſt Popiſh Prieſts <hi>exerciſing</hi> their function deſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of Peterborough (in the upper Houſe) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the Bill ought to have been introduced at an earlier part of the ſeſſion, by which means the diſpoſition of the nation towards it might have been known; and that it was not only worthy their Lordſhips' attention to look into the real ſecurity of the Conſtitution, but to prevent alarms of imaginary danger with which ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and malice heretofore had kindled, and might again kindle flames which the authority of the law might find it difficult to extinguiſh.</p>

                  <p>THE Biſhop is brother to the Lord Chancellor. Mr. Atkinſon, an attorney of Weſtminſter, gave him ſhelter in his houſe from the fury of the mob, and he eſcaped, after changing his dreſs, over the tops of houſes.

                        <p>That it is with the deepeſt concern they petition the Houſe againſt a law which has lately received the Royal Aſſent; but as this Act is ſo ſuddenly introduced, and ſo haſtily paſſed, before the ſenſe of the nation at large could be obtained, or any oppoſition formed againſt it, they are encouraged to hope that this application will not prove too late for redreſs.</p>

                  <p>LORD Mansfield has given the doctrine of Military interference an explanation as unexpected as it is new. He has conſidered them, not as ſoldiers, but citizens; amenable to the Civil Magiſtrate for their conduct; and having a right to act, in all caſes of tumult, like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, or other perſons. The Public ſeem, unhappily, to have acquieſced, and taken his Lordſhip's word for demonſtration. The doctrine is ſpecious, and its novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, joined to his Lordſhip's reputation, have given it the force of truth: but, if it is conſtitutional, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Government of England and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary one is imperceptible. A ſoldier, who is merely paſſing, is in a very different legal ſituation to a ſoldier under arms, called forth to act offenſively and defenſively: it would ſeem ſtrange to hang that man for murder who only obeyed the word of command. If Lord Mansfield's aſſertion is true, all the ſoldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have been active in ſuppreſſing the Riots are liable to be tried for their lives.</p>

                  <p>THIS is a newſpaper anecdote; but what Mr. Burke pleaded in his Lordſhip's behalf, in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was far more ſevere than any thing his enemies have related or invented: that is, ſuppoſing his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip poſſeſſed of delicacy and feeling; which, however, are things by no means poſitively aſcertained. A daily paper gives Mr. Burke's ſentiments in the following words.</p>
                  <p>All men, he ſaid, were not made alike. The Lord-Mayor, he ſuppoſed, was of a timid nature, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out natural courage and capacity that ſit ſome men to act a wiſe and decided part in trying ſituations. Neither had he made up, he preſumed, the diſadvantages of his natural infirmity and timidity, by ſtudy and culture. As he never dreamt, in his younger days, of filling ſo important a ſtation as that of Lord-Mayor of the City of London, it was probable he had neglected to acquire thoſe talents that might be requiſite, in certain emergencies, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb facs="tcp:0925800200:72"/>
the duties of it: for theſe reaſons, he hoped, they would have mercy on the <hi>poor Lord-Mayor,</hi> in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his natural weakneſs, and <hi>total want of education.</hi>

               <p>IT was not 'till this morning, that a publication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your name, fell into my hand; "A Narrative of the late Riots;' which is penned with a candor and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality that aſſure me, you would be deſirous to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect any aſſertion to the diſadvantage of others, into which you have been miſled either by ignorant or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced miſinformation.</p>
               <p>In the 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d page of your Pamphlet is the following paragraph. <q>It would be wrong to forget the Armed Aſſociations, who turned out on Thurſday, though ſome have accuſed them of being very quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able till the danger was all over.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the foregoing paragraph it is eaſy to diſtinguiſh between two diſtinct particulars: in the firſt ſentence,
<pb facs="tcp:0925800200:73"/>
you ſeem to expreſs ſome favourable ſentiments, of your own, towards the behaviour of the Armed Aſſociations; and, in the ſecond, relate only the remarks which others made on their conduct at the late intereſting criſis.</p>
               <p>As a Volunteer in the London Military Aſſociation of Foot, I think it incumbent on me to inform you, that on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> afternoon we made a tender of our ſervices to the Lord Mayor of London. Before the hour of ſeven, <hi>the ſame evening,</hi> we were under arms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo all night, in the ſame duty with the Regulars; firſt protecting the Manſion Houſe, then marching to ſuch other parts of the City as were actually attacked. Before four in the morning, we had ſecured the Rioters in the houſe of Mr. Donovan, in Broad ſtreet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaved the houſe of his neighbour, Mr. Gorman, from the ruin to which it had been devoted; though not without the painful neceſſity of committing ſome execution on thoſe who were not, by repeated intreaties, to be perſuaded to deſiſt and diſband.</p>
               <p>Very little enquiry would fully aſſure you, that the ſervices of the Armed Aſſociations were vigorouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, and unremittedly continued, from the moment the Civil Magiſtrate could be depended on not to ſuffer them to ſtand the defenceleſs victims of that outrage and abuſe, which they had, with indignation, ſeen the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary expoſed to in the preceding ſtages of the late horrid ſcenes of brutality and confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Regulars were not permitted to do any actual ſervice till the <hi>Wedneſday evening,</hi> and from that very hour, the London Military Aſſociations kept even pace with them, in every endeavour for the preſervation of the deareſt intereſts of the community, from the ruin with which they were threatened.</p>

               <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
               <p>GREAT care has been taken relative to the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of facts. Some have unavoidably been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the <hi>public papers,</hi> but ſuch as nobody contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, ſome <hi>the author</hi> can atteſt, and others were collected from <hi>ſpectators</hi> of undoubted veracity.</p>
               <p>A ſtrong and laſting impreſſion was fixed upon the mind of the Narra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or, by being preſent at many of thoſe ſcenes of horror he has undertaken to deſcribe: an effort has been made to convey them as they were univerſally felt, but that is next to impoſſible.</p>
               <p>A perſon who, in the midſt of uproar and diſtraction, compoſes a Narrative, and gives it in the form of a ſmall pamphlet, cannot be ſuppoſed to write for ſame; but he may be ſtrongly affected by private and public diſtreſs: he may ſigh with a weak and ſickly mother, driven from her habitation at midnight, with all her little ones, terrified and crying, around her: he may groan for a mad, miſguided multitude; toſſing the brands of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on the head of innocence, and expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to preſent, or to future death: he may weep over the ruins of a city, and at the deſolation of its innocent inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The ſubject is worthy the talents of the ableſt hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian: the dignity and caſe of one is little expected in this kind of publication.</p>
               <p>If the Author has communicated ideas, ſo as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a <hi>faint</hi> image of that horror and deteſtation which every good citizen experienced, who was preſent at the perpetration of theſe lawleſs acts, he has effected more than he hoped. Such hope is now only inſpired by the favourable reception the Public gave to the firſt Edition.</p>
