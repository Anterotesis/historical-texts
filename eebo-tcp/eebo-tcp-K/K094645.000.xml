            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Reader is requeſted to conſider the following Poem as nothing more than what a part of its title-page expreſſes,—a SKETCH, and only a ſketch, of the Social Paſſion, or Sympathetic Principle, applied, firſt to the Author's particular ſituation, and thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended more generally, as influencing the whole animal creation.</p>
            <p>Upon viſiting the Villa of a friend, and finding it deſerted by a family extremely dear to the Author, he experienced preciſely the ſenſations he has endeavoured
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0443601100:3"/>to deſcribe. It was natural for him to paſs beyond his own caſe, and contemplate that of others under ſimilar circumſtances. The faireſt productions of animated nature were before him. They occupied the ſame ſpot. He was ſeated in the midſt of them. His heart dilated. If, as ſeems to be admitted, a virtuous enthuſiaſm be neceſſary to the proper enjoyment of ſuch ſcenery, the Critic of Nature will hardly know how to be offended, ſhould he find, that here and there have been indulged effuſions, which, if cloſely examined when the mind is cold, may be ſound not altogether in ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.</p>
            <p>It were eaſy to have thrown out from the argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parts ſome ſentiments not quite in keeping with the theme; but, zealous to prove the powers of Univerſal
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0443601100:4"/>Sympathy, the writer felt the ſollicitudes of an author, united with thoſe of a philanthropiſt. Of courſe, the idea of obliterating what had any chance of cementing the ſocial affections was too painful to be adopted.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, candour ſhould urge that in ſtepping occaſionally out of his path, his intention has been rather to gather flowers than weeds, he will be forgiven. The poetical licence becomes a matter rather of right than of courteſy, when an author pleads his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in the cauſe of Benevolence. He pretends not to have preſerved an exact correſpondence between the ſeveral members.</p>
            <p>Immethodical, however, as the poem confeſſedly is, the <hi>lucidus ordo</hi> of compoſition has not been by any means
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0443601100:5"/>wantonly diſcarded; nor ought the Author to conceal (what it is, indeed, his chief pride to acknowledge) the obligations he is under to ſome of the firſt and greateſt writers in this country, for many valuable hints, of which he has availed himſelf in the courſe of the performance.</p>
