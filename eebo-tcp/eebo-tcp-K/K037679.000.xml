            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE approbation the following Comedy has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the Stage, and the candour with which every criticiſm, that has come to the Author's knowledge, has been accompanied, might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to truſt it to the cloſet without any other preface, than an acknowledgement of his gratitude to the Public, for the honours done to him. And if he detains the reader a few moments more, it is not to diſavow what has been hinted at in ſome of the daily prints, as a ſpecies of plagiariſm, but to plead it in behalf of dramatic writing in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt rules, that if carried to the extent they lead to, would fix ſhackles upon genius, and give a very undue limitation to variety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In point of fable for inſtance</hi>—Is it a reproach to borrow?</p>
            <p>Surely the dramatiſt, like the architect, brings his talents equally to the teſt, whether he builds upon another man's ground or his own. And if inſtead of ſmall and detached parts, the writer of the Heireſs had taken the compleat plot of his play from a novel; he would have imitated the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (the only imitation to which he has any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) of the beſt dramatic Poets of every age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In point of originality of characters</hi>—It is humbly hoped this Comedy is not without it. But preſent inſtances apart, it is ſubmitted to the judicious, whether ſuch an exaction of novelty as would make a reſemblance to any thing ever ſeen upon the ſtage before unacceptable, might not materially vitiate the public taſte, carry the major part of writers beyond the ſcope of nature
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1020700300:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and probability, and deprive the ſpectator of that pleaſing and infinite diverſity of ſhape and colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the leading paſſions, vices, and follies of civiliſed life, admit. Love, avarice, miſanthropy, &amp;c. &amp;c. if drawn a thouſand and a thouſand times with new ſhades, and in different points of view, will do as much credit to invention, and have as juſt an effect in exhibition, as if Moliere or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave had never touched the ſubjects. It is not whether there may not be perſonages in the Heireſs, in whom we may diſcover family features, that is aſked, but whether they are not ſtill individuals, with whom we have been hitherto unacquainted— i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a queſtion, not for the Author to determine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Original thought</hi>—It has been obſerved that there is an image in a ſpeech of Lord Gayville, copied cloſely from Rouſſeau. Very poſſibly it may be ſo. The Author of the Heireſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly has read that elegant writer; and to ſhew how eaſily invention may be deceived, he will quote another writer (in his eſtimation ſtill more elegant) who thus accounts, and apologizes for, unconſcious plagiariſm—<q>"Faded ideas," ſays Mr. Sheridan, "Float in the fancy like half for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten dreams; and imagination, in its fulleſt enjoyments, becomes ſuſpicious of its offspring, and doubts whether it has created or adopted."</q>
            </p>
            <p>More ſentiments and expreſſion due to the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of others, may poſſibly be challenged, though they are equally out of the recollection of the Author.—He would only wiſh the candid to admit the probability, that while he believed them his own, he thought them his beſt.</p>
            <p>Many of the ſcenes now ſubmitted to peruſal, have been ſhortened in repreſentation, and a few
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1020700300:8"/>
words have been altered occaſionally to preſerve connection—a circumſtance neceſſary to be known leſt the performers ſhould be ſuſpected of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, when, on the contrary, too much cannot be ſaid of their attention and zeal. When all have been eminent, it would be unneceſſary, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious, to particularize any: There is nevertheleſs a Lady, to whom, by her ſtanding ſeparately and individually in one part of the performance, the Author, without departing from his maxim, may expreſs his more than ordinary obligation. Miſs Farren, by her inimitable manner of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Epilogue, has made a better apology to the public than any his pen could have produced, for a compoſition which, from an accident, was much too haſtily written in ſome parts, and in others pieced together with a like inſufficiency of time.</p>
            <p>The Epilogue excepted, no defects in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſheets can be covered by the excuſe of hurry: They cannot be ſo, conſiſtently with truth, nor indeed, with inclination: For the Author had rather be thought incapable of pleaſing, after his greateſt cares, than wanting in the attention and reſpect which every man who ventures to publiſh a production of this nature owes to the world and to himſelf—Not to let it paſs from his hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequent reviſal, and the beſt conſidered finiſh his abilities can give.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, Miſs Alton, (ſince you are reſolved to continue that name) you may bleſs yourſelf for finding me out in this wilderneſs— Wilderneſs! this town is ten times more dangerous to youth and innocence: every man you meet is a wolf.</p>

                  <p>Dear Madam, I ſee you dwell upon my indiſcretion in flying to London, but remember the ſafeguard I expected to find here. How cruel was the diſappointment! how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous have been the conſequences! I thought the chance happy that threw a retired lodging in my way: I was upon my guard againſt the other ſex, but for my own to be treacherous to an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, cou'd I expect it?</p>

                  <p>Suſpect every body, if you wou'd be ſafe—but moſt of all ſuſpect yourſelf. Ah, my pretty truant—the heart that is ſo violent in it's averſions, is in ſad danger of being the ſame in it's affections, depend upon it.</p>

                  <p>Madam, I have not a thought, that I will not ſincerely lay open to you. Mr. Heartly is made to pleaſe, and to be avoided; I deſire never to ſee him more—his diſcovery of me here; his letters, his offers, have greatly alarmed me. I conjure you loſe not an hour in placing me under the ſort of protection I ſolicited.</p>

                  <p>If you are reſolved, I believe I can ſerve you. Miſs Alſcrip, the great Heireſs, (you may have heard of the name in your family) has been enquiring among decay'd gentry for a companion. She is too fine a lady to bear to be alone, and perhaps does not look to a huſband's company as a certain dependance.

                  <p>It is ſo ſtrange, that I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a poſitive opinion, till I have read again the collateral papers, and conſider'd fully the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents in your family.

                  <p>She has the faults that wealth and a falſe education create, but they are not incurable. Marry her yourſelf.

                  <p>Your pardon, my dear Harriet, it is done. Sir Clement, my ſiſter's fortune is ſtill far ſhort of what you expected with Miſs Alſcrip; for that deficiency, I have only to offer the virtues, Lord Gayville has proved, and the affection ſhe found it eaſier to control than to coneeal. If you will receive her, thus circumſtanced, into your family, mine has been an acquiſition indeed.</p>

Thro' what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, by what trial, will you find ſelf-intereſt here? What, not one pithy word to mock my credulity!—Alas! poor Yorick—quite chop-fallen. —Forgive me, Sir, I own I am agitated to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance—You thought me diſconcerted at the

            <l>THE Comic Muſe, who here erects her ſhrine,</l>
            <l>To <hi>court your</hi> offerings, and <hi>accepts</hi> of mine,</l>
            <l>Sends me to ſtate an anxious author's plea,</l>
            <l>And wait with humble hope this Court's decree.</l>
            <l>By no Prerogative will ſhe decide,</l>
            <l>She vows, an Engliſh Jury is her pride.</l>
            <l>Then for our Heireſs—forced from finer air,</l>
            <l>That lately fan'd her plumes in Berkeley-ſquare;</l>
            <l>Will ſhe be <hi>helpleſs</hi> in her <hi>new</hi> reſort,</l>
            <l>And find no friends—about the inns of court?</l>
            <l>Sages be candid—tho' you hate a knave,</l>
            <l>Sure, for <hi>example,</hi> you'll a Rightly ſave.</l>
            <l>Be kind for once ye <hi>clerks</hi>—ye ſportive ſirs</l>
            <l>Who haunt our Theatres in boots and ſpurs,</l>
            <l>So may you ſafely preſs your nightly hobby,</l>
            <l>Run the whole ring—and <hi>end</hi> it in the lobby.</l>

               <hi>Poets</hi> may write—<hi>Philoſophers</hi> may dream—</l>
            <l>But would the <hi>world</hi> bear truth in the extreme?</l>
            <l>What, not one Blandiſh left behind! not one!</l>
            <l>Poets are mute, and Painters all undone:</l>
