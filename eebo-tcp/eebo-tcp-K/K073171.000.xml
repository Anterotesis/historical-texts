            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the following Plays were intended only for a private theatre, I have been tempted by that circumſtance to introduce a kind of novelty into our language, by writing three comedies in rhyme, though the Comic Muſe of our country has been long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to expreſs herſelf in proſe, and her cuſtom has the ſanction of ſettled precept, and ſucceſsful example. The Antiquarian, indeed, may remind me that Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Gurton's Needle, one of the earlieſt of our old plays, with other comic productions of that rude pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, was written in rhyme; and poſſibly ſome faſtidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies of that Gothic jingle, as they affect to call it, may conſider the preſent Publication as nothing more than a relapſe into the moſt barbarous mode of dramatic compoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0290500200:8"/>For the boldneſs of an attempt, which has no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern precedent to plead in its behalf, ſome apology may be due to the Public.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I beg it may not be ſuppoſed, that by writing a comedy in rhyme, I mean to convey an indirect cenſure on the contrary practice. No one can prize more highly than I do the many excellent come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in proſe, with which our language is enriched. I am very far from entertaining a wiſh to overturn the ceremonial which the Comic Muſe of England has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; but I hope to find our country as much a friend to toleration in the forms of literature, as in thoſe of religion. The cuſtom of other enlightened nations, both ancient and modern, may be pleaded on this occaſion in behalf of verſe. Ariſtophanes, in his play of the Clouds, ſeems to pride himſelf on his poetry. Arioſto having written two comedies in proſe, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them both into metre at a maturer period of his life; and Moliere, the unrivalled maſter of the French comic theatre, who has written admirably both in proſe and rhyme, is, I think, moſt admirable, and moſt truly comic, when he adheres to the latter.</p>
            <p>To the author who attempts a comedy in Engliſh rhyme, our language ſeems to offer an advantage, which
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0290500200:9"/>
the French poet did not enjoy. The Comic Muſe of France has chiefly confined herſelf to that ſtructure of verſe, which belongs equally to her Tragic Siſter. In the poetry of our nation, this particular meaſure is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to ſportive ſubjects, and though hitherto not uſed in Comedy, it poſſeſſes to an Engliſh ear a very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic vivacity. That it is highly calculated for poems of wit and humour, we have a ſtriking proof in that moſt exquiſite production the Bath Guide. How far it may ſucceed through the varied ſcenes of an Engliſh play, experiment only can determine. As ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, on the firſt ſight of a comedy in rhyme, may haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſuppoſe that the faſhion and the materials of the work are borrowed from the Theatre of France, I think it proper to declare, in juſtice to the writers of that country, that they are by no means anſwerable for any defects which may be found in theſe dramatic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. I am not conſcious of having borrowed a ſingle character or ſituation from any comic writer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, either foreign or domeſtic.—The firſt of the three comedies, contained in the preſent Publication, was founded on a real anecdote related to me by an intimate friend, who, concealing the names of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, mentioned their ludicrous adventure as a new and
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0290500200:10"/>
tempting ſubject for the Comic Muſe.—The plan of the ſecond aroſe in the mind of its author, from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the various effects of Connoiſſeurſhip in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent characters. An attachment to the fine arts, which is allowed to refine and ſtrengthen the virtues of a manly and a generous ſpirit, has perhaps a peculiar ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency not only to ſhew, but to increaſe the narrowneſs of a vain and feeble mind; and if ſuch a tendency exiſts, it is the province of a comic writer to counteract and correct it.—The aim of the third comedy in this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is to laugh at two diſtinct ſpecies of affectation, very prevalent in our age and country; the affectation of refined ſentiment, and the affectation of pompous and pedantic expreſſion. I proteſt however againſt perſonal application: and, to guard againſt it, let me declare, that this ridicule is levelled, not at the great and reſpectable Veteran in the field of literature, whoſe phraſes may ſometimes be borrowed by a character in the play; but at the nameleſs and ſervile herd of his awkward imitators.—Vigor and originality of thought give a ſanction to the pomp and peculiarity of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. If ſingularities of ſtyle are united with genius and moral excellence, they are properly regarded with a partial reſpect; but when theſe ſingularities are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0290500200:11"/>
copied, and ſeem to prevail as a faſhion, they become, I apprehend, very fair ſubjects of ſportive ſatire.</p>
            <p>When I reflect what long and eſtabliſhed prejudice a rhyming play muſt encounter—when I remember that even Dryden himſelf, the moſt able advocate, and the greateſt maſter of rhyme in our language, has expreſsly condemned the uſe of it in comedy—I am alarmed at the hardineſs of my attempt; but when I recollect that time, the moſt infallible teſt of literary opinion, has fully ſhewn the miſtake of that immortal Poet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the uſe of rhyme in Engliſh Tragedy, I am inclined to hope that he might be equally miſtaken in ſuppoſing it utterly unſuited to our Comic Muſe. It may be urged indeed, with great truth, that a comedy in rhyme cannot be ſo cloſe a copy of Nature as a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in proſe, the latter adhering to the very language of common life. But from a ſiſter-art we may borrow, at leaſt a plauſible argument in favour of Poetry, on the preſent occaſion. The great maſter, who has deſcanted ſo happily on the principles of Painting, obſerves with great propriety, in one of his diſcourſes, that
<q>we are not always pleaſed with the moſt abſolute poſſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of an imitation to its original object: caſes
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0290500200:12"/>
may exiſt, in which ſuch a reſemblance may be even diſagreeable. I ſhall only obſerve, that the effect of figures in wax-work, though certainly a more exact repreſentation than can be given by painting or ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a ſufficient proof that the pleaſure we receive from imitation is not increaſed merely in proportion as it approaches to minute and detailed reality: we are pleaſed, on the contrary, by ſeeing ends anſwered by ſeeming inadequate means<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Joſhua Reynolds' Diſcourſe of December 1782.</note>.</q>
—On theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which perhaps are equally juſt in the two kindred arts, a comedy in Rhyme may be ſtill more entertaining than a comedy, of equal merit in other points, which confines itſelf to proſe; and a critic who exclaims againſt the unnatural effect of a rhyming dialogue, may as juſtly cenſure a portrait on canvaſs, becauſe it is not ſo exact a copy of life, as an image of coloured wax. In both caſes the artiſt, whether painter or poet, may be juſtly called a true and a pleaſing copier of Nature, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves as high a degree of reſemblance, as his mode of imitation will admit, and embelliſhes his work with the attractive and almoſt indiſpenſable graces of eaſe, ſpirit, and freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0290500200:13"/>It is ſaid by Voltaire of theatrical compoſition in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,

If the preſent comedies fall not within the claſs which that lively Writer has ſo juſtly proſcribed, the Author may be allowed to hope, that his liberal and enlightened readers will look with indulgence on a publication, which aroſe from his wiſh to introduce a ſtriking, and he truſts not a blamable, variety into the amuſements of Engliſh literature.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE following Tragedy may perhaps attract the notice of the curious reader, more by a literary anecdote relating to its ſubject, than by any intrinſic merit as a dramatic compoſition.</p>
                  <p>The ſtory was recommended to YOUNG by the Author of Clariſſa.—The poet adopted it, and wrote a ſingle act; but this ſhared the fate of his other unfiniſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, and, according to the direction of his will, was committed to the flames.</p>
                  <p>Theſe particulars, with a conciſe ſketch of the ſtory as related by RICHARDSON, were communicated to Mr. THORNTON by the poet's very liberal and amiable Son, the neighbour and the much-eſteemed relation of my dear departed friend, who wiſhed me to build a tragedy upon this foundation.</p>
                  <p>Some particular circumſtances prevented me at that time from executing the deſire of a perſon, who, from the integrity of his judgment, and the uncommon warmth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0290500200:108"/>
of his friendſhip, had an undiſputed title to influence my ſtudies.—Other works had engaged me, and this dramatic ſtory lay for ſome years neglected: but in looking over the letters of my ſtill-valued, though loſt correſpondent, it ſtruck me with new force. As the diſtreſs, with which it abounds, is of a private nature, it appeared to me ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly calculated for my purpoſe of forming a drama for a domeſtic theatre. I have therefore, with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alterations in the principal incident, raiſed from it a tragedy of three acts; with what ſucceſs, it is now the privilege of my readers to pronounce.</p>
                  <p>I will not attempt to influence their deciſion by any arguments in its behalf; but let me be allowed to cloſe this ſhort preface with a little poetical acknowledgment to the two literary illuſtrious friends, who firſt marked the ſtory for the tragic Muſe, and from whom it has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally deſcended to me.</p>

                        <l>DEAR Papa, don't betray me!—her delicate mind</l>
                        <l>Would be wounded, I know, and would think me</l>
                        <l>unkind:</l>
                        <l>So far from allowing, what now I impart,</l>
                        <l>She herſelf little knows the true ſtate of her heart.</l>

                        <l>The ſiſterly fondneſs you warmly diſplay.</l>
                        <l>But you, who for others ſo ſenſibly feel,</l>
                        <l>May here be the dupe of affectionate zeal;</l>
                        <l>And I hope you're miſtaken.</l>

                        <l>My dear Sir, obſerve!</l>
                        <l>You may trace her attachment in every nerve:</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0290500200:254"/>If I name Mr. Beril in ſome idle tale,</l>
                        <l>Poor Fanny will bluſh, and as often turn pale.</l>
                        <l>In his abſence ſtill more and more penſive ſhe grows,</l>
                        <l>Yet thinks not from whence her uneaſineſs flows.</l>
                        <l>And when he returns, tho' her pleaſure is meek,</l>
                        <l>Yet the glow of content may be ſeen on her cheek;</l>
                        <l>And her heart, as if fully conſol'd by his ſight,</l>
                        <l>Appears to repoſe in a tranquil delight.</l>
                        <l>Dear Papa, you'll perceive, if you'll open your eyes,</l>
                        <l>That from none but herſelf ſhe her love can diſguiſe.</l>
                        <l>One other exception perhaps we may find,</l>
                        <l>As I think Mr. Beril is equally blind,</l>
                        <l>And robb'd; like herſelf, of the talent of ſeeing,</l>
                        <l>By that diffident love, which denies it own being.</l>

                        <speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
                        <l>I hope this attachment, which neither has ſhewn,</l>
                        <l>Exiſts, my good girl, in your fancy alone.</l>

                        <speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
                        <l>Why ſo, my dear Sir?—Should it prove, as you fear;</l>
                        <l>I hope, dear Papa, that you won't be ſevere.</l>
                        <l>Conſider the delicate frame of my ſiſter!</l>
                        <l>But I know you've a heart that can never reſiſt her,</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0290500200:255"/>If you once clearly ſee ſhe has fixt her affection,</l>
                        <l>Tho' ſhe own not her wiſhes for ſuch a connection;</l>
                        <l>As you know that her nature's ſo modeſt and meek,</l>
                        <l>She would die from concealment before ſhe would ſpeak.</l>
                        <l>I have ſtrength to encounter the croſſes of life,</l>
                        <l>And to make my part good, as a daughter or wife:</l>
                        <l>But our gentle ſweet Frances is ill-form'd to bear</l>
                        <l>The undeſerv'd load of vexation and care;</l>
                        <l>And therefore ſhould wed, unregardful of pelf,</l>
                        <l>A huſband as tender and mild as herſelf.</l>

                        <l>In the kindneſs of Beril perhaps I might truſt;</l>
                        <l>But the motive you urge for this union, my dear,</l>
                        <l>Is what, I confeſs, would awaken my fear.</l>
                        <l>As you ſay, your mild ſiſter ſhould never be harraſs'd</l>
                        <l>By thoſe various ills with which life is embarraſs'd,</l>
                        <l>I ſhould guard her from all the vexations that wait</l>
                        <l>On a liberal mind with a narrow eſtate:</l>
                        <l>And if Beril had thoughts of becoming my ſon,</l>
                        <l>Had I <hi>not</hi> more objections, yet this muſt be one.</l>

                  <p>LORD RUSSEL; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE endeavoured to delineate, in the following Drama, an exact portrait of the noble Perſonage, whoſe name it bears; as I believe, that a more engaging model of public and private virtue can hardly be ſelected from the annals of any nation: although the extreme mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his temper, the ſimplicity of his manners, and, above all, his unaffected piety, are ſuch qualities, as are very rarely admitted in the formation of a Tragic Hero.</p>
                  <p>To render my performance intereſting to my country, I have adhered as cloſely to our hiſtory, as the nature of dramatic compoſition allowed me to do; and in points where I have varied from hiſtorical truth, ſuch variations are, I truſt, ſupported by dramatic probability.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpirited and judicious introduction to the lately<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed letters of Lady Ruſſel, the teſtimony of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Hiſtorians is collected concerning the ſentiments of Charles the Second and his brother, on the impending fate of Lord Ruſſel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0290500200:278"/>
                     <q>In the Duke of Monmouth's Journal, it is ſaid, that the King told him, he inclined to have ſaved the Lord Ruſſel, but was forced to conſent to his death, otherwiſe he muſt have broke with his brother the Duke of York.</q>
—Kennet.</p>
                  <p>The ſentence juſt quoted, is, I hope, a ſufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the conduct which I have aſſigned to Charles; whoſe character indeed was ſuch, that fiction can hardly impute to him any inſtance of irreſolution, duplicity, and falſehood, which the tenor of his life will not bring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of theatrical credibility.</p>
                  <p>The candid reader will readily allow the liberty I have taken, in laying the ſcene in the Tower, after Ruſſel's condemnation; as it affords many advantages to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the play.</p>
                  <p>In compliance with that reſpect, which dramatic au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have lately paid to the Clerical character, I have not introduced either Tillotſon or Burnet among the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the drama, though the latter was ſo conſtant an attendant on the captivity of my Hero; an omiſſion which I have in ſome degree ſupplied, by the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Spencer; a character drawn from the printed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0290500200:279"/>
trial of Lord Ruſſel, where the name of that gentleman appears in the liſt of thoſe, who gave an honourable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in behalf of the noble priſoner.</p>
                  <p>I have many obligations to the journal written by Burnet, at the requeſt of Lady Ruſſel, which contains all the minute circumſtances that occurred, during the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and at the execution of her Lord. This very intereſting and pathetic narrative is printed in the General Dictionary, under the article Ruſſel. I have not only taken from it many of the ſentiments, which I have aſſigned to him in this Tragedy, but I have ſometimes adopted the very words, that were, really uttered by Lord Ruſſel; and this I have done, not only from an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate admiration of his character, but from a deſpair of ſurpaſſing the elegant ſimplicity, and the force of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>The offer relating to his eſcape, ſo generouſly made, and ſo nobly refuſed, is a fact univerſally known, and muſt render the names of Cavendiſh and Ruſſel an honour to our country, as long as magnanimity and friendſhip retain their juſt value in the eſtimation of mankind.</p>

                        <l>Whoſe reſolution is the pliant ſlave</l>
