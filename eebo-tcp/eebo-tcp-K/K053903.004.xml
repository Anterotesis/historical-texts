            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the evening, when Emily was at length
informed, that Count De Villefort requeſted
to ſee her, ſhe gueſſed that Valancourt was
below, and, endeavouring to aſſume com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
and to recollect all her ſpirits, ſhe
roſe and left the apartment; but on reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the door of the library, where ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
him to be, her emotion returned with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0247300304:4"/>
ſuch energy, that, fearing to truſt herſelf in
the room, The returned into the hall, where
ſhe continued for a conſiderable time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to command her agitated ſpirits.</p>
            <p>When ſhe could recall them, ſhe found in
the library Valancourt, ſeated with the Count,
who both roſe on her entrance; but ſhe did
not dare to look at Valancourt, and the
Count, having led her to a chair, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
withdrew.</p>
            <p>Emily remained with her eyes fixed
on the floor, under ſuch oppreſſion of
heart, that ſhe could not ſpeak, and with
difficulty breathed; while Valancourt threw
himſelf into a chair beſide her, and, ſighing
heavily, continued ſilent, when, had ſhe
raiſed her eyes, ſhe would have perceived
the violent emotions, with which he was
agitated.</p>
            <p>At length, in a tremulous voice, he ſaid,
"I have ſolicited to ſee you this evening,
that I might, at leaſd, be ſpared the further
torture of ſuſpenſe, which your altered
manner had occaſioned me, and which the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0247300304:5"/>
hints I have juſt received from the Count
have in part explained. I perceive I have
enemies, Emily, who envied me my late
happineſs, and who have been buſy in
ſearching out the means to deſtroy it: I
perceive, too, that time and abſence have
weakened the affection you once felt. for
me, and that you can now eaſily be taught
to forget me."</p>
            <p>His laſt words faltered, and Emily, leſs
able to ſpeak than before, continued ſilent.</p>
            <p>"O what a meeting is this!" exclaimed
Valancourt, ſtarting from his ſeat, and pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the room with hurried ſteps, "what a
meeting is this, aſter our long—long ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration!"
Again he ſat down, and, after the
ſtruggle of a moment, he added in a firm
but deſpairing tone, "This is too much—I
cannot bear it! Emily, will you not ſpeak
to me?"</p>
            <p>He covered his face with his hand, as if
to conceal his emotion, and took Emily's,
which ſhe did not withdraw. Her tears
could no longer be reſtrained; and, when
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0247300304:6"/>
he raiſed his eyes and perceived that ſhe
was weeping, all his tenderneſs returned,
and a gleam of hope appeared to croſs his
mind, for he exclaimed, "O! you do pity
me, then, you do love me! Yes, you are
ſtill my own Emily—let me believe thoſe
tears, that tell me ſo!"</p>
            <p>Emily now made an effort to recover her
firmneſs, and, haſtily drying them, "Yes,"
ſaid ſhe, "I do pity you—I weep for you—but,
ought I to think of you with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
You may remember, that yeſter-even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I ſaid, I had ſtill ſufficient confidence
in your candour to believe, that, when I
ſhould requeſt an explanation of your
words, you would give it. This explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is now unneceſſary, I underſtand them
too well; but prove, at leaſt, that your
candour is deſerving of the confidence I
give it, when I aſk you, whether you are
conſcious of being the ſame eſtimable Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court—whom
I once loved."</p>
            <p>"Once loved!" cried he,—"the ſame—the
ſame!" He pauſed in extreme emotion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0247300304:7"/>
and then added, in a voice at once ſolemn,
and dejected,—"No—I am not the ſame!—I
am loſt—I am no longer worthy of
you!"</p>
            <p>He again concealed his face. Emily was
too much affected by this honeſt confeſſion
to reply immediately, and, while ſhe ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
to overcome the pleadings of her heart,
and to act with the deciſive firmneſs, which
was neceſſary for her future peace, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all the danger of truſting long to her
reſolution, in the pretence of Valancourt,
and was anxious to conclude an interview,
that tortured them both; yet, when ſhe
conſidered, that this was probably their laſt
meeting, her fortitude ſunk at Once, and
ſhe experienced only emotions of tenderneſs
and of deſpondency.</p>
            <p>Valancourt, meanwhile, loſt in emotions
of remorſe and grief, which he had neither
the power, or the will to expreſs, ſat inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
almoſt of the preſence of Emily, his
features ſtill concealed, and his breaſt agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by convulſive ſighs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0247300304:8"/>
"Spare me the neceſſity," ſaid Emily, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
her fortitude, "ſpare me the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of mentioning thoſe circumſtances of
your conduct, which oblige me to break
our connection forever.—We muſt part, I
now ſee you for the laſt time."</p>
            <p>"Impoſſible!" cried Valancourt, rouſed
from his deep ſilence, "You cannot mean
what you ſay!—you cannot mean to throw
me from you forever!"</p>
            <p>"We muſt part," repeated Emily, with
emphaſis,—"and that forever! Your own
conduct has made this neceſſary,"</p>
            <p>"This is the Count's determination,"
ſaid he haughtily, "not yours, and I ſhall
enquire by what authority he interferes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us." He now roſe, and walked
about the room in great emotion.</p>
            <p>"Let me ſave you from this error," ſaid
Emily, not leſs agitated—"it is my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and, if you reflect a moment on
your late conduct, you will perceive, that
my future peace requires it."</p>
            <p>"Your future peace requires, that we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0247300304:9"/>
ſhould part—part forever!" ſaid Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
"How little did I ever expect to
hear you ſay ſo!"</p>
            <p>"And how little did I expect, that it
would be neceſſary for me to ſay ſo!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
Emily, while her. voice ſoftened into
tenderneſs, and her tears flowed again.—"That
you—you, Valancourt, would ever
fall from my eſteem!"</p>
            <p>He was ſilent a moment, as if over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
by the conſciouſneſs of no longer
deſerving this eſteem, as well as the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of having loſt it, and then, with impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
grief, lamented the criminality of his
late conduct and the miſery to which it had
reduced him, till, overcome by a recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the paſt and a conviction of the
future, he burſt into tears, and uttered only
deep and broken ſighs.</p>
            <p>The remorſe he had expreſſed, and the
diſtreſs he ſuffered could not be witneſſed
by Emily with indifference, and, had ſhe
not called to her recollection all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
of which Count De Villefort had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0247300304:10"/>
informed her, and all he had ſaid of the
danger of confiding in repentance, formed
under the influence of paſſion, ſhe might
perhaps have truſted to the aſſurances of her
heart, and have forgotten his miſconduct in
the tenderneſs, which that repentance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
            <p>Valancourt, returning to the chair beſide,
her, at length, ſaid, in a calm voice, "'Tis
true, I am fallen—fallen from my own eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem!
but could you, Emily, ſo ſoon, ſo
ſuddenly reſign, if you had not before ceaſed
to love me, or, if your conduct was not
governed by the deſigns, I will ſay, the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
deſigns of another perſon! Would you
not otherwiſe be willing to hope for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation—and
could you bear, by eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
me from you, to abandon me to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery—to
myſelf!"—Emily wept aloud.—"No,
Emily—no—you would not do this,
if you ſtill loved me. You would find
your own happineſs in ſaving mine."</p>
            <p>"There are too many probabilities
againſt that hope," ſaid E.mily, "to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0247300304:11"/>
me in truſting the comfort of my whole
life to it. May I not alſo aſk, whether
you could wiſh me to do this, if you really
loved me?"</p>
            <p>"Really loved you!" exclaimed Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court—"is
it poſſible you can doubt my
love! Yet it is reaſonable, that you ſhould
do ſo, ſince you ſee, that I am leſs ready to
ſuffer the horror of parting with you, than
that of involving you in my ruin. Yes,
Emily—I am ruined—irreparably ruined—I
am involved in debts, which I can never
discharge!" Valancourt's look, which was
wild, as he ſpoke this, ſoon ſettled into an
expreſſion of gloomy deſpair; and Emily,
while ſhe was compelled to admire his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
ſaw, with unutterable anguiſh, new
reaſons for fear in the ſuddenneſs of his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and the extent of the miſery, in which
they might involve him. After ſome
minutes, ſhe ſeemed to contend againſt her
grief and to ſtruggle for fortitude to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the interview. I will not prolong theſe
moments," ſaid ſhe, "by a converſation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0247300304:12"/>
which can anſwer no good purpoſe. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
farewell!"</p>
            <p>"You are not going?" ſaid he, wildly
interrupting her—"You will not leave me
thus—you will not abandon me even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my mind has ſuggeſted any poſſibility
of compromiſe between the laſt indulgence of
my deſpair and the endurance of my loſs!"
Emily was terrified by the ſternneſs of his
look, and ſaid, in a ſoothing voice, "You
have yourſelf acknowledged, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
we mould part;—if you wiſh, that
I ſhould believe you love me, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the acknowledgment."—"Never—never,"
cried he—"I was diſtracted when
I made it. O! Emily—this is too much;—though
you are not deceived as to my
faults, you muſt be deluded into this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperation
againſt them. The Count is the
barrier between us; but he ſhall not long
remain ſo."</p>
            <p>"You are, indeed, diſtracted," ſaid
Emily, "the Count is not your enemy; on
the contrary, he is my friend, and that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0247300304:13"/>
might, in ſome degree, induce you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
him as yours."—"Your friend!" ſaid
Valancourt, haſtily, "how long has he
been your friend, that he can ſo eaſily make
you forget your lover? Was it he, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to your favour the Monſieur
Dupont, who, you ſay, accompanied you
from Italy, and who, I ſay, has ſtolen your
affections? But I have no right to queſtion
you;—you are your own miſtreſs. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,
perhaps, may not long triumph over
my fallen fortunes! Emily, more frightened
than before by the frantic looks of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
ſaid, in a tone ſcarcely audible,
"For heaven's ſake be reaſonable—be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
Monſieur Dupont is not your rival,
nor is the Count his advocate. You have
no rival; nor, except yourſelf, an enemy.
My heart is wrung with anguiſh, which muſt
increaſe while your frantic behaviour ſhews
me, more than ever, that you are no longer
the Valancourt I have been accuſtomed to
love."</p>
            <p>He made no reply, but ſat with his arms
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0247300304:14"/>
reſted on the table and his face concealed
by his hands; while Emily ſtood, ſilent and
trembling, wretched for herſelf and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to leave him in this ſtate of mind.</p>
            <p>"O exceſs of miſery!" he ſuddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
"that I can never lament my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
without accuſing myſelf, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you, without recollecting the folly
and the vice, by which I have loſt you!
Why was I forced to Paris, and why did
I yield to allurements, which were to make
me deſpicable for ever! O! why cannot I
look back, without interruption, to thoſe
days of innocence and peace, the days of
our early love!"—The recollection ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to melt his heart, and the frenzy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
yielded to tears. After a long pauſe,
turning towards her and taking her hand,
he ſaid, in a ſoftened voice, "Emily, can
you bear that we ſhould part—can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to give up an heart, that loves you like
mine—an heart, which, though it has
erred—widely erred, is not irretrievable
from error, as you well know, it never can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0247300304:15"/>
be retrievable from love?" Emily made no
reply, but with her tears. "Can you,"
continued he, "can you forget all our
former days of happineſs and confidence—when
I had not a thought, that I might
wiſh to conceal from you—when I had no
taſte—no pleaſures, in which you did not
participate?"</p>
            <p>"O do not lead me to the remembrance
of thoſe days," ſaid Emily, "unleſs you
can teach me to forget the preſent; I do
not mean to reproach you; if I did, I
ſhould be ſpared theſe tears; but why will
you render your preſent ſufferings more
conſpicuous, by contraſting them with your
former virtues?"</p>
            <p>"Thoſe virtues," ſaid Valancourt,
"might, perhaps, again be mine, if your
affection, which nurtured them, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed;—but
I fear, indeed, I ſee, that
you can no longer love me; elſe the happy
hours, which we have paſſed together, would
plead for me, and you could not look back
upon them unmoved. Yet, why ſhould I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0247300304:16"/>
torture myſelf with the remembrance—why
do I linger here? Am I not ruined—would
it not be madneſs to involve you in
my misfortunes, even if your heart was ſtill
my own? I will not diſtreſs you further.
Yet, before I go," added he, in a ſolemn
voice, "let me repeat, that, whatever may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
my deſtiny—whatever I may be doomed
to ſuffer, I muſt always love you—moſt
fondly love you! I am going, Emily, I am
going to leave you—to leave you, forever!"
As he ſpoke the laſt words, his voice trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and he threw himſelf again into the
chair, from which he had riſen. Emily
was utterly unable to leave the room, or
to ſay farewell. All impreſſion of his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
conduct and almoſt of his follies was
obliterated from her mind, and ſhe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
only of pity and grief.</p>
            <p>"My fortitude is gone," ſaid Valancourt
at length; "I can no longer even ſtruggle
to recall it. I cannot now leave you—I
cannot bid you an eternal farewell; ſay, at
leaſt, that you will ſee me once again."
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0247300304:17"/>
Emily's heart was ſomewhat relieved by
the requeſt, and ſhe endeavoured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that ſhe ought not to refuſe it. Yet
ſhe was embarraſſed by recollecting, that
ſhe was a viſitor in the houſe of the Count,
who could not be pleaſed by the return of
Valancourt. Other conſiderations, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſoon overcame this, and ſhe granted
his requeſt, on the condition, that he would
neither think of the Count, as his enemy,
nor Dupont as his rival. He then left
her, with a heart, ſo much lightened by
this ſhort reſpite, that he almoſt loſt every
former ſenſe of misfortune.</p>
            <p>Emily withdrew to her own room, that ſhe
might compote her ſpirits and remove the
traces of her tears, which would encourage
the cenſorious remarks of the Counteſs and
her favourite, as well as excite the curioſity
of the reſt of the family. She found it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
impoſſible to tranquillize her mind,
from which ſhe could not expel the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the late ſcene with Valancourt, or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0247300304:18"/>
the conſciouſneſs, that ſhe was to ſee him
again, on the morrow. This meeting now
appeared more terrible to her than the laſt,
for the ingenuous confeſſion he had made
of his ill conduct and his embarraſſed cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
with the ſtrength and tenderneſs
of affection, which this confeſſion diſcovered,
had deeply impreſſed her, and, in ſpite of
all ſhe had heard and believed to his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
her eſteem began to return. It fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
appeared to her impoſſible, that he
could have been guilty of the depravities,
reported of him, which, if not inconſiſtent
with his warmth and impetuoſity, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſo with his candour and ſenſibility.
Whatever was the criminality, which had
given riſe to the reports, ſhe could not now
believe them to be wholly true, nor that his
heart was finally cloſed againſt the charms
of virtue. The deep conſciouſneſs, which
he felt as well as expreſſed of his errors,
ſeemed to juſtify the opinion; and, as ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not the instability of youthful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0247300304:19"/>
poſitions, when oppoſed by habit, and that
proſeſſions frequently deceive thoſe, who
make, as well as thoſe, who hear them, ſhe
might have yielded to the flattering perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of her own heart and the pleadings of
Valancourt, had ſhe not been guided by the
ſuperior prudence of the Count. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to her, in a clear light, the danger of
her preſent ſituation, that of liſtening to
promiſes of amendment, made under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of ſtrong paſſion, and the ſlight hope,
which could attach to a connection, whoſe
chance of happineſs reſted upon the retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of ruined circumſtances and the reform
of corrupted habits. On theſe accounts, he
lamented, that Emily had conſented to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
interview, for he ſaw how much it
would ſhake her reſolution and increaſe the
difficulty of her conqueſt.</p>
            <p>Her mind was now ſo entirely occupied
by nearer intereſts, that ſhe forgot the old
houſekeeper and the promiſed hiſtory, which
ſo lately had excited her curioſity, but which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0247300304:20"/>
Dorothée was probably not very anxious to
diſcloſe, for night came; the hours paſſed;
and ſhe did not appear in Emily's chamber.
With the latter it was a ſleepleſs and diſmal
night; the more ſhe ſuffered her memory
to dwell on the late ſcenes with Valancourt,
the more her reſolution declined, and ſhe
was obliged to recollect all the arguments,
which the Count had made uſe of to
ſtrengthen it, and all the precepts, which ſhe
had received from her deceaſed father, on
the ſubject of ſelf-command, to enable her
to act, with prudence and dignity, on this
the moſt ſevere occaſion of her life. There
were moments, when all her fortitude for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
her, and when, remembering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of former times, ſhe thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
that ſhe could renounce Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.
His reformation then appeared cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
the arguments of Count De Villefort
were forgotten; ſhe readily believed all ſhe
wiſhed, and was willing to encounter any
evil, rather than that of an immediate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0247300304:21"/>
Thus paſſed the night in ineffectual ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
between affection and reaſon, and ſhe
roſe, in the morning, with a mind, weakened
and irreſolute, and a frame, trembling with
illneſs.</p>

            <p>VALANCOURT, meanwhile, ſuffered the
tortures of remorſe and deſpair. The ſight
of Emily had renewed all the ardour, with
which he firſt loved her, and which had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
a temporary abatement from abſence
and the paſſing ſcenes of buſy life. When, on
the receipt of her letter, he ſet out for Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,
he then knew, that his own folly
had involved him in ruin, and it was no part
of his deſign to conceal this from her. But
he lamented only the delay which his ill-conduct
muſt give to their marriage, and did
not foreſee, that the information could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
her to break their connection forever.
While the proſpect of this ſeparation over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
his mind, before ſtung with ſelf-reproach,
he awaited their ſecond inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0247300304:23"/>
in a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction,
yet was ſtill inclined to hope, that his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
might prevail upon her not to exact
it. In the morning, he ſent to know at
what hour ſhe would ſee him; and his note
arrived, when ſhe was with the Count, who
had ſought an opportunity of again conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with her of Valancourt; for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the extreme diſtreſs of her mind,
and feared, more than ever, that her forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
would deſert her. Emily having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
the meſſenger, the Count returned to
the ſubject of their late converſation, urging
his fear of Valancourt's entreaties, and again
pointing out to her the lengthened miſery,
that muſt enſue, if ſhe ſhould refuſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
ſome preſent uneaſineſs. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
arguments could, indeed, alone have
protected her from the affection ſhe ſtill felt
for Valancourt, and ſhe reſolved to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by them.</p>
            <p>The hour of interview, at length, arrived.
Emily went to it, at leaſt, with compoſure
of manner, but Valancourt was ſo much
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0247300304:24"/>
agitated, that he could not ſpeak, for ſeveral
minutes, and his firſt words were alternately
thoſe of lamentation, entreaty and ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
Afterward, he ſaid, "Emily, I have
loved you—I do love you, better than my life;
but I am ruined by my own conduct. Yet
I would ſeek to entangle you in a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that muſt be miſerable for you, rather
than ſubject myſelf to the puniſhment,
which is my due, the loſs of you. I am a
wretch, but I will be a villain no longer.—I
will not endeavour to ſhake your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the pleadings of a ſelfiſh paſſion. I
reſign you, Emily, and will endeavour to
find conſolation in conſidering, that, though
I am miſerable, you, at leaſt, may be happy.
The merit of the ſacrifice is, indeed, not
my own, for I ſhould never have attained
ſtrength of mind to ſurrender you, if your
prudence had not demanded it."</p>
            <p>He pauſed a moment, while Emily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to conceal the tears, which came to
her eyes. She would have ſaid, "You
ſpeak now, as you were wont to do," but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0247300304:25"/>
ſhe checked herſelf.—"Forgive me, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,"
ſaid he, "all the ſufferings I have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
you, and, ſometimes, when you
think of the wretched Valancourt, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that his only conſolation would be to
believe, that you are no longer unhappy by
his folly." The tears now fell faſt upon her
cheek, and he was relapſing into the phrenſy
of deſpair, when Emily endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
her fortitude and to terminate an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
which only ſeemed to increaſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of both. Perceiving her tears and that
ſhe was riſing to go, Valancourt ſtruggled,
once more, to overcome his own feelings
and to ſooth hers. "The remembrance
of this ſorrow," ſaid he, "ſhall in future
be my protection. O! never again will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
or temptation have power to ſeduce
me to evil, exalted as I ſhall be by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection
of your grief for me."</p>
            <p>Emily was ſomewhat comforted by this
aſſurance. "We are now parting for ever,"
ſaid ſhe; "but, if my happineſs is dear to
you, you will always remember, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0247300304:26"/>
can contribute to it more, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that you have recovered your own eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem."
Valancourt took her hand;—his eyes
were covered with tears, and the farewell he
would have ſpoken was loſt in ſighs. After a
few moments, Emily ſaid, with difficulty and
emotion, "Farewell, Valancourt, may you
be happy!" She repeated her "farewell,"
and attempted to withdraw her hand, but
he ſtill held it and bathed it with his tears.
"Why prolong theſe moments?" ſaid Emily,
in a voice ſcarcely audible, "they are too
painful to us both." "This is too—too
much," exclaimed Valancourt, reſigning her
hand and throwing himſelf into a chair,
where he covered his face with his hands
and was overcome, for ſome moments, by
convulſive ſighs. After a long pauſe, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which Emily wept in ſilence, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
ſeemed ſtruggling with his grief,
ſhe again roſe to take leave of him. Then,
endeavouring to recover his compoſure, "I
am again afflicting you," ſaid he, "but let
the anguiſh I ſuffer plead for me." He
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0247300304:27"/>
then added, in a ſolemn voice, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
trembled with the agitation of his
heart, "Farewell, Emily, you will always be
the only object of my tenderneſs. Sometimes
you will think of the unhappy Valancourt,
and it will be with pity, though it may not
be with eſteem. O! what is the whole
world to me, without you—without your
eſteem!" He checked himſelf—"I am
falling again into the error I have juſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
I muſt not intrude longer upon
your patience, or I ſhall relapſe into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair."</p>
            <p>He once more bade Emily adieu, preſſed
her hand to his lips, looked at her,
for the laſt time, and hurried out of the
room.</p>
            <p>Emily remained in the chair, where he
had left her, oppreſſed with a pain at her
heart, which ſcarcely permitted her to
breathe, and liſtening to his departing ſteps,
ſinking fainter and fainter, as he croſſed
the hall. She was, at length, rouſed by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0247300304:28"/>
voice of the Counteſs in the garden, and,
her attention being then awakened, the
firſt object, which ſtruck her ſight, was the
vacant chair, where Valancourt had ſat. The
tears, which had been, for ſome time, repreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the kind of aſtoniſhment, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now came to her relief,
and ſhe was, at length, ſufficiently compoſcd
to return to her own room.</p>

            <p>WE now return to the mention of
Montoni, whoſe rage and diſappointment
were ſoon loſt in nearer intereſts, than any,
which the unhappy Emily had awakened.
His depredations having exceeded their uſual
limits, and reached an extent, at which neither
the timidity of the then-commercial ſenate
of Venice, nor their hope of his occaſional
aſſiſtance would permit them to connive,
the ſame effort, it was reſolved, ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
the ſuppreſſion of his power and the
correction of his outrages. While a corps
of conſiderable ſtrength was upon the point
of receiving orders to march for Udolpho,
a young officer, prompted partly by reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0247300304:30"/>
for ſome injury, received from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni,
and partly by the hope of diſtinction,
ſolicited an interview with the Miniſter,
who directed the enterpriſe. To him he
repreſented, that the ſituation of Udolpho
rendered it too ſtrong to be taken by open
force, except after ſome tedious operations;
that Montoni had lately ſhewn how capable
he was of adding to its ſtrength all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which could be derived from the
ſkill of a commander; that ſo conſiderable
a body of troops, as that allotted to the
expedition, could not approach Udolpho
without his knowledge, and that it was not
for the honour of the republic to have a
large part of its regular force employed,
for ſuch a time as the ſiege of Udolpho
would require, upon the attack of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of banditti. The object of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he thought, might be accompliſhed
much more ſafely and ſpeedily by mingling
contrivance with force. It was poſſible to
meet Montoni and his party, without their
walls, and to attack them then; or, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0247300304:31"/>
the fortreſs, with the ſecrecy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the march of ſmaller bodies of
troops, to take advantage either of the
treachery, or negligence of ſome of his
party, and to ruſh unexpectedly upon the
whole even in the caſtle of Udolpho.</p>
            <p>This advice was ſeriouſly attended to, and
the officer, who gave it, received the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the troops, demanded for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
His firſt efforts were accordingly thoſe
of contrivance alone. In the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Udolpho, he waited, till he had ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the aſſiſtance of ſeveral of the condottieri,
of whom he found none, that he addreſſed,
unwilling to puniſh their imperious maſter
and to ſecure their own pardon from the ſenate.
He learned alſo the number of Montoni's
troops, and that it had been much increaſed,
ſince his late ſucceſſes. The concluſion of
his plan was ſoon effected. Having returned
with his party, who received the watch-word
and other aſſiſtance from their friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
Montoni and his officers were ſurpriſed
by one diviſion, who had been directed to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0247300304:32"/>
their apartment, while the other maintained
the ſlight combat, which preceded the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of the whole garriſon. Among the
perſons, ſeized with Montoni, was Orſino,
the aſſaſſin, who had joined him on his firſt
arrival at Udolpho, and whole concealment
had been made known to the ſenate by
Count Morano, after the unſucceſsful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the latter to carry off Emily. It
was, indeed, partly for the purpoſe of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
this man, by whom one of the ſenate
had been murdered, that the expedition
was undertaken, and its ſucceſs was ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to them, that Morano was inſtantly
releaſed, notwithstanding the political ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
which Montoni, by his ſecret accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
had excited againſt him. The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
and eaſe, with which this whole tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
was completed, prevented it from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
curioſity, or even from obtaining
a place in any of the publiſhed records of
that time; ſo that Emily, who remained in
Languedoc, was ignorant of the defeat and
ſignal humiliation of her late perſecutor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0247300304:33"/>
Her mind was now occupied with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
which no effort of reaſon had yet been
able to controul. Count de Villefort, who
ſincerely attempted whatever benevolence
could ſuggeſt for ſoftening them, ſometimes
allowed her the ſolitude ſhe wiſhed for,
ſometimes led her into friendly parties, and
conſtantly protected her, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
from the ſhrewd enquiries and critical
converſation of the Counteſs. He often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
her to make excurſions, with him and
his daughter, during which he converſed
entirely on queſtions, ſuitable to her taſte,
without appearing to conſult it, and thus
endeavoured gradually to withdraw her
from the ſubject of her grief, and to awake
other intereſts in her mind. Emily, to
whom he appeared as the enlightened friend
and protector of her youth, ſoon felt for him
the tender affection of a daughter, and her
heart expanded to her young friend Blanche,
as to a ſiſter, whoſe kindneſs and ſimplicity
compenſated for the want of more brilliant
qualities. It was long before ſhe could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0247300304:34"/>
abſtract her mind from Valancourt
to liſten to the ſtory, promiſed by old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée,
concerning which her curioſity had
once been ſo deeply intereſted; but Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thée,
at length, reminded her of it, and
Emily deſired, that ſhe would come, that
night, to her chamber.</p>
            <p>Still her thoughts were employed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
which weakened her curioſity,
and Dorothée's tap at the door, ſoon after
twelve, ſurpriſed her almoſt as much as if
it had not been appointed. "I am come,
at laſt, lady," ſaid ſhe; "I wonder what
it is makes my old limbs ſhake ſo, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.
I thought, once or twice, I ſhould
have dropped, as I was a coming." Emily
ſeated her in a chair, and deſired, that ſhe
would compoſe her ſpirits, before ſhe entered
upon the ſubject, that had brought her
thither. "Alas," ſaid Dorothée, "it is
thinking of that, I believe, which has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
me ſo. In my way hither too, I
paſſed the chamber, where my dear lady died,
and every thing was ſo ſtill and gloomy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0247300304:35"/>
about me, that I almoſt fancied I ſaw her,
as ſhe appeared upon her death-bed."</p>
            <p>Emily now drew her chair near to Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thée,
who went on. "It is about twenty
years ſince my lady Marchioneſs came a
bride to the chateau. O! I well remember
how ſhe looked, when ſhe came into the
great hall, where we ſervants were all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to welcome her, and how happy my
lord the Marquis ſeemed. Ah! who would
have thought then!—But, as I was ſaying,
ma'amſelle, I thought the Marchioneſs,
with all her ſweet looks, did not look happy
at heart, and ſo I told my huſband, and he
ſaid it was all fancy; ſo I ſaid no more, but
I made my remarks, for all that. My lady
Marchioneſs was then about your age, and,
as I have often thought, very like you.
Well! my lord the Marquis kept open
houſe, for a long time, and gave ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
and there were ſuch gay doings
as have never been in the chateau ſince. I
was younger, ma'amſelle, then; than I
am now, and was as gay as the beſt of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0247300304:36"/>
them. I remember I danced with Philip,
the butler, in a pink gown, with yellow
ribbons, and a coif, not ſuch as they wear
now, but plaited high, with ribbons all about
it. It was very becoming truly;—my lord,
the Marquis, noticed me. Ah! he was a
good-natured gentleman then—who. would
have thought that he!"—</p>
            <p>"But the Marchioneſs, Dorothée," ſaid
Emily, "you was telling me of her."</p>
            <p>"O yes, my lady Marchioneſs, I thought
ſhe did not ſeem happy at heart, and once,
ſoon after the marriage, I caught her crying
in her chamber; but, when ſhe ſaw me, ſhe
dried her eyes, and pretended to ſmile. I
did not dare then to aſk what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but, the next time I ſaw her crying, I
did, and ſhe ſeemed diſpleaſed;—ſo I ſaid
no more. I found out, ſome time after, how
it was. Her father, it ſeems, had commanded
her to marry my lord, the Marquis, for his
money, and there was another nobleman, or
elſe a chevalier, that ſhe liked better and
that was very fond of her, and ſhe fretted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0247300304:37"/>
for the loſs of him, I fancy, but ſhe never
told me ſo. My lady always tried to conceal
her tears from the Marquis, for I have often
ſeen her, after ſhe has been ſo ſorrowful,
look ſo calm and ſweet, when he came
into the room! But my lord, all of a ſudden,
grew gloomy and fretful, and very unkind
ſometimes to my lady. This afflicted her
very much, as I ſaw, for ſhe never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
and ſhe uſed to try ſo ſweetly to
oblige him and to bring him into a good
humour, that my heart has often ached to ſee
it. But he uſed to be ſtubborn, and give her
harſh anſwers, and then, when ſhe found it all
in vain, ſhe would go to her own room, and
cry ſo! I uſed to hear her in the anti-room,
poor dear lady! but I ſeldom ventured to go
to her. I uſed, ſometimes, to think my lord
was jealous. To be ſure my lady was
greatly admired, but ſhe was too good to
deſerve ſuſpicion. Among the many; che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,
that viſited at the chateau, there
was one, that I always thought ſeemed juſt
ſuited for my lady; he was ſo courteous, yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0247300304:38"/>
ſo ſpirited, and there was ſuch a grace, as it
were, in all he did, or ſaid. I always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that, whenever he had been there,
the Marquis was more gloomy and my lady
more thoughtful, and it came into my head,
that this was the chevalier ſhe ought to have
married, but I never could learn for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain."</p>
            <p>"What was the chevalier's name Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thée?"
ſaid Emily.</p>
            <p>"Why that I will not tell even to you,
ma'amſelle, for evil may come of it. I once
heard from a perſon, who is ſince dead, that
the Marchioneſs was not in law the wife of
the Marquis, for that she had before been
privately married to the gentleman ſhe was
ſo much attached to, and was afterwards
afraid to own it to her father, who was a very
ſtern man; but this ſeems very unlikely,
and I never gave much faith to it. As I
was ſaying, the Marquis was moſt out of
humour, as I thought, when the chevalier
I ſpoke of had been at the chateau, and, at
laſt, his ill treatment of my lady made her
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0247300304:39"/>
quite miſerable. He would ſee hardly any
viſitors at the caſtle, and made her live almoſt
by herſelf. I was her conſtant attendant,
and ſaw all ſhe ſuffered, but ſtill ſhe never
eomplained.</p>
            <p>"After matters had gone on thus, for near
a year, my lady was taken ill, and I thought
her long fretting had made her ſo,—but,
alas! I fear it was worſe than that."</p>
            <p>"Worſe! Dorothée," ſaid Emily, "can
that be poſſible?"</p>
            <p>"I fear, it was ſo, madam, there were
ſtrange appearances! But I will only tell
what happened. My lord, the Marquis—"</p>
            <p>"Huſh, Dorothée, what ſounds were
thoſe?" ſaid Emily.</p>
            <p>Dorothée changed countenance, and,
while they both liſtened, they heard, on the
ſtillneſs of the night, muſic of uncommon
ſweetneſs.</p>
            <p>"I have ſurely heard that voice before!"
ſaid Emily, at length.</p>
            <p>"I have often heard it, and at this ſame
hour," ſaid Dorothée, ſolemnly, "and, if ſpirits
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0247300304:40"/>
ever bring muſic—that is ſurely the muſic
of one!"</p>
            <p>Emily, as the ſounds drew nearer, knew
them to be the ſame ſhe had formerly heard
at the time of her father's death, and, whether
it was the remembrance they now revived
of that melancholy event, or that ſhe was
ſtruck with ſuperſtitious awe, it is certain
ſhe was ſo much affected, that ſhe had nearly
fainted.</p>
            <p>"I think I once told you, madam," ſaid
Dorothée, "that I firſt heard this muſic,
ſoon after my lady's death! I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the night!"—</p>
            <p>"Hark! it comes again!" ſaid Emily,
"let us open the window, and liſten."</p>
            <p>They did ſo; but, ſoon, the ſounds
floated gradually away into diſtance, and all
was again ſtill; they ſeemed to have ſunk
among the woods, whoſe tufted tops were
viſible upon the clear horizon, while every
other feature of the ſcene was involved in
the night-ſhade, which, however, allowed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0247300304:41"/>
the eye an indiſtinct view of ſome objects in
the garden below.</p>
            <p>As Emily leaned on the window, gazing
with a kind of thrilling awe upon the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
beneath, and then upon the cloudleſs
arch above, enlightened only by the ſtars,
Dorothée, in a low voice, reſumed her nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
            <p>"I was ſaying, ma'amſelle, that I well
remember when firſt I heard that muſic.
It was one night, ſoon after my lady's death,
that I had ſat up later than uſual, and I
don't know how it was, but I had been
thinking a great deal about my poor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
and of the ſad ſcene I had lately wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed.
The chateau was quite ſtill, and
I was in a chamber at a good diſtance from
the reſt-of the ſervants, and this, with the
mournful things I had been thinking of,
I ſuppoſe, made me low ſpirited, for I felt
very lonely and forlorn, as it were, and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
often, wishing to hear a ſound in the
chateau, for you know, ma'amſelle, when
one can hear people moving, one does not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0247300304:42"/>
ſo much mind, about, one's fears. But all
the ſervants were gone to bed, and I ſat,
thinking and thinking, till I was almoſt
afraid to look round the room, and my
poor lady's countenance often came to my
mind, ſuch as I had ſeen her when ſhe was
dying, and, once or twice, I almoſt thought
I ſaw her before me,—when ſuddenly I
heard ſuch ſweet moſic! It ſeemed juſt at
my window, and I ſhall never forget what
I felt. I had not power to move from my
chair, but then, when I thought it was my
dear lady's voice, the tears came to my
eyes. I had often heard her ſing, in her
life-time, and to be ſure ſhe had a very fine
voice; it had made me cry to hear her,
many a time, when ſhe has ſat in her oriel,
of an evening, playing upon her lute ſuch
ſad ſongs, and ſinging ſo. O! it went to
one's heart! I. have liſtened in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
for the hour together, and ſhe
would ſometimes ſit playing, with the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
open, when it was ſummer time, till
it was quite dark, and when I have gone
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0247300304:43"/>
in, to ſhut it, ſhe has hardly ſeemed to know
what hour it was. But, as I ſaid, madam,
continued Dorothée, "when firſt I heard
the muſic, that came juſt now, I thought
it was my late lady's, and I have often
thought ſo again, when I have heard it, as
I have done at intervals, ever ſince. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
many months have gone by, but
ſtill it has returned."</p>
            <p>"It is extraordinary," obſerved Emily,
"that no perſon has yet diſcovered the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician."</p>
            <p>"Aye, ma'amſelle, if it had been any
thing earthly it would have been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long ago, but who could have courage
to follow a ſpirit, and if they had, what
good could it do?—for ſpirits, <hi>you know,</hi>
ma'am, can take any ſhape, or no ſhape,
and they will be here, one minute, and, the
next perhaps, in a quite different place!"</p>
            <p>"Pray reſume your ſtory of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,"
ſaid Emily, "and acquaint me
with the manner of her death."</p>
            <p>"I will, ma'am," ſaid Dorothée, "but
ſhall we leave the window?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0247300304:44"/>
"This cool air refreſhes me," replied
Emily, "and I love to hear it creep along
the woods, and to look upon this duſky
landſcape. You was ſpeaking of my lord,
the Marquis, when the muſic interrupted
us."</p>
            <p>"Yes, madam, my lord, the Marquis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more and more gloomy; and my lady
grew worſe and worſe, till, one night, ſhe was
taken very ill, indeed. I was called up, and,
when I came to her bed-ſide, I was ſhocked
to ſee her countenance—it was ſo changed!
She looked piteouſly up at me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
I would call the Marquis again, for
he was not yet come, and tell him ſhe had
ſomething particular to ſay to him. At laſt,
he came, and he did, to be ſure, ſeem very
ſorry to ſee her, but he ſaid very little. My
lady told him ſhe felt herſelf to be dying,
and wiſhed to ſpeak with him alone, and
then I left the room, but I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his look as I went."</p>
            <p>"When I returned, I ventured to remind
my lord about ſending for a doctor, for I
fuppoſed he had forgot to do ſo, in his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0247300304:45"/>
grief; but my lady ſaid it was then too
late; but my lord, ſo far from thinking ſo,
ſeemed to think lightly of her diſorder—till
ſhe was ſeized with ſuch terrible pains!
O, I never ſhall forget her ſhriek! My lord
then ſent off a man and horſe for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and walked about the room and all
over the chateau, in the greateſt diſtreſs;
and I ſtaid by my dear lady, and did what
I could to eaſe her ſufferings. She had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of eaſe, and in one of theſe ſhe ſent
for my lord again; when he came, I was
going, but ſhe deſired I would not leave
her. O! I ſhall never forget what a ſcene
paſſed—I can hardly bear to think of it
now! My lord was almoſt diſtracted, for
my lady behaved with ſo much goodneſs,
and took ſuch pains to comfort him, that,
if he ever had ſuffered a ſuſpicion to enter his
head, he muſt now have been convinced he
was wrong. And to be ſure he did ſeem
to be overwhelmed with the thought of his
treatment of her, and this affected her ſo
much, that ſhe fainted away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0247300304:46"/>
"We then got my lord out of the room;
he went into his library, and threw himſelf
on the floor, and there he ſtaid, and would
hear no reaſon, that was talked to him.
When my lady recovered, ſhe enquired for
him, but, afterwards, ſaid ſhe could not bear
to ſee his grief, and deſired we would let her
die quietly. She died in my arms, ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,
and ſhe went off as peacefully as a
child, for all the violence of her diſorder
was paſſed."</p>
            <p>Dorothée pauſed, and wept, and Emily
wept with her; for ſhe was much affected
by the goodneſs of the late Marchioneſs,
and by the meek patience, with which ſhe
had ſuffered.</p>
            <p>"When the doctor came," reſumed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée,
"alas! he came too late; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
greatly ſhocked to ſee her, for ſoon
after her death a frightful blackneſs ſpread
all over her face. When he had ſent the
attendants out of the room, he aſked me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
odd queſtions about the Marchioneſs,
particularly concerning the manner, in
which ſhe had been ſeized, and he often
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0247300304:47"/>
ſhook his head at my anſwers, and ſeemed
to mean more, than he choſe to ſay. But
I underſtood him too well. However, I
kept my remarks to myſelf, and only told
them to my huſband, who bade me hold
my tongue. Some of the other ſervants,
however, ſuſpected what I did, and ſtrange
reports were whiſpered about the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
but nobody dared to make any
ſtir about them. When my lord heard that
my lady was dead, he ſhut himſelf up, and
would ſee nobody but the doctor, who
uſed to be with him alone, ſometimes for an
hour together; and, after that, the doctor
never talked with me again about my lady.
When ſhe was buried in the church of the
convent, at a little diſtance yonder, if the
moon was up you might ſee the towers
here, ma'amſelle, all my lord's vaſſals fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the funeral, and there was not a dry
eye among them, for ſhe had done a deal
of good among the poor. My lord, the
Marquis, I never ſaw any body ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
as he was aſterwards, and ſometimes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0247300304:48"/>
he would be in ſuch fits of violence, that
we almoſt thought he had loft his ſenſes.
He did not ſtay long at the chateau, but
joined his regiment, and, ſoon after, all the
ſervants, except my huſband and I, received
notice to go, for my lord went to the wars.
I never ſaw him after, for he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the chateau, though it is ſuch a fine
place, and never finiſhed thoſe fine rooms
he was building on the weſt ſide of it, and
it has, in a manner, been ſhut up ever ſince,
till my lord the Count came here."</p>
            <p>"The death of the Marchioneſs appears
extraordinary," ſaid Emily, who was anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
to know more than ſhe dared to aſk.</p>
            <p>"Yes, madam," replied Dorothée, "it
was extraordinary; I have told you all I
ſaw, and you may eaſily gueſs what I think.
I cannot ſay more, becauſe I would not
ſpread reports, that might offend my lord
the Count."</p>
            <p>"You are very right," ſaid Emily;—"where
did the Marquis die?"—" In the
north of France, I believe, ma'amſelle," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0247300304:49"/>
Dorothée. "I was very glad, when I
heard my lord the Count was coming, for
this had been a ſad deſolate place, theſe
many years, and we heard ſuch ſtrange
noiſes, ſometimes, after my lady's death,
that, as I told you before, my huſband and
I left it for a neighbouring cottage. And
now, lady, I have told you all this ſad hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and all my thoughts, and you have
promiſed, you know, never to give the leaſt
hint about it."—"I have," ſaid Emily,
"and I will be faithful to my promiſe,
Dorothée;—what you have told has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted
me more than you can imagine. I
only wiſh I could prevail upon you to tell
the name of the chevalier, whom you
thought ſo deſerving of the Marchioneſs."</p>
            <p>Dorothée, however, ſteadily refuſed to
do this, and then returned to the notice of
Emily's likeneſs to the late Marchioneſs.
"There is another picture of her," added
ſhe," hanging in a room of the ſuite, which
was ſhut up. It was drawn, as I have
heard, before ſhe was married, and is much
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0247300304:50"/>
more like you than the miniature." When
Emily expreſſed a ſtrong deſire to ſee this,
Dorothée replied, that ſhe did not like to
open thoſe rooms; but Emily reminded
her, that the Count had talked the other
day of ordering them to be opened; of
which Dorothée ſeemed to conſider much,
and then ſhe owned, that ſhe ſhould feel
leſs, if ſhe went into them with Emily firſt,
than otherwiſe, and at length promiſed to
ſhew the picture.</p>
            <p>The night was too far advanced and
Emily was too much affected by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of the ſcenes, which had paſſed in
thoſe apartments, to wiſh to viſit them at
this hour, but ſhe requeſted that Dorothée
would return on the following night, when
they were not likely to be obſerved, and
conduct her thither. Beſides her wiſh to
examine the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> portrait, ſhe felt a thrilling
curioſity to ſee the chamber, in which
the Marchioneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had died, and which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée
had ſaid remained, with the bed
and furniture, juſt as when the corpſe was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0247300304:51"/>
removed for interment. The ſolemn emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which the expectation of viewing
ſuch a ſcene had awakened, were in uniſon
with the preſent tone of her mind, depreſſed
by ſevere diſappointment. Cheerful objects
rather added to, than removed this depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but, perhaps, ſhe yielded too much to
her melancholy inclination, and imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lamented the misfortune, which no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of her own could have taught her to
avoid, though no effort of reaſon could
make her look unmoved upon the ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation
of him, whom ſhe had once eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed
and loved.</p>
            <p>Dorothée promiſed to return, on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
night, with the keys of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and then wiſhed Emily good repoſe,
and departed. Emily, however, continued
at the window, muſing upon the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
fate of the Marchioneſs and liſtening,
in awful expectation, for a return of the
muſic. But the ſtillneſs of the night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
long unbroken, except by the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
ſounds of the woods, as they wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0247300304:52"/>
in the breeze, and then by the diſtant
bell of the convent, linking one. She now
withdrew from the window, and, as ſhe
ſat at her bed-ſide, indulging melancholy
reveries, which the lonelineſs of the hour
aſſiſted, the ſtillneſs was ſuddenly interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not by muſic, but by very uncommon
ſounds, that ſeemed to come either from the
room, adjoining her own, or from one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
The terrible cataſtrophe, that had been
related to her, together with the myſterious
circumſtances, ſaid to have ſince occurred
in the chateau, had ſo much ſhocked her
ſpirits, that ſhe now ſunk, for a moment,
under the weakneſs of ſuperſtition. The
ſounds, however, did not return, and ſhe
retired, to forget in ſleep the diſaſtrous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſhe had heard.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>ON the next night, about the ſame hour
as before, Dorothée came to Emily's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
with the keys of that ſuite of rooms,
which had been particularly appropriated
to the late Marchioneſs. Theſe extended
along the north ſide of the chateau, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of the old building; and, as
Emily's room was in the ſouth, they had to
paſs over a great extent of the caſtle, and by
the chambers of ſeveral of the family, whoſe
obſervations Dorothée was anxious to avoid,
ſince it might excite enquiry and raiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
ſuch as would diſpleaſe the Count.
She, therefore, requeſted, that Emily would
wait half an hour, before they ventured
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0247300304:54"/>
forth, that they might be certain all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were gone to bed. It was nearly one,
before the chateau was perfectly ſtill, or
Dorothée thought it prudent to leave the
chamber. In this interval, her ſpirits ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be greatly affected by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of paſt events, and by the proſpect
of entering again upon places, where theſe
had occurred, and in which ſhe had not
been for ſo many years. Emily too was
affected, but her feelings had more of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
and leſs of fear. From the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
into which reflection and expectation
had thrown them, they, at length, rouſed
themſelves, and left the chamber. Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thée,
at firſt, carried the lamp, but her hand
trembled ſo much with infirmity and alarm,
that Emily took it from her, and offered
her arm, to ſupport her feeble ſteps.</p>
            <p>They had to deſcend the great ſtair-caſe,
and, after paſſing over a wide extent of the
chateau, to aſcend another, which led to the
ſuite of rooms they were in queſt of. They
ſtepped cautiouſly along the open corridor,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0247300304:55"/>
that ran round the great hall, and into
which the chambers of the Count, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs,
and the lady Blanch, opened, and, from
thence, deſcending the chief ſtair-caſe, they
croſſed the hall itſelf. Proceeding through
the ſervants hall, where the dying embers
of a wood fire ſtill glimmered on the
hearth, and the ſupper table was ſurrounded
by chairs, that obſtructed their paſſage,
they came to the foot of the back ſtair-caſe.
Old Dorothée here pauſed, and looked
around; "Let us liſten," ſaid ſhe, "if any
thing is ſtirring; Ma'amſelle, do you hear
any voice?" "None," ſaid Emily, "there
certainly is no perſon up in the chateau,
beſides ourſelves."—"No, ma'amſelle," ſaid
Dorothée "but I have never been here at
this hour before, and, after what I know, my
fears are not wonderful."—"What do
you know?" ſaid Emily.—"O ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,
we have no time for talking now; let
us go on. That door on the left is the one
we muſt open."</p>
            <p>They proceeded, and, having reached the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0247300304:56"/>
top of the ſtair-caſe, Dorothée. applied the
key to the lock. "Ah," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe
endeavoured to turn it, "ſo many years
have paſſed ſince this was opened, that I fear
it will not move." Emily was more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and they preſently entered a ſpacious
and ancient chamber.</p>
            <p>"Alas! exclaimed Dorothée, as ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
"the laſt time I paſſed through this
door—I followed my poor lady's corpſe!"</p>
            <p>Emily, ſtruck with the circumſtance, and
affected by the duſky and ſolemn air of
the apartment, remained ſilent, and they
paſſed on through a long ſuite of rooms, till
they came to one more ſpacious than the
reſt, and rich in the remains of faded magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
            <p>"Let us reſt here awhile, madam," ſaid
Dorothée faintly, "we are going into the
chamber, where my lady died! that door
opens into it. Ah, ma'amſelle! why did
you perſuade me to come?"</p>
            <p>Emily drew one of the maſſy arm-chairs,
with which the apartment was furniſhed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0247300304:57"/>
and begged Dorothée would ſit down, and
try to compoſe her ſpirits.</p>
            <p>"How the ſight of this place brings all
that paſſed formerly to my mind!" ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée;
"it ſeems as if it was but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
ſince all that ſad affair happened!"</p>
            <p>"Hark! what noiſe is that?" ſaid
Emily.</p>
            <p>Dorothée, half ſtarting from her chair,
looked round the apartment, and they liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened—but,
every thing remaining ſtill, the
old woman ſpoke again upon the ſubject of
her ſorrow. "This ſaloon, ma'amſelle,
was in my lady's time the fineſt apartment
in the chateau, and it was fitted up accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her own taſte. All this grand furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but you can now hardly ſee what it is
for the duſt, and our light is none of the
bed—ah! how I have ſeen this room lighted
up in my lady's time!—all this grand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
came from Paris, and was made after
the fashion of ſome in the Louvre there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thoſe large glaſſes, and they came from
ſome outlandiſh place, and that rich tapeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0247300304:58"/>
How the colours are faded already!—ſince
I ſaw it laſt!"</p>
            <p>"I underſtood, that was twenty years
ago," obſerved Emily.</p>
            <p>"Thereabout, madam," ſaid Dorothée,
"and well remembered, but all the time
between then and now ſeems as nothing.
That tapeſtry uſed to be greatly admired at,
it tells the ſtories out of ſome famous book,
or other, but I have forgot the name."</p>
            <p>Emily now roſe to examine the figures it
exhibited, and diſcovered, by verſes in the
Provençal tongue, wrought underneath each
ſcene, that it exhibited ſtories from ſome of
the moſt celebrated ancient romances.</p>
            <p>Dorothée's ſpirits being now more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
ſhe roſe, and unlocked the door that
led into the late Marchioneſs's apartment,
and Emily paſſed into a lofty chamber,
hung round with dark arras, and ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
that the lamp ſhe held up did not ſhew
its extent; while Dorothée, when ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
had dropped into a chair, where,
ſighing deeply, ſhe ſcarcely truſted herſelf
with the view of a ſcene ſo affecting to her.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0247300304:59"/>
It was ſome time before Emily perceived,
through the duſk, the bed on which the
Marchioneſs was ſaid to have died; when,
advancing to the upper end of the room,
ſhe diſcovered the high canopied teſter of
dark green damaſk, with the curtains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to the floor in the faſhion of a
tent, half drawn, and remaining apparently,
as they had been left twenty years before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and over the whole bedding was thrown a
counterpane, or pall, of black velvet, that
hung down to the floor. Emily ſhuddered,
as ſhe held the lamp over it, and looked
within the dark curtains, where ſhe almoſt
expected to have ſeen a human face, and,
ſuddenly remembering the horror ſhe had
ſuffered upon diſcovering the dying Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Montoni in the turret-chamber of
Udolpho, her ſpirits fainted, and ſhe was
turning from the bed, when Dorothée, who
had now reached it, exclaimed, "Holy
Virgin! methinks I ſee my lady ſtretched
upon that pall—as when laſt I ſaw hen!"</p>
            <p>Emily, ſhocked by this exclamation,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0247300304:60"/>
looked involuntarily again within the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
but the blackneſs of the pall only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared;
while Dorothée was compelled to
ſupport herſelf upon the ſide of the bed,
and preſently tears brought her ſome relief.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" ſaid ſhe, after ſhe had wept
awhile, "it was here I ſat on that terrible
night, and held my lady's hand, and heard
her laſt words, and ſaw all her ſufferings—<hi>here</hi>
ſhe died in my arms!"</p>
            <p>"Do not indulge theſe painful recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,"
ſaid Emily, "let us go. Shew me
the picture you mentioned, if it will not
too much affect you."</p>
            <p>"It hangs in the oriel," ſaid Dorothée
riſing, and going towards a ſmall door near
the bed's head, which ſhe opened, and
Emily followed with the light, into the
cloſet of the late Marchioneſs.</p>
            <p>"Alas! there ſhe is, ma'amſelle," ſaid
Dorothée, pointing to a portrait of a lady,
"there is her very ſelf! juſt as ſhe looked
when ſhe came firſt to the chateau. You
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0247300304:61"/>
ſee, madam, ſhe was all blooming like you,
then—and ſo ſoon to be cut off!"</p>
            <p>While Dorothée ſpoke, Emily was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
examining the picture, which
bore a ſtrong reſemblance to the miniature,
though the expreſſion of the countenance
in each was ſomewhat different; but ſtill
ſhe thought ſhe perceived ſomething of
that penſive melancholy in the portrait,
which ſo ſtrongly characteriſed the minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>"Pray, ma'amſelle, ſtand beſide the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that I may look at you together,"
ſaid Dorothée, who, when the requeſt was
complied with, exclaimed again at the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.
Emily alſo, as ſhe gazed upon it,
thought that ſhe had ſomewhere ſeen a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
very like it, though ſhe could not now
recollect who this was.</p>
            <p>In this cloſet were many memorials of
the departed Marchioneſs; a robe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
articles of her dreſs were ſcattered
upon the chairs, as if they had juſt been
thrown off. On the floor, were a pair of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0247300304:62"/>
black ſattin ſlippers, and, on the dreſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
a pair of gloves and a long black
veil, which, as Emily took it up to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
ſhe perceived was dropping to pieces
with age.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" ſaid Dorothée, obſerving the
veil, "my lady's hand laid it there; it has
never been moved ſince!"</p>
            <p>Emily, ſhuddering, immediately laid it
down again. "I well remember ſeeing
her take it off," continued Dorothée, "it
was on the night before her death, when ſhe
had returned from a little walk I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
her to take in the gardens, and ſhe
ſeemed, refreſhed by it. I told her how
much better ſhe looked, and I remember
what a languid ſmile ſhe gave me; but,
alas! ſhe little thought, or I either, that
ſhe was to die, that night."</p>
            <p>Dorothée wept again, and then, taking
up the veil, threw it ſuddenly over Emily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who ſhuddered to find it wrapped round
her, deſcending even to her feet, and, as ſhe
endeavoured to throw it off, Dorothée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0247300304:63"/>
that ſhe would keep it on for one
moment. "I thought," added ſhe, "how
like you would look to my dear miſtreſs in
that veil;—may your life, ma'amſelle, be
a happier one than hers!"</p>
            <p>Emily, having diſengaged herſelf from
the veil, laid it again on the dreſſing-table,
and ſurveyed the cloſet, where every object,
on which her eye fixed, ſeemed to ſpeak of
the Marchioneſs. In a large oriel window
of painted glaſs, ſtood a table, with a ſilver
crucifix, and a prayer-book open; and
Emily remembered with emotion what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée
had mentioned concerning her cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn
of playing on her lute in this window,
before ſhe obſerved the lute itſelf, lying on
a corner of the table, as if it had been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly
placed there by the hand, that had ſo
often awakened it.</p>
            <p>"This is a ſad forlorn place!" ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée,
"for, when my dear lady died, I had
no heart to put it to rights, or the chamber
either; and my lord never came into the
rooms after, ſo they remain juſt as they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0247300304:64"/>
did when my lady was removed for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
            <p>While Dorothée ſpoke, Emily was ſtill
looking on the lute, which was a Spaniſh
one, and remarkably large; and then, with
a heſitating hand, ſhe took it up, and paſſed
her fingers over the chords. They were
out of tune, but uttered a deep and full
ſound. Dorothée ſtarted at their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
tones, and, ſeeing the lute in Emily's
hand, ſaid, "This is the lute my lady
Marchioneſs loved ſo! I remember when
laſt she played upon it—it was on the night
that ſhe died. I came as uſual to undreſs
her, and, as I entered the bed-chamber, I
heard the ſound of muſic from the oriel,
and perceiving it was my lady's, who was
ſitting there, I ſtepped ſoftly to the door,
which ſtood a little open, to liſten; for the
muſic—though it was mournful—was ſo
ſweet! There I ſaw her, with the lute in
her hand, looking upwards, and the tears
fell upon her cheeks, while ſhe ſung a veſper
hymn, ſo ſoft, and ſo ſolemn! and her voice
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0247300304:65"/>
trembled, as it were, and then ſhe would
ſtop for a moment, and wipe away her
tears, and go on again, lower than before.
O! I had often liſtened to my lady, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard any thing ſo ſweet as this; it
made me cry, almoſt, to hear it. She had
been at prayers, I fancy, for there was the
book open on the table beſide her—aye,
and there it lies open ſtill! Pray, let us
leave the oriel, ma'amſelle," added Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée,
"this is a heart-breaking place!"</p>
            <p>Having returned into the chamber, ſhe
deſired to look once more upon the bed,
when, as they came oppoſite to the open
door, leading into the ſaloon, Emily, in the
partial gleam, which the lamp threw into
it, thought ſhe ſaw ſomething glide along
into the obſcurer part of the room. Her
ſpirits had been much affected by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
ſcene, or it is probable this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
whether real or imaginary, would
not have affected her in the degree it did;
but ſhe endeavoured to conceal her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Dorothée, who, however, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0247300304:66"/>
her countenance change, enquired if ſhe
was ill.</p>
            <p>"Let us go," ſaid Emily, faintly, "the
air of theſe rooms is unwholeſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" but,
when ſhe attempted to do ſo, conſidering
that ſhe muſt paſs through the apartment
where the phantom of her terror had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
this terror increaſed, and, too faint
to ſupport herſelf, ſhe ſat down on the ſide
of the bed.</p>
            <p>Dorothée, believing that ſhe was only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by a conſideration of the melancholy
cataſtrophe, which had happened on this
ſpot, endeavoured to cheer her; and then,
as they ſat together on the bed, ſhe began
to relate other particulars concerning it,
and this without reflecting, that it might
increaſe Emily's emotion, but becauſe they
were particularly intereſting to herſelf. "A
little before my lady's death," ſaid ſhe,
"when the pains were gone off, ſhe called
me to her, and, ſtretching out her hand to
me, I ſat down juſt there—where the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
falls upon the bed. How well I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0247300304:67"/>
her look at the time—death was in
it!—I can almoſt fancy I ſee her now.—There
ſhe lay, ma'amſelle—her face was
upon the pillow there! This black coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpane
was not upon the bed then; it was
laid on, after her death, and ſhe was laid
out upon it."</p>
            <p>Emily turned to look within the duſky
curtains, as if ſhe could have ſeen the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of which Dorothée ſpoke. The
edge of the white pillow only appeared
above the blackneſs of the pall, but, as her
eyes wandered over the pall itſelf, ſhe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
ſhe ſaw it move. Without ſpeaking,
ſhe caught Dorothée's arm, who, ſurpriſed
by the action, and by the look of terror that
accompanied it, turned her eyes from Emily
to the bed, where, in the next moment ſhe,
too, ſaw the pall ſlowly lifted, and fall
again.</p>
            <p>Emily attempted to go, but Dorothée
ſtood fixed and gazing upon the bed; and,
at length, ſaid—"It is only the wind, that
waves it, ma'amſelle; we have left all the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0247300304:68"/>
doors open: ſee how the air waves the
lamp, too.—It is only the wind."</p>
            <p>She had ſcarcely uttered theſe words,
when the pall was more violently agitated
than before; but Emily, ſomewhat aſhamed
of her terrors, ſtepped back to the bed,
willing to be convinced that the wind only
had occaſioned her alarm; when, as ſhe
gazed within the curtains, the pall moved
again, and, in the next moment, the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
of a human countenance roſe above
it.</p>
            <p>Screaming with terror, they both fled,
and got out of the chamber as faſt as their
trembling limbs would bear them, leaving
open the doors of all the rooms, through
which they paſſed. When they reached
the ſtair-caſe, Dorothée threw open a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door,
where ſome of the female ſervants
ſlept, and ſunk breathleſs on the bed;
while Emily, deprived of all preſence of
mind, made only a feeble attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the occaſion of her terror from the
aſtoniſhed ſervants; and, though Dorothée,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0247300304:69"/>
when ſhe could ſpeak, endeavoured to laugh
at her own fright, and was joined by Emily,
no remonſtrances could prevail with the
ſervants, who had quickly taken the alarm,
to paſs even the remainder of the night in a
room ſo near to theſe terrific chambers.</p>
            <p>Dorothée having accompanied Emily to
her own apartment, they then began to talk
over, with ſome degree of coolneſs, the
ſtrange circumſtance, that had juſt occurred;
and Emily would almoſt have doubted her
own perceptions, had not thoſe of Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thée
atteſted their truth. Having now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
what ſhe had obſerved in the outer
chamber, ſhe aſked the houſekeeper, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe was certain no door had been left
unfaſtened, by which a perſon might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
have entered the apartments? Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thée
replied, that ſhe had conſtantly kept
the keys of the ſeveral doors in her own
poſſeſſion; that, when ſhe had gone her
rounds through the caſtle, as ſhe frequently
did, to examine if all was ſafe, ſhe had
tried theſe doors among the reſt, and had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0247300304:70"/>
always found them faſtened. It was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
impoſſible, ſhe added, that any perſon
could have got admittance into the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and, if they could—it was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
they ſhould have choſe to ſleep in
a place ſo cold and forlorn.</p>
            <p>Emily obſerved, that their viſit to theſe
chambers had, perhaps, been watched, and
that ſome perſon, for a frolic, had followed
them into the rooms, with a deſign to
frighten them, and, while they were in the
oriel, had taken the opportunity of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf in the bed.</p>
            <p>Dorothée allowed, that this was poſſible,
till ſhe recollected, that, on entering the
apartments, ſhe had turned the key of the
outer door, and this, which had been done
to prevent their viſit being noticed by any
of the family, who might happen to be up,
muſt effectually have excluded every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
except themſelves, from the chambers;
and ſhe now perſiſted in affirming, that the
ghaſtly countenance ſhe had ſeen was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0247300304:71"/>
human, but ſome dreadful appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition.</p>
            <p>Emily was very ſolemnly affected. Of
whatever nature might be the appearance
ſhe had witneſſed, whether human or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
the fate of the deceaſed Marchioneſs
was a truth not to be doubted; and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
circumſtance, occurring in the
very ſcene of her ſufferings, affected Emily's
imagination with a ſuperſtitious awe, to
which, after having detected the fallacies at
Udolpho, ſhe might not have yielded, had
ſhe been ignorant of the unhappy ſtory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the houſekeeper. Her ſhe now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
conjured to conceal the occurrence
of this night, and to make light of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
ſhe had already betrayed, that the Count
might not be diſtreſſed by reports, which
would certainly ſpread alarm and confuſion
among his family. "Time," ſhe added,
"may explain this myſterious affair; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
let us watch the event in ſilence."</p>
            <p>Dorothée readily acquieſced; but ſhe
now recollected that ſhe had left all the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0247300304:72"/>
doors of the north ſuite of rooms open, and,
not having courage to return alone to lock
even the outer one, Emily, after ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
ſo far conquered her own fears, that
ſhe offered to accompany her to the foot of
the back ſtair-caſe, and to wait there while
Dorothée aſcended, whoſe reſolution being
re-aſſured by this circumſtance, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to go, and they left Emily's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
together.</p>
            <p>No ſound diſturbed the ſtillneſs, as they
paſſed along the halls and galleries; but,
on reaching the foot of the back ſtair-caſe,
Dorothée's reſolution failed again; having,
however, pauſed a moment to liſten, and no
ſound being heard above, ſhe aſcended,
leaving Emily below, and, ſcarcely ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her eye to glance within the firſt cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
ſhe faſtened the door, which ſhut up
the whole ſuite of apartments, and returned
to Emily.</p>
            <p>As they ſtepped along the paſſage, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the great hall, a ſound of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was heard, which ſeemed to come from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0247300304:73"/>
the hall itſelf, and they ſtopped in new
alarm to liſten, when Emily preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
the voice of Annette, whom ſhe
found croſſing the hall, with another female
ſervant, and ſo terrified by the report, which
the other maids had ſpread, that, believing
ſhe could be ſafe only where her lady was,
ſhe was going for refuge to her apartment.
Emily's endeavours to laugh, or to argue
her out of theſe terrors, were equally vain,
and, in compaſſion to her diſtreſs, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
that ſhe ſhould remain in her room
during the night.</p>

            <p>EMILY's injunctions to Annette to be ſilent
on the ſubject of her terror were ineffectual,
and the occurrence of the preceding night
ſpread ſuch alarm among the ſervants, who
now all affirmed, that they had frequently
heard unaccountable noiſes in the chateau,
that a report ſoon reached the Count of the
north ſide of the caſtle being haunted. He
treated this, at firſt, with ridicule, but, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that it was productive of ſerious
evil, in the confuſion it occaſioned among
his household, he forbade any perſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it, on pain of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0247300304:75"/>
The arrival of a party of his friends ſoon
withdrew his thoughts entirely from this
ſubject, and his ſervants had now little lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to brood over it, except, indeed, in the
evenings after ſupper, when they all aſſembled
in their hall, and related ſtories of ghoſts,
till they feared to took round the room;
ſtarted, if the echo of a cloſing door mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
along the paſſage, and refuſed to go
ſingly to any part of the caſtle.</p>
            <p>On theſe occaſions Annette made a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
figure. When ſhe told not only of
all the wonders ſhe had witneſſed, but of all
that ſhe had imagined, in the caſtle of Udol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,
with the ſtory of the ſtrange diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Signora Laurentini, ſhe made no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
impreſſion on the mind of her attentive
auditors. Her ſuſpicions, concerning Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni,
ſhe would alſo have freely diſcloſed,
had not Ludovico, who was now in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Count, prudently checked her
loquacity, whenever it pointed to that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Among the viſitors at the chateau was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0247300304:76"/>
the Baron de Saint Foix, an old friend of
the Count, and his ſon, the Chevalier St.
Foix, a ſenſible and amiable young man,
who, having in the preceding year ſeen the
Lady Blanche, at Paris, had become her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
admirer. The friendſhip, which the
Count had long entertained for his father,
and the equality of their circumſtances made
him ſecretly approve of the connection; but,
thinking his daughter at this time too young
to fix her choice for life, and wiſhing to prove
the ſincerity and ſtrength of the Chevalier's
attachment, he then rejected his ſuit, though
without forbidding his future hope. This
young man now came, with the Baron, his
father, to claim the reward of a ſteady affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a claim, which the Count admitted and
which Blanche did not reject.</p>
            <p>While theſe viſitors were at the chateau, it
became a ſcene of gaiety and ſplendour. The
pavilion in the woods was fitted up and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented,
in the fine evenings, as a ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
when the hour uſually concluded with
a concert, at which the Count and Counteſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0247300304:77"/>
who were ſcientific performers, and the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
Henri and St. Foix, with the Lady
Blanche and Emily, whoſe voices and fine
taſte compenſated for the want of more ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
execution, uſually aſſiſted. Several of the
Count's ſervants performed on horns and
other inſtruments, ſome of which, placed at
a little diſtance among the woods, ſpoke, in
ſweet reſponſe, to the harmony, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the pavilion.</p>
            <p>At any other period, theſe parties would
have been delightful to Emily; but her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were now oppreſſed with a melancholy,
which ſhe perceived that no kind of what is
called amuſement had power to diſſipate,
and which the tender and, frequently, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic,
melody of theſe concerts ſometimes
increaſed to a very painful degree.</p>
            <p>She was particularly fond of walking in
the woods, that hung on a promontory,
overlooking the ſea. Their luxuriant ſhade
was ſoothing to her penſive mind, and, in
the partial views, which they afforded of the
Mediterranean, with its winding ſhores and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0247300304:78"/>
paſſing ſails, tranquil beauty was united
with grandeur. The paths were rude and
frequently overgrown with vegetation, but
their taſteful owner would ſuffer little to be
done to them, and ſcarcely a ſingle branch
to be lopped from the venerable trees. On
an eminence, in one of the moſt ſequeſtered
parts of theſe woods, was a ruſtic ſeat,
formed of the trunk of a decayed oak, which
had once been a noble tree, and of which
many lofty branches ſtill flouriſhing united
with beech and pines to over-canopy the
ſpot. Beneath their deep umbrage, the eye
paſſed over the tops of other woods, to the
Mediterranean, and, to the left, through an
opening, was ſeen a ruined watch-tower,
ſtanding on a point of rock, near the ſea,
and riſing from among the tufted foliage.</p>
            <p>Hither Emily often came alone in the
ſilence of evening, and, ſoothed by the
ſcenery and by the faint murmur, that roſe
from the waves, would ſit, till darkneſs
obliged her to return to the chateau. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
alſo, ſhe viſited the watch-tower,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0247300304:79"/>
which commanded the entire proſpect, and,
when ſhe leaned againſt its broken walls,
and thought of Valancourt, ſhe not once
imagined, what was ſo true, that this tower
had been almoſt as frequently his reſort, as
her own, ſince his eſtrangement from the
neighbouring chateau.</p>
            <p>One evening, ſhe lingered here to a late
hour. She had ſat on the ſteps of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
watching, in tranquil melancholy, the
gradual effect of evening over the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
proſpect, till the gray waters of the
Mediterranean and the maſſy woods were
almoſt the only features of the ſcene, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
viſible; when, as ſhe gazed alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
on theſe, and on the mild blue of the
heavens, where the firſt pale ſtar of evening
appeared, ſhe perſonified the hour in the
following lines:—</p>

            <p>The moon was now riſing out of the
ſea. She watched its gradual progreſs, the
extending line of radiance it threw upon
the waters, the ſparkling oars, the ſail faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſilvered, and the wood-tops and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements
of the watch-tower, at whoſe foot
ſhe was ſitting, juſt tinted with the rays.
Emily's ſpirits were in harmony with this
ſcene. As ſhe ſat meditating, ſounds ſtole
by her on the air, which ſhe immediately
knew to be the muſic and the voice ſhe
had formerly heard at midnight, and the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0247300304:82"/>
emotion of awe, which ſhe felt, was not
unmixed with terror, when ſhe conſidered
her remote and lonely ſituation. The
ſounds drew nearer. She would have riſen
to leave the place, but they ſeemed to come
from the way ſhe muſt have taken towards
the chateau, and ſhe awaited the event in
trembling expectation. The ſounds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to approach, for ſome time, and
then ceaſed. Emily ſat liſtening, gazing
and unable to move, when ſhe ſaw a figure
emerge from the ſhade of the woods and
paſs along the bank, at ſome little diſtance
before her. It went ſwiftly, and her ſpirits
were ſo overcome with awe, that, though
ſhe ſaw, ſhe did not much obſerve it.</p>
            <p>Having left the ſpot, with a reſolution
never again to viſit it alone, at ſo late an
hour, ſhe began to approach the chateau,
when ſhe heard voices calling her from the
part of the wood, which was neareſt to it.
They were the ſhouts of the Count's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who were ſent to ſearch for her; and
when ſhe entered the ſupper-room, where
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0247300304:83"/>
he ſat with Henri and Blanche, he gently
reproached her with a look, which ſhe
bluſhed to have deſerved.</p>
            <p>This little occurrence deeply impreſſed
her mind, and, when ſhe withdrew to her
own room, it recalled ſo forcibly the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
ſhe had witneſſed, a few nights
before, that ſhe had ſcarcely courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
alone. She watched to a late hour,
when, no ſound having renewed her fears,
ſhe, at length, ſunk to repoſe. But this
was of ſhort continuance, for ſhe was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
by a loud and unuſual noiſe, that
ſeemed to come from the gallery, into
which her chamber opened. Groans were
diſtinctly heard, and, immediately after, a
dead weight fell againſt her door, with a
violence, that threatened to burſt it open.
She called loudly to know who was there,
but received no anſwer, though, at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
ſhe ſtill thought ſhe heard ſomething
like a low moaning. Fear deprived her of
the power to move. Soon after, ſhe heard
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0247300304:84"/>
footſteps in a remote part of the gallery,
and, as they approached, ſhe called more
loudly than before, till the ſteps pauſed at
her door. She then diſtinguiſhed the voices
of ſeveral of the ſervants, who ſeemed too
much engaged by ſome circumſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
to attend to her calls; but, Annette
ſoon after entering the room for water,
Emily underſtood, that one of the maids
had fainted, whom she immediately deſired
them to bring into her room, where ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
to reſtore her. When this girl had
recovered her ſpeech, ſhe affirmed, that, as
ſhe was paſſing up the back ſtair-caſe, in
the way to her chamber, ſhe had ſeen an
apparition on the ſecond landing-place;
ſhe held the lamp low, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe
might pick her way, ſeveral of the ſtairs
being infirm and even decayed, and it was
upon raiſing her eyes, that ſhe ſaw this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
It ſtood for a moment in the
corner of the landing-place, which ſhe was
approaching, and then, gliding up the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0247300304:85"/>
ſtairs, vaniſhed at the door of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that had been lately opened. She
heard afterwards a hollow ſound.</p>
            <p>"Then the devil has got a key to that
apartment," ſaid Dorothée, "for it could
be nobody but he; I locked the door my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!"</p>
            <p>The girl, ſpringing down the ſtairs and
paſſing up the great ſtair-caſe, had run,
with a faint ſcream, till ſhe reached the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
where ſhe fell, groaning, at Emily's
door.</p>
            <p>Gently chiding her for the alarm ſhe had
occaſioned, Emily tried to make her aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of her fears; but the girl perſiſted in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that ſhe had ſeen an apparition, till ſhe
went to her own room, whither ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by all the ſervants preſent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Dorothée, who, at Emily's requeſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
with her during the night. Emily
was perplexed, and Dorothée was terrified,
and mentioned many occurrences of former
times, which had long ſince confirmed her
ſuperſtitions; among theſe, according to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0247300304:86"/>
her belief, ſhe had once witneſſed an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
like that juſt deſcribed, and on the very
ſame ſpot, and it was the remembrance of it,
that had made her pauſe, when ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to aſcend the ſtairs with Emily, and
which had increaſed her reluctance to open
the north apartments. Whatever might be
Emily's opinions, ſhe did not diſcloſe them,
but liſtened attentively to all that Dorothée
communicated, which occaſioned her much
thought and perplexity.</p>
            <p>From this night the terror of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
increaſed to ſuch an exceſs, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them determined to leave the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
and requeſted their diſcharge of the
Count, who, if he had any faith in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their alarm, thought proper to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
it, and, anxious to avoid the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
that threatened him, employed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule
and then argument to convince them
they had nothing to apprehend from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
agency. But fear had rendered
their minds inacceſſible to reaſon; and it
was now, that Ludovico proved at once
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0247300304:87"/>
his courage and his gratitude for the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he had received from the Count, by
offering to watch, during a night, in the
ſuite of rooms, reputed to be haunted.
He feared, he ſaid, no ſpirits, and, if any
thing of human form appeared—he would
prove that he dreaded that as little.</p>
            <p>The Count pauſed upon the offer, while
the ſervants, who heard it, looked upon one
another in doubt and amazement, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette,
terrified for the ſafety of Ludovico,
employed tears and entreaties to diſſuade
him from his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>"You are a bold fellow," ſaid the
Count, ſmiling, "Think well of what you
are going to encounter, before you finally
determine upon it. However, if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
in your reſolution, I will accept your
offer, and your intrepidity ſhall not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded."</p>
            <p>"I deſire no reward, your <hi>Excellenza,</hi>"
replied Ludovico, "but your approbation.
Your <hi>Excellenza</hi> has been ſufficiently good
to me already; but I wiſh to have arms,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0247300304:88"/>
that I may be equal to my enemy, if he
ſhould appear."</p>
            <p>"Your ſword cannot defend you againſt
a ghoſt," replied the Count, throwing a
glance of irony upon the other ſervants,
"neither can bars, or bolts; for a ſpirit,
you know, can glide through a key-hole, as
eaſily as through a door."</p>
            <p>"Give me a ſword, my lord Count,"
ſaid Ludovico, "and I will lay all the
ſpirits, that ſhall attack me, in the red
ſea."</p>
            <p>"Well," ſaid the Count, "you ſhall
have a ſword, and good cheer, too; and
your brave comrades here will, perhaps,
have courage enough to remain another
night in the chateau, ſince your boldneſs
will certainly, for this night, at leaſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
all the malice of the ſpectre to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>
            <p>Curioſity now ſtruggled with fear in the
minds of ſeveral of his fellow ſervants, and,
at length, they reſolved to await the event
of Ludovico's raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0247300304:89"/>
Emily was ſurpriſed and concerned, when
ſhe heard of his intention, and was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclined to mention what ſhe had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
in the north apartments to the Count,
for ſhe could not entirely diveſt herſelf of
fears for Ludovico's ſafety, though her
reaſon repreſented theſe to be abſurd. The
neceſſity, however, of concealing the ſecret,
with which Dorothée had entruſted her,
and which muſt have been mentioned, with
the late occurrence, in excuſe for her hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo privately viſited the north apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
kept her entirely ſilent on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of her apprehenſion; and ſhe tried on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſooth Annette, who held, that Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico
was certainly to be deſtroyed; and who
was much leſs affected by Emily's conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
efforts, than by the manner of old
Dorothée, who often, as ſhe exclaimed Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,
ſighed, and threw up her eyes to
heaven.</p>

            <p>THE Count gave orders for the north
apartments to be opened and prepared for
the reception of Ludovico; but Dorothée,
remembering what ſhe had lately witneſſed
there, feared to obey, and, not one of the
other ſervants daring to venture thither, the
rooms remained ſhut up till the time when
Ludovico was to retire thither for the night,
an hour, for which the whole houſehold
waited with impatience.</p>
            <p>After ſupper, Ludovico, by the order of
the Count, attended him in his cloſet, where
they remained alone for near half an hour,
and, on leaving which, his Lord delivered
to him a ſword.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0247300304:91"/>
"It has ſeen ſervice in mortal quarrels,"
ſaid the Count, jocoſely, "you will uſe it
honourably, no doubt, in a ſpiritual one.
To-morrow, let me hear that there is not
one ghoſt remaining in the chateau."</p>
            <p>Ludovico received it with a reſpectful
bow. "You ſhall be obeyed, my Lord,"
ſaid he; "I will engage, that no ſpectre
ſhall diſturb the peace of the chateau after
this night."</p>
            <p>They now returned to the ſupper-room,
where the Count's gueſts awaited to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him and Ludovico to the door of the
north apartments, and Dorothée, being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
for the keys, delivered them to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,
who then led the way, followed by
moſt of the inhabitants of the chateau.
Having reached the back ſtair-caſe, ſeveral
of the ſervants ſhrunk back, and refuſed to
go further, but the reſt followed him to the
top of the ſtair-caſe, where a broad landing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
allowed them to flock round him,
while he applied the key to the door,
during which they watched him with as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0247300304:92"/>
much eager curioſity as if he had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
ſome magical rite.</p>
            <p>Ludovico, unaccuſtomed to the lock,
could not turn it, and Dorothée, who had
lingered far behind, was called forward,
under whoſe hand the door opened ſlowly,
and, her eye glancing within the duſky
chamber, ſhe uttered a ſudden ſhriek, and
retreated. At this ſignal of alarm, the
greater part of the crowd hurried down the
ſtairs, and the Count, Henri and Ludovico
were left alone to purſue the enquiry, who
inſtantly ruſhed into the apartment, Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico
with a drawn ſword, which he had juſt
time to draw from the ſcabbard, the Count
with the lamp in his hand, and Henri car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a baſket, containing proviſion for the
courageous adventurer.</p>
            <p>Having looked haſtily round the firſt
room, where nothing appeared to juſtify
alarm, they paſſed on to the ſecond; and,
here too all being quiet, they proceeded to
a third in a more tempered ſtep. The
Count had now leiſure to ſmile at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0247300304:93"/>
into which he had been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
and to aſk Ludovico in which room
he deſigned to paſs the night.</p>
            <p>"There are ſeveral chambers beyond
theſe, your <hi>Excellenza,</hi>" ſaid Ludovico,
pointing to a door, "and in one of them is
a bed, they ſay. I will paſs the night there,
and when I am weary of watching, I can
lie down."</p>
            <p>"Good;" ſaid the Count, "let us go on.
You ſee theſe rooms ſhew nothing, but damp
walls and decaying furniture. I have been
ſo much engaged ſince I came to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
that I have not looked into them till
now. Remember, Ludovico, to tell the
houſekeeper, to-morrow, to throw open
theſe windows. The damaſk hangings are
dropping to pieces, I will have them taken
down, and this antique furniture removed."</p>
            <p>"Dear ſir!" ſaid Henri, "here is an
arm-chair ſo maſſy with gilding, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
one of the ſtate chairs at the Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre,
more than any thing elſe."</p>
            <p>"Yes," ſaid the Count, ſtopping a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0247300304:94"/>
to ſurvey it, "there is a hiſtory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that chair, but I have not time
to tell it.—Let us paſs on. This ſuite runs
to a greater extent than I had imagined; it
is many years ſince I was in them. But
where is the bed-room you ſpeak of, Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico?—theſe
are only anti-chambers to the
great drawing-room. I remember them in
their ſplendour!"</p>
            <p>"The bed, my Lord," replied Ludovico,
"they told me, was in a room that opens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ſaloon, and terminates the ſuite."</p>
            <p>"O, here is the ſaloon," ſaid the Count,
as they entered the ſpacious apartment, in
which Emily and Dorothée had reſted. He
here ſtood for a moment, ſurveying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of faded grandeur, which it exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited—the
ſumptuous tapeſtry—the long
and low ſophas of velvet, with frames hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
carved and gilded—the floor inlaid
with ſmall ſquares of fine marble, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the centre with a piece of very
rich tapeſtry-work—the caſements of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
glaſs; and the large Venetian mirrors, of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0247300304:95"/>
a ſize and quality, ſuch as at that period
France could not make, which reflected, on
every ſide, the ſpacious apartment. Theſe
had formerly alſo reflected a gay and bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
ſcene, for this had been the ſtate-room
of the chateau, and here the Marchioneſs
had held the aſſemblies, that made part of the
feſtivities of her nuptials. If the wand of
a magician could have recalled the vaniſhed
groups, many of them vaniſhed even from
the earth! that once had paſſed over theſe
poliſhed mirrors, what a varied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted
picture would they have exhibited
with the preſent! Now, inſtead of a blaze
of lights, and a ſplendid and buſy crowd,
they reflected only the rays of the one glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
lamp, which the Count held up,
and which ſcarcely ſerved to ſhew the three
forlorn figures, that ſtood ſurveying the
room, and the ſpacious and duſky walls
around them.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" ſaid the Count to Henri, awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his deep reverie, "how the ſcene
is changed ſince laſt I ſaw it! I was a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0247300304:96"/>
young man, then, and the Marchioneſs was
alive and in her bloom; many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were here, too, who are now no more!
There ſtood the orcheſtra; here we tripped
in many a ſprightly maze—the walls echo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the dance! Now, they reſound only
one feeble voice—and even that will, ere
long, be heard no more! My ſon, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that I was once as young as yourſelf,
and that you muſt paſs away like thoſe, who
have preceded you—like thoſe, who, as they
ſung and danced in this once gay apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
forgot, that years are made up of
moments, and that every ſtep they took
carried them nearer to their graves. But
ſuch reflections are uſeleſs, I had almoſt ſaid
criminal, unleſs they teach us to prepare for
eternity, ſince, otherwiſe, they cloud our
preſent happineſs, without guiding us to a
future one. But enough of this; let us go
on."</p>
            <p>Ludovico now opened the door of the
bed-room, and the Count, as he entered,
was ſtruck with the funereal appearance,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0247300304:97"/>
which the dark arras gave to it. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the bed, with an emotion of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
and, perceiving it to be covered
with the pall of black velvet, pauſed;
"What can this mean?" ſaid he, as he
gazed upon it.</p>
            <p>"I have heard, my Lord," ſaid Ludovico,
as he ſtood at the feet, looking within the
canopied curtains, "that the Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
de Villeroi died in this chamber,
and remained here till ſhe was removed to
be buried; and this, perhaps, Signor, may
account for the pall."</p>
            <p>The Count made no reply, but ſtood for
a few moments engaged in thought, and
evidently much affected. Then, turning
to Ludovico, he aſked him with a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
air, whether he thought his courage
would ſupport him through the night? "If
you doubt this," added the Count, "do not
be aſhamed to own it; I will releaſe you
from your engagement, without expoſing
you to the triumphs of your fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0247300304:98"/>
Ludovico pauſed; pride, and ſomething
very like fear, ſeemed ſtruggling in his
breaſt; pride, however, was victorious;—he
bluſhed, and his heſitation ceaſed.</p>
            <p>"No, my Lord," ſaid he, "I will go
through with what I have begun; and I am
grateful for your conſideration. On that
hearth I will make a fire, and, with the
good cheer in this baſket, I doubt not I
ſhall do well."</p>
            <p>"Be it ſo," ſaid the Count; "but how
will you beguile the tediouſneſs of the
night, if you do not ſleep?"</p>
            <p>"When I am weary, my Lord," replied
Ludovico, "I ſhall not fear to ſleep; in
the meanwhile I have a book, that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
me."</p>
            <p>"Well," ſaid the Count, "I hope no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will diſturb you; but if you ſhould be
ſeriouſly alarmed in the night, come to my
apartment. I have too much confidence in
your good ſenſe and courage, to believe you
will be alarmed on ſlight grounds; or ſuffer
the gloom of this chamber, or its remote
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0247300304:99"/>
ſituation, to overcome you with ideal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
To-morrow, I ſhall have to thank
you for an important ſervice; theſe rooms
ſhall then be thrown open, and my people
will be convinced of their error. Good
night, Ludovico; let me ſee you early in
the morning, and, remember what I lately
ſaid to you."</p>
            <p>"I will, my Lord; good night to your
<hi>Excellenza;</hi> let me attend you with the
light."</p>
            <p>He lighted the Count and Henri through
the chambers to the outer door; on the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place
ſtood a lamp, which one of the
affrighted ſervants had left, and Henri, as
he took it up, again bade Ludovico good
night, who, having reſpectfully returned
the wiſh, cloſed the door upon them, and
faſtened it. Then, as he retired to the
bed-chamber, he examined the rooms,
through which he paſſed, with more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs
than he had done before, for he
apprehended, that ſome perſon might have
concealed himſelf in them, for the purpoſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0247300304:100"/>
of frightening him. No one, however,
but himſelf, was in theſe chambers, and,
leaving open the doors, through which he
paſſed, he came again to the great drawing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
whoſe ſpaciouſneſs and ſilent gloom
ſomewhat awed him. For a moment he
ſtood, looking back through the long ſuite
of rooms he had quitted, and, as he turned,
perceiving a light and his own figure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
in one of the large mirrors, he ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Other objects too were ſeen obſcurely
on its dark ſurface, but he pauſed not to
examine them, and returned haſtily into
the bed-room, as he ſurveyed which, he
obſerved the door of the oriel, and opened
it. All within was ſtill. On looking
round, his eye was arreſted by the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait
of the deceaſed Marchioneſs, upon
which he gazed, for a conſiderable time,
with great attention and ſome ſurpriſe;
and then, having examined the cloſet, he
returned into the bed-room, where he kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
a wood fire, the bright blaze of which
reviſed his ſpirits, which had begun to yield
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0247300304:101"/>
to the gloom and ſilence of the place, for guſts
of wind alone broke at intervals this ſilence.
He now drew a ſmall table and a chair near
the fire, took a bottle of wine, and ſome
cold proviſion out of his baſket, and regaled
himſelf. When he had finiſhed his repaſt,
he laid his ſword upon the table, and, not
feeling diſpoſed to ſleep, drew from his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
the book he had ſpoken of.—It was a
volume of old Provençal tales. Having
ſtirred the fire into a brighter blaze, trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his lamp, and drawn his chair upon
the hearth, he began to read, and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was ſoon wholly occupied by the
ſcenes, which the page diſcloſed.</p>
            <p>The Count, meanwhile, had returned to
the ſupper-room, whither thoſe of the party,
who had attended him to the north apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had retreated, upon hearing Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thée's
ſcream, and who were now earneſt in
their enquiries concerning thoſe chambers.
The Count rallied his gueſts on their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
retreat, and on the ſuperſtitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
which had occaſioned it, and his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0247300304:102"/>
led to the queſtion, Whether the ſpirit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it has quitted the body, is ever permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to reviſit the earth; and if it is, whether
it was poſſible for ſpirits to become viſible
to the ſenſe. The Baron was of opinion,
that the firſt was probable, and the laſt was
poſſible, and he endeavoured to juſtify this
opinion by reſpectable authorities, both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and modern, which he quoted. The
Count, however, was decidedly againſt him,
and a long converſation enſued, in which the
uſual arguments on theſe ſubjects were on
both ſides brought forward with ſkill, and
diſcuſſed with candour, but without convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either party to the opinion of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
The effect of their converſation on
their auditors was various. Though the
Count had much the ſuperiority of the Baron
in point of argument, he had conſiderably
fewer adherents; for that love, ſo natural to
the human mind, of whatever is able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
its faculties with wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
attached the majority of the company
to the ſide of the Baron; and, though many
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0247300304:103"/>
of the Count's propoſitions were unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
his opponents were inclined to believe
this the conſequence of their own want of
knowledge, on ſo abſtracted a ſubject, rather
than that arguments did not exiſt, which
were forcible enough to conquer his.</p>
            <p>Blanche was pale with attention, till the
ridicule in her father's glance called a bluſh
upon her countenance, and ſhe then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to forget the ſuperſtitious tales ſhe
had been told in her convent. Meanwhile,
Emily had been liſtening with deep atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the diſcuſſion of what was to her a
very intereſting queſtion, and, remembering
the appearance ſhe had witneſſed in the
apartment of the late Marchioneſs, ſhe was
frequently chilled with awe. Several times
ſhe was on the point of mentioning what ſhe
had ſeen, but the fear of giving pain to the
Count, and the dread of his ridicule, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
her; and, awaiting in anxious expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
the event of Ludovico's intrepidity,
ſhe determined that her future ſilence ſhould
depend upon it.</p>
            <p>When the party had ſeparated for the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0247300304:104"/>
night, and the Count retired to his dreſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
the remembrance of the deſolate
ſcenes he had lately witneſſed in his own
manſion deeply affected him, but at length
he was arouſed from his reverie and his
ſilence. "What muſic is that I hear?"—ſaid
he ſuddenly to his valet, "Who plays
at this late hour?"</p>
            <p>The man made no reply, and the Count
continued to liſten, and then added, "That
is no common muſician; he touches the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
with a delicate hand; who is it,
Pierre?"</p>
            <p>"My Lord!" ſaid the man, heſitatingly.</p>
            <p>"Who plays that inſtrument?" repeated
the Count.</p>
            <p>"Does not your lordſhip know, then?"
ſaid the valet.</p>
            <p>"What mean you?" ſaid the Count,
ſomewhat ſternly.</p>
            <p>"Nothing, my Lord, I meant nothing,"
rejoined the man ſubmiſſively—"Only—that
muſic—goes about the houſe at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0247300304:105"/>
often, and I thought your lordſhip
might have heard it before."</p>
            <p>"Muſic goes about the houſe at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night!
Poor fellow!—does nobody dance
to the muſic, too?"</p>
            <p>"It is not in the chateau, I believe, my
Lord; the ſounds come from the woods,
they ſay, though they ſeem ſo near;—but
then a ſpirit can do any thing!"</p>
            <p>"Ah, poor fellow!" ſaid the Count, "I
perceive you are as ſilly as the reſt of them;
to-morrow, you will be convinced of your
ridiculous error. But hark!—what voice
is that?"</p>
            <p>"O my Lord! that is the voice we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hear with the muſic."</p>
            <p>"Often!" ſaid the Count, "How often,
pray? It is a very fine one."</p>
            <p>"Why, my Lord, I myſelf have not
heard it more than two or three times, but
there are thoſe who have lived here longer,
that have heard it often enoush."</p>
            <p>"What a ſwell was that!" exclaimed
the Count, as he ſtill liſtened, "And now,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0247300304:106"/>
what a dying cadence! This is ſurely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than mortal!"</p>
            <p>"That is what they ſay, my Lord," ſaid
the valet; "they ſay it is nothing mortal,
that utters it; and if I might ſay my
thoughts"—</p>
            <p>"Peace!" ſaid the Count, and he liſtened
till the ſtrain died away.</p>
            <p>"This is ſtrange!" ſaid he, as he turned
from the window, "Cloſe the caſements,
Pierre."</p>
            <p>Pierre obeyed, and the Count ſoon after
diſmiſſed him, but did not ſo ſoon loſe the
remembrance of the muſic, which long vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in his fancy in tones of melting ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
while ſurpriſe and perplexity engaged
his thoughts.</p>
            <p>Ludovico, meanwhile, in his remote
chamber, heard, now and then, the faint
echo of a cloſing door, as the family retired
to reſt, and then the hall clock, at a great
diſtance, ſtrike twelve. "It is midnight,"
ſaid he, and he looked ſuſpiciouſly round
the ſpacious chamber. The fire on the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0247300304:107"/>
hearth was now nearly expiring, for his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
having been engaged by the book
before him, he had forgotten every thing
beſides; but he ſoon added freſh wood,
not becauſe he was cold, though the night
was ſtormy, but becauſe he was cheerleſs;
and, having again trimmed his lamp, he
poured out a glaſs of wine, drew his chair
nearer to the crackling blaze, tried to be deaf
to the wind, that howled mournfully at the
caſements, endeavoured to abſtract his mind
from the melancholy, that was ſtealing upon
him, and again took up his book. It had
been lent to him by Dorothée, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
picked it up in anobſcure corner of the
Marquis's library, and who, having opened
it and perceived ſome of the marvels it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
had carefully preſerved it for her
own entertainment, its condition giving her
ſome excuſe for detaining it from its proper
ſtation. The damp corner into which it had
fallen, had cauſed the cover to be disfigured
and mouldy, and the leaves to be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured
with ſpots, that it was not without
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0247300304:108"/>
difficulty the letters could be traced. The
fictions of the Provençal writers, whether
drawn from the Arabian legends, brought
by the Saracens into Spain, or recounting
the chivalric exploits performed by the
cruſaders, whom the Troubadours accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
to the eaſt, were generally ſplendid
and always marvellous, both in ſcenery and
incident; and it is not wonderful, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothée
and Ludovico ſhould be faſcinated by
inventions, which had captivated the careleſs
imagination in every rank of ſociety, in a
former age. Some of the tales, however, in
the book now before Ludovico, were of
ſimple ſtructure, and exhibited nothing of
the magnificent machinery and heroic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which uſually characterized the fables
of the twelfth century, and of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was the one he now happened to open,
which, in its original ſtyle, was of great
length, but which may be thus ſhortly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
The reader will perceive, that it is
ſtrongly tinctured with the ſuperſtition of
the times.</p>

                        <p>THERE lived, in the province of Bretagne,
a noble Baron, famous for his-magnificence
and courtly hoſpitalities. His caſtle was
graced with ladies of exquiſite beauty, and
thronged with illuſtrious knights; for the
honours he paid to feats of chivalry invited
the brave of diſtant countries to enter his
liſts, and his court was more ſplendid than
thoſe of many princes. Eight minſtrels were
retained in his ſervice, who uſed to ſing to
their harps romantic fictions, taken from
the Arabians, or adventures of chivalry, that
befel knights during the cruſades, or the
martial deeds of the Baron, their lord;—while
he, ſurrounded by his knights and
ladies, banqueted in the great hall of his
caſtle, where the coſtly tapeſtry, that adorned
the walls with pictured exploits of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
the caſements of painted glaſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with armorial bearings, the gorgeous
banners, that waved along the roof, the
ſumptuous canopies, the profuſion of gold
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0247300304:110"/>
and ſilver, that glittered on the ſideboards,
the numerous diſhes, that covered the tables,
the number and gay liveries of the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
with the chivalric and ſplendid attire
of the gueſts, united to form a ſcene of
magnificence, ſuch as we may not hope to
ſee in theſe <hi>degenerate days.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of the Baron, the following adventure is
related. One night, having retired late from
the banquet to his chamber, and diſmiſſed
his attendants, he was ſurpriſed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a ſtranger of a noble air, but of
a ſorrowful and dejected countenance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that this perſon had been ſecreted
in the apartment, ſince it appeared impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
he could have lately paſſed the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
unobſerved by the pages in waiting,
who would have prevented this intruſion on
their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his
people, drew his ſword, which he had not
yet taken from his ſide, and ſtood upon his
defence. The ſtranger ſlowly advancing,
told him, that there was nothing to fear;
that he came with no hoſtile deſign, but to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0247300304:111"/>
communicate to him a terrible ſecret, which
it was neceſſary for him to know.</p>
                        <p>The Baron, appeaſed by the courteous
manners of the ſtranger, after ſurveying him,
for ſome time, in ſilence, returned his ſword
into the ſcabbard, and deſired him to explain
the means, by which he had obtained acceſs
to the chamber, and the purpoſe of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
viſit.</p>
                        <p>Without anſwering either of theſe enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the ſtranger ſaid, that he could not then
explain himſelf, but that, if the Baron would
follow him to the edge of the foreſt, at a
ſhort diſtance from the caſtle walls, he would
there convince him, that he had ſomething
of importance to diſcloſe.</p>
                        <p>This propoſal again alarmed the Baron,
who could ſcarcely believe, that the ſtranger
meant to draw him to ſo ſolitary a ſpot, at
this hour of the night, without harbouring
a deſign againſt his life, and he refuſed to
go, obſerving, at the ſame time, that, if the
ſtranger's purpoſe was an honourable one, he
would not perſiſt in refuſing to reveal the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0247300304:112"/>
occaſion of his viſit, in the apartment where
they were.</p>
                        <p>While he ſpoke this, he viewed the
ſtranger ſtill more attentively than before,
but obſerved no change in his countenance,
or any ſymptom, that might intimate a
conſciouſneſs of evil deſign. He was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
like a knight, was of a tall and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic
ſtature, and of dignified and courteous
manners. Still, however, he refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the ſubject of his errand in any
place, but that he had mentioned, and, at
the ſame time, gave hints concerning the
ſecret he would diſcloſe, that awakened a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſolemn curioſity in the Baron, which,
at length, induced him to conſent to follow
the ſtranger, on certain conditions.</p>
                        <p>"Sir knight," ſaid he, "I will attend
you to the foreſt, and will take with me only
four of my people, who ſhall witneſs our
conference."</p>
                        <p>To this, however, the Knight objected.</p>
                        <p>"What I would diſcloſe," ſaid he, with
ſolemnity, "is to you alone. There are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0247300304:113"/>
only three living perſons, to whom the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
is known; it is of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to you and your houſe, than I ſhall
now explain. In future years, you will look
back to this night with ſatisfaction or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
accordingly as you now determine.
As you would hereafter proſper—follow
me; I pledge you the honour of a knight,
that no evil ſhall befall you;—if you are
contented to dare futurity—remain in your
chamber, and I will depart as I came."</p>
                        <p>"Sir knight," replied the Baron, "how
is it poſſible, that my future peace can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon my preſent determination?"</p>
                        <p>"That is not now to be told," ſaid the
ſtranger, "I have explained myſelf to the
utmoſt. It is late; if you follow me it muſt
be quickly;—you will do well to conſider
the alternative."</p>
                        <p>The Baron muſed, and, as he looked
upon the knight, he perceived his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
aſſume a ſingular ſolemnity.</p>
                        <p>[Here Ludovico thought he heard a noiſe,
and he threw a glance round the chamber,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0247300304:114"/>
and then held up the lamp to aſſiſt his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
but, not perceiving any thing to
confirm his alarm, he took up the book
again and purſued the ſtory.]</p>
                        <p>The Baron paced his apartment, for
ſome time, in ſilence, impreſſed by the laſt
words of the ſtranger, whoſe extraordinary
requeſt he feared to grant, and feared, alſo,
to refuſe. At length, he ſaid, "Sir knight,
you are utterly unknown to me; tell me
yourſelf,—is it reaſonable, that I ſhould
truſt myſelf alone with a ſtranger, at this
hour, in a ſolitary foreſt? Tell me, at leaſt,
who you are, and who aſſiſted to ſecrete you
in this chamber."</p>
                        <p>The knight frowned at theſe latter words,
and was a moment ſilent; then, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
ſomewhat ſtern, he ſaid,</p>
                        <p>"I am an Engliſh knight; I am called
Sir Bevys of Lancaſter,—and my deeds are
not unknown at the Holy City, whence
I was returning to my native land, when
I was benighted in the neighbouring foreſt."</p>
                        <p>"Your name is not unknown to fame,"
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0247300304:115"/>
ſaid the Baron, "I have heard of it."
(The Knight looked haughtily.) "But
why, ſince my caſtle is known to entertain
all true knights, did not your herald an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
you? Why did you not appear at
the banquet, where your preſence would
have been welcomed, inſtead of hiding your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in my caſtle and ſtealing to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
at midnight?"</p>
                        <p>The ſtranger frowned, and turned away in
ſilence; but the Baron repeated the queſtions.</p>
                        <p>"I come not," ſaid the Knight, "to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
enquiries, but to reveal facts. If you
would know more, follow me, and again I
pledge the honour of a Knight, that you
ſhall return in ſafety.—Be quick in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination—I
muſt be gone."</p>
                        <p>After ſome further heſitation, the Baron
determined to follow the ſtranger, and to
ſee the reſult of his extraordinary requeſt;
he, therefore, again drew forth his ſword,
and, taking up a lamp, bade the Knight lead
on. The latter obeyed, and, opening the
door of the chamber, they paſſed into the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0247300304:116"/>
anti-room, where the Baron, ſurpriſed to find
all his pages aſleep, ſtopped, and, with haſty
violence, was going to reprimand them for
their careleſſneſs, when the Knight waved
his hand, and looked ſo expreſſively upon
the Baron, that the latter reſtrained his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
and paſſed on.</p>
                        <p>The Knight, having deſcended a ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
opened a ſecret door, which the Baron
had believed was known only to himſelf,
and, proceeding through ſeveral narrow and
winding paſſages, came, at length, to a ſmall
gate, that opened beyond the walls of the
caſtle. Meanwhile, the Baron followed in
ſilence and amazement, on perceiving that
theſe ſecret paſſages were ſo well known to
a ſtranger, and felt inclined to return from
an adventure, that appeared to partake of
treachery, as well as danger. Then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that he was armed, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the courteous and noble air of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor,
his courage returned, he bluſhed,
that it had failed him for a moment, and he
reſolved to trace the myſtery to its ſource.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0247300304:117"/>
He now found himſelf on the heathy
platform, before the great gates of his caſtle,
where, on looking up, he perceived lights
glimmering in the different caſements of the
gueſts, who were retiring to ſleep; and,
while he ſhivered in the blaſt, and looked
on the dark and deſolate ſcene around him,
he thought of the comforts of his warm
chamber, rendered cheerful by the blaze of
wood, and felt, for a moment, the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt
of his preſent ſituation.</p>
                        <p>[Here Ludovico pauſed a moment, and,
looking at his own fire, gave it a brightening
ſtir.]</p>
                        <p>The wind was ſtrong, and the Baron
watched his lamp with anxiety, expecting
every moment to ſee it extinguiſhed; but,
though the flame wavered, it did not expire,
and he ſtill followed the ſtranger, who often
ſighed as he went, but did not ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>When they reached the borders of the
foreſt, the Knight turned, and raiſed his head,
as if he meant to addreſs the Baron, but then,
cloſing his lips in ſilence, he walked on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0247300304:118"/>
As they entered, beneath the dark and
ſpreading boughs, the Baron, affected by
the ſolemnity of the ſccne, heſitated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to proceed, and demanded how much
further they were to go. The Knight replied
only by a geſture, and the Baron, with heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
ſteps and a ſuſpicious eye, followed
through an obſcure and intricate path, till,
having proceeded a conſiderable way, he
again demanded whither they were going,
and refuſed to proceed unleſs he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                        <p>As he ſaid this, he looked at his own
ſword, and at the Knight alternately, who
ſhook his head, and whoſe dejected counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
diſarmed the Baron, for a moment,
of ſuſpicion.</p>
                        <p>"A little further is the place, whither I
would lead you," ſaid the ſtranger; "no evil
ſhall befall you—I have ſworn it on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a knight."</p>
                        <p>The Baron, re-aſſured, again followed in
ſilence, and they ſoon arrived at a deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the foreſt, where the dark and lofty
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0247300304:119"/>
cheſnuts entirely excluded the ſky, and which
was ſo overgrown with underwood, that they
proceeded with difficulty. The Knight ſighed
deeply as he paſſed, and ſometimes pauſed;
and having, at length, reached a ſpot, where
the trees crowded into a knot, he turned,
and, with a terrific look, pointing to the
ground, the Baron ſaw there the body of
a man, ſtretched at its length, and welter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in blood; a ghaſtly wound was on the
forehead, and death appeared already to have
contracted the features.</p>
                        <p>The Baron, on perceiving the ſpectacle,
ſtarted in horror, looked at the Knight for
explanation, and was then going to raiſe the
body and examine if there were yet any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of life; but the ſtranger, waving his
hand, fixed upon him a look ſo earneſt and
mournful, as not only much ſurpriſed him,
but made him deſiſt.</p>
                        <p>But, what were the Baron's emotions,
when, an holding the lamp near the features
of the corpſe, he diſcovered the exact reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the ſtranger his conductor, to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0247300304:120"/>
whom he now looked up in aſtoniſhment
and enquiry? As he gazed, he perceived
the countenance of the Knight change, and
begin to fade, till his whole form gradually
vaniſhed from his aſtoniſhed ſenſe! While
the Baron ſtood, fixed to the ſpot, a voice
was heard to utter theſe words:—</p>
                        <p>[Ludovico ſtarted, and laid down the
book, for he thought he heard a voice in
the chamber, and he looked toward the bed,
where, however, he ſaw only the dark cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and the pall. He liſtened, ſcarcely
daring to draw his breath, but heard only
the diſtant roaring of the ſea in the ſtorm,
and the blaſt, that ruſhed by the caſements;
when, concluding, that he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by its ſighings, he took up his book
to finiſh the ſtory.]</p>
                        <p>While the Baron ſtood, fixed to the
ſpot, a voice was heard to utter theſe
words:—</p>
                        <p>"The body of Sir Bevys of Lancaſter,
a noble knight of England, lies before you.
He was, this night, way laid and murdered,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0247300304:121"/>
as he journeyed from the Holy City towards
his native land. Reſpect the honour of
knighthood and the law of humanity; inter
the body in chriſtian ground, and cauſe his
murderers to be puniſhed. As ye obſerve,
or neglect this, ſhall peace and happineſs,
or war and miſery, light upon you and your
houſe for ever"</p>
                        <p>The Baron, when he recovered from the
awe and aſtoniſhment, into which this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
had thrown him, returned to his
caſtle, whither he cauſed the body of Sir
Bevys to be removed; and, on the following
day, it was interred, with the honours of
knighthood, in the chapel of the caſtle, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by all the noble knights and ladies,
who graced the court of the Baron de
Brunne.</p>

            <p>Ludovico, having finiſhed this ſtory, laid
aſide the book, for he felt drowſy, and, after
putting more wood on the fire and taking
another glaſs of wine, he repoſed himſelf in
the arm chair on the hearth. In his dream he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0247300304:122"/>
ſtill beheld the chamber where he really was,
and, once or twice, ſtarted from imperfect
ſlumbers, imagining he ſaw a man's face,
looking over the high back of his arm-chair.
This idea had ſo ſtrongly-impreſſed him, that,
when he raiſed his eyes, he almoſt expected to
meet other eyes, fixed upon his own, and he
quitted his ſeat and looked behind the chair,

            <p>THE Count, who had ſlept little during
the night, roſe early, and, anxious to ſpeak
with Ludovico, went to the north apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but, the outer door having been faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
on the preceding night, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to knock loudly for admittance.
Neither the knocking, or his voice was
heard; but, conſidering the diſtance of this
door from the bed-room, and that Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico,
wearied with watching, had probably
fallen into a deep ſleep, the Count was not
ſurpriſed on receiving no anſwer, and, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the door, he went down to walk in his
grounds.</p>
            <p>It was a gray autumnal morning. The
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0247300304:124"/>
ſun, riſing over Provence, gave only a feeble
light, as his rays ſtruggled through the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
that aſcended from the ſea, and ſloated
heavily over the wood-tops, which were now
varied with many a mellow tint of autumn.
The ſtorm was paſſed, but the waves were
yet violently agitated, and their courſe was
traced by long lines of foam, while not a
breeze ſluttered in the ſails of the veſſels,
near the ſhore, that were weighing anchor
to depart. The ſtill gloom of the hour
was pleaſing to the Count, and he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
his way through the woods, ſunk in
deep thought.</p>
            <p>Emily alſo roſe at an early hour, and
took her cuſtomary walk along the brow
of the promontory, that overhung the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean.
Her mind was now not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
with the occurrences of the chateau,
and Valancourt was the ſubject of her
mournful thoughts; whom ſhe had not
yet taught herſelf to conſider with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
though her judgment conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
her for the affection, that lingered
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0247300304:125"/>
in her heart, after her eſteem for him was
departed. Remembrance frequently gave
her his parting look and the tones of his
voice, when he had bade her a laſt farewel;
and, ſome accidental aſſociations now recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe circumſtances to her fancy, with
peculiar energy, ſhe ſhed bitter tears to the
recollection.</p>
            <p>Having reached the watch-tower, ſhe
ſeated herſelf on the broken ſteps, and, in
melancholy dejection, watched the waves,
half hid in vapour, as they came rolling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſhore, and threw up their light
ſpray round the rocks below. Their hollow
murmur and the obſcuring miſts, that came
in wreaths up the cliffſs, gave a ſolemnity
to the ſcene, which was in harmony with
the temper of her mind, and ſhe ſat, given
up to the remembrance of paſt times, till
this became too painful, and ſhe abruptly
quitted the place. On paſſing the little
gate of the watch-tower, ſhe obſerved let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
engraved on the ſtone poſtern, which
ſhe pauſed to examine, and, though they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0247300304:126"/>
appeared to have been rudely cut with a
pen-knife, the characters were familiar to
her; at length, recognizing the hand-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Valancourt, ſhe read, with trembling
anxiety, the following lines, entitled</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <head>SHIPWRECK.</head>
                  <l>'Tis ſolemn midnight! On this lonely ſteep,</l>
                  <l>Beneath this watch-tow'r's deſolated wall,</l>
                  <l>Where myſtic ſhapes the wonderer appall,</l>
                  <l>I reſt; and view below the deſert deep,</l>
                  <l>As through tempeſtuous clouds the moon's cold light</l>
                  <l>Gleams on the wave. Viewleſs, the winds of night</l>
                  <l>With loud myſterious force the billows ſweep,</l>
                  <l>And ſullen roar the ſurges, far below.</l>
                  <l>In the ſtill pauſes of the guſt I hear</l>
                  <l>The voice of ſpirits, riſing ſweet and ſlow,</l>
                  <l>And oft among the clouds their forms appear.</l>
                  <l>But hark! what ſhriek of death comes in the gale,</l>
                  <l>And in the diſtant ray what glimmering ſail</l>
                  <l>Bends to the ſtorm?—Now ſinks the note of fear!</l>
                  <l>Ah! wretched mariners!—no more ſhall day</l>
                  <l>Uncloſe his cheering eye to light ye on your way!</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>From theſe lines it appeared, that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
had viſited the tower; that he had
probably been here on the preceding night,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0247300304:127"/>
for it was ſuch an one as they deſcribed,
and that he had left the building very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſince it had not long been light, and
without light it was impoſſible theſe letters
could have been cut. It was thus even
probable, that he might be yet in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</p>
            <p>As theſe reflections paſſed rapidly over
the mind of Emily, they called up a variety
of contending emotions, that almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her ſpirits; but her firſt impulſe was
to avoid him, and, immediately leaving
the tower, ſhe returned, with haſty ſteps,
towards the chateau. As ſhe paſſed along,
ſhe remembered the muſic ſhe had lately
heard near the tower, with the figure, which
had appeared, and, in this moment of agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
ſhe was inclined to believe, that
ſhe had then heard and ſeen Valancourt;
but other recollections ſoon convinced her
of her error. On turning into a thicker
part of the woods, ſhe perceived a perſon,
walking ſlowly in the gloom at ſome little
diſtance, and, her mind engaged by the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0247300304:128"/>
idea of him, ſhe ſtarted and pauſed, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
this to be Valancourt. The perſon
advanced with quicker ſteps, and, before
ſhe could recover recollection enough to
avoid him, he ſpoke, and ſhe then knew the
voice of the Count, who expreſſed ſome
ſurpriſe, on finding her walking at ſo early
an hour, and made a feeble effort to rally
her on her love of ſolitude. But he ſoon
perceived this to be more a ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
than of light laughter, and, changing
his manner, affectionately expoſtulated with
Emily, on thus indulging unavailing regret;
who, though ſhe acknowledged the juſtneſs
of all he ſaid, could not reſtrain her tears,
while ſhe did ſo, and he preſently quitted
the topic. Expreſſing ſurpriſe at not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet heard from his friend, the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
at Avignon, in anſwer to the queſtions
propoſed to him, respecting the eſtates of
the late Madame Montoni, he, with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
zeal, endeavoured to cheer Emily with
hopes of eſtabliſhing her claim to them;
while ſhe felt, that the eſtates could now
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0247300304:129"/>
contribute little to the happineſs of a life,
in which Valancourt had no longer an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>When they returned to the chateau,
Emily retired to her apartment, and Count
De Villefort to the door of the north cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
This was ſtill faſtened, but, being now
determined to arouſe Ludovico, he renewed
his calls more loudly than before, after
which a total ſilence enſued, and the Count,
finding all his efforts to be heard ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
at length began to fear, that ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
had befallen Ludovico, whom ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of an imaginary being might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of his ſenſes. He, therefore, left
the door with an intention of ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſervants to force it open, ſome of
whom he now heard moving in the lower
part of the chateau.</p>
            <p>To the Count's enquiries, whether they
had ſeen or heard Ludovico, they replied
in affright, that not one of them had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
on the north ſide of the chateau, ſince
the preceding night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0247300304:130"/>
"He ſleeps ſoundly then," ſaid the
Count, "and is at ſuch a diſtance from the
outer door, which is faſtened, that to gain
admittance to the chambers it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to force it. Bring an inſtrument, and
follow me."</p>
            <p>The ſervants ſtood mute and dejected,
and it was not till nearly all the houſehold
were aſſembled, that the Count's orders
were obeyed. In the mean time Dorothée
was telling of a door, that opened from a
gallery, leading from the great ſtair-caſe
into the laſt anti-room of the ſaloon, and,
this being much nearer to the bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
it appeared probable, that Ludovico
might be eaſily awakened by an attempt to
open it. Thither, therefore, the Count
went, but his voice was as ineffectual at
this door as it had proved at the remoter
one; and now, ſeriouſly intereſted for Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,
he was himſelf going to ſtrike upon
the door with the inſtrument, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
its ſingular beauty, and with-held
the blow. It appeared, on the firſt glance,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0247300304:131"/>
to be of ebony, ſo dark and cloſe was its
grain and ſo high its poliſh; but it proved
to be only of larch wood, of the growth of
Provence, then famous for its foreſts of
larch. The beauty of its poliſhed hue and
of its delicate carvings determined the
Count to ſpare this door, and he returned
to that leading from the back ſtair-caſe,
which being, at length, forced, he entered
the firſt anti-room, followed by Henri
and a few of the moſt courageous of his
ſervants, the reſt awaiting the event of
the enquiry on the ſtairs and landing-place.</p>
            <p>All was ſilent in the chambers, through
which the Count paſſed, and, having reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſaloon, he called loudly upon Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico;
after which, ſtill receiving no anſwer,
he threw open the door of the bed-room,
and entered.</p>
            <p>The profound ſtillneſs within confirmed
his apprehenſions for Ludovico, for not even
the breathings of a perſon in ſleep were
heard; and his uncertainty was not ſoon ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0247300304:132"/>
ſince, the ſhutters being all cloſed,
the chamber was too dark for any object to
be diſtinguiſhed in it.</p>
            <p>The Count bade a ſervant open them,
who, as he croſſed the room to do ſo,
ſtumbled over ſomething, and fell to the
floor, when his cry occaſioned ſuch panic
among the few of his fellows, who had
ventured thus far, that they inſtantly fled,
and the Count and Henri were left to finish
the adventure.</p>
            <p>Henri then ſprung acroſs the room, and,
opening a window-ſhutter, they perceived,
that the man had fallen over a chair near
the hearth, in which Ludovico had been
ſitting;—for he ſat there no longer, nor
could any where be ſeen by the imperfect
light, that was admitted into the apartment.
The Count, ſeriouſly alarmed, now opened
other ſhutters, that he might be enabled to
examine further, and, Ludovico not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
he ſtood for a moment, ſuſpended
in aſtoniſhment and ſcarcely truſting his
ſenſes, till, his eyes glancing on the bed, he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0247300304:133"/>
advanced, to examine whether he was there
aſleep. No perſon, however, was in it,
and he proceeded to the oriel, where every
thing remained as on the preceding night,
but Ludovico was no where to be found.</p>
            <p>The Count now checked his amazement,
conſidering, that Ludovico might have left
the chambers, during the night, overcome
by the terrors, which their lonely deſolation
and the recollected reports, concerning
them, had inſpired. Yet, if this had been
the fact, the man would naturally have
ſought ſociety, and his fellow ſervants had
all declared they had not ſeen him; the
door of the outer room alſo had been
found faſtened, with the key on the inſide;
it was impoſſible, therefore, for him to
have paſſed through that, and all the outer
doors of this ſuite were found, on examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be bolted and locked, with the
keys alſo within them. The Count, being
then compelled to believe, that the lad had
eſcaped through the caſements, next exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them, but ſuch as opened wide
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0247300304:134"/>
enough to admit the body of a man were
found to be carefully ſecured either by iron
bars, or by ſhutters, and no veſtige appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of any perſon having attempted to paſs
them; neither was it probable, that Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico
would have incurred the riſque of
breaking his neck, by leaping from a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
when he might have walked ſafely
through a door.</p>
            <p>The Count's amazement did not admit
of words; but he returned once more to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the bed-room, where was no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of diſorder, except that occaſioned by
the late overthrow of the chair, near which
had ſtood a ſmall table, and on this Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico's
ſword, his lamp, the book he
had been reading, and the remnant of
his flaſk of wine ſtill remained. At the
foot of the table, too, was the baſket with
ſome fragments of proviſion and wood.</p>
            <p>Henri and the ſervant now uttered their
aſtoniſhment without reſerve, and, though
the Count ſaid little, there was a ſeriouſneſs
in his manner, that expreſſed much. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0247300304:135"/>
that Ludovico muſt have quitted
theſe rooms by ſome concealed paſſage, for
the Count could not believe, that any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
means had occaſioned this event, yet,
if there was any ſuch paſſage, it ſeemed inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
why he ſhould retreat through it,
and it was equally ſurpriſing, that not even
the ſmalleſt veſtige ſhould appear, by which
his progreſs could be traced. In the rooms
every thing remained as much in order as
if he had juſt walked out by the common
way.</p>
            <p>The Count himſelf aſſiſted in lifting the
arras, with which the bed-chamber, ſaloon
and one of the anti-rooms were hung, that
he might diſcover if any door had been
concealed behind it; but, after a laborious
ſearch, none was found, and he, at length,
quitted the apartments, having ſecured the
door of the laſt anti-chamber, the key of
which he took into his own poſſeſſion. He
then gave orders, that ſtrict ſearch ſhould
be made for Ludovico not only in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
but in the neighbourhood, and, retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0247300304:136"/>
with Henri to his cloſet, they remained
there in converſation for a conſiderable
time, and whatever was the ſubject of it,
Henri from this hour loſt much of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity,
and his manners were particularly
grave and reſerved, whenever the topic,
which now agitated the Count's family
with wonder and alarm, was introduced.</p>
            <p>On the diſappearing of Ludovico, Baron
St. Foix ſeemed ſtrengthened in all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
opinions concerning the probability of
apparitions, though it was difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what connection there could poſſibly
be between the two ſubjects, or to account
for this effect otherwiſe than by ſuppoſing,
that the myſtery attending Ludovico, by
exciting awe and curioſity, reduced the
mind to a ſtate of ſenſibility, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it more liable to the influence of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
in general. It is, however, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that from this period the Baron and
his adherents became more bigoted to their
own ſyſtems than before, while the terrors
of the Count's ſervants increaſed to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0247300304:137"/>
that occaſioned many of them to quit
the manſion immediately, and the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
only till others could be procured,
to ſupply their places.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſtrenuous ſearch after Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico
proved unſucceſsful, and, after ſeveral
days of indefatigable enquiry, poor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette
gave herſelf up to deſpair, and the
other inhabitants of the chateau to amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Emily, whoſe mind had been deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the diſaſtrous fate of the late Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
and with the myſterious connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ſhe fancied had exiſted between
her and St. Aubert, was particularly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the late extraordinary event, and
much concerned for the loſs of Ludovico,
whoſe integrity and faithful ſervices claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both her eſteem and gratitude. She
was now very deſirous to return to the quiet
retirement of her convent, but every hint
of this was received with real ſorrow by the
Lady Blanche, and affectionately ſet aſide
by the Count, for whom ſhe felt much of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0247300304:138"/>
the reſpectful love and admiration of a
daughter, and to whom, by Dorothée's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ſhe, at length mentioned the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which they had witneſſed in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the deceaſed Marchioneſs. At any
other period, he would have ſmiled at ſuch
a relation, and have believed, that its object
had exiſted only in the diſtempered fancy of
the relater; but he now attended to Emily
with ſeriouſneſs, and, when ſhe concluded,
requeſted of her a promiſe, that this occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ſhould reſt in ſilence. "Whatever
may be the cauſe and the import of theſe
extraordinary occurrences," added the
Count, "time only can explain them. I
ſhall keep a wary eye upon all that paſſes
in the chateau, and ſhall purſue every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
means of diſcovering the fate of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico.
Meanwhile, we muſt be prudent
and be ſilent. I will myſelf watch in the
north chambers, but of this we will ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
till the night arrives, when I purpoſe
doing ſo."</p>
            <p>The Count then ſent for Dorothée, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0247300304:139"/>
required of her alſo a promiſe of ſilence,
concerning what ſhe had already, or might
in future witneſs of an extraordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and this ancient ſervant now related
to him the particulars of the Marchioneſs
de Villeroi's death, with ſome of which he
appeared to be already acquainted, while
by others he was evidently ſurpriſed and
agitated. After liſtening to this narrative,
the Count retired to his cloſet, where he
remained alone for ſeveral hours; and,
when he again appeared, the folemnity of
his manner ſurpriſed and alarmed Emily,
but ſhe gave no utterance to her thoughts.</p>
            <p>On the week following the diſappearance
of Ludovico, all the Count's gueſts took
leave of him, except the Baron, his ſon
Monſ. St. Foix, and Emily; the latter of
whom was ſoon after embarraſſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
by the arrival of another viſitor,
Monſ. Du Pont, which made her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
upon withdrawing to her convent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.
The delight, that appeared in
his countenance, when he met her, told
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0247300304:140"/>
that he brought back the ſame ardour of
paſſion, which had formerly baniſhed him
from Chateau-le-Blanc. He was received
with reſerve by Emily, and with pleaſure by
the Count, who preſented him to her with
a ſmile, that ſeemed intended to plead his
cauſe, and who did not hope the leſs for
his friend, from the embarraſſment ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</p>
            <p>But M. Du Pont, with truer ſympathy,
ſeemed to underſtand her manner, and his
countenance quickly loſt its vivacity, and
ſunk into the languor of deſpondency.</p>
            <p>On the following day, however, he ſought
an opportunity of declaring the purport of
bis viſit, and renewed his ſuit; a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was received with real concern
by Emily, who endeavoured to leſſen the
pain ſhe might inſlict by a ſecond rejection,
with aſſurances of eſteem and friendſhip; yet
ſhe left him in a ſtate of mind, that claimed
and excited her tendereſt compaſſion; and,
being more ſenſible than ever of the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of remaining longer at the chateau,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0247300304:141"/>
ſhe immediately ſought the Count, and
communicated to him her intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the convent.</p>
            <p>"My dear Emily," ſaid he, "I obſerve,
with extreme concern, the illuſion you are
encouraging—an illuſion common to young
and ſenſible minds. Your heart has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a ſevere ſhock; you believe you can
never entirely recover it, and you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
this belief, till the habit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
ſorrow will ſubdue the ſtrength of
your mind, and diſcolour your future views
with melancholy and regret. Let me diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
this illuſion, and awaken you to a ſenſe
of your danger."</p>
            <p>Emily ſmiled mournfully, "I know
what you would ſay, my dear ſir," ſaid ſhe,
"and am prepared to anſwer you. I feel,
that my heart can never know a ſecond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and that I muſt never hope even to
recover its tranquillity—if I ſuffer myſelf
to enter into a ſecond engagement."</p>
            <p>"I know, that you feel all this," replied
the Count; "and I know, alſo, that time
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0247300304:142"/>
will overcome theſe feelings, unleſs you che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
them in ſolitude, and, pardon me, with
romantic tenderneſs. Then, indeed, time
will only confirm habit. I am particularly
empowered to ſpeak on this ſubject, and to
ſympathize in your ſufferings," added the
Count, with an air of ſolemnity, "for I
have known what it is to love, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the object of my love. Yes," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
he, while his eyes filled with rears, "I
have ſuffered!—but thoſe times have paſſed
away—long paſſed! and I can now look
back upon them without emotion."</p>
            <p>"My dear ſir," ſaid Emily, timidly,
"what mean thoſe tears?—they ſpeak, I
fear, another language—they plead for me."</p>
            <p>"They are weak tears, for they are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ones," replied the Count, drying them,
"I would have you ſuperior to ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Theſe, however, are only faint traces
of a grief, which, if it had not been
oppoſed by long continued effort, might
have led me to the verge of madneſs!
Judge, then, whether I have not cauſe to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0247300304:143"/>
warn you of an indulgence, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſo terrible an effect, and which muſt
certainly, if not oppoſed, overcloud the
years, that otherwiſe might be happy. M.
Du Pont is a ſenſible and amiable man, who
has long been tenderly attached to you;
his family and fortune are unexceptionable;—after
what I have ſaid, it is unneceſſary
to add, that I ſhould rejoice in your felicity,
and that I think M. Du Pont would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it. Do not weep, Emily," continued
the Count, taking her hand, "there is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
reſerved for you."</p>
            <p>He was ſilent a moment; and then
added, in a firmer voice, "I do not wiſh,
that you ſhould make a violent effort to
overcome your feelings; all I, at preſent,
aſk, is, that you will check the thoughts,
that would lead you to a remembrance of
the paſt; that you will ſuffer your mind to be
engaged by preſent objects; that you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
yourſelf to believe it poſſible you may
yet be happy; and that you will ſometimes
think with complacency of poor Du Pont,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0247300304:144"/>
and not condemn him to the ſtate of deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
from which, my dear Emily, I am
endeavouring to withdraw you."</p>
            <p>"Ah! my dear ſir," ſaid Emily, while
her tears ſtill fell, "do not ſuffer the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
of your wiſhes to miſlead Monſ.Du
Pont with an expectation that I can ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his hand. If I underſtand my own
heart, this never can be; your inſtruction I
can obey in almoſt every other particular,
than that of adopting a contrary belief."</p>
            <p>"Leave me to underſtand your heart,"
replied the Count, with a faint ſmile. "If
you pay me the compliment to be guided by
my advice in other inſtances, I will pardon
your incredulity, reſpecting your future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
towards Monſ. Du Pont. I will not
even preſs you to remain longer at the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau
than your own ſatisfaction will permit;
but though I forbear to oppoſe your preſent
retirement, I ſhall urge the claims of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for your future viſits."</p>
            <p>Tears of gratitude mingled with thoſe of
tender regret, while Emily thanked the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0247300304:145"/>
Count for the many inſtances of friendſhip
ſhe had received from him; promiſed to
be directed by his advice upon every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
but one, and aſſured him of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
with which ſhe ſhould, at ſome future
period, accept the invitation of the Counteſs
and himſelf—if Monſ. Du Pont was not at
the chateau.</p>
            <p>The Count ſmiled at this condition. "Be
it ſo," ſaid he, "meanwhile the convent is
ſo near the chateau, that my daughter and
I ſhall often viſit you; and if, ſometimes,
we ſhould dare to bring you another viſitor—will
you forgive us?"</p>
            <p>Emily looked diſtreſſed, and remained
ſilent.</p>
            <p>"Well," rejoined the Count, "I will
purſue this ſubject no further, and muſt
now entreat your forgiveneſs for having
preſſed it thus far. You will, however, do
me the juſtice to believe, that I have been
urged only by a ſincere regard for your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and that of my amiable friend Monſ.
Du Pont."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0247300304:146"/>
Emily, when ſhe left the Count, went to
mention her intended departure to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs,
who oppoſed it with polite expreſſions
of regret; after which, ſhe ſent a note to
acquaint the lady abbeſs, that ſhe ſhould
return to the convent; and thither ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
on the evening of the following day.
M. Du Pont, in extreme regret, ſaw her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
while the Count endeavoured to cheer
him with a hope, that Emily would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
regard him with a more favourable
eye.</p>
            <p>She was pleaſed to find herſelf once more
in the tranquil retirement of the convent,
where ſhe experienced a renewal of all the
maternal kindneſs of the abbeſs, and of the
ſiſterly attentions of the nuns. A report of
the late extraordinary occurrence at the
chateau had already reached them, and, after
ſupper, on the evening of her arrival, it was
the ſubject of converſation in the convent
parlour, where ſhe was requeſted to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſome particulars of that unaccountable
event. Emily was guarded in her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0247300304:147"/>
on this ſubject, and briefly related a
few circumſtances concerning Ludovico,
whoſe diſappearance, her auditors almoſt
unanimouſly agreed, had been effected by
ſupernatural means.</p>
            <p>"A belief had ſo long prevailed," ſaid a
nun, who was called ſiſter Frances, "that the
chateau was haunted, that I was ſurpriſed,
when I heard the Count had the temerity to
inhabit it. Its former poſſeſſor, I fear, had
ſome deed of conſcience to atone for; let us
hope, that the virtues of its preſent owner
will preſerve him from the puniſhment due
to the errors of the laſt, if, indeed, he was
criminal."</p>
            <p>"Of what crime, then, was he ſuſpected?"
ſaid a Mademoiſelle Feydeau, a boarder at
the convent.</p>
            <p>"Let us pray for his ſoul!" ſaid a nun,
who had till now ſat in ſilent attention.
"If he was criminal, his puniſhment in
this world was ſufficient."</p>
            <p>There was a mixture of wildneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
in her manner of delivering this,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0247300304:148"/>
which ſtruck Emily exceedingly; but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle
repeated her queſtion, without
noticing the ſolemn eagerneſs of the nun.</p>
            <p>"I dare not preſume to ſay what was his
crime," replied ſiſter Frances; "but I have
heard many reports of an extraordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
reſpecting the late Marquis de Villeroi,
and among others, that, ſoon after the death
of his lady, he quitted Chateau-le-Blanc,
and never afterwards returned to it. I was
not here at the time, ſo I can only mention
it from report, and ſo many years have
paſſed ſince the Marchioneſs died, that few
of our ſiſterhood, I believe, can do more."</p>
            <p>"But I can," ſaid the nun, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpoke, and whom they called ſiſter
Agnes.</p>
            <p>"You then," ſaid Mademoiſelle Fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau,
"are poſſibly acquainted with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
that enable you to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was criminal or not, and what was
the crime imputed to him."</p>
            <p>"I am," replied the nun; "but who
ſhall dare to ſcrutinize my thoughts—who
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0247300304:149"/>
ſhall dare to pluck out my opinion? God
only is his judge, and to that judge he is
gone!"</p>
            <p>Emily looked with ſurpriſe at ſiſter
Frances, who returned her a ſignificant
glance."</p>
            <p>"I only requeſted your opinion," ſaid
Mademoiſelle Feydeau, mildly; "if the
ſubject; is diſpleaſing to you, I will drop it."</p>
            <p>"Diſpleaſing!"—ſaid the nun, with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis.—"We
are idle talkers; we do not
weigh the meaning of the words we uſe;
<hi>diſpleaſing</hi> is a poor word. I will go pray."
As ſhe ſaid this ſhe roſe from her ſeat, and
with a profound ſigh quitted the room.</p>
            <p>"What can be the meaning of this?"
ſaid Emily, when ſhe was gone.</p>
            <p>"It is nothing extraordinary," replied ſiſter
Frances, "ſhe is often thus; but ſhe has no
meaning in what ſhe ſays. Her intellects
are at times deranged. Did you never ſee
her thus before?"</p>
            <p>"Never," ſaid Emily. "I have, indeed,
Sometimes, thought, that there was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0247300304:150"/>
of madneſs in her look, but never
before perceived it in her ſpeech. Poor
ſoul, I will pray for her!"</p>
            <p>"Your prayers then, my daughter, will
unite with burs," obſerved the lady abbeſs,
"ſhe has need of them."</p>
            <p>"Dear lady," ſaid Mademoiſelle Fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau,
addreſſing the abbeſs, "what is your
opinion of the late Marquis? The ſtrange
circumſtances, that have occurred at the
chateau, have ſo much awakened my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
that I ſhall be pardoned the queſtion.
What was his imputed crime, and what the
puniſhment, to which ſiſter Agnes alluded?"</p>
            <p>"We muſt be cautious of advancing our
opinion," ſaid the abbeſs, with an air of
reſerve, mingled with ſolemnity, "we muſt
be cautious of advancing our opinion on ſo
delicate a ſubject. I will not take upon me
to pronounce, that the late Marquis was
criminal, or to ſay what was the crime of
which he was ſuſpected; but, concerning
the puniſhment our daughter Agnes hinted,
I know of none he ſuffered. She probably
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0247300304:151"/>
alluded to the ſevere one, which an exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
conſcience can inflict. Beware, my
children, of incurring ſo terrible a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—it
is the purgatory of this life!
The late Marchioneſs I knew well; ſhe was
a pattern to ſuch as live in the world; nay,
our ſacred order need not have bluſhed to
copy her virtues! Our holy convent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her mortal part; her heavenly ſpirit,
I doubt not, aſcended to its ſanctuary!"</p>
            <p>As the abbeſs ſpoke this, the laſt bell of
veſpers ſtruck up, and ſhe roſe. "Let us
go, my children," ſaid ſhe, "and intercede
for the wretched; let us go and confeſs our
ſins, and endeavour to purify our ſouls for
the heaven, to which <hi>ſhe</hi> is gone!"</p>
            <p>Emily was affected by the ſolemnity of
this exhortation, and, remembering her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
"The heaven, to which <hi>he,</hi> too, is
gone!" ſaid ſhe, faintly, as ſhe ſuppreſſed
her ſighs, and followed the abbeſs and the
nuns to the chapel.</p>

            <p>COUNT DE VILLEFORT, at length, received
a letter from the advocate at Avignon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Emily to aſſert her claim to the
eſtates of the late Madame Montoni; and,
about the ſame time, a meſſenger arrived
from Monſieur Queſnel with intelligence,
that made an appeal to the law on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unneceſſary, ſince it appeared, that the
only perſon, who could have oppoſed her
claim, was now no more. A friend of M.
Queſnel, who reſided at Venice, had ſent
him an account of the death of Montoni,
who had been brought to trial with Orſino,
as his ſuppoſed accomplice in the murder
of the Venetian nobleman. Orſino was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0247300304:153"/>
found guilty, condemned and executed upon
the wheel, but, nothing being diſcovered to
criminate Montoni, and his colleagues, on
this charge, they were all releaſed, except.
Montoni, who, being conſidered by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as a very dangerous perſon, was, for
other reaſons, ordered again into confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where, it was ſaid, he had died in a
doubtful and myſterious manner, and not
without ſuſpicion of having been poiſoned.
The authority, from which M. Queſnel
had received this information, would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to doubt its truth, and he told
Emily, that ſhe had now only to lay claim
to the eſtates of her late aunt, to ſecure
them, and added, that he would himſelf aſſiſt
in the neceſſary forms of this buſineſs. The
term, for which La Vallée had been let being
now alſo nearly expired, he acquainted her
with the circumſtance, and adviſed her to
take the road thither, through Tholouſe,
where he promiſed to meet her, and where it
would be proper for her to take poſſeſſion
of the eſtates, of the late Madame Montoni;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0247300304:154"/>
adding, that he would ſpare her any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
that might occur on that occaſion
from the want of knowledge on the ſubject,
and that he believed it would be neceſſary
for her to be at Tholouſe, in about three
weeks from the preſent time.</p>
            <p>An increaſe of fortune ſeemed to have
awakened this ſudden kindneſs in M. Queſnel
towards his niece, and it appeared, that he
entertained more reſpect for the rich heireſs,
than he had ever felt compaſſion for the
poor and unfriended orphan.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure, with which ſhe received
this intelligence, was clouded when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that he, for whoſe ſake ſhe had once
regretted the want of fortune, was no longer
worthy of ſharing it with her; but, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
the friendly admonition of the Count,
ſhe checked this melancholy reflection, and
endeavoured to feel only gratitude for the
unexpected good, that now attended her;
while it formed no inconſiderable part of her
ſatisfaction to know, that La Vallée, her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
home, which was endeared to her by it's
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0247300304:155"/>
having been the reſidence of her parents,
would ſoon be reſtored to her poſſeſſion.
There ſhe meant to fix her future reſidence,
for, though it could not be compared with
the chateau at Tholouſe, either for extent,
or magnificence, its pleaſant ſcenes and the
tender remembrances, that haunted them,
had claims upon her heart, which ſhe was
not inclined to ſacrifice to oſtentation. She
wrote immediately to thank M. Queſnel for
the active intereſt he took in her concerns,
and to ſay, that ſhe would meet him at Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe
at the appointed time.</p>
            <p>When Count de Villefort, with Blanche,
came to the convent to give Emily the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the advocate, he was informed of the
contents of M. Queſnel's letter, and gave
her his ſincere congratulations, on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but ſhe obſerved, that, when the firſt
expreſſion of ſatisfaction had faded from his
countenance, an unuſual gravity ſucceeded,
and ſhe ſcarcely heſitated to enquire its
cauſe.</p>
            <p>"It has no new occaſion," replied the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0247300304:156"/>
Count; "I am haraſſed and perplexed by
the confuſion, into which my family is
thrown by their fooliſh ſuperſtition. Idle
reports are floating round me, which I can
neither admit to be true, or prove to be
falſe; and I am, alſo, very anxious about
the poor fellow, Ludovico, concerning whom
I have not been able to obtain information.
Every part of the chateau and every part of
the neighbourhood, too, has, I believe, been
ſearched, and I know not what further can
be done, ſince I have already offered large
rewards for the diſcovery of him. The keys
of the north apartment I have not ſuffered
to be out of my poſſeſſion, ſince he diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and I mean to watch in thoſe
chambers, myſelf, this very night."</p>
            <p>Emily, ſeriouſly alarmed for the Count,
united her entreaties with thoſe of the Lady
Blanche, to diſſuade him from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>"What ſhould I fear?" ſaid he. "I
have no faith in ſupernatural combats, and
for human oppoſition I ſhall be prepared;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0247300304:157"/>
nay, I will even promiſe not to watch
alone."</p>
            <p>"But who, dear ſir, will have courage
enough to watch with you?" ſaid Emily.</p>
            <p>"My ſon," replied the Count. "If I
am not carried off in the night," added he,
ſmiling, "you ſhall hear the reſult of my
adventure, to-morrow."</p>
            <p>The Count and Lady Blanche, ſhortly
afterwards, took leave of Emily, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the chateau, where he informed
Henri of his intention, who, not without
ſome ſecret reluctance, conſented to be the
partner of his watch; and, when the deſign
was mentioned after ſupper, the Counteſs
was terrified, and the Baron, and M. Du
Pont joined with her in entreating, that
he would not tempt his fate, as Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico
had done. "We know not," added
the Baron, "the nature, or the power of an
evil ſpirit; and that ſuch a ſpirit haunts thoſe
chambers can now, I think, ſcarcely be
doubted. Beware, my lord, how you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
its vengeance, ſince it has already
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0247300304:158"/>
given us one terrible example of its malice.
I allow it may be probable, that the ſpirits
of the dead are permitted to return to the
earth only on occaſions of high import; but
the preſent import may be your deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
            <p>The Count could not forbear ſmiling;
"Do you think then, Baron," ſaid he, "that
my deſtruction is of ſufficient importance to
draw back to earth the ſoul of the departed?
Alas! my good friend, there is no occaſion
for ſuch means to accompliſh the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any individual. Wherever the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
reſts, I truſt I ſhall, this night, be able
to detect it. You know I am not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious."</p>
            <p>"I know that you are incredulous," in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the Baron.</p>
            <p>"Well, call it what you will, I meant to
ſay, that, though you know I am free from
ſuperſtition—if any thing ſupernatural has
appeared, I doubt not it will appear to me,
and if any ſtrange event hangs over my
houſe, or if any extraordinary tranſaction
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0247300304:159"/>
has formerly been connected with it, I ſhall
probably be made acquainted with it. At
all events I will invite diſcovery; and, that
I may be equal to a mortal attack, which
in good truth, my friend, is what I moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
I ſhall take care to be well armed."</p>
            <p>The Count took leave of his family, for
the night, with an aſſumed gaiety, which but
ill concealed the anxiety, that depreſſed his
ſpirits, and retired to the north apartments,
accompanied by his ſon and followed by the
Baron, M. Du Pont and ſome of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics,
who all bade him good night at the
outer door. In theſe chambers every thing
appeared as when he had laſt been here;
even in the bed-room no alteration was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
where he lighted his own fire, for none
of the domeſtics could be prevailed upon to
venture thither. After carefully examining
the chamber and the oriel, the Count and
Henri drew their chairs upon the hearth, ſet
a bottle of wine and a lamp before them, laid
their ſwords upon the table, and, ſtirring
the wood into a blaze, began to converſe on
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0247300304:160"/>
indifferent topics. But Henri was often
ſilent and abſtracted, and ſometimes threw
a glance of mingled awe and curioſity round
the gloomy apartment; while the Count
gradually ceaſed to converſe, and ſat either
loſt in thought, or reading a volume of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,
which he had brought to beguile the
tediouſneſs of the night.</p>

            <p>THE Baron St. Foix, whom anxiety for
his friend had kept awake, roſe early to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the event of the night, when, as he
paſſed the Count's cloſet, hearing ſteps
within, he knocked at the door, and it was
opened by his friend himſelf. Rejoicing to
ſee him in ſafety, and curious to learn the
occurrences of the night, he had not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
leiſure to obſerve the unuſual gravity,
that overſpread the features of the Count,
whoſe reſerved anſwers firſt occaſioned him
to notice it. The Count, then ſmiling, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to treat the ſubject of his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
with levity; but the Baron was ſerious,
and purſued his enquiries ſo cloſely, that
the Count, at length, reſuming his gravity,
ſaid, "Well, my friend, preſs the ſubject
no further, I entreat you; and let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0247300304:162"/>
alſo, that you will hereafter be ſilent
upon any thing you may think extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in my future conduct. I do not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to tell you, that I am unhappy, and that
the watch of the laſt night has not aſſiſted
me to diſcover Ludovico; upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the night you muſt excuſe my
reſerve."</p>
            <p>"But where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is Henri?" ſaid the Baron,
with ſurpriſe and diſappointment at this
denial.</p>
            <p>"He is well in his own apartment," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Count. "You will not queſtion
him on this topic, my friend, ſince you know
my wiſh."</p>
            <p>"Certainly not," ſaid the Baron, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
chagrined, "ſince it would be diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you; but methinks, my friend, you
might rely on my diſcretion, and drop this
unuſual reſerve. However, you muſt allow
me to ſuſpect, that you have ſeen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to become a convert to my ſyſtem, and
are no longer the incredulous knight you
lately appeared to be."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0247300304:163"/>
"Let us talk no more upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,"
ſaid the Count; "you may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that no ordinary circumſtance has
impoſed this ſilence upon me towards a
friend, whom I have called ſo for near thirty
years; and my preſent reſerve cannot make
you queſtion either my eſteem, or the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of my friendſhip."</p>
            <p>"I will not doubt either," ſaid the Baron,
"though you muſt allow me to expreſs my
ſurpriſe, at this ſilence."</p>
            <p>"To me I will allow it," replied the
Count, "but I earneſtly entreat that you
will forbear to notice it to my family, as
well as every thing remarkable you may
obſerve in my conduct towards them."</p>
            <p>The Baron readily promiſed this, and,
after converſing for ſome time on general
topics, they deſcended to the breakfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
where the Count met his family with
a cheerful countenance, and evaded their
enquiries by employing light ridicule, and
aſſuming an air of uncommon gaiety, while
he aſſured them, that they need not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0247300304:164"/>
any evil from the north chambers,
ſince Henri and himſelf had been permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to return from them in ſafety.</p>
            <p>Henri, however, was leſs ſucceſsful in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing
his feelings. From his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
an expreſſion of terror was not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faded; he was often ſilent and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and, when he attempted to laugh at the
eager enquiries of mademoiſelle Bearn, it
was evidently only an attempt.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the Count called, as he
had promiſed, at the convent, and Emily
was ſurprifed to perceive a mixture of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ridicule and of reſerve in his mention
of the north apartment. Of what had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
there, however, he ſaid nothing, and,
when ſhe ventured to remind him of his
promiſe to tell her the reſult of his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and to aſk if he had received any
proof, that thoſe chambers were haunted, his
look became ſolemn, for a moment, then,
ſeeming to recollect himſelf, he ſmiled, and
ſaid, "My dear Emily, do not ſuffer my
lady abbeſs to infect your good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0247300304:165"/>
with theſe fancies; ſhe will teach you
to expect a ghoſt in every dark room. But
believe me," added he, with a profound
ſigh, "the apparition of the dead comes
not on light, or ſportive errands, to terrify,
or to ſurpriſe the timid." He pauſed, and
fell into a momentary thoughtfulneſs, and
then added, "We will ſay no more on this
ſubject."</p>
            <p>Soon after, he took leave, and, when
Emily joined ſome of the nuns, ſhe was
ſurpriſed to find them acquainted with a
circumſtance, which ſhe had carefully
avoided to mention, and expreſſing their
admiration of his intrepidity in having dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to paſs a night in the apartment, whence
Ludovico had diſappeared; for ſhe had not
conſidered with what rapidity a tale of
wonder circulates. The nuns had acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their information from peaſants, who
brought fruit to the monaſtery, and whoſe
whole attention had been fixed, ſince the
diſappearance of Ludovico, on what was
paſſing in the caſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0247300304:166"/>
Emily liſtened in ſilence to the various
opinions of the nuns, concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Count, moſt of whom condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it as raſh and preſumptuous, affirming,
that it was provoking the vengeance of an
evil ſpirit, thus to intrude upon its haunts.</p>
            <p>Siſter Frances contended, that the Count
had acted with the bravery of a virtuous
mind. He knew himſelf guiltleſs of aught,
that ſhould provoke a good ſpirit, and did
not fear the ſpells of an evil one, ſince he
could claim the protection of an higher
Power, of Him, who can command the
wicked, and will protect the innocent.</p>
            <p>"The guilty cannot claim that protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!"
ſaid ſiſter Agnes, "let the Count
look to his conduct, that he do not forfeit
his claim! Yet who is he, that ſhall dare
to call himſelf innocent!—all earthly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
is but comparative. Yet ſtill how
wide aſunder are the extremes of guilt, and
to what an horrible depth may we fall!
Oh!"—</p>
            <p>The nun, as ſhe concluded, uttered a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0247300304:167"/>
ſhuddering ſigh, that ſtartled Emily, Who,
looking up, perceived the eyes of Agnes
fixed on hers; after which the ſiſter roſe,
took her hand, gazed earneſtly upon her
countenance, for ſome moments, in ſilence,
and then ſaid,</p>
            <p>"You are young—you are innocent!
I mean you are yet innocent of any great
crime!—But you have paſſions in your
heart,—ſcorpions; they ſleep now—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how you awaken them!—they will
ſting you, even unto death!"</p>
            <p>Emily, affected by theſe words and by
the ſolemnity, with which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
could not ſuppreſs her tears.</p>
            <p>"Ah! is it ſo?" exclaimed Agnes, her
countenance ſoftening from its ſternneſs—"ſo
young, and ſo unfortunate! We are
ſiſters, then indeed. Yet, there is no bond
of kindneſs among the guilty," ſhe added,
while her eyes reſumed their wild expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
"no gentleneſs,—no peace, no hope!
I knew them all once—my eyes could
weep—but now they burn, for now, my
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0247300304:168"/>
ſoul is fixed, and fearleſs!—I lament no
more!"</p>
            <p>"Rather let us repent, and pray," ſaid
another nun. "We are taught to hope,
that prayer and penitence will work our
ſalvation. There is hope for all who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent!"</p>
            <p>"Who repent and turn to the true
faith," obſerved ſiſter Frances.</p>
            <p>"For all but me!" replied Agnes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
who pauſed, and then abruptly
added, "My head burns, I believe I am
not well. O! could I ſtrike from my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
all former ſcenes—the figures, that
riſe up, like furies, to torment me!—I ſee
them, when I ſleep, and, when I am awake,
they are ſtill before my eyes! I ſee them
now—now!</p>
            <p>She ſtood, in a fixed attitude of horror,
her ſtraining eyes moving ſlowly round the
room, as if they followed ſomething. One
of the huns gently took her hand, to lead
her from the parlour. Agnes became calm,
drew her other hand acroſs her eyes, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0247300304:169"/>
again, and, ſighing deeply, ſaid, "They
are gone—they are gone! I am feveriſh, I
know not what I ſay. I am thus, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
but it will go off again, I ſhall ſoon
be better. Was not that the veſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied Frances, "the evening
ſervice is paſſed. Let Margaret lead you
to your cell."</p>
            <p>"You are right," replied ſiſter Agnes,
"I ſhall be better there. Good night, my
ſiſters, remember me in your oriſons!"</p>
            <p>When they had withdrawn, Frances, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
Emily's emotion, ſaid, "Do not be
alarmed, our ſiſter is often thus deranged,
though I have not lately ſeen her ſo fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic;
her uſual mood is melancholy. This
fit has been coming on, for ſeveral days;
ſecluſion and the cuſtomary treatment will
reſtore her."</p>
            <p>"But how rationally she converſed, at
firſt!" obſerved Emily," "her ideas fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
each other in perfect order."</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied the nun, "this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0247300304:170"/>
new; nay, I have ſometimes known
her argue not only with method, but with
acuteneſs, and then, in a moment, ſtart off
into madneſs."</p>
            <p>"Her conſcience ſeems afflicted," ſaid
Emily, "did you ever hear what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
reduced her to this deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?"</p>
            <p>"I have," replied the nun, who ſaid no
more till Emily repeated the queſtion, when
ſhe added in a low voice, and looking ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly
towards the other boarders, "I
cannot tell you now, but, if you think it
worth your while, come to my cell, to-night,
when our ſiſterhood are at reſt, and you
ſhall hear more; but remember we riſe to
midnight prayers, and come either before,
or after midnight."</p>
            <p>Emily promiſed to remember, and, the
abbeſs ſoon after appearing, they ſpoke no
more of the unhappy nun.</p>
            <p>The Count, meanwhile, on his return
home, had found M. Du Pont in one of
thoſe fits of deſpondency, which his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0247300304:171"/>
to Emily frequently occaſioned him,
an attachment, that had ſubſiſted too long
to be eaſily ſubdued, and which had already
outlived the oppoſition of his friends. M.
Du Pont had firſt ſeen Emily in Gaſcony,
during the lifetime of his parent, who, on
diſcovering his ſon's partiality for mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle
St. Aubert, his inferior in point of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
forbade him to declare it to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
or to think of her more. During the
life of his father, he had obſerved the firſt
command, but had found it impracticable
to obey the ſecond, and had, ſometimes,
ſoothed his paſſion by viſiting her favourite
haunts, among which was the fiſhing-houſe,
where, once or twice, he addreſſed her in
verſe, concealing his name, in obedience to
the promiſe he had given his father. There
too he played the pathetic air, to which ſhe
had liſtened with ſuch ſurpriſe and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and there he found the miniature, that
had ſince cheriſhed a paſſion fatal to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
During his expedition into Italy, his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0247300304:172"/>
father died; but he received his liberty at a
moment, when he was the leaſt enabled to
profit by it, ſince the object, that rendered
it moſt valuable, was no longer within the
reach of his vows. By what accident he
diſcovered Emily, and aſſiſted to releaſe her
from a terrible impriſonment, has already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and alſo the unavailing hope, with
which he then encouraged his love, and the
fruitleſs efforts, that he had ſince made to
overcome it.</p>
            <p>The Count ſtill endeavoured, with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
zeal, to ſooth him with a belief, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
perſeverance and prudence would
finally obtain for him happineſs and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
"Time," ſaid he, "will wear away
the melancholy impreſſion, which diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
has left on her mind, and ſhe
will be ſenſible of your merit. Your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
have already awakened her gratitude,
and your ſufferings her pity; and truſt me,
my friend, in a heart ſo ſenſible as hers,
gratitude and pity lead to love. When her
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0247300304:173"/>
imagination is reſcued from its preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
ſhe will readily accept the homage
of a mind like yours."</p>
            <p>Du Pont ſighed, while he liſtened to theſe
words; and, endeavouring to hope what his
friend believed, he willingly yielded to an
invitation to prolong his viſit at the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
which we now leave for the monaſtery
of St. Claire.</p>
            <p>When the nuns had retired to reſt, Emily
ſtole to her appointment with ſiſter Frances,
whom ſhe found in her cell, engaged in
prayer, before a little table, where appeared
the image ſhe was addreſſing, and, above,
the dim lamp, that gave light to the place.
Turning her eyes, as the door opened, ſhe
beckoned to Emily to come in, who, having
done ſo, ſeated herſelf in ſilence beſide the
nun's little mattreſs of ſtraw, till her oriſons
ſhould conclude. The latter ſoon roſe from
her knees, and, taking down the lamp and
placing it on the table, Emily perceived there
a human ſcull and bones, lying beſide an
hour-glaſs; but the nun, without obſerving
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0247300304:174"/>
her emotion, ſat down on the mattreſs by
her, ſaying, "Your curioſity, ſiſter, has
made you punctual, but you have nothing
remarkable to hear in the hiſtory of poor
Agnes, of whom I avoided to ſpeak in the
preſence of my lay-ſiſters, only becauſe I
would not publiſh her crime to them."</p>
            <p>"I ſhall conſider your confidence in me
as a favour," ſaid Emily, "and will not
miſuſe it."</p>
            <p>"Siſter Agnes," reſumed the nun, "is
of a noble family, as the dignity of her air
muſt already have informed you, but I will
not diſhonour their name ſo much as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
it. Love was the occaſion of her crime
and of her madneſs. She was beloved by a
gentleman of inferior fortune, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as I have heard, beſtowing her on a
nobleman, whom ſhe diſliked, an ill-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
paſſion proved her deſtruction.—Every
obligation of virtue and of duty was
forgotten, and ſhe prophaned her marriage
vows; but her guilt was ſoon detected, and
ſhe would have fallen a ſacrifice to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0247300304:175"/>
of her huſband, had not her father
contrived to convey her from his power. By
what means he did this, I never could learn;
but he ſecreted her in this convent, where he
afterwards prevailed with her to take the
veil, while a report was circulated in the
world, that ſhe was dead, and the father, to
ſave his daughter, aſſiſted the rumour, and
employed ſuch means as induced her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to believe ſhe had become a victim to
his jealouſy. You look ſurpriſed," added
the nun, obſerving Emily's countenance;
"I allow the ſtory is uncommon, but not, I
believe, without a parallel."</p>
            <p>"Pray proceed," ſaid Emily, "I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted."</p>
            <p>"The ſtory is already told," reſumed the
nun, "I have only to mention that the
long ſtruggle, which Agnes ſuffered, between
love, remorſe and a ſenſe of the duties ſhe
had taken upon herſelf in becoming of our
order, at length unſettled her reaſon. At firſt,
ſhe was frantic and melancholy by quick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatives;
then, ſhe ſunk into a deep and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0247300304:176"/>
ſettled melancholy, which ſtill, however,
has, at times, been interrupted by fits of
wildneſs, and, of late, theſe have again been
frequent."</p>
            <p>Emily was affected by the hiſtory of the
ſiſter, ſome parts of whoſe ſtory brought to
her remembrance that of the Marchioneſs
de Villeroi, who had alſo been compelled by
her father to forſake the object of her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for a nobleman of his choice; but, from
what Dorothée had related, there appeared
no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that ſhe had eſcaped
the vengeance of a jealous huſband, or to
doubt for a moment the innocence of her
conduct. But Emily, while ſhe ſighed over
the miſery of the nun, could not forbear
ſhedding a few tears to the misfortunes of
the Marchioneſs; and, when ſhe returned to
the mention of ſiſter Agnes, ſhe aſked Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
if ſhe remembered her in her youth, and
whether ſhe was then beautiful.</p>
            <p>"I was not here at the time, when ſhe
took the vows," replied Frances, "which is
ſo long ago, that few of the preſent ſiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0247300304:177"/>
I believe, were witneſſes of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
nay, even our lady mother did not
then preſide over the convent: but I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
when ſiſter Agnes was a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
woman. She retains that air of high
rank, which always diſtinguiſhed her, but
her beauty, you muſt perceive, is fled; I
can ſcarcely diſcover even a veſtige of the
lovelineſs, that once animated her features."</p>
            <p>"It is ſtrange," ſaid Emily, "but there
are moments, when her countenance has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
familiar to my memory! You will
think me-fanciful, and I think myſelf ſo, for
I certainly never ſaw ſiſter Agnes, before I
came to this convent, and I muſt, therefore,
have ſeen ſome perſon, whom ſhe ſtrongly
reſembles, though of this I have no recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection."</p>
            <p>"You have been intereſted by the deep
melancholy of her countenance," ſaid Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
"and its impreſſion has probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
your imagination; for I might as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
think I perceive a likeneſs between
you and Agnes, as you, that you have ſeen
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0247300304:178"/>
her any where but in this convent, ſince this
has been her place of refuge, for nearly as
many years as make your age."</p>
            <p>"Indeed!" ſaid Emily.</p>
            <p>"Yes," rejoined Frances, "and why
does that circumſtance excite your ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe?"</p>
            <p>Emily did not appear to notice this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but remained thoughtful, for a few
moments, and then ſaid, "It was about that
ſame period that the Marchioneſs de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roi
expired."</p>
            <p>"That is an odd remark," ſaid Frances.</p>
            <p>Emily, recalled from her reverie, ſmiled,
and gave the converſation another turn, but
it ſoon came back to the ſubject of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
nun, and Emily remained in the cell
of ſiſter Frances, till the mid-night bell
arouſed her; when, apologizing for having
interrupted the ſiſter's repoſe, till this late
hour, they quitted the cell together. Emily
returned to her chamber, and the nun,
bearing a glimmering taper, went to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
in the-chapel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0247300304:179"/>
Several days followed, during which Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaw neither the Count, or any of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
and, when, at length, he appeared,
ſhe remarked, with concern, that his air was
unuſually diſturbed.</p>
            <p>"My ſpirits are haraſſed," ſaid he, in
anſwer to her anxious enquiries, "and I
mean to change my reſidence, for a little
while, an experiment, which, I hope, will
reſtore my mind to its uſual tranquillity.
My daughter and myſelf will accompany
the Baron St. Foix to his chateau. It lies
in a valley of the Pyrenées, that opens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Gaſcony, and I have been thinking,
Emily, that, when you ſet out for La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lée,
we may go part of the way together; it
would be a ſatisfaction to me to guard you
towards your home.</p>
            <p>She thanked the Count for his friendly
conſideration, and lamented, that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
for her going firſt to Tholouſe would
render this plan impracticable, "But, when
you are at the Baron's reſidence," ſhe added,
"you will be only a ſhort journey from La
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0247300304:180"/>
Vallée, and I think, ſir, you will not leave
the country without viſiting me; it is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſay with what pleaſure I ſhould
receive you and the Lady Blanche."</p>
            <p>"I do not doubt it," replied the Count,
"and I will not deny myſelf and Blanche
the pleaſure of viſiting you, if your affairs
ſhould allow you to be at La Vallée, about
the time when we can meet you there."</p>
            <p>When Emily ſaid that ſhe ſhould hope to
ſee the Counteſs alſo, ſhe was not ſorry to
learn that this lady was going, accompanied
by Mademoiſelle Bearn, to pay a viſit, for a
few weeks, to a family in lower Languedoc.</p>
            <p>The Count, after ſome further converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on his intended journey and on the
arrangement of Emily's, took leave; and
many days did not ſucceed this viſit, before
a ſecond letter from M. Queſnel informed
her, that he was then at Tholouſe, that La
Vallée was at liberty, and that he wiſhed
her to ſet off for the former place, where he
awaited her arrival, with all poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
ſince his own affairs preſſed him to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0247300304:181"/>
return to Gaſcony. Emily did not heſitate
to obey him, and, having taken an affecting
leave of the Count's family, in which M.
Du Pont was ſtill included, and of her
friends at the convent, ſhe ſet out for Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,
attended by the unhappy Annette,
and guarded by a ſteady ſervant of the
Count.</p>

            <p>EMILY purſued her journey, without
any accident, along the plains of Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc
towards the north-weſt; and, on this
her return to Tholouſe, which ſhe had laſt
left with Madame Montoni, ſhe thought
much on the melancholy fate of her aunt,
who, but for her own imprudence, might now
have been living in happineſs there! Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni,
too, often roſe to her fancy, ſuch as
ſhe had ſeen him in his days of triumph,
bold, ſpirited and commanding; ſuch alſo
as ſhe had ſince beheld him in his days of
vengeance; and now, only a few ſhort
months had paſſed—and he had no longer
the power, or the will to afflict;—he had become
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0247300304:183"/>
come a clod of earth, and his life was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
like a ſhadow! Emily could have
wept at his fate, had ſhe not remembered
his crimes; for that of her unfortunate aunt
ſhe did weep, and all ſenſe of her errors was
overcome by the recollection of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>Other thoughts and other emotions ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
as Emily drew near the well-known
ſcenes of her early love, and conſidered, that
Valancourt was loſt to her and to himſelf,
for ever. At length, ſhe came to the brow
of the hill, whence, on her departure for
Italy, ſhe had given a farewell look to this
beloved landſcape, amongſt whoſe woods and
fields ſhe had ſo often walked with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
and where he was then to inhabit,
when ſhe would be far, far away! She ſaw,
once more, that chain of the Pyrenées, which
overlooked La Vallée, riſing, like faint
clouds, on the horizon. "There, too, is
Gaſcony, extended at their feet!" ſaid ſhe,
"O my father,—my mother! And there,
too, is the Garonne!" ſhe added, drying
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0247300304:184"/>
the tears, that obſcured her ſight,—" and
Tholouſe, and my aunt's manſion—and the
groves in her garden!—O my friends! are
ye all loſt to me—muſt I never, never ſee
ye more!" Tears ruſhed again to her eyes,
and. ſhe continued to weep, till an abrupt
turn in the road had nearly occaſioned the
carriage to overſet, when, looking up, ſhe
perceived another part of the well-known
ſcene around Tholouſe, and all the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and anticipations, which ſhe had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
at the moment, when ſhe bade it laſt
adieu, came with recollected force to her
heart. She remembered how anxiouſly ſhe
had looked forward to the futurity, which
was to decide her happineſs concerning Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
and what depreſſing fears had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed
her; the very words ſhe had uttered,
as ſhe withdrew her laſt look from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
came to her memory. "Could I but
be certain," ſhe had then ſaid, "that I
ſhould ever return, and that Valancourt
would ſtill live for me—I ſhould go in
peace!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0247300304:185"/>
Now, that futurity, ſo anxiouſly antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
was arrived, ſhe was returned—but
what a dreary blank appeared!—Valancourt
no longer lived for her! She had no longer
even the melancholy ſatisfaction of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
his image in her heart, for he was
no longer the ſame Valancourt ſhe had
cheriſhed there—the ſolace of many a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hour, the animating friend, that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
her to bear up againſt the oppreſſion
of Montoni—the diſtant hope, that had
beamed over her gloomy proſpect! On per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this beloved idea to be an illuſion of
her own creation, Valancourt ſeemed to be
annihilated, and her ſoul ſickened at the
blank, that remained. His marriage with
a rival, even his death, ſhe thought ſhe
could have endured with more fortitude,
than this diſcovery; for then, amidſt all her
grief, ſhe could have looked in ſecret upon
the image of goodneſs, which her fancy had
drawn of him, and comfort would have
mingled with her ſuffering!</p>
            <p>Drying her tears, ſhe looked, once more,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0247300304:186"/>
upon the landſcape, which had excited them,
and perceived, that ſhe was paſſing the very
bank, where ſhe had taken leave of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
on the morning of her departure from
Tholouſe, and ſhe now ſaw him, through her
returning tears, ſuch as he had appeared,
when ſhe looked from the carriage to give
him a laſt adieu—ſaw him leaning mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
againſt the high trees, and remembered
the fixed look of mingled tenderneſs and
anguiſh, with which he had then regarded
her. This recollection was too much for
her heart, and ſhe ſunk back in the carriage,
nor once looked up, till it ſtopped at the
gates of what was now her own manſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe being opened, and by the ſervant,
to whoſe care the chateau had been entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the carriage drove into the court, where,
alighting, ſhe haſtily paſſed through the great
hall, now ſilent and ſolitary, to a large oak
parlour, the common ſitting room of the late
Madame Montoni, where, inſtead of being
received by M. Queſnel, ſhe found a letter
from him, informing her, that buſineſs of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0247300304:187"/>
conſequence had obliged him to leave Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe
two days before. Emily was, upon
the whole, not ſorry to be ſpared his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
ſince his abrupt departure appeared
to indicate the ſame indifference, with which
he had formerly regarded her. This letter
informed her, alſo, of the progreſs he had
made in the ſettlement of her affairs, and
concluded with directions, concerning the
forms of ſome buſineſs, which remained for
her to tranſact. But M. Queſnel's unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
did not long occupy her thoughts,
which returned to the remembrance of the
perſons ſhe had been accuſtomed to ſee in this
manſion, and chiefly of the ill-guided and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Madame Montoni. In the room,
where ſhe now ſat, ſhe had breakfaſted with
her on the morning of their departure for
Italy; and the view of it brought moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
to her recollection all ſhe had herſelf
ſuffered, at that time, and the many gay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
which her aunt had formed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
the journey before her. While
Emily's mind was thus engaged, her eyes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0247300304:188"/>
wandered unconſciouſly to a large window,
that looked upon the garden, and here new
memorials of the paſt ſpoke to her heart,
for ſhe ſaw extended before her the very
avenue, in which ſhe had parted with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
on the eve of her journey; and all
the anxiety, the tender intereſt he had ſhewn,
concerning her future happineſs, his earneſt
remonſtrances againſt her committing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the power of Montoni, and the truth
of his affection, came afreſh to her memory.
At this moment, it appeared almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that Valancourt could have become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of her regard, and ſhe doubted all that
ſhe had lately heard to his diſadvantage, and
even his own words, which had confirmed
Count De Villefort's report of him. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the recollections, which the view of
this avenue occaſioned, ſhe turned abruptly
from the window, and ſunk into a chair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
it, where ſhe ſat, given up to grief, till
the entrance of Annette, with coffee, arouſed
her.</p>
            <p>"Dear madam, how melancholy this place
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0247300304:189"/>
looks now," ſaid Annette, "to what it uſed
to do! It is diſmal coming home, when
there is nobody to welcome one!"</p>
            <p>This was not the moment, in which
Emily could bear the remark; her tears fell
again, and, as ſoon as ſhe had taken the
coffee, ſhe retired to her apartment, where
ſhe endeavoured to repoſe. her fatigued ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
But buſy memory would ſtill ſupply
her with the viſions of former times: ſhe
ſaw Valancourt intereſting and benevolent,
as he had been wont to appear in the days
of their early love, and, amidſt the ſcenes,
where ſhe had believed that they ſhould
ſometimes paſs their years together!—but,
at length, ſleep cloſed theſe afflicting ſcenes
from her view.</p>
            <p>On the following morning, ſerious occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
recovered her from ſuch melancholy
reflections; for, being deſirous of quitting
Tholouſe, and of haſtening on to La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,
ſhe made ſome enquiries into the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the eſtate, and immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
a part of the neceſſary buſineſs
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0247300304:190"/>
concerning it, according to the directions of
Monſ. Queſnel. It required a ſtrong effort
to abſtract her thoughts from other intereſts
ſufficiently to attend to this, but ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for her exertions by again experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing,
that employment is the ſureſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
to ſorrow.</p>
            <p>This day was devoted entirely to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and, among other concerns, ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
means to learn the ſituation of all
her poor tenants, that ſhe might relieve
their wants, or confirm their comforts.</p>
            <p>In the evening, her ſpirits were ſo much
ſtrengthened, that ſhe thought ſhe could
bear to viſit the gardens, where ſhe had ſo
often walked with Valancourt; and, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that, if ſhe delayed to do ſo, their
ſcenes would only affect her the more,
whenever they ſhould be viewed, ſhe took
advantage of the preſent ſtate of her mind,
and entered them.</p>
            <p>Paſſing haſtily the gate leading from the
court into the gardens, ſhe hurried up the
great avenue, ſcarcely permitting her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0247300304:191"/>
to dwell for a moment on the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of her having here parted with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
and ſoon quitted this for other walks
leſs intereſting to her heart. Theſe brought
her, at length, to the flight of ſteps, that led
from the lower garden to the terrace, on
ſeeing which, ſhe became agitated, and heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
whether to aſcend, but, her reſolution
returning, ſhe proceeded.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" ſaid Emily, as ſhe aſcended,
"theſe are the ſame high trees, that uſed to
wave over the terrace, and theſe the ſame
flowery thickets—the liburnum, the wild
roſe, and the cerinthe—which were wont to
grow beneath them! Ah! and there, too,
on that bank, are the very plants, which
Valancourt ſo carefully reared!—O when
laſt I ſaw them!"—She checked the thought,
but could not reſtrain her tears, and, after
walking ſlowly on for a few moments, her
agitation, upon the view of this well-known
ſcene, increaſed ſo much, that ſhe was obliged
to ſtop, and lean upon the wall of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race.
It was a mild, and beautiful evening.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0247300304:192"/>
The ſun was ſetting over the extenſive land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
to which his beams, ſloping from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
a dark cloud, that overhung the
weſt, gave rich and partial colouring, and
touched the tufted ſummits of the groves,
that roſe from the garden below, with a
yellow gleam. Emily and Valancourt had
often admired together this ſcene, at the
ſame hour; and it was exactly on this ſpot,
that, on the night preceding her departure
for Italy, ſhe had liſtened to his remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
againſt the journey, and to the
pleadings of paſſionate affection. Some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
which ſhe made on the landſcape,
brought this to her remembrance, and with
it all the minute particulars of that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;—the
alarming doubts he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
concerning Montoni, doubts, which
had ſince been fatally confirmed; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and entreaties he had employed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with her to conſent to an immediate
marriage; the tenderneſs of his love, the
paroxyſms of his grief, and the conviction
he had repeatedly expreſſed, that they ſhould
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0247300304:193"/>
never meet again in happineſs! All theſe
circumſtances roſe afreſh to her mind, and
awakened the various emotions ſhe had then
ſuffered. Her tenderneſs for Valancourt
became as powerful as in the moments,
when ſhe thought, that ſhe was parting with
him and happineſs together, and when the
ſtrength of her mind had enabled her to
triumph over preſent ſuffering, rather than
to deſerve the reproach of her conſcience
by engaging in a clandeſtine marriage.—"Alas!"
ſaid Emily, as theſe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
came to her mind, "and what
have I gained by the fortitude I then prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed?—am
I happy now?—He ſaid, we
ſhould meet no more in happineſs; but, O!
he little thought his own miſconduct would
ſeparate us, and lead to the very evil he
then dreaded!"</p>
            <p>Her reflections increaſed her anguiſh,
while ſhe was compelled to acknowledge,
that the fortitude ſhe had formerly exerted,
if it had not conducted her to happineſs,
had ſaved her from irretrievable misfortune
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0247300304:194"/>
—from Valancourt himſelf! But in theſe
moments ſhe could not congratulate herſelf
on the prudence, that had ſaved her: ſhe
could only lament, with bittereſt anguiſh,
the circumſtances, which had conſpired to
betray Valancourt into a courſe of life ſo
different from that, which the virtues, the
taſte, and the purſuits of his early years
had promiſed; but ſhe ſtill loved him too
well to believe, that his heart was even now
depraved, though his conduct had been cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.
An obſervation, which had fallen
from M. St. Aubert more than once, now
occurred to her. "This young man,"
ſaid he, ſpeaking of Valancourt, "has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been at Paris;" a remark, that had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
her at the time it was uttered, but
which me now underſtood, and ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
ſorrowfully, "O Valancourt! if
ſuch a friend, as my father had been with
you at Paris—your noble, ingenuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would not have fallen,!".</p>
            <p>The ſun was now ſet, and, recalling her
thoughts from their melancholy ſubject, ſhe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0247300304:195"/>
continued her walk; for the penſive ſhade
of twilight was pleaſing to her, and the
nightingales from the ſurrounding groves
began to anſwer each other in the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
plaintive note, which always touched
her heart; while all the fragrance of the
flowery thickets, that bounded the terrace,
was awakened by the cool evening air,
which floated ſo lightly among their leaves,
that they ſcarcely trembled as it paſſed.</p>
            <p>Emily came, at length, to the ſteps of
the pavilion, that terminated the terrace,
and where her laſt interview with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
before her departure from Tholouſe,
had ſo unexpectedly taken place. The
door was now ſhut, and she trembled, while
ſhe heſitated whether to open it; but her
wiſh to ſee again a place, which had been
the chief ſcene of her former happineſs, at
length overcoming her reluctance to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
the painful regret it would renew,
ſhe entered. The room was obſcured by a
melancholy ſhade; but through the open
lattices, darkened by the hanging foliage of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0247300304:196"/>
the vines, appeared the duſky landſcape,
the Garonne reflecting the evening light,
and the weſt ſtill glowing. A chair was
placed near one of the balconies, as if ſome
perſon had been ſitting there, but the other
furniture of the pavilion remained exactly
as uſual, and Emily thought it looked as
if it had not once been moved ſince ſhe ſet
out for Italy. The ſilent and deſerted air
of the place added ſolemnity to her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for ſhe heard only the low whiſper of
the breeze, as it ſhook. the leaves of the
vines, and the very faint murmur of the
Garonne.</p>
            <p>She ſeated herſelf in a chair, near the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and yielded to the ſadneſs of her heart,
while ſhe recollected the circumſtances of
her parting interview with Valancourt, on
this ſpot. It was here too, that ſhe had
paſſed ſome of the happieſt hours of her
life with him, when her aunt favoured the
connection, for here ſhe had often ſat and
worked, while he converſed, or read; and
ſhe now well remembered with what diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0247300304:197"/>
judgment, with what tempered
energy, he uſed to repeat ſome of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt
paſſages of their favourite authors;
how often he would pauſe to admire with
her their excellence, and with what tender
delight he would liſten to her remarks, and
correct her taſte.</p>
            <p>"And is it poſſible," ſaid Emily, as
theſe recollections returned—"is it poſſible,
that a mind, ſo ſuſceptible of whatever is
grand and beautiful, could ſtoop to low
purſuits, and be ſubdued by frivolous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?"</p>
            <p>She remembered how often ſhe had ſeen
the ſudden tear ſtart in his eye, and had
heard his voice tremble with emotion,
while he related any great or benevolent
action, or repeated a ſentiment of the ſame
character. "And ſuch a mind," ſaid ſhe,
"ſuch a heart, were to be ſacrificed to the
habits of a great city!"</p>
            <p>Theſe recollections becoming too painful
to be endured, ſhe abruptly left the pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and, anxious to eſcape from the memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ials
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0247300304:198"/>
of her departed happineſs, returned
towards the chateau. As ſhe paſſed along
the terrace, ſhe perceived a perſon, walking,
with a ſlow ſtep, and a dejected air, under
the trees, at ſome diſtance. The twilight,
which was now deep, would not allow her
to diſtinguiſh who it was, and ſhe imagined
it to be one of the ſervants, till, the ſound
of her ſteps ſeeming to reach him, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
half round, and ſhe thought ſhe ſaw
Valancourt!</p>
            <p>Whoever it was, he inſtantly ſtruck
among the thickets on the left, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
while Emily, her eyes fixed on the
place, whence he had vaniſhed, and her
frame trembling ſo exceſſively, that ſhe
could ſcarcely ſupport herſelf, remained,
for ſome moments, unable to quit the ſpot,
and ſcarcely conſcious of exiſtence. With
her recollection, her ſtrength returned, and
ſhe hurried toward the houſe, where ſhe
did not venture to enquire who had been
in the gardens, leſt ſhe ſhould betray her
emotion; and ſhe ſat down alone, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0247300304:199"/>
to recollect the figure, air and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the perſon ſhe had juſt ſeen. Her
view of him, however, had been ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient,
and the gloom had rendered it ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
that ſhe could remember nothing
with exactneſs; yet the general appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his figure, and his abrupt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
made her ſtill believe, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was Valancourt. Sometimes, indeed,
ſhe thought, that her fancy, which had
been occupied by the idea of him, had
ſuggeſted his image to her uncertain ſight:
but this conjecture was fleeting. If it was
himſelf, whom ſhe had ſeen, ſhe wondered
much, that he ſhould be at Tholouſe, and
more, how he had gained admittance into
the garden; but as often as her impatience
prompted her to enquire whether any ſtranger
had been admitted, ſhe was reſtrained by an
unwillingneſs to betray her doubts; and the
evening was paſſed in anxious conjecture,
and in efforts to diſmiſs the ſubject from
her thoughts. But, theſe endeavours were
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0247300304:200"/>
ineffectual, and a thouſand inconſiſtent
emotions aſſailed her, whenever ſhe fancied
that Valancourt might be near her; now,
ſhe dreaded it to be true, and now ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be falſe; and, while ſhe conſtantly
tried to perſuade herſelf, that ſhe wiſhed
the perſon, whom ſhe had ſeen, might not
be Valancourt, her heart as conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
her reaſon.</p>
            <p>The following day was occupied by the
viſits of ſeveral neighbouring families, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
intimate with Madame Montoni, who
came to condole with Emily on her death,
to congratulate her upon the acquiſition of
theſe eſtates, and to enquire about Montoni,
and concerning the ſtrange reports they had
heard of her own ſituation; all which was
done with the utmoſt decorum, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
departed with as much compoſure as
they had arrived.</p>
            <p>Emily was wearied by theſe formalities,
and diſguſted by the ſubſervient manners of
many perſons, who had thought her ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0247300304:201"/>
worthy of common attention, while ſhe
was believed to be a dependant on Madame
Montoni.</p>
            <p>"Surely," ſaid she, "there is ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic
in wealth, which can thus make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
pay their court to it, when it does not
even benefit themſelves. How ſtrange it
is, that a fool or a knave, with riches,
ſhould be treated with more reſpect by the
world, than a good man, or a wiſe man in
poverty!"</p>
            <p>It was evening, before ſhe was left alone,
and ſhe then wiſhed to have refreſhed her
ſpirits in the free air of her garden; but ſhe
feared to go thither, leſt ſhe ſhould meet
again the perſon, whom ſhe had ſeen on
the preceding night, and he should prove
to be Valancourt. The ſuſpenſe and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety
ſhe ſuffered, on this ſubject, ſhe found
all her efforts unable to controul, and her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
wiſh to ſee Valancourt once more, though
unſeen by him, powerfully prompted her
to go, but prudence and a delicate pride re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0247300304:202"/>
her; and ſhe determined to avoid
the poſſibility of throwing herſelf in his
way, by forbearing to viſit the gardens, for
ſeveral days.</p>
            <p>When, after near a week, ſhe again ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
thither, ſhe made Annette her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and confined her walk to the lower
grounds, but often ſtarted as the leaves
ruſtled in the breeze, imagining, that ſome
perſon was among the thickets; and, at the
turn of every alley, ſhe looked forward
with apprehenſive expectation. She pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
her walk thoughtfully and ſilently,
for her agitation would not ſuffer her to
converſe with Annette, to whom, however,
thought and ſilence were ſo intolerable, that
ſhe did not ſcruple at length to talk to her
miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>"Dear madam," ſaid ſhe, "why do you
ſtart ſo? one would think you knew what
has happened."</p>
            <p>"What has happened?" ſaid Emily, in
a faltering voice, and trying to command
her emotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0247300304:203"/>
"The night before laſt, you know, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam"—</p>
            <p>"I know nothing, Annette," replied
her lady in a more hurried voice.</p>
            <p>"The night before laſt, madam, there
was a robber in the garden."</p>
            <p>"A robber!" ſaid Emily, in an eager,
yet doubting tone.</p>
            <p>"I ſuppoſe he was a robber, madam,
What elſe could he be?"</p>
            <p>"Where did you ſee him, Annette?" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
Emily, looking round her, and
turning back towards the chateau.</p>
            <p>"It was not I that ſaw him, madam,
it was Jean the gardener. It was twelve
o'clock at night, and, as he was coming
acroſs the court to go the back way into
the houſe, what ſhould he ſee—but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
walking in the avenue, that fronts
the garden gate! So, with that, Jean gueſſed
how it was, and he went into the houſe for
his gun."</p>
            <p>"His gun!" exclaimed Emily.</p>
            <p>"Yes, madam, his gun; and then he
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0247300304:204"/>
came out into the court to watch him.
Preſently, he ſees him come ſlowly down
the avenue, and lean over the garden gate,
and look up at the houſe for a long time;
and I warrant he examined it well, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
what window he ſhould break in at."</p>
            <p>"But the gun," ſaid Emily—"the
gun!"</p>
            <p>"Yes, madam, all in good time. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
Jean ſays, the robber opened the
gate, and was coming into the court, and
then he thought proper to aſk him his
buſineſs: ſo he called out again, and bade
him ſay who he was, and what he wanted.
But the man would do neither; but turned
upon his heel, and paſſed into the garden
again. Jean knew then well enough how
it was, and ſo he fired after him."</p>
            <p>"Fired!" exclaimed Emily.</p>
            <p>"Yes, madam, fired off his gun; but,
Holy Virgin! what makes you look ſo
pale, madam? The man was not killed,—I
dare ſay; but if he was, his comrades
carried him off: for, when Jean went in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0247300304:205"/>
morning, to look for the body, it was gone,
and nothing to be ſeen but a track of blood
on the ground. Jean followed it, that he
might find out where the man got into
the garden, but it was loſt in the graſs,
and"—</p>
            <p>Annette was interrupted: for Emily's
ſpirits died away, and ſhe would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
to the ground, if the girl had not
caught her, and ſupported her to a bench,
cloſe to them.</p>
            <p>When, after a long abſence, her ſenſes
returned, Emily deſired to be led to her
apartment; and, though she trembled with
anxiety to enquire further on the ſubject
of her alarm, ſhe found herſelf too ill at
preſent, to dare the intelligence which it
was poſſible ſhe might receive of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.
Having diſmiſſed Annette, that ſhe
might weep and think at liberty, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to recollect the exact air of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whom ſhe had ſeen on the terrace, and
ſtill her fancy gave her the figure of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt.
She had, indeed, ſcarcely a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0247300304:206"/>
doubt, that it was he whom ſhe had ſeen,
and at whom the gardener had fired: for
the manner of the latter perſon, as deſcribed
by Annette, was not that of a robber; nor
did it appear probable, that a robber would
have come alone, to break into a houſe ſo
ſpacious as this.</p>
            <p>When Emily thought herſelf ſufficiently
recovered, to liſten to what Jean might
have to relate, ſhe ſent for him; but be
could inform her of no circumſtance, that
might lead to a knowledge of the perſon,
who had been ſhot, or of the conſequence
of the wound; and, after ſeverely repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him, for having fired with bullets,
and ordering diligent enquiry to be made
in the neighbourhood for the diſcovery of
the wounded perſon, ſhe diſmiſſed him,
and herſelf remained in the ſame ſtate of
terrible ſuſpenſe. All the tenderneſs ſhe
had ever felt for Valancourt, was recalled
by the ſenſe of his danger; and the more
ſhe conſidered the ſubject, the more her
conviction ſtrengthened, that it was he,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0247300304:207"/>
who had viſited the gardens, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of ſoothing the miſery of diſappointed
affection, amidſt the ſcenes of his former
happineſs.</p>
            <p>"Dear madam," ſaid Annette, when
ſhe returned, "I never ſaw you ſo affected
before! I dare ſay the man is not killed."</p>
            <p>Emily ſhuddered, and lamented bitterly
the raſhneſs of the gardener in having
fired;</p>
            <p>"I knew you would be angry enough
about that, madam, or I ſhould have told
you before; and he knew ſo too; for, ſays
he, "Annette, ſay nothing about this to my
lady. She lies on the other ſide of the
houſe, ſo did not hear the gun, perhaps;
but ſhe would be angry with me, if ſhe
knew, ſeeing there is blood. But then,"
ſays he, "how is one to keep the garden
clear, if one is afraid to fire at a robber,
when one ſees him?"</p>
            <p>"No more of this," ſaid Emily, "pray
leave me."</p>
            <p>Annette obeyed, and Emily returned to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0247300304:208"/>
the agonizing conſiderations, that had aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her before, but which ſhe, at length, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ſooth by a new remark. If
the ſtranger was Valancourt, it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
he had come alone, and it appeared,
therefore, that he had been able to quit the
gardens, without aſſiſtance; a circumſtance
which did not ſeem probable, had his wound
been dangerous. With this conſideration,
ſhe endeavoured to ſupport herſelf, during
the enquiries, that were making by her
ſervants in the neighbourhood; but day
after day came, and ſtill cloſed in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
concerning this affair; and Emily,
ſuffering in ſilence, at length, drooped,
and ſunk under the preſſure of her anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety.
She was attacked by a ſlow fever,
and when ſhe yielded to the perſuation of
Annette to ſend for medical advice, the
physicians preſcribed little beſide air, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
exerciſe and amuſement: but how was
this laſt to be obtained? She, however,
endeavoured to abſtract her thoughts from
the ſubject of her anxiety, by employing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0247300304:209"/>
them in promoting that happineſs in others,
which ſhe had loft herſelf; and, when the
evening was fine, ſhe uſually took an air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
including in her ride the cottages of
ſome of her tenants, on whoſe condition
ſhe made ſuch obſervations, as often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
her, unaſked, to fulfil their wiſhes.</p>
            <p>Her indiſpoſition, and the buſineſs ſhe
engaged in, relative to this eſtate, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
protracted her ſlay at Tholouſe,
beyond the period ſhe had formerly fixed
for her departure to La Vallée; and now
ſhe was unwilling to leave the only place,
where it ſeemed poſſible, that certainty
could be obtained on the ſubject of her
diſtreſs. But the time was come, when her
preſence was neceſſary at La Vallée, a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the Lady Blanche now informing
her, that the Count and herſelf, being then
at the chateau of the Baron St. Foix, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to viſit her at La Vallée, on their
way home, as ſoon as they ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of her arrival there. Blanche add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they made this viſit, with the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0247300304:210"/>
hope of inducing her to return with them
to Chateau-le-Blanc.</p>
            <p>Emily, having replied to the letter of her
friend, and ſaid that ſhe ſhould be at La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lée
in a few days, made haſty preparations
for the journey; and, in thus leaving Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,
endeavoured to ſupport herſelf with
a belief, that, if any fatal accident had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to Valancourt, ſhe muſt in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
have heard of it.</p>
            <p>On the evening before her departure, ſhe
went to take leave of the terrace and the
pavilion. The day had been ſultry, but
a light ſhower, that fell juſt before ſun-ſet,
had cooled the air, and given that ſoft ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to the woods and paſtures, which is ſo
refreſhing to the eye; while the rain-drops,
ſtill trembling on the ſhrubs, glittered in
the laſt yellow gleam, that lighted up the
ſcene, and the air was filled with fragrance,
exhaled by the late ſhower, from herbs and
flowers and from the earth itſelf. But the
lovely proſpect, which Emily beheld from
the terrace, was no longer viewed by her
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0247300304:211"/>
with delight; ſhe ſighed deeply as her eye
wandered over it, and her ſpirits were in a
ſtate of ſuch dejection, that ſhe could not
think of her approaching return to La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lée,
without tears, and ſeemed to mourn
again the death of her father, as if it had
been an event of yeſterday. Having reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the pavilion, ſhe ſeated herſelf at the
open lattice, and, while her eyes ſettled on
the diſtant mountains, that overlooked Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony,
ſtill gleaming on the horizon, though
the ſun had now left the plains below,
"Alas!" ſaid ſhe, "I return to your long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſt
ſcenes, but ſhall meet no more the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
that were wont to render them delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!—no
more ſhall ſee the ſmile of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
or hear the well-known voice of
fondneſs:—all will now be cold and ſilent
in what was once my happy home."</p>
            <p>Tears ſtole down her cheek, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of what that home had been,
returned to her; but, after indulging her
ſorrow for ſome time, ſhe checked it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
herſelf of ingratitude in forgetting
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0247300304:212"/>
the friends, that ſhe poſſeſſed, while ſhe
lamented thoſe that were departed; and
ſhe, at length, left the pavilion and the
terrace, without having obſerved a ſhadow
of Valancourt or of any other perſon.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>ON the following morning, Emily left
Tholouſe at an early hour, and reached La
Vallée about ſun-ſet. With the melancholy
ſhe experienced on the review of a place
which had been the reſidence of her parents,
and the ſcene of her earlieſt delight, was
mingled, after the firſt ſhock had ſubſided,
a tender and undeſcribable pleaſure. For
time had ſo far blunted the acuteneſs of
her grief, that ſhe now courted every ſcene,
that awakened the memory of her friends;
in every room, where ſhe had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0247300304:214"/>
to ſee them, they almoſt ſeemed
to live again; and ſhe felt that La Vallée
was ſtill her happieſt home. One of the firſt
apartments ſhe viſited, was that, which had
been her father's library, and here ſhe ſeated
herſelf in his arm-chair, and, while ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated,
with tempered reſignation, the
picture of paſt times, which her memory
gave, the tears ſhe ſhed could ſcarcely be
called thoſe of grief.</p>
            <p>Soon after her arrival, ſhe was ſurpriſed
by a viſit from the venerable M. Barreaux,
who came impatiently to welcome the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his late reſpected neighbour, to her
long-deſerted home. Emily was comforted
by the preſence of an old friend, and they
paſſed an intereſting hour in converſing of
former times, and in relating ſome of the
circumſtances, that had occurred to each,
ſince they parted.</p>
            <p>The evening was ſo far advanced, when
M. Barreaux left Emily, that ſhe could not
viſit the garden that night; but, on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
morning, ſhe traced its long-regretted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0247300304:215"/>
ſcenes with fond impatience; and, as she
walked beneath the groves, which her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had planted, and where ſhe had ſo often
ſauntered in affectionate converſation with
him, his countenance, his ſmile, even the
accents of his voice, returned with exactneſs
to her fancy, and her heart melted to the
tender recollections.</p>
            <p>This, too, was his favourite ſeaſon of the
year, at which they had often together ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the rich and variegated tints of theſe
woods and the magical effect of autumnal
lights upon the mountains; and now, the
view of theſe circumſtances made memory
eloquent. As ſhe wandered penſively on,
ſhe fancied the following addreſs</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <head>TO AUTUMN.</head>
                  <l>Sweet Autumn! how thy melancholy grace</l>
                  <l>Steals on my heart, as through theſe ſhades I wind!</l>
                  <l>Sooth'd by thy breathing ſigh, I fondly trace</l>
                  <l>Each lonely image of the penſive mind!</l>
                  <l>Lov'd ſcenes, lov'd friends—long loſt! around me riſe,</l>
                  <l>And wake the melting thought, the tender tear!</l>
                  <l>That tear, that thought, which more than mirth I prize—</l>
                  <l>Sweet as the gradual tint, that paints thy year!</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0247300304:216"/>
Thy farewel ſmile, with fond regret, I view.</l>
                  <l>Thy beaming lights, ſoft gliding o'er the woods;</l>

            <p>One of Emily's earlieſt enquiries, after
her arrival at La Vallée, was concerning
Thereſa, her father's old ſervant, whom it
may be remembered that M. Queſnel had
turned from the houſe when it was let, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any proviſion. Underſtanding that ſhe
lived in a cottage at no great diſtance, Emily
walked thither, and, on approaching, was
pleaſed to ſee, that her habitation was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
ſituated on a green ſlope, ſheltered by
a tuft of oaks, and had an appearance of
comfort and extreme neatneſs. She found
the old woman within, picking vine-ſtalks,
who, on perceiving her young miſtreſs, was
nearly overcome with joy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0247300304:217"/>
"Ah! my dear young lady!" ſaid ſhe,
"I thought I ſhould never ſee you again in
this world, when I heard you was gone
to that outlandiſh country. I have been
hardly uſed, ſince you went; I little thought
they would have turned me out of my old
maſter's family in my old age!"</p>
            <p>Emily lamented the circumſtance, and then
aſſured her, that ſhe would make her latter
days comfortable, and expreſſed ſatisfaction,
on ſeeing her in ſo pleaſant an habitation.</p>
            <p>Thereſa thanked her with tears, adding,
"Yes, mademoiſelle, it is a very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
home, thanks to the kind friend, who
took me out of my diſtreſs, when you was
too far off to help me, and placed me here!
I little thought!—but no more of that—"</p>
            <p>"And who was this kind friend?" ſaid.
Emily: "whoever it was, I ſhall conſider
him as mine alſo."</p>
            <p>"Ah mademoiſelle! that friend forbad
me to blazon the good deed—I muſt not
ſay, who it was. But how you are altered
ſince I ſaw you laſt! You look ſo pale now,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0247300304:218"/>
and ſo thin, too; but then, there is my old
master's ſmile! Yes, that will never leave
you, any more than the goodneſs, that uſed
to make him ſmile. Alas-a-day! the poor
loſt a friend indeed, when he died!"</p>
            <p>Emily was affected by this mention of her
father, which Thereſa obſerving, changed
the ſubject. "I heard, mademoiſelle," ſaid
ſhe, "that Madame Cheron married a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
gentleman, after all, and took you
abroad; how does ſhe do?"</p>
            <p>Emily now mentioned her death. "Alas!"
ſaid Thereſa, "if ſhe had not been my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
ſiſter, I ſhould never have loved her;
ſhe was always ſo croſs. But how does that
dear young gentleman do, M. Valancourt?
he was an handſome youth, and a good one;
is he well, mademoiſelle?"</p>
            <p>Emily was much agitated.</p>
            <p>"A bleſſing on him!" continued The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa
"Ah, my dear young lady, you need
not look ſo ſhy; I know all about it. Do
you think I do not know, that he loves
you? Why, when you was away, mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0247300304:219"/>
he uſed to come to the chateau, and
walk about it, ſo diſconſolate! He would go
into every room in the lower part of the
houſe, and, ſometimes, he would ſit himſelf
down in a chair, with his arms acroſs, and
his eyes on the floor, and there he would
ſit, and think, and think, for the hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
He uſed to be very fond of the
ſouth parlour, becauſe I told him it uſed to
be yours; and there he would ſtay, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the pictures, which I ſaid you drew,
and playing upon your lute, that hung up
by the window, and reading in your books,
till ſun-ſet, and then he muſt go back to
his brother's chateau. And then—"</p>
            <p>"It is enough, Thereſa," ſaid Emily.—"How
long have you lived in this cottage—and
how can I ſerve you? will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
here, or return and live with me?"</p>
            <p>"Nay, mademoiſelle!" ſaid Thereſa,
"do not be ſo ſhy to your poor old ſervant.
I am ſure it is no diſgrace to like ſuch a
good young gentleman."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0247300304:220"/>
A deep ſigh eſcaped from Emily.</p>
            <p>"Ah! how he did love to talk of you!
I loved him for that. Nay, for that matter,
he liked to hear me talk, for he did not ſay
much himſelf. But I ſoon found out what
he came to the chateau about. Then, he
would go into the garden, and down to
the terrace, and fit under that great tree
there, for the day together, with one of
your books in his hand; but he did not
read much, I fancy; for one day I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to go that way, and I heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
talking. Who can be here? ſays I: I
am ſure I let nobody into the garden, but
the Chevalier! So I walked ſoftly, to ſee
who it could be; and behold! it was the
Chevalier himſelf, talking to himſelf about
you. And he repeated your name, and
ſighed ſo! and ſaid he had loſt you for
ever, for that you would never return for
him. I thought he was out in his reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, but I ſaid nothing, and ſtole
away."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0247300304:221"/>
"No more of this trifling," ſaid Emily,
awakening from her reverie: "it diſpleaſes
me;"</p>
            <p>"But, when M. Queſnel let the chateau,
I thought it would have broke the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's
heart."</p>
            <p>"Thereſa," ſaid Emily ſeriouſly, "you
muſt name the Chevalier no more!"</p>
            <p>"Not name him, mademoiſelle!" cried
Thereſa: "what times are come up now?
Why, I love the Chevalier next to my old
maſter and you, mademoiſelle."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps your love was not well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
then," replied Emily, trying to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
her tears; "but, however that might
be, we ſhall meet no more."</p>
            <p>"Meet no more!—not well beſtowed!"
exclaimed Thereſa. "What do I hear?
No, mademoiſelle, my love was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
for it was the Chevalier Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
who gave me this cottage, and has
ſupported me in my old age, ever ſince
M. Queſnel turned me from my master's
houſe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0247300304:222"/>
"The Chevalier Valancourt!" ſaid Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
trembling extremely.</p>
            <p>"Yes, mademoiſelle, he himſelf, though he
made me promiſe not to tell; but how could
one help, when one heard him ill ſpoken
of? Ah! dear young lady, you may well
weep, if you have behaved unkindly to
him, for a more tender heart than his never
young gentleman had. He found me out
in my diſtreſs, when you was too far off to
help me; and M. Queſnel refuſed to do ſo,
and bade me go to ſervice again—Alas! I was
too old for that I—The Chevalier found
me, and bought me this cottage, and gave
me money to furniſh it, and bade me ſeek
out another poor woman to live with me;
and he ordered his brother's ſteward to
pay me, every quarter, that which has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
me in comfort. Think then, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle,
whether I have not reaſon to
ſpeak well of the Chevalier. And there
are others, who could have afforded it better
than he: and I am afraid he has hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by his generoſity, for quarter day is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0247300304:223"/>
gone by long ſince, and no money for me!
But do not weep ſo, mademoiſelle: you are
not ſorry ſurely to hear of the poor Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's
goodneſs."</p>
            <p>"Sorry!" ſaid Emily, and wept the
more. "But how long is it ſince you have
ſeen him?"</p>
            <p>"Not this many a day, mademoiſelle."</p>
            <p>"When did you hear of him?" enquired
Emily, wish increaſed emotion.</p>
            <p>"Alas! never ſince he went away ſo
ſuddenly into Languedoc; and he was bur
juſt come from Paris then, or I ſhould
have ſeen him; I am ſure. Quarter day is
gone by long ſince, and, as I ſaid, no
money for me; and I begin, to fear ſome
harm has happened to him: and if I was
not ſo far from Eſtuviere, and ſo lame,
I ſhould have gone to enquire before this
time, and I have nobody to ſend ſo far."</p>
            <p>Emily's anxiety, as to the fate of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
was now ſcarcely endurable,
and, ſince propriety would not ſuffer her
to ſend to the chateau of his brother, ſhe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0247300304:224"/>
requeſted that Thereſa would immediately
hire ſome perſon to go to his ſteward from
herſelf, and, when he aſked for the quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
due to her, to make enquiries concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Valancourt. But ſhe firſt made The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa
promiſe never to mention her name in
this affair, or ever with that of the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
Valancourt; and her former faithfulneſs
to M. St. Aubert induced Emily to confide
in her aſſurances. Thereſa now joyfully
undertook to procure a perſon for this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
and then Emily, after giving her a
ſum of money to ſupply her with preſent
comforts, returned, with ſpirits heavily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
to her home, lamenting, more than
ever, that an heart, poſſeſſed of ſo much
benevolence as Valancourt's, should have
been contaminated by the vices of the
world, but affected by the delicate affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which his kindneſs to her old ſervant
expreſſed for herſelf.</p>

            <p>MEANWHILE Count De-Villefort and
Lady Blanche had paſſed a pleaſant fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
at the chateau de St. Foix, with the
Baron and Baroneſs, during which they
made frequent excurſions among the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and were delighted with the romantic
wildneſs of Pyrenéan ſcenery. It was with
regret, that the Count bade adieu to his
old friends, although with the hope of being
ſoon united with them in one family; for it
was ſettled, that M. St. Foix, who now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them into Gaſcony, ſhould receive
the hand of the Lady Blanche, upon their
arrival at Chateau-le-Blanc. As the road,
from the Baron's reſidence to La Vallée, was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0247300304:226"/>
over ſome of the wildeſt tract of the Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nées,
and where a carriage-wheel had never
paſſed, the Count hired mules for himſelf
and his family, as well as a couple of ſtout
guides, who were well armed, informed of all
the paſſes of the mountains, and who boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
too, that they were acquainted with every
brake and dingle in the way, could tell the
names of all the higheſt points of this chain
of Alps, knew every foreſt, that ſpread along
their narrow vallies, the ſhalloweſt part of
every torrent they muſt croſs, and the exaſt
diſtance of every goat-herd's and hunter's
cabin they ſhould have occaſion to paſs,—which
laſt article of learning required no
very capacious memory, for even ſuch ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
inhabitants were but thinly ſcattered
over theſe wilds.</p>
            <p>The Count left the chateau de St. Foix,
early in the morning, with an intention of
paſſing the night at a little inn upon the
mountains, about half way to La Vallée, of
which his guides had informed him; and,
though this was frequented chiefly by Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0247300304:227"/>
muleteers, on their route into France,
and, of courſe, would afford only ſorry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
the Count had no alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
for it was the only place like an inn,
on the road.</p>
            <p>After a day of admiration and fatigue,
the travellers found themſelves, about ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
in a woody valley, overlooked, on every
ſide, by abrupt heights. They had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
for many leagues, without ſeeing a
human habitation, and had only heard, now
and then, at a diſtance, the melancholy
tinkling of a ſheep-bell; but now they
caught the notes of merry muſic, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſaw, within a little green receſs among
the rocks, a group of mountaineers, tripping
through a dance. The Count, who could
not look upon the happineſs, any more than
on the miſery of others, with indifference,
halted to enjoy this ſcene of ſimple plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The group before him conſiſted of
French and Spaniſh peaſants, the inhabitants
of a neighbouring hamlet, ſome of whom
were performing a ſprightly dance, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0247300304:228"/>
with caſtanets in their hands, to the
ſounds of a lute and a tamborine, till, from
the briſk melody of France, the muſic
ſoftened into a ſlow movement, to which
two female peaſants danced a Spaniſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</p>
            <p>The Count, comparing this with the
ſcenes of ſuch gaiety as he had witneſſed at
Paris, where falſe taſte painted the features,
and, while it vainly tried to ſupply the glow
of nature, concealed the charms of anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—where
affectation ſo often diſtorted the
air, and vice perverted the manners—ſighed
to think, that natural graces and innocent
pleaſures flouriſhed in the wilds of ſolitude,
while they drooped amidſt the concourſe of
poliſhed ſociety. But the lengthening ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
reminded the travellers, that they had
no time to loſe; and, leaving this joyous
group, they purſued their way towards the
little inn, which was to ſhelter them from
the night.</p>
            <p>The rays of the ſetting ſun now threw a
yellow gleam upon the foreſts of pine and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0247300304:229"/>
cheſnut, that ſwept down the lower region
of the mountains, and gave reſplendent tints
to the ſnowy points above. But ſoon, even
this light faded faſt, and the ſcenery aſſumed
a more tremendous appearance, inveſted
with the obſcurity o twilight. Where the
torrent had been ſeen, it was now only
heard; where the wild cliffs had diſplayed
every variety of form and attitude, a dark
maſs of mountains now alone appeared;
and the vale, which far, far below had
opened its dreadful chaſm, the eye could
no longer fathom. A melancholy gleam
ſtill lingered on the ſummits of the higheſt
Alps, overlooking the deep repoſe of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſeeming to make the ſtillneſs of
the hour more awful.</p>
            <p>Blanche viewed the ſcene in ſilence, and
liſtened with enthuſiaſm to the murmur of
the pines, that extended in dark lines along
the mountains, and to the faint voice of the
izard, among the rocks, that came at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
on the air. But her enthuſiaſm ſunk
into apprehenſion, when, as the ſhadows
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0247300304:230"/>
deepened, ſhe looked upon the doubtful
precipice, that bordered the road, as well
as on the various fantaſtic forms of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that glimmered through the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
beyond it; and ſhe aſked her father, how
far they were from the inn, and whether he
did not conſider the road to be dangerous
at this late hour. The Count repeated the
firſt queſtion to the guides, who returned a
doubtful anſwer, adding, that, when it was
darker, it would be ſafeſt to reſt, till the
moon roſe. "It is ſcarcely ſafe to proceed
now," ſaid the Count; but the guides, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him that there was no danger, went on.
Blanche, revived by this aſſurance, again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
a penſive pleaſure, as ſhe watched the
progreſs of twilight gradually ſpreading its
tints over the woods and mountains, and
ſtealing from the eye every minuter feature
of the ſcene, till the grand outlines of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
alone remained. Then fell the ſilent
dews, and every wild flower, and aromatic
plant, that bloomed among the cliffs, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth its ſweetneſs; then, too, when the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0247300304:231"/>
mountain-bee had crept into its bloſſomed
bed, and the hum of every little infect, that
had floated gaily in the ſun-beam, was
huſhed, the found of many ſtreams, not
heard till now, murmured at a diſtance.—The
bats alone, of all the animals inhabiting
this region, ſeemed awake; and, while they
ſlitted acroſs the ſilent path, which Blanche
was purſuing, ſhe remembered the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lines, which Emily had given her:</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <head>TO THE BAT.</head>
                  <l>From haunt of man, from day's obtruſive glare;</l>
                  <l>Thou ſhroud'ſt thee in the ruin's ivy'd tow'r,</l>
                  <l>Or in ſome ſhadowy glen's romantic bow'r,</l>
                  <l>Where wizard forme their myſtic charms prepare,</l>
                  <l>Where Horror lurks, and ever-boding Care!</l>
                  <l>But, at the ſweet and ſilent ev'ning hour,</l>
                  <l>When clos'd in ſleep is ev'ry languid flow'r,</l>
                  <l>Thou lov'ſt to ſport upon the twilight air,</l>
                  <l>Mocking the eye, that would thy courſe purſue,</l>
                  <l>In many a wanton-round, elaſtic, gay,</l>
                  <l>Thou flit'ſt athwart the penſive wand'rer's way,</l>
                  <l>As his lone footſteps print the mountain-dew.</l>
                  <l>From Indian iſles thou com'ſt, with Summer's car,</l>
                  <l>Twilight thy love—thy guide her beaming ſtar!</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0247300304:232"/>
To a warm imagination, the dubious
forms, that float, half veiled in darkneſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a higher delight, than the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
ſcenery, that the ſun can ſhew. While
the fancy thus wanders over landſcapes
partly of its own creation, a ſweet compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
ſteals upon the mind, and</p>
            <q>
               <l>Refines it all to ſubtleſt feeling,</l>
               <l>Bids the tear of rapture roll.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The diſtant note of a torrent, the weak
trembling of the breeze among the woods,
or the far-off ſound of a human voice, now
loſt and heard again, are circumſtances
which wonderfully heighten the enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic
tone of the mind. The young St.
Foix, who ſaw the preſentations of a ſervid
fancy, and felt whatever enthuſiaſm could
ſuggeſt, ſometimes interrupted the ſilence,
which the reſt of the party ſeemed by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
conſent to preſerve, remarking and
pointing out to Blanche the moſt ſtriking
effect of the hour upon the ſcenery; while
Blanche, whoſe apprehenſions were, beguiled
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0247300304:233"/>
by the converſation of her lover, yielded
to the taſte ſo congenial to his, and they
converſed in a low reſtrained voice, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the penſive tranquillity, which twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and the ſcene inſpired, rather than of
any fear, that they ſhould be heard. Bur,
while the heart was thus ſoothed to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
St. Foix gradually mingled, with
his admiration of the country, a mention of
his affection; and he continued to ſpeak,
and Blanche to liſten till the mountains,
the woods, and the magical illuſions of twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
were remembered no more.</p>
            <p>The ſhadows of evening ſoon ſhifted to
the gloom of night, which was ſomewhat
anticipated by the vapours, that, gathering
faſt round the mountains, rolled in dark
wreaths along their ſides; and the guides
propoſed to reſt, till the moon ſhould riſe,
adding, that they thought a ſtorm was
coming on. As they looked round for a
ſpot, that might afford ſome kind of ſhelter,
an object was perceived obſcurely through
the duſk, on a point of rock, a little way
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0247300304:234"/>
down the mountain, which they imagined
to be a hunter's or a ſhepherd's cabin, and
the party, with cautious ſteps, proceeded
towards it. Their labour, however, was
not rewarded, or their apprehenſions
ſoothed; for, on reaching the object of their
ſearch, they diſcovered a monumental croſs,
which marked the ſpot to have been pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by murder.</p>
            <p>The darkneſs would not permit them to
read the inſcription; but the guides knew
this to be a croſs, raiſed to the memory of
a Count de Beliard, who had been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
here by a horde of banditti, that had
infeſted this part of the Pyrenées, a few
years before; and the uncommon ſize of
the monument ſeemed to juſtify the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
that it was erected for a perſon of
ſome diſtincion. Blanche ſhuddered, as
ſhe liſtened to ſome horrid particulars of
the Count's fate, which one of the guides
related in a low, reſtrained tone, as if the
ſound of his own voice frightened him;
but, while they lingered at the croſs, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0247300304:235"/>
to his narrative, a flaſh of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
glanced upon the rocks, thunder mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
at a diſtance, and the travellers, now
alarmed, quitted this ſcene of ſolitary hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
in ſearch of ſhelter.</p>
            <p>Having regained their former track, the
guides, as they paſſed on, endeavoured to
intereſt the Count by various ſtories of
robbery, and even of murder, which had
been perpetrated in the very places they
muſt unavoidably paſs, with accounts of
their own dauntleſs courage and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
eſcapes. The chief guide, or rather
he, who was the moſt completely armed,
drawing forth one of the four piſtols, that
were tucked into his belt, ſwore, that it
had ſhot three robbers within the year. He
then brandiſhed a claſp-knife of enormous
length, and was going to recount the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
execution it had done, when St,
Foix, perceiving, that Blanche was terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
interrupted him. The Count, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,
ſecretly laughing at the terrible hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
and extravagant boaſtings of the man,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0247300304:236"/>
reſolved to humour him, and, telling
Blanche in a whiſper, his deſign, began
to recount ſome exploits of his own, which
infinitely exceeded any related by the
guide.</p>
            <p>To theſe ſurpriſing circumſtances he ſo
artfully gave the colouring of truth, that
the courage of the guides was viſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, who continued ſilent, long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Count had ceaſed to ſpeak. The
loquacity of the chief hero thus laid aſleep,
the vigilance of his eyes and ears ſeemed
more thoroughly awakened, for he liſtened,
with much appearance of anxiety, to the
deep thunder, which murmured at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
and often pauſed, as the breeze, that
was now riſing, ruſhed among the pines.
But, when he made a ſudden halt before
a tuft of cork trees, that projected over
the road, and drew forth a piſtol, before
he would venture to brave the banditti
which might lurk behind it, the Count
could no longer refrain from laughter.</p>
            <p>Having now, however, arrived at a level
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0247300304:237"/>
ſpot, ſomewhat ſheltered from the air, by
overhanging cliffs and by a wood of larch,
that roſe over a precipice on the left, and
the guides being yet ignorant how far they
were from the inn, the travellers determined
to reſt, till the moon ſhould riſe, or the
ſtorm diſperſe. Blanche, recalled to a ſenſe
of the preſent moment, looked on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
gloom, with terror; but giving
her hand to St. Foix, ſhe alighted, and the
whole party entered a kind of cave, if ſuch
it could be called, which was only a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
cavity, formed by the curve of impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rocks. A light being ſtruck, a fire was
kindled, whoſe blaze afforded ſome degree
of cheerfulneſs and no ſmall comfort, for,
though the day had been hot, the night air
of this mountainous region was chilling;
a fire was partly neceſſary alſo to keep off
the wolves, with which thoſe wilds were
infeſted.</p>
            <p>Proviſions being ſpread upon a project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the rock, the Count and his family
partook of a ſupper, which, in a ſcene leſs
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0247300304:238"/>
rude, would, certainly have been thought
leſs excellent. When the repaſt was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
St. Foix, impatient for the moon,
ſauntered along the precipice, to a point,
that fronted the eaſt; but all was yet wrapt
in gloom, and the ſilence of night was
broken only by the murmuring of woods,
that waved far below, or by diſtant
thunder, and, now and then, by the faint
voices of the party he had quitted. He
viewed, with emotions of awful ſublimity,
the long volumes of ſulphureous clouds,
that floated along the upper and middle
regions of the air, and the lightnings that
flaſhed from them, ſometimes ſilently, and,
at others, followed by ſullen peals of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which the mountains feebly prolonged,
while the whole horizon, and the abyſs, on
which he ſtood, were diſcovered in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
light. Upon the ſucceeding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the fire, which had been kindled in
the cave, threw a partial gleam, illumining
ſome points of the oppoſite rocks, and the
ſummits of pine-woods, that hung beetling
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0247300304:239"/>
on the cliffs below, while their receſſes
ſeemed to frown in deeper ſhade.</p>
            <p>St. Foix ſtopped to obſerve the picture,
which the party in the cave preſented,
where the elegant form of Blanche was
finely contraſted by the majeſtic figure of
the Count, who was ſeated by her on a
rude ſtone, and each was rendered more
impreſſive by the groteſque habits and
ſtrong features of the guides and other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
who were in the back ground
of the piece. The effect of the light,
too, was intereſting; on the ſurrounding
figures it threw a ſtrong, though pale
gleam, and glittered on their bright arms;
while upon the foliage of a gigantic larch,
that impended its ſhade over the cliff above,
appeared a red, duſky tint, deepening almoſt
imperceptibly into the blackneſs of night.</p>
            <p>While St. Foix contemplated the ſcene,
the moon, broad and yellow, roſe over the
eaſtern ſummits, from among embattled
clouds, and ſhewed dimly the grandeur of
the heavens, the maſs of vapours, that roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0247300304:240"/>
half way down the precipice beneath,
and the doubtful mountains.</p>
            <q>
               <l>What dreadful pleaſure! there to ſtand ſublime,</l>
               <l>Like ſhipwreck'd mariner on deſert coaſt,</l>
               <l>And view th' enormous waſte of vapour, toſt</l>
               <l>In billows length'ning to th' horizon round<note n="*" place="bottom">The Minſtrel.</note>!</l>
            </q>
            <p>From this romantic reverie he was awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
by the voices of the guides, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his name, which was reverbed from
cliff to cliff, till an hundred tongues ſeemed
to call him; when he ſoon quieted the
fears of the Count and the Lady Blanche,
by returning to the cave. As the ſtorm,
however, ſeemed approaching, they did not
quit their place of ſhelter; and the Count,
ſeated between his daughter and St. Foix,
endeavoured to divert the fears of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and converſed on ſubjects, relating to
the natural hiſtory of the ſcene, among
which they wandered. He ſpoke of the
mineral and foſſile ſubſtances, found in the
depths of theſe mountains,—the veins of
marble and granite, with which they
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0247300304:241"/>
abounded, the ſtrata of ſhells, diſcovered
near their ſummits, many thouſand fathom
above the level of the ſea, and at a vaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from its preſent ſhore;—of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
chaſms and caverns of the rocks,
the groteſque form of the mountains, and
the various phaenomena, that ſeem to ſtamp
upon the world the hiſtory of the deluge.
From the natural hiſtory he deſcended to
the mention of events and circumſtances,
connected with the civil ſtory of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renées;
named ſome of the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fortreſſes, which France and Spain
had erected in the paſſes of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
and gave a brief account of ſome
celebrated ſieges and encounters in early
times, when Ambition firſt frightened So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
from theſe her deep receſſes, made
her mountains, which before had echoed
only to the torrent's roar, tremble with the
clang of arms, and, when man's firſt foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
in her ſacred haunts had left the
print of blood!</p>
            <p>As Blanche ſat, attentive to the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0247300304:242"/>
that rendered the ſcenes doubly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting,
and reſigned to ſolemn emotion,
while ſhe conſidered, that ſhe was on the
very ground, once polluted by theſe events,
her reverie was ſuddenly interrupted by a
ſound, that came in the wind.—It was the
diſtant bark of a watch-dog. The travellers
liſtened with eager hope, and, as the wind
blew ſtronger, fancied, that the ſound came
from no great diſtance; and, the guides hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little doubt, that it proceeded from the
inn they were in ſearch of, the Count deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to purſue his way. The moon now
afforded a ſtronger, though ſtill an uncertain
light, as ſhe moved among broken clouds;
and the travellers, led by the ſound, re-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
their journey along the brow of the
precipice, preceded by a ſingle torch, that
now contended with the moon-light; for
the guides, believing they ſhould reach
the inn ſoon after ſun-ſet, had neglected to
provide more. In ſilent caution they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the ſound, which was heard but
at intervals, and which, after ſome time
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0247300304:243"/>
entirely ceaſed. The guides endeavoured,
however, to point their courſe to the quarter,
whence it had iſſued, but the deep roaring of
a torrent ſoon ſeized their attention, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
they came to a tremendous chaſm of
the mountain, which ſeemed to forbid all
further progreſs. Blanche alighted from
her mule, as did the Count and St. Foix,
while the guides traverſed the edge in ſearch
of a bridge, which, however rude, might
convey them to the oppoſite ſide, and they,
at length, confeſſed, what the Count had
begun to ſuſpect, that they had been, for
ſome time, doubtful of their way, and were
now certain only, that they had loſt it.</p>
            <p>At a little diſtance, was diſcovered a
rude and dangerous paſſage, formed by an
enormous pine, which, thrown acroſs the
chaſm, united the oppoſite precipices, and
which had been felled probably by the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to facilitate his chace of the izard, or
the wolf. The whole party, the guides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
ſhuddered at the proſpect of croſſing
this alpine bridge, whoſe ſides afforded no
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0247300304:244"/>
kind of defence, and from which to fall was
to die. The guides, however, prepared to
lead over the mules, while Blanche ſtood
trembling on the brink, and liſtening to
the roar of the waters, which were ſeen
deſcending from rocks above, overhung
with lofty pines, and thence precipitating
themſelves into the deep abyſs, where their
white ſurges gleamed faintly in the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
The poor animals proceeded over
this perilous bridge with inſtinctive caution,
neither frightened by the noiſe of the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract,
or deceived by the gloom, which the
impending foliage threw athwart their way.
It was now, that the ſolitary torch, which
had been hitherto of little ſervice, was found
to be an ineſtimable treaſure; and Blanche,
terrified, ſhrinking, but endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
all her firmneſs and preſence of mind,
preceded by her lover and ſupported by
her father, followed the red gleam of the
torch, in ſafety, to the oppoſite cliff.</p>
            <p>As they went on, the heights contracted,
and formed a narrow paſs, at the bottom of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0247300304:245"/>
which, the torrent they had juſt croſſed, was
heard to thunder. But they were again
cheered by the bark of a dog, keeping
watch, perhaps, over the flocks of the
mountains, to protect them from the nightly
deſcent of the wolves. The ſound was
much nearer than before, and, while they
rejoiced in the hope of ſoon reaching a
place of repoſe, a light was ſeen to glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
at a diſtance. It appeared at a height
conſiderably above the level of their path,
and was loſt and ſeen again, as if the waving
branches of trees ſometimes excluded and
then admitted its rays. The guides hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looed
with all their ſtrength, but the ſound
of no human voice was heard in return,
and, at length, as a more effectual means
of making themſelves known, they fired a
piſtol. But, while they liſtened in anxious
expectation, the noiſe of the exploſion was
alone heard, echoing among the rocks, and
it gradually ſunk into a ſilence, which no
friendly hint of man diſturbed. The light,
however, that had been ſeen before, now
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0247300304:246"/>
became plainer, and, ſoon after, voices were
heard indiſtinctly on the wind; but, upon
the guides repeating the call, the voices
ſuddenly ceaſed, and the light diſappeared.</p>
            <p>The Lady Blanche was now almoſt ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beneath the preſſure of anxiety, fatigue
and apprehenſion, and the united efforts of
the Count and St. Foix could ſcarcely
ſupport her ſpirits. As they continued to
advance, an object was perceived on a point
of rock above, which, the ſtrong rays of the
moon then falling on it, appeared to be a
watch-tower. The Count, from its ſituation
and ſome other circumſtances, had little
doubt, that it was ſuch, and believing, that
the light had proceeded from thence, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to re-animate his daughter's ſpirits
by the near proſpect of ſhelter and repoſe,
which, however rude the accommodation,
a ruined watch-tower might afford.</p>
            <p>"Numerous watch-towers have been
erected among the Pyrenées," ſaid the
Count, anxious only to call Blanche's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the ſubject of her fears; "and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0247300304:247"/>
the method, by which they give intelligence
of the approach of the enemy, is, you know,
by fires, kindled on the ſummits of theſe
edifices. Signals have thus, ſometimes, been
communicated from poſt to poſt, along a
frontier line of ſeveral hundred miles in
length. Then, as occaſion may require,
the lurking armies emerge from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
and the foreſts, and march forth, to
defend, perhaps, the entrance of ſome
grand paſs, where, planting themſelves on
the heights, they aſſail their aſtoniſhed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who wind along the glen below, with
fragments of the ſhattered cliff, and pour
death and defeat upon them. The ancient
forts, and watch-towers, overlooking the
grand paſſes of the Pyrenées, are carefully
preſerved; but ſome of thoſe in inferior ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been ſuffered to fall into decay,
and are now frequently converted into the
more peaceful habitation of the hunter, or
the ſhepherd, who, after a day of toil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
hither, and, with his faithful dogs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
near a cheerful blaze, the labour of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0247300304:248"/>
chace, or the anxiety of collecting his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
flocks, while he is ſheltered from the
nightly ſtorm."</p>
            <p>"But are they always thus peacefully
inhabited?" ſaid the Lady Blanche.</p>
            <p>"No," replied the Count, "they are ſometimes the aſylum of French and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
ſmugglers, who croſs the mountains
with contraband goods from their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
countries, and the latter are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
numerous, againſt whom ſtrong
parties of the king's troops are ſometimes
ſent. But the deſperate reſolution of theſe
adventurers, who, knowing, that, if they
are taken, they muſt expiate the breach of
the law by the moſt cruel death, travel in
large parties, well armed, often daunts the
courage of the ſoldiers. The ſmugglers,
who ſeek only ſafety, never engage, when
they can poſſibly avoid it; the military,
alſo, who know, that in theſe encounters,
danger is certain, and glory almoſt unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
are equally reluctant to fight; an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
therefore, very ſeldom happens,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0247300304:249"/>
but, when it does, it never concludes till
after the moſt deſperate and bloody conflict.
You are inattentive, Blanche," added the
Count: "I have wearied you with a dull
ſubject; but ſee, yonder, in the moon-light,
is the edifice we have been in ſearch of,
and we are fortunate to be ſo near it, before
the ſtorm burſts."</p>
            <p>Blanche, looking up, perceived, that they
were at the foot of the cliff, on whoſe ſummit
the building ſtood, but no light now iſſued
from it; the barking of the dog too had,
for ſome time, ceaſed, and the guides began
to doubt, whether this was really the object
of their ſearch. From the diſtance, at which
they ſurveyed it, ſhewn imperfectly by a
cloudy moon, it appeared to be of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
than a ſingle watch-tower; but the
difficulty was how to aſcend the height,
whoſe abrupt declivities ſeemed to afford
no kind of path-way.</p>
            <p>While the guides carried forward the
torch to examine the cliff, the Count, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
with Blanche and St. Foix at its
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0247300304:250"/>
foot, under the ſhadow of the woods, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
again to beguile the time by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
but again anxiety abſtracted the
mind of Blanche; and he then conſulted,
apart with St. Foix, whether it would be
adviſable, ſhould a path be found, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to an edifice, which might poſſibly
harbour banditti. They conſidered, that
their own party was not ſmall, and that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them were well armed; and, after
enumerating the dangers, to be incurred by
paſſing the night in the open wild, expoſed,
perhaps, to the effect of a thunder-ſtorm,
there remained not a doubt, that they ought
to endeavour to obtain admittance to the
edifice above, at any hazard reſpecting the
inhabitants it might harbour; but the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the dead ſilence, that ſurrounded it,
appeared to contradict the probability of its
being inhabited at all.</p>
            <p>A ſhout from the guides arouſed their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
after which, in a few minutes, one
of the Count's ſervants returned with intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that a path was found, and they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0247300304:251"/>
haſtened to join the guides, when
they all aſcended a little winding way cut
in the rock among thickets of dwarf wood,
and, after much toil and ſome danger,
reached the ſummit, where ſeveral ruined
towers, ſurrounded by a maſſy wall, roſe
to their view, partially illumined by the
moon-light. The ſpace around the building
was ſilent, and apparently forſaken, but the
Count was cautious; "Step ſoftly," ſaid
he, in a low voice, "while we reconnoiter
the edifice."</p>
            <p>Having proceeded ſilently along for ſome
paces, they ſtopped at a gate, whoſe portals
were terrible even in ruins, and, after a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
heſitation, paſled on to the court of
entrance, but pauſed again at the head of a
terrace, which, branching from it, ran along
the brow of a precipice. Over this, roſe the
main body of the edifice, which was now
ſeen to be, not a watch-tower, but one or
thoſe ancient fortreſſes, that, from age and
neglect, had fallen to decay. Many parts
of it, however, appeared to be ſtill entire;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0247300304:252"/>
it was built of grey ſtone, in the heavy
Saxon-gothic ſtyle, with enormous round
towers, buttreſſes of proportionable ſtrength,
and the arch of the large gate, which ſeemed
to open into the hall of the fabric, was
round, as was that of a window above. The
air of ſolemnity, which muſt ſo ſtrongly
have characterized the pile even in the days
of its early ſtrength, was now conſiderably
heightened by its ſhattered battlements and
half-demoliſhed walls, and by the huge
maſſes of ruin, ſcattered in its wide area,
now ſilent and graſs grown. In this court
of entrance ſtood the gigantic remains of an
oak, that ſeemed to have flouriſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
with the building, which it ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
frowningly to protect by the few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
branches, leafleſs and moſs-grown,
that crowned its trunk, and whoſe wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
told how enormous the tree had been in
a former age. This fortreſs was evidently
once of great ſtrength, and, from its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on a point of rock, impending over a
deep glen, had been of great power to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0247300304:253"/>
as well as to reſiſt; the Count, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as he ſtood ſurveying it, was ſomewhat
ſurpriſed, that it had been ſuffered, ancient
as it was, to ſink into ruins, and its preſent
lonely and deſerted air excited in his breaſt
emotions of melancholy awe. While he
indulged, for a moment, theſe emotions, he
thought he heard a ſound of remote voices
ſteal upon the ſtillneſs, from within the
building, the front of which he again ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
with ſcrutinizing eyes, but yet no light
was viſible. He now determined to walk
round the fort, to that remote part of it,
whence he thought the voices had ariſen,
that he might examine whether any light
could be diſcerned there, before he ventured
to knock at the gate; for this purpoſe,
he entered upon the terrace, where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of cannon were yet apparent in the
thick walls, but he had not proceeded
many paces, when his ſteps were ſuddenly
arreſted by the loud barking of a dog
within, and which he fancied to be the ſame,
whoſe voice had been the means of bringing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0247300304:254"/>
the travellers thither. It now appeared cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the place was inhabited, and the
Count returned to conſult again with St.
Foix, whether he ſhould try to obtain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
for its wild aſpect had ſomewhat
ſhaken his former reſolution; but, after a
ſecond conſultation, he ſubmitted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
which before determined him,
and which were ſtrengthened by the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the dog, that guarded the fort,
as well as by the ſtillneſs that pervaded
it. He, therefore, ordered one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to knock at the gate, who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
to obey him, when a light appeared
through the loop-hole of one of the towers,
and the Count called loudly, but, receiving
no anſwer, he went up to the gate himſelf,
and ſtruck upon it with an iron-pointed pole,
which had aſſiſted him to climb the ſteep.
When the echoes had ceaſed, that this blow
had awakened, the renewed barking,—and
there were now more than one dog,—was
the only ſound, that was heard. The Count
ſtepped back, a few paces, to obſerve
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0247300304:255"/>
whether the light was in the tower, and,
perceiving, that it was gone, he returned to
the portal, and had lifted the pole to
ſtrike again, when again he fancied he heard
the murmur of voices within, and pauſed
to liſten. He was confirmed in the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they were too remote, to be heard
otherwiſe than in a murmur, and the Count
now let the pole fall heavily upon the gate;
when almoſt immediately a profound ſilence
followed. It was apparent, that the people
within had heard the ſound, and their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in admitting ſtrangers gave him a
favourable opinion of them. "They are
either hunters or ſhepherds," ſaid he,
"who, like ourſelves, have probably ſought
ſhelter from the night within theſe walls,
and are fearful of admitting ſtrangers, leſt
they ſhould prove robbers. I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to remove their fears." So ſaying, he
called aloud, "We are friends, who aſk
ſhelter from the night." In a few moments,
ſteps were heard within, which approached,
and a voice then enquired—"Who calls?"
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0247300304:256"/>
"Friends," repeated the Count; "open
the gates, and you ſhall know more."—Strong
bolts were now heard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
and a man, armed with a hunting
ſpear, appeared. "What is it you want
at this hour?" ſaid he. The Count beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
his attendants, and then, anſwered,
that he wiſhed to enquire the way to the
neareſt cabin. "Are you ſo little acquainted
with theſe mountains," ſaid the man, "as
not to know, that there is none, within ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
leagues? I cannot ſhew you the way;
you muſt ſeek it—there's a moon." Saying
this, he was cloſing the gate, and the Count
was turning away, half diſappointed and
half afraid, when another voice was heard
from above, and, on looking up, he ſaw a
light, and a man's face, at the grate of the
portal. "Stay, friend, you have loſt your
way?" ſaid the voice. "You are hunters,
I ſuppoſe, like ourſelves: I will be with
you preſently." The voice ceaſed, and the
light diſappeared. Blanche had been alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the appearance of the man, who had
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0247300304:257"/>
opened the gate, and ſhe now entreated her
father to quit the place; but the Count
had obſerved the hunter's ſpear, which he
carried; and the words from the tower en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him to await the event. The gate
was ſoon opened, and ſeveral men in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters'
habits, who had heard above what had
paſſed below, appeared, and, having liſtened
ſome time to the Count, told him he was
welcome to reſt there for the night. They
then preſſed him, with much courteſy, to
enter, and to partake of ſuch fare as they
were about to ſit down to. The Count,
who had obſerved them attentively while
they ſpoke, was cautious, and ſomewhat ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious;
but he was alſo weary, fearful of
the approaching ſtorm, and of encountering
alpine heights in the obſcurity of night;
being likewiſe ſomewhat confident in the
ſtrength and number of his attendants, he,
after ſome further conſideration, determined
to accept the invitation. With this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
he called his ſervants, who, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
round the tower, behind which ſome of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0247300304:258"/>
them had ſilently liſtened to this conference,
followed their Lord, the Lady Blanche, and
St. Foix into the fortreſs. The ſtrangers
led them on to a large and rude hall, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
ſeen by a fire, that blazed at its extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
round which four men, in the hunter's
dreſs, were ſeated, and on the hearth were
ſeveral dogs ſtretched in ſleep. In the
middle of the hall ſtood a large table, and
over the fire ſome part of an animal was
boiling. As the Count approached, the men
aroſe, and the dogs, half raiſing themſelves,
looked fiercely at the ſtrangers, but, on
hearing their maſters' voices, kept their
poſtures on the hearth.</p>
            <p>Blanche looked round this gloomy and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
hall; then at the men, and to her father,
who, ſmiling cheerfully at her, addreſſed
himſelf to the hunters. "This is an hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
hearth," ſaid he, "the blaze of a fire is
reviving after having wandered ſo long in
theſe dreary wilds. Your dogs are tired;
what ſucceſs have you had?" "Such as we
uſually have," replied one of the men, who
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0247300304:259"/>
had been ſeated in the hall, "we kill our
game with tolerable certainty." "Theſe
are fellow hunters," ſaid one of the men who
had brought the Count hither, "that have
loſt their way, and I have told them there is
room enough in the fort for us all." "Very
true, very true," replied his companion,
"What luck have you had in the chace,
brothers? We have killed two izards, and
that, you will ſay, is pretty well." "You
miſtake, friend," ſaid the Count, "we are
not hunters, but travellers; but, if you will
admit us to hunters' fare, we ſhall be well
contented, and will repay your kindneſs."
"Sit down then, brother," ſaid one of the
men: "Jacques, lay more fuel on the fire,
the kid will ſoon be ready; bring a ſeat for
the lady too. Ma'amſelle, will you taſte
our brandy? it is true Barcelona, and as
bright as ever flowed from a keg." Blanche
timidly ſmiled, and was going to refuſe,
when her father prevented her, by taking,
with a good humoured air, the glaſs offered
to his daughter; and Monſ. St. Foix, who
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0247300304:260"/>
was ſeated next her, preſſed her hand, and
gave her an encouraging look, but her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was engaged by a man, who ſat
ſilently by the fire, obſerving St. Foix, with
a ſteady and earneſt eye.</p>
            <p>"You lead a jolly life here," ſaid the
Count. "The life of a hunter is a pleaſant
and a healthy one; and the repoſe is ſweet,
which ſucceeds to your labour."</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied one of his hoſts, "our
life is pleaſant enough. We live here only
during the ſummer, and autumnal months;
in winter, the place is dreary, and the
ſwoln torrents, that deſcend from the
heights, put a ſtop to the chace."</p>
            <p>"'Tis a life of liberty and enjoyment,"
ſaid the Count: "I ſhould like to paſs a
month in your way very well."</p>
            <p>"We find employment for our guns
too," ſaid a man who ſtood behind the
Count:" here are plenty of birds, of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
flavour, that feed upon the wild thyme
and herbs, that grow in the vallies. Now
I think of it, there is a brace of bird's hung
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0247300304:261"/>
up in the ſtone gallery; go fetch them,
Jacques, we will have them dreſſed."</p>
            <p>The Count now made enquiry, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the method of purſuing the chace among
the rocks and precipices of theſe romantic
regions, and was liſtening to a curious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
when a horn was ſounded at the gate.
Blanche looked timidly at her father, who
continued to converſe on the ſubjeſt of the
chace, but whoſe countenance was ſomewhat
expreſſive of anxiety, and who often turned
his eyes towards that part of the hall neareſt
the gate. The horn founded again, and a
loud halloo ſucceeded. "Theſe are ſome
of our companions, returned from their
day's labour," ſaid a man, going lazily from
his ſeat towards the gate; and in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
two men appeared, each with a gun
over his ſhoulder, and piſtols in his belt.
"What cheer, my lads? what cheer?" ſaid
they, as they approached. "What luck?"
returned their companions: "have you
brought home your ſupper? You ſhall have
none elſe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0247300304:262"/>
"Hah! who the devil have you brought
home?" ſaid they in bad Spaniſh, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Count's party, "are they from
France, or Spain?—where did you meet
with them?"</p>
            <p>"They met with us, and a merry meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too," replied his companion aloud in
good French. "This chevalier, and his
party, had loſt their way, and aſked a night's
lodging in the fort." The others made no
reply, but threw down a kind of knapſack,
and drew forth ſeveral brace of birds. The
bag ſounded heavily as it fell to the ground,
and the glitter of ſome bright metal within
glanced on the eye of the Count, who now
ſurveyed, with a more enquiring look, the
man, that held the knapſack. He was a tall
robuſt figure, of a hard countenance, and
had ſhort black hair, curling in his neck.
Inſtead of the hunter's dreſs, he wore a faded
military uniform; ſandals were laced on
his broad legs, and a kind of ſhort trowſers
hung from his waiſt. On his head he wore
a leathern cap, ſomewhat reſembling in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0247300304:263"/>
ſhape an ancient Roman helmet; but the
brows that ſcowled beneath it, would have
characterized thoſe of the barbarians, who
conquered Rome, rather than thoſe of a
Roman ſoldier. The Count, at length,
turned away his eyes, and remained ſilent
and thoughtful, till, again raiſing them, he
perceived a figure ſtanding in an obſcure
part of the hall, fixed in attentive gaze on
St. Foix, who was converſing with Blanche,
and did not obſerve this; but the Count,
ſoon after, ſaw the ſame man looking over
the ſhoulder of the ſoldier as attentively at
himſelf. He withdrew his eye, when that
of the Count met it, who felt miſtruſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
faſt upon his mind, but feared to
betray it in his countenance, and, forcing
his features to aſſume a ſmile, addreſſed
Blanche on ſome indifferent ſubject. When
he again looked round, he perceived, that
the ſoldier and his companion were gone.</p>
            <p>The man, who was called Jacques, now
returned from the ſtone gallery. "A fire is
lighted there," ſaid he, "and the birds are
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0247300304:264"/>
dreſſing; the table too is ſpread there, for
that place is warmer than this."</p>
            <p>His companions approved of the removal,
and invited their gueſts to follow to the
gallery, of whom Blanche appeared diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed,
and remained ſeated, and St. Foix
looked at the Count, who ſaid, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the comfortable blaze of the fire he
was then near. The hunters, however,
commended the warmth of the other apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and preſſed his removal with ſuch
ſeeming courteſy, that the Count, half
doubting, and half fearful of betraying his
doubts, conſented to go. The long and
ruinous paſſages, through which they went,
ſomewhat daunted him, but the thunder,
which now burſt in loud peals above, made
it dangerous to quit this place of ſhelter,
and he forbore to provoke his conductors
by ſhewing that he diſtruſted them. The
hunters led the way, with a lamp; the
Count and St. Foix, who wiſhed to pleaſe
their hoſts by ſome inſtances of familiarity,
carried each a ſeat, and Blanche followed,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0247300304:265"/>
with faltering ſteps. As ſhe paſſed on,
part of her dreſs caught on a nail in the
wall, and, while ſhe ſtopped, ſomewhat
too ſcrupulouſly, to diſengage it, the Count,
who was talking to St. Foix, and neither of
whom obſerved the circumſtance, followed
their conductor round an abrupt angle of
the paſſage, and Blanche was left behind in
darkneſs. The thunder prevented them
from hearing her call, but, having diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
her dreſs, ſhe quickly followed, as ſhe
thought, the way they had taken. A light,
that glimmered at a diſtance, confirmed
this belief, and ſhe proceeded towards an
open door, whence it iſſued, conjecturing
the room beyond to be the ſtone gallery the
men had ſpoken of. Hearing voices as ſhe
advanced, ſhe pauſed within a few paces of
the chamber, that ſhe might be certain
whether ſhe was right, and from thence, by
the light of a lamp, that hung from the
ceiling, obſerved four men, ſeated round a
table, over which they leaned in apparent
conſultation. In one of them ſhe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0247300304:266"/>
the features of him, whom ſhe had
obſerved, gazing at St. Foix, with ſuch deep
attention; and who was now ſpeaking in
an earneſt, though reſtrained voice, till, one
of his companions ſeeming to oppoſe him,
they ſpoke together in a loud and harſher
tone. Blanche, alarmed by perceiving,
that neither her father, or St. Foix were
there, and terrified at the fierce countenances
and manners of theſe men, was turning haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
from the chamber, to purſue her ſearch
of the gallery, when ſhe heard one of the
men ſay:</p>
            <p>"Let all diſpute end here. Who talks
of danger? Follow my advice, and there
will be none—ſecure <hi>them,</hi> and the reſt are
an eaſy prey." Blanche, ſtruck with theſe
words, pauſed a moment, to hear more.
"There is nothing to be got by the reſt,"
ſaid one of his companions, "I am never
for blood when I can help it—diſpatch the
two others and our buſineſs is done; the
reſt may go."</p>
            <p>"May they ſo?" exclaimed the firſt ruffian,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0247300304:267"/>
with a tremendous oath—"What! To
tell how we have diſpoſed of their maſters,
and to ſend the king's troops to drag us to
the wheel! You was always a choice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer—I
warrant we have not yet forgot
St. Thomas's eve laſt year."</p>
            <p>Blanche's heart now ſunk with horror.
Her firſt impulſe was to retreat from the
door, but, when ſhe would have gone, her
trembling frame refuſed to ſupport her, and,
having tottered a few paces, to a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
part of the paſſage, ſhe was compelled
to liſten to the dreadful councils of thoſe,
who, ſhe was no longer ſuffered to doubt,
were banditti. In the next moment, ſhe
heard the following words, "Why you
would not murder the whole <hi>gang?</hi>"</p>
            <p>"I warrant our lives are as good as theirs,"
replied his comrade. "If we don't kill them,
they will hang us: better they ſhould die
than we be hanged."</p>
            <p>"Better, better," cried his comrades.</p>
            <p>"To commit murder, is a hopeful way of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0247300304:268"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

of eſcaping the gallows!" ſaid the firſt ruffian—"
many an honeſt fellow has run
his head into the nooſe that way, though."
There was a pauſe of ſome moments, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which they appeared to be conſidering.</p>
            <p>"Confound thoſe fellows," exclaimed
one of the robbers impatiently, "they
ought to have been here by this time; they
will come back preſently with the old ſtory,
and no booty: if they were here, our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would be plain and eaſy. I ſee we
ſhall not be able to do the buſineſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
for our numbers are not equal to the
enemy, and in the morning they will be for
marching off, and how can we detain them
without force?"</p>
            <p>"I have been thinking of a ſcheme, that
will do," ſaid one of his comrades: "if we
can diſpatch the two chevaliers ſilently, it
will be eaſy to maſter the reſt."</p>
            <p>"That's a plauſible ſcheme, in good
faith," ſaid another with a ſmile of ſcorn—"If
I can eat my way through the priſon
wall, I ſhall be at liberty!—How can we
diſpatch them <hi>ſilently?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0247300304:271"/>
"By poiſon," replied his companions.</p>
            <p>"Well ſaid! that will do," ſaid the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ruffian, "that will give a lingering
death too, and ſatisfy my revenge. Theſe
barons ſhall take care how they again tempt
our vengeance."</p>
            <p>"I knew the ſon, the moment I ſaw
him," ſaid the man, whom Blanche had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
gazing on St. Foix, "though he
does not know me; the father I had almoſt
forgotten."</p>
            <p>"Well, you may ſay what you will,"
ſaid the third ruffian, "but I don't believe
he is the Baron, and I am as likely to know
as any of you, for I was one of them, that
attacked him, with our brave lads, that ſuffered."</p>
            <p>"And was not I another?" ſaid the firſt
ruffian, "I tell you he is the Baron; but
what does it ſignify whether he is or not?—ſhall
we let all this booty go out of our
hands? It is not often we have ſuch luck as
this. While we run the chance of the
wheel for ſmuggling a few pounds of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0247300304:272"/>
to cheat the king's manufactory, and
of breaking our necks down the precipices
in the chace of our food; and, now and
then, rob a brother ſmuggler, or a ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
pilgrim, of what ſcarcely repays us
the powder we fire at them, ſhall we let ſuch
a prize as this go? Why they have enough
about them to keep us for—"</p>
            <p>"I am not for that, I am not for that,"
replied the third robber, "let us make the
moſt of them: only, if this is the Baron, I
ſhould like to have a flaſh the more at him,
for the ſake of our brave comrades, that he
brought to the gallows."</p>
            <p>"Aye, aye, ſlaſh as much as you will,"
rejoined the firſt man, "but I tell you the
Baron is a taller man."</p>
            <p>"Confound your quibbling," ſaid the
ſecond ruffian, "ſhall we let them go or
not? If we ſtay here much longer, they
will take the hint, and march off without
our leave. Let them be who they will,
they are rich, or why all thoſe ſervants?
Did you ſee the ring, he, you call the Baron,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0247300304:273"/>
had on his finger?—it was diamond; but
he has not got it on now: he ſaw me look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at it, I warrant, and took it off."</p>
            <p>"Aye, and then there is the picture; did
you ſee that? She has not taken that off,"
obſerved the firſt ruffian, "it hangs at her
neck; if it had not ſparkled ſo, I ſhould not
have found it out, for it was almoſt hid by
her dreſs; thoſe are diamonds too, and a
rare many of them there muſt be, to go
round ſuch a large picture."</p>
            <p>"But how are we to manage this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?"
ſaid the ſecond ruffian: "let us talk
of that, there is no fear of there being
booty enough, but how are we to ſecure
it?"</p>
            <p>"Aye, aye," ſaid his comrades, "let us
talk of that, and remember no time is to be
loſt."</p>
            <p>"I am ſtill for poiſon," obſerved the
third, "but conſider their number; why
there are nine or ten of them, and armed too;
when I ſaw ſo many at the gate, I was not
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0247300304:274"/>
for letting them in, you know, nor you
either."</p>
            <p>"I thought they might be ſome of our
enemies," replied the ſecond, "I did not ſo
much mind numbers."</p>
            <p>"But you muſt mind them now," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
his comrade, "or it will be worſe
for you. We are not more than ſix, and
how can we maſter ten by open force? I
tell you we muſt give ſome of them a doſe,
and the reſt may then be managed."</p>
            <p>"I'll tell you a better way," rejoined the
other impatiently, "draw cloſer."</p>
            <p>Blanche, who had liſtened to this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
in an agony, which it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to deſcribe, could no longer diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
what was ſaid, for the ruffians now
ſpoke in lowered voices; but the hope, that
ſhe might ſave her friends from the plot, if
ſhe could find her way quickly to them,
ſuddenly re-animated her ſpirits, and lent
her ſtrength enough to turn her ſteps in
ſearch of the gallery. Terror, however,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0247300304:275"/>
and darkneſs conſpired againſt her, and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moved a few yards, the feeble light, that
iſſued from the chamber, no longer even
contended with the gloom, and, her foot
ſtumbling over a ſtep that croſſed the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
ſhe fell to the ground.</p>
            <p>The noiſe ſtartled the banditti, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſuddenly ſilent, and then all ruſhed to
the paſſage, to examine whether any perſon
was there, who might have overheard their
councils, Blanche ſaw them approaching,
and perceived their fierce and eager looks:
but, before ſhe could raiſe herſelf, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
and ſeized her, and, as they dragged
her towards the chamber they had quitted,
her ſcreams drew from them horrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings.</p>
            <p>Having reached the room, they began to
conſult what they ſhould do with her. "Let
us firſt know what ſhe has heard," ſaid the
chief robber. "How long have you been in
the paſſage, lady, and what brought you
there?"</p>
            <p>"Let us firſt ſecure that picture," ſaid
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0247300304:276"/>
one of his comrades, approaching the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Blanche. "Fair lady, by your leave
that picture is mine; come, ſurrender it, or
I ſhall ſeize it."</p>
            <p>Blanche, entreating their mercy, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
gave up the miniature, while another
of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her,
concerning what ſhe had overheard of their
converſation, when, her confuſion and terror
too plainly telling what her tongue feared
to confeſs, the ruffians looked expreſſively
upon one another, and two of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to a remote part of the room, as if
to conſult further.</p>
            <p>"Theſe are diamonds, by St. Peter!"
exclaimed the fellow, who had been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the miniature, "and here is a very
pretty picture too, faith; as handſome a
young chevalier, as you would wiſh to ſee
by a ſummer's ſun. Lady, this is your
ſpouſe, I warrant, for it is the ſpark, that
was in your company juſt now."</p>
            <p>Blanche, ſinking with terror, conjured
him to have pity on her, and, delivering
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0247300304:277"/>
him her purſe, promiſed to ſay nothing of
what had paſſed, if he would ſuffer her to
return to her friends.</p>
            <p>He ſmiled ironically, and was going to
reply, when his attention was called off by
a diſtant noiſe; and, while he liſtened, he
graſped the arm of Blanche more firmly, as
if he feared ſhe would eſcape from him, and
ſhe again ſhrieked for help.</p>
            <p>The approaching ſounds called the ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians
from the other part of the chamber.
"We are betrayed," ſaid they; "but let
us liſten a moment, perhaps it is only our
comrades come in from the mountains, and
if ſo, our work is ſure; liſten!"</p>
            <p>A diſtant diſcharge of ſhot confirmed this
ſuppoſition for a moment, but, in the next,
the former ſounds drawing nearer, the claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſwords, mingled with the voices of
loud contention and with heavy groans,
were diſtinguiſhed in the avenue leading to
the chamber. While the ruffians prepared
their arms, they heard themſelves called by
ſome of their comrades afar off, and then a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0247300304:278"/>
ſhrill horn was ſounded without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
a ſignal, it appeared, they too well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
for three of them, leaving the
Lady Blanche to the care of the fourth,
inſtantly ruſhed from the chamber.</p>
            <p>While Blanche, trembling, and nearly
fainting, was ſupplicating for releaſe, ſhe
heard amid the tumult, that approached, the
voice of St. Foix, and ſhe had ſcarcely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
her ſhriek, when the door of the room
was thrown open, and he appeared, much
disfigured with blood, and purſued by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ruffians. Blanche neither ſaw, or heard
any more; her head ſwam, her ſight failed,
and ſhe became ſenſeleſs in the arms of the
robber, who had detained her.</p>
            <p>When ſhe recovered, ſhe perceived, by
the gloomy light, that trembled round
her, that ſhe was in the ſame chamber,
but neither the Count, St. Foix, or any
other perſon appeared, and ſhe continued,
for ſome time, entirely ſtill, and nearly in
a ſtate of ſtupefaction. But, the dreadful
images of the paſt returning, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0247300304:279"/>
to raiſe herſelf, that ſhe might ſeek
her friends, when a ſullen groan, at a little
diſtance, reminded her of St. Foix, and of
the condition, in which ſhe had ſeen him
enter this room; then, ſtarting from the
floor, by a ſudden effort of horror, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the place whence the ſound had
proceeded, where a body was lying ſtretched
upon the pavement, and where, by the glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
light of a lamp, ſhe diſcovered the
pale and disfigured countenance of St. Foix.
Her horrors at that moment, may be eaſily
imagined. He was ſpeechleſs; his eyes
were half cloſed, and, on the hand, which
ſhe graſped in the agony of deſpair, cold
damps had ſettled. While ſhe vainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
his name, and called for aſſiſtance,
ſteps approached, and a perſon entered the
chamber, who, ſhe ſoon perceived, was
not the Count, her father; but, what was
her aſtoniſhment, when, ſupplicating him
to give his aſſiſtance to St. Foix, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
Ludovico! He ſcarcely pauſed to
recogniſe her, but immediately bound up
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0247300304:280"/>
the wounds of the Chevalier, and, perceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he had fainted probably from loſs
of blood, ran for water; but he had been
abſent only a few moments, when Blanche
heard other ſteps approaching, and, while
ſhe was almoſt frantic with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the ruffians, the light of a torch
flaſhed upon the walls, and then Count De
Villefort appeared, with an affrighted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and breathleſs with impatience,
calling upon his daughter. At the ſound of
his voice, ſhe roſe, and ran to his arms,
while he letting fall the bloody ſword he
held, preſſed her to his boſom in a tranſport
of gratitude and joy, and then haſtily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for St. Foix, who now gave ſome
ſigns of life. Ludovico ſoon after returning
with water and brandy, the former was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to his lips, and the latter to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and hands, and Blanche, at length, ſaw
him uncloſe his eyes, and then heard him
enquire for her; but the joy ſhe felt, on
this occaſion, was interrupted by new
alarms, when Ludovico ſaid it would be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0247300304:281"/>
neceſſary to remove Monſ. St. Foix imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and added, "The banditti, that
are out, my Lord, were expected home, an
hour ago, and they will certainly find us, if
we delay. That ſhrill horn, they know,
is never ſounded by their comrades but on
moſt deſperate occaſions, and it echoes
among the mountains for many leagues
round. I have known them brought home
by its ſound even from the Pied de Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.
Is any body ſtanding watch at the
great gate, my Lord?"</p>
            <p>"Nobody," replied the Count; "the
reſt of my people are now ſcattered
about, I ſcarcely know where. Go, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,
collect them together, and look
out yourſelf, and liſten if you hear the feet
of mules."</p>
            <p>Ludovico then hurried away, and the
Count conſulted as to the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
St. Foix, who could not have
borne the motion of a mule, even if his
ſtrength would have ſupported him in the
ſaddle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0247300304:282"/>
While the Count was telling, that the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti,
whom they had found in the fort, were
ſecured in the dungeon, Blanche obſerved
that he was himſelf wounded, and that his
left arm was entirely uſeleſs; but he ſmiled
at her anxiety, aſſuring her the wound was
trifling.</p>
            <p>The Count's ſervants, except two who
kept watch at the gate, now appeared, and,
ſoon after, Ludovico. "I think I hear
mules coming along the glen, my Lord,"
ſaid he, "but the roaring of the torrent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
will not let me be certain; however, I
have brought what will ſerve the Chevalier,"
he added, ſhewing a bear's ſkin, faſtened to
a couple of long poles, which had been
adapted for the purpoſe of bringing home ſuch
of the banditti as happened to be wounded
in their encounters. Ludovico ſpread it
on the ground, and, placing the ſkins of
ſeveral goats upon it, made a kind of bed,
into which the Chevalier, who was however
now much revived, was gently lifted; and,
the poles being raiſed upon the ſhoulders of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0247300304:283"/>
the guides, whoſe footing among theſe ſteeps
could beſt be depended upon, he was borne
along with an eaſy motion. Some of the
Count's ſervants were alſo wounded—but
not materially, and, their wounds being
bound up, they now followed to the great
gate. As they paſſed along the hall, a loud
tumult was heard at ſome diſtance, and
Blanche was terrified. "It is only thoſe
villains in the dungeon, my Lady," ſaid
Ludovico. "They ſeem to be burſting it
open," ſaid the Count. "No, my Lord,"
replied Ludovico, "it has an iron door;
we have nothing to fear from them; but
let me go firſt, and look out
from the rampart."</p>
            <p>They quickly followed him, and found
their mules browſing before the gates, where
the party liſtened anxiously, but heard no
ſound, except that of the torrent below and
of the early breeze, ſighing among the
branches of the old oak, that grew in the
court; and they were now glad to perceive
the firſt tints of dawn over the mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0247300304:284"/>
When they had mounted their mules,
Ludovico, undertaking to be their guide,
led them by an eaſier path, than that by
which they had formerly aſcended, into the
glen. "We muſt avoid that valley to the
eaſt, my Lord," ſaid he, "or we may meet
the banditti; they went out that way in the
morning."</p>
            <p>The travellers, ſoon after, quitted this
glen, and found themſelves in a narrow valley
that ſtretched towards the north-weſt. The
morning light upon the mountains now
ſtrengthened faſt, and gradually diſcovered
the green hillocks, that ſkirted the winding
feet of the cliffs, tufted with cork tree,
and ever-green oak. The thunder-clouds
being diſperſed, had left the ſky perfectly
ſerene, and Blanche was revived by the freſh
breeze, and by the view of verdure, which
the late rain had brightened. Soon after,
the ſun aroſe, when the dripping rocks,
with, the ſhrubs. that fringed their ſummits,
and many a turfy ſlope below, ſparkled in
his rays. A wreath of miſt was ſeen, float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0247300304:285"/>
along the extremity of the valley, but
the gale bore it before the travellers, and
the ſun-beams gradually drew it up towards
the ſummit of the mountains. They had
proceeded about a league, when, St. Foix
having complained of extreme faintneſs,
they ſtopped to give him refreſhment, and,
that the men, who bore him, might reſt.
Ludovico had brought from the fort ſome
flaſks of rich Spaniſh wine, which now
proved a reviving cordial not only to St.
Foix but to the whole party, though to him
it gave only temporary relief, for it fed the
fever, that burned in his veins, and he could
neither diſguiſe in his countenance the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
he ſuffered, or ſuppreſs the wiſh, that
he was arrived at the inn, where they had
deſigned to paſs the preceding night.</p>
            <p>While they thus repoſed themſelves under
the ſhade of the dark green pines, the Count
deſired Ludovico to explain ſhortly, by what
means he had diſappeared from the north
apartment, how he came into the hands of
the banditti, and how he had contributed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0247300304:286"/>
ſo eſſentially to ſerve him and his family,
for to him he juſtly attributed their preſent
deliverance. Ludovico was going to obey
him, when ſuddenly they heard the echo of
a piſtol-ſhot, from the way they had paſſed,
and they roſe in alarm, haſtily to purſue
their route.</p>

            <p>EMILY, mean while, was ſtill ſuffering
anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt; but
Thereſa, having, at length, found a perſon,
whom ſhe could entruſt on her errand to the
ſteward, informed her, that the meſſenger
would return on the following day; and
Emily promiſed to be at the cottage,
Thereſa being too lame to attend her.</p>
            <p>In the evening, therefore, Emily ſet out
alone for the cottage, with a melancholy
foreboding, concerning Valancourt, while,
perhaps, the gloom of the hour might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to depreſs her ſpirits. It was a grey
autumnal evening towards the cloſe of the
ſeaſon; heavy miſts partially obſcured the
mountains, and a chilling breeze, that ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0247300304:288"/>
among the beech woods, ſtrewed her path
with ſome of their laſt yellow leaves. Theſe,
circling in the blaſt and foretelling the
death of the year, gave an image of deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to her mind, and, in her fancy, ſeemed
to announce the death of Valancourt. Of
this ſhe had, indeed, more than once ſo
ſtrong a preſentiment, that ſhe was on the
point of returning home, feeling herſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
to an encounter with the certainty ſhe
anticipated, but, contending with her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſhe ſo far commanded them, as to be
able to proceed.</p>
            <p>While ſhe walked mournfully on, gazing
on the long volumes, of vapour, that poured
upon the ſky and watching the ſwallows,
toſſed along the wind, now diſappearing
among tempeſtuous clouds, and then emerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for a moment, in circles upon the
calmer air, the afflictions and viciſſitudes of
her late life ſeemed pourtrayed in theſe
fleeting images;—thus had ſhe been toſſed
upon the ſtormy ſea of misfortune for the
laſt year, with but ſhort intervals of peace,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0247300304:289"/>
if peace that could be called, which was
only the delay of evils. And now, when
ſhe had eſcaped from ſo many dangers, was
become independent of the will of thoſe,
who had oppreſſed her, and found herſelf
miſtreſs of a large fortune, now, when ſhe
might reaſonably have expected happineſs,
ſhe perceived that ſhe was as diſtant from it
as ever. She would have accuſed herſelf of
weakneſs and ingratitude in thus ſuffering a
ſenſe of the various bleſſings ſhe poſſeſſed to
be overcome by that of a ſingle misfortune,
had this misfortune affected herſelf alone;
but, when she had wept for Valancourt
even as living, tears of compaſſion had
mingled with thoſe of regret, and while ſhe
lamented a human being degraded to vice,
and conſequently to miſery, reaſon and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
claimed theſe tears, and fortitude
had not yet taught her to ſeparate them
from thoſe of love; in the preſent moments,
however, it was not the certainty of his
guilt, but the apprehenſion of his death
(of a death alſo, to which ſhe herſelf, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0247300304:290"/>
innocently, appeared to have been in
ſome degree inſtrumental) that oppreſſed
her. This fear increaſed, as the means of
certainty concerning it approached; and,
when ſhe came within view of Thereſa's
cottage, ſhe was ſo much diſordered, and
her reſolution failed her ſo entirely, that,
unable to proceed, ſhe reſted on a bank,
beſide her path; where, as ſhe fat, the
wind that groaned ſullenly among the lofty
branches above, ſeemed to her melancholy
imagination to bear the founds of diſtant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and, in the pauſes of the guſt,
ſhe ſtill fancied ſhe heard the feeble and far-off
notes of diſtreſs. Attention convinced
her, that this was no more than fancy; but
the increaſing gloom, which ſeemed the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
cloſe of day, ſoon warned her to depart,
and, with faltering ſteps, ſhe again moved
toward the cottage. Through the caſement
appeared the cheerful blaze of a wood fire,
and Thereſa, who had obſerved Emily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
was already at the door to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0247300304:291"/>
"It is a cold evening, madam," ſaid
ſhe, "ſtorms are coming on, and I thought
you would like a fire. Do take this chair
by the hearth."</p>
            <p>Emily, thanking her for this conſideration,
ſat down, and then, looking in her face,
on which the wood fire threw a gleam, ſhe
was ſtruck with its expreſſion, and, unable
to ſpeak, ſunk back in her chair with a
countenance ſo full of woe, that Thereſa
inſtantly comprehended the occaſion of it,
but ſhe remained ſilent. "Ah!" ſaid Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
at length, "it is unneceſſary for me to
aſk the reſult of your enquiry, your ſilence,
and that look, ſufficiently explain it;—he
is dead!"</p>
            <p>"Alas! my dear young lady," replied
Thereſa, while tears filled her eyes, "this
world is made up of trouble! the rich have
their ſhare as well as the poor! But we
muſt all endeavour to bear what Heaven
pleaſes."</p>
            <p>"He is dead then!"—interrupted Emily—"Valancourt
is dead!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0247300304:292"/>
"A-well-a-day! I fear he is," replied
Thereſa.</p>
            <p>"You fear!" ſaid Emily, "do you only
fear?"</p>
            <p>"Alas! yes, Madam, I fear he is!
neither the ſteward, or any of the Epourville
family, have heard of him ſince he left
Languedoc, and the Count is in great afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about him, for he ſays he was always
punctual in writing, but that now he has
not received a line from him, ſince he left
Languedoc; he appointed to be at home,
three weeks ago, but he has neither come,
or written, and they fear ſome accident has
befallen him. Alas! that ever I ſhould
live to cry for his death! I am old, and
might have died without being miſſed, but
he"—Emily was faint, and aſked for
ſome water, and Thereſa, alarmed by the
voice, in which ſhe ſpoke, haſtened to her
aſſiſtance, and, while ſhe held the water to
Emily's lips, continued, "My dear young
miſtreſs do not take it ſo to heart; the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0247300304:293"/>
Chevalier may be alive and well, for all this;
let us hope the beſt!"</p>
            <p>"O no! I cannot hope," ſaid Emily,
"I am acquainted with circumſtances, that
will not ſuffer me to hope. I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better now, and can hear what you
have to ſay. Tell me, I entreat, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of what you know."</p>
            <p>"Stay till you are a little better, made-moiſelle,
you look ſadly!"</p>
            <p>"O no, Thereſa, tell me all, while I have
the power to hear it," ſaid Emily, "tell
me all, I conjure you!"</p>
            <p>"Well, madam, I will then; but the
ſteward did not ſay much, for Richard ſays
he ſeemed ſhy of talking about Monſ. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
and what he gathered was from
Gabriel, one of the ſervants, who ſaid he
had heard it from my lord's gentleman."</p>
            <p>"What did he hear?" said Emily.</p>
            <p>"Why, madam, Richard has but a bad
memory, and could not remember half of
it, and, if I had not aſked him a great
many queſtions, I ſhould have; heard little
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0247300304:294"/>
indeed. But he says that Gabriel ſaid,
that he and all the other ſervants were in
great trouble about M. Valancourt, for
that he was ſuch a kind young gentleman,
they all loved him, as well as if he had
been their own brother—and now, to think
what was become of him! For he uſed to
be ſo courteous to them all, and, if any of
them had been in fault, M. Valancourt
was the firſt to perſuade my lord to forgive
them. And then, if any poor family was
in diſtreſs, M. Valancourt was the firſt, too,
to relieve them, though ſome folks, not a
great way off, could have afforded that
much better than he. And then, ſaid Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,
he was ſo gentle to every body, and,
for all he had ſuch a noble look with him,
he never would command, and call about
him, as ſome of your quality people do,
and we never minded him the leſs for that.
Nay, ſays Gabriel, for that matter, we
minded him the more, and would all have
run to obey him at a word, ſooner than if
ſome folks had told us what to do at full
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0247300304:295"/>
length; aye, and were more afraid of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
him, too, than of them, that uſed
rough words to us."</p>
            <p>Emily, who no longer conſidered it to
be dangerous to Men to praiſe, beſtowed
on Valancourt, did not attempt to interrupt
Thereſa, but ſat, attentive to her words,
though almoſt overwhelmed with grief.
"My Lord," continued Thereſa, "frets
about M. Valancourt ſadly, and the more,
becauſe, they ſay, he had been rather harſh
againſt him lately. Gabriel ſays he had it
from my Lord's valet, that M. Valancourt
had <hi>comported</hi> himſelf wildly at Paris, and
had ſpent a great deal of money, more a
great deal than my Lord liked, for he loves
money better than M. Valancourt, who had
been led aſtray ſadly. Nay, for that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
M. Valancourt had been put into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at Paris, and my Lord, ſays Gabriel,
refuſed to take him out, and ſaid he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to ſuffer; and, when old Gregoire,
the butler, heard of this, he actually bought
a walking-ſtick to take with him to Paris,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0247300304:296"/>
to viſit his young maſter; but the next
thing we hear is, that M. Valancourt is
coming home. O, it was a joyful day
when he came; but he was ſadly altered,
and my Lord looked very cool upon him,
and he was very ſad, indeed. And, ſoon
after, he went away again into Languedoc,
and, ſince that time, we have never ſeen
him."</p>
            <p>Thereſa pauſed, and Emily, ſighing deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
remained with her eyes fixed upon the
floor, without ſpeaking. After a long
pauſe, ſhe enquired what further Thereſa
had heard. "Yet why ſhould I aſk?" ſhe
added; "what you have already told is
too much. O Valancourt! thou art gone—forever
gone! and I—I have murdered
thee!" Theſe words, and the countenance
of deſpair which accompanied them, alarmed
Thereſa, who began to fear, that the ſhock
of the intelligence Emily had juſt received,
had affected her ſenſes. "My dear young
lady, be compoſed," ſaid ſhe, "and do not
ſay ſuch frightful words. You murder
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0247300304:297"/>
M. Valancourt,—dear heart!" Emily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
only by a heavy ſigh.</p>
            <p>"Dear lady, it breaks my heart to ſee
you look ſo," ſaid Thereſa, "do not ſit
with your eyes upon the ground, and all
ſo pale and melancholy; it frightens me to
ſee you." Emily was ſtill ſilent, and did,
not appear to hear any thing that was ſaid
to her. "Beſides, mademoiſelle," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.
Thereſa, "M. Valancourt may be alive
and merry yet, for what we know."</p>
            <p>At the mention of his name, Emily
raiſed her eyes, and fixed them, in a wild
gaze, upon Thereſa, as if ſhe was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to underſtand what had been ſaid.
"Aye, my dear lady," ſaid Thereſa, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the meaning of this conſiderate air,
"M. Valancourt may be alive and merry
yet."</p>
            <p>On the repetition of theſe words, Emily
comprehended their import, but, inſtead of
producing the effect intended, they ſeemed
only to heighten her diſtreſs. She roſe haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
from her chair, paced the little room,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0247300304:298"/>
with quick ſteps, and, often ſighing deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
claſped her hands, and ſhuddered.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Thereſa, with ſimple, but
honeſt affection, endeavoured to comfort
her; put more wood on the fire, ſtirred it
up into a brighter blaze, ſwept the hearth,
ſet the chair, which Emily had left, in a
warmer ſituation, and then drew forth from
a cupboard a flaſk of wine. "It is a
ſtormy night, madam," ſaid ſhe, "and
blows cold—do come nearer the fire, and
take a glaſs of this wine; it will comfort
you, as it has done me, often and often, for
it is not ſuch wine as one gets every day;
it is rich Languedoc, and the laſt of ſix
flaſks that M. Valancourt ſent me, the
night before he left Gaſcony for Paris.
They have ſerved me, ever ſince, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials,
and I never drink it, but I think of
him, and what kind words he ſaid to me
when he gave them. Thereſa, ſays he, you
are not young now, and ſhould have a glaſs
of good wine, now and then. I will ſend
you a few flaſks, and, when you taste them,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0247300304:299"/>
you will ſometimes remember me your
friend. Yes—thoſe were his very words—me
your friend!" Emily ſtill paced the
room, without feeming to hear what The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa
ſaid, who continued ſpeaking. "And
I have remembered him, often enough,
poor young gentleman!—for he gave me
this roof for a ſhelter, and that, which has
ſupported me. Ah! he is in heaven, with
my bleſſed matter, if ever saint was!"</p>
            <p>Thereſa's voice faltered; ſhe wept, and
ſet down the flaſk, unable to pour out the
wine. Her grief ſeemed to recall Emily
from her own, who went towards her, but
then ſtopped, and, having gazed on her,
for a moment, turned ſuddenly away, as if
overwhelmed by the reflection, that it was
Valancourt, whom Thereſa lamented.</p>
            <p>While ſhe yet paced the room, the ſtill,
ſoft note of an oboe, or flute, was heard min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
with the blaſt, the ſweetneſs of which
affected Emily's ſpirits; ſhe pauſed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in attention; the tender tones, as
they ſwelled along the wind, till they were
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0247300304:300"/>
loſt again in the ruder guſt, came with a
plaintiveneſs, that touched her heart, and the
melted into tears.</p>
            <p>"Aye," ſaid Thereſa, drying her eyes,
"there is Richard, our neighbour's ſon,
playing on the oboe; it is ſad enough, to
hear ſuch ſweet muſic now." Emily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to weep, without replying. "He
often plays of an evening," added Thereſa,
"and, ſometimes, the young folks dance to
the ſound of his oboe. But, dear young lady!
do not cry ſo; and pray take a glaſs of this
wine," continued ſhe, pouring ſome into a
glaſs, and handing it to Emily, who reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly
took it.</p>
            <p>"Taſte it for M. Valancourt's ſake,"
ſaid Thereſa, as Emily lifted the glaſs to
her lips, "for he gave it me, you know,
madam." Emily's hand trembled, and ſhe
ſpilt the wine as ſhe withdrew it from her
lips. "For whoſe ſake!—who gave the
wine?" ſaid ſhe in a faltering voice. "M.
Valancourt, dear lady. I knew you would
be pleaſed with it. It is the laſt flaſk I
have left."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0247300304:301"/>
Emily ſet the wine upon the table, and
burſt into tears, while Thereſa, diſappointed
and alarmed, tried to comfort her; but ſhe
only waved her hand, entreated ſhe might
be left alone, and wept the more.</p>
            <p>A knock at the cottage door prevented
Thereſa from immediately obeying her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
and ſhe was going to open it, when
Emily, checking her, requeſted ſhe would
not admit any perſon; but, afterwards, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting,
that ſhe had ordered her ſervant to
attend her home, ſhe ſaid it was only Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippe,
and endeavoured to reſtrain her tears,
while Thereſa opened the door.</p>
            <p>A voice, that ſpoke without, drew Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's
attention. She liſtened, turned her eyes
to the door, when a perſon now appeared,
and immediately a bright gleam, that flaſhed
from the fire, diſcovered—Valancourt!</p>
            <p>Emily, on perceiving him, ſtarted from
her chair, trembled, and, ſinking into it
again, became inſenſible to all around her.</p>
            <p>A ſcream from Thereſa now told, that ſhe
knew Valancourt, whom her imperfect ſight,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0247300304:302"/>
and the duſkineſs of the place had prevented
her from immediately recollecting; but his
attention was immediately called from her
to the perſon, whom he ſaw, falling from a
chair near the fire; and, haſtening to her
aſſiſtance,—he perceived, that he was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
Emily! The various emotions, that
ſeized him upon thus unexpectedly meeting
with her, from whom he had believed he
had parted for ever, and on beholding her
pale and lifeleſs in his arms—may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
be imagined, though they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be then expreſſed, or now deſcribed,
any more than Emily's ſenſations, when, at
length, ſhe uncloſed her eyes, and, looking
up, again ſaw Valancourt. The intenſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety,
with which he regarded her, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
changed to an expreſſion of mingled
joy and tenderneſs, as his eye met hers, and
he perceived, that ſhe was reviving. But
he could only exclaim, "Emily!" as he
ſilently watched her recovery, while ſhe
averted her eye, and feebly attempted to
withdraw her hand; but, in theſe the firſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0247300304:303"/>
moments, which ſucceeded to the pangs
his ſuppoſed death had occaſioned her,
ſhe forgot every fault, which had formerly
claimed indignation, and beholding Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
ſuch as he appeared, when he won her
early affection, ſhe experienced emotions of
only tenderneſs and joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This, alas! was
but the ſunſhine of a few ſhort moments;
recollections roſe, like clouds, upon her
mind, and, darkening the illuſive image,
that poſſeſſed it, ſhe again beheld Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
degraded—Valancourt unworthy of
the eſteem and tenderneſs ſhe had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon him; her ſpirits faltered, and,
withdrawing her hand, ſhe turned from
him to conceal her grief, while he, yet
more embarraſſed and agitated, remained
ſilent.</p>
            <p>A ſenſe of what ſhe owed to herſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
her tears, and taught her ſoon to
overcome, in ſome degree, the emotions of
mingled joy and ſorrow, that contended at
her heart, as ſhe roſe, and, having thanked
him for the aſſiſtance he had given her, bade
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0247300304:304"/>
Thereſa good evening. As ſhe was leaving
the cottage, Valancourt, who ſeemed ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
awakened as from a dream, entreated,
in a voice, that pleaded powerfully for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
a few moments attention. Emily's
heart, perhaps, pleaded as powerfully, but
ſhe had reſolution enough to reſiſt both,
together with the clamorous entreaties of
Thereſa, that ſhe would not venture home
alone in the dark, and had already opened
the cottage door, when the pelting ſtorm
compelled her to obey their requeſts.</p>
            <p>Silent and embarraſſed, ſhe returned to
the fire, while Valancourt, with increaſing
agitation, paced the room, as if he wiſhed,
yet feared, to ſpeak, and Thereſa expreſſed
without reſtraint her joy and wonder upon
ſeeing him.</p>
            <p>"Dear heart! ſir," ſaid ſhe, "I never
was ſo ſurpriſed and overjoyed in my life.
We were in great tribulation before you
came, for we thought you was dead, and
were talking, and lamenting about you, juſt
when you knocked at the door. My young
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0247300304:305"/>
miſtreſs there was crying, fit to break her
heart—"</p>
            <p>Emily looked with much diſpleaſure at
Thereſa, but, before ſhe could ſpeak, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
unable to repreſs the emotion,
which Thereſa's imprudent diſcovery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned,
exclaimed, "O my Emily! am I
then ſtill dear to you! Did you, indeed,
honour me with a thought—a tear? O
heavens! you weep—you weep now!"</p>
            <p>"Thereſa, ſir," ſaid Emily, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
air, and trying to conquer her tears,
"has reaſon to remember you with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and ſhe was concerned, becauſe ſhe
had not lately heard of you. Allow me to
thank you for the kindneſs you have ſhewn
her, and to ſay, that, ſince I am now upon
the ſpot, ſhe muſt not be further indebted
to you."</p>
            <p>"Emily!" ſaid Valancourt, no longer
maſter of his emotions, "is it thus you
meet him, whom once you meant to honour
with your hand—thus you meet him, who
has loved you—ſuffered for you?—Yet what
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0247300304:306"/>
do I ſay? Pardon me, pardon me, made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle
St. Aubert, I know not what I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I have no longer any claim upon your
Remembrance—I have forfeited every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
to your eſteem, your love. Yes!
let me not forget, that I once poſſeſſed your
affections, though to know that I have loſt
them, is my ſevereſt affiction. Affliction—do
I call it!—that is a term of mildneſs."</p>
            <p>"Dear heart!" ſaid Thereſa, preventing
Emily from replying, "talk of once having
her affections! Why, my dear young lady
loves you now, better than ſhe does any
body in the whole world, though ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to deny it."</p>
            <p>"This is inſupportable!" ſaid Emily;
"Thereſa, you know not what you ſay. Sir,
if you reſpect my tranquillity, you will ſpare
me from the continuance of this diſtreſs."</p>
            <p>"I do reſpect your tranquillity too much,
voluntarily to interrupt it," replied Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
in whoſe boſom pride now contended
with tenderneſs; "and will not be a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
intruder. I would have entreated a few
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0247300304:307"/>
moments attention—yet I know not for
what purpoſe. You have ceaſed to eſteem
me, and to recount to you my ſufferings
will degrade me more, without exciting even
your pity. Yet I have been, O Emily! I
am indeed very wretched!" added Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
in a voice, that ſoftened from ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
into grief.</p>
            <p>"What! is my dear young maſter going
out in all this rain!" ſaid Thereſa. "No, he
ſhall not ſtir a ſtep. Dear! dear! to fee
how gentlefolks can afford to throw away
their happineſs! Now, if you were poor
people, there would be none of this. To
talk of unworthineſs, and not caring about
one another, when I know there are not
ſuch a kind-hearted lady and gentleman in
the whole province, nor any that love one
another half ſo well, if the truth was ſpoken!"</p>
            <p>Emily, in extreme vexation, now roſe
from her chair, "I muſt be gone," ſaid ſhe,
"the ſtorm is over."</p>
            <p>"Stay, Emily, ſtay, mademoiſelle St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert!"
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0247300304:308"/>
ſaid Valancourt, ſummoning all his
reſolution, "I will no longer diſtreſs you
by my preſence. Forgive me, that I did
not ſooner obey you, and, if you can, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
pity one, who, in loſing you—has
loſt all hope of peace! May you be happy,
Emily, however wretched I remain, happy
as my fondeſt wiſh would have you!"</p>
            <p>His voice faltered with the laſt words,
and his countenance changed, while, with
a look of ineffable tenderneſs and grief, he
gazed upon her for an inſtant, and then
quitted the cottage.</p>
            <p>"Dear heart! dear heart!" cried The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa,
following him to the door, "why,
Monſieur Valancourt! how it rains! What
a night is this to turn him out in! Why it
will give him his death; and it was but now
you was crying, mademoiſelle, becauſe he
was dead. Well! young ladies do change
their mind in a minute, as one may ſay!"</p>
            <p>Emily made no reply, for ſhe heard not
what was ſaid, while, loſt in ſorrow and
thought, ſhe remained in her chair by the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0247300304:309"/>
fire, with her eyes fixed, and the image of
Valancourt ſtill before them.</p>
            <p>"M. Valancourt is ſadly altered! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,"
ſaid Thereſa; "he looks ſo thin to
what he uſed to do, and ſo melancholy, and
then he wears his arm in a ſling."</p>
            <p>Emily raiſed her eyes at theſe words, for
ſhe had not obſerved this laſt circumſtance,
and ſhe now did not doubt, that Valancourt
had received the ſhot of her gardener at Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe;
with this conviction her pity for him
returning, ſhe blamed herſelf for having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
him to leave the cottage, during the
ſtorm.</p>
            <p>Soon after her ſervants arrived with the
carriage, and Emily, having cenſured The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa
for her thoughtleſs converſation to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
and ſtrictly charging her never to
repeat any hints of the ſame kind to him,
withdrew to her home, thoughtful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Valancourt had returned to a
little inn of the village, whither he had
arrived only a few moments before his
viſit to Thereſa's cottage, on the way
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0247300304:310"/>
from Tholouſe to the chateau of the Count
de Duvarney, where he had not been ſince
he bade adieu to Emily at Chateau-le-Blanc,
in the neighbourhood of which he
had lingered for a conſiderable time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to ſummon reſolution enough to quit
a place, that contained the object moſt
dear to his heart. There were times, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when grief and deſpair urged him to
appear again before Emily, and, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of his ruined circumſtances, to renew his
ſuit. Pride, however, and the tenderneſs
of his affection, which could not long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the thought of involving her in his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
at length, ſo far triumphed over
paſſion, that he relinquiſhed this deſperate
deſign, and quitted Chateau-le-Blanc. But
ſtill his fancy wandered among the ſcenes,
which had witneſſed his early love, and, on
his way to Gaſcony, he ſtopped at Tholouſe,
where he remained when Emily arrived, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing,
yet indulging his melancholy in the
gardens, where he had formerly paſſed with her
ſo many happy hours; often recurring, with
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0247300304:311"/>
vain regret, to the evening before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
for Italy, when ſhe had ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
met him on the terrace, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to recall to his memory every word
and look, which had then charmed him, the
arguments he had employed to diſſuade her
from the journey, and the tenderneſs of their
laſt farewel. In ſuch melancholy recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he had been indulging, when Emily
unexpectedly appeared to him on this very
terrace, the evening after her arrival at Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe.
His emotions, on thus ſeeing her,
can ſcarcely be imagined; but he ſo far
overcame the firſt promptings of love, that
he forbore to diſcover himſelf, and abruptly
quitted the gardens. Still, however, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he had ſeen haunted his mind; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more wretched than before, and the
only ſolace of his ſorrow was to return in
the ſilence or the night; to follow the
paths which he believed her ſteps had preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
during the day; and, to watch round
the habitation where ſhe repoſed. It
was in one of theſe mournful wanderings,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0247300304:312"/>
that he had received by the fire of the
gardener, who miſtook him for a robber, a
wound in his arm, which had detained
him at Tholouſe till very lately, under the
hands of a ſurgeon. There, regardleſs of
himſelf and careleſs of his friends, whoſe
late unkindneſs had urged him to believe,
that they were indifferent as to his fate, he
remained, without informing them of his
ſituation; and now, being ſufficiently reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to bear traveling, he had taken La
Vallée in his way to Eſtuviere, the Count's
reſidence, partly for the purpoſe of hearing
of Emily, and of being again near her, and
partly for that of enquiring into the ſituation
of poor old Thereſa, who, he had reaſon to
ſuppoſe, had been deprived of her ſtipend,
ſmall as it was, and which enquiry had
brought him to her cottage, when Emily
happened to be there.</p>
            <p>This unexpected interview, which had at
once ſhewn him the tenderneſs of her love
and the ſtrength of her reſolution, renewed
all the acuteneſs of the deſpair, that had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0247300304:313"/>
their former ſeparation, and which
no effort of reaſon could teach him, in theſe
moments, to ſubdue. Her image, her look,
the tones of her voice, all dwelt on his
fancy, as powerfully as they had lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to his ſenſes, and baniſhed from his
heart every emotion, except thoſe of love
and deſpair.</p>
            <p>Before the evening concluded, he returned
to Thereſa's cottage, that he might hear her
talk of Emily, and be in the place, where
ſhe had ſo lately been. The joy, felt and
expreſſed by that faithful ſervant, was
quickly changed to ſorrow, when ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
at one moment, his wild and phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
look, and, at another, the dark melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
that overhung him.</p>
            <p>After he had liſtened, and for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time, to all ſhe had to relate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Emily, he gave Thereſa nearly all
the money he had about him, though ſhe
repeatedly refuſed it, declaring, that her
miſtreſs had amply ſupplied her wants; and
then, drawing a ring of value from his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0247300304:314"/>
he delivered it her with a ſolemn charge
to preſent it to Emily, of whom he entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as a laſt favour, that ſhe would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it for his ſake, and ſometimes, when
ſhe looked upon it, remember the unhappy
giver.</p>
            <p>Thereſa wept, as ſhe received the ring,
but it was more from ſympathy, than from
any preſentiment of evil; and before ſhe
could reply, Valancourt abruptly left the
cottage. She followed him to the door,
calling upon his name and entreating him to
return; but ſhe received no anſwer, and
ſaw him no more.</p>

            <p>On the following morning, as Emily ſat
in the parlour adjoining the library, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the ſcene of the preceding night,
Annette ruſhed wildly into the room, and,
without ſpeaking, ſunk breathleſs into a
chair. It was ſome time before ſhe could
anſwer the anxious enquiries of Emily, as to
the occaſion of her emotion, but, at length,
ſhe exclaimed, "I have ſeen his ghoſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I have ſeen his ghoſt!"</p>
            <p>"Who do you mean?" ſaid Emily, with
extreme impatience.</p>
            <p>"It came, in from the hall, madam," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Annette, "as I was croſſing to the
parlour."</p>
            <p>"Who are you ſpeaking of?" repeated
Emily, "Who came in from the hall?"</p>

"It was dreſſed juſt as I have ſeen him,
often and often," added Annette. "Ah!
who could have thought—"</p>
            <p>Emily's patience was now exhauſted, and
ſhe was reprimanding her for ſuch idle
fancies, when a ſervant entered the room,
and informed her, that a ſtranger without
begged leave to ſpeak with her.</p>
            <p>It immediately occurred to Emily, that
this ſtranger was Valancourt, and ſhe told
the ſervant to inform him, that ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and could not ſee any perſon.</p>
            <p>The ſervant, having delivered his meſſage,
returned with one from the ſtranger, urging
the firſt requeſt, and ſaying, that he had
ſomething of conſequence to communicate;
while Annette, who had hitherto ſat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſilent
and amazed, now ſtarted up, and crying,
"It is Ludovico!—it is Ludovico!" ran
out of the room. Emily bade the ſervant
follow her, and, if it really was Ludovico,
to ſhew him into the parlour.</p>
            <p>In a few minutes, Ludovico appeared, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by Annette, who, as joy rendered
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0247300304:319"/>
her forgetful of all rules of decorum towards
her miſtreſs, would not ſuffer any perſon to
be heard, for ſome time, but herſelf. Emily
expreſſed ſurpriſe and ſatisfaction, on ſeeing
Ludovico in ſafety, and the firſt emotions
increaſed, when he delivered letters from
Count De Villefort and the Lady Blanche,
informing her of their late adventure, and of
their preſent ſituation at an inn among the
Pyrenées, where they had been detained by
the illneſs of Monſ. St. Foix, and the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Blanche, who added, that the
Baron St. Foix was juſt arrived to attend
his ſon to his chateau, where he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
till the perfect recovery of his wounds,
and then return to Languedoc, but that her
father and herſelf purpoſed to be at La
Vallée, on the following day. She added,
that Emily's preſence would be expected at
the approaching nuptials, and begged ſhe
would be prepared to proceed, in a few days,
to Chateau-le-Blanc. For an account of
Ludovico's adventure, ſhe referred her to
himſelf; and Emily, though much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0247300304:320"/>
concerning the means, by which he
had diſappeared from the north apartments,
had the forbearance to ſuſpend the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of her curioſity, till he had taken
ſome refreſhment, and had converſed with
Annette, whoſe joy, on ſeeing him in ſafety,
could not have been more extravagant, had
he ariſen from the grave.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Emily peruſed again the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of her friends, whoſe expreſſions of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem
and kindneſs were very neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
to her heart, awakened as it was
by the late interview to emotions of keener
ſorrow and regret.</p>
            <p>The invitation to Chateau-le-Blanc was
preſſed with ſo much kindneſs by the Count
and his daughter, who ſtrengthened it by a
meſſage from the Counteſs, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it was ſo important to her friend,
that Emily could not refuſe to accept it,
nor, though ſhe wiſhed to remain in the
quiet ſhades of her native home, could ſhe
avoid perceiving the impropriety of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there alone, ſince Valancourt was again
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0247300304:321"/>
in the neighbourhood. Sometimes, too, ſhw
thought, that change of ſcenery and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of her friends might contribute, more
than retirement, to reſtore her to tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>When Ludovico again appeared, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to give a detail of his adventure
in the north apartments, and to tell by what
means he became a companion of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti,
with whom the Count had found him.</p>
            <p>He immediately obeyed, while Annette,
who had not yet had leiſure to aſk him
many queſtions, on the ſubject, prepared
to liſten, with a countenance of extreme cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
venturing to remind her lady of her
incredulity, concerning ſpirits, in the caſtle
of Udolpho, and of her own ſagacity in
believing in them; while Emily, bluſhing
at the conſciouſneſs of her late credulity,
obſerved, that, if Ludovico's adventure
could juſtify Annette's ſupperſtition, he had
probably not been, here to relate it.</p>
            <p>Ludovico ſmiled at Annette, and bowed
to Emily, and then began as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0247300304:322"/>
"You may remember, madam, that, on
the night, when I ſat up in the north cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
my lord, the Count, and Monſ. Henri
accompanied me thither, and that, while
they remained there, nothing happened to
excite any alarm. When they were gone I
made a fire in the bed-room, and, not being
inclined to ſleep, I ſat down on the hearth
with a book I had brought with me to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
my mind. I confeſs I did ſometimes
look round the chamber, with ſomething
like apprehenſion—"</p>
            <p>"O very like it, I dare ſay," interrupted
Annette, "and I dare ſay too, if the truth
was known, you ſhook from head to foot."</p>
            <p>"Not quite ſo bad as that," replied Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,
ſmiling, "but ſeveral times, as the
wind whiſtled round the caſtle, and ſhook
the old caſements, I did fancy I heard odd
noiſes, and, once or twice, I got up and
looked about me; but nothing was to be
ſeen, except the grim figures in the tapeſtry,
which ſeemed to frown upon me, as I
looked at them. I had fat thus for above
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0247300304:323"/>
an hour," continued Ludovico, "when
again I thought I heard a noiſe, and glanced
my eyes round the room, to diſcover what
it came from, but, not perceiving any thing,
I began to read again, and, when I had
finiſhed the ſtory I was upon, I felt drowſy,
and dropped aſleep. But preſently I was
awakened by the noiſe I had heard before,
and it ſeemed to come from that part of the
chamber, where the bed ſtood; and then,
whether it was the ſtory I had been reading
that affected my ſpirits, or the ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that had been ſpread of theſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I don't know, but, when I looked
towards the bed again, I fancied I ſaw a
man's face within the duſky curtains."</p>
            <p>At the mention of this, Emily trembled,
and looked anxiouſly, remembering the
ſpectacle ſhe had herſelf witneſſed there with Dorothée.</p>
            <p>"I confeſs, madam, my heart did fail
me, at that inſtant," continued Ludovico,
"but a return of the noiſe drew my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0247300304:324"/>
from the bed, and I then diſtinctly
heard a ſound, like that of a key, turning
in a lock, but what ſurpriſed me more was,
that I ſaw no door where the ſound ſeemed
to come from. In the next moment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the arras near the bed was ſlowly
lifted, and a perſon appeared behind it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
from a ſmall door in the wall. He
ſtood for a moment as if half retreating,
with his head bending under the arras which
concealed the upper part of his face except
his eyes ſcowling beneath the tapeſtry as he
held it; and then, while he raiſed it higher,
I ſaw the face of another man behind, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over his ſhoulder. I know not how it
was, but, though my ſword was upon the
table before me, I had not the power juſt
then to ſeize it, but ſat quite ſtill, watching
them, with my eyes half ſhut as if I was
aſleep. I ſuppoſe they thought me ſo, and
were debating what they ſhould do, for I
heard them whiſper, and they ſtood in the
ſame poſture for the value of a minute, and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0247300304:325"/>
then, I thought I perceived other faces in
the duſkineſs beyond the door, and heard
louder whiſpers."</p>
            <p>"This door ſurprifes me," ſaid Emily,
"becauſe I underſtood, that the Count
had cauſed the arras to be lifted, and the
walls examined, ſuſpecting, that they might
have concealed a paſſage through which
you had departed."</p>
            <p>"It does not appear ſo extraordinary to
me, madam," replied Ludovico, "that this
door ſhould eſcape notice, becauſe it was
formed in a narrow compartment, which
appeared to be part of the outward wall,
and, if the Count had not paſſed over it,
he might have thought it was uſeleſs to
ſearch for a door where it ſeemed as if no
paſſage could communicate, with one; but
the truth was, that the paſſage was formed
within the wall itſelf.—But, to return to
the men, whom I ſaw obſcurely beyond
the door, and who did not ſuffer me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
long in ſuſpenſe, concerning their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
They all ruſhed into the room, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0247300304:326"/>
ſurrounded me, though not before I had
ſnatched up my ſword to defend myſelf.
But what could one man do againſt four?
They ſoon diſarmed me, and, having faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
my arms, and gagged my mouth,
forced me through the private door, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſword upon the table, to aſſiſt, as
they ſaid, thoſe who ſhould come in the
morning to look for me, in fighting againſt
the ghoſts. They then led me through
many narrow paſſages, cut, as I fancied,
in the walls, for I had never ſeen them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and down ſeveral flights of ſteps, till
we came to the vaults underneath the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
and then opening a ſtone door, which
I ſhould have taken for the wall itſelf, we
went through a long paſſage, and down
other ſteps cut in the ſolid rock, when
another door delivered us into a cave. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
turning and twining about, for ſome
time, we reached the mouth of it, and I
found myſelf on the ſea-beach at the foot
of the cliffs, with the chateau above. A
boat was in waiting, into which the ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0247300304:327"/>
got, forcing me along with them, and
we ſoon reached a ſmall veſſel, that was at
anchor, where other men appeared, when
ſetting me aboard, two of the fellows who
had ſeized me, followed, and the other two
rowed back to the ſhore, while we ſet fail.
I ſoon found out what all this meant, and
what was the buſineſs of theſe men at the
chateau. We landed in Rouſillon, and,
after lingering ſeveral days about the ſhore,
ſome of their comrades came down from
the mountains, and carried me with them
to the fort, where I remained till my Lord
ſo unexpectedly arrived, for they had taken
good care to prevent my running away,
having blindfolded me, during the journey,
and, if they had not done this, I think I
never could have found my road to any
town, through the wild country we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.
After I reached the fort I was
watched like a priſoner, and never ſuffered
to go out, without two or three compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and I became ſo weary of life, that I
often wiſhed to get rid of it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0247300304:328"/>
"Well, but they let you talk," ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette,
"they did not gagg you after they
got you away from the chateau, ſo I don't
ſee what reaſon there was to be ſo very
weary of living; to ſay nothing about the
chance you had of feeing me again."</p>
            <p>Ludovico ſmiled, and Emily alſo, who
enquired what was the motive of theſe men
for carrying him off.</p>
            <p>"I ſoon found out, madam," reſumed Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,
"that they were pirates, who had,
during many years, ſecreted their ſpoil in
the vaults of the caſtle, which, being ſo
near the ſea, ſuited their purpoſe well. To
prevent detection they had tried to have it
believed, that the chateau was haunted, and,
having diſcovered the private way to the
north apartments, which had been ſhut
up ever ſince the death of the lady mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
they eaſily ſucceeded. The houſe-keeper
and her huſband, who were the
only perſons, that had inhabited the caſtle,
for ſome years, were ſo terrified by the
ſtrange noiſes they heard in the nights, that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0247300304:329"/>
they would live there no longer; a report
ſoon went abroad, that it was haunted, and
the whole country believed this the more
readily, I ſuppoſe, becauſe it had been ſaid,
that the lady marchioneſs had died in a
ſtrange way, and becauſe my lord never
would return to the place afterwards."</p>
            <p>"But why," ſaid Emily, "were not theſe
pirates contented with the cave—why did
they think it neceſſary to depoſit their ſpoil
in the caſtle?"</p>
            <p>"The cave, madam," replied Ludovico,
"was open to any body, and their treaſures
would not long have remained undiſcovered
there, but in the vaults they were ſecure ſo
long as the report prevailed of their being
haunted. Thus then, it appears, that they
brought at midnight, the ſpoil they took on
the ſeas, and kept it till they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of diſpoſing of it to advantage.
The pirates were connected with Spanish
ſmugglers and banditti, who live among the
wilds of the Pyrenées, and carry on various
kinds of traffic, ſuch as nobody would think
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0247300304:330"/>
of; and with this deſperate horde of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti
I remained, till my lord arrived. I ſhall
never forget what I felt, when I firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
him—I almoſt gave him up for
loſt! but I knew, that, if I ſhewed myſelf,
the banditti would diſcover who he was,
and probably murder us all, to prevent
their ſecret in the chateau being detected. I,
therefore, kept out of my lord's ſight, but
had a ſtrict watch upon the ruſſians, and
determined, if they offered him or his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
violence, to diſcover myſelf, and fight
for our lives. Soon after, I overheard
ſome of them laying a moſt diabolical plan
for the murder and plunder of the whole
party, when I contrived to ſpeak to ſome of
my lord's attendants, telling them what was
going forward, and we conſulted what was
beſt to be done; meanwhile my lord,
alarmed at the abſence of the Lady Blanche,
demanded her, and the ruſſians having
given ſome unſatisfactory anſwer, my lord
and Monſ. St. Foix became furious, ſo
then we thought it a good time to diſcover
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0247300304:331"/>
the plot, and ruſhing into the chamber, I
called out "Treachery! my lord count, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
yourſelf!" His lordſhip and the
chevalier drew their ſwords directly, and a
hard battle we had, but we conquered at
laſt, as, madam, you are already informed
of by my Lord Count."</p>
            <p>"This is an extraordinary adventure,"
ſaid Emily, and much praiſe is due, Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico,
to your prudence and intrepidity.
There are ſome cifcumſtances, however,
concerning the north apartments, which ſtill
perplex me; but, perhaps, you may be able
to explain them. Did you ever hear the
banditti relate any thing extraordinary of
theſe rooms."</p>
            <p>"No, madam," replied Ludovico, "I
never heard them ſpeak about the rooms,
except to laugh at the credulity of the old
houſekeeper, who once was very near catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the pirates; it was ſince the
Count arrived at the chateau, he ſaid, and
he laughed heartily as he related the trick
he had played off."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0247300304:332"/>
A bluſh overſpread Emily's cheek, and
ſhe impatiently deſired Ludovico to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
himſelf.</p>
            <p>"Why, my lady," ſaid he, "as this
fellow was, one night in the bed-room, he
heard ſomebody approaching through the
next apartment, and not having time to lift
up the arras, and unfaſten the door, he hid
himſelf in the bed juſt by. There he lay
for ſome time in as great a fright, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe—"</p>
            <p>"As you was in," interrupted Annette,
"when you ſat up ſo boldly to watch by
yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"Aye," ſaid Ludovico," in as great a
fright as he ever made any body elſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
and preſently the houſekeeper and ſome
other perſon came up to the bed, when
he, thinking they were going to examine
it, bethought him, that his only chance of
eſcaping detection, was by terrrifying them;
ſo he lifted up the counterpane, but that
did not do, till he raiſed his face above
it, and then they both ſet off, he ſaid, as if
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0247300304:333"/>
they had ſeen the devil, and he got out of
the rooms undiſcovered."</p>
            <p>Emily could not forbear ſmiling at this
explanation of the deception, which had
given her ſo much ſuperſtitious terror; and
was ſurpriſed, that ſhe could have ſuffered
herſelf to be thus alarmed, till ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that, when the mind has Once begun
to yield to the weakneſs of ſuperſtition,
trifles impreſs it with the force of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Still, however, ſhe remembered with
awe the myſterious muſic, which had
been heard, at midnight, near Chateau-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Blanc,
and ſhe aſked Ludovico if he could
give any explanation of it; but he could
not.</p>
            <p>"I only know, madam," he added,
"that it did not belong to the pirates, for I
have heard them laugh about it, and ſay,
they believed the devil was in league with
them there."</p>
            <p>"Yes, I will anſwer for it he was," ſaid
Annette, her countenance brightening, "I
was ſure all along, that he or his ſpirits
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0247300304:334"/>
had ſomething to do with the north apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and now you ſee, madam, I am
right at laſt."</p>
            <p>"It cannot be denied, that his ſpirits
were very buſy in that part of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,"
replied Emily, ſmiling. "But I am
ſurpriſed, Ludovico, that theſe pirates
ſhould perſevere in their ſchemes, after the
arrival of the Count; what could they
expect but certain detection?"</p>
            <p>"I have reaſon to believe, madam," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Ludovico, "that it was their intention
to perſevere no longer than was neceſſary
for the removal of the ſtores, which were
depoſited in the vaults; and it appeared,
that they had been employed in doing ſo
from within a ſhort period after the Count's
arrival; but, as they had only a few hours
in the night for this buſineſs, and were
carrying on other ſchemes at the ſame time,
the vaults were not above half emptied,
when they took me away. They gloried
exceedingly in this opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the ſuperſtitious reports, that had
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0247300304:335"/>
been ſpread of the north chambers, were
careful to leave every thing there as they had
found it, the better to promote the decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and frequently, in their jocoſe moods,
would laugh at the conſternation, which
they believed the inhabitants of the caſtle
had ſuffered upon my diſappearing, and it
was to prevent the poſſibility of my betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſecret, that they had removed me
to ſuch a diſtance. From that period they
conſidered the chateau as nearly their own;
but I found from the diſcourſe of their
comrades, that, though they were cautious,
at firſt, in ſhewing their power there, they
had once very nearly betrayed themſelves.
Going, one night, as was their cuſtom, to
the north chambers to repeat the noiſes,
that had occaſioned ſuch alarm among the
ſervants, they heard, as they were about to
unfaſten the ſecret door, voices in the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room.
My lord has ſince told me, that
himſelf and M. Henri were then in the
apartment, and they heard very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſounds of lamentation, which it ſeems
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0247300304:336"/>
were made by theſe fellows, with their uſual
deſign of ſpreading terror; and my lord
has owned, he then felt ſomewhat more,
than ſurpriſe; but, as it was neceſſary to
the peace of his family, that no notice
ſhould be taken, he was ſilent on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and enjoined ſilence to his ſon."</p>
            <p>Emily, recollecting the change, that had
appeared in the ſpirits of the Count, after
the night, when he had watched in the
north room, now perceived the cauſe of it;
and, having made ſome further enquiries
upon this ſtrange affair, ſhe diſmiſſed Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,
and went to give orders for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of her friends, on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
day.</p>
            <p>In the evening, Thereſa, lame as ſhe was,
came to deliver the ring, with which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
had entruſted her, and, when ſhe
preſented it, Emily was much affected, for
ſhe remembered to have ſeen him wear it
often in happier days. She was, however,
much diſpleaſed, that Thereſa had received
it, and poſitively refuſed to accept it her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0247300304:337"/>
though to have done ſo would have
afforded her a melancholy pleaſure. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa
entreated, expoſtulated, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
the diſtreſs of Valancourt, when he
had given the ring, and repeated the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
with which he had commiſſioned her
to deliver it; and Emily could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the extreme ſorrow this recital occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
her, but wept, and remained loſt in
thought.</p>
            <p>"Alas! my dear young lady!" ſaid The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa,
"why ſhould all this be? I have
known you from your infancy, and it may
well be ſuppoſed I love you, as if you was
my own, and wiſh as much to ſee you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
M. Valancourt, to be ſure, I have
not known ſo long, but then I have reaſon
to love him, as though he was my own ſon.
I know how well you love one another, or
why all this weeping and wailing?" Emily
waved her hand for Thereſa to be ſilent,
who, diſregarding the ſignal, continued,
"And how much you are alike in your
tempers and ways, and, that, if you were
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0247300304:338"/>
married, you would be the happieſt couple
in the whole province—then what is there
to prevent your marrying? Dear dear! to
ſee how ſome people fling away their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and then cry and lament about it,
juſt as if it was not their own doing, and
as if there was more pleaſure in wailing and
weeping, than in being at peace. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to be ſure, is a fine thing, but, if it
teaches folks no better than that, why I
had rather be without it; if it would teach
them to be happier, I would ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to it, then it would be learning and
wiſdom too."</p>
            <p>Age and long ſervices had given Thereſa
a privilege to talk, but Emily now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to check her loquacity, and, though
ſhe felt the juſtneſs of ſome of her remarks,
did not chooſe to explain the circumſtances,
that had determined her conduct towards Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt.
She, therefore, only told Thereſa,
that it would much diſpleaſe her to hear
the ſubject renewed; that ſhe had reaſons
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0247300304:339"/>
for her conduct, which ſhe did not think it
proper to mention, and that the ring muſt
be returned, with an aſſurance, that ſhe
could not accept it with propriety; and, at
the ſame time, ſhe forbade Thereſa to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
any future meſſage from Valancourt,
as ſhe valued her eſteem and kindneſs.
Thereſa was afflicted, and made another
attempt, though feeble, to intereſt her for
Valancourt, but the unuſual diſpleaſure,
expreſſed in Emily's countenance, ſoon
obliged her to deſiſt, and ſhe departed in
wonder and lamentation.</p>
            <p>To relieve her mind, in ſome degree, from
the painful recollections, that intruded upon
it, Emily buſied herſelf in preparations for
the journey into Languedoc, and, while An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette,
who aſſiſted her, ſpoke with joy and
affection of the ſafe return of Ludovico,
ſhe was conſidering how ſhe might beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their happineſs, and determined, if it
appeared, that his affection was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
as that of the ſimple and honeſt
Annette, to give her a marriage portion,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0247300304:340"/>
and ſettle them on ſome part of her eſtate.
Theſe conſiderations led her to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of her father's paternal domain,
which his affairs had formerly compelled
him to diſpoſe of to M. Queſnel, and which
ſhe frequently wiſhed to regain, becauſe St.
Aubert had lamented, that the chief lands
of his anceſtors had paſſed into another
family, and becauſe they had been his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
and the haunt of his early years.
To the eſtate at Tholouſe ſhe had no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
attachment, and it was her wiſh to
diſpoſe of this, that ſhe might purchaſe her
paternal domains, if M. Queſnel could be
prevailed on to part with them, which, as he
talked much of living in Italy, did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very improbable.</p>

            <p>On the following day, the arrival of her
friend revived the drooping Emily, and La
Vallée became once more the ſcene of ſocial
kindneſs and of elegant hoſpitality. Illneſs
and the terror ſhe had ſuffered had ſtolen
from Blanche much of her ſprightlineſs, but
all her affectionate ſimplicity remained, and,
though ſhe appeared leſs blooming, ſhe was
not leſs engaging than before. The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
adventure on the Pyrenées had made
the Count very anxious to reach home, and,
after little more than a week's ſtay at La
Vallée, Emily prepared to ſet out with her
friends for Languedoc, aſſigning the care of
her houſe, during her abſence, to Thereſa.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0247300304:342"/>
On the evening, preceding her departure,
this old ſervant brought again the ring of
Valancourt, and, with tears, entreated her
miſtreſs to receive it, for that ſhe had neither
ſeen, or heard of M. Valancourt, ſince the
night when he delivered it to her. As ſhe ſaid
this, her countenance expreſſed more alarm,
than ſhe dared to utter; but Emily, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her own propenſity to fear, conſidered,
that he had probably returned to the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his brother, and, again refuſing to
accept the ring, bade Thereſa preſerve it,
till ſhe ſaw him, which, with extreme reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſhe promiſed to do.</p>
            <p>On the following day, Count De Villefort,
with Emily and the Lady Blanche, left La
Vallée, and, on the enſuing evening, arrived
at the Chateau-le-Blanc, where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs,
Henri, and M. Du Pont, whom Emily
was ſurpriſed to find there, received them
with much joy and congratulation. She
was concerned to obſerve, that the Count
ſtill encouraged the hopes of his friend,
whoſe countenance declared, that his affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0247300304:343"/>
had ſuffered no abatement from abſence;
and was much diſtreſſed, when, on the ſecond
evening after her arrival, the Count, having
withdrawn her from the Lady Blanche, with
whom ſhe was walking, renewed the ſubject
of M. Du Pont's hopes. The mildneſs,
with which ſhe liſtened to his interceſſions
at firſt, deceiving him, as to her ſentiments,
he began to believe, that, her affection for
Valancourt being overcome, ſhe was, at
length, diſpoſed to think favourably of M.
Du Pont; and, when ſhe afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him of his miſtake, he ventured, in
the earneſtneſs of his wiſh to promote what
he conſidered to be the happineſs of two
perſons, whom he ſo much eſteemed, gently
to remonſtrate with her, on thus ſuffering an
ill-placed affection to poiſon the happineſs
of her moſt valuable years.</p>
            <p>Obſerving her ſilence and the deep dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her countenance, he concluded with
ſaying, "I will not ſay more now, but I
will ſtill believe, my dear Mademoiſelle St.
Aubert, that you will nor always reject a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0247300304:344"/>
perſon, ſo truly eſtimable as my friend Du
Pont."</p>
            <p>He ſpared her the pain of replying, by
leaving her; and ſhe ſtrolled on, ſomewhat
diſpleaſed with the Count for having perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to plead for a ſuit, which ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly
rejected, and loſt amidſt the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
recollections, which this topic had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
till ſhe had inſenſibly reached the
borders of the woods, that ſcreened the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
of St. Clair, when, perceiving how
far ſhe had wandered, ſhe determined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
her walk a little farther, and to enquire
after the abbeſs and ſome of her friends
among the nuns.</p>
            <p>Though the evening was now drawing to
a cloſe, ſhe accepted the invitation of the
friar, who opened the gate, and, anxious to
meet ſome of her old acquaintance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
towards the convent parlour. As
ſhe croſſed the lawn, that ſtoped from the
front of the monaſtery towards the ſea, ſhe
was ſtruck with the picture of repoſe, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by ſome monks, ſitting in the cloiſters,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0247300304:345"/>
which extended under the brew of the
woods, that crowned this eminence; where,
as they meditated, at this twilight hour,
holy ſubjects, they ſometimes ſuffered their
attention to be relieved by the ſcene before
them, nor thought it profane to look at na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
now that it had exchanged the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
colours of day for the ſober hue of
evening. Before the cloiſters, however,
ſpread an ancient cheſnut, whoſe ample
branches were deſigned to ſcreen the full
magnificence of a ſcene, that might tempt
the wiſh to worldly pleaſures; but ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the dark and ſpreading foliage, gleam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a wide extent of ocean, and many a paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſail; while, to the right and left, thick
woods were ſeen ſtretching along the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhores. So much as this had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
perhaps, to give to the ſecluded vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
an image of the dangers and viciſſitudes
of life, and to conſole him, now that he had
renounced its pleaſures, by the certainty of
having eſcaped its evils. As Emily walked
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0247300304:346"/>
penſively along, conſidering how much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
ſhe might have eſcaped, had ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a votareſs of the order, and remained
in this retirement from the time of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
death, the veſper-bell ſtruck up, and
the monks retired ſlowly toward the chapel,
while ſhe, purſuing her way, entered the
great hall, where an unuſual ſilence ſeemed
to reign. The parlour too, which opened
from it, ſhe found vacant, but, as the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bell was ſounding, ſhe believed the
nuns had withdrawn into the chapel, and
ſat down to reſt, for a moment, before ſhe
returned to the chateau, where, however,
the increaſing gloom made her now anxious
to be.</p>
            <p>Not many minutes had elapſed, before a
nun, entering in haſte, enquired for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,
and was retiring, without recollecting
Emily, when ſhe made herſelf known, and
then learned, that a maſs was going to be
performed for the ſoul of ſiſter Agnes, who
had been declining, for ſome time, and who
was now believed to be dying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0247300304:347"/>
Of her ſufferings the ſiſter gave a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
account, and of the horrors, into which
ſhe had frequently ſtarted, but which had
now yielded to a dejection ſo gloomy, that
neither the prayers, in which ſhe was joined
by the ſiſterhood, or the aſſurances of her
confeſſor, had power to recall her from it,
or to cheer her mind even with a momentary
gleam of comfort.</p>
            <p>To this relation Emily liſtened with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
concern, and, recollecting the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zied
manners and the expreſſions of horror,
which ſhe had herſelf witneſſed of Agnes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the hiſtory, that ſiſter Frances had
communicated, her compaſſion was height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
to a very painful degree. As the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was already far advanced, Emily did
not now deſire to ſee her, or to join in the
maſs, and, after leaving many kind remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
with the nun, for her old friends,
ſhe quitted the monaſtery, and returned over
the cliffs toward the chateau, meditating
upon what ſhe had juſt: heard, till, at length
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0247300304:348"/>
ſhe forced her mind upon leſs intereſting
ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The wind was high, and as ſhe drew near
the chateau, ſhe often pauſed to liſten to
its awful ſound, as it ſwept over the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that beat below, or groaned along the
ſurrounding woods; and, while ſhe reſted
on a cliff at a ſhort diſtance from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
and looked upon the wide waters, ſeen
dimly beneath the laſt ſhade of twilight, ſhe
thought of the following addreſs.</p>

            <p>ON the following evening, the view of
the convent towers, riſing among the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy
woods, reminded Emily of the nun,
whoſe condition had ſo much affected her;
and, anxious to know how ſhe was, as well
as to ſee ſome of her former friends, ſhe
and the Lady Blanche extended their walk
to the monaſtery. At the gate ſtood a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which, from the heat of the horſes,
appeared to have juſt arrived; but a more
than common ſtillneſs pervaded the court
and the cloiſters, through which Emily and
Blanche paſſed in their way to the great
hall, where a nun, who was croſſing to the
ſtair-caſe, replied to the enquiries of the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0247300304:351"/>
former, that ſiſter Agnes was ſtill living,
and ſenſible, but that it was thought ſhe
could not ſurvive the night. In the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
they found ſeveral of the boarders,
who rejoiced to see Emily, and told her
many little circumſtances that had happened
in the convent ſince her departure, and
which were intereſting to her only becauſe
they related to perſons, whom ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
with affection. While they thus
converſed, the abbeſs entered the room,
and expreſſed much ſatisfaction at ſeeing
Emily, but her manner was unuſually ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn,
and her countenance dejected. "Our
houſe," ſaid ſhe, after the firſt ſalutations
were over, "is truly a houſe of mourning—a
daughter is now paying the debt of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—You
have heard, perhaps, that our
daughter Agnes is dying?"</p>
            <p>Emily expreſſed her ſincere concern.</p>
            <p>"Her death preſents to us a great and
awful leſſon," continued the abbeſs; "let
us read it, and profit by it; let it teach us
to prepare ourſelves for the change, that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0247300304:352"/>
awaits us all! You are young, and have it
yet in your power to ſecure "the peace
that paſſeth all underſtanding"—the peace
of conſcience. Preſerve it in your youth,
that it may comfort you in age; for vain,
alas! and imperfect are the good deeds of
our latter years, if thoſe of our early life
have been evil!"</p>
            <p>Emily would have ſaid, that good deeds,
ſhe hoped, were never vain; but ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that it was the abbeſs who ſpoke, and
ſhe remained ſilent.</p>
            <p>"The latter days of Agnes," reſumed
the abbeſs, "have been exemplary; would
they might atone for the errors of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ones! Her ſufferings now, alas! are
great; let us believe, that they will make
her peace hereafter! I have left her with
her confeſſor, and a gentleman, whom ſhe
has long been anxious to ſee, and who is juſt
arrived from Paris. They, I hope, will be
able to adminiſter the repoſe, which her
mind has hitherto wante!"</p>
            <p>Emily ſervently joined in the wiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0247300304:353"/>
"During her illneſs, ſhe has ſometimes
named you," reſumed the abbeſs; "per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
it would comfort her to ſee you;
when her preſent viſitors have left her, we
will go to her chamber, if the ſcene will not
be too melancholy for your ſpirits. But,
indeed, to ſuch ſcenes, however painful, we
ought to accuſtom ourſelves, for they are
ſalutary to the ſoul, and prepare us for
what we are ourſelves to ſuffer."</p>
            <p>Emily became grave and thoughtful;
for this converſation brought to her recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
the dying moments of her beloved
father, and ſhe wiſhed once more to weep
over the ſpot, where his remains were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
During the ſilence, which followed
the abbeſs's ſpeech, many minute circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
attending his laſt hours occurred to
her—his emotion on perceiving himſelf to
be in the neighbourhood of Chateau-le-Blanc—his
requeſt to be interred in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſpot in the church of this monaſtery—and
the ſolemn charge he had delivered
her to deſtroy certain papers, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0247300304:354"/>
them.—She recollected alſo the
myſterious and horrible words in thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts,
upon which her eye had involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
glanced; and, though they now, and,
indeed, whenever ſhe remembered them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
an exceſs of painful curioſity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their full import, and the motives
for her father's command, it was ever her
chief conſolation, that ſhe had ſtrictly obeyed
him in this particular.</p>
            <p>Little more was ſaid by the abbeſs, who
appeared too much affected by the ſubject
ſhe had lately left, to be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and her companions had been for
ſome time ſilent from the ſame cauſe, when
this general reverie was interrupted by the
entrance of a ſtranger, Monſieur Bonnac,
who had juſt quitted the chamber of ſiſter
Agnes. He appeared much diſturbed,
but Emily fancied, that his countenance
had more the expreſſion of horror, than
of grief. Having drawn the abbeſs to a
diſtant part of the room, he converſed with
her for ſome time, during which ſhe ſeemed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0247300304:355"/>
to liſten with earneſt attention, and he to
ſpeak with caution, and a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
degree of intereſt. When he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
he bowed ſilently to the reſt of the
company, and quitted the room. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,
ſoon after, propoſed going to the
chamber of ſiſter Agnes, to which Emily
conſented, though not without ſome reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Lady Blanche remained with
the boarders below.</p>
            <p>At the door of the chamber they met
the confeſſor, whom, as he lifted up his
head on their approach, Emily obſerved to
be the ſame that had attended her dying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but he passed on, without noticing
her, and they entered the apartment, where,
on a mattreſs, was laid sifter Agnes, with
one nun watching in the chair beside her.
Her countenance was ſo much, changed,
that Emily would ſcarcely have recollected
her, had ſhe not been prepared to do ſo:
it was ghaſtly, and overſpread with gloomy
horror; her dim and hollow eyes were fixed
on a crucifix, which ſhe held upon her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0247300304:356"/>
and ſhe was ſo much engaged in
thought, as not to perceive the abbeſs and
Emily, till they stood at the bed-ſide,
Then, turning her heavy eyes, ſhe fixed
them, in wild horror, upon Emily; and,
ſcreaming, exclaimed, "Ah! that viſion
comes upon me in my dying hours!"</p>
            <p>Emily ſtarted back in terror, and looked
for explanation to the abbeſs, who made her
a ſignal not to be alarmed, and calmly ſaid
to Agnes, "Daughter, I have brought
Mademoiſelle St. Aubert to viſit you: I
thought you would be glad to ſee her."</p>
            <p>Agnes made no reply; but, ſtill gazing
wildly upon Emily, exclaimed, "It is her
very ſelf! Oh! there is all that faſcination
in her look, which proved my deſtruction!
What would you have—what is it you
come to demand—Retribution?—It will
ſoon be yours—it is yours already. How
many years have paſſed, ſince laſt I ſaw
you! My crime is but as yeſterday.—Yet
I am grown old beneath it; while you
are ſtill young and blooming—blooming as
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0247300304:357"/>
when you forced me to commit that moſt
abhorred deed! O! could I once forget it!—yet
what would that avail?—the deed is
done!"</p>
            <p>Emily, extremely ſhocked, would now
have left the room; but the abbeſs, taking
her hand, tried to ſupport her ſpirits, and
begged ſhe would ſtay a few moments,
when Agnes would probably be calm,
whom now ſhe tried to ſooth, But the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeemed to diſregard her, while ſhe ſtill
fixed her eyes on Emily, and added,
"What are years of prayers and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?
they cannot waſh out the foulneſs of
murder!—Yes, murder! Where is he—where
is he?—Look there—look there!—ſee
where he ſtalks along the room! Why
do you come to torment me now?" conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Agnes, while her ſtraining eyes were
bent on air, "why was not I puniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?—O!
do not frown ſo ſternly! Hah!
there again! 'tis ſhe herſelf! Why do you
look ſo piteouſly upon me—and ſmile, too?
ſmile on me! What groan was that?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0247300304:358"/>
Agnes ſunk down, apparently lifeleſs,
and Emily, unable to ſupport herſelf, leaned
againſt the bed, while the abbeſs and the
attendant nun were applying the uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
to Agnes. "Peace," ſaid the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,
when Emily was going to ſpeak,
"the delirium is going off, ſhe will ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive.
When was ſhe thus before, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?"</p>
            <p>"Not of many weeks, madam," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the nun,"but her ſpirits have been
much agitated by the arrival of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhe wiſhed ſo much to ſee."</p>
            <p>"Yes," obſerved the abbeſs, "that has
undoubtedly occaſioned this paroxyſm of
frenzy. When ſhe is better, we will leave
her to repoſe."</p>
            <p>Emily very readily conſented, but, though
ſhe could now give little aſſiſtance, ſhe was
unwilling to quit the chamber, while any
might be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>When Agnes recovered her ſenſes, ſhe
again fixed her eyes on Emily, but their
wild expreſſion was gone, and a gloomy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0247300304:359"/>
had ſucceeded. It was ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
before ſhe recovered ſufficient ſpirits
to ſpeak; ſhe then ſaid feebly—"The
likeneſs is wonderful!—ſurely it muſt be
ſomething more than fancy. Tell me, I
conjure you," ſhe added, addreſſing Emily,
"though your name is St. Aubert, are you
not the daughter of the Marchioneſs?"
"What Marchioneſs?" ſaid Emily, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
ſurpriſe; for ſhe had imagined, from
the calmneſs of Agnes's manner, that her
intellects were reſtored, The abbeſs gave
her a ſignificant glance, but ſhe repeated
the queſtion.</p>
            <p>"What Marchioneſs?" exclaimed Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
"I know but of one—the Marchioneſs
de Villeroi."</p>
            <p>Emily, remembering the emotion of her
late father, upon the unexpected mention
of this lady, and his requeſt to be laid near
the tomb of the Villerois, now felt greatly
intereſted, and ſhe entreated Agnes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the reaſon of her queſtion. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs
would now have withdrawn Emily
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0247300304:360"/>
from the room, who being, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by a ſtrong intereſt, repeated her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties.</p>
            <p>"Bring me that caſket, ſiſter," ſaid Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
"I will ſhew her to you; yet you
need only look in that mirror, and you will
behold her; you ſurely are her daughter:
ſuch ſtriking reſemblance is never found
but among near relations."</p>
            <p>The nun brought the caſket, and Agnes,
having directed her how to unlock it, ſhe
took thence a miniature, in which Emily
perceived the exact reſemblance of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which ſhe had found among her late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
papers. Agnes held out her hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it; gazed upon it earneſtly for ſome
moments in ſilence; and then, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of deep deſpair, threw up her eyes to
Heaven, and prayed inwardly. When ſhe
had finiſhed, ſhe returned the miniature to
Emily. "Keep it," ſaid ſhe, "I bequeath
it to you, for I muſt believe it is your
right. I have frequently obſerved the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
between you; but never, till this
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0247300304:361"/>
day, did it ſtrike upon my conſcience ſo
powerfully! Stay, ſiſter, do not remove the
caſket—there is another picture I would
ſhew."</p>
            <p>Emily trembled with expectation, and
the abbeſs again would have withdrawn her.
"Agnes is ſtill diſordered," ſaid ſhe, "you
obſerve how ſhe wanders. In theſe moods
ſhe ſays any thing, and does not ſcruple,
as you have witneſſed, to accuſe herſelf of
the moſt horrible crimes."</p>
            <p>Emily, however, thought ſhe perceived
ſomething more than madneſs in the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies
of Agnes, whoſe mention of the
Marchioneſs, and production of her picture,
had intereſted her ſo much, that ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to obtain further information, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
reſpecting the ſubject of it.</p>
            <p>The nun returned with the caſket, and,
Agnes pointing out to her a ſecret drawer,
ſhe took from it another miniature. "Here,"
ſaid Agnes, as ſhe offered it to Emily,
"learn a leſſon for your vanity, at leaſt;
look well at this picture, and see if you can
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0247300304:362"/>
diſcover any reſemblance between what I
was, and what I am"</p>
            <p>Emily impatiently received the miniature,
which her eyes had ſcarcely glanced upon,
before her trembling hands had nearly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to fall—it was the reſemblance of
the portrait of Signora Laurentini, which
ſhe had formerly ſeen in the caſtle of Udol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho—the
lady, who had diſappeared in ſo
myſterious a manner, and whom Montoni
had been ſuſpected of having cauſed to be
murdered.</p>
            <p>In ſilent aſtoniſhment, Emily continued
to gaze alternately upon the picture and the
dying nun, endeavouring to trace a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
between them, which no longer
exiſted.</p>
            <p>"Why do you look ſo ſternly on me?"
ſaid Agnes, miſtaking the nature of Emily's
emotion.</p>
            <p>"I have ſeen this face before" ſaid
Emily, at length; "was it really your
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance?"</p>
            <p>"You may well aſk that queſtion," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0247300304:363"/>
the nun,—"but it was once eſteemed
a ſtriking likeneſs of me. Look at me
well, and ſee what guilt has made me. I
then was innocent; the evil paſſions of my
nature ſlept. Siſter!" added ſhe ſolemnly,
and ſtretching forth her cold, damp hand to
Emily, who ſhuddered at its touch—"Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!
beware of the firſt indulgence of the
paſſions; beware of the firſt! Their courſe,
if not checked then, is rapid—their force is
uncontroulable—they lead us we know not
whither—they lead us perhaps to the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of crimes, for which whole years of
prayer and penitence cannot atone!—Such
may be the force of even a ſingle paſſion,
that it overcomes every other, and ſears up
every other approach to the heart.
Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
us like a fiend, it leads us on to the
acts of a fiend, making us inſenſible to pity
and to conſcience. And, when its purpoſe
is accompliſhed, like a fiend, it leaves us
to the torture of thoſe feelings, which its
power had ſuſpended—not annihilated,—to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0247300304:364"/>
the tortures of compaſſion, remorſe, and
conſcience. Then, we awaken as from a
dream, and perceive a new world around us—we
gaze in aſtoniſhment, and horror—but
the deed is committed; not all the powers
of heaven and earth united can undo it—and
the ſpectres of conſcience will not fly!
What are riches—grandeur—health itſelf,
to the luxury of a pure conſcience, the
health of the ſoul;—and what the ſufferings
of poverty, diſappointment, deſpair—to
the anguiſh of an afflicted one! O! how
long is it ſince I knew that luxury! I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that I had ſuffered the moſt agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pangs of human nature, in love, jealouſy
and deſpair—but theſe pangs were eaſe,
compared with the ſtings of conſcience,
which I have ſince endured. I taſted too
what was called the ſweet of revenge—but it
was tranſient, it expired even with the object,
that provoked it. Remember, ſiſter, that the
paſſions are the ſeeds of vices as well as of
virtues, from which either may ſpring, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0247300304:365"/>
as they are nurtured. Unhappy
they who have never been taught the art to
govern them"</p>
            <p>"Alas! unhappy!" ſaid the abbeſs,
"and ill-informed of our holy religion!"
Emily liſtened to Agnes, in ſilent awe,
while ſhe ſtill examined the miniature, and
became confirmed in her opinion of its
ſtrong reſemblance to the portrait at Udol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho.
"This face is familiar to me" ſaid
ſhe, wiſhing to lead the nun to an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet fearing to diſcover too abruptly
her knowledge of Udolpho.</p>
            <p>"You are miſtaken" replied Agnes,
"you certainly never ſaw that picture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore."</p>
            <p>"No," replied Emily, "but I have ſeen
one extremely like it" "Impoſſible," said
Agnes, who may now be called the Lady
Laurentini.</p>
            <p>"It was in the caſtle of Udolpho" con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Emily, looking ſtedfaſtly at her.</p>
            <p>"Of Udolpho!" exclaimed Laurentini,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0247300304:366"/>
"of Udolpho in Italy!" "The ſame," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Emily.</p>
            <p>"You know me then," ſaid Laurentini,
"and you are the daughter of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs"
Emily was ſomewhat ſurpriſed at
this abrupt aſſertion. "I am the daughter
of the late Monſ. St. Aubert," ſaid ſhe;
"and the lady you name is an utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to me."</p>
            <p>"At leaſt you believe ſo," rejoined Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentini.</p>
            <p>Emily aſked what reaſons there could be
to believe otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>"The family likeneſs, that yon bear her,"
ſaid the nun. "The Marchioneſs, it is
known, was attached to a gentleman of
Gaſcony, at the time when ſhe accepted the
hand of the Marquis, by the command of
her father. Ill-fated, unhappy woman!"</p>
            <p>Emily, remembering the extreme emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which St. Aubert had betrayed on the
mention of the Marchioneſs, would now
have ſuffered ſomething more than ſurpriſe,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0247300304:367"/>
had her confidence in his integrity been
leſs; as it was, ſhe could not, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
believe what the words of Laurentini
inſinuated; yet ſhe ſtill felt ſtrongly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted,
concerning them, and begged, that
ſhe would explain them further.</p>
            <p>"Do not urge me on that ſubject" ſaid
the nun, "it is to me a terrible one! Would
that I could blot it from my memory!"
She ſighed deeply, and, after the pauſe of a
moment, aſked Emily, by what means ſhe
had diſcovered her name?</p>
            <p>"By your portrait in the caſtle of Udol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,
to which this miniature bears a ſtriking
reſemblance" replied Emily.</p>
            <p>"You have been at Udolpho then!"
ſaid the nun, with great emotion. "Alas!
what ſcenes does the mention of it revive in
my fancy—ſcenes of happineſs—of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—and
of horror!"</p>
            <p>At this moment, the terrible ſpectacle,
which Emily had witneſſed in a chamber of
that caſftle, occurred to her, and ſhe ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
while ſhe looked upon the nun—
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0247300304:368"/>
and recollected her late words—that "years
of prayer and penitence could not waſh out
the foulneſs of murder." She was now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to attribute theſe to another cauſe,
than that of delirium. With a degree of
horror, that almoſt deprived her of ſenſe,
ſhe now believed ſhe looked upon a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer;
all the recollected behaviour of
Laurentini ſeemed to confirm the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet Emily was ſtill loſt in a labyrinth
of perplexities, and, not knowing how to
aſk the queſtions, which might lead to
truth, ſhe could only hint them in broken
ſentences.</p>
            <p>"Your ſudden departure from Udolpho"—ſaid
ſhe.</p>
            <p>Laurentini groaned.</p>
            <p>"The reports that followed it," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Emily—"The weſt chamber—the
mourning veil—the object it conceals!—when
murders are committed—"</p>
            <p>The nun ſhrieked, "What! there
again!" ſaid ſhe, endeavouring to raiſe
herſelf, while her ſtarting eyes ſeemed to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0247300304:369"/>
follow ſome object round the room—"Come
from the grave! What! Blood—blood
too!—There was no blood—thou
canſt not ſay it!—Nay, do not ſmile,—do
not ſmile ſo piteouſly!"</p>
            <p>Laurentini fell into convulſions, as ſhe
uttered the laſt words; and Emily, unable
any longer to endure the horror of the
ſcene, hurried from the room, and ſent ſome
nuns to the aſſiſtance of the abbeſs.</p>
            <p>The Lady Blanche, and the boarders, who
were in the parlour, now aſſembled round
Emily, and, alarmed by her manner and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
countenance, aſked a hundred queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which ſhe avoided anſwering further,
than by ſaying, that ſhe believed ſiſter Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
was dying. They received this as a
ſufficient explanation of her terror, and had
then leiſure to offer reſtoratives, which, at
length, ſomewhat revived Emily, whoſe
mind was, however, ſo much ſhocked with
terrible ſur miſes, and perplexed with doubts
by ſome words from the nun, that ſhe was
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0247300304:370"/>
unable to converſe, and would have left the
convent immediately, had ſhe not wiſhed to
know whether Laurentini would ſurvive the
late attack. After waiting ſome time, ſhe
was informed, that, the convulſions having
ceaſed, Laurentini ſeemed to be reviving,
and Emily and Blanche were departing,
when the abbeſs appeared, who, drawing
the former aſide, ſaid ſhe had ſomething
of conſequence to ſay to her, but, as it
was late, ſhe would not detain her then, and
requeſted to ſee her on the following day.</p>
            <p>Emily promiſed to viſit her, and, having
taken leave, returned with the Lady Blanche
towards the chateau, on the way to which
the deep gloom of the woods made Blanche
lament, that the evening was ſo far advanced;
for the ſurrounding ſtillneſs and obſcurity
rendered her ſenſible of fear, though there
was a ſervant to protect her; while Emily was
too much engaged by the horrors of the
ſcene ſhe had juſt witneſſed, to be affected
by the ſolemnity of the ſhades, otherwiſe
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0247300304:371"/>
than as they ſerved to promote her gloomy
reverie, from which, however, ſhe was at
length recalled by the Lady Blanche, who
pointed out, at ſome diſtance, in the duſky
path they were winding, two perſons ſlowly
advancing. It was impoſſible to avoid them
without ſtriking into a ſtill more ſecluded
part of the wood, whither the ſtrangers
might eaſily follow; but all apprehenſion
vaniſhed, when Emily diſtinguiſhed the
voice of Monſ. Du Pont, and perceived,
that his companion was the gentleman,
whom ſhe had ſeen at the monaſtery, and
who was now converſing with ſo much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
as not immediately to perceive
their approach. When Du Pont joined
the ladies, the ſtranger took leave, and they
proceeded to the chateau, where the Count,
when he heard of Monſ. Bonnac, claimed
him for an acquaintance, and, on learning
the melancholy occaſion of his viſit to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,
and that he was lodged at a ſmall
inn in the village, begged the favour of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0247300304:372"/>
Monſ. Du Pont to invite him to the
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau.</p>
            <p>The latter was happy to do ſo, and the
ſcruples of reſerve, which made M. Bonnac
heſitate to accept the invitation, being at
length overcome, they went to the chateau,
where the kindneſs of the Count and the
ſprightlineſs of his ſon were exerted to
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the gloom, that overhung the ſpirits
of the ſtranger. M. Bonnac was an officer
in the French ſervice, and appeared to be
about fifty; his figure was tall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
his manners had received the laſt
poliſh, and there was ſomething in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
uncommonly intereſting; for over
features, which, in youth, muſt have been
remarkably handſome, was ſpread a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
that ſeemed the effect of long miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
rather than of conſtitution, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>The converſation he held, during ſupper,
was evidently an effort of politeneſs, and
there were intervals in which, unable to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0247300304:373"/>
ſtruggle againſt the feelings, that depreſſed
him, he relapſed into ſilence and abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from which, however, the Count,
ſometimes, withdrew him in a manner
ſo delicate and benevolent, that Emily,
while ſhe obſerved him, almoſt fancied ſhe
beheld her late father.</p>
            <p>The party ſeparated, at an early hour,
and then, in the ſolitude of her apartment,
the ſcenes, which Emily had lately wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed,
returned to her fancy, with dreadful
energy. That in the dying nun ſhe ſhould
have diſcovered Signora Laurentini, who,
inſtead of having been murdered by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni,
was, as it now ſeemed, herſelf guilty
of ſome dreadful crime, excited both horror
and ſurpriſe in a high degree; nor did the
hints, which ſhe had dropped, reſpecting
the marriage of the Marchioneſs de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroi,
and the enquiries ſhe had made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Emily's birth, occaſion her a leſs
degree of intereſt, though it was of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory, which ſiſter Frances had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0247300304:374"/>
related, and had ſaid to be that of
Agnes, it now appeared, was erroneous; but
for what purpoſe it had been fabricated,
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the more effectually to conceal the true
ſtory, Emily could not even gueſs. Above
all, her intereſt was excited as to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the ſtory of the late Marchioneſs
de Villeroi bore to that of her father; for,
that ſome kind of relation exiſted between
them, the grief of St. Aubert, upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her named, his requeſt to be buried
near her, and her picture, which had been
ſound among his papers, certainly proved.
Sometimes it occurred to Emily, that he
might have been the lover, to whom it was
ſaid the Marchioneſs was attached, when ſhe
was compelled to marry the Marquis de
Villeroi; but that he had afterwards Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
a paſſion for her, ſhe could not ſuffer
herſelf to believe, for a moment. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which he had ſo ſolemnly enjoined
her to deſtroy, ſhe now fancied had related
to this connection, and ſhe wiſhed more
earneſtly than before to know the reaſons,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0247300304:375"/>
that made him conſider the injunction neceſſary,
which, had her faith in his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
been leſs, would have led to believe,
that there was a myſtery in her birth diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to her parents, which thoſe manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
might have revealed.</p>
            <p>Reflections, ſimilar to theſe, engaged her
mind, during the greater part of the night,
and when, at length, ſhe fell into a ſlumber,
it was only to behold a viſion of the dying
nun, and to awaken in horrors, like thoſe
ſhe had witneſſed.</p>
            <p>On the following morning, ſhe was too
much indiſpoſed to attend her appointment
with the abbeſs, and, before the day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
ſhe heard, that ſiſter Agnes was no
more. Monſ. Bonnac received this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
with concern; but Emily obſerved,
that he did not appear ſo much affected
now, as on the preceding evening, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after quitting the apartment of the
nun, whoſe death was probably leſs terrible
to him, than the confeſſion he had been
then called upon to witneſs. However this
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0247300304:376"/>
might be, he was perhaps conſoled, in ſome
degree, by a knowledge of the legacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
him, ſince his family was large,
and the extravagance of ſome part of it
had lately been the means of involving
him in great diſtreſs, and even in the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of a priſon; and it was the grief he
had ſuffered from the wild career of a
favourite ſon, with the pecuniary anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and misfortunes conſequent upon it,
that had given to his countenance the air
of dejection, which had ſo much intereſted
Emily.</p>
            <p>To his friend Monſ. Du Pont he recited
ſome particulars of his late ſufferings, when
it appeared, that he had been conſined for
ſeveral months in one of the priſons of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
with little hope of releaſe, and without
the comfort of ſeeing his wife, who had
been abſent in the country, endeavouring,
though in vain, to procure aſſiſtance from
his friends. When, at length, ſhe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
an order for admittance, ſhe was ſo
much ſhocked at the change, which long
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0247300304:377"/>
conſinement and ſorrow had made in his
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
that ſhe was ſeized with ſits,
which, by their long continuance, threatened
her life.</p>
            <p>"Our ſituation affected thoſe, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to witneſs it," continued Monſ. Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,
"and one generous friend, who was
in conſinement at the ſame time, afterwards
employed the firſt moments of his liberty
in efforts to obtain mine. He ſucceeded;
the heavy debt, that oppreſſed me, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged;
and, when I would have expreſſed
my ſenſe of the obligation I had received,
my benefactor was fled from my ſearch. I
have reaſon to believe he was the victim of
his own generoſity, and that he returned to
the ſtate of conſinement, from which he had
releaſed me; but every enquiry after him
was unſucceſsful. Amiable and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Valancourt!"</p>
            <p>"Valancourt!" exclaimed Monſ. Du
Pont. "Of what family?"</p>
            <p>"The Valancourts, Counts Duvarney," replied Monſ. Bonnac.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0247300304:378"/>
The emotion of Monſ. Du Pont, when
he diſcovered the generous benefactor of
his friend to be the rival of his love, can
only be imagined; but, having overcome
his firſt ſurpriſe, he diſſipated the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of Monſ. Bonnac by acquainting
him, that Valancourt was at liberty, and
had lately been in Languedoc; after which
his affection for Emily prompted him to
make ſome enquiries, reſpecting the conduct
of his rival, during his ſtay at Paris, of
which M. Bonnac appeared to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
The anſwers he received were
ſuch as convinced him, that Valancourt
had been much miſrepreſented, and, painful
as was the ſacrifice, he formed the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of relinquiſhing his purſuit of Emily
to a lover, who, it now appeared, was not
unworthy of the regard, with which ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
him.</p>
            <p>The converſation of Monſ. Bonnac diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that Valancourt, ſome time after
his arrival at Paris, had been drawn into
the ſnares, which determined vice had ſpread
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0247300304:379"/>
for him, and that his hours had been chiefly
divided between the parties of the captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Marchioneſs and thoſe gaming aſſemblies,
to which the envy, or the avarice, of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
officers had ſpared no art to ſeduce him.
In theſe parties he had loſt large ſums, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to recover ſmall ones, and to ſuch loſſes
the Count De Villefort and Monſ. Henri
had been frequent witneſſes. His reſources
were, at length, exhauſted; and the Count,
his brother, exaſperated by his conduct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to continue the ſupplies neceſſary to
his preſent mode of life, when Valancourt,
in conſequence of accumulated debts, was
thrown into conſinement, where his brother
ſuffered him to remain, in the hope, that
puniſhment might effect a reform of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
which had not yet been confirmed by
long habit.</p>
            <p>In the ſolitude of his priſon, Valancourt
had leiſure for reflection, and cauſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
here, too, the image of Emily,
which, amidſt the diſſipation of the city
had been obſcured, but never obliterated
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0247300304:380"/>
from his heart, revived with all the charms
of innocence and beauty, to reproach him
for having ſacrificed his happineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed
his talents by purſuits, which his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
faculties would formerly have taught
him to conſider were as taſteleſs as they
were degrading. But, though his paſſions
had been ſeduced, his heart was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
nor had habit riveted the chains,
that hung heavily on his conſcience; and,
as he retained that energy of will, which
was neceſſary to burſt them, he, at length,
emancipated himſelf from the bondage of
vice, but not till after much effort and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Being releaſed by his brother from the
priſon, where he had witneſſed the affecting
meeting between Monſ. Bonnac and his
wife, with whom he had been for ſome time
acquainted, the firſt uſe of his liberty formed
a ſtriking inſtance of his humanity and his
raſhneſs; for with nearly all the money,
juſt received from his brother, he went to a
gaming-houſe, and gave it as a laſt ſtake
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0247300304:381"/>
for the chance of reſtoring his friend to
freedom, and to his afflicted family. The
event was fortunate, and, while he had
awaited the iſſue of this momentous ſtake,
he made a ſolemn vow never again to yield
to the deſtructive and faſcinating vice of
gaming.</p>
            <p>Having reſtored the venerable Monſ.
Bonnac to his rejoicing family, he hurried
from Paris to Eſtuviere; and, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of having made the wretched happy,
forgot, for a while, his own misfortunes.
Soon, however, he remembered, that he had
thrown away the fortune, without which he
could never hope to marry Emily; and life,
unleſs paſſed with her, now ſcarcely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſupportable; for her goodneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinement,
and ſimplicity of heart, rendered
her beauty more enchanting, if poſſible, to
his fancy, than it had ever yet appeared.
Experience had taught him to underſtand
the full value of the qualities, which he
had before admired, but which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trasted
characters he had ſeen in the world
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0247300304:382"/>
made him now adore; and theſe reflections,
increaſing the pangs of remorſe and regret,
occaſioned the deep dejection, that had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him even into the preſence of
Emily, of whom he conſidered himſelf no
longer worthy. To the ignominy of having
received pecuniary obligations from the
Marchioneſs Chamfort, or any other lady of
intrigue, as the Count De Villefort had been
informed, or of having been engaged in the
depredating ſchemes of gameſters, Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
had never ſubmitted; and theſe were
ſome of ſuch ſcandals as often mingle
with truth, againſt the unfortunate. Count
De Villefort had received them from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which he had no reaſon to doubt,
and which the imprudent conduct he had
himſelf witneſſed in Valancourt, had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
induced him the more readily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
Being ſuch as Emily could not
name to the Chevalier, he had no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of refuting them; and, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
himſelf to be unworthy of her eſteem,
he little ſuſpected, that he was confirming
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0247300304:383"/>
to her the moſt dreadful calumnies. Thus
the miſtake had been mutual, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſo, when Monſ. Bonnac explained
the conduct of his generous, but impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
young friend to Du Pont, who, with
ſevere juſtice, determined not only to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Count on this ſubject, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
all hope of Emily. Such a ſacrifice as
his love rendered this, was deſerving of a
noble reward, and Monſ. Bonnac, if it had
been poſſible for him to forget the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Valancourt, would have wiſhed that
Emily might accept the juſt Du Pont.</p>
            <p>When the Count was informed of the
error he had committed, he was extremely
ſhocked at the conſequence of his credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the account which Monſ. Bonnac
gave of his friend's ſituation, while at Paris,
convinced him, that Valancourt had been
entrapped by the ſchemes of a ſet of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
young men, with whom his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had partly obliged him to aſſociate,
rather than by an inclination to vice; and,
charmed by the humanity, and noble, though
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0247300304:384"/>
raſh generoſity, which his conduct towards
Monſ. Bonnac exhibited, he forgave him
the tranſient errors, that had ſtained his
youth, and reſtored him to the high degree
of eſteem, with which he had regarded him,
during their early acquaintance. But, as
the leaſt reparation he could now make Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
was to afford him an opportunity
of explaining to Emily his former conduct,
he immediately wrote, to requeſt his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of the unintentional injury he had
done him, and to invite him to Chateau-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Blanc.
Motives of delicacy with-held the
Count from informing Emily of this letter,
and of kindneſs from acquainting her with
the diſcovery reſpecting Valancourt, till his
arrival ſhould ſave her from the poſſibility
of anxiety, as to its event; and this precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſpared her even ſeverer inquietude, than
the Count had foreſeen, ſince he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the ſymptoms of deſpair, which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt's
late conduct had betrayed.</p>

            <p>SOME circumſtances of an extraordinary
nature now withdrew Emily from her own
ſorrows, and excited emotions, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
of both ſurpriſe and horror.</p>
            <p>A few days following that, on which
Signora Laurentini died, her will was opened
at the monaſtery, in the preſence of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
and Monſ. Bonnac, when it was
found, that one third of her perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
was bequeathed to the neareſt ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relative of the late Marchioneſs de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroi,
and that Emily was the perſon.</p>
            <p>With the ſecret of Emily's family the
abbeſs had long been acquainted, and it was
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0247300304:386"/>
in obſervance of the earneſt requeſt of St.
Aubert, who was known to the friar, that
attended him on his death bed, that his
daughter had remained in ignorance of her
relationſhip to the Marchioneſs. But ſome
hints, which had fallen from Signora Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentini,
during her laſt interview with Emily,
and a confeſſion of a very extraordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
given in her dying hours, had made
the abbeſs think it neceſſary to converſe
with her young friend, on the topic ſhe had
not before ventured to introduce; and it
was for this purpoſe, that ſhe had requeſted
to ſee her on the morning that followed
her interview with the nun. Emily's indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
had then prevented the intended
converſation; but now, after the will had
been examined, ſhe received a ſummons,
which ſhe immediately obeyed, and became
informed of circumſtances, that powerfully
affected her. As the narrative of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs
was, however, deficient in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
of which the reader may wiſh to be
informed, and the hiſtory of the nun is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0247300304:387"/>
connected with the fate of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
de Villeroi, we ſhall omit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
that paſſed in the parlour of the
convent, and mingle with our relation a
brief hiſtory of</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>LAURENTINI DI UDOLPHO,</head>
               <p>Who was the only child of her parents,
and heireſs of the ancient houſe of Udol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,
in the territory of Venice. It was the
firſt misfortune of her life, and that which
led to all her ſucceeding miſery, that the
friends, who ought to have reſtrained her
ſtrong paſſions, and mildly inſtructed her
in the art of governing them, nurtured
them by early indulgence. But they che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
their own failings in her; for their
conduct was not the reſult of rational kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and, when they either indulged, or
oppoſed the paſſions of their child, they
gratified their own. Thus they indulged
her with weakenſs, and reprehended her
with violence; her ſpirit was exaſperated
by their vehemence, inſtead of being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0247300304:388"/>
by their wiſdom; and their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
became conteſts for victory, in
which the due tenderneſs of the parents,
and the affectionate duties of the child,
were equally forgotten; but, as returning
fondneſs diſarmed the parents' reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſooneſt, Laurentini was ſuffered to
believe that ſhe had conquered, and her
paſſions became ſtronger by every effort,
that had been, employed to ſubdue them.</p>
               <p>The death of her father and mother in
the ſame year left her to her own diſcretion,
under the dangerous circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
on youth and beauty. She was fond
of company, delighted with admiration, yet
diſdainful of the opinion of the world,
when it happened to contradict her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
had a gay and brilliant wit, and
was miſtreſs of all the arts of faſcination.
Her conduct was ſuch as might have been
expected, from the weakenſs of her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and the ſtrength of her paſſions.</p>
               <p>Among her numerous admirers was the
late Marquis de Villeroi, who, on his tour
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0247300304:389"/>
through Italy, ſaw Laurentini at Venice,
where ſhe uſually reſided, and became her
paſſionate adorer. Equally captivated by
the figure and accompliſhments of the
Marquis, who was at that period one of
the moſt diſtinguiſhed noblemen of the
French court, ſhe had the art ſo effectually
to conceal from him the dangerous traits
of her character and the blemiſhes of her
late conduct, that he ſolicited her hand in
marriage.</p>
               <p>Before the nuptials were concluded, ſhe
retired to the caſtle of Udolpho, whither
the Marquis followed, and, where her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
relaxing from the propriety, which
ſhe had lately aſſumed, diſcovered to him the
precipice, on which he ſtood. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuter
enquiry than he had before thought
it neceſſary to make, convinced him, that
he had been deceived in her character, and
ſhe, whom he had deſigned for his wife, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
became his miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed ſome weeks at Udol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,
he was called abruptly to France,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0247300304:390"/>
whither he returned with extreme reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for his heart was ſtill faſcinated by
the arts of Laurentini, with whom, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he had on various pretences delayed
his marriage; but, to reconcile her to this
ſeparation, he now gave repeated promiſes
of returning to conclude the nuptials, as
ſoon as the affair, which thus ſuddenly
called him to France, ſhould permit.</p>
               <p>Soothed, in ſome degree, by theſe aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
ſhe ſuffered him to depart; and,
ſoon after, her relative, Montoni, arriving
at Udolpho, renewed the addreſſes, which
ſhe had before refuſed, and which ſhe now
again rejected. Meanwhile, her thoughts
were conſtantly with the Marquis de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roi,
for whom ſhe ſuffered all the delirium
of Italian love, cheriſhed by the ſolitude, to
which ſhe conſined herſelf; for ſhe had now
loſt all taſte for the pleaſures of ſociety
and the gaiety of amuſement. Her only
indulgences were to ſigh and weep over a
miniature of the Marquis; to viſit the
ſcenes, that had witneſſed their happineſs,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0247300304:391"/>
to pour forth her heart to him in writing,
and to count the weeks, the days, which
muſt intervene before the period that he
had mentioned as probable for his return.
But this period paſſed without bringing him;
and week after week followed in heavy and
almoſt intolerable expectation. During this
interval, Laurentini's fancy, occupied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly
by one idea, became diſordered;
and, her whole heart being devoted to one
object, life became hateful to her, when
ſhe believed that object loſt.</p>
               <p>Several months paſſed, during which ſhe
heard nothing from the Marquis de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roi,
and her days were marked, at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
with the phrenſy of paſſion and the
fullenneſs of deſpair. She ſecluded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from all viſitors, and, ſometimes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in her apartment, for weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
refuſing to ſpeak to every perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
her favourite female attendant, writing
ſcraps of letters, reading, again and again,
thoſe ſhe had received from the Marquis,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0247300304:392"/>
weeping over his picture, and ſpeaking to
it, for many hours, upbraiding, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and careſſing it alternately.</p>
               <p>At length, a report reached her, that
the Marquis had married in France, and,
after ſuffering all the extremes of love, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
and indignation, ſhe formed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
reſolution of going ſecretly to that
country, and, if the report proved true, of
attempting a deep revenge. To her favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite
woman only ſhe conſided the plan of
her journey, and ſhe engaged her to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of it. Having collected her jewels,
which, deſcending to her from many
branches of her family, were of immenſe
value, and all her caſh, to a very large
amount, they were packed in a trunk,
which was privately conveyed to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
town, whither Laurentini, with
this only ſervant, followed, and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſecretly to Leghorn, where they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oarked
for France.</p>
               <p>When, on her arrival in Languedoc, ſhe
found, that the Marquis de Villeroi had
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0247300304:393"/>
been married, for ſome months, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
almoſt deprived her of reaſon, and ſhe
alternately projected and abandoned the
horrible deſign of murdering the Marquis,
his wife and herſelf. At length ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to throw herſelf in his way, with
an intention of reproaching him, for his
conduct, and of ſtabbing herſelf in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
but, when ſhe again ſaw him, who
ſo long had been the conſtant object of her
thoughts and affections, reſentment yielded
to love; her reſolution failed; ſhe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the conflict of emotions, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed
her heart, and fainted away.</p>
               <p>The Marquis was not proof againſt her
beauty and ſenſibility; all the energy,
with which he had firſt loved, returned,
for his paſſion had been reſiſted by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
rather than overcome by indifference;
and, ſince the honour of his family would
not permit him to marry her, he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to ſubdue his love, and had ſo far
ſucceeded, as to ſelect the then Marchioneſs
for his wife, whom he loved at firſt with a
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0247300304:394"/>
tempered and rational affection. But the
mild virtues of that amiable lady did not
recompenſe him for her indifference, which
appeared, notwithſtanding her efforts to
conceal it; and he had, for ſome time, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that her affections were engaged by
another perſon, when Laurentini arrived in
Languedoc. This artful Italian ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that ſhe had regained her influence
over him, and, ſoothed by the diſcovery,
ſhe determined to live, and to employ all
her enchantments to win his conſent to the
diabolical deed, which ſhe believed was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the ſecurity of her happineſs.
She conducted her ſcheme with deep disſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
and patient perſeverance, and,
having completely eſtranged the affections
of the Marquis from his wife, whoſe gentle
goodneſs and unimpaſſioned manners had
ceaſed to pleaſe, when contraſted with the
captivations of the Italian, ſhe proceeded
to awaken in his mind the jealouſy of pride,
for it was no longer that of love, and even
pointed out to him the perſon, to whom
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0247300304:395"/>
ſhe affirmed the Marchioneſs had ſacrificed
her honour; but Laurentini had firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from him a ſolemn promiſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
avenging himſelf upon his rival. This
was an important part of her plan, for ſhe
knew, that, if his deſire of vengeance was
reſtrained towards one party, it would burn
more fiercely towards the other, and he
might then, perhaps, be prevailed on to
aſſiſt in the horrible act, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
him from the only barrier, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him from making her his wife.</p>
               <p>The innocent Marchioneſs, meanwhile,
obſerved, with extreme grief, the alteration
in her huſband's manners. He became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and thoughful in her preſence; his
conduct was auſtere, and ſometimes even
rude; and he left her, for many hours
together, to weep for his unkindneſs; and
to form plans for the recovery of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
His conduct afflicted her the more,
becauſe, in obedience to the command of
her father, ſhe had accepted his hand,
though her affections were engaged to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe amiable diſpoſition, ſhe had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0247300304:396"/>
to believe, would have enſured her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
This circumſtance Laurentini had
diſcovered, ſoon after her arrival in France,
and had made ample uſe of it in aſſiſting
her deſigns upon the Marquis, to whom ſhe
adduced ſuch ſeeming proof of his wife's
infidelity, that, in the frantic rage of
wounded honour, he conſented to deſtroy
his wife. A ſlow poiſon was adminiſtered,
and ſhe fell a victim to the jealouſy and
ſubtlety of Laurentini and to the guilty
weakneſs of her huſband.</p>
               <p>But the moment of Laurentini's triumph,
the moment, to which ſhe had looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for the completion of all her wiſhes,
proved only the commencement of a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that never left her to her dying hour.</p>
               <p>The paſſion of revenge, which had in part
ſtimulated her to the commiſſion of this
atrocious deed, died, even at the moment
when it was gratified, and left her to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of unavailing pity and remorſe, which
would probably have empoiſoned all the
years ſhe had promiſed herſelf with the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0247300304:397"/>
Marquis de Villeroi, had her expectations
of an alliance with him been realized. But
he, too, had found the moment of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
to be that of remorſe, as to himſelf,
and deteſtation, as to the partner of his
crime; the feeling, which he had miſtaken
for conviction, was no more; and he ſtood
aſtoniſhed, and aghaſt, that no proof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
of his wife's infidelity, now that ſhe
had ſuffered the puniſhment of guilt. Even
when he was informed, that ſhe was dying,
he had felt ſuddenly and unaccountably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured
of her innocence, nor was the ſolemn
aſſurance ſhe made him in her laſt hour, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of affording him a ſtronger conviction
of her blameleſs conduct.</p>
               <p>In the firſt horrors of remorſe and deſpair,
he felt inclined to deliver up himſelf and
the woman, who had plunged him into this
abyſs of guilt, into the hands of juſtice; but,
when the paroxyſm of his ſuffering was
over, his intention changed. Laurentini,
however, he ſaw only once afterwards, and
that was, to curſe her as the inſtigator of his
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0247300304:398"/>
crime, and to ſay, that he ſpared her life
only on condition, that ſhe paſſed the reſt
of her days in prayer and penance. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with, diſappointment, on receiving
contempt and abhorrence from the man, for
whoſe ſake ſhe had not ſcrupled to ſtain her
conſcience with human blood, and, touched
with horror of the unavailing crime ſhe had
committed, ſhe renounced the world, and
retired to the monaſtery of St. Claire, a
dreadful victim to unreſiſted paſſion.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, immediately after the death
of his wife, quitted Chateau-le-Blanc, to
which he never returned, and endeavoured
to loſe the ſenſe of his crime amidſt the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
of war, or the diſſipations of a capital;
but his efforts were vain; a deep dejection
hung over him ever after, for which his
moſt intimate friends could not account,
and he, at length, died, with a degree of
horror nearly equal to that, which Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini
had ſuffered. The phyſician, who had
obſerved the ſingular appearance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Marchioneſs, after death, had been
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0247300304:399"/>
bribed to ſilence; and, as the ſurmiſes of a
few of the ſervants had proceeded no further
than a whiſper, the affair had never been
inveſtigated. Whether this whiſper ever
reached the father of the Marchioneſs, and,
if it did, whether the difficulty of obtaining
proof deterred him from proſecuting the
Marquis de Villeroi, is uncertain; but her
death was deeply lamented by ſome part of
her family, and particularly by her brother,
M. St. Aubert; for that was the degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationſhip,
which had exiſted between Emily's
father and the Marchioneſs; and there is no
doubt, that he ſuſpected the manner of her
death. Many letters paſſed between the
Marquis and him, ſoon after the deceaſe
of this beloved ſiſter, the ſubject of which
was not known, but there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that they related to the cauſe of her
death; and theſe were the papers, together
with ſome letters of the Marchioneſs, who
had conſided to her brother the occaſion of
her unhappineſs, which St. Aubert had ſo
ſolemnly enjoined his daughter to deſtroy:
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0247300304:400"/>
and anxiety for her peace had probably made
him forbid her to enquire into the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
ſtory, to which they alluded. Such,
indeed, had been his affliction, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature
death of this his favourite ſiſter,
whoſe unhappy marriage had from the firſt
excited his tendereſt pity, that he never
could hear her named, or mention her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
after her death, except to Madame St.
Aubert. From Emily, whoſe ſenſibility he
feared to awaken, he had ſo carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
her hiſtory and name, that ſhe was
ignorant, till now, that ſhe ever had ſuch a
relative as the Marchioneſs de Villeroi; and
from this motive he had enjoined ſilence to
his only ſurviving ſiſter, Madame Cheron,
who had ſcrupulouſly obſerved his requeſt.</p>
               <p>It was over ſome of the laſt pathetic let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Marchioneſs, that St. Aubert was
weeping, when he was obſerved by Emily,
on the eye of her departure from La Vallée,
and it was her picture, which he had ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
careſſed. Her diſaſtrous death may
account for the emotion he had betrayed, on
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0247300304:401"/>
hearing her named by La Voiſin, and for
his requeſt to be interred near the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Villerois, where her remains
were depoſited, but not thoſe of her huſband,
who was buried, where he died, in the north
of France.</p>
               <p>The confeſſor, who attended St. Aubert
in his laſt moments, recollected him to be
the brother of the late Marchioneſs, when
St. Aubert, from tenderneſs to Emily, had
conjured him to conceal the circumſtance,
and to requeſt that the abbeſs, to whoſe care
he particularly recommended her, would do
the ſame; a requeſt, which had been exactly
obſerved.</p>
               <p>Laurentini, on her arrival in France, had
carefully concealed her name and family,
and, the better to diſguiſe her real hiſtory,
had, on entering the convent, cauſed the
ſtory to be circulated, which had impoſed,
on ſiſter Frances, and it is probable, that the
abbeſs, who did not preſide in the convent,
at the time of her noviciation, was alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ignorant of the truth. The deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0247300304:402"/>
that ſeized on the mind of Laurentini,
together with the ſufferings of diſappointed
paſſion, for ſhe ſtill loved the Marquis, again
unſettled her intellects, and, after the firſt
paroxyſms of deſpair were paſſed, a heavy
and ſilent melancholy, had ſettled upon her
ſpirits, which ſuffered few interruptions from
fits of phrenſy, till the time of her death.
During many years, it had been her only
amuſement to walk in the woods near the
monaſtery, in the ſolitary hours of night,
and to play upon a favourite inſtrument, to
which ſhe ſometimes joined. the delightful
melody of her voice, in the moſt ſolemn and
melancholy airs of her native country, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulated
by all the energetic feeling, that
dwelt in her heart. The phyſician, who had
attended her, recommended it to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to indulge her in this whim, as the only
means of ſoothing her diſtempered fancy;
and ſhe was ſuffered to walk in the lonely
hours of night, attended by the ſervant, who
had accompanied her from Italy; but, as
the indulgence tranſgreſſed againſt the rules
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0247300304:403"/>
of the convent, it was kept as ſecret as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
and thus the myſterious muſic of
Laurentini had combined with other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
to produce a report, that not
only the chateau, but its neighbourhood,
was haunted.</p>
               <p>Soon after her entrance into this holy
community, and before ſhe had ſhewn any
ſymptoms of inſanity there, ſhe made a will,
in which, after bequeathing a conſiderable
legacy to the convent, ſhe divided the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of her perſonal property, which
her jewels made very valuable, between the
wife of Monſ. Bonnac, who was an Italian
lady and her relation, and the neareſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
relative of the late Marchioneſs de
Villeroi. As Emily St. Aubert was not
only the neareſt, but the ſole relative, this
legacy deſcended to her, and thus explained
to her the whole myſtery of her father's
conduct.</p>
               <p>The reſemblance between Emily and her
unfortunate aunt had frequently been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by Laurentini, and had occaſioned
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0247300304:404"/>
the ſingular behaviour, which had formerly
alarmed her; but it was in the nun's dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hour, when her conſcience gave her
perpetually the idea of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that ſhe became more ſenſible, than
ever, of this likeneſs, and, in her phrenſy,
deemed it no reſemblance of the perſon ſhe
had injured, but the original herſelf. The
bold aſſertion, that had followed, on the
recovery of her ſenſes, that Emily was the
daughter of the Marchioneſs de Villeroi,
aroſe from a ſuſpicion that ſhe was ſo;
for, knowing that her rival, when ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Marquis, was attached to another
lover, ſhe had ſcarcely ſcrupled to believe,
that her honour had been ſacrificed, like
her own, to an unreſiſted paſſion.</p>
               <p>Of a crime, however, to which Emily
had ſuſpected, from her phrenſied confeſſion
of murder, that ſhe had been inſtrumental
in the caſtle of Udolpho, Laurentini was
innocent; and ſhe had herſelf been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
concerning the ſpectacle, that formerly
occaſioned her ſo much terror, arid had
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0247300304:405"/>
ſince compelled her, for a while, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the horrors of the nun to a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a murder, committed in that caſtle.</p>
               <p>It may be remembered, that, in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Udolpho, hung a black veil, whoſe
ſingular ſituation had excited Emily's curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and which afterwards diſcloſed an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that had overwhelmed her with horror;
for, on lifting it, there appeared, inſtead of
the picture ſhe had expected, within a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the wall, a human figure of ghaſtly
paleneſs, ſtretched at its length, and dreſſed
in the habiliments of the grave. What added
to the horror of the ſpectacle, was, that the
face appeared partly decayed and disfigured
by worms, which were viſible. on the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and hands. On ſuch an object, it will
be readily believed, that no perſon could
endure to look twice. Emily, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected,
had, after the firſt glance, let the
veil drop, and her terror had prevented her
from ever after provoking a renewal of ſuch
ſuffering, as ſhe had then experienced.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0247300304:406"/>
Had ſhe dared to look again, her deluſion
and her fears would have vaniſhed together,
and ſhe would have perceived, that the figure
before her was not human, but formed of wax.
The hiſtory of it is ſomewhat extraordinary,
though not without example in the records
of that fierce ſeverity, which monkiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
has ſometimes inflicted on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
A member of the houſe of Udolpho,
having committed ſome offence againſt the
prerogative of the church, had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to the penance of contemplating,
during certain hours of the day, a waxen
image, made to reſemble a human body in
the ſtate, to which it is reduced after death.
This penance, ſerving as a memento of the
condition at which he muſt himſelf arrive,
had been deſigned to reprove the pride of
the Marquis of Udolpho, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſo much exaſperated that of the
Romiſh church; and he had not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly
obſerved this penance himſelf,
which, he had believed, was to obtain a
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0247300304:407"/>
pardon for all his ſins, but had made it a
condition in his will, that his deſcendants
ſhould preſerve the image, on pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
to the church a certain part of his
domain, that they alſo might profit by the
humiliating moral it conveyed. The figure,
therefore, had been ſuffered to retain its
ſtation in the wall of the chamber, but his
deſcendants excuſed themſelves from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the penance, to which he had been
enjoined.</p>
               <p>This image was ſo horribly natural, that
it is not ſurpriſing Emily ſhould have miſtaken
it for the object it reſembled, nor,
ſince ſhe had heard ſuch an extraordinary
account, concerning the diſappearing of the
late lady of the caſtle, and had ſuch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the character of Montoni, that,
ſhe ſhould have believed this to be the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
body of the lady Laurentini, and that
he had been the contriver of her death.</p>
               <p>The ſituation, in which ſhe had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it, occaſioned her, at firſt, much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
and perplexity; but the vigilance, with
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0247300304:408"/>
which the doors of the chamber, where it
was depoſited, were afterwards ſecured, had
compelled her to believe, that Montoni,
not daring to confide the ſecret of her death
to any perſon, had ſuffered her remains to
decay in this obſcure chamber. The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the veil, however, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the doors having been left open,
even for a moment, had occaſioned her
much wonder and ſome doubts; but theſe
were not ſufficient to overcome her ſuſpicion
of Montoni; and it was the dread of
his terrible vengeance, that had ſealed her
lips in ſilence, concerning what ſhe had
ſeen in the weſt chamber.</p>
               <p>Emily, in diſcovering the Marchioneſs
de Villeroi to have been the ſiſter of Monſ.
St Aubert, was variouſly affected; but,
amidſt. the ſorrow, which ſhe ſuffered for
her untimely death, ſhe was releaſed from
an anxious and painful conjecture, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the raſh aſſertion of Signora Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentini,
concerning her birth and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of her parents. Her faith in St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0247300304:409"/>
principles would ſcarcely allow her to
ſuſpect that he had acted diſhonourably; and
ſhe felt ſuch reluctance to believe herſelf
the daughter of any other, than her, whom
ſhe had always conſidered and loved as a
mother, that ſhe would hardly admit ſuch
a circumſtance to be poſſible; yet the
likeneſs, which it had frequently been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
ſhe bore to the late Marchioneſs, the
former behaviour of Dorothée the old
houſekeeper, the aſſertion of Laurentini, and
the myſterious attachment, which St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
had diſcovered, awakened doubts, as to
his connection with the Marchioneſs, which
her reaſon could neither vanquiſh, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.
From theſe, however, ſhe was now
relieved, and all the circumſtances of her
father's conduct were fully explained; but
her heart was oppreſſed by the melancholy
cataſtrophe of her amiable relative, and by
the awful leſſon, which the hiſtory of
the nun exhibited, the indulgence of
whoſe paſſions had been the means of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her gradually to the commiſſion of a
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0247300304:410"/>
crime, from the prophecy of which in her
early years ſhe would have recoiled in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and exclaimed—that it could not be!—a
crime, which whole years of repentance
and of the ſevereſt penance had not been
able to obliterate from her conscience.</p>

            <p>AFTER the late diſcoveries, Emily was
diſtinguiſhed at the chateau by the Count
and his family, as a relative of the houſe of
Villeroi, and received, if poſſible, more
friendly attention, than had yet been ſhewn
her.</p>
            <p>Count De Villefort's ſurpriſe at the delay of
an anſwer to his letter, which had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to Valancourt, at Eſtuviere, was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with ſatisfaction for the prudence, which
had ſaved Emily from a share of the anxiety
he now differed, though, when he ſaw her ſtill
drooping under the effect of his former error,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0247300304:412"/>
all his reſolution was neceſſary to reſtrain him
from relating the truth, that would afford
her a momentary relief. The approaching
nuptials of the Lady Blanche now divided
his attention with this ſubject of his anxiety,
for the inhabitants of the chateau were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
buſied in preparations for that event,
and the arrival of Monſ. St. Foix was daily
expected. In the gaiety, which ſurrounded
her, Emily vainly tried to participate, her
ſpirits being depreſſed by the late diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and by the anxiety concerning the fate
of Valancourt, that had been occaſioned by
the deſcription of his manner, when he
had delivered the ring. She ſeemed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in it the gloomy wildneſs of deſpair;
and, when me conſidered to what that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
might have urged him, her heart ſunk
with terror and grief. The ſtate of ſuſpenſe,
as to his ſafety, to which ſhe believed herſelf
condemned, till ſhe ſhould return to La
Vallée, appeared inſupportable, and, in ſuch
moments, ſhe could not even ſtruggle to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0247300304:413"/>
aſſume the compoſure, that had left her
mind, but would often abruptly quit the
company ſhe was with, and endeavour to
ſooth her ſpirits in the deep ſolitudes of
the woods, that overbrowed the ſhore.
Here, the faint roar of foaming waves, that
beat below, and the ſullen murmur of the
wind among the branches around, were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
in uniſon with the temper of
her mind; and ſhe would sit on a cliff, or
on the broken ſteps of her favourite watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower,
obſerving the changing colours of
the evening clouds, and the gloom of twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
draw over the ſea, till the white tops
of billows, riding towards the ſhore, could
ſcarcely be diſcerned amidſt the darkened
waters. The lines, engraved by Valancourt
on this tower, ſhe frequently repeated with
melancholy enthuſiaſm, and then would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to check the recollections and the
grief they occaſioned, and to turn her
thoughts to indifferent ſubjects.</p>
            <p>One evening, having wandered with her
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0247300304:414"/>
lute to this her favourite ſpot, ſhe entered
the ruined tower, and aſcended a winding
ſtair caſe, that led to a ſmall chamber,
which was leſs decayed than the reſt of the
building;, and whence ſhe had often gazed,
with admiration, on the wide proſpect of
ſea and land, that extended below. The
ſun was now ſetting on that tract of the
Pyrenées, which divides Languedoc from
Rouſillon, and, placing herſelf oppoſite to
a ſmall grated window, which, like the
wood-tops beneath, and the waves lower ſtill,
gleamed with the red glow of the weſt, ſhe
touched the chords of her lute in ſolemn
ſymphony, and then accompanied it with
her voice, in one of the ſimple and affecting
airs, to which, in happier days, Valancourt
had often liſtened in rapture, and which
ſhe now adapted to the following lines.</p>

            <p>The ſoft tranquillity of the ſcene below,
where the evening breeze ſcarely curled
the water, of ſwelled the paſſing ſail, that
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0247300304:417"/>
caught the laſt gleam of the sun, and where,
now and then, a dipping oar was all that
diſturbed the trembling radiance, conſpired
with the tender melody of her lute to lull
her mind into a ſtate of gentle ſadneſs,
and ſhe ſung the mournful ſongs of
paſt times, till the remembrances they
awakened were too powerful for her heart,
her tears fell upon the lute, over which ſhe
drooped, and her voice trembled, and was
unable to proceed.</p>
            <p>Though the ſun had now sunk behind
the mountains, and even his reflected light
was fading from their higheſt points, Emily
did not leave the watch-tower, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to indulge her melancholy reverie,
till a footſtep, at a little diſtance, ſtartled
her, and, on looking through the grate, ſhe
obſerved a perſon walking below, whom,
however, ſoon perceiving to be Monſ. Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,
ſhe returned to the quiet thoughtfulneſs
his ſtep had interrupted. After ſome time,
ſhe again ſtruck her lute, and ſung her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
air; but again a ſtep diſturbed her,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0247300304:418"/>
and, as ſhe pauſed to liſten, ſhe heard it
aſcending the ſtair-caſe of the tower. The
gloom of the hour, perhaps, made her ſenſible
to ſome degree of fear, which ſhe
might not otherwife have felt; for, only a
few minutes before, ſhe had ſeen. Monſ.
Bonnac paſs. The ſteps were quick and
bounding, and, in the next moment, the
door of the chamber opened, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
entered, whoſe features were veiled in
the obſcurity of twilight; but his voice
could not be concealed, for it was the voice
of Valancourt! At the sound, never heard
by Emily, without emotion, ſhe ſtarted,
in terror, aſtoniſhment and doubtful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and had ſcarcely beheld him at, her
feet, when ſhe ſunk into a ſeat, overcome
by the various emotions, that contended at
her heart, and almoſt inſenſible to that voice,
whoſe earneſt and trembling calls ſeemed
as if endeavouring to ſave her. Valancourt,
as he hung over Emily, deplored his own
raſh impatience, in having thus ſurpriſed
her: for when he had arrived at the chateau,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0247300304:419"/>
too anxious to await the return of the
Count, who, he underſtood, was in the
grounds, he went himſelf to ſeek him, when,
as he paſſed the tower, he was ſtruck by
the ſound of Emily's voice, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
aſcended.</p>
            <p>It was a conſiderable time before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
but, when her recollection returned,
ſhe repulſed his attentions, with an air of
reſerve, and enquired, with as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
as it was poſſible ſhe could feel in
theſe firſt moments of his appearance, the
occaſion of his viſit.</p>
            <p>"Ah Emily!" ſaid Valancourt, "that
air, thoſe words—alas! I have, then, little
to hope—when you ceaſed to eſteem me,
you ceaſed alſo to love me!"</p>
            <p>"Moſt true, ſir," replied Emily, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to command her trembling voice;
"and if you had valued my eſteem, you
would not have given me this new occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for uneaſineſs."</p>
            <p>Valancourt's countenance changed ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
from the anxieties of doubt to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0247300304:420"/>
of ſurpriſe and diſmay: he was
ſilent a moment, and then ſaid, "I had
been taught to hope for a very different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception!
Is it, then true, Emily, that
I have lost your regard, forever? am I
to believe, that, though your eſteem for
me may return—your affection never can?
Can the Count have meditated the cruelty,
which now tortures me with a ſecond
death?"</p>
            <p>The voice, in which he ſpoke this,
alarmed Emily as much as his words ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
her, and, with trembling impatience,
ſhe begged that he would explain them.</p>
            <p>"Can any explanation be neceſſary?"
ſaid Valancourt, "do you not know how
cruelly my conduct has been miſrepreſented?
that the actions of which you once believed
me guilty (and, O Emily! how could you
ſo degrade me in your opinion, even for a
moment!) thoſe actions—I hold in as much
contempt and abhorrence as yourſelf?
Are you, indeed, ignorant, that Count De
Villefort has detected the ſlanders, that have
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0247300304:421"/>
robbed me of all I hold dear on earth, and
has invited me hither to juſtify to you my
former conduct? It is ſurely impoſſible
you can be uninformed of theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and I am again torturing myſelf
with a falſe hope!</p>
            <p>The ſilence of Emily confirmed this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
for the deep twilight would not
allow Valancourt to diſtinguiſh the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and doubting joy, that fixed her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For a moment, ſhe continued unable
to ſpeak; then a profound ſigh deemed to
give ſome relief to her ſpirits, and ſhe
ſaid,</p>
            <p>"Valancourt! I was, till this moment,
ignorant of all the circumſtances you have
mentioned; the emotion I now ſuffer may
aſſure you of the truth of this, and, that,
though I had ceaſed to eſteem, I had not
taught myſelf entirely to forget you."</p>
            <p>"This moment," ſaid Valancourt, in a
low voice, and leaning for ſupport againſt
the window—"this moment brings with
it a conviction that overpowers me!—I am
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0247300304:422"/>
dear to you then—ſtill dear to you my
Emily!"</p>
            <p>"Is it neceſſary that I ſhould tell you to:"
ſhe replied, "is it neceſſary, that I ſhould
ſay—theſe are the firſt moments of joy
I have known, ſince your departure, and
that they repay me for all thoſe of pain I
have ſuffered in the interval?"</p>
            <p>"Valancourt ſighed deeply and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to reply but as the preſſed her hand
to his lips the tears that fell over it ſpoke
a language, which could not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and to which words were inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate.</p>
            <p>Emily, ſomewhat tranquillized, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
returning to the chateau, and then,
for the firſt time recollected that the Count
had invited Valancourt thither to explain
his conduct, and that no explanation had
yet been given. But, while ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
this, her heart would not allow her
to dwell, for a moment, on the poſſibility of
his unworthineſs; his look, his voice, his
manner, all ſpoke the noble ſincerity, which
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0247300304:423"/>
had formerly diſtinguiſhed him; and ſhe
again permitted herſelf to indulge the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a joy, more ſurpriſing and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than ſhe had ever before experienced.</p>
            <p>Neither Emily or Valancourt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
how they reached the chateau whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they might have been transferred by
the ſpell of a fairy for any thing they could
remember; and it was not till they had
reached the great hall, that either of them
recollected there were other perſons in the
world beſides themſelves The count then
came forth with ſurpriſe and with the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of pure benevolence to welcome
Valancourt and to entreat his forgivenneſs
of the injuſtice he had done him ſoon
after which Monſ. Bonnac joined this
happy group, in which, he and Valancourt
were mutually rejoiced to meet.</p>
            <p>When the firſt congratulations were over,
and the general joy became ſomewhat more
tranquil, the Count withdrew with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
to the library, where a long conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
palled between them, in which the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0247300304:424"/>
latter ſo clearly juſtified himſelf of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
parts of the conduct, imputed to
him, and ſo candidly confeſſed and ſo feel
ingly lamented the follies, which he had
committed, that the Count was confirmed
in the belief of all he had hoped; and,
while he perceived ſo many noble virtues
in Valancourt, and that experience had
taught him to deteſt the follies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had only not admired, he did not
ſcruple to believe, that he would paſs
through life with the dignity of a wiſe and
good man, or to entruſt to his care the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
happineſs of Emily St. Aubert, for
whom he felt the ſolicitude of a parent.
Of this he ſoon informed her, in a ſhort
converſation, when Valancourt had left
him. While Emily liſtened to a relation
of the ſervices, that Valancourt had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Monſ. Bonnac, her eyes overſlowed
with tears of pleaſure, and the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of Count De Villefort perfectly
diſſipated every doubt, as to the paſt and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
conduct of him, to whom the now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0247300304:425"/>
without fear, the eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with which ſhe had formerly received
him.</p>
            <p>When they returned to the ſupper-room,
the Counteſs and Lady Blanche met Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
with ſincere congratulations; and
Blanche, indeed, was ſo much rejoiced to
ſee Emily returned to happineſs, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
for a while, that Monſ. St. Foix was
not yet arrived at the chateau, though he
had been expected for ſome hours; but her
generous ſympathy was, ſoon after, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by his appearance. He was now
perfectly recovered from the wounds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
during his perilous adventure
among the Pyrenées, the mention of which
ſerved to heighten to the parties, who had
been involved in it, the ſenſe of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
happineſs. New congratulations paſſed
between them, and round the ſupper-table
appeared a group of faces, ſmiling with
felicity, but with a felicity, which had in
each a different character. The ſmile of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0247300304:426"/>
Blanche was frank and gay, that of Emily
tender and penſive; Valancourt's was rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous,
tender and gay alternately; Monſ.
St. Foix's was joyous, and that of the
Count, as he looked on the ſurrounding
party, expreſſed the tempered complacency
of benevolence; while the features of the
Counteſs, Henri, and Monſ. Bonnac, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
fainter traces of animation. Poor
Monſ. Dupont did not, by his preſence,
throw a ſhade of regret over the company;
for when he had diſcovered, that Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
was not unworthy of the eſteem of
Emily, he determined ſeriouſly to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at the conqueſt of his own hopeleſs
affection, and had immediately withdrawn
from Chateau-le-Blanc—a conduct, which
Emily now underſtood, and rewarded with
her admiration and pity.</p>
            <p>The Count and his gueſts continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
till a late hour, yielding to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of ſocial gaiety, and to the ſweets of
friendſhip. When Annette heard of the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0247300304:427"/>
arrival of Valancourt, Ludovico had ſome
difficulty to prevent her going into the
ſupper-room, to expreſs her joy, for ſhe
declared, that ſhe had never been ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
at any <hi>accident</hi> as this, ſince ſhe had
found Ludovico himſelf.</p>

            <p>THE marriages of the Lady Blanche
and Emily St. Aubert were celebrated, on
the ſame day, and with the ancient baronial
magnificence, at Chateau-le-Blanc. The
feaſts were held in the great hall of
the caſtle, which, on this occaſion, was
hung with ſuperb new tapeſtry, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the exploits of Charlemagne and his
twelve peers; here, were ſeen the Saracens,
with their horrible viſors, advancing to
battle; and there, were diſplayed the wild
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0247300304:429"/>
ſolemnities of incantation, and the necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
feats, exhibited by the magician
<hi>Jarl</hi> before the Emperor. The ſumptuous
banners of the family of Villeroi, which
had long ſlept in duſt, were once more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furled,
to wave over the gothic points of
painted caſements; and muſic echoed, in
many a lingering cloſe, through every wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gallery and colonnade of that vaſt
edifice.</p>
            <p>As Annette looked down from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridor
upon the hall, whoſe arches and
windows were illuminated with brilliant
feſtoons of lamps, and gazed on the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
dreſſes of the dancers, the coſtly live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the attendants, the canopies of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
velvet and gold, and liſtened to the gay
ſtrains that floated along the vaulted roof,
ſhe almoſt fancied herſelf in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
palace, and declared, that ſhe had
not met with any place, which charmed
her ſo much, ſince ſhe read the fairy tales;
nay, that the fairies themſelves, at their
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0247300304:430"/>
nightly revels in this old hall, could diſplay
nothing finer; while old Dorothée, as ſhe
ſurveyed the ſcene, ſighed, and ſaid, the
caſtle looked as it was wont to do in the
time of her youth.</p>
            <p>After gracing the feſtivities of Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-Blanc,
for ſome days, Valancourt and
Emily took leave of their kind friends, and
returned to La Vallée, where the faithful
Thereſa received them with unſeigned joy,
and the pleaſant ſhades welcomed them
with a thouſand tender and affecting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances;
and, while they wandered
together over the ſcenes, ſo long inhabited
by the late Monſ. and Madame St. Aubert,
and Emily pointed out, with penſive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
their favourite haunts, her preſent
happineſs was heightened, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it would have been worthy of
their approbation, could they have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
it.</p>
            <p>Valancourt led her to the plane tree on
the terrace, where he had firſt ventured
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0247300304:431"/>
to declare his love, and where now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the anxiety he had then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and the retroſpect of all the dangers
and misfortunes they had each encountered,
ſince laſt they ſat together beneath its
broad branches, exalted the ſenſe of their
preſent felicity, which, on this ſpot, ſacred
to the memory of St. Aubert, they ſolemnly
vowed to deſerve, as far as poſſible, by
endeavouring to imitate his benevolence,—by
remembering, that ſuperior attainments
of every fort bring with them duties of
ſuperior exertion,—and by affording to their
fellow-beings, together with that portion of
ordinary comforts, which proſperity always
owes to misfortune, the example of lives
paſſed in happy thankfulneſs to GOD, and,
therefore, in careful tenderneſs to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Soon after their return to La Vallée,
the brother of Valancourt came to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
him on his marriage, and to pay his
reſpects to Emily, with whom he was ſo
much pleaſed, as well as with the proſpect
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0247300304:432"/>
of rational happineſs, which theſe nuptials
offered to Valancourt, that he immediately
reſigned to him a part of the rich domain,
the whole of which, as he had no family,
would of courſe deſcend to his brother, on
his deceaſe.</p>
            <p>The eſtates, at Tholouſe, were diſpoſed
of, and Emily purchaſed of Monſ. Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
the ancient domain of her late father,
where, having given Annette a marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
ſhe ſettled her as the houſekeeper,
and Ludovico as the ſteward; but, ſince
both Valancourt and herſelf preferred the
pleaſant and long-loved ſhades of La Vallée
to the magnificence of Epourville, they
continued to reſide there, paſſing, however,
a few months in the year at the birth-place
of St. Aubert, in tender reſpect to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>The legacy, which had been bequeathed
to Emily by Signora Laurentini, ſhe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Valancourt would allow her to reſigh
to Monſ. Bonnac; and Valancourt, when
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0247300304:433"/>
ſhe made the requeſt, felt all the value of
the compliment it conveyed. The caſtle
of Udolpho, alſo, deſcended to the wife of
Monſ. Bonnac, who was the neareſt ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relation of the houſe of that name, and
thus affluence reſtored his long-oppreſſed
ſpirits to peace, and his family to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>O! how joyful it is to tell of happineſs,
ſuch as that of Valancourt and Emily; to
relate, that, after ſuffering under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the vicious and the diſdain of
the weak, they were, at length, reſtored to
each other—to the beloved landſcapes of
their native country,—to the ſecureſt feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of this life, that of aſpiring to moral
and labouring for intellectual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—to
the pleaſures of enlightened
ſociety, and to the exerciſe of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which had always animated their
hearts; while the bowers of La Vallée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
once more, the retreat of goodneſs,
wiſdom and domeſtic bleſſedneſs!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:0247300304:434"/>
O! uſeful-may it be to have ſhewn,
that, though the vicious can ſometimes
pour affliction upon the good, their power
is tranſient and their puniſhment certain;
and that innocence, though oppreſſed by
injuſtice, ſhall, ſupported by patience,
finally triumph over misfortune!</p>
            <p>And, if the weak hand, that has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
this tale, has, by its ſcenes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
the mourner of one hour of ſorrow,
or, by its moral, taught him to ſuſtain it—the
effort, however humble, has not
been vain, nor is the writer unrewarded.</p>
