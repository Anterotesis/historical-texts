            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Idomeneus</hi> appears at large in this Book, whoſe Character (if I take it right) is ſuch as we ſee pretty often in common Life: A Perſon of the firſt Rank, ſufficient enough of his high Birth, growing into Years, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his Decline in Strength and active Qualities; and therefore endeavouring to make it up to himſelf in Dignity, and to preſerve the Veneration of others. The true Picture of a ſtiff old Soldier, not willing to loſe any of the Reputation
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0356100104:65"/>
he has acquir'd; yet not inconſiderate in Danger; but by the Senſe of his Age, and by his Experience in Battel, become too cautious to engage with any great odds againſt him: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful and tender of his Soldiers, whom he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo long that they were become old Acquaintance; (ſo that it was with great Judgment <hi>Homer</hi> choſe to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him here, in performing a kind Office to one of 'em who was wounded.) Talkative upon Subjects of War, as afraid that others might loſe the Memory of what he had done in better Days, of which the long Converſation with <hi>Meriones,</hi> and <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Reproach to him in Iliad 23. ℣. 478. are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Proofs. One may obſerve ſome Strokes of Lordlineſs and State in his Character: That Reſpect <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſeems careful to treat him with, and the particular Diſtinctions ſhewn him at Table, are mention'd in a manner that inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates they were Points upon which this Prince not a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. <hi>Il.</hi> 4. ℣. 257, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The vaunting of his Family in this Book, together with his Sarcaſms and contemptuous Railleries on his dead Enemies, ſavour of the ſame Turn of Mind. And it ſeems there was among the Ancients a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Idomeneus</hi> which ſtrengthens this Conjecture of his Pride: For we find in the <hi>Heroicks</hi> of <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would come to the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, he demanded a Share in the ſovereign Command with <hi>Agamemnon</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I muſt, upon this occaſion, make an Obſervation once for all, which will be applicable to many Paſſages in <hi>Homer,</hi> and afford a Solution of many Difficulties. It is that our Author drew ſeveral of his Characters with an Eye to the Hiſtories then known of famous Perſons, or the Traditions that paſt in thoſe Times. One cannot believe otherwiſe of a Poet, who appears ſo nicely exact in obſerving all the Cuſtoms of the Age he deſcribed; nor can we imagine the infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of minute Circumſtances relating to particular Perſons, which we meet with every where in his Poem, could poſſibly have been invented purely as Ornaments to it. This Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will account for a hundred ſeeming Oddneſſes not only in the <hi>Characters,</hi> but in the <hi>Speeches</hi> of the Iliad: For as no Author is more true than <hi>Homer</hi> to the Character of the Perſon he introduces ſpeaking, ſo no one more often ſuits his

Oratory to the Character of the Perſon ſpoken to. Many of theſe Beauties muſt needs be loſt to us, yet this Suppoſition will give a new Light to ſeveral Particulars. For inſtance, the Speech I have been mentioning of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus</hi> in the 4<hi>th</hi> Book, wherein he puts this Hero in mind of the magnificent Entertainments he had given him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in this View much leſs odd and ſurprizing. Or who can tell but it had ſome Alluſion to the Manners of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> whom he commanded, whoſe Character was ſo well known, as to become a Proverb: <hi>The</hi> Cretans, <hi>evil Beaſts, and ſlow Bellies.</hi>

of a Spear, he yet ſeems unſatisfy'd with the Excuſe; adding, that he himſelf did not approve of that diſtant manner of fighting with a Spear: <hi>Meriones</hi> being touch'd to the quick with this Reproach, replies, that He of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> had the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect his Courage: Whereupon <hi>Idome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> perceiving him highly piqued, aſſures him he entertains no ſuch hard Thoughts of him, ſince he had often known his Courage prov'd on ſuch Occaſions, where the Danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater, and the Number ſmaller, it was impoſſible for a Coward to conceal his natural Infirmity: But now recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that a malicious Mind might give a ſiniſter Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Inactivity during this Diſcourſe, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately breaks it off upon that Reflection.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0356100104:72"/>
whereby the enclos'd Armies are compell'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any Poſſibility on either ſide to ſeparate or to conquer; there is not perhaps in <hi>Homer</hi> any Image at once ſo exact and ſo bold. Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> acknowledges, that deſpairing to make this Paſſage ſhine in her Language, ſhe purpoſely omitted it in her Tranſlation: But from what ſhe ſays in her Annotations, it ſeems that ſhe did not rightly apprehend the Propriety and Beauty of it. <hi>Hobbes</hi> too was not very ſenſible of it, when he tranſlated it ſo oddly.<q>

                  <p>VERSE 451.] It will be neceſſary, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Conduct of <hi>Homer</hi> in every Battel he deſcribes, to reflect on the particular kind of Fight, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that diſtinguiſh each. In this View therefore we ought to remember thro' this whole Book, that the Battel deſcrib'd in it, is a fix'd cloſe Fight, wherein the Armies engage in a groſs compact Body, without any of thoſe Skirmiſhes or Feats of Activity ſo often mention'd in the foregoing Engagements. We ſee at the beginning of it the <hi>Grecians</hi> form a Phalanx, ℣. 126. which continues unbroken at the very end, ℣. 806. The chief Weapon made uſe of is a Spear, being moſt proper for this manner of Combat; nor do we ſee any other uſe of a Chariot, but to carry off the dead or wounded (as in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Harpalion</hi> and <hi>Deiphobus.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>From hence we may obſerve, with what Judgment and Propriety <hi>Homer</hi> introduces <hi>Idomeneus</hi> as the chief in Action on this occaſion: For this Hero being declined from his Prime, and ſomewhat ſtiff with Years, was only fit for this kind of Engagement, as <hi>Homer</hi> expreſſly ſays in the 512th Verſe of the preſent Book.<q>

                     </q> It ſeems (ſays <hi>Euſtathius</hi> on this Place) that the Iliad being an heroick Poem, is of too ſerious a Nature to admit of Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery: Yet <hi>Homer</hi> has found the ſecret of joining two things that are in a manner incompatible. For this Piece of Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery is ſo far from raiſing Laughter, that it becomes a Hero, and is capable to enflame the Courage of all who hear it. It alſo elevates the Character of <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is in the midſt of imminent Dangers, preſerves his uſual Gaiety of Temper, which is the greateſt Evidence of an uncommon Courage. <hi>Id. p.</hi> 935.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I am of an Opinion very different from this of <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> which is alſo adopted by M. <hi>Dacier.</hi> So ſevere and bloody an Irony to a dying Perſon is a fault in Morals, if not in Poetry itſelf. It ſhould not have place at all, or if it ſhould, is ill placed here. <hi>Idomeneus</hi> is repreſented a brave Man, nay a Man of a compaſſionate Nature, in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he was introduc'd in, of aſſiſting a wounded Soldier. What Provocation could ſuch an one have, to inſult ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly an unfortunate Prince, being neither his Rival nor particular Enemy? True Courage is inſeparable from Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and all generous Warriors regret the very Victories they gain, when they reflect what a Price of Blood they coſt. I know it may be anſwer'd, that theſe were not the Manners of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Time, a Spirit of Violence and Devaſtation then reigned, even among the choſen People of God, as may be ſeen from the Actions of <hi>Joſhua, &amp;c.</hi> However, if one would forgive the <hi>Cruelty,</hi> one cannot forgive the <hi>Gaiety</hi> on ſuch an occaſion. Theſe inhuman Jeſts the Poet was ſo far from being oblig'd to make, that he was on the contrary forced to break through the general ſerious Air of his Poem
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0356100104:74"/>
to introduce them. Would it not raiſe a Suſpicion, that (whatever we ſee of his ſuperior Genius in other reſpects) his own Views of Morality were not elevated above the Barbarity of his Age? I think indeed the thing by far the moſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Author, is that Spirit of Cruelty which appears too manifeſtly in the Iliad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> was too judicious to imitate <hi>Homer</hi> in theſe Licences, and is much more reſerv'd in his Sarcaſms and Inſults. There are not above four or five in the whole <hi>Aeneid.</hi> That of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to <hi>Priam</hi> in the ſecond Book, tho' barbarous in itſelf, may be accounted for as intended to raiſe a Character of Horror, and render the Action of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> odious; whereas <hi>Homer</hi> ſtains his moſt Favourite Characters with theſe Barbarities. That of <hi>Aſcanius</hi> over <hi>Numanus</hi> in the ninth, was a fair Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity where <hi>Virgil</hi> might have indulg'd the Humour of a cruel Raillery, and have been excus'd by the Youth and Gaiety of the Speaker; yet it is no more than a very moderate Anſwer to the Inſolences with which he had juſt been provok'd by his Enemy, only retorting two of his own Words upon him.

                     <hi>Homer</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways careful to diſtinguiſh each Scene of Action, gives a very particular Deſcription of the Station of the Ships, ſhewing in what manner they lay drawn up on the Land. This he had only hinted at before; but here taking occaſion on the wounded Heroes coming from their Ships, which were at a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0356100104:125"/>
diſtance from the Fight (while others were engag'd in the Defence of thoſe Ships where the Wall was broke down) he tells us, that the Shore of the Bay (comprehended between the <hi>Rhaetean</hi> and <hi>Sigaean</hi> Promontories) was not ſufficient to contain the Ships in one Line; which they were therefore obliged to draw up in Ranks, ranged in parallel Lines along the Shore. How many of theſe Lines there were, the Poet does not determine. M. <hi>Dacier,</hi> without giving any reaſon for her Opinion, ſays they were but two; one advanced near the Wall, the other on the Verge of the Sea. But it is more than probable, that there were ſeveral intermediate Lines; ſince the Order in which the Veſſels lay is here deſcrib'd by a Metaphor taken from the Steps of a <hi>Scaling-Ladder;</hi> which had been no way proper to give an Image only of two Ranks, but very fit to repreſent a greater, tho' undetermin'd Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. That there were more than two Lines, may likewiſe be inferr'd from what we find in the beginning of the 11<hi>th</hi> Book; where it is ſaid, that the Voice of <hi>Diſcord,</hi> ſtanding on the Ship of <hi>Ulyſſes, in the middle of the Fleet,</hi> was heard as far as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Ajax, whoſe Ships were drawn up in the two Extremities:</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Ajax</hi> were neareſt the Wall (as is expreſly ſaid in the 68<hi>th</hi> Verſe of the 13<hi>th</hi> Book) and thoſe of <hi>Achilles</hi> neareſt the Sea, as appears from many Paſſages ſcatter'd thro' the Iliad.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be ſuppos'd, that thoſe Ships were drawn higheſt upon Land, which firſt approached the Shore; the firſt Line therefore conſiſted of thoſe who firſt diſembark'd, which were the Ships of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Proteſilaus;</hi> the latter of whom ſeems mention'd in the Verſe above cited of the 13<hi>th</hi> Book, only to give occaſion to obſerve this, for he was ſlain as he landed firſt of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And accordingly we ſhall ſee in the 15<hi>th</hi> Book, it is his Ship that is firſt attack'd by the <hi>Trojans,</hi> as it lay the neareſt to them.</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe gueſs how it happens, that the Ships of <hi>Achilles</hi> were plac'd neareſt to the Sea; for in the Anſwer of <hi>Achilles</hi> to <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in the 9<hi>th</hi> Book, ℣. 328. he mentions a Naval Expedition he had made while <hi>Agamemnon</hi> lay ſafe in the Camp: So that his Ships at their Return did natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lie next the Sea; which, without this Conſideration,

Even thoſe who have ſpoken more ſagely than the reſt, of their Nature, could not forbear to ſpeak extravagantly of their Conduct. When they eſtabliſh their Being and their Attributes, they make them immortal, infinite, almighty, perfectly wiſe, and perfectly good: But the Moment they repreſent them acting, there's no Weakneſs to which they do not make 'em ſtoop, and no Folly or Wickedneſs they do not make 'em commit."</q> The ſame Author anſwers this in another Place by remarking, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that Truth was not the Inclination of the firſt Ages: A fooliſh Lye or a lucky Falſhood gave Reputation to Impoſtors, and Pleaſure to the credulous. 'Twas the whole Secret of the great and the wiſe to govern the ſimple and ignorant Herd.

                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt needs, upon the whole, as far as I can judge, give up the Morality of this Fable; but what Colour of Excuſe for it <hi>Homer</hi> might have from ancient Tradition, or what myſtical or allegorical Senſe might attone for the appearing Impiety, is hard to be aſcertain'd at this diſtant Period of Time. That there had been before his Age a Tradition of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s being laid aſleep, appears from the Story of <hi>Hercules</hi> at <hi>Coos,</hi> referr'd to by our Author, ℣. 285. There is alſo a Paſſage in <hi>Diodorus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7. which gives ſome ſmall Light to this Fiction. Among other Reaſons which that Hiſtorian lays down to prove that <hi>Homer</hi> travell'd into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he alledges this Paſſage of the Interview of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> which he ſays was grounded upon an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Feſtival, <hi>whereon the nuptial Ceremonies of theſe two Deities were celebrated, at which time both their Tabernacles, adorned with all ſorts of Flowers, are carry'd by the Prieſts to the top of a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Indeed as the greateſt Part of the Ceremonies of the ancient Religions conſiſted in ſome ſymbolical Repreſentations of certain Actions of their Gods, or rather deify'd Mortals, ſo a great part of ancient Poetry conſiſted in the Deſcription of the Actions exhibited in theſe Ceremonies. The Loves of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis</hi> are a remarkable Inſtance of this kind, which, tho' under different Names, were celebrated by annual Repreſentations, as well in <hi>Egypt</hi> as in ſeveral Nations of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> and to the Images which were carry'd in theſe Feſtivals, ſeveral ancient Poets were indebted for their moſt happy Deſcriptions. If the Truth of this Obſervation of <hi>Diodorus</hi> be admitted, the preſent Paſſage will appear with more Dignity, being grounded on Religion; and the Conduct of the Poet will be more juſtifiable, if that, which has been generally accounted an indecent wanton Fiction, ſhould prove to be the Repreſentation of a religious Solemnity. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great Ignorance we are in of many ancient ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Ceremonies, there may be probably in <hi>Homer</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Incidents entirely of this Nature; wherefore we ought to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0356100104:131"/>
be reſerv'd in our Cenſures, leſt what we decry as wrong in the Poet, ſhould prove only a Fault in his Religion. And indeed it would be a very unfair way to tax any People, or any Age whatever, with Groſſneſs in general, purely from the groſs or abſurd Ideas or Practices that are to be found in their Religions.</p>
                  <p>In the next Place, if we have recourſe to Allegory, (which ſoftens and reconciles every thing) it may be imagin'd that by the Congreſs of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> is meant the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of the <hi>Aether</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> (which are generally ſaid to be ſignify'd by theſe two Deities.) The Ancients believ'd the <hi>Aether</hi> to be Igneous, and that by its kind Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Air it was the Cauſe of all Vegetation: To which nothing more exactly correſponds, than the Fiction of the Earth putting forth her Flowers immediately upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. <hi>Virgil</hi> has ſome Lines in the ſecond <hi>Georgic,</hi> that ſeem a perfect Explanation of the Fable into this Senſe. In deſcribing the Spring, he hints as if ſomething of a vivifying Influence was at that time ſpread from the upper Heavens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air. He calls <hi>Jupiter</hi> expreſly <hi>Aether,</hi> and repreſents him operating upon his Spouſe for the Production of all things.<q>

                     <q rend="inline">VERSE 67. Greece <hi>chas'd by</hi> Troy, &amp;c.]</q> In this Diſcourſe of <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Poet opens his Deſign, by giving his Readers a Sketch of the principal Events he is to expect. As this Conduct of <hi>Homer</hi> may to many appear no way artful, and ſince it is a principal Article of the Charge brought againſt him by ſome late <hi>French</hi> Criticks, it will not be improper here to look a little into this Diſpute. The Caſe will be beſt ſtated by tranſlating the following Paſſage from Mr. <hi>de la Motte</hi>'s <hi>Reflections ſur la Critique.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I could not forbear wiſhing that <hi>Homer</hi> had an Art, which he ſeems to have neglected, that of preparing Events without making them known beforehand, ſo that when they happen one might be ſurprized agreeably. I could not be quite ſatisfied to hear <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the middle of the Iliad, give an exact Abridgment of the Remainder of the Action. Mad. <hi>Dacier</hi> alledges as an Excuſe, that this paſt only between <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno;</hi> as if the Reader was not let into the Secret, and had not as much ſhare in the Confidence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>She adds, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that as we are capable of a great deal of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the Repreſentation of a Tragedy which we have ſeen before, ſo the Surprizes which I require are no way neceſſary to our Entertainment. This I think a pure Piece of Sophiſtry: One may have two ſorts of Pleaſure at the Repreſentation of a Tragedy; in the firſt place, that of taking part in an Action of Importance the firſt time it paſſes before our Eyes, of being agitated by Fear and Hope for the Perſons one is moſt concern'd about, and in fine, of partaking their Felicity or Misfortune, as they happen to ſucceed, or be diſappointed.
<p>"This therefore is the firſt Pleaſure which the Poet ſhould deſign to give his Auditors, to tranſport them by pathetic
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0356100104:202"/>
Surprizes which excite Terror or Pity. The ſecond Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure muſt proceed from a View of that Art which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has ſhewn in raiſing the former.</p>
                        <p>"'Tis true, when we have ſeen a Piece already, we have no longer that firſt Pleaſure of the Surprize, at leaſt not in all its Vivacity; but there ſtill remains the ſecond, which could never have its turn, had not the Poet labour'd ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully to excite the firſt, it being upon that indiſpenſable Obligation that we judge of his Art.</p>
                        <p>"The Art therefore conſiſts in telling the Hearer only what is neceſſary to be told him, and in telling him only as much as is requiſite to the Deſign of pleaſing him. And altho' we know this already when we read it a ſecond time, we yet taſte the Pleaſure of that Order and Conduct which the Art required.</p>
                        <p>"From hence it follows, that every Poem ought to be contrived for the firſt Impreſſion it is to make. If it be otherwiſe, it gives us (inſtead of two Pleaſures which we expected) two ſorts of Diſguſts; the one, that of being cool and untouch'd when we ſhould be mov'd and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; the other, that of perceiving the Defect which caus'd that Diſguſt.</p>
                        <p>"This, in one word, is what I have found in the Iliad. I was not intereſted or touch'd by the Adventures, and I ſaw it was this cooling Preparation that prevented my being ſo."</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears clearly that M. <hi>Dacier</hi>'s Defence no way excuſes the Poet's Conduct; wherefore I ſhall add two or three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which may chance to ſet it in a better Light. It muſt be own'd that a Surprize artfully managed, which ariſes from unexpected Revolutions of great Actions, affects the Mind with a peculiar Delight: In this conſiſts the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Pleaſure of a Romance and well writ Tragedy. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, there is in the Relation of great Events a different kind of Pleaſure which ariſes from the artful unravelling a Knot of Actions, which we knew before in the groſs. This is a Delight peculiar to Hiſtory and Epic Poetry, which is founded on Hiſtory. In theſe kinds of writing, a preceding ſummary Knowledge of the Events deſcribed, does no way
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0356100104:203"/>
damp our Curioſity, but rather makes it more eager for the Detail. This is evident in a good Hiſtory, where ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Reader is affected with a greater Delight, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his preceding Knowledge of the Facts deſcribed: The Pleaſure in this caſe is like that of an Architect firſt viewing ſome magnificent Building, who was before well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Proportions of it. In an Epic Poem the caſe is of a like Nature; where, as if the hiſtorical Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were not ſufficient, the moſt judicious Poets never fail to excite their Reader's Curioſity by ſome ſmall Sketches of their Deſign; which like the Outlines of a fine Picture, will neceſſarily raiſe in us a greater deſire to ſee it in its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Colouring.</p>
                  <p>Had our Author been inclined to follow the Method of managing our Paſſions by Surprizes, he could not well have ſucceeded by this manner in the Subject he choſe to write upon, which being a Story of great Importance, the principal Events of which were well known to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it was not poſſible for him to alter the Ground-work of his Piece; and probably he was willing to mark by theſe Recapitulations how much of his Story was founded on hiſtorical Truths, and that what is ſuperadded were the poetical Ornaments.</p>
                  <p>There is another Conſideration worth remembring on this Head, to juſtify our Author's Conduct. It ſeems to have been an Opinion in theſe early times, deeply rooted in moſt Countries and Religions, that the Actions of Men were not only foreknown, but predeſtinated by a ſuperior Being. This Sentiment is very frequent in the moſt ancient Writers both ſacred and prophane, and ſeems a diſtinguiſhing Character of the Writings of the greateſt Antiquity. <hi>The Word of the Lord was fulfill'd,</hi> is the principal Obſervation in the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the declared and moſt obvious Moral of the Iliad. If this great Moral be fit to be repreſented in Poetry, what Means ſo proper to make it evident, as this introducing <hi>Jupiter</hi> foretelling the Events which he had decreed?</p>

No other Compariſon could have equall'd the Speed of an heavenly Being. To render this more beautiful and exact, the Poet deſcribes a Traveller who revolves in his Mind the ſeveral Places which he has ſeen, and in an Inſtant paſſes in Imagination from one diſtant Part of the Earth to another. <hi>Milton</hi> ſeems to have had it in his Eye in that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Paſſage,

                  <p>WE have at the Entrance of this Book one of the moſt beautiful Parts of the Iliad. The two different Characters are admirably ſuſtain'd in the Dialogue of the two Heroes, wherein there is not a Period but ſtrongly marks not only their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper, but that particular Diſpoſition of Mind in either, which ariſes from the preſent State of Affairs. We ſee <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus</hi> touch'd with the deepeſt Compaſſion for the Misfortune of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (whom the <hi>Trojans</hi> had forc'd to retreat to their Ships, and which Ships were on the Point of burning) proſtrating himſelf before the Veſſel of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Tears at his Feet. <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſtruck with the Grief of his Friend, demands the Cauſe of it. <hi>Patroclus,</hi> pointing to the Ships, where the Flames already began to riſe, tells him he is harder than the Rocks or Sea which lay in proſpect before them, if he is not touch'd with ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Spectacle, and can ſee in cold Blood his Friends pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing before his Eyes. As nothing can be more natural and affecting than the Speech of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> ſo nothing is more lively and Pictureſque than the Attitude he is here deſcrib'd in.</p>

The <hi>Pathetic</hi> of <hi>Patroclus</hi>'s Speech is finely contraſted by the <hi>Fiertè</hi> of that of <hi>Achilles.</hi> While the former is melting with Sorrow for his Countrymen, the utmoſt he can hope from the latter, is but to borrow his Armour and Troops; to obtain his perſonal Aſſiſtance he knows is impoſſible. At the very Inſtant that <hi>Achilles</hi> is mov'd to ask the Cauſe of his Friend's Concern, he ſeems to ſay that nothing could deſerve it but the Death of their Fathers: and in the ſame Breath ſpeaks of the total Deſtruction of the <hi>Greeks</hi> as of too ſlight a Cauſe for Tears. <hi>Patroclus,</hi> at the opening of this Speech, dares not name <hi>Agamemnon</hi> even for being wounded; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has tried to bend him by all the Arguments that could affect an human Breaſt, concludes by ſuppoſing that ſome Oracle or ſupernatual Inſpiration is the Cauſe that with-holds his Arms. What can match the Fierceneſs of his Anſwer? Which implies, that not the Oracles of Heaven itſelf ſhould be regarded, if they ſtood in Competition with his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That if he yields, it muſt be thro' his own mere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: The only reaſon he has ever to yield, is that Nature itſelf cannot ſupport Anger eternally: And if he yields now, it is only becauſe he had before determin'd to do ſo at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, (<hi>Il.</hi> 9. ℣. 773.) That time was not till the Flames ſhould approach to his own Ships, till the laſt Article of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that not of Danger to <hi>Greece,</hi> but to himſelf. Thus his very Pity has the ſterneſt Qualifications in the World. After all, what is it he yields to? Only to ſuffer his Friend to go in his ſtead, juſt to ſave them from preſent Ruin, but he expreſſly forbids him to proceed any farther in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, than barely to put out the Fires, and ſecure his own and his Friend's Return into their Country: And all this concludes with a Wiſh, that (if it were poſſible) every <hi>Greek</hi> and every <hi>Trojan</hi> might periſh except themſelves. Such is that <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that more than Wrath, as the <hi>Greek</hi>

So that this became the only ſafe way of deliberating upon Affairs of any Conſequence, either publick or private. Whether to proclaim War, or conclude a Peace, to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a new Form of Government, or enact new Laws, all was to be done with the Advice and Approbation of the Oracle, whoſe Determinations were always held ſacred and inviolable. As to the Cauſes of Oracles, <hi>Jupiter</hi> was look'd upon as the firſt Cauſe of this, and all other ſorts of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; he had the Book of Fate before him, and out of that reveal'd either more or leſs, as he pleas'd, to inferior Daemons. But to argue more rationally, this way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Gods has been branded as one of the earlieſt and groſſeſt Pieces of Prieſtcraft, that obtain'd in the World. For the Prieſts, whoſe Dependance was on the Oracles, when they found the Cheat had got ſufficient footing, allow'd no Man to conſult the Gods without coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifices and rich Preſents to themſelves: And as few could bear this Expence, it ſerv'd to raiſe their Credit among the common People, by keeping them at an awful diſtance. And to heighten their Eſteem with the better and wealthier ſort, even they were only admitted upon a

few ſtated Days: By which the thing appear'd ſtill more myſterious, and for want of this good Management, muſt quickly have been ſeen through, and fell to the Ground. But whatever juggling there was as to the religious Part, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles had certainly a good Effect as to the Publick; being admirably ſuited to the Genius of a People, who would join in the moſt deſperate Expedition, and admit of any Change of Government, when they underſtood by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle it was the irreſiſtible Will of the Gods. This was the Method <hi>Minos, Lycurgus,</hi> and all the famous Lawgivers took; and indeed they found the People ſo entirely devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Part of Religion, that it was generally the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt, and ſometimes the only way of winning them into a Compliance. And then they took care to have them deliver'd in ſuch ambiguous Terms, as to admit of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conſtructions according to the Exigency of the Times; ſo that they were generally interpreted to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the State, unleſs ſometimes there happen'd to be Bribery, or Flattery in the Caſe; as when <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> complain'd that the <hi>Pythia</hi> ſpoke as <hi>Philip</hi> would have her. The moſt numerous, and of greateſt Repute were the Oracles of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who in Subordination to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> was appointed to preſide over, and inſpire all ſorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Diviners. And amongſt theſe, the <hi>Delphian</hi> challeng'd the firſt Place, not ſo much in reſpect of its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as its Perſpicuity and Certainty; inſomuch that the Anſwers of the <hi>Tripos</hi> came to be uſed proverbially for clear and infallible Truths. Here we muſt not omit the firſt <hi>Pythia</hi> or Prieſteſs of this famous Oracle in heroic Verſe. They found a ſecret Charm in Numbers, which made every thing look pompous and weighty. And hence it became the general Practice of Legiſlators, and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, to deliver their Laws and Maxims in that Dreſs: And ſcarce any thing in thoſe Ages was writ of Excellence or Moment but in Verſe. This was the Dawn of Poetry. which ſoon grew into Repute; and ſo long as it ſerv'd to ſuch noble Purpoſes as Religion and Government, Poets were highly honour'd, and admitted into a Share of the Adminiſtration. But by that time it arriv'd to any Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

The Explication of this word therefore muſt be elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſought, and I ſhall offer my Conjecture, which I ground upon the very Nature of this Oracle of <hi>Dodona,</hi> which was very different from all the other Oracles: In all other Temples the Prieſts deliver'd the Oracle which they had receiv'd from their Gods, immediately: But in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Dodona, Jupiter</hi> did not utter his Oracles to his Prieſts, but to his <hi>Selli;</hi> he render'd them to the Oaks, and the wonderful Oaks render'd them to the Prieſts, who declared them to thoſe who conſulted them: So theſe Prieſts were not properly <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The Poet in this Image of an Inundation, takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mention a Sentiment of great Piety, that ſuch Calamities were the Effects of divine Juſtice puniſhing the Sins of Mankind.

He has placed theſe Vulturs upon a high Rock, becauſe it is their Nature to perch there, rather than in the Boughs of Trees.

He was forced (continues my Author) to make uſe of theſe Machines, ſince there were no other Deities he could with any likelihood employ about this Work; for the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents (as appears from <hi>Euripides, Hippolyto</hi>) had a Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that all dead Bodies were offenſive to the Gods, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </p>
                  <p>But after all theſe refin'd Obſervations, it is probable the Poet intended only to repreſent the Death of this favourite Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and one of his moſt amiable Characters, in a gentle and agreeable View, without any Circumſtances of Dread or Horror; intimating by this Fiction, that he was delivered out of all the Tumults and Miſeries of Life by two imaginary Deities, <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> who alone can give Mankind Eaſe and Exemption from their Misfortunes.</p>

                     </gap> of Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> and others. I am ſenſible of the Extremes which Mankind run into, in extolling and depreciating Authors: We are not more violent and unreaſonable in attacking thoſe who are not yet eſtabliſh'd into Fame, than in defending thoſe who are, even in every minute Trifle. Fame is a Debt, which when we have kept from People as long as we can, we pay with a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intereſt, which amounts to twice the Value of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. Thus 'tis with ancient Works as with ancient Coins, they paſs for a vaſt deal more than they were worth at firſt; and the very Obſcurities and Deformities which Time has thrown upon them, are the ſacred Ruſt, which enhances their Value with all true Lovers of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>But as I have own'd what ſeem my Author's Faults, and ſubſcrib'd to the Opinion of <hi>Horace,</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> ſometimes nods; I think I ought to add that of <hi>Longinus</hi> as to ſuch Negligences. I can no way ſo well conclude the Notes to this Book as with the Tranſlation of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It may not be improper to diſcuſs the Queſtion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which of the two is the more eſtimable, a faulty Sublime, or a faultleſs Mediocrity? And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if of two Works, one has the greater Number of Beauties, and the other attains directly to the Sublime, which of theſe ſhall in Equity carry the Prize? I am really perſuaded that the true Sublime is incapable of that Purity which we find in Compoſitions of a lower Strain, and in effect that too much Accuracy ſinks the Spirit of an Author; whereas the Caſe is generally the ſame with the Favourites of Nature, and thoſe of Fortune, who with the beſt Oeconomy cannot, in the great Abundance they are bleſt with, attend to the minuter Articles of their Expence. Writers of a cool Imagination are cautious in their Management, and venture nothing, merely to gain the Character of being correct; but the Sublime is bold and enterprizing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that on every Advance the Danger encreaſeth. Here probably ſome will ſay that Men take a malicious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in expoſing the Blemiſhes of an Author; that his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0356100104:309"/>
Errors are never forgot, while the moſt exquiſite Beauties leave but very imperfect Traces on the Memory. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate this Objection I will ſolemnly declare, that in my Criticiſms on <hi>Homer</hi> and other Authors, who are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally allow'd to be authentic Standards of the Sublime, tho' I have cenſur'd their Failings with as much Freedom as any one, yet I have not preſum'd to accuſe them of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Faults, but have gently remark'd ſome little Defects and Negligences, which the Mind being intent on nobler Ideas did not condeſcend to regard. And on theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I will venture to lay it down for a Maxim, that the Sublime (purely on account of its Grandeur) is preferable to all other kinds of Style, however it may fall into ſome Inequalities. The Argonauticks of <hi>Apollonius</hi> are faultleſs in their kind; and <hi>Theocritus</hi> hath ſhewn the happieſt Vein imaginable for Paſtorals, excepting thoſe in which he has deviated from the Country: And yet if it were put to your Choice, would you have your Name deſcend to Poſterity with the Reputation of either of thoſe Poets, rather than with that of <hi>Homer?</hi> Nothing can be more correct than the <hi>Erigone</hi> of <hi>Eratoſthenes;</hi> but is he therefore a greater Poet than <hi>Archilochus,</hi> in whoſe Compoſures Perſpicuity and Order are often wanting; the divine Fury of his Genius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too impatient for Reſtraint, and ſuperior to Law? Again, do you prefer the Odes of <hi>Bacchilides</hi> to <hi>Pindar</hi>'s, or the Scenes of <hi>Ion</hi> of <hi>Chios</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Sophocles?</hi> Their Writings are allow'd to be correct, polite, and delicate; whereas, on the other Hand, <hi>Pindar</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hurry on with the greateſt Impetuoſity, and like a devouring Flame ſeize and ſet on Fire whatever comes in their way; but on a ſudden the Conflagration is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, and they moſt miſerably flag when no body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects it. Yet none have ſo little Diſcernment as not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſingle <hi>Oedipus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles</hi> to all the Tragedies that <hi>Ion</hi> ever brought on the Stage.<p>"In our Deciſions therefore on the Characters of theſe great Men, who have illuſtrated what is uſeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary with all the Graces and Elevation of Style; we muſt impartially confeſs that, with all their Errors, they have
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0356100104:310"/>
more Perfections than the Nature of Man can almoſt be conceiv'd capable of attaining: For 'tis merely human to excell in other kinds of Writing, but the Sublime enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth our Nature, and makes near Approaches to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: He who commits no Faults, is barely read without Cenſure; but a Genius truly great excites Admiration.
