            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Moſt Noble and Mighty PRINCE,
WILLIAM
Duke of DEVONSHIRE,
Lord STEWARD of Her Majeſty's Houſhold,
AND
Knight of the moſt Noble Order of the

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF the following POEM had been written by a
Perſon who had a Genius equal to the Subject, it
would in a peculiar manner have belong'd to Your
Grace: For to whom ſhould a Poet ſooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
the Praiſes of a King, who will be eternally Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
for the Reſtoring and Maintaining our Liberties,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0664700400:3"/>
and the common Liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> than to Your
Grace, who has always appear'd ſo Great a Defender of
them, and has ventur'd, and done, and ſuffer'd for them
more than any Subject in <hi>England?</hi> The ardent Love of
Liberty and of Your Country, are ſome of the many
Heroick Qualities which You have inherited from Your
Noble Anceſtors, and ſome of the many which Your
Grace has the Happineſs to ſee deriv'd from Your
Noble Self by the other Hope of Your Auguſt Family.
The Wiſdom, Foreſight, Reſolution, and Greatneſs of
Soul that the Brave Lord <hi>Candiſh</hi> ſo conſtantly ſhew'd in
the laſt Parliaments of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, will never
be forgotten as long as an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> remains alive.
Ev'n then when it was eſteem'd by ſome an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Crime to be thought one, even then Your Grace
and that Illuſtrious Friend, whoſe Memory ſhall always
be Dear to all the faithful Lovers of their Country, both
of You heroically dar'd to appear at the Head of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
reſolv'd to aſſert their Privileges. He gloriouſly
ſeal'd the Love of his Country with his Blood; but even
after the Loſs of the beſt of Friends, Your Grace perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with an undaunted Spirit in the Noble Cauſe of
Liberty. Nor could the juſt Grief which You paid
to his Memory, hinder You from paying that Duty
which You ow'd to Your Country, which has always
deſervedly been Your firſt Affection. If ſome other
Perſons at that time would have entred into the Wiſdom
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0664700400:4"/>
of both Your Counſels, You your ſelves had ſaved
us without the Help of the King; Your Noble Friend,
as Your Grace's Self, had been one of the living Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Your delivered Country, and there had been
no need of the Revolution, nor perhaps of the long
War that ſucceeded it. It was neither His nor Your
Grace's Fault that You were not then ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded,
and conſequently that You did not ſave theſe
Nations all that Blood and Treaſure which the War has
coſt them. But when afterwards things were brought
to that Extremity that a Revolution was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
no Man did more than Your Grace towards the
bringing it about, and working our Deliverance that
way. Your Grace was then the moſt Glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of eſtabliſhing the beſt of Kings upon the
Throne of <hi>England,</hi> and defending her preſent Majeſty
at ſo dangerous a Juncture as that of the Revolution.
She wiſely thought that She could have no where recourſe
to a better Place for Her Safety, than where Your Grace
was known to direct by Your Counſels, and to animate
by Your Courage the Brave Aſſertors of Liberty.</p>
            <p>I have a long time deſign'd to lay ſomething of
mine at Your Grace's Feet, that it might live, and grow
and flouriſh under ſo Illuſtrious a Patronage. But the
Awe that I ſtood in of the Force of Your Judgment,
and the Fineneſs of Your Diſcernment, made me wait
for this Opportunity: For I know very well, that I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0664700400:5"/>
ought never to approach You this way at all
or to do it when I can be moſt ſecure of my ſelf. And
tho what I offer You now is far from meriting ſo High a
Protection, yet I have leſs Miſtruſt of it than of any
thing I have done in Poetry. Beſides, the Deſign and
the Immortal Subject may ſupply in ſome meaſure the
Weakneſs of my Performance: For I am confident
that Your Grace will not refuſe to grant that Protection
to the Vindication of the King's Memory, which the
King at Your Grace's Requeſt granted to the Rights and
Privileges of every <hi>Engliſhman.</hi> I am,</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Poem was writ without any manner
of Deſign of obliging or offending a Party. For in
all my Life-time I never deſigned either to pleaſe or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
any, and was always of Opinion that he who makes his Court
to any, is ſure to do it to the wrong; for if all Men were for the
Publick Good, there never could be any Party, becauſe a Patriot
deſigns the Good of his Country, but one of a Party intends his
own.</p>
            <p>THE following Poem was writ with an Intention to do what
Service I could to my Country at this Conjuncture; which, as
Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> has truly obſerved, is a Duty incumbent upon the
Muſes Friend.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0664700400:7"/>
               <l>THE Muſes Friend unto himſelf ſevere,</l>
               <l>With ſilent Pity looks on all that err.</l>
               <l>But if a great, a publick Action ſhines,</l>
               <l>That he rewards with his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Immortal Lines.</l>
               <l>Whether it be in Council or in Fight,</l>
               <l>His Countries Honour is his chief Delight:</l>
               <l>Praiſe of great Acts he ſcatters as a Seed,</l>
               <l>Which may the like in coming Ages breed.</l>
            </q>
            <p>THIS is certain, that the late King delivered us from a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plorable
State. Now we who were once in a condition to want
Deliverer, may hereafter be in ſuch a Condition again; for who
has happened may happen. But ſince, as Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> obſerves
moſt Heroes are incited to the noble Acts they perform by a De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire
of Praiſe, who will be at the Trouble to ſave or defend
People ſo ingrateful as to refuſe them that?</p>
            <p>I DESIRE that the Reader would take two Cautions along
with him: The one that he would not interpret that Love of Libe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
which will be found in the following Poem, for an Averſion
Monarchy; for Liberty is as conſiſtent with the Government
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0664700400:8"/>
of One as with that of a Thouſand. The other is, that he
would by no means miſtake the Reflexions upon the Army which
he <hi>Dutch</hi> had in 1672. for a Satyr upon the Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
For I have a long time known the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant,
a Wiſe and a Great People, and their Country to be one
of the ſtrongeſt Bulwarks of the Liberties of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF any one happens to wonder that I have employed ſo many
Verſes in deſcribing the Battel of <hi>Seneffe,</hi> without dwelling
afterwards upon any other of the Glorious Actions of the King,
as the Battel of <hi>Mons,</hi> or that of the <hi>Boyn,</hi> or the Siege of
<hi>Namur:</hi> I deſire him to conſider that in Deſcriptions of all
Fights, there is ſomething reſembling; and by conſequence, that
one ſuch Deſcription for ſo ſhort a work is enough; and that
from among all the Actions of the King I choſe the Battel of
<hi>Seneffe,</hi> becauſe of the Brave Army oppoſed to Him, and
the Great Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> who headed them; and becauſe
it is the greateſt of all the Actions in which the King, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
any other Captain ever has been engaged; and above all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
becauſe the Succeſs of the Allies was undeniably due to the King's
Valour and Conduct.</p>
            <p>THE following Poem was writ with a Deſign of ſhowing the
King and not my ſelf, and written in the Language not of the
Head but the Heart. 'Tis written in Blank Verſe, and not
in Ryme, not only becauſe I thought that the former would
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0664700400:9"/>
give me the more Liberty, but for ſeveral other Reaſons which
will offer themſelves immediately to all who are Judges of Poetry,
and which ſignify nothing to the reſt. I will only put the
Reader in mind that Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> looked upon Ryme as a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and my Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> as a
Barbarity. Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> tells us in his Preface to <hi>Paradiſe
loſt,</hi> that Ryme is trivial to Judicious Ears, and of no true
Muſical Delight; and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in his Verſes before the
Eſſay upon tranſlated Verſe, that Poetry flouriſhed in <hi>Greece</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Till barbarous Nations and more barbarous Times,</l>
                  <l>Debas'd the Majeſty of Verſe to Rymes.</l>
               </q>
Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> threw it off in Dramatick Poetry, as Mr. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
had done in Heroick, and as my Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi> would
have done, if he had lived to write any more; of which the
following Lines in the Eſſay upon tranſlated Verſe, may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſatisfy us.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>OF many Faults Ryme is perhaps the Cauſe,</l>
               <l>Too true to Ryme we ſlight more uſeful Laws;</l>
               <l>For that in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> was never known,</l>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0664700400:11"/>
FROM what has been ſaid it is plain, that three of our Poets,
who have been deſervedly celebrated for the Fineneſs of their
Ears, have condemned and exploded Ryme, not only as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Art, and a Clog to Genius, and a Debaſer of the Majeſty
of Verſe; but as a thing of barbarous Sound, and contrary to
true Muſical Delight. And I am confident, that thoſe three
Gentlemen, if they had been alive, would have been pleaſed to
have ſeen in the following Poem, an attempt to ſecond that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Deſign, which the firſt of them began, and which the
two others approved of; a Deſign to ſhake off a barbarous Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and to ſhew the Harmony of our Mother Tongue (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Vulgar received Opinion) above that of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
the <hi>French,</hi> which is utterly incapable of producing
any thing like Poetical Muſick without the aſſiſtance of Ryme.</p>
