            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>BY <hi>Margelina Scribelinda Macularia.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>AS there are ſo many Impoſtors and Imitators Abroad, it is highly requiſite the Public ſhould be ſatisfied, that this is the true and genuine <hi>Dunciad</hi> of Mrs. <hi>Mary Midnight;</hi> to which End I have wrote this ſhort Preface. The Reader, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is deſir'd to attend to me with a little Patience, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon this great and wonderful Work. The extenſive Fame our Author has gain'd, by her <hi>learned Lucubrations,</hi> in all the <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Univerſities</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> has excited many (who have, by ſome Means or other, met with ſome of her Fragments) to vend among them their Heaps of Traſh in her Name; but it is hop'd the World will do her the Juſtice, to think ſhe is not the Author of ſuch poor paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wiſhy, waſhy, ſhim-ſham Performances.</p>
            <p>To reward, among many others, the Authors of ſuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a Manner due to their Deſerts, Mrs. <hi>Midnight</hi> has deſign'd and executed this Work; but, as an Affair of ſo much Conſequence could not but get Air in the World, ſeveral of theſe, who were conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of their Guilt, applied to her to <hi>be excus'd a Place;</hi> or, in other Words, <hi>to be left out</hi> of her <hi>Dunciad:</hi> Among which came the celebrated <hi>Pentweazle,</hi> and meanly offer'd her <hi>five Guineas</hi> in part, on Subſcription to her Miſcellany of Poems, to be publiſh'd ſome Time in <hi>February</hi> next. But Mrs. <hi>Midnight</hi> being above any mercenary View, was deaf to all Overtures, however conſiderable, of this kind: Upon which, with their uſual Aſſurance, her Enemies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd even this intended Work, <hi>the Old Woman's Dunciad,</hi> in her's and in my Name, intending to impoſe ſome Trumpery or other on the World, before this Poem could appear; and, with the moſt conſummate Impudence, put out Advertiſements againſt the fictitious
<pb facs="tcp:0170903700:3"/>
Imitators of Mrs. <hi>Midnight's</hi> Works, to out-face, if poſſible, the very Truth itſelf. But we have, thro' a ſurpriſing Quickneſs of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, peculiar to our Author, anticipated their Deſigns, to their utter Confuſion: Since the World will, by reading the following Work, be convinc'd of the genuine and elevated Spirit of Mrs. <hi>Midnight,</hi> and will not, for the future, be ſo eaſily impos'd on. I ſhall juſt add a Word or two on our Author's Character in general, and on this Work in particular. As to Mrs. <hi>Midnight's</hi> Reputation as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, notwithſtanding ſhe has made herſelf known but lately under that Name, yet it has been very extenſive, under the more general one of <hi>Old Woman;</hi> ſhe having had the principal Hand in moſt of the Performances that have been wrote within theſe few Years paſt; all which have been infallibly known by the Critics, who upon Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of them, have immediately laid them down, and crying out, <hi>the Author's</hi> an <hi>Old Woman;</hi> intimating thereby their Knowledge of her Works, and her eſtabliſh'd Reputation that rais'd them above Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. As to this Poem in particular, the Publick can never enough acknowledge the Obligations they owe her, in theſe Improvements of our Language; which, however, fall vaſtly ſhort of what ſhe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to do, having ſelected ſeveral thouſands of the moſt curious and copious in the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Eulogium on the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue. <hi>Cambria</hi> Book II.
