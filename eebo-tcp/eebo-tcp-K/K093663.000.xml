            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0961900100:39"/>
their faces are groteſque and ſavage, and ſtrongly marked with the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian caſt of features: On the right hand of Bacchus are two fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures attendant upon him; one of theſe is naked, and ſits at his back, leaning on one elbow, and in the other hand holding a narrow-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed drinking glaſs with wide lips; the other is in ſtrong ſhade in the fore-ground, his face turned from the ſpectator, in a crouching attitude, embracing a large earthen amphora, which ſtands on the ground; both theſe figures are crowned with wreaths of vine; and the God, who has a mantle looſely thrown over his waiſt, has his whole head covered with a large cluſter of broad vine leaves,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0961900100:40"/>
in a grand and pictureſque ſtile: His countenance is ſtrongly charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Mooriſh or Andaluſian caſt, with a broad noſe, full lips, wide mouth, and black ſparkling eyes: The figures are of the ſize of life. A very capital compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

                  <p>This is his celebrated picture, which the king has covered with a magnificent plate of glaſs: It was painted at Rome, and ſent from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0961900100:47"/>
thence to Madrid. In the perſon of one of the Shepherds, the artiſt has introduced his own pourtrait: The whole is laboured with amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care and ſtudy, and very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly coloured: His miniature-edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is conſpicuous in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and the Infant is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diminutive and delicate: The ſubject perhaps precludes origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and it does not ſeem to be attempted. It is ſcarce neceſſary to add, that this picture is a great court-favourite; all the works of <hi>Mengs</hi> are generally extolled in Spain, and this the moſt: I have obſerved, however, that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of mankind at large, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his rank in the liſt of artiſts, run much into oppoſite extremes;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0961900100:48"/>
and this is generally the fate which eminent men experience in the judgment of their contemporaries: This does not ſeem to proceed from any want of preſent capacity to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the degrees of merit in men, before Time has pronounced upon them with more authority, but is rather owing to the good and evil paſſions of mankind, to their lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and their antipathies, to an affectation of ſingularity, and a vanity to be thought a leader in taſte, and a diſcoverer of latent merit; ſurpriſed by theſe motives into ſudden applauſe, we commit ourſelves to it with a warmth which, though it frequently cools, we dare not diſavow, and thus become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0961900100:77"/>
too long: Surely this is a very trivial remark, to fall from the pen of ſo great authority, and, trivial as it is, there is great reaſon to doubt if it is founded in truth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, if the painter has enlarged upon the actual height of Peſcara's lances for the purpoſe of effect, who would expect that any eminent critic, after pronouncing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition faultleſs in every noble part, would ſeriouſly ſtate this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark as a ſingle exception? Let us therefore admit, with <hi>Mengs,</hi> that <hi>Velaſquez</hi> has taken a wrong mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Peſcara's lances; but at the ſame time let us take his word for the perfection of the picture in every other reſpect.

                  <p>This picture, like the <hi>Laſt Supper</hi> of <hi>Titian</hi> in the Refectory of the Eſcorial, is the ſtandard work of its maſter.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0961900100:92"/>
ſtrikes on the Angel, who is attending for his conſolation: The manner in which this emanation is reflected and diffuſed through the piece to the extremities of the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, and the exquiſite gradations obſerved in its diſtribution, are in the higheſt degree characteriſtic of the maſter. <hi>Mengs</hi> remarks, that Chriſt and the Miniſtering Angel are the only figures which meet the eye upon a firſt view; a cloſer examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brings forward many other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and much beautiful ſcenery. This is truly obſerved; for the Troop that come to ſeize our Saviour, the Apoſtles ſtanding aloof under the ſhade of Trees, the Foliage of the Grove, the Herbage of the Garden, a Crown of Thorns, a Croſs fixt in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0961900100:93"/>

I conceive to be a picture of great beauty, majeſty and effect; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is full and finely diſpoſed; the characters ſublime and majeſtic, marked with ſtriking diſcrimination and contraſt: The architecture is ſuperb; the colouring clear and of a moſt captivating brilliancy: The character of Chriſt is divinely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and of matchleſs beauty. The picture is of large ſize, and a moſt capital performance of the maſter.</p>

               <p>I have now gone through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of this noble collection; and, as I have reaſon to think it is the only correct and entire account yet
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0961900100:109"/>
publiſhed, I hope it will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the curious reader. Mengs's remarks only go to a few pictures, and the account of them in the <hi>Viage de Eſpan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a,</hi> by <hi>Don Antonio Ponz,</hi> is very far from perfect, though it is a work otherwiſe replete with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting information; and, as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral directory to travellers in Spain, no book can be better contrived.</p>
               <p>If the lovers of the art are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to analyze this account, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the reſpective works of the ſeveral great maſters, they will find it to be a vaſt collection, which the Spaniſh monarchs Charles V. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip II. III. and IV. amaſſed within the periods of their reigns: And if we add to this the great collection in the Eſcorial, that of the Buen-Retiro,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0961900100:110"/>
the many fine pictures which were burnt in the Pardo, and ſome of the moſt capital which have been diſcarded in the preſent reign, the amount will appear prodigious, and, I apprehend, is not to be equalled by any other ſingle collection in Europe.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Titian, Velaſquez, Rubens, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillo</hi> and <hi>Spagnolet,</hi> I find above one hundred and forty pictures in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Catalogue; forty-three of which are by the hand of <hi>Titian:</hi> I muſt take the liberty notwithſtanding to ſuggeſt that this collection would ſtill allow of many draughts to be made; and if theſe vacancies were filled up from the Buen-Retiro only (not to mention the Eſcorial) it would be much more perfect.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0961900100:111"/>
Some of <hi>Luca Jordano</hi>'s pictures might well be ſpared; <hi>Corrado</hi>'s ſketches, the pourtraits of <hi>Vanlo</hi> and <hi>Ynza,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Mengs</hi>'s inferior performances, would be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for a ſelect number of <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi>'s from the old Palace, for a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital <hi>Lucretia</hi> by <hi>Guido,</hi> which hangs there in obſcurity, and many others that might be named.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be regretted, that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſquez</hi>'s famous picture of Jacob re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the bloody Coat of his Son Joſeph, and a very fine <hi>Guercino</hi> on the ſubject of Suſanna and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, both which now hang in a wretched hole in the Eſcorial, not appropriated to any ſacred uſes, ſhould not be removed from thence, and added to the royal collection.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0961900100:112"/>
Advantageous changes might alſo be made in the arrangement of the pictures; for in the quarter belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prince and Princeſs many capital pictures of <hi>Raphael, Corregio, Leonardo de Vinci, Julio Romano, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Sacchi, Andrea del Sarto,</hi> and others, are very unfavourably hung; the chamber in which the principal pieces are, being a mean obſcure room, filled with lumber, and not in the ſuite of great apartments: The maſters are claſſed, in general, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſcientific attention to their ſtiles of colouring; ſo that the florid pictures oftentimes brow-beat the more tender; and the cold, laboured regularity of Mengs ill contraſts the warm and glowing canvaſſes of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Rubens,</hi> and <hi>Velaſquez.</hi> But if
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0961900100:113"/>
this remark holds good againſt the ſorting of the pictures in this palace, how much more to be lamented is the condition of the capital pictures in the Eſcorial, where the inimitable <hi>Perla</hi> of <hi>Raphael,</hi> the Holy Family of <hi>Andrea del Sarto,</hi> and the famous <hi>Tintorett</hi> of Chriſt waſhing his Diſciples' Feet, hang aloft in duſt and darkneſs over the preſſes that contain the Reliques in the Sacriſty, and are almoſt totally out of ſight. This muſt be painful to every lover of the art, but to the Engliſh tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller more than any, who will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally caſt a look of pity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards theſe intereſting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, once in the poſſeſſion of an elegant and unhappy monarch, who left them as monuments of his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0961900100:114"/>
taſte, to be alienated from his crown and nation by an unfeeling crew of fanatics, as barbarous as they were bloody.</p>
               <p>It is to be regretted, that ſo few engravings have been taken from the capital pictures in Spain; I procured all that were to be had, and the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is very ſmall: Two more may be ſoon expected by the hand of <hi>Zelma,</hi> an eminent artiſt; viz. of the <hi>Paſmo de Sicilia</hi> and the <hi>Perla:</hi> The <hi>

and protection from the royal owner of the collection. Several pictures might be pointed out in this Catalogue, and elſewhere, which would be admirable ſubjects, and raiſe the credit of our artiſts, already ſo high in eſtimation: At the ſame time that I venture to recommend this undertaking, I am not without ſome grounds to hope that it is in contemplation.</p>
               <p>I ſhould here take notice, that in the above Catalogue no account is taken of the pictures in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Infants Don Gabriel; Don Antonio and Don Luis: In the former there are ſix Sacred Hiſtories by <hi>Luca Jordano,</hi> from paſſages in the Life of the Virgin Mary; alſo an Abſalom, and a ſmall ſketch by

In the apartments late appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to Don Luis we find the copies which <hi>Rubens</hi> made of <hi>Titian</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous pictures of the Cupids and Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanals above deſcribed, and which <hi>Mengs</hi> ſo tauntingly compared to a Dutch tranſlation: There are ſeveral others of the ſame maſter, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a Saint George ſlaying the Dragon, of the ſize of life, coloured with ſurpriſing brilliancy, but in a gaudy ſtile and flattering. Amongſt the works of <hi>Rubens</hi> there is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes, a Mercury, Hercules kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Hydra, Apollo and Pan, and two pourtraits of Ladies of the Houſe of Medici, with ſome ſketches; two pourtraits by <hi>Vandyke,</hi> one very capital of the Infant Don Ferdinand.

               </p>
               <p>Having mentioned ſome pictures caſt out of the royal collection, which I ſaw in the cuſtody of an artiſt belonging to the king, it may be proper to obſerve, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of five capital <hi>Titians;</hi> the firſt of which is his ineſtimable <hi>Venus,</hi> once the property of King Charles I. of England, deſcribed in the <hi>Anecdotes</hi> (<hi>vol. i. p.</hi> 56.) the greateſt model of beauty and perfection in the world: 2. A <hi>Venus and Cupid,</hi> with a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the back-ground playing on
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0961900100:119"/>
an Organ, the Venus recumbent on a couch: 3. A <hi>Venus</hi> of the ſame ſize, attitude, &amp;c. with the addition of a little Dog, which ſhe is careſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: 4. A <hi>Venus</hi> in the action of holding back <hi>Adonis</hi> in her embrace, who is ſetting out for the chace with his dogs, &amp;c. 5.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0961900100:120"/>
the attitudes perhaps have more of the academy than might be wiſhed, the colouring warmer than his uſual hue. Of <hi>Rubens</hi> there are ſeveral, and ſuch as would dignify the firſt collections in Europe; viz. <hi>The Rape of the Sabines; The Baths of Diana;</hi> a <hi>Bacchanalian Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,</hi> wherein ſeveral Bacchants are plucking fruits, and the figure of Bacchus himſelf in a capital ſtile; a <hi>Perſeus and Andromeda,</hi> which is a wonderful picture; a group of <hi>Juno, Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Venus; Paris carrying away Helen,</hi> capital; and <hi>The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris,</hi> with the Rival God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, a matchleſs piece of colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; all of the ſize of life, and the very beſt of the maſter. There are

alſo two beautiful pictures by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bano;</hi> one of them <hi>The Judgment of Paris;</hi> the other a <hi>Venus</hi> coming out of the Bath; and a <hi>Lot and his Daughters,</hi> by <hi>Andrea del Sarto.</hi> I need not obſerve what an acceſſion theſe ineſtimable pictures might be to the collection in the palace.</p>
               <p>The royal chapel of the palace is a very beautiful piece of archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, ſupported by vaſt columns of Biſcayan black and white marble, each of one entire block; and in the ſacriſty and chaplain's room there are ſeveral fine pictures by <hi>Spagnolet, Murillo, Luca Jordano, Corrado, Cambiaſo, Alonzo Cano,</hi> and other Spaniſh maſters; beſides which there is a Deſcent from the Croſs, by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
