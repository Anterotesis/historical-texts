            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN the Poſthumous Pieces of any Author have for ſome Years
lain in Obſcurity, and at laſt come into the World, the Publiſher, for
his own Reputation, is obliged to ſatisfy the Publick, that they are the
genuine Productions of that Pen to which his Title Page pretends to aſcribe
them.</p>
            <p>THAT theſe MEMOIRS may fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Suſpicions of being
ſpurious, it is neceſſary that I ſhould account for <pb facs="tcp:0319800400:4"/> their
coming into my Poſſeſſion. When I was laſt Year in <hi>Paris,</hi> it
was my good Fortune to contract ſome Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with a younger Son of Sir
<hi>Richard Bulſtrode,</hi> who then reſided there, as Governour in the
Family of the young Earl of <hi>Fingal.</hi> I had not long enjoy'd the Honour
of his Converſation, before he frankly gave me the Copy of theſe MEMOIRS,
with free Liberty to make them publick to the World, and aſſured me they
were all wrote by the Hand of Sir <hi>Richard</hi> his Father. The Town is
therefore indebted to this Gentleman's Generoſity, and are to look upon me as
an Agent that labours to be faithful in acquitting my ſelf of a Charge
intruſted to me.</p>
            <p>I SHOULD have thought it a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Piece of Juſtice, to
have made a Character of Sir <hi>Richard Bulſtrode</hi> a Part of this
Preface, but find all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite on this Head is already done by
<hi>Whitlock Bulſtrode,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> likewiſe a Son of the
Author, and who has obliged the Publick with a Volume of his Father's 
<pb facs="tcp:0319800400:5"/> Eſſays, Printed in <hi>Octavo</hi> in the Year 1715, where the
Reader may be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a preliminary Account, how well Sir
<hi>Richard</hi> was qualify'd both for an Author and Stateſman.</p>
            <p>IF theſe Sheets could ſtand in need of any other Proof of
their being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, than the Aſſertion I have given from whoſe Hands I
received them, I could not deſire a ſtronger concurring Teſtimony than
thoſe Eſſays. Every Judge, who will do himſelf the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a
Compariſon, will find both thoſe and the MEMOIRS penn'd in the ſame
Style, and with the ſame Caſt of Thought and Spirit of Language. The
Contents being Matter of Fact, they ſhould neither be partial, nor of a
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet if ſome will think he reflects too ſeverely, let them
conſider he wrote at a Time when Faction and Presbytery had undone his Royal
Maſter, and left a very poor Proſpect of the Kingdom it ſelf eſcaping
from their Rancour.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is natural for all Men, when ſtreightened with Fears, to run
for Shelter to what their Fancy preſents as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Eaſe
and Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but he that hath Time to deliberate, unleſs he places his Hopes
upon ſomething that is like to eaſe his Pain, by making his Afflictions
leſs, or his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0319800400:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> more, deſerves that
Miſery he groans under: But Afflictions which come by God's Appointment,
repreſent the Sadneſs of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and become Monuments of Mens Piety and
Devotion. In the unnatural War, which the Subjects of King <hi>Charles</hi> I.
began againſt their moſt lawful Sovereign, contrary to all Solemnies of
Chriſtianity, and of all that is called Good, I was then very young, and in a
Labyrinth, not knowing well which Way to go; but at laſt I reſolved to go
to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with ſome Gentlemen of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then newly come thither from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I had been bred,
in <hi>Pembroke-Hall.</hi> I was brought up to <hi>London</hi> by my Father,
from <hi>Coventry,</hi> where we then dwelt: We were all brought into the
King's Preſence by the Lord Chamberlain, and had the Honour to kiſs the
King's Hands, who took our Coming very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at the ſame time told us,
he hoped he ſhould have no need of our Service.</p>
            <p>About this Time, the King, and the Laws, (who by God and Man
reſpectively are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſole Protectors of Innocence and Truth) had
themſelves, I thought, the greateſt need of a Protector; and when I
conſider'd our King's Caſe, in the Beginning of his Troubles, me-thought it
was much like to that of King <hi>David,</hi> who was vexed with a Civil War,
both by his Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and by his own People: But the Caſe of
our King was worſe than that of King <hi>David</hi>; for the Text ſays, his
Enemies kept about him <hi>like Bees,</hi> and were extinct; there was 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0319800400:24"/> ſome Honey with them; but our King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies came about
him like Hornets, where there was all Sting, and no Honey. And indeed the
King's Caſe was rather like that of <hi>Iſaac</hi> ready to be
ſacrificed; the Wood was prepared, the Fire kindled, the Knife was lift up,
and the Hand was ſtriking; and if the King's loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had not been
ſomething like <hi>Abraham</hi> too, having, out of Hope, believed in Hope,
we had been as much without Comfort, as we were in outward Appearance without
Remedy. Indeed I then ſaw ſuch unparallel'd Revolutions in our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, as I hope will never be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and will be
ſcarce credited in After-Ages; whereupon I have thought it worth my Time to
give ſome Account of thoſe great and ſtrange Tranſactions, wherein I
was perſonally engag'd, which are ſtill freſh in my Memory, having
faithfully ſerved King <hi>Charles</hi> I. from the Year 1640, which Civil
War ended not till 1648, in the moſt deplorable Murder of the beſt of
Kings, whoſe Cauſe at laſt God ſo owned, and ſo vindicated his
Honour, that never Prince was more truly lamented, nor his Poſterity, by
divine Providence, more wonderfully re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, without the
Aſſiſtance of any foreign Power, tho' his rebellious Subjects uſed all
poſſible Diligence, (which either Wit or Malice could invent) to extirpate
the Royal Family, both Root and Branch.</p>
            <p>I preſume, the Duty of my publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments abroad, under
King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and King <hi>James</hi> II. will in ſome Meaſure
plead my Excuſe <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0319800400:25"/> for giving ſome Relations of the War of
King <hi>Charles</hi> I. which have not yet been mention'd, and of thoſe
ſudden Changes, and violent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions happen'd in the laſt Age; and
being now grown old to all worldly Pleaſures, after many long and faithful
Services to the Crown, and being wholly unacquainted with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of
Riches, or with the Cares of increaſing them, or the Fears of loſing them,
and finding little Taſte in common Converſation, I have ſpent my latter
Years in writing ſome Memoirs, Poems, and other Diſcourſes, to ſhew
that I have not ſpent my laſt Days in Idleneſs and Vanity; and that
ſince I can no longer live in an active Life, I may not die an unprofitable
Servant. And yet I have but ſmall Inclination to write, when the Number of
Scribblers in this laſt Age hath given the World a Surfeit, by the
miſchievous Liberty of Writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great Advantage hath been taken, to
corrupt People with falſe Notions of Government, which hath deſtroyed
Millions of Men, by engaging them in ſuch a Rebellion, as no Age or Nation
can equal, under Pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Law: And tho' at firſt it did not
break out into Blood, but was carried on for ſome time with Paper
Skirmiſhes, yet at laſt it grew too ſtrong for both; and according to the
uſual Practice, when any Rebellion was hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they that deſigned it,
immediately cry'd out, <hi>Hannibal ad Portas,</hi> and that what they did, was
to preſerve their Religion, Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Properties, when none of
them were <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0319800400:26"/> in Danger; and when they moſt flattered their
Sovereign, and called God to witneſs the Purity of their Intentions, even
then they were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Weapons to murder him. And as it is ſeen in
natural Bodies, that Fatneſs of Diet doth for the moſt Part lay the
Foundation of Maladies, which cannot be expell'd by the moſt ſkillful
Phyſician, without the Uſe of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Medicines; ſo, in our
Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, we were bleſs'd with long Peace, with Riches and Plenty the
Product of it, and by the propitious Influence of our King, when we thus
flouriſhed, we went only to throw away thoſe bleſſed Fruits of Peace,
ſo that the whole Body Politick was quickly out of Order: And tho' perhaps
there were ſome Errors and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities in the Government, yet they
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from any Pravity of Diſpoſition in the King, nor from any
Principles of Arbitrary Government; it being confeſſed by the King's
greateſt Enemies, that he was indued with the beſt and pureſt Morals, of
any Prince that ever held the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter. But his People
thought that ſome evil Counſellours did capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate him at their Pleaſure,
and did thruſt his Majeſty into Actions prejudicial to himſelf and the
common Good; upon which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by that rebellious Parliament to
take Arms, under the plauſible Shew of Reformation and Liberty, when many of
them, in the Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Hearts, never had the leaſt Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
abridging the King of any of his juſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, but only to reſtrain
ſome Exceſſes in <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0319800400:27"/> Government, which they really
thought were the Excreſcences of ſovereign Power, and were rather Burthens
than Ornaments of his royal Diadem. Indeed his very Example would have had a
greater Influence upon his Subjects, than the ſtricteſt Laws. He was ſo
great a Lover of Juſtice, and ſo great a Juſticiar himſelf, that no
Temptations could diſpoſe him to a wrongful Action, unleſs it were ſo
diſguiſed to him, that he believed it to be juſt; and yet I cannot but
confeſs, that a Prince's Fame, in this World, depends more upon his wiſe
Adminiſtration, than upon his private Morality and good Life. The Goodneſs
of his Government depends chiefly upon thoſe that adviſe him, who are to
yield unto their Prince all the Reputation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from their good
Counſels, and never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the Honour of them from the King: It being
an infallible Maxim, That he is not the worſt King, that is the worſt Man,
but he who hath the worſt Counſellours and Inſtruments under him.</p>

obnoxious to be arraigned and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, being in the King's Confidence, and
in the Head of his Affairs, theſe ſhould have been pitched upon to anſwer
criminally for all thoſe things which were then called Miſcarriages; the
Law having mark'd them out as Offenders, and as Offerings of Attonement for the
King's Faults (were he guilty of any) but inſtead of this, the King (whom all
the Laws of the Land, and the Conſtitution it ſelf, hold not only
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhable, <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0319800400:28"/> but innocent) was elected as the
Scape-Goat, to have the Offences of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the ſubordinate
Tools of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tranſmitted and laid upon him.</p>
            <p>Thus Rebels are never without ſome Pretext to palliate their
Actions; and rather than fail, will make their Vizard of Religion, which (if
true) is a Setler, not a Stickler in Government: She confirms Men in Obedience,
and does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in Rebellion. It is a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake indeed, to
think Peace is well enough preſerved, if the Sword be not drawn, and think it
not War, becauſe we do not take the Field; whereas, we may as well call it
Health, when there is a dangerous Fermentation in the Blood, becauſe the
Patient hath not taken his Bed: For certainly, where there is not a firm
Truſt between the King and his People, from a due Obedience to his Laws and
Government, and a ſteady Care not to remove the ancient Landmarks, not to
diſturb thoſe Conſtitutions, which the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors hath
ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in order to preſerve the whole Frame of the Government upon the
old Foundations: When any of theſe fail, the Kingdom muſt needs fall into
Confuſion, as was miſerably ſeen in the Time of this unhappy Prince.</p>
            <p>But, to find the Beginning of theſe Evils, we muſt look back
as far as Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where we ſhall diſcover the
Presbyterians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving what they have ſince put in Execution, to the
eternal Scandal of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. Their Religion hath always
been imperious, <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0319800400:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> turbulent, and bloody, and hath
embroil'd all Places with Rebellion, where it once got Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from its
firſt Riſe at <hi>Geneva,</hi> to its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move into <hi>France,</hi> from
thence into <hi>Holland,</hi> ſo into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence to
its Arrival in <hi>England.</hi> They are impatient of any kind of Government;
Theocracy it ſelf would not pleaſe them, for they conclude againſt all
Governments. From their firſt Inſtitution, they ſhewed their Hatred
againſt Monarchs, and they ſtill glory to have had a principal Part in
moſt of the Commotions of Chriſtendom, ſince they took up the Work of
Reformation; and by their frequent Inſurrections in <hi>England,</hi> they
gave the firſt Occaſion of ſaying, <hi>Rex Angliae, Rex Diabolorum.</hi>
The reſt of Schiſmaticks are but their Spawn; <hi>Calvin</hi> firſt
founded his Preſbytery and Treaſon: For when they at <hi>Geneva</hi> had,
in his Abſence, expell'd their lawful Prince, he not only encourag'd, but
confirm'd what they had done, at his Return. Preſbytery never was received
into any State, where it did not embroil; never any Man was poſſeſſed
with it, whom it did not ſtrangely transform with Moroſeneſs; all their
Writings are ſtuff'd with reproachful Language againſt the ſacred
Perſons of Princes, with Dethroning Principles, and King-killing Doctrines,
as may be ſeen in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> in that of
<hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> in <hi>Vindiciae contra Tyrannos,</hi> written by
<hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi>'s <hi>Appellation to the People,</hi> and
<hi>Buchanan</hi>'s <hi>Jus Regni apud Scotos,</hi> which he had the Impudence
to dedicate to King <hi>James</hi>; <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0319800400:30"/> in which Book, and
others of their Writings, they ſay, The People are the Original of all juſt
Power, and that wicked Kings, for their Miſgovernment, may be put to Death by
their Subjects: An impious Principle! juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and fitted only for
the Mouth of a <hi>Ravilliac.</hi> Hiſtory tells us, that, in the Reigns of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the
Preſbyterians were always grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and murmuring againſt the Times, their
whole Practice being to deprive God of his Glory, the Prince of his Honour, and
the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Senſes, affirming the Condition of <hi>England</hi> was
miſerable. In the Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Pulſe of the
People began to beat high (by the Inſtigation of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians)
towards an Ariſtocratical Government, under a Kingly Title, and the malicious
Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church and State did then begin to appear; but that watchful
Queen was ſoon alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and ſo aſſerted her Prerogative, that ſhe
kept all in their Duty: She declared, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted publickly, that no
Trouble ſhould arrive to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, for any Difference in
Religion (which did much abate the Oppoſition which might poſſibly have
been made by them) hoping for fair Quarter under her Government. She knew well,
that a King or Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> how ſovereign ſoever, could not
eſtabliſh a new Religion in their Kingdom, without the Authority and
Countenance of a Parliament; and therefore, to win the Biſhops, and the
reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in Parliament, at <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0319800400:31"/>
leaſt to Obedience, ſhe was content to uſe Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with them, and would
qualify the Style of Supreme Head of the Church and State, to that of Supreme
Governour, which, tho' it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd not the Senſe, yet it abuſed many into a
Belief or Conceit, that the Queen pretended not ſo much Primacy
Eccleſiaſtick as the King her Father had done, who was the firſt King of
<hi>England</hi> that ever gave Cauſe to try the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Patience and
Obedience of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Subjects, who took not Arms againſt their
Sovereign, and had no other Weapons but <hi>Praeces &amp; Lachrymae,</hi> the
Prayers and Tears of the Church for their Refuge.</p>
            <p>Indeed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was ſo careful, that the
Parliament could make no Impreſſion upon her Sovereignty; and tho' the Cry
of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was pretty loud, and that the Enemies of Church and State
were troubleſome to her, yet, by her conſtant Reſolution, ſhe was not
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne by any Faction; and finding it eaſier to crop them in the Bud,
than to pull them up by the Roots, ſhe took the right Courſe with them, by
putting the Schiſmaticks under the Statute of Recuſancy, equal with the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, whereby ſhe quieted All; and often declared in
Parliament, That both Houſes had only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to adviſe and conſent to
what they thought was for the common Good and Benefit of her Subjects: And
wherever the Prince is not jealous of Underminers, and active to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the eſtabliſh'd Government, there will never want Spirits to attempt a
Change, and <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0319800400:32"/> make Religion a Shelter for their Rebellion.
It is certain, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have always loved thoſe Princes beſt,
who grounded their Power in the Affections of their People, who ruled them by
their old Laws, and uſed ſuch moderate Power, as was conſiſtent with
their Government, rather than ſuch as aim'd at any Change, which might tend
to ſubvert their ancient Conſtitution; and ſeldom any Prince hath
miſcarried, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly purſued the publick Good, and directed all
his Counſels to his Country's Eaſe; but thoſe Princes have been full of
diſaſtrous Troubles, who have obſtinately adhered to a Few, againſt the
Whole, and have conferred that Affection to particular Perſons, which
ſhould be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the univerſal Body of the People.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, the Excellency of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
Government was, that, at her firſt Coming to the Crown, ſhe found a Council
of able Miniſters (which in the laſt Age were not ſeen) which ſhe
continued, who managed the publick Affairs with ſuch prudent Conduct, that
their Counſels and Actions, as they were either Gown or Sword Men, gave great
Satisfaction, and had great Influence upon the whole Nation. But her
Succeſſor, King <hi>James,</hi> was not ſo wary, who came to the Crown
under many Difficulties; for, the Mixture of a Stranger Nation, formerly upon
no good Terms with <hi>England,</hi> the Subjection of it to a Stranger Prince,
whoſe Nature and Diſpoſition being unknown, could not but prove of very
ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, who let that ill Humour in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0319800400:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> imbibe ſo faſt, that it ſoon bred in them a
violent Contumacy againſt the Prerogative: And this King <hi>James</hi>
minding his Pleaſures more than his Buſineſs, his Favourites were more
eſteemed than his Stateſmen; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon permitted his Favourite
<hi>Scotchmen</hi> (coming out of a poor mountainous Country, into a rich Soil)
to make a Harveſt of the Crown Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; and when handſom Mr.
<hi>Villiers</hi> was brought into Favour (for Handſomneſs went a great Way
in our Court) he came ſuddenly to have ſo prodigious an Aſcent upon the
King, that he entirely diſpoſed of all his Favours, and did whatever he
pleas'd.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of this King's Government, the King had no great
Choice of excellent Men; and Mr. <hi>Villiers</hi>'s Aſcent was ſo quick,
that it ſeem'd rather a Flight than a Growth; and he was ſuch a Darling of
Fortune, as if he had been born a Favourite, being Supreme the firſt Month he
came to Court. However, he was very unfortunate in the Election of his
Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, few of his Servants being qualified enough to adviſe him, and
were intent only of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich under him, and not upon their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
being as Good as Great. And if this great Favourite had been ſo happy as to
have had but one faithful Friend, that Perſon might have done great Service
to both his Maſters, even to Father and Son. In King <hi>James</hi> the
Father's Time, he took the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi>
contrary to the King's Opinion, who yet ſubmitted to him; and upon a
particular <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0319800400:34"/> Diſcontent of his own, broke the intended
Marriage, and brought back the Prince, to the great Satisfaction both of King
and People; which Action was ſo highly approved in the laſt Parliament of
that King, that the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> was called, The Saviour of the
People; and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> then Ambaſſador at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> was recalled, and Articles exhibited againſt him by the
Duke, and by his Intereſt was kept out of the Houſe of Lords. Now all that
happen'd in <hi>Spain</hi> is here very well worth relating, which I have had
from a very ſure Hand, which hath been kept private from many.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was employ'd Ambaſſador in
<hi>Spain</hi> by King <hi>James,</hi> to treat of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the then
<hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> being zealous
for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, inſiſted to procure ſome
Favours for the <hi>Engliſh Roman</hi> Catholicks, which related no farther,
than to a Freedom of Religion for the <hi>Infanta,</hi> her Servants, and the
Children of the Marriage, and her Eccleſiaſticks and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, which
could not be done, without the King's particular Licence and Diſpenſation;
to which the King aſſented. But this Affair being longer delayed, the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> King urged farther, in Favour of the <hi>Engliſh
Roman</hi> Catholicks in general (but the Manner and Way of doing it, was to be
left to his Majeſty's Wiſdom:) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon King <hi>James</hi> and Prince
<hi>Charles</hi> both ſigned; and King <hi>James,</hi> for farther
Satisfaction, did, by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> his then Secretary of State,
dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. 1623. declare and engage, <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0319800400:35"/> That his
ſaid Majeſty would cauſe a preſent Suſpenſion, under the Great Seal
of <hi>England,</hi> of all thoſe penal Laws whereunto his <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Subjects were before ſubject, and under the ſame Great Seal would
give a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and Toleration to all his <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Subjects, as well Prieſts as temporal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Marriage not taking
Effect, and Animoſities happening betwixt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Earl, before King <hi>James</hi>'s
Death having been impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Parliament; yet he wrought ſo with the
Houſe of Commons, as to impeach the Duke, who then prevailed with his
preſent Majeſty, that the Impeachment of the Earl ſhould be firſt try'd
in the ſame Parliament, thereby to cauſe the Earl to forbear Proſecution
of his Charge againſt the Duke, or to invalidate his Teſtimony. One of the
Articles charged againſt the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was, <hi>That he
counſelled and perſwaded King</hi> James, <hi>to grant and allow the
Papiſts free Toleration, and ſilencing all Laws made againſt them.</hi>
But the Earl poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this Article, and ſaid, it was only
decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That he would diſpenſe with the Laws, which imported no more
than a Permiſſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Religion in private Houſes, and to
ſuſpend the Execution of the Laws againſt them for a time; all which the
King had Power to do:</hi> But to grant a free Toleration, imports an
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of publick Worſhip, and the ſilencing all Laws againſt them,
might import a total Repeal, <hi>which the King did not claim a Right</hi> 
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0319800400:36"/> 
               <hi>to do himſelf.</hi> When the Impeachment was brought
into the Lords Houſe, the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> did put in his Anſwer
to it, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denied, that he had counſelled any thing in the
Matter charged, and declared fully what was done, and what was ſigned by the
late King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi>; as alſo the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> by the King's Order; and added, <hi>That the
Duke of</hi> Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham <hi>being then the greateſt Miniſter of State, and
Favourite to King</hi> James, <hi>did adviſe all things in the Affair: That
the Lord</hi> Conway <hi>certainly ſigned the Declaration.</hi> The Earl
wanted neither Wit nor Courage to charge the Duke with Crimes as
diſtaſteful as he could find any; and he ſpared not the Lord
<hi>Conway,</hi> who was the Duke's Friend, and muſt have been the beſt
Witneſs to ſave the Duke, in caſe the Charge had been proſecuted. The
Parliament then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was as diligent to enquire into Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, as
much diſpleaſed with the Duke, and as little fond of the Lord
<hi>Conway,</hi> then Secretary of State, and were as much enclined to enquire
into the too much advancing or ſtretching the King's Prerogative, to the
Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Subject, and againſt the Laws, as any Parliament which ever
ſat in <hi>England. Yet neither did the Parliament, or the Earl of</hi>
Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, <hi>charge any thing againſt the Duke, or the Lord</hi> Conway,
<hi>for adviſing to diſpenſe with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws, nor did the Parliament
proſecute the Earl of</hi> Briſtol <hi>upon the Impeachment againſt
him,</hi> tho' he was thereby particularly charged <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0319800400:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for adviſing the King to diſpenſe with the Penal Laws. <hi>Now, if
King</hi> James <hi>and King</hi> Charles I. <hi>did paſs any Act of
Parliament (as ſome affirm) to bar themſelves or the Crown of this Right,
the ſame could be only intended as to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Exerciſe of that
Right,</hi> but not to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, where the publick Good requires the
ſame ſhould be exerciſed. The King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings were to be thus
intended, and not otherwiſe, which was proved by the King's continual
Exerciſe of that Power, in the Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Penal Laws, never
queſtioned or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, but ſtill ſubmitted unto, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as
legal; <hi>as namely, thoſe touching the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of</hi> French
<hi>Wines:</hi> And it was clear by his Majeſty's Practice for many Years,
that he thought it both reaſonable and legal, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the
Diſpenſations by which his Majeſty ſuſpended many Laws, without any
Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>About this Time a War was declared with <hi>Spain,</hi> which was
carried on by the violent Humour of the Duke, whoſe Power was ſo great,
that he govern'd all without a Rival; which Preheminence he managed very
unthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, diſpoſing of all Places to his own Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where there
was no Advantage or Profit to be had. <hi>This Partiality ſhewed the Duke's
Weakneſs, and was much unbecoming the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the King his Maſter,
whoſe Honour ſhould ſhine upon the whole Body of his People, as the Sun
ſheds his Influence, warming all Parts of the Earth.</hi> And where Kings
ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0319800400:38"/> partial to a Party, they are
uſually ſerved by the worſt of the People, and are often forced to
protect the Bad againſt the Good, as we have often ſeen in our late
Revolutions: Not that Subjects repine, that Princes ſhould have Friends with
whom they may communicate their Thoughts, and unbend their Cares, nor to ſee
ſuch better'd by their Favours, which is warranted by the Example of the
beſt of Kings, who muſt ſometimes recreate themſelves, and not be
always upon their Thrones, which would too much weary them. Greatneſs muſt
be ſet aſide ſometimes, the better to be reliſhed: But Subjects do
behold with Indignation, Men to be exalted, who abuſe their Prince's Favours,
and by falſe Repreſentations, traduce all others, that they may ingroſs
the Prince to themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Regard to the King's Honour, when their
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Advantage or Safety is in Queſtion. Such Miniſters are
generally hated, and the People commonly reach their Heads at laſt. Wiſe
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould never protect ſuch Miniſters; for when Princes bring
Projectors into the Adminiſtration of their Affairs, who are Inventers of new
Taxes, they bring an Odium upon their Maſter; and the Ignorance of ſuch Men
brings more Neceſſities upon the Prince, than their Arts of raiſing
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney can ſupply. None but wanting Princes employ ſuch Men, who
ſometimes can ſkin over a Sore, which after breaks out with greater
Rancour: Whereas wiſe Stateſmen would, by wholeſom Counſel, obviate the
Danger in its Growth, and reſtrain their King's extravagant 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0319800400:39"/> Bounty, before he hath nothing left to give: For the
Bounty of a Prince often frights Men from meddling in their Affairs. I know,
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince, it being much better for
him to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, than avaritious, Prodigality having the Reſemblance of
ſomething more noble, than Avarice, and really it is leſs odious; and they
that gain by it, make it paſs for a Virtue, but perhaps it is more
prejudicial to Poſterity, and no leſs dangerous than the other Extreme. For
if a King give away his whole Kingdom, he cannot ſatisfy all that aſk, no,
nor all that think they deſerve much from him. It is then more convenient to
give with Reaſon, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to draw ſo near the Bottom, but that Princes
may always have wherewith to gratify Perſons of Merit; and above all, they
ſhould take eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Care, that their Liberality be exerciſed without
Oppreſſion of their People, to avoid Murmuring, which may produce
Rebellion. Wiſe Kings ſhould never give, till their Coffers are full; for
the Meaſures of Bounty ought to be taken from the Plenty of the Giver, as
well as the Merit of the Receiver: And Kings ſeldom hurt themſelves by
giving what is actually in their Keeping, for Reward of particular Merit, but
giving things they never had (as King <hi>James</hi> I. actually did to his
Favourites) of which they know not the Value, is the Ruin of Princes
Treaſure, and conſequently of their Affairs. For the Neceſſities of
wanting Princes make them repeat Taxes, which loſes them the 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0319800400:40"/> Affection of their Subjects; and Thrift hath ever been
eſteemed a Point of good Wiſdom in Kings, who ſhould ſtand firm
againſt all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Suits, ſo that no Caſe, upon what Grace ſoever,
may break the Rule; for if one ſtrong Sheep breaks the Hedge, a Hundred
little ones will follow: And therefore the firſt thing a King ſhould learn
to ſay, is <hi>No,</hi> and that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, as never to be aſked
twice, nor once importunately: For one extravagant Gift to one, raiſes the
Market to every Man elſe; and the unlimited Bounty of a wanting Prince, makes
him a Beggar, tho' he have a vaſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: And that Prince, who will give
more to Importunity than Merit, may as reaſonably forbid his Subjects doing
well, upon Penalty of being undone by it. Where Princes give, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they
are importun'd, and where the leſs uſeful Part of the People have moſt
Credit with their King, this ſhews, the Way to get every thing, is to be good
for nothing; and tho' the ſervile Part of Mankind are apt to extol, not only
generous Princes, but thoſe that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; yet if we conſider the
Story of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, we ſhall find their Decadence took its
Riſe principally from this profuſe Temper, and that their Prodigality drove
them to Want, and made them oppreſs, and become odious to their People, by
their frequent Taxes. But we need not now make Laws againſt giving too much,
Princes are not ſo free in this Age, and we want no Overſeer of that kind,
in our Court, at <hi>St. Germaine</hi>'s, where we live upon Alms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0319800400:41"/>The good Emperor, <hi>Marcus Aurelius
Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in his Nature very bountiful, having given the People a larger
Donative than uſual, was yet ſo frugal of the publick Money, that, upon an
Expedition againſt the <hi>Scythians,</hi> he would not draw any Sum from the
Treaſury, without firſt aſking Leave of the Senate, affirming that he had
nothing in particular, and not ſo much as the Houſe he lived in. And being
another Time preſſed by his Army, for a Donative, after a ſignal Victory,
he refuſed it, ſaying, <hi>The more I give the young Soldiers, the more I
muſt oppreſs their Parents.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> well
anſwer'd one of their Emperors demanding double Taxes: <hi>O Emperor, if thou
wilt have double Taxes, we muſt have double Harveſts.</hi> Kings are
Fathers of their Country, but unleſs they keep their own Eſtates, they are
ſuch Fathers as the Sons maintain, which is againſt the Order of Nature,
and the leſs a Father depends upon his Children, the more he is certainly
reſpected.</p>
            <p>The Love of Subjects is not obtained by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but by wiſe
Government, and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and all People, even Soldiers, reverence their
Prince more, who keeps ſomething in his Power to give, than he who gives all
away; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and Hope carrying Men farther than the Senſe of paſt or
preſent Benefits, and good Princes deſire to make their People eaſy. King
<hi>Charles</hi> I. of <hi>England</hi> never refuſed to eaſe his People of
any Grievance, and paſſed more Acts of Grace for the Benefit of his
Subjects, than <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0319800400:42"/> any five Kings or Queens had done before
him. He granted an Act of Triennial Parliament, and the perpetuating of them,
was an Act unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd by any of his Predeceſſors: And good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſhould never think it juſt, that the King's Condition ſhould be worſe,
by bettering theirs. But our good King counted himſelf undimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by his
largeſt Conceſſions, thinking by them to gain the Love of his People,
being perſwaded he could not grant too much, nor diſtruſt too little, to
Men that being profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Subjects, pretended ſingular Piety, and
religious Strictneſs. But our King was much miſtaken, for no Fountain of
Royal Bounty was able to ſatisfy their <hi>Corban</hi> of Religion: And it is
ſure, had that good King yielded leſs, he had been oppoſed leſs; and
had he denied more, he had been more obeyed. Princes ſhould therefore take
Care of running with the Stream; for, chuſing a crooked Courſe, for fear of
the Torrent, is not commonly very dangerous.</p>
            <p>The Honour of a King conſiſts chiefly in doing good to the
univerſal Body of his People, which good <hi>Charles</hi> aim'd at, there
being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo glorious for a Prince, as to let his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enjoy Eaſe
and Plenty, and not to enrich a few Perſons with the Spoils of a whole
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> ſaid, he hoped ſo to order
Matters, that every Man in his Kingdom might have a boil'd Capon for his
Dinner. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, no Apothegm, ſo much by the Ancients commended, could
ſo well become the Mouth <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0319800400:43"/> of a great King, as this
well-natur'd Saying; and it is probable, had he lived, he would have made good
his Word, which would have been a more durable Triumph to his Fame, than all
his great Victories; and his Example, who, by his Frugality, brought the Crown
of <hi>France</hi> out of Debt, is to be preferred to that of <hi>Henry</hi>
III. of <hi>France,</hi> who haraſſed his whole Kingdom, to build up four
or five great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whereby he left behind him ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
Monuments of his Folly and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And our King <hi>James</hi> I. followed
the Meaſures of <hi>Henry</hi> III. in his moſt extravagant Bounties, which
cauſed the then Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to put upon a long Table, where the King
was to paſs by that Morning, a large Sum of Money in Silver, which the King
had given to one of his Favourites the Night before: The King being much
ſurprized with the Sight, (having never ſeen ſo much Money before
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) aſked the Treaſurer, who was behind him, what that Money was
for? who ſaid, it was for ſuch a Perſon, naming him to whom the King had
given it: To which the King preſently replied (with his uſual Oath) it was
much more than any Man could deſerve from him, and commanded the Treaſurer
to pay him only one Quarter of it. This made the King more careful of his
future Bounties; tho' I may truly ſay, that this King (tho' to his own
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice) had more Compaſſion of other Mens Neceſſities, than of his
own Coffers; for, in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, he exceeded, by many Degrees, all the 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0319800400:44"/> Kings that ever went before him: And it had been much
better for King <hi>Charles,</hi> his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, if his Liberality had not
been ſo great; for by that means, he left his Succeſſor much indebted,
which prov'd infinitely prejudicial both to the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now, whoſoever hath read King <hi>James</hi>'s Works, will find
therein moſt rational and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Diſcourſes of the Nature of
Government, and the good Temper of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, where there
is no unnatural Swelling of Power, nor Liberty; for theſe two are like Heat
and Moiſture, where they are well mix'd, every thing proſpers, but where
they are ſingle, they are deſtructive; and our true lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in
<hi>England</hi> is like our Climate, where there are ſometimes unquiet loud
Winds, which, tho' troubleſome, yet they clear the Air, and much of Mens
Healths is owing to them. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power is a Plant that will not grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ground; thoſe who have attempted to cultivate it in that
Soil, have haſtned their own Ruine. All Men muſt confeſs, that King
<hi>James</hi>'s Diſcourſes in Parliaments were admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the
practical Part was wanting; for his remiſs and looſe Government was a great
Cauſe of our following Diſorders: For, finding no Money could be raiſed,
to ſupply his Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and extravagant Bounties, but by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he therefore ſtill careſſed them, thinking that Way to prevent the ill
Humour, which lay in the Stomach of the Nation, which then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhew it
ſelf more publickly; and he <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0319800400:45"/> would often ſay, he was
but One King, that, in his Houſe of Commons, were near Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and
whilſt he liv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Preſbyterian Subjects ſo much
teazed, and ſo often impriſoned him, that he had as good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt been one
of the Kings of <hi>Brentford,</hi> as King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> However, this
King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thoſe Dominions which he had by an undiſputed
Succeſſion, coveted nothing more from his Neighbours, nor had other
Thoughts or Wiſhes, beſides thoſe of the common Peace and Repoſe of
Chriſtendom, and had therefore a juſt Motto given to his Arms, <hi>Beati
Pacifici.</hi> He had ſo much Cunning, that he ſtill held well with his
Parliaments, and deſired to be beloved, rather than feared by them: For
Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without Love, hath a terrifying Aſpect, and the Worſhip paid to it,
is like that which the <hi>Indians</hi> give, out of Fear, to wild Beaſts and
Devils. And as he that fears God, only becauſe he is Almighty, wiſhes there
was no God; ſo he that fears the King, only becauſe he can puniſh,
wiſhes there was no King; and therefore a King cannot take too much Care to
keep himſelf up: For if a King lets his People ſlip from him, he is no
longer really their King, but the People may let a King fall, and ſtill
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a People.</p>
            <p>In this Conjuncture, after Twenty Two Years peaceably reigning in
<hi>England,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> I. died, leaving his Son, then King
<hi>Charles,</hi> his Succeſſor, ingag'd in a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> by
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Parliament, without Supplies to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0319800400:46"/> it,
and left his own Debts great, by his immoderate Bounty; to which a great
Addition was made, upon King <hi>Charles</hi>'s coming firſt to the Crown,
and many Inconveniencies were then ſubmitted to, for Supply, contrary to
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Laws; and Miſcarriages in Government eſcaped in the Beginning of
this King's Reign, which happened thro' the ill Counſel of ſome Men,
driving on their own private Ends, and the Peeviſhneſs of ſome others,
envying the Publick ſhould be managed without them, join'd with the
inſuperable Neceſſities of State, rather than from any Propenſity in
the King, who was free from any Injuriouſneſs, or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his
People.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was at this time received into an
admired Intimacy and Dearneſs by the King, and a Marriage was ſoon
conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and
the Duke was ſent thither to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to the King. A little after this a
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was called, the Houſe of Commons, upon their firſt
Aſſembly, preſſed for Redreſs of Grievances, and againſt
Recuſants, and they gave the King two Subſidies, which did not anſwer his
Wants and Expectations, nor at all ſatisfy; and the King finding the
Parliament more ſtiff than he expected, he ſoon diſſolved them; that
ſowre Humour againſt Kingly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative being then very predominant in the
Houſe of Commons; and the Duke, who, in the laſt Parliament of King
<hi>James,</hi> was ſtiled, The Saviour of the People, in bringing Home 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0319800400:47"/> the then Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> was now called, The
Deſtroyer of the People, and more cry'd down, than he was before cry'd up,
and was named, the Corrupter of the King, and principal Cauſe of all
Diſorder, who had betrayed the Subjects Liberties, and his ill Management was
made the Pretext for not aſſiſting the King in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the State
of the King's Affairs then required; who uſed all poſſible Means to
ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a diſcontented People, but could not. The late Parliament, before
their Diſſolution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the King had ſent Ships into
<hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> King againſt his
Proteſtant Subjects at <hi>Rochel,</hi> which was by the Duke's Intereſt,
without acquainting the Council of State, which much exaſperated the People,
who complain'd, that the Duke had not made the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> out
of a particular Spleen againſt the <hi>Conde d'Olivares,</hi> and had made it
with <hi>France,</hi> upon much harder Terms.</p>
            <p>The Duke being hereupon queſtioned in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, made a
plauſible Anſwer: However, the Houſe of Commons reſolved againſt any
farther Supply (except the two Subſidies they had given) without Redreſs of
Grievances. After the Diſſolution of this firſt Parliament, ſome
proviſional Acts of State were made, to ſupply the Defects in Law, and a
Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was publiſhed againſt Catholicks, to give the People ſome
Satisfaction, and a Fleet was ſent out by the Duke againſt <hi>Cadiz,</hi>
but retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ill Succeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0319800400:48"/>In <hi>February</hi> following, a ſecond
Parliament was called, and the King was ſoon after crowned. The Lord Keeper
then made a Speech to the Parliament, declaring the King's Love to them,
ſtriving whether he ſhould be a greater King, or a better Man; and that
they were called to make good Laws, and execute Juſtice. The Houſe of
Commons preſently fell upon Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, the Miſcarriage of the
<hi>Cadiz</hi> Voyage, the Miſemployment of the King's Revenue, and reflected
much upon the Duke, and ſeveral bold Speeches were made againſt him, and
great Animoſities ſtill continued betwixt the Duke and the Earl of
<hi>Briſtol.</hi> The King demands of the Parliament a preſent Supply, and
deſired they would rather redreſs, than inquire into Grievances. The
Houſe of Commons exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Articles againſt the Duke, deſiring he might
have no more Acceſs to the King, and agreed upon a Remonſtrance againſt
the Duke, and pray'd the King not to diſſolve them. The Duke being much
tranſported with this Uſage, prevailed with the King to diſſolve them,
and fell into ſuch Anger againſt ſome principal Members, that they were
impriſoned or diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſoon after Diſſolution. From this time the
People were generally apprehenſive of an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government, and were much
unſatisfied with the exceſſive Greatneſs of the Duke, who had a greater
Aſcendant upon his new Maſter, the preſent King, than upon his
Predeceſſor; which was much wondred at, that the ſame Perſon ſhould
be the prime Favourite both to <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0319800400:49"/> Father and Son, which bred
a great Diſtemper of Humours in the Court, which ſoon deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the
Country, and the Diſpleaſure to the Favourite ſoon ſeized their Duty to
their Prince. Kings raiſe ſome Men ſo high, as to over-top All, and keep
them under; but it is dangerous to beſtow too much upon one Man, for there is
no Man fitting to be a King, but he that is a King; and when Kings are
immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in beſtowing their Power, it many times brings much Woe to the
People, much Danger to the Perſon in Power, and not ſeldom, much Sorrow to
the King himſelf: And a wiſe Prince will not oblige his Courtiers, who are
Birds of Prey, to diſoblige his Subjects, who are Beaſts of Burthen. It was
indeed look'd upon as a rare Felicity, and ſeldom known, that the Duke
ſhould be in greater Favour with the Son, than he was with the Father: For,
the new King, from the Death of the old King, even to the Death of the Duke
himſelf, diſcover'd the moſt entire Confidence, and even Friendſhip, to
the Duke, that ever King ſhewed to any Subject; all Preferments were given by
him; all his Friends and Kindred to that Degree in Honour, Riches, or Offices,
as the Duke thought fit; all his Enemies diſcountenanced, as he appointed:
But it was ſtrange, that he ſhould ſo ſuddenly fall, from the
greateſt Heighth of popular Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to the loweſt Depth of Calumny
and Reproach, by perſwading the King to diſſolve Parliaments, which
proved moſt pernicious to the Duke himſelf; for, in the firſt Parliament 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0319800400:50"/> of this King, tho' moſt of the ſame Perſons were
choſen, who ſo paſſionately adhered to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Affection they
had then for him, even of the ſame Men, was turned into Animoſity againſt
him, and that in ſo high a Nature, that all the Actions of his Life were ript
up, Votes and Remonſtrances paſſed againſt him, as an Enemy to the
Publick, and his ill managing of the King's Grace and Favour to him, made the
Ground of their Refuſal to give the King that Supply which he expected, and
was highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the King, in that Conjuncture. Here all the
People's Diſcontents were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duke, in reſpect of the mighty
Share he had in his Majeſty's Favour and Affection, and that he managed his
Power, to the Eclipſe of all other great Men, and moulded the Court to the
Advantage principally of his own Family, thinking thereby to ſtrengthen
himſelf (inſtead of endeavouring to mollify the Miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
betwixt the King and his People, which was his true Intereſt:) But the Duke's
Want of Experience, having never ſeen or felt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of Fortune, made
him too great an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizer, to ſucceed in what he ſo unadviſedly
undertook, and ſo precipitately, and for his own Satisfaction; and, upon his
ſingle Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, firſt ran the late King into a War with
<hi>Spain,</hi> which proved both fruitleſs and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome to him. And
thus the Throne was endanger'd by him, whoſe Obligation and true Intereſt
it was to uphold it; and King <hi>Charles</hi> did not only ſucceed to his
Royal Father's <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0319800400:51"/> Crown, but Troubles, who was left involved
in moſt ſtrange Intrigues and Difficulties, the Counſels of his
Miniſters being not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted according to thoſe Rules and Meaſures
of Policy, which the Circumſtances and Neceſſities of the King's Affairs
required; which, if they had been well managed, had eaſily prevented the
cruel Rebellion which afterwards followed.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee Princes cannot be ſecure, when leading Men in
their own Courts fall into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and when there is moſt need of Concord
and Unity, Mens Minds are then moſt diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and, contrary to ancient
Prudence, when <hi>England</hi> wanted the beſt, the worſt Men were ſet
at the Head of Buſineſs; and our then moſt unhappy King, was, by
Diverſity of Counſels, drawn oftentimes from his own Judgment, (which was
better than theirs) and was forced many times to court thoſe he hated, and to
frown upon thoſe, whoſe Abilities and faithful Services to the Crown he
ſecretly approved; which is uſually the Fate of ſuch Princes who are
drawn into Streights, either by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, or their own
Negligence; and at this time the greateſt Part of the King's Counſel where
wholly taken up in the Improvement of their own Fortunes, or Gratification of
their Pleaſures which they earneſtly affected, and had ſo much to do for
themſelves, that they wholly neglected the King's Affairs, and thoſe which
were moſt able, were frighted from meddling in them; and when thoſe
Miniſters, whoſe Steadineſs of Judgment, and Directneſs 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0319800400:52"/> of Application to their Maſter's and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's
Honour and Advantage, eſtrange them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Court, it abates Mens
Confidence in the ſucceſsful Courſe of Affairs.</p>
            <p>The King being put to theſe Streights, Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Pondage were
levied by Order from the Board, and likewiſe Loan Money and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
taken; and the Duke finding the King ſomewhat unſatisfied with the
<hi>French</hi> King, and that the Queen's Servants were ſending Home, his
Grace ſoon changed the Scene, and cauſed the King to declare War againſt
<hi>France,</hi> and went in Perſon to the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> to
aſſiſt the <hi>Rochellers</hi> againſt their King; but he was there
defeated, and this Repulſe was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate than that of <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
But, in <hi>March</hi> following, another Parliament was call'd, and the King
ſpake to them, to expedite Buſineſs, ſhewed them the common Danger,
moved for a Supply, and told them plainly, if they did not do their Duty, he
ſhould be obliged to uſe other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which would not be ſo
pleaſing to them: But however, the Houſe of Commons fell upon Grievances,
before Supply, and after many Debates, and ſome Conferences, the Petition of
Right was ſetled by Act of Parliament, and ſeveral other Acts paſſed,
and then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was prorogued till <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Interval the Duke reſolved upon a ſecond Attempt
againſt <hi>France,</hi> and was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for it at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi>
but was prevented by his ſudden Murder, which gave the King much Sorrow and
Trouble: And as the Duke, during <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0319800400:53"/> Life, was unfortunate in
publick Affairs, ſo his ſudden Death produced a Change in all Counſels;
it being firſt generally agreed, that the King ſhould make a Peace with
both Crowns, ſince the War could not be carried on without Supplies, and the
Parliament was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prorogued, till <hi>January,</hi> which was ill taken.
And Kings of <hi>England</hi> will never do well, to fence with the
Inclinations of their Parliaments, or Diſcontents of their People; they
muſt ſhew they have no other Intereſts, but thoſe of their Subjects in
general; for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in a Prince produces Heart-Burnings, to ſee ſome
few lifted up high, wallowing in Wealth and Pleaſures, while the People groan
under heavy Taxes. A Government is never well eſtabliſh'd but in the Hearts
of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor ſo hard to be ſhaken, as when the Generality of the
People, as well as the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are intirely ſatisfied; which they will
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be, till they ſee Men choſen into Offices, by being fit for them,
and continued for diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging well, and rewarded for extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and puniſhed for remarkable Faults. In ſuch Caſes, the King diſcharges
the Severity of all Puniſhments upon the Parliament, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no Force
upon the Gentleneſs of his own Nature, when his Subjects ſee, that no
Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of their Prince, nor Corruption of his Miniſters, can
preſerve them from paying what they owe to any Forfeits of their Duty; nor
indeed can any Prince do Juſtice to thoſe that ſerve him well, without
puniſhing thoſe that <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0319800400:54"/> ſerve him ill, ſince that is
to make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions equal, whoſe Deſerts are different. And therefore
Kings ſhould not only conſent to, but encourage any Inquiries a Parliament
ſhall make into the Miſcarriages of Miniſters, and join willingly with
them therein: But whether, at that Time that the Parliament would have
queſtioned the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> they did then proceed from a
ſteady Intention of a general Good, or from ſome particular Animoſities
againſt the Duke, or from ſome accidental Diſtempers, from which the
greateſt and beſt Aſſemblies are not always free, is ſtill a great
Queſtion; eſpecially when ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies have continued long
together: For then they will ſpy out, and look after Miſcarriages and
Grievances, rather than ſupply their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King and Sovereign. 'Tis
certainly true, when Kings of <hi>England</hi> meet often with their
Parliaments, and agree with them, they may command what they pleaſe: But if a
King's Revenue be ſuch, as to enable him to live without his Parliament, he
will be more free; for the Meeting and long Sitting of Parliaments is
dangerous; for uſually, when publick Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ended (nay, many times
before they have ended it) they fall upon Grievances, and enter into Factions,
to the great Prejudice of both King and Kingdom (as hath been often ſeen) and
therefore <hi>Poſning</hi>'s Law was a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt long
Sitting of Parliaments. However, when Parliaments reſolve to go upon
Grievances, Kings ſhould never interpoſe, to <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0319800400:55"/> ſecure
their Favourites from anſwering Crimes which are alledged againſt them in
Parliament, as was intended againſt the Duke, before the Parliament was
prorogued; for it lays an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon the Prince, as being privy to their
Actions, and fixes alſo a Scandal upon the Perſon accuſed, that he is
generally thought guilty of all things laid to his Charge. And this Courſe,
which was taken in the Beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Government, of
Proroguing and Diſſolving Parliaments, rendred the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Power more formidable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was thought
unlimited; and tho' he was eſteemed but as an Idol ſet up by King
<hi>James,</hi> and was therefore more contemptible to the People; yet, at the
ſame time, they thought the preſent King ſtood in Awe of him, and was
afraid to pull down that Favourite, who was grown ſo formidable by his Power,
and the Number of his Followers and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but ſuch top-heavy Buildings,
which have no ſolid Foundation in them, of Merit, are ſoon blown down; and
let bad Men have never ſo much ſeeming Greatneſs and Power, they are
ſeldom dangerous to wiſe Princes, who will never hinder them from being
brought to Puniſhment, by a timely Sacrifice; and no Man ever yet ſaw a
Tumult to defend them. And if this great Favourite, the Duke, had not been ſo
ſoon murdered, he had certainly been made a Victim to the Publick, by the
Parliament. And when this Parliament met in <hi>January,</hi> they were very
troubleſome, fell upon Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0319800400:56"/> and made ſome
Aſſaults againſt the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and were preparing ſome
Accuſations againſt the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton:</hi> And tho' the
King ſent the Black Rod for the Commons, to come to the Houſe of Lords,
they locked the Door of their Houſe, and not only refuſed Entrance to the
Black Rod, but forced the Speaker to his Chair, till they had adjourned the
Houſe to a Day, thinking thereby not to be diſſolved before the Day of
their Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. However, the King went in Perſon to the Houſe of Lords,
without calling the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and diſſolved the Parliament, affirming, that
ſome Vipers in the Houſe of Commons, were the Cauſe of his diſſolving
them, and at the ſame time very much courted and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Lords; and,
after this Diſſolution, ſome of thoſe Members who had carried
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very inſolently, were committed to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Priſons, and
the King, to ſatisfy his People, publiſhed a Proclamation, ſhewing the
Cauſes of diſſolving thoſe three Parliaments.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1630, Prince <hi>Charles</hi> was born, at whoſe
Birth great Rejoicing was thro' the whole Kingdom; and in 1633, the King went
to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was there Crowned with great Solemnity. At his
Return, in 1634, Ship-Money was raiſed with great Care and Equality, by
Letters written from the Privy-Council to every High-Sheriff; and tho' this
Pill was gilded, it would not be ſwallowed, but great Diſcontents were
expreſs'd at an Impoſition never before practiſed, and againſt Law: But
yet this was <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0319800400:57"/> done by the Advice and ſolemn Agreement of
all the Judges, (except two, <hi>Hatton</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi>) who argued
againſt it. However, they ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the King's doing it; neither
did the Judges do ſo much in this, as was done in the Parliament of 31
<hi>H.</hi> VIII. when it was agreed, that the Legiſlative Power ſhould be
in the King and his Council, in Intervals of Parliament; and that the King's
Proclamation ſhould be of equal Force with an Act of Parliament: And this was
thought fit by the Parliament, as being a dangerous thing, that the King
ſhould be at Diſadvantage, for Want of Power, in Caſe of ſudden
Exigencies. And therefore there was Reaſon, that the King ſhould ſteer
with a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rudder, that his Care might meet with every Turn of
Providence, which might otherwiſe ſuddenly overturn the good Government of
the Nation: And it was then alſo declared in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that if the Motions
at home ſhould wait upon the Debates in Parliament, things muſt needs come
ſhort in Execution, and the Affairs of the Nation extremely ſuffer. And
tho' this was but a temporary Law, during the then preſent Condition of
Affairs; yet, in the 34 and 35 of the ſame King, another Law was made to
confirm what was done before, with a Power granted to the King and Council, to
change and alter, as they ſhould think fit. And certainly the ſame Reaſon
held as ſtrong, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the troubleſome and impetuous Reign of King
<hi>Charles,</hi> tho' he thought not convenient to demand any ſuch Power.
<hi>The Opinion of</hi> 
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0319800400:58"/> 
               <hi>the Judges was ſubſcribed
in theſe Words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>We are of Opinion, that when the Good and Safety of the Kingdom in
general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in Danger, your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty may by
Writ, under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> command all your Subjects of
this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at their Charge, to provide and furniſh ſuch Number of
Ships, with Men, Victuals, and Ammunition, and for ſuch Time as your
Majeſty ſhall think fit, for the Defence and Safeguard of the Kingdom, from
ſuch Peril and Danger; and that, by the Law, your Majeſty may compel the
doing hereof; and, in Caſe of Refuſal, or Refractorineſs, we are alſo
of Opinion, that your Majeſty is the ſole Judge, both of the Danger, and
when and how the ſame is to be prevented and avoided.</q>
            <p>The King did nothing herein, but what he was adviſed to do by
his Judges, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteemed the King's learned Council in the Law;
and if any thing was amiſs in this Particular, the Adviſers were to
anſwer for it, which they did, and ſome of them were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
puniſhed for it: But whether they were puniſhed deſervedly, or not, is
yet a Queſtion. Soon after the King's Return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> Biſhop
<hi>Laud</hi> ſucceeded Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> in the See of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> who being very powerful with the King, adviſed the
Setling the Church Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it was in
<hi>England,</hi> that there might be an Uniformity of Church Diſcipline in
both Kingdoms; and the King <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0319800400:59"/> ſent down his Orders
accordingly, with a new Service Book of Common-Prayer, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be read
in all the Churches: But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and deſigning Men, who deſire
Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in State, do moſt commonly begin their firſt Attempt upon the
Church, as was ſeen in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by their Commotions upon this
Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when they were, at that time, by God's Mercy to us, and the King's
Care over us, in perfect Peace with all the Nations upon Earth. The King, by
the Marqueſs of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> his Commiſſioner, did all he could to
quiet thoſe Troubles; yet nothing would do, for the <hi>Scots</hi> made a
Covenant together, and declared never to renounce it, but prepared for War; and
from thence ſprung the true Fountain of all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Miſeries in
<hi>England.</hi> This kind of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government, which was then
eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had found good Reception in ſome of the
<hi>Gallican</hi> and <hi>Belgian</hi> Churches, and which <hi>Beza</hi> uſed
his utmoſt Endeavours to plant in <hi>England:</hi> But wary Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſtood fix'd, and could not be brought to any
Unſettlement of the ancient Diſcipline of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy: But in
<hi>Scotland</hi> this new Form proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by the Artifices of
<hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> and during King <hi>James</hi>'s Minority,
they threw down Biſhops, and ſetled Preſbytery, and uſed their King as
they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>About this Time, the ſhort Parliament of 1640 drew near; the
King being then at <hi>York,</hi> was preparing to return to <hi>London.</hi>
It was then conſidered, whether the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> 
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0319800400:60"/> ſhould ſtay with the Army, or go with the King to
<hi>London.</hi> The Earl ſhewed many ſubſtantial Reaſons for his not
going, and knowing how much the <hi>Scots</hi> were incenſed againſt him,
and how great an Intereſt they would have in the Parliament: That, by his
Abſence, he would not be ſo much in their Mind; and that if any thing
ſhould be objected againſt him, he might the better avoid, and retire from
any Danger, and be better able to do the King Service elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, when the
King's Occaſions ſhould require it (as he much feared they would;) but no
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments could prevail, but the King continued earneſt for his going with
him, and aſſured him in the Word of a King, if he ſhould be queſtioned,
he would ſo defend him, that a Hair of his Head ſhould not be touched; and
ſo the Earl reſolved to ſubmit to the King's Commands, tho' he foreſaw
his own Deſtruction in it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1640, the Parliament met, when
<hi>Glanville</hi> was choſen Speaker. A Meſſage was ſoon ſent by the
King to the Houſe of Commons, for Supplies, ſhewing the intolerable
Indignities and Injuries of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had not only common Ties of
Nature, Sovereignty, and Bounty upon that Nation, with his late royal Father,
but had twice gratified the active Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit among them ſo far, that he had
preferred the Deſires of that Party before his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Honour; and
his royal Bounty to them had emboldened them to aſk and act beyond all Bounds
of Modeſty and Gratitude, which made the King more ſcandalized at their
coming into <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0319800400:61"/> 
               <hi>England,</hi> contrary to his Will, and
with the Forfeiture of ſo many Obligations of Duty to him. It is true, that
when they firſt entered <hi>England,</hi> Succeſs crowned their Work, being
thought a wiſe and reſolute Nation, who, after an unbloody War, for above
one Year, returned laden with Spoils, and great Riches, and were moſt
liberally rewarded, as well for going out, as coming into <hi>England:</hi> But
God's Juſtice was in the End diſcovered through all their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
Religion, in which they wrapt up their wicked Deſigns, who built their Piety
upon the Ruines of Loyalty, and made Bankrupt of their Allegiance, to ſet up
a quicker Trade for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Upon this Account, the King (as he had good
Reaſon) was very angry with them, and declared, if the Houſe of Commons
would aſſiſt him ſuitable to the Exigency of his Affairs, he would not
only quit his Claim to Ship-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but would give them full Satisfaction in
all their juſt Demands; which Meſſage was much approved by both Houſes,
and many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were held, whether the Supply, or the Subjects Grievances
ſhould precede. The Lords voted for the firſt, but the Commons for the
latter; however, the Difference was ſoon unhappily decided by a voluntary
Miſtake in old Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> then Secretary of State, who was
ordered by the King and Council, to demand ſix Subſidies, and he demanded
twelve; which was ſo highly unreaſonable, that many were much
diſpleaſed, but all were inclined to have given ſix, which was no uſual
Gift.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0319800400:62"/>Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> eſcaped not without
great Cenſure, for demanding Double to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but it was really
believed, this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake was purpoſely done, to raiſe the Houſe to
Animoſities, which took Effect; for the Houſe would not conſent to what
he demanded, but inſiſted upon their Grievances, which made the King ſo
deſperate, that he forthwith diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Parliament. The Counſel
given to diſſolve them was generally diſliked, becauſe the Differences
between the King and this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament might have been cemented by the Lords,
and the <hi>Scots</hi> Troubles, by this Parliament, appeaſed, which grew
wider by this Breach; and the Odium of this was laid upon Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Laud,</hi> who was thought to be more buſy in temporal Matters, than he
ought; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too full of Fire (tho' a juſt, good Man) his too much Zeal
for the Church made him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King to the Sitting of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which ought not to have been done) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diſſolution of the Parliament.
The King then cauſed a Guard to be ſet about <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
while the Convocation ſat, who ſetled the Diſcipline of the Church, and
would not alter the Government by Biſhops, and they granted a Benevolence to
the King, of Four Shillings in the Pound, for ſix Years, towards his
Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> wherein the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was very
active. The <hi>Scots</hi> were at this time come into a warmer Climate than
their own, and Petitioned the King for Redreſs of their Grievances, in
ſeveral Articles. All good <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0319800400:63"/> Men inveighed ſufficiently
againſt them, whilſt others approved of their Proceedings. There was at
this time a ſtrange Spirit of Diviſion in the Opinions of Men, of theſe
Affairs; too many not only favouring, but joining with the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Covenanters, who preſented their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, How their Army ſhould be
maintained, till the Treaty was ended, and Peace ſecured; and ſo they had a
great Allowance: But the King's beſt Subjects ſaid, the King ſhould
rather have put All to the Iſſue of a Battle, than to give ſuch Terms to
moſt rebellious Subjects. But the King ſaw plainly, that divers Officers of
his own Army, and even the private Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had no Mind to fight againſt
the <hi>Scots,</hi> which made the King conclude the Treaty with them. The Earl
of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> who had great Alliances in <hi>Scotland,</hi> came then
into <hi>England,</hi> to ſerve the King, but by the Marqueſs of
<hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Cunning, (who betrayed the King in all the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Affairs) <hi>Montroſe</hi> was ſlighted and neglected, whereupon he went
back to the Covenanters; but being ſoon weary of them, he wrote to the King,
profeſſing his great Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Service to his Majeſty; which Letter
was taken out of the King's Pocket at Night, by the Marqueſs of
<hi>Hamilton,</hi> and ſent to the Covenanters.</p>
            <p>About this Time, a Reſolution was taken by the King and Council,
to call another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the great Neceſſity of the King's Affairs then
obliging him to it. The Court Party la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much to bring in their Friends,
but <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0319800400:64"/> thoſe that were moſt eſteemed at Court, had
leaſt Reſpect and Intereſt in the Country; and it was not a little
ſtrange to ſee, what a Spirit of Oppoſition was in the Hearts of moſt
Men, to the Court's Proceeding: So that very few of the King's Party were
choſen Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And indeed the higheſt Danger in
<hi>England</hi> comes from the Power of the People to elect their
Repreſentatives; for they will be ſuch as are of their own Complexion, and
which will ſtand by them in all their Deſigns againſt the Government, for
clipping the Wings of Monarchy, and reſtraining the King's lawful
Prerogative; which was the true Reaſon why the King broke ſo many
Parliaments; but at laſt being wearied, and overborne, he was
neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give Way to their Meeting in 1641, which, by ſeveral
Encroachments upon the Royal Prerogative, their long Sitting, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in
their Rebellion, brought their lawful Sovereign at laſt to the Block, as will
be ſeen in the Sequel of theſe <hi>Memoirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Long Parliament was convened to meet <hi>November</hi> 3.
1641. a moſt ominous Day! for the Parliament met that Day, in 20 <hi>H.</hi>
VIII. which began with the Fall of Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>; and therefore
Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was deſired to get their Meeting adjourned for
ſome Days: But the good Man took no Notice of thoſe things. At their
firſt Meeting, the King told them, he was reſolved to put himſelf freely
upon the Love and Affection of his Subjects, and left it intirely to them,
where to begin, <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0319800400:65"/> promiſing them Redreſs of Grievances,
and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that all Suſpicion of each other ſhould be laid aſide. The
Houſe of Commons, after eſtabliſhing Committees, fell upon Grievances,
and many ſharp Speeches were made upon that Subject. The King paſſed the
Bill for the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial Parliament, and thereby declared his great Confidence
in them, and the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Favour he did his Subjects, by paſſing that
Bill. The Houſe of Commons fell preſently upon the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> whom they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of High Treaſon, and deſired he
might be ſecured, which was done accordingly, and great Preparations made for
his Trial in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> before the Lords; and one of the
ſharpeſt Managers of the Evidence againſt his Lordſhip, ſays, That
<hi>No Man ever acted a Part on ſuch a Theatre with more Wiſdom,
Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and Conſtancy, and with greater Reaſon, Judgment and Temper,
and with a better Grace,</hi> than that great Lord and excellent Perſon did,
ſo that he moved the Hearts of all his Auditors (ſome few excepted) to
great Pity and Remorſe. His Lordſhip told them, it was hard that
Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhould precede Promulgation of a Law; to be puniſhed by a Law
ſubſequent to the Fact, was never heard of till that time; that there
ſhould no Mark be ſet, by which the Offence might be known, no
Admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to avoid it, was a Caſe extreme hard. The King heard
all the Tryal, and after went to the Houſe of Lords, and ſent for the
Commons, and did paſſionately deſire the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0319800400:66"/>
not to proceed ſeverely againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
aſſuring them in the Word of a Chriſtian, that he could not in
Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, and added, that neither Fear, nor any other
Reſpect, ſhould make him go againſt his Conſcience. However, the Bill
of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſſed both Houſes, and a Bill not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue, adjourn,
or diſſolve the Parliament, without Conſent of both Houſes. Thus, when
Men ſeek to limit and confine the King to their Reaſon, they muſt needs
have a ſecret Aim to ſhare with him, or uſurp upon him in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and
Dominion: For good Men in Parliament will propoſe nothing to their King, nor
expect any thing from their King, but what he will be as ready to give them, as
they are to receive from him.</p>
            <p>The King was much perplexed at the ſending to him theſe two
Bills, and ſent for ſome of his Biſhops, and others of his intimate
Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to have their Advice what Meaſures to take, who adviſed
him to paſs the Bills: And the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> being informed of
the King's great Perplexity, wrote to the King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to paſs the
Bill againſt him, ſaying, his Conſent would acquit the King before
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. Whereupon the King paſſed the Bill, and ſent Mr. Secretary
<hi>Carleton,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Earl with it, who not believing, without
ſome Aſtoniſhment, that the King would have paſſed the Bill, he
roſe from his Chair, and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, clapp'd his Hand upon
his Breaſt, and ſaid with ſome <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0319800400:67"/> Paſſion, <hi>Put
not your Truſt in Princes, nor in the Sons of Men, for there is no Truth in
them;</hi> which he had ſome Reaſon to ſay, becauſe the King had
engaged him to come to <hi>London,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own Sentiment, and had
faithfully aſſured him, in the Word of a King, that in Caſe he ſhould
be attack'd in Parliament, he would ſo defend him, that a Hair of his Head
ſhould not be touched. And now by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Meſſage, he had Notice
given him of his Death, to which he really believed the King would never have
conſented; which made him break out in that Expreſſion, with ſome more
than ordinary Movement, believing his Letter to the King would have made him
more firm in his Reſolution. Great Reflections were made upon the King's
paſſing theſe two Bills, the one againſt his moſt faithful Servant,
and the other againſt himſelf: The firſt took away the Life of that great
Stateſman, the other his own Life, both Bills being ſigned at the ſame
Time, and with the ſame Pen. The King had great Remorſe for what he had
done, and the next Day ſent a Letter to the Lords written with his own Hand,
by the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for the Earl's Life; but nothing
would prevail, tho' it was confidently affirmed by ſome, that the Earl's Life
was promiſed the King, to encourage him to paſs the Bill: But now the Lords
would not conſent to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Deſire. And thus fell this noble
Earl, who, for natural Parts and Abilities, for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Knowledge, by
Experience in <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0319800400:68"/> greateſt Affairs; for Wiſdom, Fidelity,
Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Gallantry, left no Equal behind him. A little after this, to
ſatisfy the King in ſomewhat, the Houſe of Commons granted an Act for
Tonnage and Pondage, which the King took before as due by his Prerogative, but
now as a Gift from his People.</p>
            <p>The Parliament then adjourned till Winter, it being thought fit
the King ſhould go into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the People there beginning to
ſhew their Diſcontents more publickly, where the King being in Perſon
might better redreſs their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, as they call'd them. The King then
granted every thing they deſired, without aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Queſtions, till
they declared they had no more to aſk, the King having entirely fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their Deſires, and (as the Phraſe then went) <hi>He parted, a contented
King, from a contented People.</hi> For, from the Time of the King's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
among them, he had fully complied with all they deſired, both for the publick
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their private Advancements. The Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
within it ſelf, enjoyed perfect Peace and Tranquillity, and the King was
confident, the Affections of the <hi>Scots</hi> could not be corrupted,
believing they were ſenſible of their former Breach of Duty, and willing to
repair it by any Service; and that their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>Leſly,</hi> had made
great Acknowledgments and Profeſſions of Duty to his Majeſty, and would
be always ready and willing to ſerve him. About the End of <hi>November</hi>
this Year, the King returned well ſatisfied from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was, 
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0319800400:69"/> upon his Arrival, moſt ſumptuouſly entertained by
the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King then went to the Parliament, and made a Speech to both
Houſes, wherein he told them, he made as much Haſte to them, as his Affairs
in <hi>Scotland</hi> permitted; and that he had left that Nation in a moſt
peaceable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Condition: And yet he was no ſooner gone from them,
but they ſubſcribed their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, raiſed an Army againſt their
lawful King, made <hi>Leſly</hi> their General, to join with their dear
Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> who were then hatching a Rebellion againſt
their King, who then told them in Parliament, That tho' he did not find
<hi>England</hi> ſo well ſetled as he expected, (being full of
Jealouſies, and Alarms of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Plots) yet he doubted not of his
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects good Affections, by his Reception at his Return: And added, That he
was ſo far from repenting what he had done for them, that he was willing and
ready to paſs any thing more, that might juſtly be deſired, for their
Liberties, Properties, and Maintenance of their Religion; and deſired them
not to be diſcontented at their own Happineſs, nor to be without Senſe of
their natural Allegiance: And that having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Opinion of being good
Patriots for their Country, they ſhould not be inveigled into Steps of
Diſloyalty, nor to uſe ſuch Meaſures as would diſturb the Throne. The
King alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them the Buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where,
it ſeems a Rebellion broke out, during his Abſence in <hi>Scotland</hi>;
and the King offered <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0319800400:70"/> to go thither in Perſon, to
proſecute thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, but the Parliament would not agree to it. Now, he
that governs three Kingdoms, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three ſeveral Nations, whoſe
Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Manners, and Language are different, and whoſe Paſſions and
Intereſts are contrary to each other, muſt keep a conſtant ſevere Hand
over them: For, to think of governing them, as King <hi>Charles</hi> I. did, by
a gentle and obliging Temper, was as impoſſible, as to think of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſix wild Horſes to a Coach, and to drive them without Whip or Reins. And
whoever hath read the pious Meditations of King <hi>Charles,</hi> hath there
found by his own Words, that he condeſcended againſt his own Judgment and
Conſcience, to ſettle Preſbytery in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and it appeared
ſoon after, how unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py this King was, in his too kind and tender
Condeſcenſions to the <hi>Scots,</hi> which occaſioned all thoſe
Troubles he had in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Preſbyterians called
God to witneſs, that nothing was ſo dear to them, as the Honour and Safety
of the King, and at the ſame time they conſpired againſt both. They
ſeemed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſollicitous for his Life and Safety, when they were
complotting how to entrap him: They told us, their dear Liberties and
Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hung upon the Thread of the King's Life, and yet, at that
Inſtant, they were reſolved to cut that Thread off. But the good
Chriſtians of old did not uſe this Method; they prayed for their Princes
and Governours, when moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly and unjuſtly provoked to the
contrary; <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0319800400:71"/> ſo that no Chriſtian died as a Rebel or
Traytor, in all the early Perſecutions of Chriſtianity, for ſeveral
Centuries. The Preſbyterians made it their Buſineſs, by their libellous
Pamphlets, and other wicked Arts, not only to make the King's Government
odious, his faithful Subjects ſuſpected, but alſo to excite a Hatred to
his Royal Perſon; and made uſe of the Name of <hi>Popery,</hi> to carry on
all their wicked Deſigns, being the common Engine they have always play'd
againſt the Government. For it hath been obſerved, that the Prerogative
never ſo ſuffered, no great Stateſman was ever diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor the
Liberties of the People ever wounded, but a dreadful Outcry of <hi>Popery</hi>
hath ſtill preceded; and if any durſt ſhew his Fidelity to Monarchy, by
oppoſing their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchical Projects, he was preſently blaſted with
the Name of a <hi>Court,</hi> or a <hi>Church Papiſt:</hi> And when they
could not undermine the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Fraud, they would overthrow it by main
Force, and always had thoſe in great Eſtimation, who made the biggeſt
Noiſe for Religion, and made no Scruple of involving three Kingdoms in
Miſery and Confuſion. They ſtrained at Conformity, but ſwallowed down
Rebellion; they ſtumbled at the Rails before the Altar, but leap'd over
Dethroning their King, whom they murdered firſt in his Reputation, by calling
him Tyrant, (whoſe Fault was only his Clemency) and then they murdered him in
his Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0319800400:72"/>I remember well what <hi>Joſephus</hi>
ſays in his <hi>Antiquities, Lib.</hi> 17. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. That the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> were a bold Sect, that would ſwear Allegiance to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> but were inveterate Enemies to Kings, and would not ſtick
to make Attempts upon their Lives: And the Difference betwixt thoſe
<hi>Phariſees</hi> and ours is, that they were <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Fanaticks,
and ours are Chriſtian <hi>Jews,</hi> which appears by their Principles, who
ſay, the King holds not his Power <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> but is the People's
Truſtee, and to them accountable: A Doctrine which leads to the Deſtruction
of all Kings. What our Bleſſed Saviour told his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that <hi>the
Times were coming, when they that killed them ſhould think they did God good
Service,</hi> was ſeen about this Time, when Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were pulled down for
God's Glory, when Religion was called <hi>Popery,</hi> and Monarchy
<hi>Tyranny</hi>; when Atheiſts would reform Religion, Bankrupts ſecure
Property, and Army Officers guard Liberty: When the Property of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and
Gentry was held to be deſtructive of Liberty, and it was a dangerous thing
for Men to have any Senſe of their Duty and Allegiance. But alas! thoſe
that foment ſuch Animoſities and Diviſions, do more Miſchief to their
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than foreign Enemies. No Fears of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government can
juſtify, no Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can ſanctify, ſuch Proceedings. To live
and die with their King, is the higheſt Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Subject can make,
and he ſerves his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try beſt, who well ſerves his King. And truly I am
perſwaded, that many Men entred into <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0319800400:73"/> our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebellion, who little thought of any ſuch thing, at their
firſt ſetting out, but were eaſily drawn in, by entering into the
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of evil Men, and were not guilty of ſuch black Intentions, and were
led away with the common Error and falſe Preſumptions, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was at
the Bottom, but to ſettle the true Intereſt of the Nation, and ſo fight
for the King and Parliament together, which they thought was their Duty; but
being once engaged, they went raſhly farther than they at firſt intended:
But a true Chriſtian Zeal will not ſuffer us to tranſgreſs the ſtrict
Bounds of our Duty, both to God and the King, whatever flattering Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Advantage it may give. <hi>Omne in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiti vitium ſtetit:</hi> When
Men once eſpouſe an ill Party, like thoſe running down a Hill, they
cannot ſtop when they will; and I really believe, that ſome Proſelytes
were made, who at firſt abhorred the Thoughts of Treaſon and Rebellion, but
were merely ſeduced by the Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation and Addreſs of ſome buſy
Factors for Sedition and Rebellion: And therefore wiſe Men ſhould take Care
of liſtning to any Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of their Prince, and not to hear with
Pleaſure any ſcandalous Reflections of him; for he that can with Content
hear his King vilified, will ſoon think him not fit to be a King. And tho' we
do not think at firſt to be turning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, yet whatſoever is at firſt
but a Tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, proves ſo at laſt, there being more Danger, that
the Beginnings of Vice ſhould corrupt us, than any Hope that a ſound
Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0319800400:74"/> ſhould correct the Influence of ſuch
a Vice.</p>
            <p>At this Time a great Diffidence began betwixt the Court and the
Country Party in Parliament, and the Diſadvantage lay altogether on the
King's Side, who had then ſuch Counſellours as did not do their Duty; and
ſo the Head and Members of our Monarchy entred into Diſtruſt of each
other, which filled the Kingdom with Confuſions, Miſeries, and infinite
Deſolations. The King had then no Counſellours about him, or at leaſt did
not truſt them that had the leaſt Conſideration for his Honour, or
Friendſhip for them that ſat at the Helm of Affairs; and the King had no
Counſellours but thoſe that made falſe Steps: There was no honeſt Man
that durſt ſpeak his Conſcience to the King, for fear of his Ruine, and
thoſe that the King thought moſt true to him, betrayed him every Hour; and
his very Whiſpers in his Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were preſently conveyed to them
againſt whom thoſe Whiſpers were: So that the King had very few to whom
he could breathe his Plaints, that were not ſuborned againſt him, or
averſe to his Opinions: And that King can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a great Monarch, who hath
not juſt and wiſe Counſellours, by whom he muſt inform his Reaſon,
and guide his Actions, and uſe the Service and Induſtry of the beſt and
wiſeſt Men.</p>
            <p>It was about this Time that the Parliament avowed publickly that
the Power was entirely in them, and that the King being ſever'd from 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0319800400:75"/> them, had no Royal Power in him; and the Houſe of
Commons did then petition the King touching their Privileges, declaring the
King ought to take no Notice of any Debate in either Houſe of Parliament, but
by Information from them, nor be diſpleaſed with any Debate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was
preſented to him; the Members of Parliament being the ſole Judges of their
own Errors, in Matters depending before them. Many Members thought the Petition
was too rough, but the general Fate of things then drove that Way, to
increaſe the Jealouſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his People; and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
declared, they would not proceed in any Affairs, till they had a ſatisfactory
Anſwer to their Petition. The King, before any Anſwer given, withdraws to
<hi>Hampton Court,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the Diſcontents in Parliament, who
ſent a Committee to him at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> to tell the King plainly,
that the whole Frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was out of Order, and a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance was
prepared by the Parliament, very roughly penn'd, both for Matter and
Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, wherein were mentioned all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
Misfortunes, Illegalities, and Defaults of Government, with an Enumeration of
all Grievances, and not one ſingle Error in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment omitted, nor any
paſſionate Exerciſe of Power, from the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> till
that time; and that they had no Hopes of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Diſtractions of the
Kingdom, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the evil Counſellours, and malignant Party that were
about the King. And when this <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0319800400:76"/> Remonſtrance was read in
the Houſe, ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Members did then proteſt againſt it, and were
ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> for it, but they were ſoon after releaſed.
Soon after this, the King came again to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and being informed,
that ſome Members of Parliament had private Meetings and Correſpondence
with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and countenanced the late Tumults, which came from the
City to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and which cauſed the King's Removal to
<hi>Hampton Court:</hi> The King, upon this Information, gave a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to
ſeal up their Trunks, Studies, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; upon which the Commons having
Notice, paſſed ſeveral Votes againſt it, and juſtified their Members.
Whereupon the King exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Articles againſt the five Members (which were
named) for endeavouring to ſubvert the fundamental Laws and Government, and
to deprive the King of his Regal Power. The King taking Notice, that the
Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would defend their Members, went ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the next
Morning, with his Guard of Penſioners, entered the Houſe of Commons,
ſtept into the Speaker's Chair, and look'd round the Houſe for the Members,
who having had Notice of the King's Coming, were gone; the King ſaid, he was
ſorry for the Occaſion of his Coming thither, having ſent the Day before
a Sergeant at Arms to apprehend ſome that were accuſed of High Treaſon,
whereunto he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Obedience (and not a Meſſage, as they had ſent
him) and he ſaid, no King was ever more careful of their Privileges; but,
that <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0319800400:77"/> in Caſes of High-Treaſon, no Perſon had a
Privilege; and therefore commanded the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to ſend them to him; who
replied, that he had neither Eyes to ſee, nor Tongue to ſpeak in that
Place, but as the Houſe ſhould direct him: And ſo the King returned to
<hi>Whitehall.</hi> This Action of the King's was look'd upon as a great Breach
of their Privileges, and was judged extreamly prejudicial to the King, and much
to his Enemies Advantage, and was thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange by thoſe who had
any Knowledge in publick Affairs, that the King was adviſed to ſo an
intemperate an Action, and many Excuſes were made for it, and ſaid it was
done by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Counſel, that the King ſhould not ſuffer himſelf to be
ſo baffled, which provoked him to it. Many of the King's Friends reſented
his going to the Houſe, as a Motion riſing rather from Paſſion than
Reaſon, being not guided with ſuch Diſcretion as the Touchineſs of
thoſe Times required. Upon this the Houſe of Commons frame a Declaration,
That the King's Coming to the Houſe in a warlike Manner, to the Terror of the
Parliament, was a high Breach of their Privileges, and inconſiſtent with
their Liberty, and that they could not ſit ſafely without a Guard, for
which they had been Suitors to the King, but could not obtain it. Upon this
great Tumults were in the City, and at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; and as the
King went through the City, great Tumults flocked about his Coach, beſeeching
him to agree with his Parliament. The King being in Danger of theſe Tumults,
was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0319800400:78"/> to remove again to <hi>Hampton
Court,</hi> which he did, and took with him the Queen, Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York</hi>; which was much wondred at by
prudent Men, that the King ſhould leave the Place of his Reſidence, which
brought great Diſadvantage upon himſelf and his Affairs. But the Fear of
thoſe with him, and his own Fears for them, occaſioned by the Tumults, with
the Hopes, that, by his Abſence, the Heat of the Parliament might in ſome
Meaſure abate, were alledged, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his Majeſty's Retiring. But, on
the other Side, no Reaſon can be given for Rebellion, but Pretences; for
where Monarchy is ſetled, as in <hi>England,</hi> the Reſpect due to it
could not be violated, without being guilty of a kind of Sacrilege; it being
not only a Reſemblance of that Power which God hath given the King, but a
Participation of that Power which none can reſiſt, without the Breach of
God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But People, at this time, were willing to be led blindfold by
their own Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, rather than be guided by their Prince; and a few
ſubtle Heads in a Houſe of Commons are dangerous, when they oppoſe the
Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and are backed by the Multitude. Some Men ſoftly inſtill
the Venom of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and bring about their Ends, by inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves into publick Affairs, and their Complaints ſometimes ſeem
plauſible, that they may gain Proſelytes to their Faction, who may not mean
ſo ill as their Leaders do. For, with what plauſible Pretences were many
Thouſands <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0319800400:79"/> firſt engaged in the War againſt King
<hi>Charles!</hi> What more plauſible, than to engage in a War for the
Defence of King and Parliament! It is the Conſtitution of our Government, and
we were happy, if we had well underſtood it, where our Laws are propounded by
our ſelves in Parliament, and ratified by our Kings, which is our proper
Freedom, as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and from the due Execution of thoſe Laws
ariſes our Safety: But cunning and ambitious Men in the Houſe of Commons,
who framed the Platform of all our Miſeries, fixed the odious Name of
<hi>Malignants</hi> upon all thoſe that adhered to the King, and the known
Laws, and who would not run to the ſame Exceſs of Madneſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
with them. And I well remember the time, when Parliament Soldiers plundered the
Houſes, and took away the Horſes of honeſt Countrymen, who liv'd
peaceably at Home, only becauſe they were call'd Malignants, and that Name
did warrant the Plunder. The Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of theſe Complaints brought that Civil
War upon us in 1641; and the Decoy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Men then was, to fight for King
and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but the War ended in the Ruine of both, when Subjects bathed
their Swords in the Blood of their King; a Murder committed by the Mockery of
Juſtice, never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and yet never to be mentioned, without
Horror and Deteſtation! 'Tis true, that Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are given and taken in all
Governments; Kings ſit uneaſy on their Thrones, where their People are
tumultuous, and Religion is diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0319800400:80"/> and God hath
exerciſed our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a various Face of Afflictions
in the laſt Age: Our Fears and Jealouſies did even anticipate our
Miſeries, and we oftentimes brought real Miſeries upon our ſelves, by
haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to prevent the fancied ones. But when cunning Men deſign
againſt the Government they live under, 'tis plain they would be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
themſelves, and they murmur at Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did at
<hi>Manna,</hi> and their Hearts open and ſhut according to their own Rules,
when they ſtrain at Gnats, and ſwallow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, like the
<hi>Neopolitan</hi> Shepherd, who going to his Confeſſor at
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> nothing ſo much troubled his Conſcience, as that he had
taſted a little Cream the <hi>Lent</hi> before; but he had often robbed and
murdered Paſſengers in the Mountains, which troubled not his Conſcience,
becauſe his Father and Grandfather had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that Trade before.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, the Power of King <hi>Charles</hi> (after his
ſtrange Condeſcenſion, to let the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſit as long as they
pleaſed) was little more than imaginary. The Crown of <hi>England</hi> gives
no proper Strength to them that wear it, if perſonal Force be not
proportioned to their Station; which, if it reached as far as Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, it
would be a mighty Advantage, for then a Monarch might be ſure; but as this
unhappy King's Caſe ſtood, his Empire conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted chiefly in his
Submiſſion to other Mens Wills, which was, in a Manner, but reigning by
Courteſy: And therefore the Affections of <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0319800400:81"/> the People is
generally the ſtrongeſt, but not the beſt Title, as we have often ſeen
and felt in <hi>England,</hi> in the laſt and this Age. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all
Degrees of Inferiority ſhould be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly uſed; for, if they be trampled
upon, they will certainly grow ſowre and ſtubborn, believing they have a
Right to be always well uſed: And the leaſt Grievances ſuggeſt
muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Thoughts in them, and they preſently run up their Pedigree to
<hi>Adam,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In the Beginning it was not ſo.</hi> And thus
the Houſe of Commons ſerved King <hi>Charles,</hi> being full of dutiful
Affections and Expreſſions, and abounded with large Promiſes of what
Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Duty they would ſhortly make him, in acknowledging his
Royal Favour and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be a great Bleſſing to them, and
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Liberties and Privileges; when any of which were
infringed, they were found humbly to appeal to his Juſtice for Redreſs, the
Rights and Privileges of Parliament not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only their Birth-right and
Inheritance, but of the whole Kingdom; one of which Privileges undoubtedly was,
that the whole Right of the Revenue, upon the Book of Rates, was the People's,
and proceeded only from his Subjects Gifts; and then they inflicted ſevere
Penalties upon thoſe that ſhould preſume, for the future, to collect
them, or to raiſe any Money, but as the Parliament ſhould grant and
appoint: By which Means the King was expoſed to all the Dangers that might
happen, either at Home or Abroad, and alſo deprived of the Poſſibility of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0319800400:82"/> ſupporting the Government it ſelf, and was thereby
reduced to a more helpleſs Condition, than the meaneſt of his Subjects, by
their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Votes, and unwarrantable Proceedings. Thus the Houſe of
Commons ſerved the King, and did then farther declare, that tho' the Power of
the Militia was wholly in the King, yet the Power of the Money was ſolely in
them; and that without the Power of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to pay the Soldiers, the Power
of the Militia could be of little Force: So that unleſs the King and the
Houſe of Commons agreed, the Sword muſt be left in the Scabbard. They then
alſo declared, That the King's Coming to the Houſe, and the Speech he made
there, was a great Breach; and therefore deſired he would name the Perſons
that adviſed and induced him to that Action, that they might be puniſhed,
this being the only Way to procure a firm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Amity betwixt the
King and his People.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this, the King conjured them by all the Obligations
of Love, Duty, and Obedience, to remove all their Doubts and Fears, and that
doing ſo, he did not doubt but God would render him a Great and Glorious
Prince, and them a free and happy People. But to all theſe Offers he had
moſt unſuitable Returns; ſo that then the King perceived plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that
the Houſe of Commons were by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſtealing ſo much Power into their
own Hands, that they did not care what remained in his: For they had got the
Art of impoſing <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0319800400:83"/> upon the People's Underſtandings,
againſt their own Reaſon, and perſwaded them they were in Danger of
Invaſion, when the King was not only in Peace with all Chriſtendom, but
even thoſe Princes that were in War deſired his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: And his
Majeſty was ſo moved with thoſe odious Imputations (which had moſt
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Effects upon the Minds of his People) that he was forced to comply
with many things contrary to his Judgment, to obviate greater Inconveniencies,
which were likely to riſe againſt him, by thoſe falſe and ſcandalous
Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions: And therefore he often anſwered their ſeditious and
undutiful Expreſſions, with too much Gentleneſs and Condeſcenſion,
thinking that Way to undeceive them, and thereby to reſtore them to their
Underſtandings, before they could be awakened to their Duty due to their
Sovereign, the King believing he was to ſtoop to all Arts and Means for that
Purpoſe. But herein he was ill adviſed, and took falſe Meaſures; for
tho' the Proceedings of the Houſe of Commons, and the Tumults raiſed by
them, were the higheſt Affront to his Majeſty, yet the Houſe of Peers was
then in a tractable Temper, and with a little Patience might have been brought
to blaſt all the Extravagancies of the Houſe of Commons. But other
Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were then taken, which proved fatal to the King and Kingdom. It
is true, the Votes, and Affronts of the Houſe of Commons were great, and the
Tumults alſo, but the Houſe of Lords was then well diſpoſed, and if
managed by the <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0319800400:84"/> King with a little Patience, the Higher
Houſe had blaſted all the Extravagancies of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Houſe, which, at
that Time, were the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Perſons in Deſpair, and the Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of
Men at the laſt Gaſp: And if the King would have been only a Spectator of
the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion between the two Houſes, and ſo have encouraged the Lords,
who were firm to the King, the Commons would have been brought within their due
Limits; but the King thought, by his Gentleneſs and eaſy Carriage, to
recover his Subjects to their Sobriety, before they would be apprehenſive of
their Duty, and by that Way undid all. The Truth is, the King's Paſſing the
Bill againſt the Biſhops, was a great Weakening of his Party, not only by
loſing ſo many Voices in the Lords Houſe, but it much influenced thoſe,
(whoſe Minds were then in Suſpenſe) to ſee Foundations ſhaken.
Beſides, they that knew well the King's Diſpoſition, did believe nothing
could have prevailed with him to paſs ſo Antimonarchical an Act, and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could never after be ſure the King would deny any thing that was
importunately aſked: And ſo either ſome withdrew themſelves from
thoſe Conſultations, that they might decline the Danger of Envy, by
contradicting them, or elſe ſuffered themſelves patiently to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by the Stream, and to agree to any thing that was luſtily attempted. But
truly, I think nothing ought to diſcourage publick Spirits from contributing
all they can to the Firmneſs of ſuch Counſels, as they eſteem moſt
juſt and ſafe <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0319800400:85"/> for the publick Good, and not to
withdraw themſelves upon any Pretence. Certainly the King was here
overperſwaded to agree with the Parliament in this Act againſt Biſhops,
that ſo for the future he might be able to deny them nothing; and this
Condeſcenſion of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was very ſurprizing to the whole Kingdom,
and much blamed by all, but only thoſe who had a Hand in perſwading the
King to it.</p>
            <p>It was then indeed a ſad Proſpect, to ſee the melancholy
Condition the King was in, ſunk, in a few Days, from the Heighth of all
Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which made his Enemies before to fear him, to ſuch a Degree of
Lowneſs, that his own Servants durſt hardly come near him. He then
perceived (when it was too late) that his Granting more than ever Prince had
done, had encouraged the People to aſk more than ever Subjects had demanded;
and yet the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, if he knew the particular Grounds of his Subjects
Fears, he would moſt gladly apply ſuitable Remedies, and deſired they
would not, out of Apprehenſion of poſſible Dangers, throw his Majeſty
and themſelves into real and preſent Inconveniencies; and that they would
purſue ſuch Methods as might reſtore Felicity both to King and People.
The King farther aſſured the Houſe of Commons, That he would ſatisfy
all their juſt Demands, by retracting any thing he had done, which ſeemed
but to intrench upon their Privileges, and hoped they would have the ſame
Regard to his Honour and Reputation, with that of his Subjects: But
whatſoever the <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0319800400:86"/> King ſaid or promiſed, ſignified
little with the Parliament: For then both Houſes declared, they were the
ſupreme Judicature of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and when they had declared what the Law
of the Land was, to have it diſputed or contradicted, (tho' by the King's
Command) was a Breach of Privilege, and not to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which was to
declare, in plain Terms, that a Vote of the two Houſes was obligatory to all
without; (tho' againſt his Majeſty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) which Reſolve did
abſolutely annull the Laws of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject, and let
all ſober Men ſee, that the fatal Period of both was near an End, and that
a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was then laid for Anarchy, which ſoon followed.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget to ſay, that a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War
was declared, the Queen went with the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> her Daughter, to
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> her Huſband, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the King
to <hi>Dover,</hi> from whence the King returned to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and
ſent for the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to go
with him towards <hi>York,</hi> where he was well received. The Parliament
ſent after him the nineteen Propoſitions, which were treated on, and
refuſed by the King. But I will not omit one Paſſage at
<hi>Greenwich,</hi> before the King left it, which was ſomewhat ſtrange and
ominous; which was thus. The King commanded his Statue to be carried from
<hi>Greenwich</hi> Garden into the Magazine: In the Carriage of it, the Face
being upwards, a Swallow, or ſome other <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0319800400:87"/> Bird, flying
over it, dunged in the Face of the King's Statue, which was wiped off
immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe that carried it; but notwithſtanding all Endeavours,
it could not be gotten off, but turned into Blood. This Statue was made at
<hi>Rome,</hi> by the famous Statuary Signor <hi>Bernino</hi>; and when the
King's Picture was brought to him, by which he was to make the Statue, with
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Directions to conceal whoſe Picture it was, Signor
<hi>Bernino,</hi> after having look'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time very ſtedfaſtly upon it,
ſaid, he had never ſeen any Picture, whoſe Face ſhewed ſo much
Greatneſs, and withal ſuch Marks of Sadneſs and Misfortune, which proved
too true in all its Circumſtances; for never any King kept greater State or
Order in his Court, and was more majeſtick in keeping up his Dignity, till at
laſt he was made a ſad Spectacle both to Men and Angels, before his own
Palace.</p>
            <p>But, leaving this Digreſſion, it is Time to tell you, that
both Houſes declared, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prerogative, which was before lodged in the
Crown, tho' with ſome Limitations, was now no more there, but in the two
Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Whereas, by the Conſtitution of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, the King is ſingly Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and no Power on
Earth co-ordinate with him: And as Almighty God is the abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of
all Princes, ſo imperial Princes (as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are
eſteemed) are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, next, and immediately under God, to whom alone
they are accountable. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that ſet the Laws above the
Maker <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0319800400:88"/> of them, or ſubordinate Magiſtrates above the
Fountain of the firſt Power, uſurp upon the original Founder, and take upon
them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the unchangeable Foundations of Power it ſelf: For there is
no longer any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the Inferior incroaches upon the Superior, and
confounds the Relations of Kings and Subjects, in that Anarchical Whimſey of
imagining that Kings are to govern by Contract, and Subjects to obey
accordingly: Whereas no Man can ſhew, that there ever was an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Contract between former Kings and the People of <hi>England,</hi> beſides
that which was implied in the Conſtitution; and the very Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of
one is repugnant to all our Laws, and expreſsly oppoſite to the Words and
Senſe of many of our Statutes; there being nothing more irreconcileable and
contradictory, than a Contract by which our Kings are made judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accountable to their People, or cenſurable for Miſcarriages in their
Government, when ſeveral Acts of Parliament do not only declare our Kings to
be unaccountable, but make it High Treaſon to take up Arms againſt them,
upon any Pretence whatſoever. And, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it either lawful or
practicable, to queſtion and depoſe Kings, without a Liberty of taking up
Arms againſt them, is a Contradiction that none will pretend to reconcile,
who are not Lunatick, or deeply Hypochondriacal: And as for that Contract in
our firſt Conſtitution, it only declares the Ends for which our Princes
were to Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> The Safety, Peace, and <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0319800400:89"/>
Proſperity of their People, to teach and inſtruct them, that they were to
govern by Laws; but it no way promiſes, that they ſhould be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to
their People, or arraigned by their Subjects, leaving them for that only
reſponſible to God, and in no manner puniſhable, but by the Stings of
their own Conſciences: <hi>For who can ſay to the King, what doeſt
thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this Time the War was openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the King,
after his being refuſed Entrance into <hi>Hull</hi>; whereupon he went to
<hi>York.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was named General for the
Parliament: the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Horſe: The Lord
<hi>Kimbolton, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, Balfour,</hi> and <hi>Ramſey,</hi> General
Officers for the Parliament. Whereupon the King na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Earl of
<hi>Lindſey</hi> Lord Chamberlain of <hi>England,</hi> to be his Lieutenant
General, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Couſin to the King, General of the Horſe,
Sir <hi>Jacob Aſtley</hi> Major General of the Foot, and Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi>
Commiſſary General of the Horſe.</p>
            <p>Thus the War was began, and the King, by a very unhappy Accident,
was obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare before he was in any Condition for Action. The
Occaſion, This: Collonel <hi>Goring,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
<hi>Portſmouth,</hi> declared for the King, before the King was ready to
march to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Upon ſome private Suſpicion the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had of
<hi>Goring,</hi> he was ſent for, and examined, and upon his Confeſſion
of ſome things relating to the Army, the Lords <hi>Wilmot, Aſhburnham</hi>
and <hi>Pollard,</hi> all three Members, <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0319800400:90"/> were expelled the
Houſe of Commons, and ſent to ſeveral Priſons; but <hi>Peircy</hi> and
<hi>Jermyn,</hi> who were alſo Members accuſed, eſcaped. This
Confeſſion of <hi>Goring</hi> gave him a great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the
Parliament, who ſent him back to his Government with Money to pay the
Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and to take Care of his Government. By his great Dexterity, he
perſwaded the King, that he was not only ſorry for the Fault he had
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but that he would ſoon redeem it by ſome ſignal Service to
the King; and he managed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch Addreſs, that he received
Three Thouſand Pounds from the Queen, to fortify the Garriſon, when it
ſhould be neceſſary for him to declare for the King; and at the ſame
time he received a great Supply from the Parliament, for Payment of the
Garriſon, that it might be kept for their Service. Some time after, upon
ſome new Information, he was ſent for again, and appeared in the Houſe,
and juſtified himſelf with ſo much Innocence and Unaffected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that
the Houſe of Commons, after an Apology for the Trouble they had given him,
commanded him to return to his Government, and to take great Care for the
Safety of the Place, which was of much Importance to them, and conſented to
all he propoſed in behalf of the Garriſon. In the mean time, he aſſured
his Majeſty, (by thoſe that were employed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them) that in a ſhort
time he ſhould be in a Condition to declare for the King, when the King
ſhould require it; but by the Sequel, we ſhall find he was obliged to do
it, much <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0319800400:91"/> ſooner than he was prepared for it, tho' no
ſooner than he had Reaſon to expect it. It ſeems, when the Lord
<hi>Kimbolton</hi> received his Commiſſion to be Lieutenant General of the
Horſe for the Parliament, <hi>Goring</hi> was appointed to be his
Major-General: But <hi>Goring</hi> wrote to his Lordſhip, deſiring he might
be excuſed for his Attendance upon the Army, till it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to march,
that he might be preſent in his Garriſon, till ſome Fortifications were
perfected, that were neceſſary for that important Place: Upon which the
Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> prevailed with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that
<hi>Goring</hi> ſhould not be ſent for, till they were ready to enter upon
Action; and, at laſt, upon ſeveral Inſtances from the Lord
<hi>Kimbolton</hi> to General <hi>Goring,</hi> to come away, after ſeveral
Excuſes, he told him, he was adviſed by Counſel, that it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to leave the Place without the King's Leave, having received the Command of
that Place from him. Hereby the King received a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Reputation,
that ſo important a Place as <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> with ſo conſiderable
an Officer as Collonel <hi>Goring,</hi> had declared for him: But his
declaring, before the King was ready, or the Garriſon in Condition to
ſuſtain a Siege, was the Cauſe of the King's Reſolution of ſetting up
his Standard; and the Loſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> which ſoon happened,
gave a great Diſorder to the King's Affairs: For the Parliament ſent
forthwith to beſiege it, and <hi>Goring</hi> was obliged to ſurrender it,
upon very good Articles for himſelf, going into <hi>France</hi> with the
Money he <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0319800400:92"/> had received on both Sides, without making good
his Promiſe to either. But this his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was much reſented by all the
King's Friends, and more particularly by thoſe who were expelled the Houſe.
If his Conſcience and Integrity had equalled his Wit and Courage, he had been
one of the moſt eminent Men of the Age he lived in: But he could not
reſiſt Temptations, and was a Man without Scruple, and loved no Man ſo
well, but he would cozen him, and afterwards laugh at him, as he did at the
Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi>; and of all his Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which were many)
Diſſimulation was his Maſter-piece, in which he ſo much excelled, with
his great Dexterity, ſeeming Modeſty and Unaffectedneſs, that in this
Concern, of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> he cozened the Houſe of Commons twice,
where were many Perſons not eaſily to be deceived; neither were they
aſhamed to be cozened twice by him, who was ſo perfect a Maſter in that
Art of Deceiving.</p>
            <p>Upon this Incident, the King publiſhed a Declaration, wherein
all the inſolent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Actions of both Houſes were recited,
forbidding all his Subjects from paying any Obedience to them, and requiring
all that could bear Arms, to be preſent to ſerve him at
<hi>Nottingham,</hi> the 24th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, on which Day he
intended to ſet up his Royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, where all his good Subjects were
obliged to attend. Many thought his Majeſty had better have ſet it up at
<hi>York:</hi> But the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King had to be near <hi>London,</hi>
and his <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0319800400:93"/> Hopes of great Effects from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi>
(which proved vain) made him prefer <hi>Notingham</hi>; and the Earl of
<hi>Cumberland</hi> was left Commander in Chief of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi>
aſſiſted with Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham.</hi> Moſt Perſons in
<hi>Yorkſhire</hi> were very faithful to the King, except the Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> and his Son, who were to be made Priſoners; the Seizing of
them had probably prevented the Miſchief which ſoon after broke out in
thoſe Parts; but the King (being always ill ill adviſed) could not admit
they ſhould be made Priſoners. The King came to <hi>Nottingham</hi> ſome
Days before his Standard was ſet up, and hearing ſome Regiments, by Order
from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> were marching to <hi>Coventry,</hi> the
King haſtened thither with ſome Troops of Horſe well armed, and got
thither the Day before the Parliament's Forces. However, the Gates were ſhut
againſt him, and ſome of his Servants kill'd from the Walls. The King had
no Remedy for this Affront, but lodged that Night at <hi>Stonely Abbey,</hi> at
Sir <hi>Thomas Lee</hi>'s. The next Day the King's Body of Horſe, being near
the Enemy at <hi>Southam,</hi> who were not above Twelve Hundred Foot, with one
Troop of Horſe, in a free Campagne, yet they retired without being charged.
Commiſſary <hi>Wilmot</hi> then commanded the King's Horſe, and ſeveral
Reflections were made upon his not charging them. About this time I was with
the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> at <hi>Warwick,</hi> having left
<hi>Coventry</hi> ſome Months before, where I reſided with my Father, being
then very young, and went with two Horſes, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0319800400:94"/> and one of
his Men, to the Earl of <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton,</hi> who was Lord Lieutenant of
<hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> with whom I was when he firſt put the
Commiſſion of Array in Execution at <hi>Coleſhill,</hi> eight Miles from
<hi>Coventry</hi> towards <hi>Bermingham.</hi> From thence we went to
<hi>Warwick,</hi> in Hopes to have ſurprized that Caſtle; but Sir
<hi>Edward Peito</hi> was gotten into it before, and had Orders to keep it for
the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> whoſe Caſtle it was, and his Lordſhip was then
employed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to ſettle the Militia in
<hi>Warwickſhire.</hi> The Caſtle was ſtrong, and well ſcituated, the
River <hi>Avon</hi> running by it. Our Endeavours for taking it, were to little
Purpoſe, for we had only two ſmall Pieces of Cannon, which were brought
from <hi>Compton Houſe,</hi> belonging to the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi>
and thoſe were drawn up to the Top of the Church Steeple, and were
diſcharged at the Caſtle, to which they could do no Hurt, but only frighted
them within the Caſtle, who ſhot into the Street, and killed ſeveral of
our Men. The King (as I ſaid before) being repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from
<hi>Coventry,</hi> haſtened back towards <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> and the Earl
of <hi>Eſſex</hi> drawing near us with his Army, being then at
<hi>Southam,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Northampton,</hi> with his Troop of Gentlemen,
which were numerous, marched towards <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> where we met Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> with ſome Troops of Horſe, with whom we joined, and drew up
in the Fields, not far from <hi>Powych</hi> Bridge, upon the <hi>Severn,</hi>
where we ſtood very quietly for ſome time, being informed that the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> was marching after us. We had <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0319800400:95"/> not been
long in this Poſture, before ſome Troops of Horſe, commanded by Collonel
<hi>Nathaniel Fiennes,</hi> who lay on the other Side <hi>Powych</hi> Bridge,
expecting to meet the Vanguard of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army, paſſed the
Bridge, and having paſſed the Defiles, he drew up his Troops not far from
ours, which the Prince gave him Time to do; but then the Prince charged and
routed them, and ſent them back over the Bridge, in great Confuſion and
Diſorder. In this Action we took ſeveral Priſoners, amongſt whom was
one Collonel <hi>Sandys,</hi> who was mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and died ſome Hours
after. Major <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> and ſeveral others, were killed upon the
Place. This was the firſt Action I was ever in, and being upon an unruly
Horſe, he ran away with me amongſt the Enemy, while we purſued them to
the Bridge, in which Hurly I loſt my Hat; but my Horſe's Courage being
ſomewhat abated, I ſtopp'd him before we came to the Bridge, and ſo
returned with our own Troops. We retired that Evening into the City of
<hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> where being refreſhed, we marched that Night towards
<hi>Ludlow,</hi> where we ſtayed ſome time; and from thence we went to
<hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where we ſtay'd till the King came thither with his
Army, which much increaſed in thoſe Quarters, by ſeveral Regiments newly
raiſed in thoſe Parts for the King. The next Day after our leaving
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> came thither with his
Army, and made that City his Head Quarters for ſome time. The King ſtay'd
at <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> till his Army was well recruited, <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0319800400:96"/>
and then Reſolutions were taken to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London,</hi> in Hopes
to get thither before the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was then, with the
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Army, about <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Warwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the King ſtay'd about <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> his Army was
modelled into ſeveral Regiments of Horſe, Foot, and Dragoons, which, in
all, made a conſiderable Body: The Horſe were put into ſeveral Brigades,
the Foot into Tertia's (as they were then called) and we had Three or Four
Regiments of Dragoons: Our chief Want was Arms; for moſt of the Regiments,
which were raiſed in <hi>Wales,</hi> were very ill armed. However, they were
brave and reſolute to ſerve their King, with ſuch Arms as they had, or
could get in their March, and our Army increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed daily, by many coming to us
from all Parts, as we marched. From <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> we marched thro' Part
of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire:</hi> I was then with the
Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> in his own Troop, which conſiſted of One
Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gentlemen of Quality. The Lord <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton,</hi> eldeſt Son to the
Earl, was the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Man; Sir <hi>Charles Compton,</hi> his ſecond Son,
was Cornet; and Mr. <hi>Arden,</hi> a Gentleman of one of the moſt ancient
Families in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire,</hi> was Lieutenant to the Earl. We were then
put into the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Horſe, which
conſiſted of ſix gallant Troops, beſides the Servants: The Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi>'s own Troop commanded by Sir <hi>Thomas Byron,</hi> who was
Collonel of the Regiment, with Sir <hi>Thomas Daniel</hi> Lieutenant, and Mr.
<hi>Mettham</hi> 
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0319800400:97"/> of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> Cornet: The Duke
of <hi>York</hi>'s Troop, commanded by the Lord <hi>Aubigny,</hi> Brother to
the Duke of <hi>Richmond:</hi> The Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s Troop,
commanded by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Collonel <hi>Cavendiſh:</hi> The Earl of
<hi>Lindſey</hi>'s Troop, commanded by his Son the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi>
of <hi>Eresby:</hi> The Earls of <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton</hi> and
<hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> commanded each their own Troop; and all the Servants of
the whole Regiment were put into one Troop, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Captain
<hi>Daviſon,</hi> an old experienced Low-Country Soldier, who was recommended
for that Employ, by the old Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We marched thro' a great Part of <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and
came under <hi>Wormington</hi> Hills, on <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening, the
Twenty Second Day of <hi>October,</hi> 1642. The King lodged that Night, at Sir
<hi>William Chancie</hi>'s, at <hi>Ratott</hi> Bridge, and Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> at the Lord <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>'s, at <hi>Wormleighton.</hi> The
Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s Regiment, in which we were, was quartered in two or
three Villages under <hi>Wormington</hi> Hills, When it was dark, we ſaw
ſeveral Fires not far from us, and ſending out a Party to ſee, we were
ſoon informed, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was there with his whole
Army, and quartered at <hi>Keinton,</hi> a Market-Town. Whereupon our whole
Regiment drew into the Fields, and had Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions brought us from the
Villages, and we forthwith gave Notice to the King and Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi>
and ſoon after we received Orders to be upon our Guard all Night, and to be
the <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0319800400:98"/> next Morning by Eight, at the Rendezvous upon
<hi>Wormington</hi> Hills. The King, with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> came ſoon after, and Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who
called a general Council of War, where it was debated, whether to march towards
<hi>London,</hi> or to march back, and fight the Enemy, whom we ſaw from the
Hill, embattelling their Army in the Bottom near <hi>Keinton.</hi> To march
from them was thought diſhonourable, as if we feared them, and they would be
ſure to follow, and give us continual Trouble in our March, when we ſhould
not, perhaps, find ſo good Occaſion to fight them; and ſo it was
reſolved, that we ſhould go down the Hill and attack them. Whereupon great
Preparations were made, and Precautions taken, for deſcending the Hill, which
was very ſteep and long, and had been impracticable, if the Enemy had drawn
nearer to the Bottom of it; but we ſaw by the Ranging their Army, that they
intended to ſtay there for us, having a good Market Town by them, and not far
from <hi>Warwick.</hi> In the firſt Place, it was reſolved, that Collonel
<hi>Waſhington,</hi> with his Regiment of Dragoons, ſhould deſcend the
Hill, and poſſeſs ſome Incloſures and Briars on the right Hand of our
Army, and a forlorn Hope of Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe were ordered likewiſe to
deſcend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Army, and the Carriage Horſes of the Cannon were put
behind the Carriages, excepting a Horſe or two before, and the Foot were
orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deſcend as well as they could. The King was that Day in a black
Velvet Coat lin'd <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0319800400:99"/> with Ermin, and a Steel Cap covered with
Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet. He rode to every Brigade of Horſe, and to all the Tertia's of Foot,
to encourage them to their Duty, being accompanied by the great Officers of the
Army: His Majeſty ſpoke to them with great Courage and Chearfulneſs,
which cauſed Huzza's thro' the whole Army. I take the Liberty here to
remember one Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which was remarkable. It ſeems, that very Morning,
before the Army deſcended the Hill, the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> (being
returned from his Travels) waited then upon the King, by whom his Grace was
very well received and careſſed. He brought with him one Mr.
<hi>Scroop,</hi> who had accompanied him. After this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had kiſſed
the King's Hand, as alſo that of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> told the King, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Father was Sir <hi>Gervaſe Scroop,</hi> who had a good Eſtate, had raiſed
a Foot Regiment in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> to ſerve his Majeſty, and was
then in the Army, but very angry with his Son, and would not ſee him, or be
reconciled to him, becauſe he went with the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> without
his Father's Conſent, and had ſpent much more Money than he allowed him.
The Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> therefore prayed the King to make them Friends.
Whereupon the King ſent for the Father, and told him, it was his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
he ſhould be reconciled to his Son, who being then preſent, demanded upon
his Knees his Father's Bleſſing; whereupon the Father gave it him, and
ſaid thus to his Son: <hi>I am</hi> 
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0319800400:100"/> 
               <hi>now going down
the Hill to ſerve the King, and if I be killed, I have left you, my Son,
enough to ſpend:</hi> And the Son preſently anſwered; <hi>And if I be
killed, I ſhall leave you enough to pay for me.</hi> And ſo the Father and
Son went down the Hill together; and it ſo happened, that the Son ſaved his
Father's Life, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received many Wounds, was ſtript, and left for
dead, and was brought off the next Morning by his Son, in one of the King's
Coaches, who lived ſome Years after, always very kind to his Son, and left
him a very good Eſtate. I have preſumed to add this Particular, becauſe I
have had great Obligations to that Family; and upon King <hi>Charles</hi> II.'s
Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was made Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> by the Name of Sir
<hi>Adrian Scroop:</hi> And I was then one of the Gentlemen that brought him to
the King, when his Majeſty put the Red Ribband about him. But, leaving this
Digreſſion, let us turn again to the King's Army, which, about Ten in the
Morning, began to deſcend the Hill, the Foot getting down ſeveral Ways
which the Horſe could not do, by reaſon of the Hill's Steepneſs. When the
whole Army was down, and drawn into Order, the King deſired the Earl of
<hi>Lindſey,</hi> who was his Lieutenant General, that he would permit
General <hi>Ruthen,</hi> an old <hi>Scotch</hi> Officer, and who had long
ſerved under <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> the late King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
and had been a Lieutenant General in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to draw up his Majeſty's Army
that Day, and to command it, being an old experienced <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0319800400:101"/>
General; to which the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> (being wholly made of
Obedience) willingly complied, and ſaid he would ſerve the King that Day,
as Collonel of the King's Royal Regiment of Foot Guards, which he did,
accompanied by his Son, the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Eresby.</hi> The
Enemy had all the Morning to draw up their Army, in a great plain Field, which
they did to their beſt Advantage, by putting ſeveral Bodies of Foot with
Retrenchments and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non before them, and all their Foot were lined with
Horſe behind them, with Intervals betwixt each Body, for their Horſe to
enter, if need required; and upon their right Wing were ſome Briars covered
with Dragoons, and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, on their left Wing, was the Town of
<hi>Keinton,</hi> which ſupplied them with Proviſions, and where their
Baggage and Carriages were.</p>
            <p>Our whole Army was drawn up in a Body, the Horſe Three deep in
each Wing, and the Foot in the Center Six deep. The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s
Regiment was on the right Wing, which was commanded by Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi>
and Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Waſhington</hi> was with his Dragoons upon our Right. In
the Center was the Infantry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief by General <hi>Ruthen,</hi>
and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, by Sir <hi>Jacob Aſtley.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi>
marched on Foot, in the Head of the Regiment of the Royal Foot Guards, with his
Son, the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edmond Verney</hi> carried the
Royal Standard. The left Wing of our Horſe was commanded by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary
General <hi>Wilmot,</hi> with Collonel <hi>Fielding</hi> 
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0319800400:102"/>
and ſome other principal Officers; and Collonel <hi>George Liſle,</hi> with
Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Ennis,</hi> were in the left Wing, with a Regiment of
Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, to defend the Briars on that Side, and we had a Body of Reſerve,
of Six Hundred Horſe, commanded by the Earl of <hi>Carnarvon.</hi> When our
Army was drawn up at the Foot of the Hill, and ready to march, all the Generals
went to the King (who intended to march with the Army) and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he would
retire to a riſing Ground, ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from thence, on the Right, with
the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Duke of <hi>York</hi> (having his Guard of
Penſioners on Horſeback with him) from whence he might ſee the Iſſue
of the Battle, and be out of Danger; and that otherwiſe the Army would not
advance towards the Enemy: To which the King (very unwillingly) was at laſt
perſwaded.</p>
            <p>Juſt before we began our March, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
paſſed from one Wing to the other, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poſitive Orders to the
Horſe, to march as cloſe as was poſſible, keeping their Ranks with
Sword in Hand, to receive the Enemy's Shot, without firing either Carbin or
Piſtol, till we broke in amongſt the Enemy, and then to make uſe of our
Fire-Arms as need ſhould require; which Order was punctually obſerved. The
Enemy ſtayed to receive us, in the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as was formerly
declared; and when we came within Cannon Shot of the Enemy, they diſcharged
at us three Pieces of Cannon from their left Wing, commanded by Sir <hi>James
Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey;</hi> which Cannon mounted over our Troops, without doing any Hurt,
except that their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0319800400:103"/> Shot killed a
Quarter-Maſter in the Rear of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Troop. We ſoon
after engaged each other, and our Dragoons on our Right beat the Enemy from the
Briars, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> led on our right Wing ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that, after a ſmall Reſiſtance, we forced their left Wing, and were
Maſters of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; and the Prince being extreamly eager of this
Advantage (which he better knew how to take, than to keep) was not content with
their Cannon, and keeping their Ground, but eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued the Enemy, who
fled on the other Side of <hi>Keinton</hi> towards <hi>Warwick:</hi> And we of
the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s Regiment, (who were all ſcattered) purſued
alſo, till we met with two Foot Regiments of <hi>Hambden</hi> and
<hi>Hollis,</hi> and with a Regiment of Horſe coming from <hi>Warwick</hi> to
their Army, which made us haſten as faſt back as we had purſued. In this
Purſuit I was wounded in the Head by a Perſon who turned upon me, and
ſtruck me with his Pole-axe, and was ſeconding his Blow, when Sir
<hi>Thomas Byron</hi> being near, he ſhot him dead with his Piſtol, by
which Means I came back. In fine, by meeting theſe three Regiments, we were
obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to return back to our Army, and then found our great Error, in leaving
our Foot naked, who were rudely handled by the Enemy's Horſe and Foot
together, in our Abſence, who fell principally upon the King's Royal Regiment
of Foot Guards, who loſt Eleven of Thirteen Colours, the King's
Standard-Brearer, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Verney,</hi> killed, and the Royal Standard 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0319800400:104"/> taken, which was preſently retaken by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>John
Smith,</hi> who was Knighted for it that Night by the King, under the Standard
Royal, and made a Baronet with the uſual Ceremonies; and had afterwards a
large Medal of Gold gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, with the King's Picture on the one Side, and
the Banner on the other, which he always wore to his dying Day, in a large
green watered Ribband, croſs his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. He was afterwards killed at the
Battle of <hi>Alresford</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> in the Year 1644, which
was called <hi>Cheriton</hi> Fight, with the Lord <hi>Bernard Stewart,</hi>
Brother to the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and ſeveral others. Sir <hi>Robert
Walſh,</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> who alſo pretended that he was very
inſtrumental in regaining the Standard, did alſo in the ſame Manner wear
a green Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a Medal; but whether it was given him by Order, or how he
came by it, I do not know, tho' I have often ſeen him wear it. In this Battle
of <hi>Edgehill</hi> (as it was always called) during our Purſuit of the
Enemy, the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> was mortally wounded, and taken
Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, with his Son the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> who killed the Man that
wounded his Father, who died in the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Coach, as he
was carrying to <hi>Warwick.</hi> Now, when we returned from following the
Enemy, the Night came ſoon upon us, whereas, in all Probability, we had
gained the Victory, and made an End of the War, if we had only kept our Ground,
after we had beaten the Enemy, and not left our Foot naked to their Horſe and
Foot: And, <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0319800400:105"/> to add to our Misfortune, a careleſs
Soldier, in fetching Powder (where a Magazin was) clapt his Hand careleſsly
into a Barrel of Powder, with his Match lighted betwixt his Fingers, whereby
much Powder was blown up, and many kill'd. The Night then ſoon parted both
Armies, and both Sides pretended to the Victory; but ſince we retired up the
Hill, from whence we came down, and left the <hi>Champ de Battaile</hi> to the
Enemy, I think we had no great Reaſon to brag of a Victory: For, the King,
with a great Part of the Army, marched that Night up to <hi>Wormington</hi>
Hills, it being a hard Froſt, and very cold. But that which made us think we
had the Victory, was, that whereas the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was commanded
to hinder our getting to <hi>London</hi> before him, by this Battle we were
neareſt <hi>London,</hi> and might have been there much before the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> if we had taken right Meaſures: So that it may be ſaid
of this Battle, <hi>Victus uterque fuit, Victor uterque fuit.</hi> There is
always great Difference in Relation of Battles, which is uſually according to
the Intereſt of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; when it is certain, that, in a Battle, the
next Man can hardly make a true Relation of the Actions of him that is next
him; for, in ſuch a Hurry and Smoke as in a ſet Field, a Man takes Notice
of nothing but what relates to his own Safety: So that no Man give a clear
Account of particular Paſſages.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, being next after the Battle, ſeveral
Parties were ſent down to view <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0319800400:106"/> the Dead, the greateſt
Part of the Enemy having retired in the Night to the Town of <hi>Keinton,</hi>
which was near them; and Mr. <hi>Adrian Scroop</hi> having ſeen his Father
fall (being much woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) deſired the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> to ſpeak to
the King, that one of his Coaches might go with him, to bring up his Father's
Body; which being granted, he found his Father ſtript, with ſeveral very
dangerous Wounds, and that he was alive: Whereupon he lapt him up in his Cloak,
and brought him in the Coach, where he was preſently dreſſed by the
King's Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and by their Care and Skill was cured, and lived many
Years after, tho' he had ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Wounds, and had died upon the Place, but
that the Coldneſs of the Weather ſtopp'd the Bleeding of his Wounds, which
ſaved alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Mens Lives that were wounded. We reſted all
<hi>Monday</hi> upon the Hill, to put our Army in Order; and ſeeing the Enemy
(as we thought) were preparing to retire, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was
reſolved, that <hi>Monday</hi> Night, to go down the Hill, at a Place called
<hi>Sun-Riſing,</hi> a Mile on our left Hand, and to fall upon the Enemy in
their Retreat; and on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early, the Prince, with
a ſtrong Detatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe and Dragoons, fell into <hi>Keinton,</hi>
where he found all Houſes full of wounded and ſick Men, with divers
Officers, and ſeveral Waggons loaded with Muſkets and Pikes, and all Sorts
of Ammunition, preparing to follow the Army, which was marched towards
<hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi> Theſe Arms were extreamly wanting in <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0319800400:107"/>
our Army, and were a very good Supply for ſome Hundreds of <hi>Welchmen</hi>
were ſo brave, that they had no Arms but Pitchforks, and ſuch like Tools,
and many only with good Cudgels; yet they went down the Hill as eagerly to
fight, as the beſt armed Men among them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt of the Gentry in
North <hi>Wales</hi> moſt willingly ingaged for the King, and raiſed what
Men they poſſibly could for his Service, while the King ſtayed in
<hi>Shropſhire</hi>; and the Gentry of that Country did in a moſt
particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhew their Zeal for his Majeſty's Service, there being
ſcarce a Family of any Conſideration, in any of thoſe Counties, that was
not ingaged for the King; as the <hi>Salisburies,</hi> the <hi>Moſtyns,</hi>
the <hi>Trevors,</hi> the <hi>Thelwells,</hi> and ſeveral others whoſe
Families I have forgotten: But this I certainly knew, that none ſerved the
King with greater Loyalty and Affection, than all the Gentry of North
<hi>Wales,</hi> wherein the Family of <hi>Bulkeley</hi> muſt not be
forgotten, who were always very eminent for the King's Service.</p>
            <p>After this Battle of <hi>Edgehill,</hi> it was reſolved the King
ſhould haſten to <hi>London,</hi> and that if he could get thither before
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with his Army, the King would be certainly well
received, and, in all Probability, make an End of the War, of which the
Parliament was in ſuch Fear, that ſeveral Expreſſes were ſent to the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to make all poſſible Haſte with his Army to
<hi>London,</hi> and prevent the King's Coming before him: But our King trifled
away his Time in taking <hi>Banbury</hi> and <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0319800400:108"/>
               <hi>Broughton Houſe,</hi> which belonged to the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> Places of
very little Conſideration! and ſo marched very ſlowly towards
<hi>London,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> with his Army arrived
before him, tho' the King's Army was much nearer <hi>London,</hi> after the
Battle of <hi>Edgehill,</hi> if right Uſe had been made of it. By Judgment of
moſt, the Victory in this Battle was the King's, becauſe he gain'd his
Point, a clear Paſſage for his Way to <hi>London</hi>; of which the
Parliament was ſo ſenſible, that not only reiterated Orders were ſent
to haſten the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s March, but all the Shops, both in
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> were ſhut up the next Day
after the Battle, that the People might be in a better Readineſs to defend
themſelves and the Parliament.</p>
            <p>But alas! the King retarded his March, of which the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> taking hold, got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and <hi>London</hi>; and
in this our March towards <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament ſent a Petition to
the King, in a much humbler Strain than their former Meſſages to the King
uſed to be; which Petition the King liked well, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to reſide
at his Caſtle of <hi>Windſor,</hi> there to receive the Parliament's
Propoſitions: But News being then brought to the King, that
<hi>Eſſex</hi> was advanced towards him, and had poſſeſſed the
Paſſes of <hi>Windſor, Kingſton,</hi> and <hi>Acton,</hi> and that if
<hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould alſo take <hi>Brentford,</hi> the King would be
wholly ſurrounded, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either of moving or ſubſiſting:
Whereupon a Council of War was called, and Reſolutions taken, that the King's
Army ſhould advance to <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0319800400:109"/> 
               <hi>Brentford,</hi> where, at
the firſt, we found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Oppoſition. The Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, where I was, being drawn up behind a
great Hedge, where the Enemy had planted ſome Cannon, which we ſaw not,
till they played ſo faſt upon us, that we loſt ſome Men, and were
obliged to draw off and retire for our better Security; and upon our Foot's
coming up, we beat the Regiments of <hi>Hambden</hi> and <hi>Hollis</hi> out of
the Town, took ſeveral Priſoners and Arms, and ſunk two great Barks in
the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> with many Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: And as two other Regiments
came up to their Succour, they were alſo beaten, and we took ſome Colours
and Cannon, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Maſters of <hi>Brentford,</hi> until the Night;
but then finding the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with his Army, was drawn out
upon <hi>Turnham Green,</hi> with the Trained Bands of the City, and that the
Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Army was double to the King's, and that moſt of our Ammunition was
ſpent; it was therefore thought fit by the Council, that the King ſhould
retreat. Whereupon the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired that Night to the Lord
<hi>Cottington</hi>'s Houſe, near <hi>Hounſlow,</hi> and we marched the
next Day by <hi>Colebrook,</hi> towards <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi>
the firſt of which Places was garriſoned, and <hi>Oxford</hi> was the
King's Head Quarters, where he made his Reſidence. I can give this Relation
with Certainty, being preſent in all that March, and in the Actions at
<hi>Brentford,</hi> till the King's Return to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and then the
Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> was commanded to <hi>Banbury,</hi> which 
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0319800400:110"/> was given him for Winter Quarters, with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to
raiſe a Regiment of Horſe.</p>
            <p>This Advance of the King's Army towards <hi>London,</hi> when a
Treaty of Peace was propoſed both by the Parliament and the City of
<hi>London,</hi> in a milder Strain than they had ever done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was by
many thought imprudent to make the Breach wider, and divers Reflections were
made upon it: However, the King ſent Word to the Houſes, that he intended
to ſettle his Court at ſuch a Diſtance from them, as might take away all
Miſapprehenſions. Hereupon the City petition the King, profeſſing their
Grief for his Diſtruſt of them, and declare their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to him. And the
Parliament finding the general Inclinations of the People for Peace, reſolved
to ſend ſome Propoſitions to the King, which not being accepted, the
Treaty was ſoon broken off. But then another Treaty was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in
<hi>March</hi> following, and new Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners named, which were only the
Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with four of the Houſe of Commons, who had
free Acceſs to the King, who uſed them with great Civility and Favour, and
treated perſonally with them, becauſe their Inſtructions were very
ſtrict, and tied them up to treat with none but the King himſelf, where
they often attended, and had Acceſs at all Times when they deſired it, and
were allowed a very free Debate with his Majeſty. In this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the King
ſhewed his great Parts and Abilities, Strength of Reaſon, and Quickneſs
of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, with much Patience hearing what was <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0319800400:111"/>
objected againſt him, wherein he allowed the Commiſſioners all Freedom,
and when he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from them in Opinion, he would tell them, by your Favour,
my Lord <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (who was the chief of the Commiſſioners) I
am not of your Opinion, or, I think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and would himſelf ſum up
their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and give a clear Judgment upon them. The King's great
Unhappineſs was, that he had a better Opinion of others Judgment, than of his
own (tho' weaker than his own) and of this theſe Commiſſioners at that
time had a ſad Experience, to their great Trouble.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, in this Treaty, they ſo preſſed his Majeſty
with their beſt Reaſons and Arguments, to grant what they deſired, that
the King was ſo fully ſatisfied with their Reaſons, that he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
agreed to what they propoſed, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give them their Anſwer the
next Morning, according to their Deſires; but becauſe it was then late, and
paſt Midnight, he deferred to give his Anſwer in Writing till the next
Morning, and commanded them to wait upon him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. The
Commiſſioners hereupon went to their Lodging full of Joy, in Hopes to
receive the Anſwer agreed upon; but, inſtead of what they expected, and was
promiſed by the King, he gave them a Paper quite contrary to what was
concluded between them the Night before. The Commiſſioners did moſt
humbly expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with his Majeſty, and preſſed him upon his Royal
Word, and the ill Conſequences they feared would follow upon this new Paper:
To <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0319800400:112"/> which the King told them, he had altered his Mind, and
that the Paper he gave them was his Anſwer which he was reſolved to make
upon their laſt Debate, and they could obtain no other Anſwer from him,
which gave them much Sadneſs and Trouble. After this ſad Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(which the Commiſſioners did not expect) they enquired of ſome of the
King's particular Counſellours, how the King came to change his Mind, who
ſaid, that after the King had left his Council, and was undreſſing,
ſome of thoſe Gentlemen about him, whoſe Intereſt was for Continuance
of the War, and hearing what Anſwer the King had promiſed, never left
preſſing the King, till they had perſwaded and prevailed with him, to
change his former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and to order his Anſwer to be drawn as then
delivered; which being intimated to the Commiſſioners, they uſed their
utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to diſſwade the King from ſending this Anſwer,
fearing it would break the Treaty; but they could not prevail, the Anſwer was
ſent, and upon the Parliament's receiving it, they fortwith recalled their
Commiſſioners, and the Treaty ended unſucceſsfully, having laſted
from the Beginning of <hi>March</hi> till the Middle of <hi>April.</hi> This
Relation I had from one of the Commiſſioners, my Couſin German, who, I am
ſure, wiſhed well to the King, and deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a good
Peace between the King and his People: And this Gentleman was after accuſed
in the Houſe of Commons, by a Lord who was at the Time of the Treaty with the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0319800400:113"/> King in <hi>Oxford,</hi> but ſoon after deſerted the
King, and went to the Parliament, and accuſed that Commiſſioner to have
had ſeveral private Conferences with the King, unknown to the reſt of the
Commiſſioners; and if that Perſon had not been powerfully ſupported,
and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended by Mr. <hi>Denzell Hollis,</hi> who was alſo a
Commiſſioner, that other Perſon had been ruined by that Lord's falſe
Accuſation, who quite loſt his Reputation by it. Thus we ſee a good King
was unhappily miſled by thoſe about him, which cauſed him often to
refuſe thoſe things to which he ſhould chearfully have conſented, and
freely have condeſcended to many things which he ſhould have denied to the
laſt. It is certain, a Prince ſhould eſteem nothing more precious than
his Word, nothing more ſacred than his Promiſe; which made <hi>Francis</hi>
I. of <hi>France</hi> ſay, That if Faith was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally baniſhed out of the
World, it ſhould be found in his Word. Indeed a Prince ſhould be careful of
promiſing any thing that may be of Damage to him, and where the Thing
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed cannot without good Reaſon bind to the Performance; and whether
what the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to thoſe Commiſſioners were of that ſort, I
will not undertake to determine.</p>
            <p>When the King had ſettled his Court at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
recruited his Army, and fortified his Garriſons in all Parts, he gave
<hi>Banbury,</hi> and that Part of the Country, to the Earl of
<hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> who was commanded to raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Horſe,
which was given to the Lord <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0319800400:114"/> 
               <hi>Compton,</hi> his
eldeſt Son, and Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> his ſecond Son, was made Lieutenant
Collonel of it: To Sir <hi>William Compton,</hi> his third Son, was given the
Caſtle of <hi>Banbury:</hi> One Troop in his Regiment of Horſe was given to
Captain <hi>James Chamberlain,</hi> Brother to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was
then High Sheriff of <hi>Oxfordſhire:</hi> To Captain <hi>James
Chamberlain</hi> were given the two Villages of Upper and Lower
<hi>Heigford,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Steeple Aſton,</hi>
in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> for his Quarters, while he raiſed the ſaid
Company. Mr. <hi>Herbert Jeffries,</hi> of <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> was his
Lieutenant, and I was his Cornet. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was ſoon raiſed, and the
firſt Time the Captain went out with it, he was killed near
<hi>Northampton,</hi> by one Captain <hi>Lawſon.</hi> About the ſame time
Mr. <hi>Herbert Jeffries</hi> was ſent for by his Uncle Sir <hi>Herbert
Price,</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fries</hi>'s Father being drowned in paſſing
the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Wye:</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Jeffries</hi> came no more back, and
the Troop of Horſe fell to my Lot, where I continued not long; for the Lord
<hi>Wentworth,</hi> who was Major-General of the Horſe by the Death of Sir
<hi>Thomas Byron,</hi> was alſo made Collonel of the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi>'s Regiment; and being very inquiſitive to find out a young
active Man to be his Adjutant, I was recommended to his Lordſhip, by Mr.
<hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Farmer</hi> (Son to Sir <hi>William Farmer</hi> of
<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi>) who was at that time Cornet
to the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> The great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was, whether I ſhould
quit my Troop, to be his Lordſhip's Adjutant? To which I was 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0319800400:115"/> adviſed by many, aſſuring me by that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I
ſhould know more of the War in one Year, than being a Captain all my
Lifetime; and ſo I quitted my Company, with the good Will of the Earl of
<hi>Northampton,</hi> after I had been at the Battle of <hi>Middleton
Cheney,</hi> near <hi>Banbury,</hi> where we beat the Parliament Troops. Upon
the quitting my Troop, Mr. <hi>George Chamberlain,</hi> another Brother of Sir
<hi>Thomas,</hi> was made Captain of it; and I had not been long with my Lord
<hi>Wentworth,</hi> before my Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> being Lieutenant General of
the Horſe, deſired me to be his Adjutant, which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip could not
refuſe, the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> being his ſuperior General Officer; and in
that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I remained with my Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> to his great
Satisfaction, till his Diſgrace in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> as ſhall be ſaid
hereafter.</p>
            <p>During this Year 1643, I was Adjutant to my Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi>
when he defeated <hi>Waller</hi> at <hi>Roundway-Down,</hi> near the
<hi>Devizes,</hi> took his Cannon, Ammunition, and Baggage, with ſome Foot
Colours and Standards, and <hi>Wallet</hi> himſelf eſcaped to
<hi>Briſtol.</hi> By this Loſs of <hi>Waller</hi>'s, the King was Maſter
of all the Weſt, <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi> being ſoon after
delivered; and if the King had then marched to <hi>London,</hi> he had, in all
Probability, made an End of the War. But he was ill (if not maliciouſly)
perſwaded, to beſiege <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> which was the only Place left
to the Parliament in theſe Parts. The King had Intentions of Storming it, but
fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loſe the beſt Part of his Infantry in that <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0319800400:116"/> Action, and being aſſured it could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, made the
King loſe much Time, and the Opportunity of taking it: For the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> ſoon raiſed an Army in <hi>London,</hi> for its Relief;
to prevent which, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> were
ſent with all the Horſe, to ſtop his Paſſage, or at leaſt to retard
his March through <hi>Oxfordſhire:</hi> And tho' the Prince had then a brave
Army, and was moſt commonly in a Race Campagne, and that we ſtill marched
before <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to eat up the Proviſions, and to attend his
Motions, yet we took no Advantage of him, nor was his Deſign of raiſing the
Siege of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> prevented, tho' it was then in the laſt
Extremity. When <hi>Eſſex</hi> came upon the Brow of the Hills, not far
diſtant from <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> he diſcharged ſome Cannon, to give
them Notice of his Coming, and the King hereupon raiſed the Siege, without
any Loſs or Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Town. Thus, when the King's Affairs were in
a proſperous Condition, he trifled away Time to no Purpoſe in that
unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Siege. When <hi>Eſſex</hi> had put the City of
<hi>Glouceſter</hi> in Order, and left them Cannon and Ammunition, he marched
unexpectedly to <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> which he ſurprized, and ſent from
thence great Stores of all Sorts of Proviſion, which the King ſent thither
from his Camp; and <hi>Eſſex</hi> likewiſe took in <hi>Tewksbury</hi> two
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Horſe, with divers Officers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>Nicholas
Criſp;</hi> from whence he marched towards <hi>London,</hi> by the way of
<hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerford</hi> and <hi>Newbury,</hi> where was the firſt
<hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> 
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0319800400:117"/> Fight; but ſince I was not preſent
in that Battle, I will not pretend to give a Relation of it: Only this I may
ſay truly, that we ſtaked there Pearls againſt Pebbles, and loſt ſome
Men there of great Conſideration, tho' the Enemy loſt more Soldiers, and
were obliged to quit their Station; and in this Year 43, the King was ſo
ſucceſsful, that the Parliament began to deſpair, and the prevailing
Party in the Houſe of Commons were ready to truſs up Bag and Baggage: But
<hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Succeſs at <hi>Glouceſter</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Scene of
publick Affairs, and the King returned to <hi>Oxford.</hi> It was about this
time that the Earls of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> deſerted the
Parliament, and came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to ſubmit themſelves to the King:
But they not being received nor countenanced as they expected, they both
returned again to the Parliament: When the King ought moſt certainly to have
received them well, and to have uſed them kindly, for Encouragement to
others. But our unfortunate Prince was ſtill adviſed to take falſe
Meaſures, in Affairs that moſt nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him. Upon their firſt
Coming, there was a Debate in Council, by the King's Order, how they ſhould
be received? Some thought his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould receive them very
graciouſly, and with kind Expreſſions of his Acceptance of their Return
to his Service, and that the Behaviour of all others towards them, ſhould be
ſuch as might make them think themſelves very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, without taking
Notice of any thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done amiſs by them: But others, of a 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0319800400:118"/> contrary Judgment, would not have them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the
King's Preſence. Betwixt theſe Extremes, others were of Opinion, they
ſhould neither be neglected nor courted, but admitted to kiſs the King and
Queen's Hands. But the Reaſon of old <hi>Fabius</hi> ought to have been
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which he gave in the Caſe of <hi>Coſſius Altinius,</hi>
who, after the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
fled to <hi>Hannibal</hi>; and when the Condition of the <hi>Romans</hi>
mended, he came again to them. Hereupon many thought he ſhould be eſteemed
as a common Enemy, and ſent back to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as a perfidious
Perſon; but <hi>Fabius</hi> reprehended their Severity as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
who judged in the Heat of War, as in the Time of Peace, and told them, their
chief Care ought to be, that none of their Friends ſhould forſake them, and
next, that they who had forſaken them, might return to their Obedience and
Protection, and be well uſed: Which Method ſhould have been taken with
theſe two Earls, which had prevented their Return, and encouraged others to
follow them.</p>
            <p>But it was the unhappy Temper of thoſe who were often called to
Council in this King's Time, that Reſolutions taken upon full Debate, were
ſeldom proſecuted with equal Reſolution, but often changed upon new and
ſhort Debates; and many Counſellours were irreſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant,
and full of Objections, which much hindred good Reſolutions. And the great
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune was, that the King moſt commonly <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0319800400:119"/>
conſidered more the Perſon that ſpoke, as he was in his Grace or
Prejudice, than the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel it ſelf; and always ſuſpected, or at
leaſt truſted leſs to his own Judgment than he ought to have done, which
rarely deceived him ſo much as that of other Men: And if in the Caſe
aforementioned, he had followed his own Judgment, he had received and uſed
thoſe Lords very kindly. But at this time the King's Affairs were in a
flouriſhing Condition, and it was the unlucky Temper of the King's Party, to
be the moſt deſperately caſt down upon the leaſt ill Succeſs, and,
upon any good, to be the moſt elated; and therefore were of Opinion againſt
receiving thoſe Lords with any Civility, believing they returned to the King,
becauſe the Parliament's Affairs were at that time but in a tottering
Condition.</p>
            <p>The King having ſucceſsfully ſettled military Affairs the
laſt Year, and the Parliament fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a farther Encreaſe of them, called
to their Aſſiſtance their Brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> in Purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of
their wicked League and Covenant; which ſecond Voyage of theirs into
<hi>England,</hi> brought that Deluge of Miſchiefs which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
followed; for, in the Beginning of the Year 44, the King's Affairs begun to
change Face, for <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> were ſoon recruited
at <hi>London,</hi> and by the Help of other aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Counties, they
raiſed two powerful Armies, marched into <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> hovering
about the King's Head Quarters, who not liking ſuch Neighbours, had a Mind to
draw them from <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0319800400:120"/> thence, and therefore left
<hi>Oxford.</hi> Upon this the Enemy was ordered to follow the King, leaving
his evil Counſellours unmoleſted in <hi>Oxford,</hi> contrary to what they
had always till then pretended, that their Deſign was only to remove the evil
Counſellours; but now it plainly appeared, that their Deſign was againſt
the King's ſacred Perſon, ſince both Armies followed him, which being too
great to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long together, they ſeparated, and <hi>Eſſex</hi> was
perſwaded by the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> and others, to reduce the Weſtern
Counties to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Parliament, and that <hi>Waller,</hi> with
his Army, ſhould attend the King's Motions, who was marching, as the Enemy
thought, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Wales:</hi> But the King gave <hi>Waller</hi> the Go-by,
and having gotten before him, was marching to <hi>Daventry</hi> in great
Diligence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left a ſtrong Guard of Dragoons at <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predy</hi>
Bridge (a Paſs over the <hi>Charwell</hi> between both Armies)
<hi>Waller</hi> being on the other Side the River, waiting the King; and
perceiving the Guard was drawn off from <hi>Cropredy</hi> Bridge, and that the
Van of the King's Army was much before their Rear, the Van having marched
faſter than was neceſſary; ſo that the Rear of the King's were but then
come to their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, and were not advanced ſo far as the Bridge, which
the King's Guard had quitted. <hi>Waller</hi> taking this Advantage, paſſed
over a great Part of his Army at this Bridge, under the Command of Collonel
<hi>Weems,</hi> who was General of the Artillery, with ſeveral Cannon 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0319800400:121"/> of <hi>Weems</hi>'s Invention, being more eaſy of
Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and this great Detachment of <hi>Waller</hi>'s Army was drawn up
juſt in the Way where the Rear of the King's Army was to paſs, which was
commanded by the old Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> who was of Neceſſity
obliged to fight the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,. before he could get to the Van of the King's
Army; the whole Army of <hi>Waller</hi> being drawn up on the other Side the
River, to paſs the Bridge, in Caſe <hi>Weems</hi> ſucceeded, of which
<hi>Waller</hi> doubted not, having paſſed over many more Troops than the
Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi> had in the Rear. However, the Earl behaved
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well in that Engagement, that, after a very ſharp Diſpute,
the Enemy was beaten, and forced over <hi>Cropredy</hi> Bridge, to join their
Army. Many were killed upon the Place, and many Priſoners taken, with all
their Cannon and Ammunition, and, amongſt the Priſoners, <hi>Weems,</hi> a
<hi>Scot,</hi> and the King's ſworn Servant, being made Maſter-Gunner of
<hi>England,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Employment; and beſides, he had a good
Sum of Money given him, for the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making thoſe Leather Cannon.
After the Battle, he was was brought before the King, and had the Impudence to
tell his Majeſty, in his <hi>Scotch</hi> Tone, That, in good Faith, his Heart
was always towards his Majeſty. This Victory was not obtained without ſome
Loſs on our Side, for Sir <hi>William Boteler,</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil-William
Clark,</hi> both Collonels of Horſe, were killed, and much regretted, being
brave Men. We had there a Regiment of Dragoons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0319800400:122"/> by Collonel <hi>Hooper,</hi> who ſignalized himſelf upon this
Occaſion ſo well, that tho' he was of a mean Education, and ſmall
Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet ſuch particular Notice was taken of him by the Earl of
<hi>Cleveland,</hi> who gave ſo good an Account of his Service that Day, that
the King gave him the Honour of Knighthood, by the Name of Sir <hi>Thomas
Hooper,</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to follow his Example. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat made
<hi>Waller</hi> haſten to <hi>London</hi> for Recruits, and the King taking
Advantage of his Retreat, turned again with his Army, and marched with great
Diligence after the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was gone into the
Weſt.</p>
            <p>While the King was upon his March, he had an Account, that
<hi>York</hi> was beſieged by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were joined with
<hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>; upon which Information, the King
ſent Orders to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> to join with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s Army, to raiſe that Siege, which the Prince did; but
not content with that, he would needs follow the Enemy, with whom he fought
upon <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> four Miles from <hi>York,</hi> and had defeated
the Enemy, diſordered their main Battle, poſſeſs'd their Cannon, and
forced their three Generals out of the Field; but being too furious in
purſuing his Advantage, and his Soldiers too buſy in Pillaging,
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> who then commanded the Horſe under <hi>Mancheſter,</hi>
having rallied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Troops, charged the Prince, and preſſed him
ſo hard, that he changed the whole Fortune of the Day, and forced the Prince
to a <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0319800400:123"/> diſorderly Flight, and gained an entire Victory,
and took Priſoners Major General <hi>George Porter,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles
Lucas,</hi> Collonel <hi>Tybiard,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others. This Defeat was
infinitely preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the King's Affairs in the North, the Loſs of
<hi>York</hi> ſoon following it, and many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections were made upon the
Prince's Fighting, which he ſhould not have done, his Buſineſs only
having been to raiſe the Siege of <hi>York.</hi> Hereupon the Marqueſs of
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> with ſeveral other eminent Officers in the North, being
highly diſſatisfied with the Prince, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>England,</hi> and went to
<hi>Hamburgh,</hi> whereby the whole North was ſoon after loſt. The King
having received an Account of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat in his March, haſtened the more
after <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and being come into a Race Campagne in
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> three or four Miles only from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and General
<hi>Goring</hi> being newly come from the North, after the Defeat of
<hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> and was then with the King in the Head of his Army,
the Van of which was that Day commanded by the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> Major
General, and the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> Lieutenant General, brought up the Rear
of the Army with his own Brigade; and being ready to go to Prayers, Mr.
<hi>Elliot,</hi> of the King's Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, came to his Lordſhip, and told
him, the King would ſpeak with him: To which the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi>
replied, <hi>You ſee I am juſt going to Prayers, I will ſerve God
firſt, and then I ſhall ſerve the King the better after, and will
preſently wait upon the King after Prayers:</hi> 
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0319800400:124"/> Which
being ended, as his Lordſhip was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up to the King, Sir <hi>Edward
Sydenham,</hi> Knight-Marſhal, came riding down the Hill, with ſeveral
Gentlemen, and told the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> that the King commanded him to be
his Priſoner. His Lordſhip being ſomewhat ſurprized with this
Meſſage, turned his Horſe, and I aſked him, what Service he would
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me? To which his Lordſhip preſently replied, <hi>I can command you
nothing, being a Priſoner; but I pray you acquaint the Lord</hi> Wentworth
<hi>with my preſent Condition</hi>; which I did, who was much ſurprized
with it, and ſo were all the other General Officers to whom I told it; and
they all concluded it was the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of General <hi>Goring</hi>'s coming to
the King. The Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> forthwith alighted, with ſeveral other
principal Officers, to conſider what Meaſures to take, in ſo ſudden and
unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Change, and were all much unſatisfied, believing General
<hi>Goring</hi> to be the Cauſe, of whom they had no good Opinion, ſince
his Examination in Parliament, at the Beginning of the War, when he was
Governour of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> which he ſoon delivered, and made good
Conditions for his going into <hi>France,</hi> after he had received Money on
both Sides, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to neither. Upon this Conſideration, the General
Officers of Horſe were ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied with the Change, that
they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drew up an Addreſs to the King, which was penned by Mr.
<hi>Adrian Scroop,</hi> the Subſtance of which was, as I well remember, as
followeth. <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0319800400:125"/> 
               <hi>That they, the Lord</hi> Wentworth,
<hi>and other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Officers of the Army, having had the Honourlong to
ſerve his Majeſty under the Command of the Lord</hi> Wilmot, <hi>were ſo
well and intimately acquainted with all his Concerns relating to the Army, that
they were confident he could be guilty of no Crime but what they muſt know;
and that finding his Lordſhip ſuddenly diſgraced, and fallen into his
Majeſty's Diſpleaſure, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt humbly begged his Majeſty
would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſe to let them know what Fault the Lord</hi> Wilmot
<hi>had committed, that they might free themſelves from it, or moſt humbly
implore the King's Pardon for it.</hi> This Addreſs was preſented to the
King by the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> accompanied with ſeveral General
Officers, and others of the Army. I was then preſent, when the King, having
firſt read the Addreſs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, gave this verbal Anſwer, which I
heard the King ſay. <hi>That if the Lord</hi> Wilmot <hi>had continued to
command his Army of Horſe, his Crown could not have long ſtood upon his
Head;</hi> and he aſſured the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and thoſe Officers
with him, that when the Buſineſs was over with the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> (with whom he was now engaged) we ſhould all know what
Fault the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> had committed: That, in the <hi>Interim</hi> his
Majeſty was well ſatisfied of their Loyalty, who had preſented that
Addreſs, and commanded them to go to their ſeveral Brigades and Regiments,
and to obey General <hi>Goring,</hi> whom he had made General of all his
Cavalry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0319800400:126"/>Hereupon General <hi>Goring</hi> went to the
Head of the Horſe, to command a Thouſand to be drawn out; but not finding
the Lord <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> nor the Adjutant General, he returned to the
King, and complained, he could find no General Officer, or Adjutant, to draw
out a Party: Whereupon the King aſked for me (who every Night brought his
Majeſty the Liſt of the Quarters) and ſent <hi>Tomkins,</hi> an Equerry,
to find me, and bring me to his Majeſty, which he ſoon did; and the King
commanded me to go with General <hi>Goring,</hi> and obey his Orders: And
accordingly I forthwith drew out a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of One Thouſand Horſe, under
the Conduct of Collonel <hi>Richard Nevil,</hi> of <hi>Billing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beer</hi> in
<hi>Berkſhire.</hi> The General was pleaſed with my Diligence, in ſo
ſoon drawing out the Detachment, and commanded me to come with him, and told
me, he made me that Day his Adjutant; and that I being the firſt Man that the
King had recommended to him, he would take particular Care of me, and
aſſured me, that whenever Collonel <hi>Scrimſour,</hi> an old
<hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that was Adjutant-General, died, he would make me
Adjutant-General; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſoon after, and then I was made
Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant-General of all the Horſe that were, or ſhould be raiſed in the
Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Town of
<hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> for ſo my Commiſſion ran. But,
leaving this Digreſſion, I muſt not omit to tell, that General
<hi>Goring</hi> being advanced to the Top of the Hill, about two Miles before
our Army, <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0319800400:127"/> had there a perfect View of the Enemy, who
were then about <hi>Leſtwythiel.</hi> He ſtopp'd then, and ſent me back
in great Haſte to the King, to tell him in what Poſture the Enemy was,
deſiring the King to advance with his Army without Delay, and that he would
make good the Poſt where he was, which would be very advantageous for his
Majeſty's Army. In the mean time that I went from General <hi>Goring</hi> to
the King, he commanded Collonel <hi>Nevil</hi> to ſend a Party towards
<hi>Buconnock,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mohun</hi>'s Houſe, where perhaps a further
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery might be made of the Enemy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Collonel <hi>Nevil</hi>
ſent out a Party under the Command of Monſieur <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> a
<hi>Florentine,</hi> who meeting ſome Country-Men, he aſked them, if they
knew any thing of the Enemy? Who told him, if he made Haſte to the Lord
<hi>Mohun</hi>'s Houſe, he would find there ſome of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Officers at Dinner, not believing the King's Army was ſo near them. Whereupon
the Party haſtened thither, and ſurprized ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers, whom they
brought Priſoners; for which Service, and ſome others after, he was
Knighted, and known by the Name of Sir <hi>Bernard Gaſcoigne,</hi> and was
made Major to General <hi>Goring</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, and ſerved not
only to the End of the War in very good Eſteem, but was alſo at the
Riſing in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and condemned to be ſhot to Death at
<hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> with Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George
Liſle;</hi> but being a Foreigner, he was reprieved, and ſaved. And now I
will tell the Reaſons <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0319800400:128"/> why I appointed Collonel
<hi>Nevil</hi> to command this Detachment of a Thouſand Horſe, tho' it was
not his Turn to go. Whilſt the Addreſs from the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> and
the General Officers was making to the King, his Lordſhip commanded me to go
to ſuch Collonels of Horſe in the Army, to deſire their Agreeing and
Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Addreſs: And when I told Collonel <hi>Nevil</hi> of it, he
ſaid, he was as great a Servant to the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> and had as good
an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him as any Perſon in the Army, well knowing that his
Lordſhip had long and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerved the King; but yet, whoever the
King ſhould ſet over him, he would obey: And added, that he thought not
fit, at that Time eſpecially, to diſpute the King's Commands, when they
were going to attack the Enemy; and that therefore he would have no Hand in the
Addreſs, and deſired the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> to excuſe him: And it
was upon this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I choſe Collonel <hi>Nevil</hi> to
command that Detachment, tho' I knew it was not his Turn to go; in which he
acted to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's great Satisfaction, who had ever after a great Eſteem
and Value for him.</p>
            <p>At my Return to the King with the Meſſage of General
<hi>Goring,</hi> the King forthwith marched with his Army towards him, who not
only made good the Poſt where he was, but, upon the Earl of
<hi>Brentford</hi>'s drawing and advancing farther, (who then commanded the
Army in chief under the King) and reviewing the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of
<hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army, which then began to <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0319800400:129"/> retire
towards <hi>Foy,</hi> the King's Army did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon advance nearer the Enemy,
and the King's General Head Quarters were ſettled at <hi>Bucon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Mohun</hi>'s Houſe, and Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil</hi> was ordered,
with ſome Regiments of Foot, to fix them at the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi>'s
Houſe, a ſtrong Quarters oppoſite to the King's, on the other Side the
Valley; at the Head of which Valley a ſtrong Guard of Horſe was ordered to
be conſtantly kept, to keep in the Enemy; our whole Army being encamped on
both Sides the Valley, which prevented the Enemy from making any Excurſion
that Way. But, becauſe the reſt of <hi>Cornwal</hi> behind the Enemy was
open, it was thought neceſſary to ſend a ſtrong Detachment thither, to
ſtop their Paſſage on that Side. Whereupon General <hi>Goring</hi> was
ſent with the greateſt Part of the Horſe to St. <hi>Blaſe</hi> Bridge,
which was the only Paſſage by which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could enlarge their Quarters
on that Side. Sir <hi>Thomas Baſſet,</hi> a <hi>Corniſh</hi> Man, was
likewiſe ſent thither with his Tertia of Foot, and I was with his
Excellency. The Enemy, by this Diſpoſition of our Army, finding they were
encompaſſed on all Sides, and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to break through
with their whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, without apparent Ruine, reſolved to chuſe the
leaſt Evil, and that their Horſe, being about Two Thouſand, ſhould
attempt in the Night to break thro' the Valley between both Armies, which
ſucceeding, they might march with great Diligence, and paſs the River at
<hi>Saltaſh,</hi> before our Army could overtake them, <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0319800400:130"/>
and ſo get to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and that <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould take
Shipping at <hi>Foy,</hi> and meet his Horſe at <hi>Plymouth</hi>; and that
Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> who commanded the Infantry, ſhould ſtay
with them, to defend them as long as he could, and at laſt make Articles for
them, being caught in a Net. This Reſolution being taken, it was put in
Execution the next Night; and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Goring</hi> being at St.
<hi>Blaſe,</hi> a Soldier from the King's Quarters, for Orders brought a
Letter without any Seal, written in great Haſte by the King himſelf, in
theſe Words: <hi>Goring, the Enemy have, this Night paſt, broke thro' our
Quarters with their Horſe, after ſome Reſiſtance made by our Horſe
Guard commanded by</hi> Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>who was not able to hinder their
Paſſage, being near five times his Number. They were like to have
ſurprized Sir</hi> Edward Waldgrave<hi>'s Brigade in their Paſſage; but
he having ſome Notice of their March, prevented them. They are gone in great.
Haſte, without Bag or Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, towards</hi> Saltaſh, <hi>commanded by
Sir</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Balfour. <hi>Some of our Horſe are gone to ſtop their
Paſſage at</hi> Saltaſh, <hi>if it be poſſible: You muſt therefore
immediately march after them with all your Horſe, and leave</hi> Butler
<hi>with the Foot to keep St.</hi> Blaſe <hi>Bridge.</hi> The General got his
Army together forthwith, and marched after the Enemy with great Diligence, but
was told by ſome Troops that followed them from the King's Quarters, that it
was impoſſible to overtake them, they being returned upon that Account.
Upon this Information, which the <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0319800400:131"/> General had from ſome
conſiderable Officers, who had followed the Enemy to no Purpoſe, his
Excellency thought fit to return, and ſent the Horſe to their Quarters, and
went to tell the King, he had been able to do nothing of what he had commanded.
The General then ſtayed with the King, where Orders were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with given
concerning the Enemy's Infantry; and upon Aſſurance that the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> with the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> and ſeveral others, were
gone by Sea to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and that their Foot Army began early in the
Morning to retire towards <hi>Foy,</hi> in Hopes to find Ships there to
tranſport them to their General <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth:</hi> The
King's Army hereupon, being in their Rear, preſſed them ſo cloſe, that
they were forced to fight from Hedge to Hedge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an incloſed Country;
and tho' they were many times put to a diſorderly Retreat, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they
fought till the Night parted us. The next Morning early Major General
<hi>Skippon</hi> ſent Collonel <hi>Butler</hi> to deſire a Parly, which
being accepted, and Hoſtages delivered, the Treaty began that Morning in the
King's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Articles were ſoon agreed upon, all Arms, Cannon and
Ammunition, to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with their Carriages. We took Fifty Pieces of
Braſs Cannon, Three Hundred Barrels of Powder, with Match and Ball
proportionable, Seven Hundred Carriages, between Nine and Ten Thouſand Arms,
and many common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers deſerted, and thoſe who ſtayed, marched off
only with Sticks in their Hands; but all <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0319800400:132"/> Collonels and
Field Officers were on Horſeback, with their Swords only, with Major General
<hi>Skippon</hi> in the Head of the Army, who carried his Loſs with a very
good Grace, and they were to be conducted to <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Thomas Bulſtrode,</hi> my Couſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, had
there a Foot Regiment, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with General <hi>Goring,</hi> that, if
I could diſengage him from that Service, he ſhould be well received, and
have the ſame Command in our Army: And, in order to this, I accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him
two Days, and ſhewed him all the Kindneſs I could, and uſed my beſt
Endeavours to take him off from that Party; but he was ſo bigotted, and
ſeduced by the Zealots of that Army, that I could prevail nothing with him,
who told me plainly, he was reſolved to ſuffer with his Brethren (as he
called them) rather than to quit them, or accept of any Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I could
offer him: And added, that his Father was Governour of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> and
had raiſed at his own Expences two Regiments for the Parliament, and that he
was reſolved to run the ſame Fortune with the reſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, and
therefore deſired I would not preſs him farther in that againſt which he
had taken a final Reſolution; and ſo I left him as I found him, wilful,
ſtubborn, and full of rebellious Principles.</p>
            <p>This Defeat of their Army in <hi>Cornwal</hi> was certainly of
very great Conſequence; for, tho' their Horſe eſcaped, yet moſt of
their Foot were deſtroyed by their long and tedious March 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0319800400:133"/> thro' an Enemy's Country, wanting Proviſions and
Neceſſaries, eſpecially thro' <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi>
which were great Enemies to them, and all our Army of Horſe marching at the
ſame time near them, towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> and our Infantry followed; ſo
that the Country People would ſcarce give them Proviſions for Money. They
found the ſame alſo in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> the Country People being
uſually for the ſtrongeſt Party, and the King's Affairs at that time run
very ſmoothly: And tho' the Parliament Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did always leſſen their
Defeats, and enlarge their Victories, yet this Loſs of theirs was ſo
viſible, that it gave great Reputation to the King's Affairs, and many
ſcurvy Reflections were made upon <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s leaving the Army,
which did proceed (as was publickly ſaid) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Fear or Cowardice,
neither of which was believed by thinking Men, knowing that the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> durſt fight, and had fought, and very well deſerved of
the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore they were rather of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that
<hi>Eſſex</hi> finding more of their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who managed the great
Deſign in the Houſe of Commons, than was at firſt imparted to him, he
ſaw no Way would bring the leading Members in both Houſes to a Compliance
with the King, in thoſe peaceable Propoſitions his Majeſty made to them,
by his Letters, not only after <hi>Waller</hi>'s Defeat at <hi>Cropredy,</hi>
but after his ſignal Victory in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> than by keeping things as
near as his Excellency could, in an equal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. However, it was generally
known, that <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0319800400:134"/> there were great Deſigns againſt
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> many being very deſirous to remove him from his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of General, upon their Jealouſy that he was too much inclined to Peace, tho'
we found no ſuch thing from him, neither had the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any Reaſon to
believe it; for, by raiſing the Siege of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> which
<hi>Eſſex</hi> had done with great Dexterity, he did the Parliament ſo
great Service, that they could never ſufficiently acknowledge it; that Siege
having been one of the greateſt Misfortunes that happened to King
<hi>Charles,</hi> during the War; and thoſe who adviſed the King to it,
either thro' Ignorance or Malice, did more Miſchief to the King's Affairs,
than the greateſt of his Enemies: For if the King had marched towards
<hi>London,</hi> when he ſat down before <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> he had, in
all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Appearance, made an End of the War. But this King was very ill
ſerved in his Wars, thro' too much Fire and Heat in ſome of his Generals,
by their frequent Factions among themſelves, wherein the King found
Difficulty enough to reconcile them, even where he was in Perſon, and divers
ſudden Changes were made afterwards, which proved very diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to
the King. This was the Time, when really thoſe that wiſhed well to the
King, yet ſacrificed his Security to their Animoſities againſt each
other, without any Deſign of Treachery, but to the King's irreparable
Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: A Time, in which Want of Diſcretion produced as much Miſchief as
the moſt plain Villainy; for the King ſuffered as much by 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0319800400:135"/> the Faction of his Counſellours, by their not
foreſeeing what was evident, and by their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of what was not like
to be; they often deliberated too long without Reſolution, and as often
reſolved without deliberating, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver executed rigorouſly what was
reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and all went to wreck by Negligence, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency, and
Dejection of Spirit. It was in this Year that the Queen was delivered at
<hi>Exeter</hi> of the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> who was put into
the Hands of the Lady <hi>Dalkeith</hi>; after which the Queen took Shipping at
<hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennis</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and arrived ſafely in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the King left <hi>Buconnock</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi>
ſeveral Addreſſes were made to him in the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi>'s Behalf;
but the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> being then Secretary of State, ſtill delayed the
Buſineſs; the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> in the mean time, being firſt ſent
Priſoner to <hi>Exeter,</hi> from thence to <hi>Barnſtable.</hi> At laſt,
upon the King's being daily importuned in that Affair, the Lord <hi>Digby</hi>
gave this Anſwer from the King, and that they were to expect no other, which
was as follows. <hi>That, upon the Earl of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s marching
into</hi> Cornwal, <hi>it was reſolved at a Cabinet Council, where the
Lord</hi> Wilmot <hi>was, That the King ſhould write with his own Hand to the
Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>offering him what Conditions he pleaſed, if he
would lay down his Arms, come to the King, and leave his Army to the King's
Mercy; and it was preciſely ordered by the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that no Perſon
ſhould take Notice of that</hi> 
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0319800400:136"/> 
               <hi>Letter, or ſend
any Meſſage to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex: <hi>That, notwithſtanding this
particular Command of the King's, the Lord</hi> Wilmot <hi>bid him that carried
the Letter, to remember his Service to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex,
<hi>deſiring he would lay hold of the Opportunity then offered, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him the King ſhould make good his Word, and that he</hi> (<hi>the Lord</hi>
Wilmot) <hi>would take Care the Courtiers ſhould not hinder it, nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
things as they had done.</hi> Upon this Anſwer the Officers gave over their
Purſuit of any farther Addreſſes, and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> was no
farther queſtioned, but went into <hi>France</hi> at the End of the War, and
was the chief Perſon that ſaved the Life of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. after
his Defeat at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and carried him ſafe into
<hi>France,</hi> and was in great Eſteem with that King, even to his Death;
and his Diſgrace under King <hi>Charles</hi> I. was look'd upon purely as an
Effect of the Power General <hi>Goring</hi> had at that time with the King, who
had certainly all <hi>Wilmot</hi>'s Faults, but wanted his Regularity, and
preſerving his Reſpects with the Officers. <hi>Wilmot</hi> always ſhut
Debauchery out of his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, never neglected that, and ſo rarely
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in it: <hi>Goring</hi> had a ſharper Wit, and much a keener
Courage and Preſence of Mind in Danger, in which <hi>Wilmot</hi> could not
behave himſelf ſo well, and therefore warily declined it, as he did near
<hi>Southam,</hi> at the Beginning of the War, when the King was near
<hi>Coventry,</hi> before his Standard was ſet up; and for miſſing that
Opportunity of Fighting, his Lordſhip <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0319800400:137"/> was much blamed.
<hi>Wilmot</hi> never drank, when he was within Diſtance of an Enemy, and
<hi>Goring</hi> ſeldom or never refuſed it, and could not reſiſt
Temptations; and therefore he had always much Company, and few Friends, and he
loved no Man ſo well, but he would cozen him, and then laugh at him for being
cozened.</p>
            <p>About this Time, General <hi>Goring</hi> was ſent for with his
Forces to the King, and upon his firſt coming, lying at <hi>Bampton in the
Buſh,</hi> he defeated the Enemy, which gave him ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that he
was ſent into the Weſt with full Power as Generaliſſimo, and General of
all the Horſe of <hi>England.</hi> His Excellency then went to
<hi>Taunton,</hi> and beſieged it, which Place was reduced to ſome
Neceſſity, when Collonel <hi>Graves</hi> came to relieve it: Whereupon the
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral drew up the Hills, whilſt <hi>Graves</hi> put ſome Recruits and
Proviſions into the Town. At the ſame time the General ſent Sir <hi>John
Digby,</hi> Major General of the Horſe, with a great Detachment, to fall upon
Collonel <hi>Graves</hi> in his Retreat; in which Action Sir <hi>John
Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> had good Succeſs, and took many Priſoners: But being ſhot in
the Arm, he was ſent to <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> to be cured; but his Arm
gangrened, and he there died, to the great Regret of the Army, and of all that
knew him. So ſoon as <hi>Graves</hi> was retired, General <hi>Goring</hi>
drew down his Army again to beſiege <hi>Taunton,</hi> which put the
Garriſon into greater Conſternation than before, believing the King muſt
have had ſome extraordinary Succeſs, which made our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0319800400:138"/> take thoſe Meaſures. We preſſed them ſo hard,
that we were like to be ſoon Maſters of the Place, but that an unlucky
Accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, of Sir <hi>William Courtney</hi>'s and Collonel
<hi>Thornhill</hi>'s falling foul upon each other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Enemy,
which was a great Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and tho' the Governour, <hi>Blague,</hi>
defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Place very bravely, we were likely to be Maſters of it in a
very little time.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget, that, after the Defeat in
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> the King ſtaying ſome time in the Weſtern Parts,
<hi>Eſſex</hi> got together another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and being joined with
<hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> was then ſo ſtrong, that he
hoped to take his Revenge, and encompaſs the King, who was then going to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> taking <hi>Newbury</hi> in his Way. <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with
his Army, had made his Rendezvous in <hi>Aldermarſton</hi> Park, belonging to
Sir <hi>Humphrey Foſter</hi>; from whence he came more ſuddenly upon us
than we expected, which put us into ſome Confuſion. They attacked us at the
ſame time in ſeveral Places, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Succeſs, being much
ſtronger than we; and when they could not prevail in one Place, they attack'd
us in another, hoping in the End to ſurround us: So that there was fighting
at the ſame time in ſeveral Places, in moſt of which the Enemy prevailed,
and we retired, and were upon the Defenſive in all Parts. Upon the Weſt
Side of <hi>Spine</hi> they preſſed us very hard, where young Sir <hi>John
Greenvil</hi> was poſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a high Riſing Ground, with ſome Foot and
Cannon, with a ſmall Retrenchment before him: <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0319800400:139"/> General
<hi>Goring</hi> being then on that Side, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemy intended to
attack that Place with Horſe and Foot, to prevent which, he reſolved to
charge their Horſe with the Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi>'s Brigade, which was
then drawn up on that Side, which was done accordingly: But the Earl of
<hi>Cleveland</hi> engaging his Perſon too far, was there taken Priſoner,
and then a great Body of the Enemy's Foot advanced in good Order upon Sir
<hi>John Greenvil,</hi> forced him from that Poſt, with the Loſs of ſome
Men and Cannon, and himſelf wounded in the Head with a Sword in this Action.
Upon this Succeſs, the Enemy purſued furiouſly, and the Fight continued
very hot, the Enemy ſtill advancing: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was commanded by General
<hi>Goring,</hi> to bring up the Queen's Regiment of Horſe, which was then in
Reſerve, commanded by Sir <hi>John Cansfield,</hi> who charged them ſo
home, that he ſtopp'd their Career, and obliged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, which gave
ſome breathing Time to our Troops on that Side; but in this Action Sir
<hi>John Cansfield</hi> had one of his Legs ſhot and broken: And while we
were thus fighting on that Side of <hi>Spine, Mancheſter,</hi> with his
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, attacked Mr. <hi>Doleman</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Shaw,</hi> below the
Caſtle, where there was a ſharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement all that Afternoon, and the
Garden was warmly attacked, and as well defended, by the Collonels
<hi>Liſle</hi> and <hi>Thelwell,</hi> with the Help of Sir <hi>Thomas
Hooper</hi>'s Dragoons; and a little before the Evening, Sir <hi>John
Brown,</hi> with the Prince's Regiment of Horſe, charged the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my 
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0319800400:140"/> ſo briſkly, that he obliged them to retreat up the
Hill, with the Loſs of ſome Colours, and two Field Pieces of Cannon. Thus
the Fight continued on all Sides, till the Night parted us. The King ſtayed
in the Field till Midnight, that all our Cannon were drawn within the Walls of
<hi>Dennington</hi> Caſtle, for their Security, and then General
<hi>Goring,</hi> with moſt of the Army, marched that Night towards
<hi>Oxford,</hi> without any Alarm from the Enemy, who durſt not follow us,
and the King went to <hi>Briſtol.</hi> The next Day, after our Retreat,
<hi>Eſſex</hi> poſſeſs'd himſelf very quietly of <hi>Newbury,</hi>
making little Doubt of taking <hi>Dennington</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which was thrice
ſummoned, and as often ſtormed, but without Succeſs; and finding it would
be a Work of Time, and nothing was to be got there but Blows, he retired with
his Army, and quitted <hi>Newbury</hi>; to which Place General <hi>Goring</hi>
ſoon came again, relieved the Caſtle with what was wanting, and brought off
all our Cannon.</p>
            <p>The Parliament finding that <hi>Newbury</hi> was quitted, not only
without, but againſt their Order, and all the Cannon brought away from
<hi>Dennington</hi> Caſtle, tho' the Parliament Armies were more than double
to the Number of the King's, they were much diſpleaſed at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which being joined with great Aſperſions of his ill
Conduct in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> made the Parliament reſolve to new model their
Army, which they would do with great Policy, by Degrees, that the leſs Notice
might be taken <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0319800400:141"/> of it. In order to this, they firſt
made a Self-denying Ordinance (as they called it) that after ſuch a prefixed
Time (which was then declared) no Member of either Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhould enjoy any Office either Civil or Military.</p>
            <p>The Winter following this Year, General <hi>Goring</hi> was
quartered at <hi>Bruton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> at Sir <hi>Charles
Berkeley</hi>'s, a great incloſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the Villages were thick,
and great Store of Forage For Horſe. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was then
quartered at <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> where the Villages are
thin, ſtanding only in the Valleys, ſome Diſtance from each other.
General <hi>Goring</hi> taking this Advantage, ſent out Parties, almoſt
every Night, to beat up the Enemy's Quarters in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> which was
done with ſuch good Succeſs, that in a ſhort time we took many
Priſoners and Colours, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned <hi>Waller</hi> to write this
enſuing Letter to General <hi>Goring. Noble Lord, God's Bleſſing he on
your Heart, you are the jollieſt Neighbour I have ever met with: I wiſh for
nothing more, but an Opportunity to let you know, I would not be behind in this
kind of Courteſy. In the mean time, if your Lordſhip pleaſe to releaſe
ſuch Priſoners as you have of mine, for the like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Quality that I
have of yours, I ſhall eſteem it as a great Civility, being your
Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's moſt Humble and Obedient Servant,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>William Waller.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0319800400:142"/>This Letter was brought by a Trumpeter, who
had been often with us, and was well known to us, and was a good pleaſant
Droll; and whilſt we were at Dinner in the General's Quarters, a Party of
Horſe returned, with five Colours, and ſeveral Priſoners of Collonel
<hi>Popham</hi>'s Regiment, whoſe Quarters were beaten up the Night before.
Upon this the General ſent for the Trumpeter into the Room, where we were at
Dinner, to ſhew him the Colours, and the principal Priſoners: Whereupon the
Trumpeter preſſed his Excellency to diſpatch him back with his Anſwer,
fearing, if he ſhould ſtay longer, that <hi>Waller</hi> himſelf might be
taken, before he, the Trumpeter, could reach <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; and ſo he
was diſpatched with this Anſwer from the General: <hi>That if Sir</hi>
William Waller <hi>had Authority, and could nominate two Officers of Quality,
of his Army, to meet two Officers of the like Quality, of General</hi>
Goring<hi>'s Army, at any convenient Place between both Armies, they ſhould
be empowered to exchange all Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on both Sides, of equal Quality, from
the</hi> Lands-End <hi>in</hi> Cornwal, <hi>to</hi> Portſmouth <hi>in</hi>
Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire: Which Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and
accordingly named Collonel <hi>Ennis,</hi> his Adjutant General, and Major
<hi>Butler,</hi> who was Major to <hi>Waller</hi>'s own Regiment, and deſired
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> might be the Place of Meeting. To this the General
willingly conſented, and ſent a Paſs by the ſame Trumpeter, for the
Perſons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and at the ſame time
nominated me with Sir <hi>Bernard Gaſcoigne,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0319800400:143"/> to his own Regiment, Commiſſioners from his
Excellency: And accordingly a Paſs was ſent us forthwith from Sir
<hi>William Waller,</hi> and the Time appointed for our Meeting at
<hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> to which Place we all came the ſame Day with our
Servants, and Trumpeters with each. The Country People believing we were
appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make a Peace, flocked in great Numbers to <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
where we ſtayed fifteen Days, to releaſe all Priſoners of Quality on both
Sides, from the <hi>Lands-End</hi> in the Weſt, to <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> Sir
<hi>William Waller</hi> ſent us a great Preſent of Wines, which came from
<hi>London,</hi> believing we could have none ſuch elſewhere. We then
appointed all our Priſoners to be brought to <hi>Wareham</hi> in
<hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and all the Priſoners of the Parliament's Side, to
be brought to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire</hi>; and Sir
<hi>Bernard Gaſcoigne</hi> went to <hi>Wareham,</hi> to receive our
Priſoners, and Major <hi>Butler</hi> went to <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> to
receive the Parliament's. Collonel <hi>Ennis</hi> returned to
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> and I came back to <hi>Bruton,</hi> to give the Generals an
Account of what we had done.</p>
            <p>Now, the King having often ſollicited the Parliament for Peace,
even after both his Victories, at <hi>Cropredy</hi> Bridge, and in
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> and the Parliament ſeeing the general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the
People and City of <hi>London</hi> bend that way, that they might ſeem at
leaſt to have the ſame Deſires for the Good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (tho' it
plainly appeared they otherwiſe intended) the Parliament, with the Conſent
of the Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> preſent ſome 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0319800400:144"/> Propoſitions to the King, which they deſire may be
treated on at <hi>Uxbridge:</hi> To which Treaty the King ſoon agreed, when
it was well known the Parliament never intended to come to an Agreement, by
their moſt irrational and unjuſt Demands, which they knew, the King could
neither in Reaſon, Honour, or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, grant; and ſo the Treaty was
ſoon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to the King's great Diſſatisfaction, who then clearly
ſaw, the Parliament was reſolved to proſecute the War againſt him, to
the laſt Extremity.</p>
            <p>About this time, the great Deſigns againſt <hi>Eſſex</hi>
began to appear, who was much ſuſpected by thoſe who deſigned to
deſtroy both Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Miniſtry, and Magiſtracy, and reſolved to
remove the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> from his Command, and took Reſolutions
to put the Self-denying Ordinance in Execution: But <hi>Eſſex,
Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and <hi>Denbigh,</hi> forthwith ſurrendered their
Commiſſions; the ſame did likewiſe the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> their
Admiral, they being all fully perſwaded, by the Parliament's Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that they intended to perpetuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the uſurped Government of
the three Nations, and to make themſelves a free State, under a
Preſbyterian Government. But the Parliament were much miſtaken in their
Policy, and were ſoon deprived of their main Deſign, and quickly loſt all
that Dominion which they ſo eagerly deſired, and ſo long ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, it
being preſently ſnatched out of their Hands, by the Independent Party, who
were <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0319800400:145"/> newly ſprung up out of their own Bowels: For
notwithſtanding their Self-Denying Ordinance, <hi>Cromwell</hi> was
diſpenſed with to hold his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lieutenant General to Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax,</hi> who was made General of their new modelled Army, whoſe firſt
Rendezvous was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where they did their own Buſineſs,
and quite ruined the King's.</p>
            <p>The firſt Succeſs by this new modelled Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was performed by
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> who waſting the Country with a Body of Horſe, fell
unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly upon a Party at <hi>Iſlip</hi> Bridge, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Earl
of <hi>Northampton,</hi> who were defeated, and ſome Priſoners taken, and
the Remainder purſued to <hi>Bleckington Houſe,</hi> four Miles from
<hi>Oxford,</hi> where Collonel <hi>Windebank</hi> was ſettled for ſome
time, with a ſmall Party of Horſe and Foot. <hi>Cromwell</hi> preſently
ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Houſe, which had only a Wall about it; the Governour
forthwith ſurrendered it, and had Articles to retire to <hi>Oxford</hi>;
where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to a Council of War, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and ſhot to
Death, for delivering it ſo ſoon to a Party of Horſe only, when he might
have had ſpeedy Aſſiſtance from <hi>Oxford,</hi> which was but four
Miles from <hi>Bleckington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, General <hi>Goring</hi> was at the Siege of
<hi>Taunton,</hi> of which he was in great Hopes ſoon to be Maſter, (at
leaſt he made us all believe ſo) when he received Letters from the King
(ſome Days before his taking of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>) commanding him to quit
the Siege of <hi>Taunton,</hi> and haſten to him with his Army, 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0319800400:146"/> fearing the Enemy would be too ſtrong for him: To
which I wrote the General's Anſwer to the King, having kept the Copy of it,
which was to this Effect. <hi>That he was certain, in few Days, to be Maſter
of</hi> Taunton, <hi>and ſhould leave that Country free from any Enemy,
excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> Lyme <hi>(which was then, and had been for ſome Time blocked
up;) whereas, if he ſhould leave the Siege, the Enemy would be Maſters of
that Country; and therefore he moſt humbly prayed the King, to forbear any
Engagement, and to be upon the Defenſive, upon the River of</hi> Trent,
<hi>which he might very well do, till the Siege of</hi> Taunton <hi>was ended,
and then he would bring his Army to ſerve the King to his beſt Advantage;
and he did again deſire the King to keep at a Diſtance, and not
engage.</hi> But the taking of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> being a great Loſs to the
Parliament, and of ſuch Advantage to the King, that his Majeſty then wrote
to the Queen, that he might (without being too much ſanguine) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that,
ſince the Rebellion began, his Affairs were never in ſo hopeful a Way; and
indeed the Parliament was then likewiſe of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But this
Letter from the General being intercepted by <hi>Fairfax,</hi> cauſed his
ſudden Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance from his Rendezvous at <hi>Brickhill,</hi> to ſend in great
Haſte for <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was gone into the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi>
upon whoſe Return a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken to engage the King forthwith to a
Battle, before the Loſs of <hi>Taunton,</hi> and that General <hi>Goring</hi>
ſhould arrive with his Army. Now, the King, not having Advice from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0319800400:147"/> 
               <hi>Goring,</hi> by his Letter being intercepted, and
both his and his Soldiers Spirits being much heightened by taking of
<hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and the King hearing the Enemy was advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, a Council was forthwith called at Midnight, where it was reſolved to
give the Enemy Battle the next Day; to which the King then prepared, and had in
all Appearance gained a Victory, if Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> (who was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
before made Lieutenant General of all the King's Armies, in Place of the Earl
of <hi>Brentford</hi>) had not, after his uſual Manner, having defeated the
Enemy's left Wing, purſued furiouſly ſo far, as to leave the Foot naked,
who were ſeverely fallen upon by the Enemy's Reſerve of Horſe, who had
put them in great Diſorder, and the whole Army was almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally broken,
before the Prince came back to to their Relief, tho' the King in Perſon (to
the great Hazard of his Life) did all that poſſibly could be done by
Valour, in rallying his Horſe, and endeavouring to maintain the Battle; but
ſeeing all loſt, the King was forced to fly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Leiceſter,</hi>
for his own Safety, leaving the Enemy wholly Maſters of the Field. The Loſs
of all was Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s purſuing the Horſe, which he had
beaten, whoſe natural Heat and Impatience was ſuch, that he could not
endure the Enemy in View, nor would he believe the Enemy had Courage to endure
his Charge; and thus the Army was engaged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cannon was turned, or
the Ground made choice of, upon which they were to fight: <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0319800400:148"/> So that Courage was only to be relied on, where all Conduct failed.
However, if the King had then gone directly into the Weſt, where he had an
Army ready formed, and People generally devoted to his Service, inſtead of
amuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about forming a new Army in Countries worn out with the
Oppreſſion of his own Troops, and the Licence of their Governours, he might
have given the Enemy a great Interruption, if not reſtored his Affairs. Thus
this fatal Battle of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> fought the 14th of <hi>June,</hi>
proved the entire Ruine of all the King's Affairs. The King, after this Battle,
fled from Place to Place, not well knowing which Way to turn himſelf: At
laſt he came to <hi>Newark,</hi> where he received a new Mortification from
his Subjects then in Arms for him, much ſharper than any he had received from
the Enemy, which he ſuffered with more Grief and Perplexity of Mind. Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> after the Loſs of the Weſt and
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> were at <hi>Belvoir</hi> Caſtle, where the King commanded
them to ſtay, and not to follow him to <hi>Newark</hi>; but, contrary to the
King's Commands, they both came thither, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> told his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, he was come to give an Account of the Loſs of <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
and to clear himſelf from thoſe Imputations that had been caſt upon him
for the Surrender of that Place. Tho' the King was diſpleaſed with the
Prince's coming thither, contrary to his Orders, he was yet reſolved to hear
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Defence, who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the King to hold
<hi>Briſtol</hi> at leaſt four Months, <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0319800400:149"/> and yet gave
it up almoſt in as few Days: And he told Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> that he did
really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Prince had no Deſign againſt his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that he
would command a Declaration to be drawn up, by which the Prince ſhould be
abſolved from any Diſloyalty, either in that, or any other Action of the
War; but that in Truth he could not abſolve him of Indiſcretion in the
Delivery of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> The King reſolved to retreat from
<hi>Newark</hi> towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> becauſe the Enemy were on the North
Side of <hi>Trent,</hi> but he imparted his Reſolution to none; except to two
or three of the neareſt Truſt about him; and finding great Differences grow
betwixt Sir <hi>Richard Willis,</hi> the Governour, and the Gentlemen of the
Country, who were firm to him, and whoſe Intereſt alone had preſerved
that Place; and finding no Way to preſerve that Garriſon, but by Removal of
the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he ſent for him into his Bed-chamber, and after many gracious
Expreſſions of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he had received in his Service, he told
him, his Deſign was to go that Night, and to take him with him, and to make
him Captain of his Guards, in Place of the Earl of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> who
was lately killed near <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and would leave Collonel
<hi>Bellaſis</hi> Governour there, who being allied to moſt of the Gentry
of the adjacent Counties, would be more acceptable to them; and that he could
not give a more ample Juſtification of his Services, and of his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in them, than by the Honour and Truſt he conferred upon him. Sir <hi>Richard
Willis</hi> 
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0319800400:150"/> appeared much troubled, and excuſed his
taking the other Command, as a Place of too great Honour, and that his Fortune
could not maintain him in that Employment, and ſaid, his Enemies would
triumph in his Removal. The King told him, he would take Care and provide for
his Support, and ſo went out of his Chamber to Church; and after his Return,
being at Dinner, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> Lord
<hi>Gerard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Willis,</hi> with about Twenty Officers of
the Garriſon, came into the Preſence-Chamber, where Sir <hi>Richard
Willis</hi> addreſſed himſelf to the King, and told him, it was the
publick Talk of the Town, that he was diſgraced, and turned out from his
Government; and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> added, Sir <hi>Richard Willis</hi> was
to be removed from his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for no other Fault, but for being his
Friend. The Lord <hi>Gerard</hi> ſaid, it was a Plot of the Lord
<hi>Digby,</hi> who was a Traitor, and he would prove him to be ſo. The King
was ſo much ſurprized at theſe extravagant and inſolent Diſcourſes,
that he roſe from Dinner in great Diſorder, and retiring into his
Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, he called Sir <hi>Richard Willis</hi> to follow him, who
anſwered loudly, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a publick Injury, and expected a
publick Satisfaction. This ſo provoked his Majeſty, that, with much greater
Indignation than ever he was ſeen poſſeſſed with, he commanded them
to depart his Preſence, and to come no more into it; and this with ſuch
Circumſtances in his Looks and Geſture, as well as Words, that 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0319800400:151"/> they appeared no leſs confounded, and departed the
Room, aſhamed of what they had done: Yet ſo ſoon as they came to the
Governour's Houſe, they ſounded to Horſe, intending to be preſently
gone; but ſoon after they ſent to the King for Paſſes, who gave them
ſuch as they deſired, and ſent them, and declared Collonel
<hi>Bellaſis</hi> Governour of <hi>Newark,</hi> but forgot at the ſame time
to have hanged up Sir <hi>Richard Willis,</hi> for his inſolent Carriage
towards his Sovereign.</p>
            <p>After this the King went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſent ſeveral
Meſſages for Peace, and for a preſent Treaty; that he would come to
<hi>London,</hi> and put himſelf into their Hands: But nothing would be
accepted. And tho' he tried to deal with the Independants, yet it was in vain;
the King's ill Succeſs run on in a continued Series, in this Year 1645, he
loſt more in three Months than he had gotten before in three Years. The
<hi>French</hi> ſeemed glad of theſe Diſorders amongſt us, Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu</hi> having had an implacable Malice and Hatred to
<hi>England,</hi> ever ſince the Iſle of <hi>Rhee</hi> Voyage, and the
declared Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rochel</hi> againſt the King; and he being now
dead, and Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> in his Place, an <hi>Italian,</hi> who
ſeemed very kind to the Queen, but yet gave very little and ordinary
Supplies, that he might a little continue the Struggle; but he was more
ſollicitous to keep a good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Parliament, and to
profeſs a Neutrality betwixt the King and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by means of
<hi>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</hi> 
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0319800400:152"/> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Ambaſſador, who made all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Parliament. But that
which put a Period to all our King's Hopes, was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the Lord
<hi>Aſtley</hi> near <hi>Stow in the Wold,</hi> who was taken Priſoner with
ſeveral other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and were all either killed or diſperſed, as they
were coming from <hi>Worceſter</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> which hindred the
King from drawing any other Troops into the Field; and being now in the Ebb of
his good Fortunes, he thought it in vain to expect a Treaty with his
Parliament, who, in the Height of his good Succeſs, would liſten to no
Reaſon: Yet, to ſatisfy his Friends, who were generally inclined to Peace,
he ſent a Meſſage to his Parliament, full of tender Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
ſetting forth his deep Senſe of the Nation's Miſeries, by theſe civil
Diſtractions amongſt them, and conjured them, as they would anſwer it to
Almighty God, in that Day when he ſhould make Inquiſition for Blood, which
had, or might be ſpilt, in that unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral War; and as they tendred the
Preſervation of their Religion, by all the Bonds of Duty and Allegiance to
their King, of Compaſſion for their bleeding Country, or Charity to
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to diſpoſe their Hearts to a true Senſe, and to employ
their Faculties to a more ſerious Endeavour, together with his Majeſty, to
put a ſpeedy End to theſe waſting Diviſions, and to make both King and
People happy. But this Meſſage produced nothing, but much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
Propoſitions than thoſe at <hi>Uxbridge</hi>; and it was in vain for the
King to expoſtulate with <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0319800400:153"/> them who were reſolved not
to give him any reaſonable Satisfaction: And tho' the Houſe of Lords was
willing to correſpond with the King's Deſires, yet they were over-ruled and
curbed by the Commons, the Lords then ſtanding but as Cyphers, and were
forced by the Commons into a Compliance, in whatever they deſired or
determined; and if the Lords diſſented to any Particular, they would do it
without them, the active Commons doing all things at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Which
did ſufficiently demonſtrate, that they had no Intention to come to any
Agreement of Peace, but to purſue their Deſigns to the uttermoſt Round of
the Ladder; and having once drawn their Swords againſt their lawful Prince,
to throw away the Scabbard, knowing their Crimes could not be ſafe, but by
attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater: And tho' the Deſign was hatched in the Houſe of
Commons, for the Extirpation of Monarchy, yet I really believe the tenth Part
of them never knew, nor thought, that the Buſineſs would go ſo far, as at
laſt it did, they looking no farther than the bare Outſide of Things, which
carried a fair Shew and Gloſs, to fight for King and Parliament, and were
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly drawn in by the Inſinuation of the prevailing Party.</p>
            <p>The King found all his Endeavours for Peace ſignified nothing,
that the Commons were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon his Ruine, and that nothing would
ſerve but his Submiſſion to all they demanded, againſt which he was
abſolutely reſolved, it being his Obligation in Honour and Conſcience, 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0319800400:154"/> not to abandon a juſt Cauſe, nor injure his
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, nor forſake his Friends; and therefore expected no other
Succeſs, but to end his Days with Honour and a good Conſcience, and did
ſeriouſly avow, as appeared by his Letter to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi>
wherein he freely told the Prince, that thoſe who would ſtay with him, were
to expect and reſolve, either to die for a good Cauſe, or, which was
worſe, to live as miſerable in maintaining it, as the Inſolence of
inſulting Rebels could make them.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I knew not General <hi>Goring,</hi> till he
came to the King in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> after the Battle of
<hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> but I have heard great Reflections made upon his
Conduct in the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> of which he was
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Beginning of the War; and moſt wondered why the King would
employ him, being made General of all the Horſe in <hi>England,</hi> and
Generaliſſimo in the Weſt, both of Horſe and Foot. But I believe he had
done ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Service for our King in <hi>France,</hi> before he
came over with the Queen; and I have been informed from good Hands, that he did
not only procure great Store of Arms and Ammunition, but furniſhed the Queen
alſo with a conſiderable Sum of Money, which he got by his Dexterity and
Cunning; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo much with the King, that, by the Queen's
Interceſſion, he gave him thoſe great Commands, which made a mighty
Noiſe in the Army, and gave great Diſcontent to many. As to his Perſon, I
had as much Reaſon to know <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0319800400:155"/> him as any, and was always
entruſted with his moſt ſecret Diſpatches; and tho' I know his Memory
remains blaſted upon ſeveral Occaſions, yet I cannot but do him this
Right, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honeſty obliges me to ſay of him: That he was a
Perſon of extraordinary Abilities, as well as Courage, and was, without
Diſpute, as good an Officer as any ſerved the King, and the moſt
dexterous, in any ſudden Emergency, that I have ever ſeen, and could
extricate himſelf with the leaſt Concern, of which I was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Eye-Witneſs upon ſeveral Occaſions in the Siege of <hi>Taunton,</hi>
where Collonel <hi>Blague</hi> the then Governour made many ſharp and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Sallies; but he was ſtill repulſed and beaten back with Loſs,
by the Courage and Dexterity of General <hi>Goring,</hi> without which that
Siege had been ſoon raiſed. But after all that can be ſaid in General
<hi>Goring</hi>'s Behalf, he had likewiſe his blind Side, for he ſtrangely
loved the Bottle, was much given to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and a great Debauchee;
and the great Misfortune was, when he commanded in chief in the Weſt of
<hi>England,</hi> his Excellency had two Companions, who commanded next under
him, who fed his wild Humour and Debauch, and one of them, if not both, wanted
his great and natural Courage. Theſe two Commanders, the one being Lieutenant
General, made the General turn his Wantonneſs into Riot, and his Riot into
Madneſs: So that if the King had been truly informed of their continued
ſtrange Debauches, his Majeſty would either have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved 
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0319800400:156"/> them from him, or all Three from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Truſt or
Employment: For when Princes give way to the Vices of their Commanders, tho'
they be never ſo brave Men, they ſeldom recompenſe their Neglects by any
future Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; for they muſt ſtand in Awe of the Prince they ſerve,
or elſe the Prince muſt be Servant to their Humour.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Siege of <hi>Taunton</hi> continued, I confeſs
Lieutenant General <hi>Porter</hi> had ſeveral Conferences with the Officers
of the Rebels that were then in that Garriſon, to the great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of many,
who knew not what Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make of it; but this being often
practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among the Chiefs of the Army, much No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was not taken of it.
About this time Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Goring</hi> ſeemed ſomething diſcontented
with the Prince's Council; whereupon Sir <hi>John Berkeley,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh
Pollard,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi> were ſent to confer with
General <hi>Goring,</hi> to know particularly what he deſired. Their
Conference was kept very private; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I was informed, that the General
carried himſelf very extravagantly, and that they could not ſatisfy him.
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> being then coming into the Weſt againſt General
<hi>Goring,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> recommended to him the Garriſon
of <hi>Langport,</hi> as being of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the Security of
<hi>Bridgwater:</hi> But Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Goring</hi>'s Troops being quartered
about <hi>Langport,</hi> took away the Contribution aſſigned for the
Support of it, to ſupply his own Army, which brought the Garriſon ſo low,
that when <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0319800400:157"/> it might have been very advantageous to our
Army, it had very little or no Proviſion in it. And then, to add to our
Miſery, the Clubmen in <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> began
to riſe, and ſent Complaints to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> of the great
Oppreſſions and Diſorders committed by our Army, which the Prince
promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and went to General <hi>Goring</hi> about it, ſetting
forth the great Danger the Country was in, by the Liberty his Troops took to
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But the General having no Money to give the Army, connived at
the Licence they took, and, at the ſame time, to ſhew his Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
ſided in many things with the Clubmen, who in the End did us as much
Miſchief as the Power of the Rebels, who, about that time, being towards the
Month of <hi>July,</hi> entered <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and being
ſuppreſſed, and agreed with Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> he beſieged
and took <hi>Sherborn</hi> Caſtle, which was well defended by Sir <hi>Lewis
Dives,</hi> who was there taken Priſoner, with Collonel <hi>Strangeways</hi>
and ſeveral others. After the taking of <hi>Sherborn,</hi> the Parliament
Army advanced towards General <hi>Goring,</hi> who was encamped about
<hi>Langport,</hi> which, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the River on the one Side, and the
great Marſh or Bogg betwixt that and <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> was eſteemed a
ſtrong Poſt, and likewiſe to make a good Retreat, in Caſe we were
beaten. The Day before we engaged, the General ſent Lieutenant General
<hi>Porter,</hi> with three Brigades of Horſe, on the other Side the River,
farther from the Enemy than we were, and in a Race <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0319800400:158"/>
Campagne, who had his Quarters beaten up at Noon Day, by General
<hi>Maſſey,</hi> for want of Scouts being out, the Lieutenant General
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in his utmoſt Debauches with ſome of his Officers. The Enemy
was ſeen coming from the Hills a Mile before them, and yet was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Men,
before they could get to their Horſes, who were feeding in the Meadows. The
Alarm being brought to General <hi>Goring,</hi> he immediately marched in
Perſon to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, rallied the Horſe that were flying, ſtopp'd the
Enemy's Carreer, who were eagerly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and made a handſome Retreat,
without which the beſt Part of our Army had been loſt that Day; and when
our General met Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Porter</hi> in the Rear flying with the
reſt, his Excellency turned to me, and ſaid, <hi>He deſerves to be
piſtoll'd for his Negligence or Cowardice</hi>; but being the General's
Brother-in-Law, that Fault was ſoon forgotten and pardoned: And yet I have
often heard the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſay, <hi>That his Brother-in-Law, Lieutenant
General</hi> Porter, <hi>was the beſt Company, but the worſt Officer, that
ever ſerved the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Beating up of Lieutenant General <hi>Porter</hi>'s
Quarters, <hi>Fairfax,</hi> with his Army, marched directly to us from
<hi>Evil,</hi> where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plain and riſing Ground, the Enemy's Army was
drawn up upon it, with a great Marſh and Bogg between both Armies, which
hindred the Enemy from attacking us, except by one Paſſage in the Bottom of
the Hill, between both Armies, which Paſſage was narrow, and 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0319800400:159"/> our General had placed there two Regiments of Foot to
guard that Paſſage; which were Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Slaughter</hi>'s and Collonel
<hi>Wiſe</hi>'s Regiments, lately raiſed in South <hi>Wales.</hi> General
<hi>Goring</hi> himſelf, with all his Horſe, was drawn up upon the Hill, at
the Mouth of the Paſſage, with the Infantry upon his right Hand, near
<hi>Langport,</hi> to ſuccour thoſe two Regiments, in caſe of Attack upon
the Paſs, which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hoped to make good, at leaſt till Night, that
then we might retire with leſs Loſs, being unſeen. In the mean time,
General <hi>Goring</hi> commanded me to ſend away all the Baggage and Cannon,
except two Field Pieces, which he commanded ſhould be drawn to the Top of the
Hill, at the Head of the Paſs, and bid me to order Sir <hi>Joſeph
Wagſtaffe</hi> from him, who commanded the Foot near to <hi>Langport,</hi>
that in caſe the Enemy ſhould force the Paſs upon him, that then Sir
<hi>Joſeph Wagſtaffe</hi> ſhould retire with all his Foot to
<hi>Langport,</hi> and there paſs the River towards <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> and
burn down the Bridge behind him, which was a Draw-bridge over the River; and,
in the Morning, when I had Orders to ſend away the Baggage and Cannon, I
ſent them that Way, for their greater Security, otherwiſe they had been all
loſt; for we were in Hopes to keep that Paſs till Night: Yet ſo ſoon as
the Enemy had put their Army in Order of Battle, upon the Top of the Hill, on
the other Side the Bogg, which we thought was their whole Army, they opened and
drew to their Right and Left, advancing <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0319800400:160"/> towards the
Paſs, whilſt another great Body came up in their Place, by which their Army
was more than double our Number. However, our General neither loſt his
Courage nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but ſtill remained at the Head of the Paſs, with his
own Guards of Horſe, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Collonel <hi>Patrick Barnwell,</hi> a very
brave <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman, Son to the Lord <hi>Barnwell</hi>; next to
him was the General's own Regiment of Horſe, commanded by Collonel
<hi>Charles Goring,</hi> his Excellency's Brother, who was alſo ſeconded by
Sir <hi>Arthur Slingsby,</hi> with his Regiment of Horſe, and the reſt of
the Horſe Army behind him; but the Enemy advancing very faſt down the Hill,
with Horſe, Foot, Dragoons and Cannon, much overpowered us in Number; and our
Foot that were drawn down to guard the Paſs not doing their Duty, many of
them deſerting, and ſhooting againſt us, the Enemy thereupon gained the
Paſs. The General charged the Enemy twice, but being much overpowered in
Number, we were at laſt beaten off, and obliged to a very diſorderly
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The Foot, commanded by Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Wagſtaffe,</hi> retired
to <hi>Langport</hi>; as did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and
retreated over the Bridge that Way to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> having broken and
burnt down the Draw-bridge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them: But our Horſe were obliged to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the ordinary Way, which being a mooriſh Ground, full of ſeveral
narrow Paſſes, where ſeveral Officers were obliged to ſtay, to make
good the Retreat for others; ſo that divers of <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0319800400:161"/>
Diſtinction were taken, too many to be reckoned up, and among the Priſoners
was Sir <hi>Arthur Slingsby,</hi> but Lieutenant General <hi>Porter</hi>
eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that Way, Room being made for him by other Officers. But our
General, with his Brother, Mr. <hi>Barnwell,</hi> Sir <hi>Bernard
Gaſcoigne,</hi> and my ſelf, with ſome of our Retinue, were obliged to
leave the Army upon our Left, to get over ſeveral difficult Places. However,
we came at laſt ſafe to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> tho' ſomething about, and
were in great Fear, that all our Foot and Cannon were loſt; but it ſeems
Sir <hi>Joſeph Wagſtaffe</hi> marched all Night, and came ſafe the next
Morning to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> and we loſt only one Piece of Cannon that
Way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Carriage of it was broke. I ſtayed all that Night with
the General in his Chamber, and when I gave him Notice in the Morning, that Sir
<hi>Joſeph Wagſtaffe</hi> was come with the Foot and the Cannon, he was
overjoyed.</p>
            <p>After we had repoſed two Days at <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> and got
together our ſhattered Troops, who all paſt thro' <hi>Bridgwater</hi> as
faſt as they came, for their greater Security, we then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards
<hi>Dunſtar</hi> Caſtle, which we left on our Right, and made little or no
Stop till we came near <hi>Torrington,</hi> where our Army quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the
General made his Head Quarters at Mr. <hi>Rolles</hi>'s Houſe, where we
ſtayed ſome Days, and then we marched towards <hi>Barnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and
from thence to <hi>Exeter,</hi> where we ſtayed that Winter, with Four
Thouſand Horſe, who quartered in the Country near us. Whilſt 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0319800400:162"/> we were about <hi>Torrington,</hi> the General ſent
the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> at
<hi>Launceſton,</hi> making great Complaints of his hard Uſage, and made
ſeveral Demands from the General, to which no Anſwer was given, becauſe
the Chancellor of the Exchequer was abſent, being gone farther into
<hi>Cornwal</hi> upon great Affairs of the Prince; and beſides, the Prince
intended, at the Chancellor's Return, to go to <hi>Exeter</hi>; and when the
Prince came thither, General <hi>Goring</hi> was ill, and in a Courſe of
Phyſick: Whereupon the Chancellor was ſent to him, to whom, after many
Aſſurances of continuing faithful to the King, and his Intereſt, he then
freely declared his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Brother <hi>Porter</hi>'s
Negligence, or Treachery, in many particular Inſtances, and that he
reſolved to be quit of him. The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor then told his Excellency freely,
that his Demands by the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> to the Prince, were not
ſeaſonable for his Royal Highneſs to grant, nor fit for him to aſk; and
ſo the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor left General <hi>Goring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget to tell, that whilſt General
<hi>Goring,</hi> Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Porter,</hi>
and moſt of the General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, both Horſe and Foot, kept their Winter
Quarters in and about <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Death of Sir <hi>John Digby</hi>
made vacant the Employment of a Major General of Horſe to the Lord
<hi>Goring</hi>'s Army, for which there were ſeveral Pretendants, amongſt
which was Collonel <hi>Samuel Tuke,</hi> who being the eldeſt Collonel of 
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0319800400:163"/> Horſe in our Army, ſtood faireſt for it,
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being a Favourite to Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Porter,</hi> and to
Collonel <hi>Charles Goring,</hi> the General's Brother; and therefore made his
firſt Addreſs to the Lieutenant General, deſiring his Aſſiſtance in
his Pretentions; which being promiſed him by the Lieutenant General, he then
applied himſelf to the Lord General <hi>Goring,</hi> who told him, he would
willingly have ſerved him, but that he was before engaged for Collonel
<hi>Webb,</hi> by the Interceſſion of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Porter:</hi>
At which Collonel <hi>Tuke</hi> being much ſurprized, he preſently demanded
the Lord General's Permiſſion to quit his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, declaring, that being
the eldeſt Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in the Army, he thought it a Right belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to him,
and that he could not ſerve with Honour, ſince another was put over his
Head. Hereupon the Lord General forthwith promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him his Diſcharge, and
commanded his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, <hi>Dun,</hi> to draw it. Upon this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from
the General himſelf, that he was ingaged for Collonel <hi>Webb,</hi> upon the
Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lieutenant General <hi>Porter,</hi> Collonel <hi>Tuke</hi>
wrote a very reproachful Letter to the Lieutenant General, which ſo ſoon as
he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he forthwith ſent his Brother-in-Law, Collonel <hi>Charles
Goring</hi> (for they were then both at Sir <hi>William Portman</hi>'s, five
Miles from <hi>Exeter</hi>) to deſire Collonel <hi>Tuke</hi> to meet him at a
Place he then appointed, to interpret his Letter; and Collonel <hi>Goring</hi>
alſo told Collonel <hi>Tuke,</hi> that he muſt bring a Friend with him, 
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0319800400:164"/> who thereupon ſent to Collonel <hi>Adrian Scroop,</hi>
who promiſed to go with him the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But this Buſineſs was not
carried ſo privately, but that it quickly came to the Lord General's
Knowledge, who preſently ſent for me, and commanded me to ſet Guards
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon Collonel <hi>Tuke,</hi> and upon Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Scroop,</hi>
and to require them, in his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's Name, not to ſtir from their
Lodgings till farther Orders. The Lord General was at this time indiſpoſed
with the Gout, and kept his Bed, but he preſently ſent for the Lord
<hi>Wentworth,</hi> and deſired him to call a Council of War the next
Morning, of the principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that were then Town, and that his
Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would be Preſident of it, for that there was a Quarrel, and a
Duel deſigned, betwixt Lieutenant General <hi>Porter</hi> and Collonel
<hi>Tuke:</hi> That this laſt was already ſecured in his Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and
alſo Collonel <hi>Scroop,</hi> who was to be his Second; and that he had
ſent for the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, and his Brother Collonel <hi>Goring,</hi>
who was concerned in the Quarrel. The next Morning the Council of War met,
where Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Porter</hi> was preſent, and ſat with the
Council, which was compoſed of the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> as Preſident,
Lieutenant General <hi>Porter,</hi> Major General <hi>Wagſtaffe,</hi> Sir
<hi>William Courtney,</hi> Sir <hi>Foulk</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Hunkes,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Baſſet,</hi> and my ſelf. The firſt thing (after having
read the Letter) upon Debate was, That the Letter was very reproachful and
provoking: The Subſtance of the Letter was, <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0319800400:165"/> 
               <hi>That
he</hi> (Collonel <hi>Tuke</hi>) <hi>would no more accuſe Lieutenant
General</hi> Porter <hi>of Cowardice, ſince he had fought, and killed a
Collonel in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Honour; but that the Lieutenant General was
guilty of many other Sins, which ran in the ſame Rank with Cowardice; as, in
his Breach of Faith, having promiſed to aſſiſt him in his Pretentions
to the General, when he had before ingaged the General to another: In his
little or no Religion, in turning the Bible and all ſacred things into
Ridicule: In his great and conſtant Debaucheries, with many other Vices not
fit to be named; and that now being upon even Terms with him, he could do no
leſs than reproach him for his treacherous and unjuſt Dealing, in this
Particular of his Pretentions, from the General's own Mouth; and that he
ſhould look upon him as his darling Sin, whom he had loved the longeſt, and
had the moſt Reaſon to repent him of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After reading this Letter, which was much enlarged upon by the
Lieutenant General, who declared, that tho' the Letter was not a formal
Challenge, yet it was ſo provoking and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that no Man of Honour
could receive it, without giving a Challenge to him that ſent it; and that
this was alſo from an inferior Officer to a ſuperior, which was Death by
the Articles of War. Hereupon aroſe a long Debate, after which the Council
ordered, that I ſhould go forthwith to the Lord General, to know from him,
whether he had diſcharged Collonel <hi>Tuke</hi> from being an Officer in his
Army? To which <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0319800400:166"/> the General told me, <hi>That he had
diſcharged him, and promiſed him a formal Diſcharge in Writing, and
commanded his Secretary to draw it up; and that if it was not done, it was the
Fault of his Secretary; and that ſince he had diſcharged him by Word of
Mouth, he eſteemed him to be no longer an Officer.</hi> Upon my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
this Anſwer from the General, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil left off that Point, of debating
his being an Officer; but the Council thought fit a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhould be drawn
up, and preſented to him, which he ſhould read publickly in Council, which
was done accordingly in theſe Words following. <hi>I confeſs to have
written a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and injurious Letter to Lieutenant General</hi> Porter,
<hi>for which I am heartily ſorry, and ſo deſire his Remiſſion and
Friendſhip.</hi> This Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting being agreed upon by the Council, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Tuke</hi> was called in to make this publick Acknowledgment; which Paper
being given to Collonel <hi>Tuke,</hi> he having firſt read the Words
privately to himſelf, he expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in publick thus. <hi>I
confeſs to have written a Letter to Lieutenant General</hi> Porter; <hi>it
was my Senſe of him when I wrote it, which is ſtill my Belief, and there is
not a Syllable in it which I will not juſtify with my Life.</hi> Upon this
the Council commanded him to withdraw, and they began to be very ſharp upon
him, that he ſhould make that publick Declaration, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Sentiment
of the Council; and it was the Opinion of ſome, that he ſhould be
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon, till he ſhould make that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0319800400:167"/> Acknowledgment which the Council had ordered: But Sir
<hi>Foulk</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Hunkes,</hi> with Sir <hi>Thomas
Baſſet,</hi> declared againſt it, and ſaid, tho' he had ſpoken ſo
publickly his Senſe as to his own Letter, yet he had not refuſed <hi>in
terminis</hi> to make the Acknowledgment; and that therefore, before they came
to that Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, of committing him to Priſon, one of the Council ſhould
be ſent to him, to perſwade him to make that publick Acknowledgment; and
accordingly I was deſired to go to him, which I did, and told him the Senſe
of the Council, and that it was their general Opinion, that he ſhould not
ſcruple of making that publick Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgment, if he was called in again.
And upon my Return to the Council, and declaring that I found him willing to
make that Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, he was called in again; and after his Reſpects
made to the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> and the Council, he took the Paper in his
Hand, and ſaid, <hi>In Obedience to the Order of your Lordſhip and this
Council, I do confeſs to have written a ſcandalous and injurious Letter to
Lieutenant General</hi> Porter, <hi>for which I am heartily ſorry, and do
deſire his Remiſſion and Friendſhip</hi>; and then he retired. But then
the Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral began to complain heavily, and ſaid That was not a
ſufficient Satisfaction for the publick Scandal he had received, nor for the
inſolent Behaviour of Collonel <hi>Tuke,</hi> and he ſeemed nothing
pleaſed or ſatisfied with what the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had done, who thereupon broke
up without farther Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0319800400:168"/>Some time after this, Lieutenant General
<hi>Porter</hi> came again to <hi>Exeter,</hi> before it was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered,
and ſent again to Collonel <hi>Tuke</hi> for farther Satisfaction; but the
Collonel being then ſick in Bed, was not able to meet him as he deſired:
However, Collonel <hi>Tuke</hi> did then write a Letter to him, aſſuring
him, that ſo ſoon as he was able to get on Horſeback, he would not fail
to find him out, and give him the Satisfaction he deſired, if the Fear of our
ſudden Ruine did not make him go to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſooner, which fell out
as he foretold: For ſoon after this, Lieutenant General <hi>Porter</hi> made
his Peace with General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and went into the Parliament's
Quarters, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Tuke</hi> never heard more of him, nor from
him.</p>
            <p>About this time the King ſent to General <hi>Goring,</hi> to
march to him with his Army; but the General neither obeyed the King's Orders,
nor communicated them to the Prince, or advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Prince about them,
tho' his Royal Highneſs then let him know, that he was well content he
ſhould break thro' to the King with his Horſe, thinking he might well and
eaſily have done it: But the General (after Recovery of his Health) ſpent
his Time in his uſual Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and was privately reſolved to leave the
Army, and go beyond Sea; and Lieutenant General <hi>Porter</hi> was alſo
reſolved to quit the Army, and retire to <hi>London</hi>; but both theſe
Tranſactions were carried very privately, and known to none but the Lord
<hi>Wentworth,</hi> who <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0319800400:169"/> went to the Prince with a Letter
from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Goring,</hi> to beg Leave for his going into <hi>France,</hi>
for Recovery of his Health, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; yet intimating at the ſame time
to his Royal Highneſs, that he hoped to do him great Service by his going
thither. But I was after aſſured by the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> that he
never attended the Prince's Reſolution, but went forthwith to
<hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and there embarqued for <hi>France</hi>; but before his
going, ſign'd a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for ſome Money for Lieutenant General
<hi>Porter,</hi> to bear his Charges to <hi>London,</hi> who ſoon after the
Lord <hi>Goring</hi>'s Abſence, declined the Exerciſe of his Command, and
having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Paſs from Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> he went forthwith
to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the Lord <hi>Goring</hi>'s going for <hi>France,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> declared, that General <hi>Goring</hi> intended to
return no more, but relied upon his Lordſhip to preſerve the Horſe, till
he could procure Licence from the Parliament to tranſport them for the
Service of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or ſome other foreign Prince. But
after General <hi>Goring</hi> left the Army, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers took a greater
Liberty than before, and much reſented his going away. From the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of
<hi>July</hi> till towards the End of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the General ſtayed
at <hi>Exeter</hi>; and Four Thouſand Horſe were quartered in that
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, without making any Attempt upon the Enemy: And conſidering
his doing nothing in all that time but pleaſing himſelf, many were of
Opinion, that if he had been confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0319800400:170"/> with the
Enemy, and been corrupted to betray the Weſt, he could not have done worſe;
not having obeyed the King's Commands in going to him, tho' his Royal
Highneſs was willing to it. His Courage indeed was always eſteemed, but
leaſt of all his Conſcience and Integrity, and there was much Difference
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Preſentneſs of his Mind in a ſudden Attempt, (tho' never
ſo full of Danger) and of an Enterprize which required Deliberation and
Patience, for he could not keep his Mind long bent; of which I had a particular
Experience at his Siege of <hi>Taunton,</hi> where the Governour for the
Parliament made many frequent and dangerous Sallies, but were always
unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by the Vivacity and Courage of General <hi>Goring</hi>'s
Spirit, which was very extraordinary.</p>
            <p>After this General's going into <hi>France,</hi> his Army was
ſolely left to the Diſpoſition of the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who was a
very lazy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active Man, and was not thought either of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
Experience, Courage, or Reputation enough, for that Truſt which was devolved
upon him by General <hi>Goring:</hi> It was therefore reſolved by his Royal
Highneſs, that he ſhould rather be adviſed than commanded; and that if
his Lordſhip comported himſelf with that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Modeſty which was
expected from him, all Reſolutions ſhould be formed in the Prince's
Council, and all Orders ſhould iſſue in his Lordſhip's Name, for the
Relief of <hi>Exeter</hi>; for all the Army of Horſe was then drawn off from
<hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> 
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0319800400:171"/> was
quartered at <hi>Aſhburton,</hi> ſix Miles from <hi>Totnes,</hi> and the
whole Contribution which was for Support of the Army, was taken forcibly by the
Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Horſe. Whereupon the Prince, being then at
<hi>Totnes,</hi> ſent for the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who told the Prince in
the firſt Place, that he was to declare to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs, that he
could receive no Orders from any Perſon but his Highneſs, the Lord
<hi>Goring</hi> having repoſed that Truſt in him, and talked very
imperiouſly and diſreſpectfully. However, the Prince took little Notice
of it; but the next Day his Lordſhip being in Drink, which was his uſual
Fault, he talked very offenſively to the Chancellor (whom he always hated)
tho' of the Prince's Council, in Preſence of the Prince, who being much
diſſatisfied with the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Carriage, told him, he
would take the Command of the Army upon himſelf, and iſſue out the Orders
as he ſhould think fit; upon which the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> troubled, and
much unſatisfied, returned to his Quarters at <hi>Aſhburton,</hi> which
were ſoon after beaten up by the Enemy at Noon Day, and the Army thereby put
into great Diſorder.</p>
            <p>Upon this Incident the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> went in great
Haſte to the Prince, who was then at <hi>Taveſtock,</hi> upon the Borders
of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Particulars of his Loſs, which was not
ſo great as his Lordſhip imagined. The Prince was very deſirous to
purſue his former Reſolution of going to <hi>Totnes</hi> with the Body of
his Army; but the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> told him, he believed 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0319800400:172"/> the Enemy was poſſeſſed of <hi>Totnes,</hi> and
that he could not ſo ſoon recover his Loſs, nor get his Troops together
in any conſiderable Number, till they had ſome Days Reſt; and ſo that
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Prince was ended; whereas the Rout of the Army was
occaſioned only by ſmall Parties of the Enemy, who came into our Quarters
in the Daytime, and found no Guards, and all their Horſes in the Stables.
Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Royal Highneſs thought fit to go to <hi>Launceſton,</hi> upon
the Borders of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> to be farther from the Enemy, and commanded
the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> that all his Horſe ſhould be quartered on
<hi>Devonſhire</hi> Side, fearing otherwiſe, that all the Trained Bands of
<hi>Cornwal</hi> would run Home to ſave their Houſes from being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
to which the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Troops were much addicted, who
diſperſed themſelves for many Miles about the Country, as if no Enemy was
near them, and were all comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who challenged
them by Deputation from the Lord General <hi>Goring</hi>; and the Lord
<hi>Wentworth</hi> would ſubmit to no other Command but that of the Prince.
The Miſchief which grew hereupon was much more viſible than the Remedy,
when both Officers and Soldiers (by the Looſeneſs and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of the
Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Government) were glad to take any Occaſion of
Excuſe for laying down their Arms: And whoever was fit would hardly undertake
the Command of a diſſolute, undiſciplined, wicked, beaten Army, upon
which he muſt engage his Honour. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0319800400:173"/> ſome
Reſolution was abſolutely neceſſary in that Conjuncture to be taken by
the Prince, who thereupon declared the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> ſhould take upon
him the Care of the whole Army, as being General, and the Lord
<hi>Wentworth</hi> ſhould be General of the Horſe, and Collonel
<hi>Webb</hi> Major General, and Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil</hi> General of the
Foot.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> being entirely devoted to the King's
Intereſt, ſubmitted to the Pleaſure of the Prince, and told his Royal
Highneſs he would obey him, tho' he knew he muſt loſe his Honour: But
ſince his Royal Highneſs thought it neceſſary to command him, he was
moſt ready and willing to obey. There was no Suſpicion of Sir <hi>Richard
Greenvil,</hi> becauſe he had been before under the Command of the Lord
<hi>Hopton</hi>; but it was believed the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> (who had
carried himſelf more high and imperiouſly ſince his diſorderly Retreat
from <hi>Aſhburton,</hi> than before) would have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; in which Caſe
the Prince reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and would have
given his Command to the Lord <hi>Capel:</hi> But much contrary to Expectation,
Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil</hi> refuſed, who was thereupon forthwith ſent
Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the <hi>Mount</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where he was, till the
Enemy poſſeſſed the greateſt Part of that County; and then, that he
might not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of the Enemy, the Prince permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his being
tranſported beyond Sea. And tho' the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> ſeemed much
ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the Prince's Order, which he heard 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0319800400:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> read at the Council Table, deſired time to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it till the next Day, that he might confer with his Officers;
yet the Prince told him ſharply, that he would not refer his Acts to be
ſcanned by his Officers, but that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould preſently give
his poſitive Anſwer, whether he would ſubmit, or not? To which he
ſubmitted, and went that Night to his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; at which neither the Prince,
nor his Council, nor others, were very glad, but rather wiſhed he would have
obliged the Prince to make other Alterations, as the Prince intended, becauſe
he knew the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that he would never chearfully
obey.</p>
            <p>The Prince then hearing of the Loſs of <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and
every Day was News, and fearing the Loſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> it was thought
fit the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> ſhould march back with his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Torrington,</hi> and that the Prince ſhould not hazard his Perſon any
longer in that open Country, but ſhould retire to <hi>Truro,</hi> near the
nether End of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> for his greater Security.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fairfax</hi> having taken <hi>Dartmouth</hi> by Storm, the
Governour ſoon ſurrendered the Caſtle. He then came to <hi>Exeter,</hi>
which he ſummoned, but having received a ſtout Anſwer from Sir <hi>John
Berkeley</hi> the Governour, he left Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> to finiſh
that Work, and went with his Army after the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> who had fixed
himſelf near <hi>Torrington,</hi> and had not been there above four or five
Days, where he had made ſome Barricadoes and little Faſtneſſes, but he
heard that General <hi>Fairfax</hi> was come within <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0319800400:175"/>
eight Miles of him. However, the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> for good Reaſons,
thought it better to expect the Enemy there, than to retire into
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> with the few that remained of the Trained Bands, who would
immediately diſſolve, and run to their Houſes, and all would ſoon be
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed without Fighting; and therefore his Lordſhip choſe rather
ſtaying where he was, notwithſtanding the great Diſadvantage in Number,
thinking he might there defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with greater Advantage, than in any
other Place. Very ſharp Diſputes were on both Sides, and the Lord
<hi>Hopton</hi>'s Foot behaved themſelves with ſuch Courage, that they
maintained the Fight all that Day till Night, retiring ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Torrington</hi>; but at laſt, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by the Numbers of the
Enemy, who were ſupplied from time to time with freſh Troops, they forced
the Barricades, the Horſe with his Lordſhip neither charging nor making a
Stand, but baſely ran away in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, leaving their General, the
Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> who was hurt in the Face with a Pike, and his Horſe
killed under him; but receiving a freſh Horſe, he was obliged to retire to
<hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where he ſtayed ſome Days, till Twelve Hundred of his
Foot came up to him. Upon his Lordſhip's retiring, the Enemy entered
<hi>Torrington,</hi> and fell to Pillaging and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the whole Town
extreamly, but were ſoon ſtopt, by the Ammunition in the Church taking
Fire, by what Accident was unknown, but it brought a diſmal Deſtruction
both upon <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0319800400:176"/> the Soldiers and Burghers, there being near an
Hundred Barrels of Powder in the Church, which made a terrible <hi>Fracas</hi>
amongſt all People; which being finiſhed, and General <hi>Fairfax</hi>
having a little ſettled <hi>Torrington,</hi> he marched after the Lord
<hi>Hopton</hi> to <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> whereupon his Lordſhip retired farther
to <hi>Bodmin,</hi> and thoſe Horſe commanded by the Lord
<hi>Wentworth</hi> obſerved no Orders. The Prince went from <hi>Truro</hi> to
<hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle, and the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Capel</hi> advertized his Royal Highneſs, that they had ſeverally
received Intelligence of a Deſign to ſeize upon the Perſon of the Prince,
who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returned no more to <hi>Truro,</hi> but ſtayed at
<hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle, and no Perſon knew the King's Pleaſure
concerning the Prince, but the Lord <hi>Culpepper</hi> and the Chancellor of
the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; and they two knowing only what was to be done, had no great
Confidence that they ſhould have Reputation enough to go thro' with it,
finding the Earl of <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> who was then Governour to the Prince,
jealous of the Deſign of going into <hi>France,</hi> whatever they ſaid to
the contrary, and the Governour of <hi>Pendennis</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle being old and
fearful, they durſt not truſt him with the Secret: Whereupon they ſent
Letters forthwith to the Lords <hi>Hopton</hi> and <hi>Capel,</hi> to know
their Opinion, who both agreed, that the Prince was immediately, without Loſs
of Time, to be tranſported to <hi>Scilly,</hi> which was a Part of
<hi>Cornwal</hi>; and News being daily brought, that our Army was ſtill
retiring, and <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0319800400:177"/> General <hi>Fairfax</hi> advancing after
it, Reſolution was therefore taken, that the Prince ſhould that Night
embark for <hi>Scilly,</hi> a Ship being ready for him then in the Harbour; and
the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his Son (who was a worthy honeſt Gentleman) were called in
to the Prince's Chamber, and made acquainted with it; and that Night the Prince
went on Board, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the next Night ſafe in <hi>Scilly</hi>; from
whence the Lord <hi>Culpepper</hi> was immediately diſpatched to
<hi>France,</hi> to acquaint the Queen with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Prince in that
Iſland, and with the Wants and Incommodities of it, and that it was not ſo
ſtrong as reported; and therefore his Royal Highneſs was ſoon embarked
from thence for <hi>France,</hi> where they all ſafely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
            <p>When the Prince was gone, and the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> left
General in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> he ſoon found the Soldiers, eſpecially the
Horſe, could not be reſtrained from Plundering, and thereupon his
Excellency called a Council of War, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what was to be done. The
Lord <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> with the principal Officers, declared, that the Men
would never be brought to fight, being taken in a worſe Trap, than they took
<hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army near <hi>Foy,</hi> and the Horſe Officers
propoſed to ſend for a Treaty, to which they all agreed, except Major
General <hi>Webb.</hi> The Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> told them, he could not
conſent to a Treaty, without Leave from the Prince. But whilſt the Officers
continued their Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, a Trumpeter arrived at the ſame time 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0319800400:178"/> from General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> with a Letter to the Lord
<hi>Hopton,</hi> offering a Treaty, which his Lordſhip kept private: However,
the General Officers all aſſembled, and declared, if the Lord
<hi>Hopton</hi> would not conſent to a Treaty, they would treat themſelves;
and that in the <hi>Interim</hi> they would neither keep Guards, nor do their
Duty, the Enemy's Horſe every Day mingling with them, without any Act of
Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and bought ſeveral of our Soldiers Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Then the Lord
<hi>Hopton</hi> declared, that he would neither treat for himſelf, nor for
any of the Garriſons, and gave the Horſe Leave to treat. Whereupon ſome
Perſons were preſently appointed, and Articles were ſoon concluded, and
the Army of Horſe was diſſolved; and every Horſeman who had not ſold
his Horſe, had Twenty Shillings, with a Paſſport from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Fairfax,</hi> to go home to their Houſes, and there to live quietly,
without engaging farther in the Wars; and many of our Soldiers had ſold and
exchanged ſo many good Horſes, for pitiful Jades they received from the
Enemy, that they would not give Twenty Shillings apiece for them; and ſo many
Hundred of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers went Home on Horſeback, with their Paſſes from the
General, that the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> was obliged to treat with the Enemy,
tho' he would have no Article for himſelf, nor be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Treaty:
After which, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> Lord
<hi>Capel,</hi> and Major General <hi>Webb,</hi> went to the <hi>Mount</hi> in
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> from whence they were tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0319800400:179"/>
to <hi>Scilly,</hi> and from thence were embarqued for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being now reduced to the loweſt Condition that
poſſibly could be, having loſt all his Forces, moſt of his Garriſons
taken and yielded, and General <hi>Fairfax</hi> having cleared the Weſt, was
marching to beſiege <hi>Oxford.</hi> The King being there, began to think of
ſome Way for his Eſcape and Safety; and being treacherouſly invited by
the <hi>Scots,</hi> to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the Protection of their Army then
at the Siege of <hi>Newark,</hi> his Majeſty went diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed from
<hi>Oxford,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1646, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied only with Mr. <hi>John
Aſhburnham,</hi> a Groom of his Bed-chamber, and Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> a
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, few or none elſe being acquainted with his Deſign; but all
were amazed, when they heard he was arrived in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Camp, he
having been before-hand promiſed Security for himſelf, and thoſe he
brought with him, or that ſhould come to him, tho' they denied both in Word
and Act, as plainly appeared by their delivering him to the Parliament, a
Priſoner, for Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>Sterling:</hi> And that the
<hi>Scots</hi> may be the better known, I ſhall give you their Character by
one who was well acquainted with their wicked Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. He tells us,
<hi>They are a People who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to enſlave others, yet are of a
ſlaviſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition themſelves; a People, whoſe Freedom is Service,
whoſe Mercies are Cruelties, whoſe Religion is only Formality, whoſe
Government is Tyranny, a Generation of Vipers and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> 
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0319800400:180"/> 
               <hi>whom no Oaths or Covenants can bind, no Courteſy
or Civility oblige.</hi> Thus the King was delivered Priſoner to the
Parliament by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and by the Parliament ſent Priſoner to
<hi>Holmby</hi>; and from thence he was ſoon after forcibly taken away, and
carried to the Army, by Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi>; who being aſked by the
Parliament Commiſſioners, who then waited upon the King, by what Authority
he did it? He anſwered, it was by the Pleaſure of the Army, and that the
King ſhould be with them with Honour, and in Safety. This Action ſtartled
the Parliament extreamly, who from this time began to ſurrender themſelves
and their Power into the Hands of their own Army. The General, in his Letter to
the Parliament, makes the King's Remove from <hi>Holmby</hi> to be by his own
Conſent; tho' certainly it was not ſo, tho' it might be without the
General's Knowledge: And the Lord <hi>Dumfermling</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the
Parliament, that the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to tell them, that his Majeſty was
unwillingly taken away, by a Party from the Army; and that he deſired both
Houſes to maintain the Laws of the Land, and that he might be obliged to
ſign many things in that Condition, and that he would not have them be
believed, till they had farther Notice from his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the Inconſtancy of Men, and the Uncertainty of
worldly Affairs. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers of an Army, tho' never ſo
ſucceſsful and well diſciplined, will, for want <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0319800400:181"/> of
Action, fall into Diſcord, and Deſigns of Trouble: A victorious Army out of
Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is very inclinable to aſſume Power over their Leaders. When
the Parliament had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and Succeſs after their own Deſires, yet
they were ſtrangely encumbered with the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinery of their Army on the one
Side, and with diſcontented Petitions on the other, beſides the Petulancy
of many Pamphlets, which daily flew abroad againſt their Proceedings. Many
believed there was ſome private Treaty at this time by ſome Officers of the
Army with the King, and that Inſtructions were given for it by
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> that if the King would aſſent to their Propoſals,
which were much lower than thoſe of the Parliament, the Army would then
ſettle the King upon his Throne. The King, in his own Judgment, ſeemed
inclined to it, and therefore diſdained the Parliament's Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and
would rely upon the Propoſals of the Army, and urged a Treaty upon them. The
<hi>Scots</hi> complain of the King's being taken from <hi>Holmby</hi> by
Force, and would not apply to the Army, ſince it ought to be under the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Parliament: They declared, that their Stability and Happineſs
did much depend upon the Safety and Preſervation of the King's Perſon, and
that they would endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the unhappy Differences; and therefore
deſire the Propoſitions may be proceeded upon by the mutual Conſent of
both Kingdoms, and deſire there might be a preſent Treaty with the King,
and that he might come to <hi>London</hi> with <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0319800400:182"/> Safety,
Honour, and Freedom. The King being then paſſionately ſenſible of the
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and unſettled State of the Kingdom, and of their great
Diſtractions, preſſed earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Peace, and was moſt willing to
teſtify to all the World his Readineſs to contribute his utmoſt
Endeavours for it: But the Parliament then thought the King was too much in the
Army's Intereſt, who were then contriving their main Deſign, of coming up
to <hi>London,</hi> to curb both Parliament and City, and to make them act
according to their Preſcriptions.</p>
            <p>About this time the Agitators were ſet up, who were ſome
Soldiers elected out of each Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Horſe and Foot, to meet and
conſult by that Name, who undertook to underſtand and regulate the chief
Affairs of the Army. Theſe Men were very buſy, and the King was privately
informed, whether by Deſign of the Army, was not known, but ſuppoſed by
moſt to be ſo, that the Agitators intended ſome Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the King's
ſacred Perſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King was privately perſwaded to make an
Eſcape, if poſſible, and contrived by Sir <hi>John Berkeley,</hi>
Collonel <hi>Leg,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Aſhburnham,</hi> who provided a Ship
at <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Horſes were to be ready at <hi>Hampton</hi>
Ferry, on the other Side, for the King's Eſcape: And that which gave moſt
Suſpicion that the Army deſigned the King's Eſcape, was, that Collonel
<hi>Whaley</hi> (who had the Guard of the King's Perſon) did that very Day
give the King a Letter, which he ſaid was put into his Hand 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0319800400:183"/> by an unknown Perſon, giving a blind Account of the
Agitators Intention to take away the King's Life for the Good of the Nation;
and that very Night <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſent a Letter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Parliament
that the King was eſcaped, the Manner thus.</p>
            <p>The Officers who attended the King, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he came not forth
of his Chamber to Supper, having been long in, writing, they went into his
Chamber, and miſſed him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an Hour after he was gone; and his
Cloak was careleſsly caſt upon the Ground, in his Way to the Water-ſide;
and this following Letter was left upon the Table, written with his own Hand,
to be communicated to the Parliament, in theſe Words following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Liberty the King now generally preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, and aimed
at, was as neceſſary for Kings as any other: That he had a long Time
endured Captivity, hoping it might tend to the Settlement of a good Peace; but
finding the contrary, and the Unfixedneſs of the Army, and new Guards ſet
upon him, he had withdrawn himſelf: That wherever he ſhould be, he would
earneſtly labour for ſettling a good Peace, and to prevent the Effuſion
of more Blood; and if he might be heard with Freedom Honour, and Safety, he
would inſtantly break through his Cloud of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and ſhew himſelf
ready to be</hi> Pater Patriae. Upon reading this Letter, and
<hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Information, it was ordered in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That it
ſhould be Loſs of Life and Eſtate for any one to conceal or detain the 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0319800400:184"/> King's Perſon, and not to diſcover it to both
Houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Upon the King's Eſcape the Parliament ſent all Ways to find
him; but in the dark, rainy, cloudy Night the King was loſt in
<hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt, and paſſing in the Morning thro'
<hi>Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to the Sea-ſide, his Majeſty miſſed his Deſign of
going to <hi>Jerſey,</hi> the Ship failing to be at the Place, if any Place
was really ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed which was promiſed; and the Want of it cauſed ſome
Reflections upon the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who was very well known to me. The King
fearing a Diſcovery of him could by no Means be prevented, it was reſolved,
that the Kjng and Collonel <hi>Leg</hi> ſhould lodge that Night at
<hi>Tedſworth,</hi> at the Houſe of the Counteſs Dowager of
<hi>Southampton,</hi> which was near the Sea; and that the other two ſhould
ferry over to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to find Collonel <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
under whole Aſſurance, for his Brother's ſake, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the
King hoped for ſome Friendſhip and Fidelity. This Deſign was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
put in Execution; and Sir <hi>John Berkeley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſhburnham</hi>
were both told by the King, that unleſs Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> gave his
Oath and Faith of Preſervation, Protection, Secrecy, and Freedom to the
King's Perſon at all Times, they ſhould not diſcover any more, than
ſignify in general the King's Eſcape from the imminent Danger of
Aſſaſſination: That the King's Deſire led him to caſt himſelf
upon Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> for Protection, which if he ſhould refuſe,
and ſecure the Perſons of Sir <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0319800400:185"/> 
               <hi>John Berkeley</hi>
and <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi> the King and <hi>Leg</hi> (by their not returning at
the Time prefixed) might have Opportunity to diſpoſe of themſelves
otherwiſe. Theſe two being diſpatch'd, the King ſent <hi>Leg</hi> to
the Counteſs, to tell her, that a Perſon of Quality, her dear Friend,
deſired the Privacy of her Houſe that Night, without Diſcovery; to which
ſhe readily conſented. On <hi>Sunday</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the two Meſſengers
got into the Iſland, and met Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> on his Way towards
<hi>Newport,</hi> whom they acquainted with the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The Collonel
told them, he wiſhed the King's Safety as his own Soul, that he ſhould not
be inquiſitive where the King was, but were he in his Cuſtody, his Oath and
Intereſt to the Parliament being in Ballance, he ſhould be ſafe from
Violence; but for the Freedom and Liberty of his Perſon, he could not
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to his Superiours. This Anſwer tho' not ſatisfactory, nor
according to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; yet they, being loath to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Cuſtody, or for what other Reaſon none can tell, came over with the
Collonel and a Guard to the Houſe of the Counteſs; and
<hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi> went up Stairs to the King's Chamber, and told the King
Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at Supper, and had given Aſſurance of
Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for his Majeſty's Safety, but not of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for his Perſon; which
the King hearing, in Paſſion ſtruck his Hand upon his Breaſt, and
replied to <hi>Aſhburnham; And is this all? Then I am betrayed!
Aſhburnham</hi> and <hi>Berkeley,</hi> ſorry for their great
Miſadviſedneſs, would have made <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0319800400:186"/> ſome deſperate
Attempt to have killed <hi>Hammond,</hi> which the King would not admit of; and
in this Extremity, with a ſeeming Willingneſs, the King went over with them
and with Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> to <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Caſtle. Collonel
<hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> immediately acquaints the Parliament with the King's being
there, who forthwith vote the King ſhould ſtay there; that none who had
bore Arms againſt the Parliament ſhould ſtay in the Iſland, excepting
ſuch Inhabitants as had compounded; that no Delinquent or Foreigner ſhould
be admitted to the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence without Leave of Parliament; that thoſe
Perſons who attended the King thither ſhould be ſent to the Parliament,
which Collonel <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> refuſed; and alſo complained, that the
Conditions for the King were not ſuitable to his Quality. Thus that unhappy
King fell out of one Trap into another; and ſends his Meſſage to the
Parliament, why he did not receive their Propoſitions for Peace, which they
ſent him to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> becauſe the Commiſſioners from
<hi>Scotland</hi> preſented him the ſame Day with a Declaration againſt
thoſe Propoſitions, in the Name of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may take notice of the perplexed Condition of the
Parliament; the Army raiſed, commiſſioned, and paid by them, making War
againſt them, and with their Swords in Hand controul their Maſters, and had
a Deſign to carry away the King from the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> but were
prevented by the General; the City, the Parliament's old Friends and
Aſſiſtants, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0319800400:187"/> are averſe towards them, and
queſtion their Integrity, reproach them, and would caſt them off; the King
writes to the Parliament, and taxes them for not anſwering his laſt
Meſſage, and earneſtly preſſes for a preſent Treaty, that Peace
might be ſettled, and lays the Retarding it upon them: The <hi>Scotch</hi>
Commiſſioners declare a joint Intereſt with the Parliament, for
ſettling a Peace in both Kingdoms, proteſt againſt the four Bills ſent
to the King, preſs for a preſent Treaty at <hi>London,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>Let that be given to</hi> God <hi>which is</hi> God<hi>'s, and that to</hi>
Caeſar <hi>which is</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s,</hi> and put them in Mind of their
profeſſed Loyalty. Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> has more ſtrict Orders to
ſecure the King, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the King's Servants which attended him are
diſcharged: Then the Parliament ſend Commiſſioners to the King, who
return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Satisfaction; and after a long Debate, the prevailing Party in
the Houſe of Commons vote no more Addreſſes to the King, and no
Meſſage or Letters to be received from him; and that it ſhould be High
Treaſon for any to deliver any Meſſage to the King, or receive any from
him, without the Leave of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and Collonel
<hi>Hammond,</hi> with Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Conſtable,</hi> had Orders to place
and diſplace ſuch Perſons about the King as they thought fit, which
highly diſcontented the King; but the Governour ſaid, he had Orders from
the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for it, whom he muſt obey.</p>
            <p>Soon after this the General preſents an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the
Parliament, in the Name of the <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0319800400:188"/> whole Army, that they
would ſtand by the Parliament, in making no more Addreſſes to the King;
and that they would intirely ſubmit to the Government of the Parliament. Thus
they are quickly made Friends again; and the Army had the Thanks of the
Houſes for their Addreſs; who ordered the King's Houſhold ſhould be
diſſolved, and the Navy no longer be called the King's Navy: Whereupon the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> (as they had Reaſon) refuſed to ſtrike Sail, as being
the elder State. Two Earls were named to go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to acquaint
that Kingdom with what the Parliament had done, and a Declaration was
publiſhed for no more Addreſſes to the King, wherein all the
Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the Government were named, from the King's firſt coming to
the Crown.</p>
            <p>Thus the Parliament and Army were made Friends, and well fixed
again, by the Cunning of of <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Party; but then the
Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, with others in <hi>London,</hi> made an Inſurrection againſt
the Parliament and Army, and great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were making in
<hi>Scotland</hi> for a War, declaring they would reſcue the King from
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, which was done contrary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of both Kingdoms;
and that the King might come to one of his own Houſes near <hi>London,</hi>
with Honour, Freedom, and Safety: And Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation came from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that the King's Party there was very ſtrong, and carried all, and that there
would be a general Riſing in that Kingdom, for Religion, King, and Church;
and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Order of their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0319800400:189"/> demanded, that the King might come to ſome of his
Courts near <hi>London,</hi> with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Honour, and Safety, and that a
perſonal Treaty be had with his Majeſty, and that the Independant
Schiſmatick Army might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, which governed all as they pleaſed.
Whereupon the Parliament returned Anſwer, That they would keep the Covenant
and the Treaty between the two Kingdoms, and that they would be ready to join
with <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Propoſitions preſented to the King at
<hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, or a little before, the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
made his Eſcape into <hi>Holland,</hi> and was very tenderly and kindly
received by the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> at whoſe Eſcape
the Parliament was very much troubled; and now Petitions came from ſeveral
Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and Riſings were in ſeveral Counties, and the
People in general were weary of the War, and would have a perſonal Treaty
with the King: And Riſings were not only at Land, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation came, that
ſeveral Ships were revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Rainſborough,</hi> whom they had
ſet on Shore, and ſent for the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to command them,
who was thereupon declared Admiral. Thus a new War was begun, and great
Diviſions and Perplexities were in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet the Riſings in
ſeveral Parts for the King not being well concerted, were ſtill quaſhed,
and did only ſerve to unite the Party ſtronger againſt the King. However,
the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſeeing that the People's Hearts were <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0319800400:190"/>
generally ſet againſt them, and that the revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ships at <hi>Deal</hi>
would not own them, finding their Backwardneſs for a perſonal Treaty with
the King, and that the City of <hi>London</hi> and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Trained
Bands, prayed the King might be brought to <hi>London,</hi> with Freedom,
Honour, and Safety, to treat with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the City would
engage for the Security of his Majeſty's Royal Perſon, and would alſo
undertake to keep the Parliament ſafe from all Tumults and Mutinery, and that
they would defend the King and Parliament in the Treaty, and defray the Charge
of the Guards during the Treaty, and find a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Place for the Treaty;
with many other Particulars: The Parliament hereupon began to think of a
Treaty, and to ſet aſide their Votes of Non-Addreſſes. In the mean
time, theſe ſeveral Petitions for Peace encouraged the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> with his Brother, with the Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Peterborough,</hi> to a Riſing about <hi>Kingſton,</hi> where they were
ſoon purſued, and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> (who had formerly had a
great Hand in bringing Straits upon the King and Kingdom, in the Beginning of
the War) now ſeeing the Parliament backward to a perſonal Treaty, hoped
they ſhould be able in the End to bring the Parliament to Reaſon: But the
Parliament's Army being old Soldiers, proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in their Attempts, and well
provided with all Neceſſaries, it was a deſperate Attempt to make Head
againſt them, without having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerted all things well; which was a 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0319800400:191"/> great Prejudice to the King's Affairs, there being
ſmall Truſt to be given to People's Promiſes in ſuch Occaſions, who
would not ſtir, unleſs they ſaw the Tide turning with ſome previous
Succeſs, which was at that time very unhappy to the King's Affairs in all
Parts; tho' nothing could be more honourable, juſt, and pious, than to
endeavour reſcuing our Country from the Miſery and Slavery it lay under;
and our Sins were certainly the Cauſe it took Effect, joined with the
Miſmanagement of thoſe who undertook it, without having firſt well
concerted for the carrying on that Deſign: So that the Earl of
<hi>Holland</hi>'s Party was totally defeated, himſelf with many others taken
Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and the Brother to the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and others
killed. Then Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> enters <hi>England</hi> with an Army, and
all join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him are declared Rebels. Here is a ſtrange Turn of Affairs,
to which all human Actions are ſubject. Great Endeavours were formerly
uſed, to bring in the <hi>Scots</hi> to aſſiſt the Parliament, and now
they invade <hi>England</hi> with a conſiderable Army; they joined before
with the Parliament againſt the King, and now they took with the King
againſt the Parliament. The People of this World are like the Sea, ſtill
eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing, always in an uncertain Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſtant in nothing but
Inconſtancy.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Duke of <hi>York</hi> did at this
time come to <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Road with divers Ships, and landed ſome Men,
but were beaten by the Parliament's Horſe, and ſeveral taken 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0319800400:192"/> Priſoners; but the Town reſcued them, and the reſt
of his Royal Highneſs's Men got into the Town. The Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi>
of <hi>Parham</hi> was on Ship-board, and commanded the Prince's Fleet, having
quitted the Parliament, upon their declining a perſonal Treaty; and when the
Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> came near him with the Parliament Fleet, the Lord
<hi>Willoughby</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earneſt to have fought, upon Aſſurance that
ſeveral in the Fleet would have revolted to his Royal Highneſs; but thoſe
that were about the Prince diſſwaded him from Fighting, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great
Danger to his Highneſs's Perſon, and ſo they carried it: Whereas, in all
Probability, (as the Seamens Affections then ſtood) the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament's Fleet
would have been endangered. The Prince then ſtopped ſeveral Merchants
Ships, and ſent to the Merchants Adventurers at <hi>London,</hi> for Twenty
Thouſand Pounds <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> to releaſe their Ships; and that he was
come with that Fleet, to endeavour to releaſe his Majeſty from his
Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>The Parliament ſeeing the General Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People was
for a Treaty, they fell from their Vote of Non-Addreſſes, and ordered a
perſonal Treaty with the King in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> with Honour,
Freedom, and Safety, in what Place there his Majeſty ſhould appoint, who
well approved of <hi>Newport,</hi> and received the Parliament
Commiſſioners with much Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, declaring, that no Man deſired a
Peace ſo much as he; and that he would hearken to any Motion that might
conduce to ſo good an <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0319800400:193"/> End, and that whoever gained by
the Troubles, he was ſure to be a Loſer; and challenged all Men to produce
the leaſt Colour of Reaſon, that he was againſt the Treaty. He then
ſaid, if it was Peace they deſired, he had ſhewed them the Way, by a
juſt Compliance with all their Intereſts. If they deſired Plenty and
Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they were the inſeparable Effects of Peace. If it was Security,
he offered the Militia for all his Time. If it was a Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he that wanted it moſt, was moſt willing to give it. If it was the right
Adminiſtration of Juſtice, all Officers and Offices of Truſt he left to
the Choice of the Parliament. If they would have frequent Parliaments, he fully
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred therewith. If they demanded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears of the Army which fought
againſt him, he fully agreed they ſhould be paid: So that all the World
might ſee his unwearied Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for Peace.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons agreed, that the Vote againſt farther
Addreſſes ſhould be recalled: That the King had choſen <hi>Newport</hi>
in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to treat with the Parliament's
Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and all ſuch Perſons ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as his
Majeſty ſhould think fit to ſend for: That Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
Inſtructions for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King ſhould be repealed, taking the King's
own Engagement for his going abroad in the Iſland, and Horſes, Coaches, and
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, both for the publick, and the King's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Uſe, were ſent to the
Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where the King kept a Faſt for a Bleſſing upon
the <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0319800400:194"/> Treaty, and agreed in every thing, except Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
wherein he let the Commiſſioners know how far he could condeſcend. Some
of the Commiſſioners then begged of the King upon their Knees, with Tears
in their Eyes, as to the Propoſition touching Religion, but Matter of
Conſcience prevailed more with the King than all their Arguments; of which
they gave an Account to the Parliament, who thereupon vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the King's
Conceſſions as to Religion, the Church, and <hi>Ireland,</hi> were
unſatisfactory. However, the Houſe of Commons voted, that a Committee
ſhould draw up ſomething for the King's coming to <hi>London,</hi> with
Inſtructions for the Terms of his Majeſty's being in Freedom, Honour, and
Safety: That the Committee ſhould alſo conſider of the King's Deſires
concerning his Revenues: That an Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion ſhould be preſented to
the King, to be paſſed with ſuch Limitations as ſhall be agreed by both
Houſes. The Houſe of Commons vote likewiſe, that the King ſhould come
to <hi>London,</hi> ſo ſoon as the Conceſſions in the Treaty were
agreed, and that the King ſhould have his Lands and Revenues made good to
him, according to the Laws; and that what he ſhould paſs away of his legal
Right, he ſhould have Allowance in Compenſation: And that an Act of
Oblivion ſhould be agreed upon. And both Houſes agreed to all theſe
Votes, and, in fine, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament voted, that the King's Conceſſions to
the Propoſitions of the Parliament upon the Treaty, were ſufficient Grounds
for ſettling the <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0319800400:195"/> Peace of the Kingdom, and they named
a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to go to the General and Head Quarters, to confer with the General
and Officers of the Army, for the Continuance of a good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
betwixt the Parliament and Army.</p>
            <p>But whilſt theſe things were doing, Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi>
ſends a Letter to the Parliament, with one incloſed from the General unto
him, requiring him to repair to his Excellency at the Head Quarters, and that
Collonel <hi>Ewre</hi> was appointed to take Charge of the King in the Iſle
of <hi>Wight.</hi> Hereupon the Commons voted, That Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi>
ſhould ſtay in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and continue his Charge, and
that the Admiral ſhould forthwith ſend Ships for Security of the Iſle of
<hi>Wight,</hi> and that they ſhould obey Collonel <hi>Hammond:</hi> But a
Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brought Word, that Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> was upon his Way to
<hi>Windſor,</hi> according to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Order, and that Collonel
<hi>Ewre</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his Majeſty's Perſon, and removed him to
<hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle, a pitiful Place, and moſt peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Air.
Hereupon the Parliament ſent a Letter to the General, acquainting him, that
thoſe Orders and Inſtructions from him to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Ewre,</hi> for
ſecuring the King's Perſon, were contrary to their Reſolution, and
freſh Inſtructions were ſent again by the Parliament to Collonel
<hi>Hammond,</hi> to return, and attend his Charge in the Iſle of
<hi>Wight</hi>; and that it was the Pleaſure of the Parliament, that his
Excellency ſhould recal his Orders, and that Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi>
ſhould again attend his <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0319800400:196"/> Charge; but Collonel
<hi>Hammond</hi> ſent Word to the Parliament, that he was detained at
<hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> and that Collonel <hi>Ewre</hi> had the Charge of the
King. At the ſame time the General wrote to the Lord Mayor of
<hi>London,</hi> that he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his March with his Army towards
<hi>London,</hi> and demanded Fourty Thouſand Pounds <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
immediately of the City, and that he would quarter his Army in the void
Houſes near the City, as <hi>Whitehall, St. James,</hi> the <hi>Mews, York
Houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Upon this Advance of the Army, all Perſons were full of
Perplexity, not knowing the End of it. The Parliament then declared the
ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the King's Royal Perſon was without their Advice, and againſt
their Conſent; and the Houſe being to ſit the next Day, Collonel
<hi>Pride,</hi> with ſeveral of his Regiments, ſtood in the Court of
Requeſts, upon the Stairs in the Lobby before the Houſe of Commons,
<hi>Pride</hi> having a Paper of Names in his Hand, and the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>
of <hi>Grooby</hi> ſtood by him, to inform him who the Members were; and
<hi>Pride</hi> ſeized upon ſuch as the Lord directed by his Note, and
ſent them away with Soldiers, by ſpecial Order from the General and Council
of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. The Houſe of Commons being informed of this, ſent their
Serjeant at Arms to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſeized upon, to let them know, it was the
Pleaſure of the Houſe, that they ſhould forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with attend the Service of
the Houſe, but they were ſtill detained by the Guard of Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0319800400:197"/>The Army having thus ejected the greateſt
and beſt Part of the Houſe of Commons, brought the reſt ſo to their
Will, whom they permitted to ſit, that they acted nothing but by their
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, and in purſuance of their Deſigns, which were to ſubvert
Monarchy, and to bury it in one Grave with the King; and having contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with
this Juncto of the Houſe of Commons, how to bring the King to his End, which
they ſoon reſolved upon, with a ſtrange unheard of Impudence, in a
pretended Way of Juſtice, (whoſe Death the Juncto had long before
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon) and their Deſign being now ripe, a Reſolution was taken,
which amazed the whole Chriſtian World, of which paſt Ages had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any
Precedent, nor may any future Age take Example by this moſt barbarous and
hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Cruelty, to bring a juſt King, their lawful Sovereign (who prized his
Subjects Liberties and Welfare before his own Life) to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by his
moſt rebellious Subjects, and condemned to die, by a pretended Legality and
Cloak of Juſtice, with mock Formalities of Law, and Villainy of ſo deep a
Dye, that all the World bluſh at, being the Maſterpiece of all Iniquities,
which they thought better than to have poiſoned their King in
<hi>Carisbrook</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>And when the nauſeous peſtilential Air of <hi>Hurſt</hi>
Caſtle effected not what they deſigned, then they carried him with a
ſtrong Guard to <hi>Windſor,</hi> in order to his intended Tryal, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him not only the Ceremony of the Knee, but even the common Civility of the
Hat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0319800400:198"/>The King being brought from
<hi>Windſor</hi> to <hi>St. James,</hi> their Juncto of Parliament proceed to
Votes in order to his Tryal, and declare, That by the fundamental Laws of the
Land, it was Treaſon in the King of <hi>England,</hi> to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy War againſt
his Parliament and Kingdom, and all the Blood ſpilt was by the Juncto laid
upon the King, who was the greateſt Sufferer in the War, which was made and
begun upon him; and what the King did, was purely in his own Defence, who
endeavoured to ſtop that Flux of Blood, by a Treaty with his two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of
Parliament, which was agreed upon, but hindered by the imperious Army, who were
ſo audacious, as to ſtyle the King, in their unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled rebellious
Remonſtrance, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's capital Enemy, who was formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for
yielding too little to his Parliament, and was now to be condemned by the Army,
for yielding too much: He was formerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for making War, and now
was to be condemned for making Peace: He was at firſt condemned for having
evil Counſellours, and was now to be condemned, having no Counſel; and all
this to be done by Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, who pretended only Zeal, when
their Hearts were filled with Blood, and were reſolved from Servants to
become Maſters, to bring in Democracy, by aboliſhing Monarchy, declaring in
their Charge, by that impudent Arch-Traitor <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> That the King
of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is entruſted by the People with a limited Power to
govern according to the Laws of the <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0319800400:199"/> Land, and not
otherwiſe; and that by his Truſt, Oath, and Office, he is obliged to uſe
the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er committed to him, for the Good and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the People, and for
Preſervation of their Rights and Liberties; and where the King fails in any
of theſe, and rules and governs according to his Will, he thereby commits
Treaſon, and may be impeached as a Traitor and Murderer: A Doctrine never
heard of before, even amongſt the moſt barbarous Nations, it evidently
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, that the Authority of Kings is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately derived from God, and
not conferred upon them as a Truſt from the People. They are called the
<hi>Miniſters of God, and the Powers that be are ordained of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God firſt ſubjected his own People to the Government of
Kings, the People had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in conferring the Power. <hi>Moſes</hi>
was made King and Ruler by God himſelf; ſo <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the
<hi>Judges</hi>; for ſo long Theocracy did continue viſible amongſt Men:
And when the People deſired a King, God was not angry with them for
deſiring it, for he had before told them, that they ſhould have a King, but
for ſome Irregularities in the Manner of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring it; neither was
the King choſen by the People, but by Lot, and no Hand of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in
chuſing him. <hi>David</hi> was made King by God's immediate Choice; but
after him the Government deſcended by Succeſſion: And no Hiſtory either
ſacred or profane, can ſhew any Footſteps, that the People did entruſt
their Power to their Kings; which Suppoſition is <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0319800400:200"/> built
upon the mere Strength of their own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. And if we take a View of all
the Ways whereby Princes aſcend to the Throne, it will appear they are but
few; and yet in none of them the People confer the Power on the King.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by Deſcent and Succeſſion, as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the People do not confer the Power. I know very well, at the King's Coronation,
the Conſent of the People is demanded; yet the King is King to all Intents
and Purpoſes before his Coronation. Beſides, all the People are not
ſummoned, nor any conſiderable Part of them appear at the Coronation: And
if any ſhould reject his Prince, that would not hinder the Coronation, which
is barely a thing of Courſe, and does not deduce the King's Power from the
People. Nay, ſome Kings have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their Coronation, being only a
Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. In the next Place, if a King gets the Crown by Conqueſt, no Man
can ſay, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Crown by Conſent of the People, tho' there be a
tacit Conſent in their yielding him Obedience. As for thoſe who ſurprize
a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Fraud, they may impoſe upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo as to gain a
formal Conſent, yet there is not a real Conſent in thoſe that are thus
cajoled by the People, who had a Hand in bringing them in.</p>
            <p>There are ſome that come to the Crown by Election, and here the
People think the King derives his Power from them, believing the Throne was
vacant, and make Stipulations with him that is to govern: But we muſt
conſider, <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0319800400:201"/> that there is much Difference betwixt
deſigning the Perſon, and conferring the Power; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is from them
that chuſe, the latter by no means. The Dean and Chapter of a Cathedral, by
the King's Leave, chuſe a Biſhop, <hi>Sede va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante</hi>; this Choice
deſigns the Perſon, but does not confer the Power, which is afterwards
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in his Conſecration. The Aldermen and Commons of a City do yearly
chuſe their Mayors; this Choice ſhews the Perſon, but does not confer the
Power, which he hath by the King's Charter. When the Electors chuſe an
Emperor, or the States of <hi>Poland</hi> chuſe their King, they only
deſign his Perſon, his Power is not from them, but immediately from God.
But ſuppoſing that, in the firſt Inſtitution of Monarchy, the People
did confer the Power upon the Prince, it doth not therefore follow, that it
lyes in the Power of the People to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it; tho' this was unlawfully
maintained againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and ſince by ſome People
holding the ſame Principles, who would have the King's Power to be a Truſt
committed to him by the People, and ſo revocable; which is a very falſe
Suppoſition, and the Superſtructure upon it muſt needs fall in Courſe;
and yet ſuppoſing it was true, the Revocableneſs does not follow.</p>
            <p>Both Law and Reaſon tell us, that what is abſolutely conferred
in any Compact, is not to be revoked. When the Aldermen and Common Council have
choſen a Lord Mayor, it does not lye in their Power to reaſſume the
Truſt into their own Hands: When the Knights of the <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0319800400:202"/>
Shire are choſen to ſit in Parliament, it does not lye in the Freeholders
Power afterwards to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal their Truſt: They might have forbore to commit the
Truſt, but they cannot recal it. Then the Accountableneſs of Princes to
their People, in their Repreſentatives, hath paſſed for current Doctrine
in the laſt Age, by Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, Trying, and Condemning their lawful King;
whereas no earthly Power can juſtly call their King in Queſtion, God
Almighty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Ruler of Princes, and to him alone they owe their
Accounts, by whom all Kings reign, and cannot be called to any Account in this
World, but by the Stings of their own Conſciences: And it is a plain
Contradiction, after we have owned the King to be Supreme, to affirm there is
any other Superior to him, that can call him to an Account; it being a known
Maxim, <hi>Par in parem not habet Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem.</hi> If then the King be
Supreme, and there be others in his Kingdom that are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to him, then he
is Supreme and not Supreme: But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pretend they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Stipulations of a conditional Obedience, provided the King maintains their
Rights; ſo that the King not performing the former, they are not bound to the
latter: Whereas we are certainly bound to Subjection irreſpectively, to a
<hi>Caligula,</hi> as well as to an <hi>Auguſtus</hi>; to cruel <hi>Nero</hi>
and <hi>Domitian,</hi> as well as to courteous <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>; to the
Apoſtate <hi>Julian,</hi> as well as to Chriſtian <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
becauſe they have equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Power from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0319800400:203"/>The <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to pray for
the Proſperity of their Governours, and the Peace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
for the Lives of <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> and <hi>Balthazar</hi>; and this was
performed in the firſt and pureſt Ages. They were to pray for their
Emperors and Kings irreſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Religion, or Opinions in it, even
for their Heathen Perſecutors: And if they muſt pray for them, they muſt
not certainly take up Arms againſt them: And if we muſt not touch the
Lord's Anointed, our Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him is contrary to our not
touching him. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is certainly a competent Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for
<hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>;
for <hi>Valerianus</hi> and <hi>Gallienus</hi>; the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church
prayed for <hi>Alericus,</hi> the Eaſtern for the Emperor <hi>Valerius,</hi>
an <hi>Arian,</hi> and for <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Younger, and
<hi>Valentinian</hi> III. the one a <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> the other a
diſſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and their Prayers were, that God would grant them long
Life and a ſecure Reign, and preſerve their Families in Safety, and their
Government in Peace; which are perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Attempts on
their Perſons, or Practices to diſturb the Tranquillity of their
Government. The very endeavouring it, is perfectly oppoſite to the Tenor of
the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the Goſpel. King <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thoſe two great Sins, of Murder and Adultery, either of which ſingly was
capital by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law; and yet we do not find him called to an
Account for them. Nay, in his penitential Confeſſion, he only looks up to 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0319800400:204"/> God, and ſays, <hi>Againſt thee only have I
ſinned:</hi> Which is an Inſtance by which all Men ſhould be guided.
Beſides, for the People to have a Power to call their Prince to an Account,
is highly inconſiſtent with the Law of Nature, and is againſt all
Reaſon and Conſcience; for by this the People are both Complainants,
Witneſſes, Jury and Judges; a thing never heard of in any judicial
Proceeding: And yet that helliſh Juncto of Parliament made a High Court of
Juſtice (as they called what was the Height of Injuſtice, and the utmoſt
Wickedneſs) to Try and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their lawful Sovereign: Such was the
monſtrous Impiety of the laſt Age! when that incomparable Monarch, the
Honour of the World, was forced to bow down his Head, and fall a ſad
Sacrifice to the Fury of the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Villains that ever appeared upon
the Stage of this World, when Men threw away a Felicity always to be reflected
on, but never to be recovered, to the World's End.</p>
            <p>Thus fell the beſt of Kings, whoſe Greatneſs of Judgment, as
well as that of his Condition, did eminently appear at his Death, in the
Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his Nature, even in pardoning the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Malice of his
moſt inveterate Enemies, who were not ſatisfied with his Blood, but
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged the beſt of Governments, and brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation nothing but Confuſion and Miſery. And having thus murdered their
King, they took Poſſeſſion of his Kingdom, diſinherited (as much as
in them lay) the lawful Heir, and by their Proclamation declared themſelves a
Free <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0319800400:205"/> State. But before I go farther, give me Leave to
give you this King's Character.</p>
            <p>He was no great Scholar, his Learning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted more in what
he had ſeen, than what he had ſtudied: His Judgment was good, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than moſt of his Miniſters. The Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, that he ſeldom depended
upon it, unleſs in Matters of his own Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was always very
ſtiff. His Arguing was beyond Meaſure civil and patient. He would ſeldom
or never contradict any Man angrily, but would always ſay, by your Favour, I
think otherwiſe, or, I am not of your Opinion. He would diſcourage any bold
Addreſs that was made to him, and did not love Strangers; and whilſt he was
upon his Throne, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none to enter abruptly with him into
Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. He was wiſer than moſt of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, yet ſo unhappy as
ſeldom to follow his own Judgment. He would always (whilſt in his Court, be
addreſſed to by proper Miniſters, and ſtill kept up the Dignity of his
Court, limiting all Perſons to Places ſuitable to their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and
Quality, and would there only hear them, unleſs he called for them in
particular. Beſides the Ladies and Women who attended the King, he permitted
no Miniſter to have his Wife in Court. He ſpake but ſlowly, and would
ſtammer a little, when he began to ſpeak eagerly. He ſeldom or never made
his own Diſpatches, till his latter Days, but would ſtill mend and alter
them; and to that Purpoſe he would often ſay, he found it better to be a 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0319800400:206"/> Cabler, than a Shoemaker. As to his Religion, he was
very poſitive in it, and would bear no Arguments againſt it.</p>
            <p>When the Juncto had finiſhed their ſad Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, we ſoon
ſaw what followed their diſmal Actings; for, having got the ſupreme Power
into their Hands, they were reſolved to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act all thoſe who ſhould
oppoſe their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Proceedings: Neither could there be then a greater
Crime than Loyalty, whilſt That was only made Treaſon; and the Servants
having got the Sword into their Hands, they reſolved to improve it to their
Security: And having then a Set of Men fit for their Turns, which were the
Juncto, they would be ſure that none of thoſe who concluded the late King's
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions a ſufficient Ground for Settlement of Peace, ſhould ſit
amongſt them, but ſhould be voted out of the Houſe, and be no more
admitted to ſit as Members: And having thus ſettled their own Houſe,
they, in the next Place, fell upon the Houſe of Lords, and vote, That the
Houſe of Peers in Parliament was uſeleſs and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and by an Act of
theirs did aboliſh it; but yet, that they might have the Privilege to be
elected Knights of the Shire and Burgeſſes; which was firſt willingly
embraced by the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (who would play at ſmall Game
rather than ſit out) but the reſt of the Lords, ſenſible of that
ſtrange Alteration of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Government of the Nation, publiſhed
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Proteſtation againſt it,
in the Name of all the Peers of the Realm, being a treaſonable 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0319800400:207"/> Proceeding, and tyrannical Uſurpation, of ſome
Members of the Houſe of Commons, being a few inſolent and traitorous
Members of that Houſe, while the better and greateſt Part of the Houſe
were forcibly detained from thence. But it was in vain to think, by
Proteſtation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Men to Reaſon, who had Swords by their
Sides, and were reſolved to overcome, or periſh, in Maintainance of their
uſurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and aboliſhing whatever was right, as moſt likely to
oppoſe their Intruſion: And therefore they declared, in the Name of the
Commons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parliament (tho' they were not the
tenth Part of their Number) that they found by Experience, the Office of a King
in <hi>England,</hi> and to have the Power thereof in any one ſingle
Perſon, was unneceſſary, and dangerous to the Liberty, Safety, Religion,
and the publick Intereſt of the Nation, and therefore ſhould be
aboliſhed: And to the End that all Perſons might more readily yield
Obedience to their uſurped Power, they were abſolved from all Oaths made to
their late Sovereign and his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Thus this ſmall Part of a ſeeming Parliament (which was
actually diſſolved by the King's Death) acted by the Dictates of the
Council of War, for the Juncto were only the Wheels of the Government, guided
by the Will and Pleaſure of the Army; or rather their Tools by which they
acted, who yet thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not ſtrong enough, till a third Power
was ſet up by them, to ſtrengthen them in their <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0319800400:208"/>
Uſurpation. This they called a Council of State, conſiſting of Forty
Perſons, moſt of which were principal Officers of the Army, to whom Power
was given to ſettle the Militia of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
to diſpoſe of it from time to time, as they ſhould think fit, and that
they ſhould execute their Powers for a Year; and an Oath was made, whereby
each Member admitted to that Council, was to declare, That he approved what the
Houſe of Commons and their High Court of Juſtice had done againſt the
late King, and their aboliſhing the Kingly Government and Houſe of Lords;
and that the legiſlative and ſupreme Power was wholly in the Houſe of
Commons. This Oath Twenty One of the Forty they had named refuſed to take,
but their Number was ſoon filled up by them of as large Conſciences as
themſelves.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Cromwell</hi> having been victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and almoſt conquered all there, left his Son-in-Law,
<hi>Ireton,</hi> Deputy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to perfect the Conqueſt of that
Kingdom, and comes over himſelf to <hi>London,</hi> where he was much
careſſed by all the Officers of the new Commonwealth (for ſo the Juncto
had declared <hi>England</hi> to be) and now the Juncto fearing leſt
<hi>Charles</hi> II. ſhould join Intereſt with the <hi>Scots,</hi> they
provided againſt a Storm from thence, and ordered a conſiderable Body of
their Troops to lye upon the Borders near <hi>Scotland</hi>; and having an
Account that the <hi>Scots</hi> had modelled an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with which they were
preparing to enter <hi>England, Cromwell,</hi> with ſome other General 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0319800400:209"/> Officers, were appointed to meet and confer with General
<hi>Fairfax,</hi> and to perſwade him, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army then
upon the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> might forthwith enter into that Kingdom,
and carry the War into their Country: But the General would not be ſatisfied
in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to do that, being of the ſame Religion with them,
notwithſtanding all the Arguments that <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the other
Officers could uſe to perſwade him. In fine, he told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he
would rather lay down his Commiſſion than agree with them (which was indeed
the great Deſign of thoſe Officers that then met) and ſo they would
preſs the General no farther, whoſe Commiſſion was preſently accepted
by the Juncto of Parliament, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> was made forthwith General
in <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Place; and being General, he readily marched with his
Army Northwards, to the great Amazement of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who fearing an
Invaſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Covenant and the Articles of Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by which
they ought not to be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without three Months Warning.</p>
            <p>The firſt News that General <hi>Cromwell</hi> heard from
<hi>Scotland</hi> was, that King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was landed there, and
received as their King; and that it was reſolved to invade <hi>England,</hi>
if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army did not invade them: But that the <hi>Scots</hi>
firſt thought fit to ſend to the Juncto of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to know whether the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Marching towards <hi>Scotland</hi> was in a Defenſive or
an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Way? Whereupon the Juncto publiſhed, in a Declaration, their
Reaſons for their Army <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0319800400:210"/> marching Northwards. The
<hi>Scots</hi> forthwith choſe a particular Council, by whoſe Advice and
Direction their King was to govern; who gave ſuch general Satisfaction to the
<hi>Scots,</hi> that by Proclamation publiſhed at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Croſs,
they gave the King all his Royal Power; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Cromwell</hi> advanced,
and ſent his Reaſons into <hi>Scotland,</hi> of his March with his Army
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Kingdom, and ſoon after advanced to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where both
Armies were near each other; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> beginning to want
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, <hi>Cromwell</hi> reſolved to retreat, before his Army was put
to Extremity. But the <hi>Scots</hi> preſſed hard upon them, and the
Preſbyterian Miniſters in the Army encouraged the <hi>Scots</hi> to fight,
contrary to the Opinion of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and other principal Officers, who
adviſed rather to make a Bridge for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army to paſs
quietly homewards, than to hinder or oppoſe them. But the Miniſters carried
for Fighting; and the Day before the Engagement, the <hi>Scots</hi> ſeemed
ſo ſure of Victory (by Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from their Miniſters, who ſaid it
was the Lord's Battle) that they conſulted of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Propoſitions to
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they ſhould have Leave to paſs into
<hi>England</hi> with their Swords only, leaving their Cannon and Ammunition
behind them. 'Tis true, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were then in a very ſad
Condition, many ſick and wanting Proviſions, the Paſſes before them
ſtopt, the <hi>Scots</hi> Army on one Side of them, the Sea on the other, and
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> behind them. The General ſeeing no Way to 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0319800400:211"/> eſcape, without making his Way thro' them, reſolved
to fight, in that deſperate Condition, and after one Hour's warm Diſpute,
the <hi>Scots</hi> were defeated, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> obtained an
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Victory, whereby the Scene was ſo much changed, that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were forced to break the Pikes and Muſkets they took, not
having Conveniency of ſending them for <hi>England.</hi> It ſeems the
<hi>Scots</hi> purſued the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and
preſſed ſo hard upon them (thinking they had them in a Net) that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> could not retire without fighting; by which they got ſo
compleat a Victory, that General <hi>Cromwell</hi> was Maſter, that very Day,
both of <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The News of this Defeat being brought to the King, he was
pleaſed to ſay, he thanked God he was ſo rid of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that
their Kirk might then ſee their Error in prohibiting their King from being in
Perſon with their Army, and keeping out the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the
reſt of the King's Followers, who, in all Probability, had prevented their
great Misfortune. However, their King was crowned ſoon after at
<hi>Scone,</hi> tho' the <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſters preached, that their
Defeat was occaſioned by their too much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their King, to whom
moſt of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords adhered: But ſome Commanders with the
Kirk were of a contrary Opinion, and would by all means purge the King's
Houſhold. However, the <hi>Scots</hi> raiſe a new Army, whom the King in
Perſon would command; the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> is made Lieutenant
General, <hi>David</hi> 
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0319800400:212"/> 
               <hi>Leſley</hi> Major General,
<hi>Middleton</hi> Lieutenant General of the Horſe, and <hi>Maſſy</hi>
Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and with this Army the King hoped to
get bye the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to make the Seat of the War in
<hi>England.</hi> But after a long and terrible March, wherein were ſeveral
Engagements, with different Succeſs, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> being in the
Rear, and on all Sides of the <hi>Scots</hi>; ſo that moſt of the
Engagements were to the King's Diſadvantage, who at laſt arrived at
<hi>Worceſter</hi> with his ſhattered Army, where he was beaten by General
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Third Day of <hi>September,</hi> as he had done the Year
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at <hi>Dunbar.</hi> After this total Defeat, the King eſcaped, and
was miraculouſly preſerved for a better Fortune, and to ſee the Murderers
of his late Royal Father, at leaſt ſome of the principal of them, moſt
juſtly and deſervedly puniſhed.</p>
            <p>After the Succeſs of this Battle, General <hi>Cromwell</hi> went
to <hi>London,</hi> and was highly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed by all, and having then a
Vacation from military Labours, he had Time to juggle with his Officers, to
advance his Power; for tho' he then governed as King, and the Juncto of
Parliament acted only according to his Dictates, yet he ſeemed not ſo great
as he deſired, whilſt he only acted as Maſter, under the Title of a
Servant; and finding the Juncto did not proceed in all things according to his
Mind, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take the Power wholly into his own Hands, that it might
clearly appear what he was in effect: And to this Purpoſe he got the 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0319800400:213"/> Conſent of moſt of the Officers of the Army, who
were his Creatures, to be willing he ſhould break the Juncto of Parliament.
But before he would execute any Part of this, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf he had
long before deſigned, and now being ripe for Execution, he held a long
Conference with an eminent Perſon, upon whoſe Opinion and Judgment he much
relied, and declared to him his Diſſatisfaction with the Parliament's
Proceedings, and that he would do nothing therein without his Advice, who was
at this time a Member of Parliament, and in great Eſteem among them. This
Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with whom <hi>Cromwell</hi> then conferred, told him freely, that
ſince he governed all at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that the Juncto of Parliament did
nothing without his Conſent, he thought it beſt that he ſhould continue
General as he was, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the whole Government in his Hands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he
would take upon him the Title of King, and then he might govern ſafely, and
thoſe that ſerved under him would be in no Danger, he being King <hi>de
facto,</hi> according to an Act of Parliament made in the Eleventh of
<hi>Henry</hi> VII. which was ſtill in Force: But <hi>Cromwell</hi>
abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed this, becauſe he knew he could never get the Officers
of the Army their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, nor ſome of his own near Relations, who
ſwore they would kill him, if ever he took that Title upon him. This
Conference puts me in Mind of what Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> ſaid to the Lord
<hi>Digby,</hi> in the Beginning of the War, as they were going down the
Parliament Stairs. <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0319800400:214"/> 
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> going juſt before
them, the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> (who was then a great Man in the Houſe of
Commons) aſked <hi>Hambden,</hi> who that Man was? <hi>for I ſee,</hi>
ſaith the Lord <hi>Digby, he is of our Side, by his ſpeaking ſo warmly
this Day:</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> replied, <hi>That ſloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fellow, which you ſee before us, who hath no Ornament in his Speech: I ſay,
that Sloven, if we ſhould ever come to have a Breach with the King, (which
God forbid) I ſay, that Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in ſuch Caſe, will be one of the
greateſt Men of</hi> England; which was a prophetical Speech: But
<hi>Hambden</hi> knew him well, and was intimately acquainted with him.</p>
            <p>Now, after this Conference between <hi>Cromwell</hi> and that
other Perſon, a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, finding <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s
Averſeneſs to what he propoſed, he told him, there was but one other Way
that he knew, whereby <hi>Cromwell</hi> might make himſelf and Family as
great as he pleaſed, but that he would not propoſe it, without firſt
having an Aſſurance from his Excellency, that he would not take it ill what
he ſhould ſay, nor mention it to any other; both which <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
promiſed him upon his Faith and Honour: And when the Gentleman diſcloſed
himſelf farther to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> advertizing him what he might do, to
his own eternal Honour, and to what Advantage he pleaſed, for all his Family,
his Excellency told the Gentleman, that it was a Matter of the greateſt
Importance, and would require a good Time to conſider of it. But his
Excellency never ſpoke one Word more to that <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0319800400:215"/> Gentleman
about it; and finding by that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Diſcourſe, that he was not like
to approve of what he intended, his Excellency ſoon found a Way to have him
ſent a foreign Ambaſſador, whilſt he continued his firſt
Reſolution; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, he firſt erects a Council of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who
expoſtulate with the Parliament about their Arrears, and the Diſſolution
of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which occaſioned a long Debate in the Houſe, where it
was reſolved they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their Power: Whereupon General
<hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> in the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1653, comes into the Houſe
with ſome of his Generals, and a File of Muſqueteers, and diſſolves the
Juncto of Parliament, and after declares his Reaſons for it, to give the
People Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In this he was obeyed, tho' with ſome Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and Reluctancy
of the Members. He then bid his Soldiers take away the Fool's Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, their
Mace. The Speaker being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave his Chair, was pulled out of it by
Collonel <hi>Harriſon,</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſat down in it, and
ſtayed in the Houſe, till he ſaw all the Members out, and then he
cauſed the Doors to be locked up, to the great Content of the Nation, who
then judged a worſe Slavery could not befal them, tho' they expected little
Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Freedom from him into whoſe Hands the Power then fell. This
Action was certainly a much higher Affront than what the Houſe of Commons
took ſo ill from the late King, that one of their own Members ſhould ſo
violently turn them all out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0319800400:216"/>Thus this Juncto of Parliament was at this
time treated by thoſe that had ſet them up, and took their Commiſſions
and Authority from them; nor could the Army juſtify any Action they had done,
or one Drop of Blood they had ſpilt, but by their Authority. The Servants
roſe up againſt their Maſters, and diſſolved that Power by which they
were created Officers and Soldiers, and then the Army took (what they had long
ſince deſigned) all Power into their own Hands; and after the Parliament
had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all their Enemies, they were overthrown and ruined by their own
Servants, and thoſe whom they had raiſed, pulled down their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; an
Example very ſtrange! by which we ſee how uncertain all worldly Affairs
are, and how apt to fall, when they think them at the higheſt Point: And
ſoon after this Diſſolution, the General gave his Reaſons in Print to
ſatisfy the Nation why he had diſſolved them, in a long Declaration.</p>
            <p>By this Diſſolution, <hi>Cromwell</hi> was poſſeſſed
of the Three Kingdoms, having both the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and military Power in his
Hands; and therefore he thought fit to chuſe ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be the
ſupreme Government, who met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and called
themſelves a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and choſe one Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> for their
Speaker, who had the uſual Ceremonies belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to that Office, and this was
by Nick-name called <hi>Barebone</hi>'s Parliament, becauſe he was a Member
of it, being at that time a Leather-Seller in <hi>Fleetſtreet.</hi> But this
Parliament not <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0319800400:217"/> agreeing amongſt themſelves, (tho'
they were but an Hundred and Forty) after ſome ſhort Time, they reſign
their Power to <hi>Cromwell</hi> who gave it them. Then <hi>Cromwell</hi> is
declared by his Council, or by the Inſtrument of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they called
it, Protector of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and proclaimed ſo in the uſual Places as the Kings
formerly were; and in this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Manner he mounted the Throne of the
Three Kingdoms, without the Name of a King, but with greater Power and
Authority than any King, and received greater Eſteem and Reſpect from all
the Princes of Chriſtendom, than ever had been ſhewed to any Monarch of the
Three Nations: For tho' they all abhorred him, yet they trembled at his Power,
and courted his Friendſhip. After he had ſufficiently beaten the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> he made a Peace with them, and obliged <hi>Portugal</hi> to
ſend an Ambaſſador to make Peace, and proſecuted all thoſe of the
King's Party that were at home, with the utmoſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Cruelty, and
erected a High Court of Juſtice, for Tryal of ſuch as ſhould riſe, or
plot any thing againſt him, and many were executed upon that Account. He made
his youngeſt Son <hi>Henry</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> But
<hi>England</hi> proved not ſo as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for the moſt conſiderable
Men that were in the Houſe of Commons, from the time that he diſſolved
them, poiſoned the Affections of the People towards the Government, and yet
carried themſelves ſo warily, that they did <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0319800400:218"/> not
diſturb the Peace of the Nation. And tho' <hi>Cromwell</hi> was then
poſſeſſed of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, yet he thought himſelf not
ſecure, till he had the Conſent of the People in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and
therefore, according to his Power in the Inſtrument of Government, he
ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Parliament, which met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Third Day
of <hi>September</hi> 1654, the famous Day of his two great Victories at
<hi>Dunbar</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and in this Parliament
<hi>Lenthall</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Speaker. This he thought was the only Way to
have the People entirely ſubmit to him, and he ordered it ſo, that no
Perſon who had ever been againſt the Parliament, during the time of the
Civil War, or the Sons of any ſuch Perſon, ſhould be choſen.
<hi>Cromwell</hi> came into the Houſe, and allowed the Speaker: The firſt
Speech that was made amongſt them, was to know by what Authority they came
thither? And whether he that had convened them, had a lawful Power to do it?
And tho' the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's Creatures endeavoured to direct them, yet many of the
Members declared againſt the Power: And one more bold than others ſaid,
<hi>That as God had made him inſtrumental of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down Tyranny in one
Man; ſo now he could not endure to ſee the Nation's Liberties ſhackled by
another, who had no Right to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by the Length of his
Sword.</hi> The Continuance of this warm Debate laſted for ſome Days, which
much perplexed the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, who ſent for the Parliament to him in the
<hi>Banqueting-Houſe,</hi> and told them in his canting <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0319800400:219"/> Tone, that he was ſorry to hear they were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Heats and
Diviſions, and declared, that the ſame Government that made him Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
had made them a Parliament; and that therefore no Man was to ſit in that
Houſe, that did not firſt take an Engagement, which he had cauſed to be
made, which many refuſed to take, as being againſt their Privileges, and a
Guard was ſet at the Door of the Houſe, that none ſhould enter that had
not taken it; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding many refuſed entering upon that Account,
yet the Reſidue proved ſo reſty, that he was obliged to diſſolve
them; which he did, and ſaid, he could do his Buſineſs without them. It
was about this time, that <hi>Wildman</hi> and <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> the two great
Levellers, were taken and proſecuted, but <hi>Lilburn</hi> more ſeverely
than the other; and tho' he was accuſed and tryed for High-Treaſon, yet the
Jury found him Not Guilty. He told the People at his Tryal, <hi>That all</hi>
Engliſhmen <hi>were obliged to oppoſe</hi> Cromwell<hi>'s Tyranny, as he
had done purely for their ſakes, to preſerve them from being Slaves:</hi>
And tho' he was acquitted, yet <hi>Cromwell</hi> never ſuffered him to be
ſet at Liberty, but ſtill kept him incloſed from Priſon to Priſon,
till he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf died.</p>
            <p>After the Diſſolution of the Parliament, <hi>Cromwell</hi> not
thinking himſelf ſecure in the Government, he invented a new Chimera to
keep the People in Awe, which was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by the Major Generals, and
the whole Kingdom was divided amongſt them, being <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0319800400:220"/>
Eleven in all: Theſe were principally employed to decimate Delinquents
Eſtates, and gave them great Power to value what the Tenth Part of every
ſuch Eſtate did amount to, and every Man was to pay what they thought fit,
and upon Neglect, the Perſon to be impriſoned, and his whole Eſtate
ſequeſtered. But finding theſe Major Generals were very odious to all
Parties, and fearing they might in the End undermine his own Greatneſs, and
govern like <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Baſſaws, he ſoon put an End to their
Power, believing they eclipſed his Glory.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Jews</hi> offered <hi>Cromwell</hi> a great Sum of
Money, that they might be permitted to traffick freely; but the City and
principal Merchants therein being much againſt it, that Project failed him.
After, in the Year 1656, <hi>Cromwell</hi> (who was then called Protector of
the Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c.)
ſummoned another Parliament, who met accordingly, and remembring the Speeches
and Carriages of many Members of the late Parliament, he gave ſecret Advice
to the Sheriffs of the ſeveral Counties, to hinder, if poſſible, their
being choſen; but this Advice proved fruitleſs in moſt Places. However,
the Parliament met, and before they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enter the Houſe, they
were to ſubſcribe a Recognition, that they would act nothing that was
prejudicial to the Government, as eſtabliſhed by a Protector: Whereupon
many Members choſe rather to return home; but the Major Part ſigned the
Recognition, entered the <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0319800400:221"/> Houſe, and choſe Sir
<hi>Thomas Withrington</hi> Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who acted ſuitably to the Protector's
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in every thing. The Parliament preſſed <hi>Cromwell</hi>
mightily to be King, which <hi>Cromwell</hi> poſitively refuſed; but his
Refuſal ſeemed not in the leaſt diſadvantageous; for that by a new
Inſtrument, which was called the Humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Advice, they granted
him not only the Authority of Protector for his Life, but alſo a Power to
declare his Succeſſor; and when they had agreed upon this, they deſired
an Audience, which he gave them in the <hi>Banqueting-Houſe,</hi> the Twenty
Fifth of <hi>May</hi> 1657, where their Speaker, <hi>Withrington,</hi>
preſented and read the Petition and Advice of his Parliament, and deſired
his Aſſent to it, which the Protector then ſigned, and made a long
Harangue to them, and was ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated in
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and adjourned the Parliament till
<hi>January</hi> following.</p>
            <p>And thus the Parliament having done all that could be expected
from them, he would do ſomething for himſelf, whoſe Greatneſs, in that
Vacancy, was ſo well eſtabliſhed, both at Home and Abroad, that it
ſeemed as if it could never be ſhaken. He was confirmed in his Power with
the Title of Protector, and took his Oath accordingly, and was proclaimed
Protector in the uſual Places as the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were, and ſolemnly
inaugurated in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>January</hi> the Parliament met; but new Inſtitutions in
Government are often unſecure, for a Gap was left open, which none of the 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0319800400:222"/> Contrivers of the new Government thought of, there being
one Article in <hi>The Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and Advice,</hi> to which
<hi>Cromwell</hi> had aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſworn, <hi>That no Member lawfully
choſen ſhould be excluded, but by the Conſent of that Houſe of which he
was a Member</hi>; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the calling over their Houſe, all
thoſe who had been before refuſed Entrance, for not ſigning the
Recognition, were admitted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by above One Hundred of the moſt inveterate
Enemies of the Protector came and ſat in the Houſe: But <hi>Cromwell</hi>
thought he had ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for his Security, to reſtrain the
Inſolency of the Houſe of Commons, by having called the other Houſe,
which by the Petition and Advice was to be done, and filled it for the moſt
Part with Officers of the Army, and of his ſureſt Friends, and that were
firmly fixed to the Protector's Intereſt.</p>
            <p>When the Adjournment ended, and the Houſes met,
<hi>Cromwell</hi> came to the Upper Houſe, and ſent the Black Rod for the
Houſe of Commons to attend him; and being in his Chair of State, he began his
Speech in the old Style, <hi>My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons.</hi> So ſoon as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
returned to their Houſe, they began to queſtion the Authority and
Juriſdiction of the other Houſe: That tho' the Petition and Advice admitted
there ſhould be another Houſe, but that it ſhould be a Houſe of Peers,
and they be called My Lords, there was no ſuch Proviſion; nor did it appear
what Juriſdiction they ſhould <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0319800400:223"/> have; and that it
would be ridiculous for them, who ſat only by their Vote, no better Men than
themſelves, to have a negative Voice to controul their Maſters; and they
eſteemed it as a thing made on Purpoſe to mock them: And then they began to
queſtion the Protector's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, how his Highneſs came to place them in
the Houſe of Peers, at which the Commons were much diſguſted: Of which
the Protector being advertized, he was ſtrangely ſurprized, and found he
had been ſhort-ſighted, in not having proceeded at the ſame time, to fill
up his Houſe of Commons, when he erected his other of Peers. However, he
forthwith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened both Houſes, and reprehended the Houſe of Commons for
preſuming to queſtion his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: The other Houſe, he ſaid, were
Lords, and ſhould be Lords, and commanded them to enter upon ſuch
Buſineſs as might be for the Benefit, not Deſtruction of the
Commonwealth, which he would by God's Help prevent: But finding his
Animadverſions did not reform them, but that they continued their former
Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and knowing the Tickliſhneſs of his Time would not endure
Diſputes, eſpecially as to his Pageant Lords, whom he had newly erected: He
therefore ſent the Black Rod for the Houſe of Commons, the Fourth of
<hi>February,</hi> and after having uſed many ſharp Expreſſions of
Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he told them, it concerned his Intereſt as much as the Peace of
the Nation, to diſſolve them, and accordingly he did diſſolve them: And
to ſhew how little he feared thoſe Men <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0319800400:224"/> who
contradicted him at home, he ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for <hi>Lambert,</hi> and took
away his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and removed him from the Army, who forthwith retired,
and was as little taken notice of, as if he had never been in Authority; which
gave great Reputation to the Protector, and ſhewed he was Maſter of his
Army.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe warm Debates were in Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home, about
the Protector's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was ſo cunning as to make Treaties and
Leagues abroad, and was publickly owned by many Kingdoms and States; and it was
about this time, that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the
<hi>French,</hi> took <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Graveling</hi>; the firſt of
which was by by Agreement garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Sir
<hi>William Lockhart,</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> made Governour; and
<hi>Graveling</hi> was garriſoned by the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But during theſe Succeſſes abroad, the King was firſt at
<hi>Cologne,</hi> where he was well received and treated, before which, his
Family was in great Diſorder at <hi>Paris</hi>; but being at
<hi>Cologne,</hi> it was put under the Care and Management of Sir <hi>Stephen
Fox,</hi> who had the Diſpoſal of all, and he there kept the King's Houſe
and Family for about Six Hundred Piſtoles a Month; but his Majeſty never
kept a Coach all the time he was at <hi>Cologne.</hi> From thence his Majeſty
went to <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he ſtayed in the Year
1657; and after he had been there ſome time, Six Thouſand Guilders was
ſettled month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himſelf and Family; and Half that Sum (I mean Half as
much more) for Support of <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0319800400:225"/> the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Glouceſter.</hi> He was then to raiſe Four Regiments of Foot; the
firſt Regiment for his own Guards, commanded by the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi>;
but they were to do their Duty in the Army as common Men, till his Majeſty
was in Condition to bring them about his Perſon. The Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>
had the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Regiment, the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> the third, and the
fourth was given to the Earl of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobleman,
who had ſerved the King with great Fidelity: And theſe four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments were
ſoon raiſed. Whilſt the King was at <hi>Bruges, Cromwell</hi> exerciſed
all imaginary Tyranny in his Government: The King's Heart was almoſt broken
with the daily Informations he received, of the Ruine and Deſtruction his
loyal Party underwent, and the Butchery acted upon them, and the extreme
Tyranny <hi>Cromwell</hi> exerciſed over the whole Nation, was then very
grievous to his Majeſty, ſeeing no End of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> was then governed by a Rod of Iron, ſubdued by
thoſe whom they had firſt taught to rebel, and with whom they had joined to
deſtroy their own natural Prince, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Monarchy which had
been ever ſince they were a Nation; and thoſe who had uſed to practiſe
ſuch ill Behaviour towards their King, were then contemned, and made Slaves
to the meaneſt of the People, who preſcribed them new Laws to which they
had never been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed. The King then ſaw thoſe, who were the
Beginners and firſt Authors of our publick <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0319800400:226"/> Calamities,
ſo much Sharers therein, that they were no more Maſters of their own.
Eſtates, than they were whom they had firſt ſpoiled; and that no Part of
the new Government was in their Hands who had pulled down the old; and that
after Monarchy had ſeemed ſo odious to them, their whole Nation was at the
Diſpoſal of a ſingle Perſon; and that thoſe <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords,
without whoſe traitorous Aſſiſtance the Scepter could never have been
wreſted out of the Hands of their King, were now reckoned amongſt the
Dreggs of the People, and ſo numbred. This could not but give ſome
Satisfaction to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to ſee God's Judgments fallen upon
them, who were the principal Cauſe of our Rebellion in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I go farther, I will beg Leave here to give you
<hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Character, both before and after he came to be Protector.
At the firſt Beginning of the Long Parliament, when he heard any Man ſpeak
of the Troubles of the Nation, he would weep moſt bitterly, and appear the
moſt afflicted Perſon in the World, with the Senſe of the Calamities that
were likely to arrive: But the wiſer ſort of Men in the Houſe of Commons
ſoon diſcovered his wicked Intentions, and his great Hypocriſy was no
longer concealed from them. Nothing more perplexed him, than the Death of his
dear Daughter <hi>Claypole,</hi> who was troubled at nothing ſo much, before
her Death, as at the Blood her Father had ſpilt; and it was believed ſhe
had repreſented his worſt Actions to him, <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0319800400:227"/> and yet he
never made the leaſt Shew of any Remorſe or Repentance for any of his
Actions. He could never have done half that Miſchief he did, without having
great Parts of Induſtry, Courage, and Judgment. He muſt have had a
wonderful Inſight into the Affections and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Men, who from a private
Birth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Intereſt, Eſtate, or Alliance, could raiſe himſelf
to ſo great a Height: He attempted that which no good Man durſt undertake,
and performed that which none but a wicked vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Man could ſucceed in.
There was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never a more wicked Man, nor one that ever brought to
paſs what he deſigned more wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He conſulted very few, and when he
had once taken a Reſolution, he would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from it. He was
never unfortunate in any of his Undertakings abroad, but only in that of
<hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Venables,</hi> who were ſent out by him with a Fleet and
Land Army, in 1655, and had ill Succeſs. In fine, to reduce Three Nations,
who perfectly hated him, into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Obedience, and to govern them with a
Rod of Iron, by an Army that wiſhed his utter Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, was an Inſtance of a
prodigious Addreſs, and ſhewed, that he was born for the Ruine of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>But yet, after all his Greatneſs both at home and abroad, ſome
things happened before his End, which much diſturbed him; not only the
frequent Plots againſt his Perſon, but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up of a monſtrous
Whale in the freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, contrary to the Nature of that Fiſh, as 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0319800400:228"/> far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where it was taken, and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by many to portend ſome great Alteration in the Commonwealth: Yet
this did not ſo much trouble the Protector, as the Death of his dear Daughter
<hi>Claypole,</hi> who died in the Beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1658. He had
ſettled his greateſt Affection upon this Daughter, from the time of whoſe
Death he appeared very melancholy, and fell ſick about the Middle of
<hi>Auguſt</hi>; but his Sickneſs being only an Ague, there was no
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his Death; and he declared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to his Phyſicians,
and many others, <hi>That God would not take him away, till he done ſome more
Work for him.</hi> But it ſoon appeared, that if God did not, the Devil did
take him; for he died the Third of <hi>September</hi> following: A Day that had
been ſo fortunate to him proved his laſt in this World; and ſuch a
Tempeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Death that Night, as was not ſeen in the Memory of
Man: Great Trees in <hi>St. James</hi>'s Park were blown up by the Roots, of
which I was an Eye Witneſs. The large ſtrong Pales, which made up the
Breach on <hi>London</hi> Bridge (cauſed by a violent Fire ſome Years
before) were blown down; many Boats caſt away upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> great
Shipwrecks at Sea, beſides ſeveral by the Storm, in divers Parts of
<hi>England,</hi> by Land. The Prince of the Air ſhewed his Power was above
the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's, who thought not fit that he ſhould part quietly out of this
World, who had made ſuch a Combuſtion, Trouble, and Miſery in it. He was
a Perſon indeed, who, by his Arts of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0319800400:229"/>
Wickedneſs, and Murder, attained to the Height of Greatneſs: He made
foreign Nations know more of <hi>England</hi>'s Strength, than any of our Kings
of late Years had done. Beſides, he had all Parts of Policy ſo
neceſſary for an Uſurper, and had ſo perfectly learnt the Art of
Diſſembling, that, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven (whoſe Heart was far
from it) and his Hand laid on his Breaſt, he would pray, cry, and act the
Saint, till he had fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed his Deſigns.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Death, his Son <hi>Richard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
named in the Petition and Advice, ſucceeded as Protector; but having nothing
of his late Father's Spirit or Parts, was unfit to hold what his late Father
had got, and ſo was quickly turned out and depoſed by his ambitious and
jealous Kindred, without drawing his Sword for it. Then, at the Army's Call,
that filthy Part of the Commons called the Juncto, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back to govern;
who not pleaſing their over-powerful Maſters, the Army, they were a
ſecond time expulſed by the Army. Then a Creature of the Army's begetting
(with a new Name of their own deviſing) called, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of
Safety,</hi> was ſubſtituted, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a great Difference
betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, the latter declaring a
great Diſſatisfaction againſt the Proceedings of the former, and the
Conteſt ended by the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, their
Mutinery and Mouldring away, whilſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
Command of the prudent <hi>Fabius,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0319800400:230"/>
               <hi>Monk,</hi> advanced towards <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Coming and Deſign
had been prevented, if timorous <hi>Fleetwood</hi> had made good his Promiſe
of ſending firſt to the King, the Great Seal, with the Keeper of it, to
aſſure his Majeſty of their Repentance and Reſolution to call in the
King; which was agreed betwixt <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and the Keeper, who was ready
to go with the Great Seal: But ſome Officers, then in Being in the Army,
oppoſed <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s Reſolution, who had before promiſed them to
do nothing without their Conſent, of that Nature; and ſo the whole
Buſineſs was ſet aſide, when the Keeper was ready to go with the Great
Seal.</p>
            <p>It was the King's great Happineſs, that <hi>Monk</hi> never
owned his Deſign of ſerving the King, till it fell in his Power. If he had
declared his Reſolution ſooner, he had deſtroyed himſelf; and the
Aſſurance that the Parliament had, that <hi>Monk</hi> had no ſuch
Intention, hindered thoſe Obſtructions which probably would have ruined his
Credit with his own Army, and united the reſt of the Forces againſt him. It
is true, that he was the Inſtrument to bring that to paſs, which certainly
he had neither Wiſdom to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, nor Underſtanding to contrive, he
being a phlegmatick dull Perſon, till he was awakened by his Officers, who
thought him in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by pulling down the Gates of the City of
<hi>London:</hi> And therefore his Officers perſwaded him to march again into
the City, and then he declared to the Citizens (at Alderman <hi>Wate</hi>'s
Houſe) whom I knew very well, and at which <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0319800400:231"/> time I
lodged at Mr. <hi>Clargy</hi>'s Houſe, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary near
<hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> whoſe Siſter was married to <hi>Monk.</hi> This
Apothecary was a very active ſtirring Man, and full of Intrigues, and I
believe he prevailed much with his Brother <hi>Monk,</hi> to induce him to do
what he did: For, whilſt he was at Alderman <hi>Wate</hi>'s, he then
aſſured the Citizens, that he would live and die with them, which gave them
great Joy, and put the Parliament in ſome Diſorder; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent
ſome Members to treat with him, upon which he returned to <hi>Whitehall,</hi>
and then ſent for the Members of both Parties, for thoſe that were turned
out of Parliament in the Year 1648, and delivers a Paper to them in Writing,
which his Secretary read to them; and then they all thought, that he really
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Eſtabliſhing a Commonwealth: But no ſooner was the
Conference ended, but the Members that had been excluded from 1648, entered the
Houſe of Commons, and preſently diſſolved themſelves; which really
contributed as much to his Majeſty's Service, as if really <hi>Monk</hi> had
deſigned it at the firſt: But whether he did, or did not, I think is yet a
great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the wiſeſt amongſt us believing he never at firſt
intended it, but that it fell into his Lap, to make our Nation happy, by
reſtoring the right Heir to the Crown, without the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any
foreign Prince, which was a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs beyond our Expectation or
Deſert.</p>
            <p>But before the almoſt miraculous Reſtoration of King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. and his coming to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0319800400:232"/>
I think ſomething may be ſaid, tho' not in Vindication, yet in Mitigation,
of the Crimes committed by ſome Members in that Long Parliament, in which
unhappy Times the Crown was even laid in the Duſt, and the Juſtice of the
King's Cauſe did not prevail againſt thoſe malignant Spirits (who had
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the King's Ruine) and had miſled and corrupted the
Underſtandings of many of his Majeſty's Subjects, who were over-perſwaded
by the ſpecious Shew of <hi>Salus Populi ſuprema Lex,</hi> and thro'
Miſtakes and Inconveniences then introduced (tho' not intended by the late
King) did, in thoſe calamitous Times, rather weakly than wilfully,
tranſgreſs their Bounds of Duty, and did not pay the Reverence and
Obedience to the fundamental Laws of the Land, which they ſhould have done,
but were led by the wicked Inſinuation of others, being confident that many,
from their Hearts, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred every Article of that ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of
Rebellion, and moſt heartily depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Miſeries that followed it; and
yet they themſelves contributed to it, and to thoſe very Votes from whence
thoſe Evils they abhorred did naturally ſpring; not conſidering, that
when their Conſultations tended to leſſen or infringe the Power and
Dignity of their King, they meddled with that which was not in their
Determination, and which the King ought to have maintained with the Sacrifice
of his Life: And we may well believe, thoſe Miſeries could never have been
brought upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0319800400:233"/> nor that
Violence committed upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon of his then Majeſty, if
thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligated Villains that deſigned it, had not firſt violated the
Parliament, by forcibly excluding thoſe Members, who would never have
conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſo execrable an Attempt, ſince they had avowed and
covenanted for Defence and Safety of the King's Perſon, which was ever before
dear to Parliaments: And none can think of that horrid Act committed againſt
the precious Life of our Sovereign, but with Deteſtation, and ſuch
Abhorrence, that Words are wanting to expreſs it. And had I the Voice of
<hi>Stentor,</hi> nay, of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I could not ſufficiently
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt it; and next to wiſhing it had never been, we wiſh it
may never be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, but with that Grief and Trouble of Mind it
deſerves, being the greateſt Reproach to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation that
it ever yet incurred, tho' the Nation it ſelf, as well as ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament were innocent of it, which was the only Contrivance and Act of
ſome ambitious blood-thirſty Perſons, hoping the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice will
not impute the Evil of it to the whole Kingdom, and involve the Guiltleſs
with the Guilty.</p>

to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Tears of Blood than Ink, or rather to have a Veil drawn over
it, that it may never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, to the eternal Shame of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, his Son, King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was crowned King
in <hi>Scotland</hi>; but it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch hard Terms, that it was a
Queſtion, <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0319800400:236"/> whether the Crown was worth accepting.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as the King's Affairs then ſtood, it was judged beſt to accept of
it, preferring the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Title of a King in his own Dominions, to the empty
Title of a King in another Nation. And yet it was thought ſtrange, that the
King would put himſelf into the Hands of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe Army had
treated his royal Father ſo perfidiouſly; the Selling and Delivering him to
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> being the moſt barbarous Action that any
People were ever guilty of; and their Honour can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired for the
Horridneſs of that moſt wicked Crime. However, the late King
<hi>Charles</hi> could not be much blamed, in the ſad Poſture of his
Affairs, for going to that Army, to which he was ſo kindly invited, having
been ever a great Lover of that Nation, not only having been born there, but
educated by them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought he ſhould find there his greateſt
Security, where he found the moſt Danger. But indeed ſuch ſtrange
Circumſtances contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his Ruine, that we might think Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and
Earth had conſpired againſt him, who was from the Beginning ſo much
betrayed by his own Servants, that very few remained faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him; and yet
their Treachery proceeded rather from ſome particular Animoſities amongſt
themſelves, than from any treaſonable Intent to do the King Harm: And
notwithſtanding he was reduced to ſo miſerable a Fate, yet it is moſt
certain he had as great a Share in the Hearts and Affections of his Subjects in
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0319800400:237"/> and was as much beloved and eſteemed by
them, as any of his Predeceſſors: But it was our Wantonneſs under the
Happineſs we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed beyond any other Nation, and our own Sins, which
brought that Judgment upon us. The ſtrange Tranſactions in
<hi>England,</hi> which began in the Year 1641, are not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled for
the wonderful Paſſages therein; we then ſaw <hi>England,</hi> in the
higheſt Pitch of worldly Happineſs, fall to the loweſt Degree of
Misfortune and Miſery.</p>
               <p>I know very well, how unſearchable the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Princes
are, in what an Abyſs they lye, and how much too deep to be ſounded by our
Diſcourſes; but when I remember the Turns of thoſe Times, I ſeem rather
to dream, than to think the Relation true, of ſo many ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Revolutions, which are ſcarce credible in this our Age. The beſt of Kings
was then condemned by mercileſs Rebels, after being abandoned by his
neareſt Friends, and purſued by his fierceſt Enemies, who furiouſly
ſeized upon his ſacred Perſon, and at laſt took away his Life, and
triumphed in their own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with ſucceſsful Inſolence for ſome
Years, when, at laſt, by God's Providence, the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir to the Crown
was brought home to his own People, without the Aſſiſtance of any foreign
Prince, in as full Exerciſe of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as any of his
Predeceſſors ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and by many of the ſame Men, who had before
been very active in the Miſeries of the Kingdom, and Deſtruction of their
own <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0319800400:238"/> Country; and yet the Sufferings of the royal Family
were all recovered, by the concurring Hand of divine Providence. By which we
may ſee, when Subjects make Victories over their Princes, they are Triumphs
over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and thoſe Men which will force Laws which they are bound
to preſerve, will, in the End, find all their Victories full of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
bringing Ruine to their Authors.</p>
               <p>But, leaving this Digreſſion, let us ſee what is become of
our King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried many eminent faithful Subjects with
him thither, who were nothing at all eſteemed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who
choſe a particular Council, by whoſe Advice the King was to govern, who
gave the <hi>Scots</hi> great Satisfaction in all things they deſired of him:
And, upon his being crowned in <hi>Scotland, Cromwell</hi> was declared
General, and prepared for a War, and marched with his Army, which he had before
modelled to his own Mind, commanded abſolutely, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing and
ſuppreſſing all who had been ſupported by General <hi>Fairfax.</hi> The
Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants had all the Credit about <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the Pulpits were
open to all that would ſhew their Gifts, and great Diſtraction and
Confuſion in Religion then governed. The <hi>Scots</hi> raiſed an Army
againſt <hi>Cromwell,</hi> ſupplied with all things neceſſary, but
Prudence, Courage, and Conduct. The King deſired that he might command the
Army, ſince he was to run the Fortune of it; but the <hi>Scots</hi> would
ſcarce give him Leave to ſee it. <hi>Cromwell</hi> enters <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0319800400:239"/> as far as <hi>Dunbar,</hi> but was ſoon reduced to
great Diſtreſs, for want of all Neceſſaries. The <hi>Scots</hi> really
believed they had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at their Mercy; and it is certain, if
the <hi>Scots</hi> had only kept their Trenches, and ſent Parties of Horſe
after the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they would have marched off, and left their
Cannon and heavy Baggage behind: But <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeeing the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Army decamp, and follow him, he then made a Stand with his
Army, and the <hi>Scots</hi> ſoon found they were not upon ſo clear a
Chaſe as they imagined, being ſo clearly defeated by <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
that he was that Night, being the Third of <hi>September,</hi> Maſter both of
<hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The <hi>Scots,</hi> like the
Anabaptiſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> pretended at firſt nothing but Faith and
true Fear of God, and declared againſt Riches and Honours as Vanity; and upon
the great Opinion of their Humility and Devotion, they had procured much
Eſteem; and after they had enſnared many with their Hypocriſy, they would
reform both Church and State: And having gotten Power, and enriched
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Spoils of <hi>England,</hi> they thought then to
juſtify themſelves by our Saviour's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that <hi>The Meek ſhould
inherit the Earth.</hi> When they firſt entered <hi>England,</hi> their
Succeſs crowned their Work, and they were thought a wiſe and reſolute
Nation; for, after an unbloody War, for above one Year, they returned laden
with Spoils and great Riches, and were liberally rewarded, as well for going
out, as coining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0319800400:240"/>It ſeems the King, in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
was ſo far from being in their late Battle at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> that he was
not admitted into their Councils or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: But to redeem their former Error,
they reſolved to raiſe a new Army, to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the King in
Perſon, hoping to paſs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way bye <hi>Cromwell</hi> into
<hi>England,</hi> intending to make the Seat of the War there, and made the
higheſt Profeſſions of Duty to his Majeſty, that could be invented, and
gave great Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the King, of what Demonſtrations of Zeal and Duty
they would ſuddenly ſhew him.</p>
               <p>The King began his March, which was long and terrible, and
ſeveral Engagements paſſed in the Way, with different Succeſs, but
moſt of them to the King's Diſadvantage, who, in the End, arrived at
<hi>Worceſter</hi> with his ſhattered Army, and was there as clearly
defeated by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Third of <hi>September,</hi> as the
<hi>Scots</hi> were the Year before at <hi>Dunbar.</hi> The King's Eſcape,
after the Loſs of this Battle, was very miraculous, being preſerved by a
wonderful Providence from the Fury of his blood-thirſty Rebels. His Majeſty
firſt met in a Wood, not far from <hi>Boſcobell,</hi> with Captain
<hi>Careleſs,</hi> who perſwaded the King to get up into an Oaken Tree:
From thence he went into a Cottage, where he lay in a Barn, and was then
condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to another Houſe by Father <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> who was ſent
to him by <hi>Careleſs,</hi> who after brought him to the Lord
<hi>Wilmot,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the King to Mr. <hi>Lane</hi>'s Houſe; from
whence the King rode before young Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> 
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0319800400:241"/> to
her Couſin <hi>Norton</hi> near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where the King was known
to the Butler. From thence the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> took the King into
<hi>Suſſex,</hi> to Collonel <hi>Gunter</hi>'s, and from thence brought the
King into <hi>Normandy,</hi> who had ever after a great Eſteem for his
Lordſhip. There was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch a Concurrence of Charity, good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and
Generoſity, in Perſons of the meaneſt Extraction, and hardeſt Fortune,
who knew the Delivery of the King would have been of great Advantage to them,
that we may look upon the King's Eſcape as conducted by Hands of the
Almighty, who covered him as with a Shield, when his rebellious People ſought
his Life, who was ſtill concealed from their moſt diligent Search, wherein
Father <hi>Huddleſton</hi> was very inſtrumental: And tho' many knew where
the King was, and thoſe very poor, yet none were tempted by great Rewards,
and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Fears, to betray the King, who after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Changes of
Station, and Misfortunes, after this miraculous Manner, was brought into
<hi>France,</hi> and at laſt brought home to his own People: And tho' he was
forced away by a Whirlwind of Rebellion, he was reſtored to his Three
Kingdoms with the ſtill Voice of Peace and Mercy; a happy Preſage how his
Majeſty would govern, whoſe Reign, at leaſt the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it,
ſhewed ſufficiently his meek and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Temper. In the time of the
King's Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, he ſpent two Years at <hi>Cologne,</hi> where he was
well received by a Widow, at whoſe Houſe he lodged. Before his going to
<hi>Cologne,</hi> 
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0319800400:242"/> his Family was in great Diſorder;
but at his being there, by Direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, his
Family was put under the Care and Management of Sir <hi>Stephen Fox,</hi> who
kept it in excellent Order. The King was then of a very merciful Nature, and at
that time it was very agreeable to his Inclination, not to have the Penal Laws
put in Execution; and tho' it was not in his Power to repeal them, yet it was
never in his Will to execute them; and his Majeſty was then very forward to
do all he could for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in that kind: But when he
came into <hi>England,</hi> he ſoon changed his Mind, and proved in the End
very ſevere againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to live
quietly, but could not be allowed to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Upon this King's moſt happy Reſtoration, there was ſeen
from all Parts his loyal Subjects contending how to expreſs their Gratitude
to Heaven, for its glorious Favour, and the King's no leſs than miraculous
Return, and for the manifold Bleſſings they were like to enjoy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
benign Reign of ſo excellent a Prince, every Man ſtriving who ſhould
firſt pay the humble Oblation of their Duties, which really proceeded from
Hearts full of Reverence and Obedience to his ſacred Perſon; being
poſſeſſed with a deep Senſe of the Honour and good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they had
to be born his Subjects: And, indeed, who could forbear to be tranſported
with Joy, that was going to receive his King? And who could contain the
Overflowings of his <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0319800400:243"/> Heart, when he could ſay, <hi>I
have my KING again?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, that when the Nation had been ſo long mad, after
ſo many Changes and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and our Progreſs from bad to worſe, we
might with Reaſon have expected, God ſhould have ſent us the worſt of
Tyrants, ſome Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del or Uſurper, to ſcourge us with Whips, as we well
deſerved: But he was ſo gracious as to ſend us our own King, the
undoubted Heir to the Crown, to redeem our Nation from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy it had
undergone, and to reſtore it to all it had loſt, and to make the People as
happy as they ought to be. In order to which, the King gave a general Pardon to
all (excepting only ſuch as ſhould be excepted by Parliament) and that no
Perſon whatſoever, for any Crime committed, either againſt his late royal
Father, or againſt the preſent King's ſacred Perſon, ſhould ever be
brought in Queſtion, to the leaſt Damage of Life, Liberty, or Eſtate, or
even to the Prejudice of his Reputation, or any other Reproach or Term of
Diſtinction: And the King did then alſo declare a Liberty to tender
Conſciences, and that none ſhould be diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or called in Queſtion
for Difference of Opinion in Matters of Religion, which did not diſturb the
Peace or Settlement of the Kingdom. And further, to let his Subjects ſee how
to practiſe the Art of Forgetfulneſs, which they ſhould learn from him,
his Majeſty did then put ſome Men into eminent Employs, who had before
diſſerved him; ſo that every Man might <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0319800400:244"/> capacitate
himſelf, by his future Behaviour, for any Place. But this Conduct ſeemed to
ſome like a trimming Indifferency, to diſoblige his old Friends, in hopes
of getting new ones, which hath uſually been the Subverſion of
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; and no wiſe Counſellour would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe his Prince to grieve
his old Friends, to make his old Enemies rejoice. However, as the Poſture of
the King's Affairs then ſtood, he was obliged to take ſuch Meaſures; but
whether, at laſt, the King found his End in them, is yet a great Queſtion.
For, as the Judgments of God, have, in all Ages, reached thoſe at laſt, who
have ſecretly taken away the Lives of Princes, or have been in open
Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt their lawful Kings, ſo his Juſtice did at laſt, in
<hi>England,</hi> become the Revenger of Blood, and purſued thoſe that
killed and took Poſſeſſion, after they had boaſted of their
Wickedneſs for ſeveral Years, and brought them at laſt to condign
Puniſhment, to let the World ſee and know, that Rebellion is criminal, even
when it is proſperous; and tho' God may forbear for ſome time to puniſh,
yet he always does it juſtly at laſt: For tho' God hath leaden Feet, and is
ſlow in puniſhing, yet he hath Iron Hands, and ſtrikes home in the End:
And here, that ſome Compenſation might be made for the Loſs of the Royal
Father, which was irreparable, God gave the Crown to his eldeſt Son. It is
moſt certain, that King <hi>Charles</hi> II. at his firſt coming to the
Throne, had moſt reconciling Thoughts, who gave large Evidence of them, 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0319800400:245"/> after ſo high a Diſtemper, and ſuch a univerſal
ſhaking the Foundations of Government, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and commanding his
Parliament to take Care to repair the Breaches, and to uſe ſuch
Circumſpection and Induſtry, as might provide things neceſſary for
ſtrengthening thoſe Repairs, and to prevent for the future whatever might
diſturb or weaken the common Intereſt; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to his Parliament a
general Union, as the beſt, if not the only Way for their own Security, and
the Happineſs of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This King, indeed, at his Reſtoration,
was glorious in the Eyes of all his Subjects: Thoſe great Deliverances which
the divine Goodneſs had afforded to his royal Perſon from many imminent
Dangers, and the Support which it gave to his heroick princely Mind, under
ſuch various Tryals, made it appear, that he was precious in God's Sight, and
as Gold out of the Fire: He was reſtored to his People and Patrimony with
more Splendor and Dignity, who had made a right Uſe of his Afflictions, and
taken ſuch Obſervations of other Countries, that he really intended to make
all his Subjects the better for what he had ſeen and ſuffered abroad.</p>
               <p>It is true, that, in the Beginning of this King's Reign, the
Doctrine of the Court was, <hi>Sow a little, that ye may reap much</hi>; and
thoſe who were then entruſted with the Nation's Purſe, were themſelves
for diving into the Prince's Pocket; and that too generous Prince, at his
firſt coming to the Crown, was ſoon over-perſwaded <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0319800400:246"/>
to give away the greateſt Part of his Crown Lands. The Courtier begged, and
the Citizen bought, and the King was ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all; and yet they
who ſuffered for his late royal Father, were not the better for all his
immoderate Bounties. Theſe his great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralities were not given as the
Recompence of ancient Merit, but were beſtowed either as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Vice, or
Price of Treachery; ſo that the worſt Men made the beſt Advantage: And
tho' the King did then what was very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Crown; yet ſuch was
the flouriſhing Condition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at that time, that the
People could bear a great deal of ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Beſides, ſome were glad
to ſee a young King that would ſoon be neceſſitated by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Bounty to depend upon his People, who did then begin to apprehend, that the
King did meditate an arbitrary Power. Now, whatever Ground the great
Counſellours of thoſe Times had, there was no Bar put in the Way of that
deſtructive Bounty; but as ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Goods ſeldom proſper, very little
of what was obtained remained long in the Hands of the firſt
Poſſeſſor, but all was ſoon diſperſed into a Multitude of Hands,
and the Silence of thoſe who then had a Right to complain, ſeemed in ſome
meaſure to have juſtified ſuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And tho' the King, being
then young, airy and liberal, was much to blame for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch a Spoil
to be made of his Revenue; yet they (whoſe Duty it was to take Care of the
Body Politick) ſuffered the Diſtemper to <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0319800400:247"/> proceed too
far; and what the King did was then winked at, becauſe the Courtiers (who
were neareſt the King's Perſon) got all, and and the great Trade and Wealth
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might bear ſuch Gifts, which were not then
ſupplied by new and heavy Taxes, which the People after found exceſſive
in a following Reign. However, this great Overſight of the King ſhould
teach wiſe Princes to diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe that ſerve them for
their own Ends, and thoſe that have only in their View the Intereſt and
Honour of the King their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: But we always ſee Compliance and
Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry get the better of Honeſty and plain Dealing, Princes uſually
loving thoſe beſt that diſpute not with them, and prefer them before
ſuch as adviſe them really what is beſt for their Service. This kind of
Flattery is a Plant ſo preſerved in moſt Courts, that it never fails of
bringing moſt dangerous Fruit, and Princes very ſeldom diſcover it, till
it be too late, and that they are ruined by it. I muſt confeſs, it would be
a great Advantage to Princes, and to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects a great Happineſs, to
have plain Truths delivered to them with Decency and Privacy, from their moſt
faithful Servants, whereby they might redreſs many Miſtakes of their
Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Will; which brings to my Mind what <hi>Tom Killigrew,</hi> a
Groom of the Bed-Chamber to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. ſaid, as he was under
his Barber's Hands: A Book being in the Window, in which <hi>Killigrew</hi> was
looking, it being a Book of his own Plays, of which the King taking 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0319800400:248"/> Notice, he aſked him, <hi>What Account he would give
at the Day of Judgment, of all the idle Words in that Book? Why truly,</hi>
ſays <hi>Killigrew, I ſhall give a better Account of all the idle Words in
this Book, than your Majeſty ſhall do of all your idle Promiſes, and more
idle Patents, which have undone many; but my idle Words in this Book have
undone no Perſon.</hi> This was a bold and ſharp Repartee; but the King
being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Maſter, and not of a Diſpoſition to do harſh
things, gave <hi>Killigrew</hi> a great Liberty of Fooling; for otherwiſe he
muſt needs have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notice of that bitter Reflection, which the King did
not: But if the Subſtance of that Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſm had been told the King decently
and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, it might have had a good Operation; whereas what was ſpoken
was then taken for a Jeſt only, and ſo the King paſſed it by. Now if we
ſeriouſly reflect on the firſt Twelve Years of this King's Government, we
ſhall not find in the like Space of Time, either at home or abroad, ſo
great Plenty of all things for the Delight of Mankind, nor find ſo long a
Time free from Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, where the King and Lords did
leſs oppreſs the Commons, and where there was ſo great a
Condeſcenſion to tender Conſciences: And if it be true, that as <hi>Multa
funera ſunt opprobria Medicorum,</hi> ſo <hi>Multa ſupplicia ſunt
opprobria Principum</hi>; it muſt be much for the Honour and Memory of this
King, that in his firſt Twelve Years Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there was not one Nobleman
put to Death, and ſo few of all others at the Aſſizes, 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0319800400:249"/> that the like was never known in the Memory of Man; and
yet impartial Juſtice was executed every where. I heartily wiſh I could
have ſaid the ſame to this King's Death, for then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he would
have been <hi>CHARLES the Good,</hi> tho' not <hi>CHARLES the Great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas! there now began to be a great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude of good
and bad Events, and a very unſettled and various Management of publick
Affairs, and not with ſuch a Steadineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as the freſh
Experience of our then late Misfortunes might have inſtructed thoſe with
Courage and Conſtancy that were entruſted with them: But thoſe
Miniſters that then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King at the Helm of his Government, were
much to blame to ſuffer ſuch things, which were quickly reduced to a moſt
unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, betwixt the King and his ill-natured obſtinate Subjects
then aſſembled in Parliament, that by his Majeſty's condeſcending to
ſome things, which ſeemed of little or no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence when firſt
yielded unto, yet they were afterwards made the Foundation of a great Battery
againſt the King's Authority, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Strength of his Government:
But it was our own Ingratitude under ſo many great Advantages we then enjoyed
beyond other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which drew thoſe Judgments from Heaven upon us. I
confeſs, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks who were peaceable and innocent,
ſuffered at this time many grievous Perſecutions, which were not only
permitted by the King, but his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was encouraged therein, tho' the
King <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0319800400:250"/> was not ignorant of their Innocence: Yet, to
Perſons that knew thoſe Times, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the King was teazed by
thoſe ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, it will be the leſs
Wonder, that ſuch things ſhould happen in the Days of ſuch a Prince, who
had ſo yielding a Nature as the King. 'Tis true, the great Perſecutions
which the Chriſtians ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under the good Reign of <hi>Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, were all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, how
juſtly I cannot ſay; but our King did not only connive, but would often
rally at the Extravagance of the Houſe of Commons: And yet this I may truly
ſay, that tho' he gave unlawful Permiſſion to perſecute the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, whom he knew to be innocent; yet he always ſtood
firm to keep the Succeſſion of his Crown in its due and lawful Deſcent,
and would never yield to have it alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, tho' he was preſſed very
violently to it, by great Artifices, which made him often prorogue Parliaments,
and the King continued reſolute in this Point, even to his Death.</p>
               <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1672, Mr. <hi>Borell</hi> the <hi>Holland</hi>
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, was with his Majeſty, and deſired the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of four
Deputies from the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to know what the King deſired, and ſaid
as many were appointed for <hi>France</hi>; but the King refuſed their
Admiſſion, and ſaid, he would do nothing without the Participation of his
Allies: However, he would be ſo generous as to do what he could that lay in
his Power, and then named the Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> his Envoy 
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0319800400:251"/> Extraordinary to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and would
ſend him to confer with that King upon their Propoſals, and it was ſaid
he ſhould go thro' <hi>Holland,</hi> and take Sir <hi>Gabriel Sylvius</hi>
with him.</p>
               <p>The Sixteenth of <hi>January</hi> following, the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> had the ſame Cenſure from the Houſe of Commons as the
Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> had, to be both baniſhed from the King's
Preſence for ever: Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> deſired to be
heard in the Houſe of Commons, which was granted to him, and his Buſineſs
was to lay all the Blame upon the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> who alſo
anſwered in the Houſe, and behaved himſelf ſo well, that he got
immortal Reputation, to be a Man of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Prudence, Conduct, and of great
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſo eſcaped the Cenſure of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Marquis de Freſno,</hi>
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Extraordinary from <hi>Spain,</hi> preſented to the King a
very warm Memorial, menacing a War, unleſs the King would embrace a Peace
with <hi>Holland,</hi> upon theſe Three Points. The Firſt was, The Flag to
Content, with Eight Hundred Thouſand Pattacoons, and the mutual Reſtitution
of Places and Prizes taken in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> To which his Majeſty returned
this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Anſwer.</p>
               <p>That, if they would add a Promiſe to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the <hi>Eaſt
India</hi> Trade, give Liberty of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at
<hi>Surinam,</hi> and not to Fiſh on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt without
Permiſſion; as to his Majeſty, he would be content: But 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0319800400:252"/> that the Place of Treaty muſt be <hi>Cologne,</hi> and
Reſpect paid to the Mediation of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which could not be avoided,
becauſe it was accepted by all: But becauſe his Majeſty's Anſwer to the
ſaid Memorial may be fully ſeen, I ſhall here repeat it, which was ſent
to me by the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> then Secretary of State.</p>

thereunto.</p>
                           <p>THAT he was not a little ſurprized to find the
Contents of this Paper confirmed to him the Report of a Treaty made betwixt the
King his Maſter and the <hi>States General of the United Provinces,</hi> the
Aſſiſting of whom in this War was a manifeſt Breach of the ſeparate
Article in the Treaty betwixt the two Kings, binding them reciprocally; not to
aſſiſt each other's Enemies in any open War: And his Majeſty's Wonder
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hath been the greater, that the Treaty with the <hi>States

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0319800400:256"/>Upon this Memorial, many Members of
Parliament had the States Generals Reply to his Majeſty's Anſwer to the
Memorial, ſent incloſed to them in Print, before the King had received the
Original. Sir <hi>William Coventry</hi> had four Copies ſent him in ſeveral
Pacquets, which he forthwith carried to the Lord Keeper, and his Lordſhip to
the King; by which may be ſeen what incongruous things the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſuffered, who endeavoured to dethrone his Majeſty, by their Appeal to his
People, without taking Notice of the King. The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this Reply of the
States General was ſent to his Excellency the <hi>Marquis de Freſno,</hi>
who thought it too ſcandalous for him to offer, and ſent it back to the
States with great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation: But towards the End of <hi>January,</hi> his
Excellency preſented a Letter from the States General to the King, wherein
they granted Five of the Six Points in a full Manner, but they refuſed any
Acknowledgment for the Fiſhing. The Ninth of <hi>February</hi> following, the
Peace betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> was Signed and Sealed by
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, as Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary for
<hi>Holland,</hi> and by ſix Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours on the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Side, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord Keeper, the Lord High Treaſurer, Duke of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> with the two principal Secretaries
of State. The Scope of the Peace was as follows.</p>
               <p>The Treaty of <hi>Bredah</hi> remains firm, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Treaty
confirmed for Nine Months, and that Commiſſioners ſhould preſently meet
to <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0319800400:257"/> regulate the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade, in which
Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>Spain</hi> to be left the Umpire, as it is the Guaranty of the
whole Treaty; <hi>New-York</hi> to be reſtored; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to
come from <hi>Surinam</hi>; Eight Hundred Thouſand Pattacoons to be paid in
the Time ſpecified; the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships to ſtrike in the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, from Cape <hi>Feneſtre</hi> to the <hi>Naze</hi> in
<hi>Norway:</hi> An Article for hindering each from ſuccouring the Enemies of
the other; but no mention is made of the Fiſhing, that remaining in the
ſame Condition it formerly was. <hi>France</hi> ſeemed much diſpleaſed
at this Peace; but it was believed his Majeſty of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would
interpoſe as Mediator, which was not what moſt <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>
deſired, who would gladly ſee <hi>France</hi> reduced to the Treaty
<hi>Pyrrhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean.</hi> The Peace betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>
being thus ſettled, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador took Leave of his
Majeſty, and embarked on the <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> Frigat, commanded by
Sir <hi>Richard Munden,</hi> and <hi>Don Emanuel de Lyra</hi> was named Envoy
in the Ambaſſador's Place; and I think it a Right owing to my Lord
<hi>Arlington,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert here a true Tranſlation of the Letter which
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador wrote from <hi>St. Andrè</hi> in

               <p>But before I go farther, I will give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how I came to
theſe honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on this Side the Sea.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed then to know, that, at the Lord
<hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Death, which happened a little before the Burning of
<hi>London,</hi> I was, by the King's Command ſignified to me by the Lord
<hi>Arlington,</hi> Principal Secretary of State, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to take Care of
his Funeral, and the Manner of it was then preſcribed me. His 
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0319800400:259"/> Lordſhip was a Privy-Counſellour, Collonel of the
Firſt Regiment of Foot Guards, and was before Major General of all the
Horſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and General of the Horſe in the Weſt of
<hi>England,</hi> and, at his Death, was Gentleman of his Majeſty's
Bed-chamber. When I had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Body in State, as the King commanded, to
<hi>Teddington</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> to be buried with his
Anceſtors, and that I returned to <hi>London,</hi> the Bills of the Charges
of the Funeral were brought to me, which I gave the Lord <hi>Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>;
but Money being then very rare, and the King no very good Paymaſter, the
Merchants expected their Money from me; and the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> having
received ſome Money from me, which was due to ſome Companies of the
Regiment, the Captains thereof complaining that their Companies were not paid,
the Matter was left to be adjuſted by the Duke of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle,</hi> who
was General. The Merchants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very importunate for their Money, I thought
beſt to retire, and came to <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where many
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers coming daily, I was ſoon diſcovered, and taken
Priſoner, and at firſt was uſed very hardly by the Jayler, who had Orders
to keep me in his own Apartments, to eat and drink with him, and that I
ſhould have Ten Shillings <hi>Engliſh</hi> daily allowed me, for Diet,
Lodging, and all Neceſſaries, which ſhould be paid before I was
releaſed; and Sir <hi>Mark d'Ogniati</hi> (who was of <hi>Bruges</hi>) and at
that time Reſident for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> engaged
to ſee all punctually paid. <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0319800400:260"/> When my Circumſtances
were better known, I was uſed very well; and it being then that the King of
<hi>France</hi> began his Pretenſions upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> in Right of the
<hi>Dauphin,</hi> and many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers being then in
<hi>Bruges,</hi> I had every Day much Company, and knew all that paſſed in
the Army, of which I gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count each Poſt to the Earl of
<hi>Arlington,</hi> who being then Principal Secretary of State, ſhewed my
Letters to the King, who being pleaſed with them, aſked the Lord
<hi>Arlington,</hi> who ſent thoſe Letters? who thereupon told his
Majeſty, that he had them from me, who was then a Priſoner in
<hi>Bruges:</hi> Whereupon the King preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he had ſeen
no Letters that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo much, and that gave ſo clear Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts;
and that if I could give ſuch Accounts in Priſon, I ſhould give much
better when out: And therefore the King bid his Lordſhip take Care, that I
ſhould be forthwith releaſed, and ſent over to him; tho' his Majeſty
knew I was at that time reconciled, and made a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, by
Father <hi>John Croſs,</hi> who was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at <hi>Douay,</hi> and at
that time Confeſſor to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nuns in the Prince's Hoffe at
<hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> Upon this Intimation from the King, Sir <hi>Mark
d'Ogniati</hi> was deſired by the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> to write to
<hi>Bruges,</hi> what the Account came to for my Impriſonment, and all
Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that all ſhould be ſuddenly paid; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the
Jayler came to tell me the good News: But I told him I was very well where I
was, and being out of Danger, that I had a <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0319800400:261"/> very good
Allowance, and could no where live ſo well, and that I would not ſtir from
Priſon, unleſs, after paying all the Charges, I might have Money to put me
in Equipage, and then I would willingly and faithfully ſerve the King: That
from my Scituation in Priſon I could ſee the Vanity and Hurry of the World,
where mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Men were daily diſtracting themſelves in weariſom
contentious Wars, about the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an empty World; and I could look
ſafely upon them, never intermeddling with the Actions of others, but ſpend
my Thoughts in my own little Sphere, and lay down my Head in Peace, and ſleep
ſecurely in the Boſom of Providence. Within few Days after I had given this
Account, Money was ſent to pay all the Charges of the Priſon, with One
Hundred Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> to put me in good Equipage; the Return of
Money being then very high, and much to my Advantage, I received what Was
ordered, and was forthwith releaſed from Priſon.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as I was at Liberty, I went to the Earl of
<hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> and knowing he had a great Influence upon <hi>Don Pedro
de Ronquillos,</hi> who was Super-Intedant at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> I
deſired he would ſpeak to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in my Behalf, that I might be
Auditor to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiment of Foot; which Place was then vacant,
and the Regiment was National, commanded by Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Scot</hi> of
<hi>Tekelah,</hi> Kinſman to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> Hereupon his
Lordſhip recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who was pleaſed to 
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0319800400:262"/> examine me, and finding me fit for the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gave
me his Certificate to the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who was then
Governour of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands,</hi> in Place of <hi>Marquis
Caſtle Roderigo:</hi> But the Plague being then at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the
Conſtable ſtayed at <hi>Malines,</hi> and, upon pretending much
Indiſpoſition of Health, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he might return into <hi>Spain.</hi>
However, he ſent the <hi>Marquis de Velaſco</hi> to compliment our King
upon his coming to the Government, who ſent Sir <hi>Edward-Spraig</hi> to
return his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Queen ſent Mr. <hi>Roper</hi> on her Part. So
ſoon as the Plague ceaſed at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the Conſtable
returned thither, where I found a Way to ſpeak to him, and gave him <hi>Don
Pedro</hi>'s Certificate, with a <hi>Placet</hi> from my ſelf, and had his
Excellency's Promiſe of Diſpatch, which he performed the next Day, to the
great Admiration of all the <hi>Commis</hi> in the Secretary's Office, that I
being a Stranger could get my Buſineſs ſo ſoon done, when many General
Officers of the Army had been waiting ſome Months without Diſpatch. Thus I
preſently got the Auditor's Place, and had the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble's Patent for it;
and when the Conſtable, upon his own importunate Deſire, returned for
<hi>Spain,</hi> I was then garriſoned in the <hi>Fauxburgs</hi> of
<hi>Ghent,</hi> and we had Orders not to beat any Drums, or to make the leaſt
Noiſe whilſt the Conſtable paſſed in his Barque.</p>
               <p>Upon the Conſtable's going for <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Count
de Monterrey,</hi> who was <hi>Maſter de Camp</hi> of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Regiment, was made Governour <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0319800400:263"/> 
                  <hi>pro Interim,</hi> and
was after confirmed Governour General of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi>
where he continued ſix Years, and was the beſt Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I ever ſaw in
them. He paid the Soldiers Ten Months in the Year, kept the Country in very
good Order, ſo that there was no Fear of Robbery; but it coſt the Lives of
many Men, and I have ſeen Fifteen or Sixteen hanging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the
Canal, betwixt <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Willibrook,</hi> for Robberies
committed there.</p>
               <p>Not long after Count <hi>Monterrey</hi>'s coming to the
Government of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Congreſs was appointed at
<hi>Cologne.</hi> The Plenipotentiaries for our King were Sir <hi>Leoline
Jenkins,</hi> Judge of our Admiralty, and Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi>
from both which I received Letters to go to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to buy ſome
Horſes and Coaches for them; and I was particularly recommended by them to
Monſieur <hi>Marine,</hi> Firſt Eſquire to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
to take his Opinion and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Choice of them. I was to buy two Setts
of Eight Horſes for each Coach, and the Coaches likewiſe, if I could get
them good and cheap: After which I was deſired to meet them at
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> in their Way to the Congreſs, which I did according to
their Directions. At their coming to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> they ſent me to find
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and Sir <hi>William Lockart,</hi> who were then
with the King of <hi>France,</hi> at a Houſe belonging to the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> Three Miles from <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> I there found the
aforenamed Perſons with the King, who was then marching to beſiege
<hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> 
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0319800400:264"/> The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was
made a Lieutenant General in the King's Army, and Sir <hi>William Lockhart</hi>
was our King's Ambaſſador with the <hi>French</hi> King. At my Return to
the Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries, I waited upon them to <hi>Cologne,</hi> and after came
back to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſeveral times by their
Excellencies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> upon great
Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and was ordered by them to hold a ſtrict Correſpondence with
Mr. <hi>Neipho,</hi> who lived then at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and was ordered to
ſerve our Plenipotentiaries in all he could.</p>
               <p>At this time I found the Count <hi>Monterrey</hi> was no Friend
to our Plenipotentiaries, nor indeed to our Maſter, or his Intereſt, in any
Caſe, and was particularly a great Friend to the Capers at <hi>Oſtend,</hi>
which Neſt of Pyrates did much Hurt to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants,
ſeizing all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ships they could find trading with
<hi>France,</hi> tho' their Trade was freely allowed by the Treaty of 1667,
ſolemnly ratified by both Crowns: But the Count <hi>Monterrey</hi> would not
allow that Treaty, becauſe he ſaid it was never publiſhed in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> which was their own Fault, for the Ratification, not the
Publication, makes all Treaties effectual: And yet our King bore all theſe
Affronts with incredible Patience, expecting that the Count <hi>Monterrey</hi>
would bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform himſelf, both of the Matters of Fact, and of the Law;
for certainly the Articles of that Treaty were ſo plain and clear in the
Point, that the Caſe was adjudged, as ſoon as compared with the Terms of
the Treaty; and the King <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0319800400:265"/> was ſtill in Hopes, that the
Count would be made ſenſible of the unſufferable Affront, as well as the
Injuſtice of ſuch Proceeding of the Privateers was to his Majeſty, even
to ſuch a Degree, that his Majeſty was thinking of another Way to right his
Subjects, if ſudden Reparation came not by fair Means.</p>
               <p>Neither was the Count <hi>Monterrey</hi> only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory in
this, but was highly diſpleaſed at my being employed by the
Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Cologne,</hi> and told Father <hi>Patrick</hi> (who
was then called Abbot of <hi>Thuly</hi>) that there was a little
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> (whoſe Name he knew not) that was employed by the
Ambaſſadors at <hi>Cologne,</hi> of which Father <hi>Patrick</hi> gave me
Notice, and ſaid, that, by the Deſcription, he was almoſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that
his Excellency meant me: And the next Day, as I was going to Dinner, at the
<hi>Great Looking-Glaſs</hi> in the <hi>Berge Street,</hi> where I lodged, a
Servant told me, there was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman without that would ſpeak with me.
Whereupon I went out to him, and told him, I was juſt going to Dinner. He
ſaid, he was Adjutant to his Excellency, and that I muſt preſently go
with him. Upon which I deſired his Leave to go into my Chamber, to put on
another Peruke, and that a Coach ſhould be made ready in the mean time, and
ſo I would go with him. When I came to Court, I met Viſcount
<hi>Berlin</hi> (who was then Governour of <hi>Bruſſels</hi>) in the
Anti-Chamber, who told me his Excellency was in the next Room, and would
ſpeak a Word with me; and thereupon <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0319800400:266"/> led me in to his
Excellency, who aſked me three or four Queſtions before I could anſwer
him one of them: As, what I did at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> why I went ſo often
to <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>England?</hi> I told him, I was employed by the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors at <hi>Cologne,</hi> to receive and ſend
their Letters; and that I ſhould wait upon his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in few Days, to
get an <hi>Eſcorte</hi> to carry ſome things from <hi>England</hi> to the
Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries. To which his Excellency replied, That if what I ſaid was
true, <hi>Antwerp</hi> was a fitter Place for me than <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
and that he would not permit my longer Stay at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> To which
I anſwered, That there being no open War declared between <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo long as I obeyed the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it was
lawful for me to ſtay: And beſides, that I was indebted in my Lodging, and
could not go till I had ſatisfied All. In fine, his Excellency told me,
theſe were only Excuſes which I made, and commanded Viſcount
<hi>Berlin,</hi> that the Adjutant ſhould ſee me go out of Town that Night,
and that <hi>Antwerp</hi> was a much fitter Place for me than
<hi>Bruſſels</hi>; and ſo I left his Excellency, and went preſently to
Father <hi>Patrick,</hi> who lived near the Court, to inform him of what had
happened, and deſired him to ſend to Mr. <hi>Chaumont</hi> for my Letters,
and open them in my Abſence, and then ſend them to me at Mr.
<hi>Neipho</hi>'s at <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Day the Letters came, and one from Sir <hi>Robert
Southwell</hi> to me, giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Peace ſigned that Day in
Council, <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0319800400:267"/> he being then Clerk of the Council. He told me,
the Writings were ſcarce dry upon the Council Table; but however, he thought
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give me a ſpeedy Account of it, for the Information of
others. Father <hi>Patrick</hi> carried this Letter in his Pocket late on
<hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Night, and ſaid, he came to give his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Joy of
the Peace that was made in <hi>England.</hi> His Excellency anſwered, it was
true that the Peace was made, and that he was very angry with the <hi>Marquis
de Freſno,</hi> who told him, he had been all that Day in Council, and was
ſo weary, that he could not give him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count till the next Poſt, of all
the Particulars. Whereupon Father <hi>Patrick</hi> ſaid, he would ſhew him
all the Particulars, which his Excellency was very deſirous to ſee; and
having peruſed them, he deſired to know from whom he had them; and the
Father told him, that Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> had ſent them to the
Gentleman he had ſent to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who had given him Leave to open
his Letters in his Abſence, and to ſend them to him. His Excellency
preſently ſaid, <hi>I know Sir</hi> Robert Southwell <hi>to be a very
honeſt Man, and well inclined to us; and if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman I ſent to</hi>
Antwerp <hi>keeps a Correſpondence with him, I believe he may be honeſt
alſo; and therefore I pray ſend for him back, and let him bring his little
Horſe with him, of whom I have heard great Miracles.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi>
I came back, and his Excellency ſent for Mr. <hi>Chicati</hi> (who was
Maſter of the Academy at <hi>Bruſſels</hi>) to ride the Horſe round the
Park, and to give him an <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0319800400:268"/> Account of the Horſe, who
gave ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him, that his Excellency would by all Means buy the
Horſe of me. I told him, I could not ſell him; but if his Excellency would
pleaſe to accept of him, with his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Equipage, I would
preſent him; but he refuſed to have him, unleſs he might buy him, and
ſo I ſaved my Horſe and my Honour alſo. But I muſt not forget to do
Father <hi>Patrick</hi> this Right, that upon his Excellency's commanding me
from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he forthwith wrote Word of it to the Lord
<hi>Arlington,</hi> and what Danger I did run, by being employed without a
Commiſſion. But whilſt I was at <hi>Cologne,</hi> I received this Letter
following from our Ambaſſadors Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, bearing Date in the
Afternoon of the 12th of <hi>July</hi> 1673.</p>

               <p>Upon this emergent Occaſion I got to <hi>Antwerp</hi> before
Mr. <hi>Frances,</hi> tho' he parted from <hi>Cologne</hi> in the Morning, and
I did not leave it till late in the Evening, and having ſhewed him my Letter
from the Ambaſſadors, and given him all his other Diſpatches, I
haſtened into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> after I had taken a Turn into
<hi>Holland,</hi> and viſited all Places both by Land and Sea, and from
thence I made a ſhort Step into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to give the King an
Account of what I had ſeen, which I put into Writing ſo fully to his
Majeſty's Satisfaction, that he cauſed my Relation to be entered into the
Council-Book; and having done this, I went to find my Brother <hi>Henry,</hi>
who was very private in <hi>London,</hi> after having had the Misfortune to
kill a <hi>Suſſex</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, his Neighbour, in a Duel (tho' with all
the Fairneſs and Honour ſo unfortunate an Accident is capable to have
ſaid for it) and tho' wounded himſelf, yet he was ſo ſeverely 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0319800400:270"/> proſecuted, that he muſt leave <hi>England.</hi>
Upon which Occaſion, after ſerious Conſideration of his Condition, I
moved my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, to get his Majeſty's Leave, that
my Brother might go over with me into <hi>Holland,</hi> and I would undertake
to place him where he ſhould give his Lordſhip conſtant Accounts of what
paſſed in thoſe Parts worthy his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that by his great
Diligence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſhould merit his Majeſty's Pardon, if not his
Grace and Favour. But, in order to this, I did beg his Lordſhip, that a
Letter might be written to the Maſter of the Pacquet-Boat at
<hi>Harwich,</hi> not to let the Boat go off with the Letters till my Arrival,
which ſhould be with all Speed, and that none who came with me might be
queſtioned, but that we might freely embark: Which being granted to me, I
carried my Brother, where I placed him very well for his Majeſty's Service,
which he ſo punctually performed, that he did not only get the King's Pardon
under the Great Seal, but did his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſuch farther Service, that he
was rewarded for it. From <hi>Holland</hi> I went into <hi>Flanders</hi> by the
Way of <hi>Sluys,</hi> and dined with Monſieur <hi>La Leok,</hi> the
Governour, who was Brother to Monſieur <hi>Odybe</hi> of <hi>Zealand.</hi>
From <hi>Flanders</hi> I want to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where I was not many
Days before I received a Patent from the King, to be his Agent at the Court at
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> with a civil Letter to the Governour, the <hi>Count de
Monter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> telling him, that for ſome particular Reaſons he had not
thought fit to ſend me thoſe Powers <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0319800400:271"/> ſooner, which
were antedated ſome Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Upon this I was very kindly received by
his Excellency, and from that time acknowledged for the King's Miniſter, the
greateſt Cauſe of which, next to my Diligence in the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I
muſt attribute to the Letter of Father <hi>Patrick</hi> to my Lord
<hi>Arlington,</hi> upon my being commanded from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by the
<hi>Count de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrey,</hi> and at that time acting without a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But I muſt not forget, that, at my Return to
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> I did diſſwade Father <hi>Patrick</hi> from going
into <hi>England,</hi> which before he had reſolved to do, knowing it would
not only be very prejudicial to the King, but very diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the
Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> who at that time had many conſiderable Enemies, and
that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was moved more ſtrongly againſt him, than Father
<hi>Patrick</hi>'s lodging at his Houſe in the <hi>Park,</hi> of which my
Lord's Enemies made great Uſe: But his Lordſhip was ſo wiſe as to
change the Pen for the White Staff, had the Golden Key delivered to him, and
was declared Lord Chamberlain of his Majeſty's Houſhold, and Sir
<hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> was forthwith decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſworn Secretary
of State in his Place, who ſent the ſeveral Letters of Complaint, of the
Violences committed upon our Merchants Ships, by the inſolent Capers of
<hi>Oſtend,</hi> againſt whom we could never get any Juſtice done,
du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Government of the <hi>Count de Monterrey,</hi> who would not own
the Treaty of 1667, which was the Rule we were to go by, in all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants and the <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0319800400:272"/> Capers,

and get clear and full Proofs of all Wrongs, Injuries, and Threats done, or
given out by them, againſt any <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and demand Satisfaction
of them, and at the ſame time certify them over hither, that if Juſtice be
denied there, the King may pleaſe to conſider what he will farther do; and
continue to preſs hard for ſpeedy Juſtice in the Caſe of all ſeized
Ships and Goods, and to get the Treaty of 1667 owned as the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule in
all thoſe Concerns; and be ſure to inſiſt, that it hath been allowed in

                     <p>IT is ſaid now, that our People themſelves, either out of
Ignorance or Malice, have given the <hi>Oſtenders</hi> great Advantages in
ſeveral Caſes, by confeſſing their carrying double Bills of Lading, and
caſting Papers overboard, with ſuch like indecent Practices, which in all
Times, and in all Countries, are reputed juſt Cauſe of Condemnation, as was
practiſed in <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars. If this be ſo,
they may thank themſelves if ſuch Caſes be given againſt them. But,
upon the whole Matter, the Proceedings of the Capers ſhould be ſtraitly
watched, and upon what Grounds the Sentences are pretended to be given, that
ſo the Matter may be received and judged on this Side. In the mean time, it
is manifeſt, that the King omits nothing that he can poſſibly and
lawfully do for his Subjects, who are very unjuſt and ungrateful to his
Majeſty, to lay any Part of the Blame upon the King or his Miniſters, as I
hear ſome of them do. It is neceſſary for you to have an exact Liſt of
all Ships at any time carried up by the <hi>Oſtenders,</hi> and I pray try to
get one, with Affidavits of the moſt notorious of theſe Capers, for we may
find a Way to meet with them, when they leaſt think of it. I have ſent you
an Exemplar of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of 1667, by which it will appear, how noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
their Proceedings are againſt the expreſs Words of the Treaty. What the
Secretary of his Excellency ſays, <hi>That the Way to prevent all Diſputes,
is to have a new Treaty made,</hi> is <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0319800400:274"/> true; but we
inſiſt to have the preſent Treaty executed: And if any Caſes now
ariſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no Proviſion is yet made, it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to
propoſe the having a Rule made for ſuch Caſes; but as far as the
preſent Treaty reaches, That is to be our ſtanding Rule. And as for the
Ship with Plate on board, I ſee no Reaſon That ſhould differ the Caſe,
it coming from <hi>Tangier;</hi> and let the Goods be what they would (not
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counterband) the Ship being <hi>Engliſh</hi> ought to free them: For,
by the Treaty, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship is at Liberty to carry all Goods
(even to the Enemies of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo they be not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) and
there is to be no Inquiry into her Lading, all being free, the Ship being
<hi>Engliſh.</hi>

               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> wrote to me, That denying the
Treaty of <hi>Flanders</hi> was of ſo great Concern, having been ſo long
ſince ratified, that I ſhould inform my ſelf of the <hi>Count de
Monterrey,</hi> before his Departure for <hi>Spain,</hi> whether he made any
Scruple of owning it; of which I gave Mr. Secretary an Account, that his
Excellency made Difficulty to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. Whereupon Mr. Secretary
anſwered, That he never thought it would have been a Queſtion with the
Governour of <hi>Flanders,</hi> whether a Treaty of univerſal Extent, made,
ſigned, and ratified at <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with in
<hi>Flanders?</hi> For, if <hi>Oſtend</hi> was in the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions, the Treaty reached it. Mr. Secretary, upon this,
ſent an Account to our Ambaſſador in <hi>Spain,</hi> not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat an
Order, but to expoſtulate the Matter with that Crown, and the Secretary had
for Anſwer, That they admired how his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould make a Queſtion
of obſerving that Treaty, ſo nationally ratified as it was: That then they
had ſent Orders upon it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not have thought
neceſſary. Count <hi>Monterrey</hi> did then, before his Departure, 
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0319800400:276"/> ſend a Letter to our King, to ſend over Captain
<hi>Berthold</hi> (who was then Priſoner in <hi>England</hi>) to be tryed in
<hi>Flanders</hi>; but his Majeſty would not make ſuch a Precedent
againſt himſelf, as not to vindicate his Flag's Right againſt any thing
that ſhould affront it, when he finds them in his own Dominions, and would
give this Anſwer to <hi>Baron de Bergeyk,</hi> whenever he ſhould demand
it. In the mean time, that what he wrote, was only to inform me of the State of
the Thing, that if it ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed by any of the Miniſters, I
might be furniſhed with Reaſons to defend the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my Maſter,
but not as ordered ſo to do, but as of my ſelf: That the <hi>Count de
Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrey</hi> was much miſinformed in the Matter, the Captain's refuſing
to ſtrike being witneſſed by the whole Sloop's Crew, both Officers and
Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: That this was done with reproachful Terms, commanding our Captain to
ſtrike in the Name of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> (an Inſolence never
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before, and againſt the Peace betwixt the two Crowns) and
pyratically forced away the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, being under the King's
Flag, in our own Channel: That this being the Caſe, and the Offender taken on
the King's Ground (the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi>) there could be no more
Queſtion of the King's Right to try this Man, than if he had come and robbed
in the <hi>Thames:</hi> That I might likewiſe ſay, that Captain
<hi>Berthold</hi> and his Comerades have been tryed by a Jury of Twelve Men,
Half of which (according to our Law) were Aliens, and found Guilty, and 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0319800400:277"/> have received their Sentence, and have humbly petitioned
the King, for a Releaſe of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, to which the King hath
conſented, and hath given Order accordingly; and that the Matter of the Flag,
upon the Inſult offered to Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> his Majeſty's Envoy to the
<hi>Duc de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> which Inſult was before <hi>Oſtend,</hi>
was laid by till the Arrival of <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</hi> who was daily
expected, his Goods being already come.</p>
               <p>About this time I had a Letter from Sir <hi>Joſeph
Williamſon,</hi> wherein he told me, he was ſorry to hear of nothing but
Words in the Buſineſs of our Ships: That Provocations were rather daily
renewed, than any Satisfaction given, and even Inſults of a higher Nature:
That <hi>Don Franciſco Marco de Velaſco,</hi> Envoy from the <hi>Duc de
Villa Hermoſa</hi> to compliment the King upon his coming to the Government
of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> had taken his Leave, and <hi>Don Pedro de
Ronquillos</hi> was daily expected as Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary from <hi>Spain,</hi>
who had promiſed to begin his Buſineſs with that of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships carried up by the <hi>Oſtenders</hi>; which was
become ſo clamorous a Cauſe, that, without ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Reparation, no
body knew what would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. That indeed the Inſolence of thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
was intolerable; and not only thoſe, but the <hi>Majorcans</hi> in the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> were grown inſupportable, by the Number of
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints brought daily to the King, for which he had commanded his
Ambaſſador at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to declare, that if ſpeedy and effectual
Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0319800400:278"/> were not made, his Majeſty could not
lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger withſtand the thing, and that it would be impoſſible to deny
Letters of Repriſal to ſo many crying Caſes of his Subjects that called
for them: That, it happening that the Yacht which carried Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi>
his Majeſty's Envoy to return the Compliment of the <hi>Duc de Villa
Hermoſa,</hi> coming before <hi>Oſtend,</hi> met with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Man of War, which, according to Cuſtom, he required to ſtrike, and for that
Purpoſe pierced his Rigging with ſome Shot; but the Man of War not only
finally refuſed to ſtrike, but at laſt gave the Yacht one Gun with a
Bullet in it, which was reſented as it ought to be, and put into a legal Way
of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining firſt, and would after be proceeded in according to the
ordinary Cuſtom of the Law, as a Crime of a high Miſdemeanor, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly puniſhed as ſuch by the Laws of our Kingdom; but becauſe
<hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillos</hi> was ſoon expected at <hi>London,</hi> this
Buſineſs would be deferred till his Arrival.</p>
               <p>Being informed by a Perſon of Honour at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
that the <hi>Count de Monterrey</hi> would return into <hi>Spain</hi> by the
Way of <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Excellency thought his Preſence would
not be acceptable to our King, I did thereupon acquaint Mr. Secretary
<hi>Coventry</hi> with it, who told me, That having acquainted the King with
what I wrote, his Majeſty was much ſurprized, not knowing the Cauſe for
ſuch a Jealouſy: That it was true, the daily Complaints made by his
Subjects, of the ill Treatments they received <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0319800400:279"/> from
<hi>Oſtend,</hi> and the ſmall or no Satisfaction that he had received,
notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated Letters of his Majeſty, did much
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him: But, as to the Perſon of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, the King had no
particular Diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but, on the contrary, if his Excellency
pleaſed to ſee <hi>England</hi> in his Return, he needed no way doubt of
receiving Reſpects ſuitable to his Quality, and high Employment he had in
<hi>Flanders.</hi> However, the <hi>Count de Monterrey</hi> did not think fit
to paſs thro' <hi>England</hi> in his Return, but went thro'
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>September</hi> following, the King wrote a Letter to the
<hi>Duc de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> which was ſent to me from
<hi>Windſor,</hi> to be delivered, which being faithfully tranſlated from
the <hi>French,</hi> runs thus in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

by two Privateers of <hi>Oſtend</hi> (the one commanding a Frigat of Twelve
Guns, with Two Hundred Men, the other of Six Guns, with One Hundred Men)
offered to me as well as my Subjects. A ſmall Ship carrying my Colours, and

ſtrike, which they did not only refuſe, but by an unheard of Inſolence,

But in the mean time it will ſurely be very proper for the Merchants
concerned, that by your Interceſſion they ſhould have true Copies of the

which I will ſend to the Judge of our Admiralty; and if there be real
Exceptions in Point of Law, Matter of Fact being ſtated on both Sides, our

told me you were about, and ſhould, if I had been in Town, readily have
joined with you, and, upon the leaſt Notice have come up; for it's certainly
all our Duties, and particularly mine, who have borne ſuch Offices under the 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0319800400:285"/> Crown, to improve any Opportunity of a good
Correſpondence and Underſtanding between the Royal Family and the People;
and to leave it impoſſible for the King to apprehend, that we ſtand upon
any other Terms that are not as good for him, as neceſſary for us: Neither
can we fear to be accounted Undertakers at the next Meeting of Parliament; for
I hope it ſhall never be thought unfit for any Number of Lords to give the
King privately their Opinion, when aſked, which in former Days, thro' all the
Northern Kingdoms, nothing of great Moment was acted by their Kings, without
the Advice of the moſt conſiderable and active Nobility, that were within
Diſtance, tho' they were not of the ordinary Privy-Council; ſuch
Occaſions being not always of that Nature as did require the Aſſembling
the great Council, or Parliament. Beſides, there are none ſo likely as us,
nor Time ſo proper as now, to give the only Advice I know truly ſerviceable
to the King, affectionate to the Duke, and ſecure to the Country (which is a
new Parliament) which I do undertake at any time to convince your Lordſhip,
is the clear Intereſt of all them. But, in the mean time, I muſt beg yours
and my Lord <hi>Mordaunt</hi>'s Pardon, that I come not up as I intended, for I
hear from all Quarters, of Letters from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that do give
Notice, that I am coming up to Town, that a great Office with a ſtrange Name
is preparing for me, and ſuch like. I am aſhamed I was thought ſo eaſy
a Fool by thoſe who ſhould know me better: But I aſſure your
Lordſhip, there's no Place or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0319800400:286"/> will invite
me to Court, during this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, nor until I ſee the King thinketh
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Parliaments as much his Intereſt, as they are the People's Right:
For until then, I can neither ſerve the King as I could, nor think a great
Place ſafe enough for a ſecond Adventure. When our great Men have tried a
little longer, they will be of my Mind; in the mean time, no kind of Uſage
ſhall put me out of that Duty and Reſpect I owe to the King and Duke: But I
think it would not be amiſs, for the Men that are in great Offices, who are
at Eaſe, and where they would be, to be ordinarily civil to a Man in my
Condition, ſince, they may be aſſured, that all their great Places put
together ſhall not buy me from my Principles. My Lord, I beſeech you to
impart this to the Earl of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> my Lord of
<hi>Falconbridge,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Hollis;</hi> and when you four command
me up, I will obey. I am ſorry my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> had no better
Succeſs in his Summer's Negotiation, and that his Uncle Sir <hi>William</hi>

               <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1675, the two Houſes were in a great Heat
with each other; whereupon, the Ninth of that Month, the Black Rod knocked at
the Door of the Houſe of Commons, and ſaid, the King commanded them to wait
upon him preſently in the Houſe of Lords. The King then told them, That he
had called them <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0319800400:290"/> together, to ſecure their Religion and
Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which he hoped they would have done ſucceſsfully, ſeeing he
had not offered any Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his own to hinder or obſtruct it, and
had let them ſit longer than he intended at firſt: That he deſigned only
to have adjourned them for a ſhort Time; but finding ſome of his and their
Enemies had been able to make Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between them, which could not be
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated by any thing leſs than a Prorogation, he very unwillingly
prorogued them to the 13th of <hi>October,</hi> when he hoped to meet them
again in a better Temper, without ſpringing new Differences, or reviving the
old. The Members then poſted down into their ſeveral Countries,
diſſatisfied enough, but with whom, or with what, they could not tell. They
all agreed, the King did no more than Neceſſity required him to do, and
ſome believed he had not done ſo much as he ought to have done, or muſt
quickly do; for, that a Prorogation was not likely to do the Buſineſs, but
that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament muſt be diſſolved, for that no Good could be
expected from them, and that it was loſt Labour to try them longer. After
this Prorogation, the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> appeared at Court, which was done by Permiſſion; for
the King being aſked, if he would not take it ill, if they came, his
Majeſty's Anſwer was, That he forbid no Body, without any farther
Encouragement. It ſeems the Two before-mentioned went likewiſe to St.
<hi>James</hi>'s, and were at the Duke's Riſing, <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0319800400:291"/> and
were received very kindly by his Royal Highneſs, which gave new Occaſion of
Talk, and that the latter of them two would come ſoon into Play. The
Parliament being again farther prorogued, and afterwards aſſembling, the
Lords were very hot upon the Point of the Legality of that Parliament; and tho'
thoſe that oppoſed were ſo few, that it was not worth being put to the
Queſtion, yet it laſted a long Debate, and when the Debate was over, it was
moved, that thoſe who firſt ſtirred the Scruple ſhould be puniſhed;
and then how many ſhould be accounted liable? Whether the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> who firſt moved it, or others with him? And how many,
and who? Upon which three others were named, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earls of
<hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Wharton:</hi> And a
Debate aroſe, whether thoſe Lords ſhould withdraw as criminal, till their
Puniſhment was agreed upon? The Queſtion being put, Whether the offending
Lords ſhould withdraw? it was carried in the Affirmative. Then the Houſe
called for the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was gone; upon which it was
ordered, that the Black Rod ſhould take his Grace into Cuſtody, and bring
him to the Houſe the next Day. Then the other Three were called, and
requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aſk Pardon of the King and the Houſe, which they refuſed,
and were thereupon ſent Priſoners to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The Duke of
<hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> appeared the next Day, and was ſent Priſoner to the
<hi>Tower,</hi> becauſe he refuſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make the
Acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0319800400:292"/>
                  <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 29th of
<hi>February,</hi> the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was read in
the Houſe, ſubmitting to what the Lords ſhould enjoin him, in begging
Pardon of the King and their Lordſhips. Whereupon the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor told
the Houſe, That the King had alſo received a Petition from the ſaid Earl;
but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that he endeavoured to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from their
Cenſure, by an Appeal to the King's Bench, during the Adjournment of
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, his Majeſty thought not fit to declare his Pleaſure, as to his
Enlargement, till the Houſe of Lords had taken the Caſe into their
Conſideration. Upon which, after a long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, it was ordered, That the
Records of the King's Bench Court ſhould be brought into the Houſe, and the
Earl's Buſineſs proceeded upon the next Day; when the Lords declared, That
it was a Breach of Privilege for any of their Houſe to appeal to an inferior
Court, during the Sitting of Parliament: That however, this ſhould not be any
Bar to any Plea the Earl ſhould make. However, it ſeems that, ſome Time
after, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> moved again by his Council in the King's
Bench, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>; upon which his Lordſhip was
brought thither, and the Buſineſs was agreed by Council on both Sides, and
the Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that his Lordſhip being committed by a ſuperior
Court, <hi>viz.</hi> the Houſe of Lords, of which his Lordſhip was a
Member, they could not enquire into the Legality or Illegality of his
Commitment, nor could they give him any <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0319800400:293"/> Relief, and ſo
remanded his Lordſhip back to the <hi>Tower.</hi> Upon this the Earl
petitioned the Houſe of Lords, to know whether he ſhould be releaſed or
not? To which the Lords told him, conſidering he had added a new Offence to
that for which he was committed, much more heinous than the firſt, in
applying himſelf to the King's Bench with a new <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> which
was a farther Contempt of the Authority of the Houſe of Lords, they would not
releaſe him. To which his Lordſhip anſwered, That the Crime for which he
was committed, was the only Matter in Queſtion before them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if they looked upon his Submiſſion as Satisfaction enough for the Fault he
had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he might be allowed by the Houſe to make his Application to
the King, for his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but, after a long Debate, it was carried in the
Negative, That he ſhould not be allowed by the Houſe to make his
Application to the King, and that they were reſolved not to releaſe him,
till they had examined all his Faults together. Then the Lords reſolved to
have the Earl once more before them, and having peruſed the Record of his
ſecond <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> they agreed, that his applying again to an
inferior Court, in the time of an Adjournment, which is a virtual Seſſion
of Parliament, to be relieved againſt the Judgment of the Houſe of Lords,
was a Breach of their Privileges, and reſolved, That he ſhould anſwer the
Crime at the Bar of their Houſe, the next Day; but the other Crime, far which
he was committed, ſeemed to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0319800400:294"/> In the End,
the Earl finding his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lords rejected there, for want of having
behaved himſelf with due Submiſſion and Obedience to the King, did then
again pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition his Majeſty; but either uncarefully, or too capriciouſly
inſinuated in his Petition, that he did it by Order of the Houſe of Lords,
which the King took ill, and refuſed the Petition upon it. After this, the
Lords were again upon this Buſineſs, and after many refined Queſtions,
the whole Matter hung upon ſome Words which were alledged his Lordſhip
ſhould have ſaid at the King's Bench Bar, upon his bringing his laſt
<hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and that the Words then ſpoken by his Lordſhip were
derogatory to the Houſe of Lords, and to their Power: Whereupon
Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were called in and heard, who proved ſo little to the Earl's
Diſadvantage, that he was at length called for, to make his Submiſſion to
the Houſe, which his Lordſhip did with all the Words and Ceremonies exacted
of him, ſo much to the Satisfaction of the Houſe, that they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an
Addreſs to be made to the King, to ſignify to his Majeſty, that they (the
Houſe of Lords) were entirely ſatisfied, and that the whole Buſineſs of
his Lordſhip's Enlargement, or farther Confinement, reſted with his
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: Upon which his Lordſhip was that Night remanded to the
<hi>Tower.</hi> The next Morning, the White Staves of the Lords Houſe, in the
Name of the whole Houſe, made an Addreſs to his Majeſty, in the Caſe of
the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>; and the Lord Treaſurer, the Morning 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0319800400:295"/> following, made Report to the Houſe, that his
Majeſty was ſatisfied, and that he would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſe to order,
that the ſaid Earl ſhould be delivered from the <hi>Tower,</hi> which was
done accordingly; and the next Day the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had his
Liberty, and took his Place in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
               <p>About this time I received a Letter from the King to the <hi>Duc
de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> brought me from <hi>Windſor</hi> by Mr.
<hi>Puckle,</hi> who was then employed by the Merchants. That it being long
ſince the Merchants firſt applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his Majeſty for
Redreſs in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the King having long expected, from the
Interpoſition of himſelf in that Affair, and the ſeveral Memorials given
in his Name to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> from time to time
reſiding, as alſo by his Miniſter at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that his
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would ſooner have found the good Effects of their Inſtances; but
eſpecially being ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly promiſed, upon the coming of their
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, with <hi>Sieur Decio</hi> their Fiſcal, all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences would be
ſpeedily adjuſted: Yet, to his great Diſſatisfaction he found, that
ſeveral Months had been taken up by them in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and yet the Affair
appeared ſo far from being ended, that it ſeemed to be induſtriouſly
protracted: And his Subjects therefore freſhly importuning him with
reiterated Complaints of their Oppreſſions, and imploring that he would
provide for their Satisfaction, by ſuch Ways as were agreeable to his royal
Dignity: His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty therefore calling to Mind with what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience 
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0319800400:296"/> he had waited for Reparation of their Damages, and
having uſed all amicable Ways depending upon him, was now conſtrained to
let his Excellency know, That if Juſtice were not ſpeedily adminiſtred to
his Subjects, he ſhould be obliged by the Protection he owes them, to give
them Leave to take their Satisfaction, by ſuch Ways as the Law of Nations,
and his Treaty of 1667 with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> allowed. And therefore
the King ſeriouſly deſired his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to give effectual Orders to
thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that what had been wrongfully done or taken from his
Majeſty's Subjects, by the Privateers of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> might be adjudged
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them, or their Value; that thereby the Neceſſity of
having Recourſe to ſeverer Remedies might be prevented, which his Majeſty
promiſed himſelf from his Love to Juſtice, and his great Deſire to
preſerve a good Friendſhip and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence betwixt the two Crowns.
'Tis true indeed we had better Orders from the Duke, than we had formerly from
the Count <hi>Monter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi>; but the Difference was, that the <hi>Count de
Monterrey</hi> would always have his Orders pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obeyed, and the Orders
of the <hi>Duc de Villa Hermoſa</hi> were ſeldom complied with; ſo that
his Majeſty's Subjects were very little the better for all the good Orders of
the <hi>Duc de Villa Hermoſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after this, I received a Letter from the King to the
<hi>Duc de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> which being faithfully tranſlated, run

                     <p>THE Deſire I have always had, and have, to do and perform
all things on my Part, that may effectually conduce to the conſtant
maintaining of a perfect Amity between me and my good Brother the Catholick
King; and the Care which you have alſo uſed on your Part, to the ſame
good Purpoſe, ever ſince you came to the Government of <hi>Flanders,</hi>
made me believe, that my Subjects might have exerciſed their Commerce and
Navigation, without any Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Interruption from thoſe of his
Catholick Majeſty; and the rather, becauſe you once ſent the Sieur
<hi>Decio,</hi> Fiſcal of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> hither into <hi>England,</hi> to
adjuſt ſuch Matters as were then in Difference, and to prevent the like for
the future: Notwithſtanding which, I am informed, that a Difficulty is
raiſed concerning the Liberty of Trade to my Subjects, from one Port to
another, of ſuch Countries as are in Enmity with <hi>Spain,</hi> but in Peace
and Amity with <hi>England,</hi> tho' there be not the leaſt Ground or Shadow
of any ſuch Exception between me and his Catholick Majeſty, nor is the like
practiſed or pretended by any other Nation in Amity with me. Yet the
Admiralty of <hi>Oſtend</hi> refuſeth to allow my Subjects that Liberty,
upon a Pretence that the ſaid Fiſcal, when he was lately here, had given
undeniable Arguments in that Behalf: But I am well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that, when the
ſaid Fiſcal was here, and preſented this Objection with ſome others
againſt the Liberty of Trade, Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins,</hi> Judge 
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0319800400:298"/> of my Admiralty, and Sir <hi>Robert Southwell,</hi>
Knights, being appointed to examine the Fiſcal's Papers, did make Anſwer
thereto in Writing, in the Month of <hi>July</hi> 1675, and in particular to
that very Point, touching the Right of Freedom in Trade from one Port to
another; and that never any Anſwer or Reply being made thereunto, it was
believed that the ſaid Fiſcal, and all thoſe concerned in that
Queſtion, had finally acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therein. A Copy of the Anſwer made by
the ſaid two Knights to the Fiſcal's Objection, I have cauſed to be
tranſmitted to my Reſident at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and commanded him to
impart the ſame unto you, not doubting but the Arguments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained
will appear to you ſo ſtrongly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Treaties and Reaſon, that I
ſhall not need to preſs you for Juſtice in ſo clear a Caſe; but that
that you will, of your own Accord and free Motion, adjuſt and finally
determine this Point, according to the Rules ſet down in the aforeſaid
Treaty of 1667, between me and his Catholick Majeſty, ſo as my Subjects may
receive no farther Interruption in the lawful Exerciſe of their Freedom in
Trade and Navigation, which is the only Intent of this my Letter to you, with

               <p>About this time Letters from the <hi>Hague</hi> told us, that
the States General and their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates had accepted of <hi>Nimmeguen</hi>
for the Place <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0319800400:299"/> of Treaty, at the Mediation and
Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which was forthwith
communicated to <hi>Monſieur de Ravigni,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador, who told our King, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would
not ſend his Ambaſſadors, till the Emperor had agreed to ſome
Accommodation upon the two preliminary Points, of Prince <hi>William</hi> of
<hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenberg,</hi> and the Money belonging to the <hi>French</hi> King
ſeized at <hi>Cologne.</hi> Hereupon our King ſent to his Ambaſſador at
the <hi>Hague,</hi> to preſs the States in that Matter, who anſwered, That
they did not think fit to meddle in that Matter, but left it entirely to the
Emperor's Pleaſure, whoſe Miniſter at the <hi>Hague</hi> declared in the
Name of the Emperor, That his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was willing to ſuſpend
the Proceſs againſt the Prince, and would agree, that in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Nimmeguen,</hi> Conſideration ſhould be had of that Prince's
Detention, and of ſeizing the Money at <hi>Cologne</hi>; but that the Prince
being a natural born Subject of the Emperor, he could not admit to put him into
a third Hand; upon which the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and the States were
ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1675, I had Notice given me by Mr. Secretary
<hi>Coventry,</hi> That the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved I ſhould follow the Camp,
and had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained an Allowance of 400 <hi>L. Sterling</hi> for my Equipage:
That I ſhould be careful to write all that paſſed in the Army, and leave
ſome Perſon at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to write all from thence, as fully as
I uſed to do: That the Continuance of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0319800400:300"/>
and Exactneſs was the Way to have my Pains valued, which would at laſt
bring a good Recompence with it.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1677, I was adviſed by Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>Coventry,</hi> that <hi>Mynheer van Benningham,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Envoy, had told him, that, in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>Count de Baſigni,</hi>
a Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, I had told him at
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had raiſed his
Siege of <hi>Charleroy</hi> without fighting, to make himſelf King of his own
Country, with many other things very prejudicial to the Honour and Truſt of
the Prince; which being known to the King and Duke, they were much concerned at
it: And that it would therefore become me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to apply my ſelf to
Count <hi>Baſigni,</hi> to get a Certificate from him, that I had ſaid no
ſuch thing to him. The ſame Story was alſo told me by Mr. <hi>Laury
Hyde,</hi> who was newly arrived from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court. Upon
theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, I went forthwith to Count <hi>Baſigni,</hi> and
ſhewed him Mr. Secretary's Letter, which was wrote by Order from the King.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Count de Baſigni</hi> told me, I had always been eſteemed a
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> and that I had a great Inclination for that Nation: That he
had endeavoured to do me that Right, as to aſſure the contrary, by
ſaying, I was unſatisfied at the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s raiſing his
Siege of <hi>Charleroy</hi> without fighting, which he had purpoſely done, to
make himſelf King of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Low Countries. I then aſked
him, whether he had ever heard me ſay any ſuch thing? He then 
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0319800400:301"/> confeſſed he never heard me ſay ſo, but that
what he had ſaid was in my Juſtification, and that I was not the Man that
others apprehended me to be: That I might make a good Excuſe to the
Secretary, by ſaying, <hi>Count de Baſigni</hi> not being well, was gone to
drink the <hi>Spaw</hi> Waters, and that at his Return I would get ſuch a
Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from him as was required: That in the mean time the Buſineſs
would be forgotten, and I ſhould hear no more of it. But I told him plainly,
that ſince his Tongue had been too long, in ſpeaking that, as from me,
which I never ſaid, whereby my Honour was in great Hazard, his Hand was not
too ſhort to give me Satisfaction by his Pen; which if he refuſed, he
muſt do it with his Sword, and that my Coach was at his Door, and that I
would carry him out of the Ramparts, and the Buſineſs would quickly be
decided. To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he would much more willingly give me
Satisfaction with his Sword, than with his Pen, after he had heard Maſs at
the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</hi> Upon which I left him, and went to the
<hi>Dominicans</hi>; ſoon after which, the Count came thither, and when the
Maſs was ended, we went out together to my Coach, and putting him before me,
as I was going in after him, <hi>Don Antonio de Lera,</hi> and <hi>Don Martin
de les Ries,</hi> two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers, ſtopp'd me, and ſaid we
ſhould not go together, for that they knew there was a Quarrel betwixt us,
and that they would ſecure and take <hi>Count de Baſigni</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
from me, and would forthwith give Notice <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0319800400:302"/> of it to the
Governour, Viſcount <hi>Berling:</hi> Whereupon I went into my Coach, and
ſent immediately to Mr. <hi>Lent,</hi> who was Reſident for the King of
<hi>Denmark.</hi> He came preſently to me, to whom I told all that happened:
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he offered me his Service, and ſaid he would ſtand by me, and
ſerve me in all I ſhould deſire of him. Soon after Viſcount
<hi>Berlin</hi> came to me, to let me know, that he would endeavour to
compoſe the Difference amicably between Count <hi>Baſigni</hi> and me, in
the Abſence of the <hi>Duc de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> and that he had ſecured
Count <hi>Baſigni</hi> in his own Houſe, but durſt not meddle with me,
becauſe I was a publick Miniſter; but deſired I would not ſtir abroad,
and that he hoped to compoſe the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference friendly between us. I ſent
forthwith to Mr. <hi>Hyde,</hi> to deſire him to take my Coach to <hi>Bruin
le Comte,</hi> to ſee the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to make my Excuſe
for not waiting upon his Highneſs, till I had freed my ſelf from the
Imputation that was caſt upon me. I had not been long at Home, but <hi>Count
de Tanuti,</hi> the Pope's Internuncio, accompanied with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of
<hi>Leyde,</hi> came to ſee me, and offered their Service for accommodating
the Buſineſs between us. The Internuncio told me, and ſo did the Abbot of
<hi>Leyde,</hi> that they could not adviſe <hi>Count de Baſigni</hi> to
give me ſuch a Certificate as I deſired, for that would be to give
himſelf the Lye; but I told them, he muſt either do that, or fight with me,
and that I had rather loſe my Life than my Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0319800400:303"/>In the Afternoon of the ſame Day, Mr.
<hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeca,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was Superintendant in the Place
of <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</hi> came to ſee me: Amongſt other things,
he told me, that perchance he might do me ſome Service, becauſe, by virtue
of his Office, he could examine upon Oath, any Perſon that was Priſoner
upon ſuch an Occaſion; and that if I would let him know what Queſtions he
ſhould aſk him, he would not fail to do it; and that he would take a
<hi>Commis</hi> with him, who ſhould put in Writing all that was ſaid, of
which he would give me a Copy atteſted under his Hand and Seal. Upon this I
told him, that he would pleaſe to examine Count <hi>Baſigni,</hi> how he
came to be a Priſoner? and if there was a Quarrel betwixt us? and upon what
Account? And that, whether he had heard me at any time, eſpecially ſince
the Siege of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> ſpeak any thing againſt the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> that might reflect upon his Honour, or Truſt repoſed in
him by the States General of the United Provinces? and that he, the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> did not fight then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would make himſelf King of
that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? To which Count <hi>Baſigni</hi> anſwered upon Oath, That he
never heard me ſpeak any thing tending to the Diſhonour of the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> or breaking of his Truſt to the States General; becauſe,
if he had heard any ſuch thing, he would have queſtioned me for it. When
Mr. <hi>Lyſeca</hi> gave me this Account the next Day, I told him, I ſhould
be very well ſatisfied, if he would give me three Certificates ſigned by 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0319800400:304"/> himſelf and his <hi>Commis,</hi> ſignifying what he
had told me; the one ſhould be for the King and the Duke, the ſecond for
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the third to be left in the Stadt-Houſe at
<hi>Bruſſels, in perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> which was done accordingly,
and all our Differences were amicably compoſed. The King my Maſter, with
his Royal Highneſs, were entirely ſatisfied with my Proceeding and Conduct
in this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> wrote me Word, and
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was fully ſatisfied, as Mr. <hi>Hyde</hi>
informed me, and as I underſtood afterwards from the Prince himſelf. But
this Affair ſtuck upon <hi>Count de Baſigni,</hi> as an ill Mark upon him,
who lived not many Years after it.</p>
               <p>In <hi>March</hi> 1677, the Houſe of Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that
thoſe Perſons who either adviſed, compelled, aſſiſted, or

                  <hi>May</hi> the 21ſt, the Addreſs of the Houſe of Commons
was read and agreed to, and the Privy-Counſellours of the Houſe were
ordered to know his Majeſty's Pleaſure when the Houſe ſhould wait upon
him with it. The 26th of <hi>May</hi> they attended the King in the
<hi>Banqueting-Houſe</hi> with their Addreſs. The King told them, it was of
great Weight, that he would take it into Conſideration, and return them an
Anſwer. The 28th of <hi>May</hi> he ſent for the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons into
the <hi>Banqueting-Houſe</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and gave them this
following Anſwer. That he could by no means approve of their laſt
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, for that it contained many things unfit for them to meddle with,
and which intrenched upon the undoubted Right of the Crown, whoſe Prerogative
it was to make Peace, and declare War: That his Majeſty would never ſuffer
to <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0319800400:310"/> be leſſened ſo eſſential a Part of the

in his Power, ſo he would continue to apply himſelf by all the Means he
could, to let the World ſee his Care both for the Security and Satisfaction
of his People, tho' it might not be with thoſe Advantages to them, which by
their Aſſiſtance he might have procured.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not forget to tell, that in this Year 1677, the
Houſe of Commons agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Addreſs to his Majeſty, to return him
their humble Thanks for expreſſing his great Care of the Proteſtant
Religion, in marrying his Niece to a Proteſtant Prince, and did humbly
beſeech his Majeſty to admit of no Treaty of Peace, but ſuch a one as
leaves the <hi>French</hi> King in no better State or Condition to offend his
Neighbours, than he is left by the Treaty of the <hi>Pyrrbeneans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1678, the two Houſes of Parliament met, and
the King being in his Robes in the Lords Houſe, ſent for the Houſe of
Commons to confirm their new Speaker, Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi>; after which
the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North</hi> (the Lord Chancellor being
indiſpoſed) acquainted the two Houſes, That his Majeſty hoped he
ſhould have been able at their Meeting to have told ſomething to their full
Satisfaction, but that things were not yet in that Condition, by reaſon the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador was not fully au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to treat an Alliance,
which might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the Allies, and particularly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, 
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0319800400:311"/> that the States General ſhould, in like manner as is
done in <hi>England,</hi> prohibite all Trade with <hi>France</hi>; and
therefore his Majeſty had thought fit, that they ſhould adjourn for ſome
ſhort time longer, when his Majeſty hoped he ſhould be able to tell them
the Certainty of things, upon which they might take the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that
were fit: Upon which both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament adjourned themſelves.</p>

if otherwiſe, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to provide for paying and diſbanding the
Army: To which his Majeſty was pleaſed the next Day to anſwer, That the
<hi>French</hi> King had conſented to a Ceſſation to the 27th of
<hi>July,</hi> which his Majeſty believed would be followed by a general
Peace; but that the King thought it neceſſary to keep up his Army till that
time, and therefore called upon them forthwith to provide a Subſiſtence for
them; Whereupon the <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0319800400:315"/> Houſe reſolved, that all the
Forces raiſed ſince the 29th of <hi>September</hi> laſt, be forthwith
paid and diſbanded, except thoſe Forces that were ſent to the
Plantations; and they reſolved, That a Supply be granted to his Majeſty,
towards the paying and diſbanding the Forces that have been raiſed ſince
the ſaid 29th of <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1678 ſeveral Perſons were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
for High Treaſon, and were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before the Lords of the Privy Council,
and committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> in order to their Tryal; and all that were,
or ſuſpected to be <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, were ſeized upon, and the
Houſe of Commons paſſed this following Vote, That, upon the Evidence that
had already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them, there is, and hath been, a damnable helliſh
Plot contrived and carried on by the Popiſh Recuſants, for
aſſaſſinating and murdering the King, and for ſubverting the
Government, and deſtroying the Proteſtant Religion by Law eſtabliſhed;
and ordered, that this Vote be communicated to the Lords at a Conference, and
that the Lords be then deſired to join with the Houſe of Commons, in
providing Remedies for the Safety of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſacred Perſon and
Government, and Proteſtant Religion by Law eſtabliſhed. His Majeſty was
then pleaſed to iſſue out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, requiring all Popiſh
Recuſants not to go five Miles from the Places of their Abode, and command
all of them to quit the City of <hi>London,</hi> without Exception of any
Perſon, but only foreign Miniſters; and his Majeſty <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0319800400:316"/> ſent an Anſwer in Writing by one of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Secretaries
to the Addreſs for tendering the Oaths to all Perſons reſiding in
<hi>Whitehall, St. James</hi>'s, and <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> except the
menial Servants of the Queen and Dutcheſs, who are excepted by Articles of
Marriage.</p>
               <p>Upon the 4th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1679, the King was taken at
<hi>Windſor</hi> with an Indiſpoſition ſomething like an Ague,
occaſioned by a Cold, which made him very heavy, and took away his Stomach:
The News thereof being brought to the Duke at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> his Royal
Highneſs ſent for me at Ten at Night, and then he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with his
Intention of going early the next Morning for <hi>England,</hi> and commanded
me to make his Excuſe to the <hi>Duc de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> for not taking
Leave of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, his going being ſo ſudden, private, and
unexpected. The 5th of <hi>September</hi> following I had Letters from
<hi>England,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was ſafely arrived at
<hi>Windſor,</hi> and was moſt kindly received by the King and all the
Court: That many Perſons flocked thither to ſee the Duke, and kiſs his
Hands; and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> were reſolved to
come in a Body, to pay their Reſpects to his Royal Highneſs.</p>
               <p>About this time Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> wrote me Word,
That he had received an Expreſs from <hi>Spain,</hi> which he had long
expected: That he did believe that Court would not be ſo quick in declaring a
Rupture, as ſome of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in <hi>England</hi> had been, in both
threatning <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0319800400:317"/> and adviſing it: That I might aſſure
the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> that our Maſter was never wanting in the
courteous receiving any publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, much leſs one of his Character,
and ſent from ſo great a King, whilſt they performed their Reſpects to
him; But when thoſe that are ſent to him make their Addreſſes
elſewhere, and in a Faſhion derogatory to his Government, he will let them
and the World know, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is a Monarchy, and he the Monarch;
and that no Addreſſes in his Kingdom muſt be made but to him, or by his
Approbation: That his Majeſty had had from ſeveral Hands a very good
Character of the Count and his Temper, and hoped when he came, he would bring
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders proportionable to ſuch a Temper: That the King and Duke had declared
their Conſent to the Marriage of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> with the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> which employed the Jollity of the Town that Night, which was
all at prefent from, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was about this time tryed for High
Treaſon: <hi>Oates, Bedlow, Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and <hi>Prance</hi> were
Witneſſes againſt him. <hi>Oates</hi> depoſed, That Sir <hi>George
Wakeman</hi> had, to his Knowledge, accepted of Fifteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, to
poyſon the King, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Five Thouſand Pounds of it.
<hi>Bedlow</hi> depoſed, That meeting Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> at
<hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Chamber, he had acquainted him with his Deſign of
poyſoning the King: But Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd,</hi> Clerk of the Privy
Council, depoſed, That <hi>Oates</hi> before the Council being 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0319800400:318"/> aſked, upon the firſt Diſcovery of the Plot,
whether he could ſay any thing of his own Knowledge, of Sir <hi>George
Wakeman,</hi> he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, God forbid, for he knew nothing of his own
Knowledge, but he had heard Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was to poyſon the
King. To this <hi>Oates</hi> anſwered, That at the Council he was much
diſturbed, and his Memory was by that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. And <hi>Bedlow</hi>
being aſked by the Jury, whether he had ſeen Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he met him at <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Chamber, he anſwered, No: Whereupon
the Jury reflected, that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> muſt needs be very
indiſcreet to intruſt him with ſo great a Secret; and ſo Sir <hi>George
Wakeman,</hi> with three other Priſoners, <hi>Marſhal, Corker,</hi> and a
Lay-Brother, were all abſolved after one Hour's Conſultation.
<hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Prance</hi> being the other Witneſſes, ſpake
only as to the Plot in general; ſo that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was
acquitted upon very good Reaſon, the Tryal having laſted from Eight in the
Morning till Six at Night: But the common People would have all Papiſts
hanged without more ado, and were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt both Jury and Judges,
and ſwore they were all turned Papiſts.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of <hi>July</hi> 1679, the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ordered a
Proclamation ſhould be drawn up for a new Parliament to meet the 7th of
<hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>; but the King ordered in Council at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton Court,</hi>
that the Parliament ſhould not meet till the 17th of <hi>October,</hi> the
King intending to go to <hi>Newmarket</hi> ſome time in that Month, and 
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0319800400:319"/> would after return to attend the Buſineſs in
Parliament without Intermiſſion; but this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was afterwards
prorogued from the 17th of <hi>October</hi> to the 15th of <hi>April.</hi> In
the mean time there came out every Day ſuch Swarms of impudent licentious
Libels upon all Sorts of Perſons, and upon all Subjects, printed, as the like
was never known, and will be ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued whilſt the <hi>Habeas
Corpus</hi> is ſtill in Force, and that they are ſure to be bailed.</p>
               <p>The King having written to the Univerſity of
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> to let them know how much he was diſpleaſed with the
undutiful Carriage of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> they did preſently
chuſe a new Chancellor. On the 21ſt of <hi>April</hi> 1679, the King being
in his Robes in the Houſe of Lords, and the Commons attending with their
Speaker, his Majeſty made this following Speech to them.</p>
               <q> 
                  <floatingText xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <div type="speech">
                           <opener>
                              <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I Thought it neceſſary to acquaint you what I have
done this Day, which is, that I have eſtabliſhed a new Privy-Council, the
conſtant Number of which ſhall not exceed Thirty. I have made Choice of
ſuch Perſons as are worthy and able to adviſe me: And I am reſolved in
all my weighty and important Affairs (next to the Advice of my great Council in
Parliament, with which I ſhall very often conſult) to be adviſed by this
Council. I would not make ſo great a Change without acquainting both Houſes
of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: And I deſire you will all apply your ſelves 
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0319800400:320"/> heartily (as I ſhall do) to thoſe things that are
neceſſary for the Safety of the Kingdom, and that no Time may be loſt in
it. The conſtant Number of the Council is to be Thirty, amongſt which the
Princes of the Blood, the Preſident and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are
not reckoned; becauſe it may happen there may be none of the firſt nor
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Secretary will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
there.</p>
                        </div>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>His Majeſty then told both Houſes, that he would hold no
more Cabinet Councils: A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration from the King is expected upon this
Change, which it is believed was hatched at a Meeting of the Privy Council the
Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which was ſo private, that the Clerks of the Council attending
were ordered to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, which is not uſual; and this Change did not meet
with that general Approbation of the Houſe of Commons, as a Condeſcenſion
of that Nature ſeemed to challenge, as we may perceive by deferring the
Conſideration of giving his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Thanks for his Speech, which in good
Manners they ought to have done immediately.</p>
               <p>The Day before the King declared this great Change of his
Council, the Houſe of Commons came to this Reſolution, That it was their
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being a Papiſt, and the Hopes of his
coming ſuch to the Crown, had given the greateſt Countenance and
Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the preſent Conſpiracy of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt his
Majeſty and the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and this Reſolution was ſent up
to the <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0319800400:321"/> Lords, for their Concurrence, by the Lord
<hi>Ruſſel.</hi> The Houſe of Commons made likewiſe an Addreſs to his
Majeſty in the <hi>Banqueting-Houſe,</hi> That <hi>Pickering</hi> and the
other Popiſh Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned might be ſpeedily executed. To which his
Majeſty anſwered, That he was very tender of Blood, but would ſend them
an Anſwer to their Addreſs very ſpeedily. The Commons then voted, That a
Bill ſhould be brought in, for diſabling the Duke of York to inherit the
imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and that they would ſtand by the King
with their Lives and Fortunes; and that if the King (which God forbid) ſhould
be taken away by any ſudden Accident, they would revenge him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
upon all the Papiſts in <hi>England.</hi> The Tryal of the Lords in the
<hi>Tower</hi> was deferred for ſome time, and a Committee of both Houſes
met to adjuſt the Preliminaries. The Lords have at laſt come to
Reſolution, that the Lords Spiritual have a right to ſtay in Court in all
capital Cauſes, till ſuch time as Judgment of Death comes to be pronounced,
which they have declared and explained to be, till the Houſe proceeds to the
Votes of Guilty, or Not Guilty. The Commons were not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with
this Declaration of the Lords, nor with their Lordſhips having appointed the
Tryal of the Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earl of
<hi>Danby</hi> came to his Tryal.</p>
               <p>The 9th of <hi>July</hi> 1679, the Council ordered a
Proclamation ſhould be drawn up for a new Parliament; but his Majeſty
finding that the <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0319800400:322"/> two Houſes could not agree about the
Tryal of the Lords, and that they grew to exceſſive Heats, was pleaſed to
prorogue them till the 24th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the next Day he ſent
for the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Council, and gave them Orders
to appeaſe all groundleſs Jealouſies which ſome Men endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to
raiſe in People's Minds; and the Juſtices of the Peace in
<hi>Middleſex</hi> had the like Orders given them in Council, and to proceed
to put the Laws in Execution againſt the Papiſts: And the Lord Chancellor
acquainted the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, that the King commanded them to put the
Laws exactly in Execution againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: And becauſe ſome might
pretend to be in Town as Witneſſes for the Popiſh Lords in the
<hi>Tower,</hi> and others might preſume, upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing of the
Parliament, to appear, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they durſt not do, his Majeſty
commanded to double their Diligence for finding out all Papiſts, and
proceeding to a ſpeedy Conviction of them, his Majeſty being reſolved,
that they ſhould be proceeded againſt with greater Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than if the
Parliament were ſitting, the King being abſolutely reſolved to clear the
City of Papiſts: And, a farther Mark of the King's Zeal in theſe
Proceedings was, that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſeveral Prieſts who had been
condemned ſhould be executed forthwith according to the Sentence paſſed
upon them. So much did his Majeſty's Proceedings differ now from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he had at <hi>Cologne,</hi> which was never to put the Penal Laws in
Execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0319800400:323"/>It ſeems the Lords and Commons could not
come to any Agreement about the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi> The
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons reſolved to have the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> come firſt, and to
exclude the Biſhops from ſitting ill the Court; ſo that the King was
neceſſitated to a Prorogation, to abate their Heats; and there was an
Expedient intended to be propoſed in the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Caſe,
which was, That he ſhould be perpetually baniſhed and degraded, to ſee
how that would take: But the Earl's Conſent being aſked to the
Propoſition, he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively refuſed it, and ſaid he would ſtand or
fall by his Pardon, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>The Heats which appeared upon proroguing the Parliament in
<hi>June</hi> 1679, were much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and People's Thoughts ſomewhat quieted
by what the King had pleaſed to do; ſince firſt, by giving ſtrict
Orders to the Lord Mayor and Juſtices of the Peace of
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to put the Laws in Execution againſt the Papiſts,
and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Mr. Attorney General to bring thoſe that were Priſoners for
the Plot to a ſpeedy Tryal; in commanding the Execution of the condemned
Prieſts, and in ordering an Account to be made in every County, of thoſe
Perſons that are fitting to be Juſtices of Peace, and in declaring the Duke
of <hi>York</hi> ſhould not return during the Prorogation.</p>
               <p>There was a warm Report about this time, that the Earl of
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was to leave the Council, and the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> to
be made Lord Preſident in his Place. The Occaſion of this 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0319800400:324"/> Report was, that the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> was a great
Aſſertor of the Rights of the Lords and the Biſhops, when the Earl of
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was of a contrary Opinion. It ſeems the Houſe of
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons continued very eager upon the Search of ſuch Perſons as had in the
laſt Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any Money, which was put upon the Account of
ſecret Service; and having gotten a Liſt of many Names, they examined Sir
<hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Fox,</hi> the Pay-Maſter General, if he had not payed Money to
ſuch as they named. He confeſſed, that he had payed ſeveral Sums, and
named the Perſons to whom he had payed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for ſecret Service; but the
Commons being not content with his verbal Confeſſion, they would ſee his
Books of Accompts, and ſent a Committee of the Houſe to <hi>Whitehall,</hi>
to fetch the Books; but the Lord Chamberlain told the Committee, that, by
virtue of his Office, he could not ſuffer any Search to be made in the King's
Houſe, without his Majeſty's Leave; and ſo the Committee went away
without them, but Mr. <hi>Bertie</hi> was kept in Cuſtody for not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
his Books of the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1679, Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> landed at
<hi>Greenwich,</hi> and went directly to <hi>Windſor</hi> to kiſs the
King's Hands, and was very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his Majeſty. The Duke's Arrival
at <hi>Windſor</hi> from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> incognito, was a great
Surprize to them. His Royal Highneſs was moſt kindly received by the King;
but it was not determined whether he ſhould continue in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or
return to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> Great Numbers <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0319800400:325"/> of People
of all Qualities did daily come to Court to kiſs the Duke's Hands, which
makes the World believe his Preſence is very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. About this time the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> laid down his Commiſſion of being General, and
was by his Majeſty's Command to leave <hi>England</hi> in few Days; and the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> is likewiſe to return to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> He is
at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lodged in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and will go with his Majeſty to
<hi>New-market,</hi> to which Place he is reſolved to go, tho' his
Phyſicians adviſe the contrary. It is ſaid the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>
is often in Diſcourſe with the King, not having a Mind to leave
<hi>England,</hi> and is paſſing his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don under the Great Seal, before
he goes, the King being reſolved upon his going. When the King and Queen go
to <hi>New-market,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> returns towards
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> goes for
<hi>Holland,</hi> intending to reſide at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> having lent him his Houſe at <hi>Rhenen.</hi> The Dutcheſs
does not accompany the Duke, the King having diſſwaded her from it.</p>
               <p>I was about this time informed from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that the
17th of <hi>October</hi> drawing on, when the Parliament was to meet, I
ſhould have News from thence, but they could not promiſe me it ſhould be
good at the ſame time; and from the ſame Hand I was told, that the Lord
Chief Juſtice being in his Circuit, and giving his Charge to the Grand Jury,
amongſt other things, recommended unto them the ſtrict executing the Laws
againſt Papiſts: Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> 
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0319800400:326"/> (who was in the Court upon the Bench) ſtood up and
ſaid, <hi>It was well indeed if that were done; but that the Lord Chief
Juſtice, when he gave that Charge, did not mean it ſhould be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe he was a Favourer of the Papiſts, and that he</hi> (the Duke)
<hi>knew he had private Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to aſſiſt and favour the Papiſt all he
could:</hi> Which laſt is a Reflection upon the King pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by the
Law, which declares it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay the King is a Papiſt. It is added
to me in my Letter, from a very good Hand, that the Duke did hereupon
abſcond, and that the Chief Juſtice, before he gave out his Warrant,
complained to the King, and had the King's Directions in it, and I have been
ſince told, that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was gone pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately into
<hi>Holland,</hi> and was there ſeen by them that well knew his Grace.</p>
               <p>The Parliament was prorogued this Day for Fourteen Days longer,
his Majeſty having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the Council, that he was deſirous to
ſpend ſome more Days at <hi>New-market,</hi> finding that Air very
agreeable to him; and that after his Return he had ſeveral Matters to prepare
for the Parliament, which he thought would not be unpleaſing to them, which
would not be ready againſt the Time it was at firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they ſhould
be. The Yacht that carried his Royal Highneſs to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> did
bring back the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> and the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> to
<hi>London,</hi> with the Dutcheſs of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 10th of <hi>October</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
communicated a Letter to thoſe in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0319800400:327"/> which
he had then received from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market</hi> by the King's Command, that the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> before his Return to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> had
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he might live in the Dominions of his Majeſty, rather than in
thoſe of any other Prince; and having aſked the King's Leave to go to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the King had granted it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly had ordered two
Frigates to be ready in the <hi>Downes</hi> to tranſport his Royal
Highneſs, and the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was diſpatched to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> to make Preparations for his Royal Highneſs's Reception,
which was hindered for ſome time by the unlucky Accident which happened at
Sea. However, the 12th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> both their Royal Highneſſes
arrived at Court, and were very well received by all that End of the Town, but
I know not whether I can ſay ſo much for the other: Their Stay will be
ſhort, being deſigned for <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, by his Majeſty's
Leave, they intend to reſide.</p>
               <p>The 17th of <hi>October</hi> 1679, the Parliament met, and were
prorogued to the 28th of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>; and at the ſame time, one of the
princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Secretaries of State, by his Letter to the Earl of
<hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> let his Lordſhip know, by the King's Command, that his
Majeſty intended to make no more Uſe of his Lordſhip at the Council
Table; and not only excuſed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for attending as Preſident of
the Council, but diſcharged him from his farther Attendance there; and the
24th of the ſame Month his Majeſty ordered the Earl of <hi>Radnor</hi> to
take the Place of Lord Preſident of the Council <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0319800400:328"/> Table,
in the Place of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> which the Earl of
<hi>Radnor</hi> did accordingly. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Complaint againſt Sir
<hi>Philip Lloyd,</hi> one of the Clerks of the Council, was heard, and it
being proved that Sir <hi>Philip</hi> had, in a Coffee-houſe, ſpoken ſome
Words, as if he did not believe the Plot, and beſides, ſpoke
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly at the Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>; the King, as a
Mark of his Diſpleaſure, ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him the Execution of his Place.
Then the Matter againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Williams</hi> the Chymiſt was heard;
and it appearing that, of his own Head, he had gone with pretended Meſſages
between the Duke and Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> which he then denied, as well as
ſome Words which were proved he had ſaid to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> viz.
<hi>That he knew enough to ruine the Duke and all his Party,</hi> he was, by
Order of the Council, committed to the <hi>Gate-Houſe.</hi> It ſeems Mr.
<hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and would have had the ſame Degree of
Doctor as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have had at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
him.</p>
               <p>We are told, their Royal Higneſſes, in their Paſſage for
<hi>Scotland,</hi> ſtayed ſome Days at <hi>York</hi> to reſt themſelves
before they went into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
did not ſhew that Reſpect to them which they expected; of which the King
being informed, and that their Behaviour differed much from what it did before,
at the Duke's former Paſſage there, his Majeſty was thereupon much
diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the which he ſignified to the Lord Mayor 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0319800400:329"/> and Aldermen of that City, letting them know, that his
Majeſty expects, whenever the Duke paſſes that Way again, that they treat
him in the ſame Manner as they did formerly, and that they ſhew him that
Reſpect which becomes all good Subjects to ſhew to the King's Brother. The
<hi>Scots</hi> ſeem greatly pleaſed at the Duke's Coming, and that they
ſhall have a Court kept amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 3d, 1679, I am told, they are again at
<hi>London</hi> launched into the Buſineſs of the Plot, one
<hi>Dangerfield</hi> having been ſeveral Days before the Council in
Examination; but People are not very haſty to give Credit to his Relation,
who hath been once, if not oftener, in the Pillory, and is now in
<hi>Newgate.</hi> A Proclamation is in the Preſs, and will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
iſſue out, for giving Notice, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever knows any thing of the Plot,
and does not diſcover it before the End of next <hi>February,</hi> he is to
expect the Penalty of the Law for Miſpriſion of Treaſon, and is not to
have any Benefit of Pardon. About this time there was another new Diſcoverer
of the Plot upon the King's Life come in: He was a Servant to Sir <hi>Thomas
Gaſcoign,</hi> a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentleman of a great Eſtate, and
great Age. However, he is ſent for to <hi>Whitehall</hi> by a Meſſenger.
Theſe ſeveral Diſcoverers, will, I hope, let us ſee the Bottom, or at
leaſt the End once of this Matter. I am informed from a good Hand at
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> of a warm Report ſpread abroad, that the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> Firſt Commiſſioner of the Treaſury, 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0319800400:330"/> and his Brother Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> Firſt
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of the Admiralty, are both withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from the
Court and Council, tho' there be no Reaſon yet known for it, the King not
having ſhewed any Disfavour to either of them. The Humour is much changed,
when ſuch Men quit their Places without any viſible Reaſons; and
therefore we may well think the King will be as willing to accept, as they are
to reſign.</p>
               <p>I had Letters from <hi>Whitehall</hi> of the 20th of
<hi>November,</hi> which ſaid, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came to Town
unlook'd for; that ſo ſoon as his Coming was known, the People made
Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, ſhot off Guns, and rung their Bells. He offered to ſee the King,
but his Majeſty not only refuſed him, becauſe he returned without his
Orders, but forbad him the Court, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to return within Twenty Four
Hours, when Preparations were making of new Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, which were
ſuppreſſed; and yet the Duke continued ſtill in Town, the 8th of
<hi>December,</hi> but ſtript of all Employments, and no great Talk of
him.</p>
               <p>An Addreſs hath been made to the King by Eight Lords, for the
Meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Time appointed, and the ſame has been done
by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to the King in Council, where, after the Lord
Chancellor had done, the King ſpoke himſelf, and told the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen with great Earneſtneſs, That he could not endure any longer
thoſe factious Doings, and expected the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould be
an Example to <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0319800400:331"/> the whole Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A
Proclamation was then ordered to be printed and publiſhed, to forewarn all
People from ſigning ſuch Petitions, ſhewing the Danger they will run
themſelves into by ſo doing.</p>
               <p>The 15th of <hi>October</hi> 1679, the Juſtices of
<hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were called before the Privy
Council, and were ſtrictly charged to put the Laws in Execution againſt the
Papiſts, and that they ſhould meet and conſult of ſuch Expedients as
they ſhould think moſt effectual, and return the ſame to the Board; and a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Council were appointed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to receive and
conſider of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and to propoſe ſuch other Expedients
as ſhould occur to them. Hereupon the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace of
<hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> did make their Report to the
Council, of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expedients which they had agreed to amongſt
themſelves, for the better executing the Laws againſt Papiſts, which the
Privy Council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of. It ſeems, notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
ſome ſeditious People would fain bring on the Petitions, as well about the
Court, as in <hi>Eſſex</hi>; and tho' they are not conſiderable enough to
bring the Matter to any Head, yet it may give Encouragement to others, if it be
not puniſhed: And upon Information of this, the Privy Council have ſent for
Three or Four of the principal Perſons ingaged herein, and the great
Expectation is, to ſee how they will proceed againſt them: And it is
ſuſpected, that the City of <hi>London,</hi> with ſome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties 
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0319800400:332"/> adjoining, have not quite laid aſide their Deſign of
Petitioning his Majeſty for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithſtanding there is ſmall
Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it will be to any Effect. In the mean time, the Privy Council have
taken ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions concerning the vigorous Proſecution of the
Papiſts, which will be executed without any Connivance or Partiality, and the
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Method that will be taken, is ſet down in a Proclamation that is
now in the Preſs for that Purpoſe. We are told from <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
the Duke has taken his Place in the Privy Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as
Firſt Prince of the Blood, was diſpenſed with as to taking the Oaths,
which is likewiſe the Practice in <hi>England:</hi> For, at the forming the
preſent Privy Council, all the Lords were ſworn, except Prince
<hi>Rupert,</hi> who being a Prince of the Blood, he was not ſworn.</p>
               <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1680, I received this enſuing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from
Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi>

                     <p>I Am infinitely obliged to you for your conſtant
Correſpondence. Laſt Night, a Defenſive Alliance between his Majeſty
and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſigned: It is the ſame in Effect with
that made in 1673, between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and that in
1678 between his Majeſty and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It is his Majeſty's
Inſtruction to all his Miniſters abroad, not to make any Flouriſh or
Noiſe on our Part of this League, but only to own and avow (upon all
Occaſions that ſhall be given by the Enquiries of other Men) that there 
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0319800400:333"/> is ſuch a League newly made; that it is ſuch a one
that can give no Offence or Umbrage to any Neighbour Prince, it being purely

other in their preſent Peace and Poſſeſſions, againſt any that
ſhall aggreſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade them. I am, Sir,</p>

               <p>Some time after this, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the
King and Houſe of Lords, that he might be tryed; but nothing being done in
it, his Lordſhip petitioned farther, that he might be bailed, and his Caſe
was argued by Mr. <hi>Polexton, Wallop,</hi> and <hi>Holt,</hi> and likewiſe
by my Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Subſtance of what was ſaid is reducible to Four
Heads. Firſt, The King's Prerogative. Secondly, The Liberty of the Subject.
Thirdly, The Privilege of Parliament: And Fourthly, The Juriſdiction of the
Court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It was urged, That, by bailing of my Lord, the King's
Prerogative would be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which would otherwiſe ſuffer by his
longer Confinement: For that he produced the King's Pardon, as a great Motive
to incline the Court to bail him. Beſides that, Mr. Attorney had declared the
King's particular Inclination to conſent to it; and the King having Power to
pardon a Perſon impeached (which Mr. <hi>Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſaid no Man of the
Robe ought to queſtion) tho' the Impeachment be not at his Suit, it was hoped
the Court would take ſo much Notice of <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0319800400:334"/> theſe
Intimations of his Majeſty's Juſtice, as to let my Lord out upon Bail,
whereby they would aſſert the King's true Power and juſt Prerogative; it
being hard, that there ſhall not be a Power of Bailing where there is a Power
of Pardoning.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Liberty of the Subject will be preſerved by it;
for if there be no Remedy for any Perſon impeached, but that he muſt lye by
it, till he be enlarged by the ſame Power that committed him, it would
follow, that, during the Receſſes of Parliament, a Failure of Juſtice
would ariſe, which will be a heavy Blow to that natural Freedom to which the
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>England</hi> by Birth-right are intituled; and ſuch a
Puniſhment as is not only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but may prove even an Execution
before Tryal: For probably, my Lord being oppreſſed with the Inconvenience
of the Place, and with his own Infirmities, may die in the Jayl before his
Enlargement by his Peers, and the Stain of his Impeachment dwell upon his
Memory, and his Poſterity for ever: For the Prevention of which lamentable
Caſe, and for Preſervation of that due Liberty which the King's Subjects
ought to have, it was conceived that my Lord ought to be bailed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Privileges of Parliament would not hereby be
infringed; for, to bail a Man being committed by a ſuperior Court, is not to
aſſume a Juriſdiction of his Cauſe, or any way to claim a Cognizance of
it (which it was granted the Court of King's Bench, in Caſes of 
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0319800400:335"/> Impeachment, ought not to do) but it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an
enlarging of his Priſon, or (as Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop</hi> ſaid, a lengthening of
his Chain, inſtead of his remaining <hi>in arcta cuſtodia,</hi> for ſo is
every Man let out upon good Bail preſumed to be; and the Law looks upon his
Forthcoming to be as ſecure as if he were under cloſe Confinement: So that
ſuch a Proceeding as this is not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench, or to encroach upon the
Privileges of Parliament, but only to avoid a great Evil, a Failure of
Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By bailing my Lord of <hi>Danby,</hi> the Court would
aſſert their own Juriſdiction, it being conceived that the Court of
King's Bench have always intermeddled with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and mediate Acts
relating to things done in Parliament, thereafter, as the Neceſſity of the
Caſe required (tho' not with the very things themſelves) and to that
Purpoſe ſeveral Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were cited; as one of <hi>Okey,</hi> and two
other Traitors, who were attainted in Parliament, and before Execution awarded,
there happened a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation. Whereupon the Record of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction was
removed into the King's Bench, and the Priſoners brought to the Bar, and
having nothing to ſay why Execution ſhould not be awarded againſt them,
were accordingly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. This was the Sum of what was ſaid by all thoſe
that argued. The Court was divided, whether they ſhould give their Opinion
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, or take Time; but they reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider till the next
Term, and my Lord was again remanded to Priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0319800400:336"/>Upon this Occaſion, I have thought fit
to give a Copy of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Charge, upon
ſumming up the Evidence upon the Tryal of <hi>Fitzharris</hi> in
<hi>London.</hi>

                           <p>THE Priſoner at the Bar, Gentlemen of of the Jury, is
charged with Treaſon, for Libelling the Government, and ſetting others to
do it. Whether <hi>Fitzharris</hi> be the Author of this Libel, or not, is the
Queſtion. The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him is very great. Mr. <hi>Everard</hi>
declares to you the whole Deſign and Diſcourſe with him; he tells you the
Manner, and gives you the very Grounds on which the Libel was to be written. It
was, to raiſe Sedition, to make an Inſurrection, and to ſtir up People to
rebel. Mr. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> was ſo cautious, that he walked not alone in
this Caſe, but with much Prudence declared it to others, that they might be
Witneſſes with him, and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> agrees with him in all things:
How he heard <hi>Fitzharris</hi> give the Directions for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Libel,
heard the Deſign of it, and the Reward promiſed for the doing it, which was
the firſt Night. The next Night Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was preſent,
and ſays, <hi>Fitzharris</hi> gave the ſame Inſtructions, and owned them;
and what is not to be anſwered, they are all under his own Hand; which
Directions are Treaſon enough, and is as ſtrong an Evidence againſt him
as perhaps ever was; and I think a plainer Evidence cannot be given, than that
<hi>Fitzharris</hi> is the Author of this Libel. The Witneſſes he brings
for himſelf are Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh:</hi> 
                              <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0319800400:337"/> The Firſt ſays, That, Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> told him,
this was a Deſign, and that it ſhould be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pockets of ſome
Lords and Members of Parliament, and that they ſhould be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and
queſtioned for the Libel: But Mr. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> upon his Oath teſtifies
he never ſaid any ſuch thing. Then Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> ſays, That
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome Diſcourſe with his Majeſty concerning Mr.
<hi>Fitzharris,</hi> the King ſaid, he was an ill Man, and had ſome Money
from him for ſome Service he promiſed to do him; but it can never be
thought, that the King would give Money to ſtir up his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt
him, or to hazard all that is near and dear to him: And if you believe
<hi>Fitzharris</hi>'s own Hand-writing, or any Evidence that can be given, 'tis
a plain Caſe that he is Guilty: And for ſaying, he would charge you with
his Blood, becauſe he is impeached by the Commons, that's nothing at all to
the Matter, nor are you to have any Conſideration, whether we have Power to
try him, or not; that is a Queſtion already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined: There lyes no more
before you, who are the Jury, but only to conſider, whether Guilty, or Not
Guilty. And as to the Vote of the Commons, that can no more alter the Laws of
the Land, than a Letter to us from the King, of which we are not to take
Notice, being upon our Oaths to do Juſtice, and ſee if he be Guilty, or
not. If he be Guilty, you can no more ſpare him, than condemn an innocent
Man. The Vote of the Houſe of Commons can neither excuſe us nor you: We are
to try Matters of Law, and you the Matter of Fact. But you, Mr.
<hi>Johnſon,</hi> 
                              <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0319800400:338"/> who are the Foreman of the Jury, to

<hi>Jones,</hi> when he gave the Charge to the Grand Jury; upon which all the
Judges of <hi>England</hi> met, and they all agreed we might try him: And this
was done, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all manner of Scruple that might ariſe.</p>

in Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, and the Bail each in Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds. The
Behaviour of the Duke gives the King every Day more Offence, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
his having accoſted the Earl of <hi>Hallifax</hi> with very unbecoming
Language, upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0319800400:341"/> of ſomething ſuppoſed his
Lordſhip had ſaid in Council concerning the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> The
King was pleaſed in Council to declare, That he looked upon it as an
Inſolence offered to himſelf, for any one to queſtion a Privy
Counſellour for any thing ſaid in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and did ſtrictly forbid all
Perſons having any Relation to his Service, to have for the future any
Communication with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who hath been ſo angry with
his Wife for ſeeing the Dutcheſs, by whom ſhe was very kindly received,
that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> will not ſee his Dutcheſs.</p>
               <p>An Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the
Duke, was brought againſt Mr. <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington,</hi> for Words ſpoken by him
when his Royal Highneſs dined laſt in <hi>London</hi> with the
<hi>Artillery Company.</hi> The Words ſpoken were theſe: <hi>He hath burnt
the City, and is now come to cut our Throats: Innuendo</hi> the Duke of
<hi>York.</hi> The Jury were all Gentlemen of Quality of
<hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> (which County Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> had choſen)
and they gave his Royal Highneſs One Hundred Thouſand Pounds Damage; which
will doubtleſs teach factious Perſons, who have lived of late with ſo
much Licence in their Diſcourſes, to govern their Tongues better.</p>
               <p>Letters from <hi>Scotland</hi> tell us, that Affairs go there
according to Wiſh: That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there have written a Letter of Thanks
to the King, for ſending the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which we hope will break
the Meaſures of thoſe <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0319800400:342"/> who flattered themſelves
with a Support from that Kingdom, which has not been in many Ages more united
than it is at preſent, under the prudent Conduct of his Royal Highneſs. Our
Letters from thence tell us, that the Lords of the Articles had prepared three
publick Bills; the Firſt, for recognizing the Rights of the Crown and the
Succeſſion; the Second, for continuing a Tax for Five Years longer, for
Maintainance of the ſtanding Forces: The Third, a Bill for eſtabliſhing
the Proteſtant Religion, which paſſed very chearfully in the Articles,
and Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> concurred in them all. The Letters add, That the
Duke is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed and beloved of all Sorts of People, and that there
is a conſtant and great Court of Lords and Ladies. Major <hi>Oglethorp</hi>
brings this Account, which is very pleaſing to all the People in this
Court.</p>
               <p>The Apprentices in <hi>London</hi> preſented their Petition to
his Majeſty, with Twelve Thouſand Hands, to give his Majeſty Thanks for
his late Declaration. It met with a gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and thoſe that
carried it were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Lord Chamberlain, and had the Honour to
kiſs his Majeſty's Hand. The King gave them a Brace of Bucks out of
<hi>Hyde</hi> Park, and they made a great Feaſt in <hi>London.</hi> The Duke
of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and many of the Nobility did them the Honour to be
preſent at their Feaſt, which they intend to keep annually; and the Duke of
<hi>Grafton</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> have done them the Honour
to be their Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0319800400:343"/> for the next Year. The Apprentices
of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in Imitation of thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> have
ſubſcribed an Addreſs, to give the King their moſt humble Thanks for
his gracious Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Norfolk</hi> have
done the like; and the Addreſſes from all Parts on the ſame Account come
in very faſt; and one has been preſented from the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of
<hi>London,</hi> and from <hi>Southwark,</hi> and 'tis wiſhed they may have
the good Effect they were intended for.</p>
               <p>The Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> with the Court of Aldermen,
attended the King at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> with a Petition from the Common
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, deſiring his Majeſty to aſſemble a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Lord
Chancellor, by the King's Command, gave them a very ſevere Reprimand, telling
them, that the King wondered how they durſt bring ſuch a Paper to him in
Name of the City, when it was againſt the Senſe of the beſt Part of the
City: That the King knew there were reſtleſs Spirits amongſt them, and
would ſet a Mark upon them; and that if they went on in thoſe Courſes, he
would make them ſenſible of his Diſpleaſure. The 7th of <hi>July</hi>
1681, the Lord Mayor came again to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> with a Petition of
the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the Lord Chancellor gave them an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer much like
the laſt. This Morning the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was taken by a Warrant
from Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> and his Trunks and Papers ſeized, and both
he and they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Council, where he was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0319800400:344"/> ſo privately, that all the Clerks of the Council were
turned out. It is ſaid, he was taken upon the Information of Mr.
<hi>Haynes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Macknamarra,</hi> and <hi>Ivy,</hi> who, 'tis ſaid,
corroborate the Teſtimony <hi>Fitzharris</hi> gave to Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi>
amongſt whoſe Papers is found one of Inſtructions or Directions to
<hi>Fitzharris,</hi> with ſeveral Heads of what he ſhould plead, and what
he ſhould ſwear to. The Hand is very well known, and will be made publick.
The King was preſent at this extraordinary Council held at
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was brought in
Cuſtody of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant at Arms, and was told there was a Charge of High
Treaſon againſt him, which would be proved by ſeveral Witneſſes;
whereupon he was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that Evening the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> with ſeveral Lords, went to viſit him, which
occaſioned a greater Reſtraint upon him; and he and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>
are both cloſe Priſoners, and only their Wives are permitted to come to
them.</p>
               <p>The Proceedings this Seſſion at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> were
very remarkable, moſt of the Judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and many Perſons of the
firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; as, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and ſeveral others. Mr.
<hi>Wallop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> pleaded hard for the <hi>Habeas
Corpus</hi> for the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and the Lord <hi>Howard:</hi>
But the <hi>Tower</hi> being a Priſon out of the City, and their Meeting
being only a Seſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> the
<hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> could not lye in that Court. A Bill of Indictment was
then preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0319800400:345"/> to the Grand Jury of the City of
<hi>London,</hi> againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Joyner,</hi>
as he was always called. The Witneſſes againſt him were Mr.
<hi>Smith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haynes,</hi> the two
<hi>Macknamara's,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi> They all
poſitively ſwore, that <hi>Colledge</hi> told them, there was a Deſign to
ſeize the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and bring him to <hi>London,</hi> and
there keep him, till he had complied with them, or elſe to bring him to the
Block, as they did his Father; and that in this Deſign the Houſe of Lords
and Commons were concerned, and that there was an Army ready at <hi>London</hi>
to aſſiſt them. It is certainly true, that never Men ſwore more firmly
than they did in Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jury, who demanded of the Court a Copy of
their Oaths, and that the Witneſſes might go with them, to be examined
apart; which Requeſt was granted to the Jury, and after two or three Hours
Conſideration, the Jury returned, and found the Bill <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> Upon
which the Lord Chief Juſtice demanded, whether they would give no Reaſon
for this Verdict; and whether they believed thoſe Six Witneſſes perjured?
To which they replied, That they had given their Verdict according to their
Conſciences, and that they would ſtand by it. To which the Lord Chief
Juſtice <hi>North</hi> ſaid, <hi>There was never ſuch a Verdict brought
in the World.</hi> The Grand Jury, before they were diſcharged, delivered a
Petition to the Court, deſiring the Removal of the Prieſts and Jeſuits
farther from the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> they <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0319800400:346"/>
holding Correſpondence with them. Upon bringing in this Bill <hi>Ignoramus,
Colledge</hi> will be ſent to be tryed in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the Judges
arrived the 15th of <hi>July.</hi> Their Commiſſion was opened, and the
Grand Jury was ſworn, of which Sir <hi>Thomas Spencer</hi> was Foreman; the
reſt were all Gentlemen of Loyalty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and of good
Eſtates; and upon hearing the Evidence againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> they
found the Indictment <hi>Billa vera, nemine contradicente.</hi> One of the
Evidence againſt him ſwore, That if the King did not agree with his
Parliament, there was a Deſign to ſeize upon him, and Thirty Thouſand Men
were ready in the City of <hi>London</hi> to back the Deſign; and that if the
King refuſed to paſs the Bill of Excluſion, they would ſerve him as
they did his Father. This <hi>Colledge</hi> was brought to his Tryal at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North</hi> and Juſtice
<hi>Jones.</hi> The Tryal laſted from Two in the Afternoon, till Two in the
Morning, ſo much Time was taken up in examining the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. The
Evidence againſt the Priſoner was the ſame which was at the
<hi>Old-Baily</hi>; thoſe for the Priſoner were chiefly Mr. <hi>Oates, Mow
bray,</hi> and <hi>Waldron,</hi> who ſaid, that <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and
<hi>Smith</hi> told them, they knew nothing againſt <hi>Colledge</hi>; but
they denied it upon their Oaths, and the Jury brought him in Guilty; and ſome
Hours after the Priſoner received his Sentence, the Court meeting again for
that Purpoſe. Some Days after, <hi>Colledge</hi> was executed, and his Head
was ſet <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0319800400:347"/> upon <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> to be a Warning to
others to avoid his Fate.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> finding that his
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was much ſurprized at his having taken a Commiſſion in
<hi>Holland,</hi> without his Leave, to be General of all the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces there, which hath been vacant ſince the Death of
the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> hath been perſwaded by his Friends to
reſign that Employment to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Son to Duke
<hi>Hamilton,</hi> who is now very well at the Court in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
has the King's Leave to accept of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiment in
<hi>Holland,</hi> whereof <hi>Kilpatrick</hi> was Collonel, which the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> has offered him.</p>
               <p>About this time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came for
<hi>England,</hi> and was very well received by the King and Court, and had
been ſeveral times in private with the King. Various Diſcourſes are
raiſed about his Coming, and his Return will be very ſudden. He hath been
ſomething unlucky at Play, having loſt in one Night, Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds at <hi>Baſſet.</hi> His Highneſs, whilſt in <hi>London,</hi>
lodges at <hi>Arlington-Houſe,</hi> where he hath been magnificently
entertained at the King's Charge, and hath been likewiſe treated very
ſplendidly by the Duke of <hi>Albemarle.</hi> His Highneſs was alſo
invited to dine with the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and accepted the
Invitation, and great Preparations were made for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and as he was
preparing to dine in <hi>London,</hi> he received an Expreſs from his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to come preſently to <hi>Windſor,</hi> which he did, and the
Secretary of State carried his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0319800400:348"/> After this the
Lord Mayor ſent the two Sheriffs to invite his Highneſs to dine with him,
who promiſed the next Day to dine with his Lordſhip: But the King ſent
for him again that Day; whereupon his Highneſs ſent his own Secretary to
excuſe it, and left the Lord Mayor under a very great Diſappointment: And
not many Hours before he left <hi>Windſor,</hi> a Cabinet Council was there
held concerning <hi>Flanders,</hi> wherein the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was
preſent; but the Reaſon of his Coming is ſtill kept very ſecret, which
none can tell. About this time the Lord Mayor carried up an Addreſs of the
Common Hall to the King at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and gave it to the King in
Council. Sir <hi>John Shorter,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> attended upon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, who
having preſented the Addreſs to his Majeſty, he was pleaſed to return
this Anſwer by the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and to have the Diſpoſition of the Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Money;
to which if the <hi>Prince de Parma</hi> did not agree, he was then to leave
the Government to the <hi>Marquis de Grana</hi>; but this Matter was kept very
private, and the <hi>Marquis</hi> took a private Houſe near the Court. The
<hi>Prince de Parma</hi> looking upon this as a very extraordinary Proceeding,
was reſolved to leave the Government, and uſing each Evening to take the
Air in his Coach, he went away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Liege,</hi> from whence he
ſent back his Coaches and Retinue to <hi>Count d'Arquinto,</hi> with Order to
pay his Debts. And thus the <hi>Prince de Parma</hi> quitted the Government;
and upon his retiring, the <hi>Marquis de Grana</hi> took upon him the
abſolute Government, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the King's Palace prepared for him.
But before the <hi>Prince de Parma</hi> parted, I had Letters of Credence to
him, with a Letter from the King; and beſides my particular Letters, I had a
Letter from Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> by the King's Command, dated the
29th of <hi>July</hi> 1681.</p>

<hi>London</hi>; but it was not liked upon the declining of their Affairs.</p>
               <p>The 17th of <hi>July</hi> 1682, the Common Hall of
<hi>London</hi> meeting for the Choice of a Sheriff, the Sheriffs declared to

<hi>North</hi> and <hi>Box</hi> will hold, tho' great Endeavours will be uſed
to diſſwade them; and it is believed the Proceedings of the preſent
Sheriffs will be ſeverely puniſhed. Upon the <hi>Prince de Parma</hi>'s
quitting the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the
<hi>Marquis de Grana</hi>'s taking it upon him, it's believed that Mr.
<hi>Thomas Howard</hi> will make the King's Compliment to him.</p>
               <p>About this time the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> being brought to
<hi>Hickes</hi>'s <hi>Hall,</hi> to be tryed for High Treaſon. The Grand Jury
found the Bill <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus,</hi> whereupon he was acquitted, taken out of
the Hands of Juſtice, and Medals diſperſed for his Deliverance, Treaſon
being frontleſs and ſecure. Such a bare-faced Affront to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can
ſcarce be parallelled, as was ſeen at this time, when the King was ſoon
over-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to take away the Lives of many honeſt innocent Men, purely
upon the falſe Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0319800400:360"/> of Perſons to whom
he was almoſt forced to give Penſions, being a Pack of profligated
Villains, who were kept in Pay to accuſe any Man that oppoſed their wicked
Deſigns, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Proceſs of Law, hearing their Defence, or any Proof
proferred againſt them. And after the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was thus
quitted, he retired privately into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he died in the
Beginning of 1683, of the Gout in his Stomach.</p>
               <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1683, the Lord Mayor, with moſt of the
Aldermen, Sheriffs, and Recorder, with a great Number of the principal Citizens
of <hi>London,</hi> preſented the King in Council with a Petition which had
been before agreed in their Common Council, wherein they did in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Miſcarriages in the Government of the City, promiſing all Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for

Conduct. The Petition was preſented by the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or kneeling, with the
Aldermen and all the Citizens likewiſe, till the King was pleaſed to bid
them riſe. Then the Lord Mayor and the reſt being withdrawn for ſome
time, they were called in again. Then the Lord Keeper deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them his
Majeſty's Pleaſure, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the great Cauſe of Miſlike that his
Majeſty had to their former Proceedings, telling them the particular
Regulations that he thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to require from them; concluding,
that Judgment according to Form ſhould be entered <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0319800400:361"/>
againſt them on <hi>Saturday</hi> then following (which might prove very
prejudicial to ſome of their Privileges and Cuſtoms, which were Matters of
great Profit to them, with which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty did not intend to meddle)
unleſs they did, by the Time preſcribed, voluntarily put into his
Majeſty's Hands, by ſuch Conveyance as his Attorney, Sollicitor, and
Counſel learned ſhall think fit, the Approving of the Officers that have
the principal Part in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſuch as are the Lord Mayor,

Execution of their reſpective Offices, notwithſtanding their being elected

them under his Signet and Sign Manual: And many Particulars more were told them
by my Lord Keeper. It was obſerved by every body preſent, that the
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was very cordial, and that it was a great Satisfaction to the
Citizens, that his Majeſty took this Courſe to preſerve their Peace, and
to aſſert the juſt Rights of the Crown.</p>
               <p>The next Day after there was a Common Hall in <hi>London,</hi>

voted for a Seizure, upon a Scruple of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, deſiring rather the
King ſhould take thoſe Liberties into his Hands by a Seizure, than come
into a Poſſeſſion of them by a Surrender, ſince that might blanch
ſomething upon the Oaths they took as Freemen. However, the Thing was carried
by a Fair Poll for a Surrender. Every Man is well pleaſed, except thoſe
that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, and ſome there are amongſt us ſtill, as it appears
by what is now broken out; for every body's Mouth is full of a moſt horrid
and helliſh Plot againſt the Life of the King and his Royal Highneſs,
wherein many People of the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are concerned. I cannot yet give
you any certain Account of the Particulars; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was laid in
ſhort to ſhoot the King and Duke at their coming the laſt Seaſon from
<hi>Newmarket,</hi> but was prevented by the King's ſudden coming from
thence, by reaſon of the Fire which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened there. Several Perſons are in
Cuſtody upon this Account; ſome are fled (as <hi>Good enough,</hi> the late
Under Sheriff, and one Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi>) and by the Confeſſion of one of
the Accomplices, and by the Examination of another, there was a deſperate
Deſign againſt the King's Life (whom God preſerve) and an Inſurrection
was deſigned to follow it. We have the Names of divers that are concerned,
but find the Birds are flown. I <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0319800400:363"/> ſhall be able to tell
you more by the next, when you may expect farther Particulars: But this I may
now tell you, that his Majeſty (who does upon all Occaſions too much

               <p>By another good Hand from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> of the 25th of
<hi>June</hi> 1683, I am told, that Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> the Lawyer, and

examined, and confeſſed the whole Deſign of killing the King and Duke, at

were diſappointed. It is certain, a more diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Deſign could never be
contrived, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations already taken do plainly bring it to Light.
Yeſterday the Council met, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was ordered to be forthwith
iſſued out, to tell all the World, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> and one
<hi>Ferguſon,</hi> are of the Number of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and 500
<hi>L.</hi> is offered to ſuch as ſhall bring in any of them. If the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> be guilty of this Crime, ſure it is in him more than
High Treaſon, to which the greateſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of human Laws are
aſſigned. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi> is ſent to the

The Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> are likewiſe ſent

whoſe Lodgings two ſmall Field-Pieces were found, altho' he declared at his
being taken, he had no Arms in his Houſe; and hereupon Orders were ſent out
to diſarm all diſſaffected Perſons, and a Committee of Lords were

was aſleep, or what is as bad, conſenting to it. He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have a

The Conſpiracy is confirmed by all, but eſpecially by Mr. <hi>Blaney,</hi>
who was privy to moſt of their Intrigues. His Majeſty hath given Leave to
the Lady <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to ſee her Huſband in the <hi>Tower.</hi> The
Eſcape of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> with ſome others of the
Conſpirators, is confirmed by Letters from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> being
embarqued on a Dogger Boat, with one <hi>Lock</hi> a rigid Preſbyterian, who 
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0319800400:365"/> was Maſter of her. <hi>Mead,</hi> an Independant
Miniſter, with Six more, is brought from <hi>Eſſex. Mead</hi> is ſaid
to have adminiſtred a Sacrament of Secrecy to the Conſpirators, and one
<hi>Bourn,</hi> who is ſaid to be one of thoſe that were to give the fatal
Blow.</p>
               <p>The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and ſeveral of the
Common Council, did in an humble Addreſs to the King and his Royal
Highneſs, congratulate their Delivery from the late Conſpiracy: The ſame

<hi>Walcot, Rouſe, Hone,</hi> and <hi>Blague,</hi> were arraigned
immediately; and <hi>Walcot</hi> Being brought to his Tryal, after a long
Hearing, was found Guilty of High Treaſon by the Jury. He confeſs'd he was
not to have killed the King, but had engaged himſelf to oppoſe the Guards.
This Morning, being the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and
<hi>Hone</hi> the Joyner, were brought to their Tryal, and found Guilty of High
Treaſon. At the ſame time the King being viſiting a Fortification that
was making in the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> withdrawing
into his Cloſet, cut his own Throat with his Razor, of which he died
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>The 14th of <hi>July</hi> the Privy Council met, and the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen attending, were ſent for into the Council, and
the Lord Chancellor told them, That the King had taken Notice of the irregular
Proceeding of the Common Hall about the Election of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and the great
Diſorders occaſioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and that, for the Prevention of farther
Miſchief, his Majeſty did command the Lord Mayor to begin the whole
Proceeding <hi>de novo,</hi> and that his Lordſhip ſhould take great Care
to maintain the ancient Cuſtoms of the City. <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0319800400:370"/> Whereupon
the Common Hall meeting, the Order of Council was read, and my Lord Mayor told
them, That, in Obedience to it, they were to begin their whole Proceedings
<hi>de novo,</hi> and accordingly Mr. <hi>North</hi> was put up to be
confirm'd, and the Lord Mayor declared him one of the Sheriffs. Then they were
to go to the Poll, which Sheriff <hi>Chute</hi> declared they did with a
<hi>ſalvo Jure</hi> to their former Choice, and the Sheriffs had made a
Column in their Poll Bill, to Poll negatively againſt Mr. <hi>North</hi>'s
Confirmation, with which the Lord Mayor was ſo unſatisfied, that he
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed the Poll till the next Day, intending then his own Officers to take
the Poll.</p>
               <p>The 20th of <hi>July, Walcot, Hone,</hi> and <hi>Rouſe</hi>
were executed at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the firſt of them moſt remarkably

of his own and others Guilt in this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Conſpiracy, than hath been yet
imputed to them. To morrow, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> will loſe his Head
in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> of which I had this following Account from a
very good Hand at <hi>Whitehall. On</hi> Saturday <hi>the Lord</hi> Ruſſel
<hi>was brought to the Place of his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his own Coach, accompanied
with Dr.</hi> Tillotſon <hi>and Dr.</hi> Burnet. <hi>He behaved himſelf
with great Courage. The Execution being ended, a Speech was publiſhed by his
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Direction, wherein were ſeveral Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons defaming the Juſtice
of the Nation; and Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>being ſuſpected to have had a

                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0319800400:371"/> 
                  <hi>in it, he was examined before the Council
about it; and one</hi> Johnſon, <hi>the late Lord</hi> Ruſſel<hi>'s
Chaplain, was examined, as well about the ſaid Speech, as for ſome
Paſſages in the Life of</hi> Julian the Apoſtate, <hi>whereof he was the
Author. A Declaration containing an Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of the
preſent Conſpiracy, hath been read and approved in Council, and in
purſuance of it, the</hi> 9<hi>th of</hi> September <hi>is appointed a Day of
ſolemn Thankſgiving in all Churches, for ſo great a Deliverance.</hi> At
the ſame time I am, told from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that Prince <hi>George</hi>
of <hi>Denmark</hi> was arrived; that he was a Perſon of a good Mein, and had
dined with the King, Queen, and Duke, who gave the Prince the upper Hand. The
Court will ſoon return to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where the Marriage between the
Prince and Lady <hi>Anne</hi> will be conſummated. His Preſents (which are
very noble) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her, and their Families will be ſettled after
the Manner of the Duke's and Dutcheſs's, but not ſo numerous. A Chapter
will be held at <hi>Windſor</hi> for chuſing Prince <hi>George</hi> into
the moſt noble Order of the Garter; but the Prince hath deſired it may be
deferred, till he hath written to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> for his Leave
to forbear wearing the Order of the Elephant, for that it would not be ſeemly
to wear that and the Order of the Garter at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>The King's Declaration concerning the Plot gives great
Satisfaction, wherein the particular Steps and Methods of it were ſet down;
and <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0319800400:372"/> Mr. <hi>Carlton,</hi> who is named in the King's
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, is brought up from <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> where he was ſeized;
and being very intimate with the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> he hath been
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the Council, and is ſtill in the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger's Hands, and is
putting in Writing what he knows of the Conſpiracy, which is expected to be
very conſiderable, becauſe of his known Intimacy with the late Earl. The
preſent Earl, and the Lord <hi>Aſhley</hi> his Son (who is a very hopeful
young Gentleman) have kiſſed the King's Hand at <hi>Windſor.</hi> The
King hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Royal Highneſs to forbear Hunting this Seaſon, it
not being ſafe for him at this time, when ſuch villainous Deſigns are
diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered againſt his Life. One Major <hi>Creed,</hi> and Major
<hi>Gladman,</hi> two <hi>Oliverian</hi> Officers, are both ſeized upon
Account of this Conſpiracy. Mr. <hi>Speake</hi> of <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi>
is alſo ſeized, and continues in the Cuſtody of one of the King's
Meſſengers; and Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> a great
Confidant of the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> hath been taken and examined
before the Lords of the Council, and hath ſince had his Liberty upon Bail.
The <hi>Marquis de Tilladet,</hi> and the <hi>Marquis de la Fare,</hi> were
ſent by the <hi>French</hi> King and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to
congratulate with his Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs, upon the Diſcovery
of this Conſpiracy. The King ſends the Earl of <hi>Dumbarton</hi> and the
Duke, and Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> of the Bedchamber, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with the
<hi>French</hi> King upon the Death of his Queen, which hath put our Court into

                     <p>YOur laſt private Letter, as well as your publick one, were
read before his Majeſty yeſterday in Council. Your Anſwers to the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour were well approved of, eſpecially that Article wherein you
obſerved to him, That it is out of the Sphere of any foreign Miniſters, to
take upon them to alledge, or make uſe of any Argument grounded upon the
Sentiment or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Subjects and Vaſſals of the Prince 
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0319800400:374"/> that a foreign Miniſter ſo alledging reſides with:
For Example, would the King of <hi>Spain</hi> have taken it well, that Sir
<hi>Henry Goodrick</hi> ſhould have urged, why he offered his Majeſty's
Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trage, the Sentiments or Deſires of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation,
either in their Provinces, or elſe in other Territories of the Catholick
King? Can <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillos</hi> make it out, that the City of
<hi>London</hi> does deſire, that his Majeſty ſhould embark in a War?
Does he know the Sentiments of the Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Hath he put all the Sentiments of thoſe great Bodies into
a Balance? Does he know which amongſt them will preponderate? There was a
Time (and 'tis within your Memory and mine) when not only foreign Miniſters
with Character, but their very Clerks and <hi>Valets de Chambre</hi> did meddle
with our Affairs of State, and might (as they thought) with our publick
Councils. This was an Indignity upon the King, I hope it will be ſo no more.
Sure I am of one thing, they did not do our Buſineſs, which they pretended
highly to do; if they have done their own, much good may it do them. You have
already all the Account I can give you of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
ſaving that yeſterday Evening, after Council, he came to my Office, and I
diſcharged the Sergeant at Arms that had him in Cuſtody: Then I waited upon
him, as I had been ordered, to the Duke: The Duke car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him immediately to
the King. After his Examination, the King carried him to the Queen. Then the
Duke brought him back again to his <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0319800400:375"/> own Side, to the
Dutcheſs, and he was all this Morning at Court. I am, Sir,</p>

               <p>It ſeems, the Lord Privy Seal, the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
and ſeveral other Lords of the Privy Council, knowing for certain, that the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was at Court, and had been well received and pardoned
by the King, went to viſit the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> at the
<hi>Cock-pit</hi>; and ſome People had the Confidence to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what was
publiſhed concerning the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> tho' nothing was printed
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, but by Order from the King, and Council, and entered
<hi>verbatim</hi> in the Council Book, that it might be kept in particular.
However, what was printed concerning the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> was the
Subject of much Diſcourſe, and the Whiggs and factious People had the
Impudence to ſay it was falſe, and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did
not make any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Conſpiracy; and the Thing went ſo far,
that Reports were ſpread abroad, of Diſcourſes the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> had himſelf held to that Purpoſe, and that the printed
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was injurious to him; ſo that there was a Neceſſity that ſome
publick Notice ſhould be taken of it, and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>
ſhould vindicate the King's Honour as well as his own, by owning publickly
the Confeſſion he had made to the King, in Preſence of his Royal
Highneſs, with which his Majeſty was ſo well <pb n="354" facs="tcp:0319800400:376"/>
pleaſed, as not only to grant him his Pardon, which was to paſs forthwith
under the Great Seal, but likewiſe gave him a conſiderable Sum of Money for
the Frankneſs of his Confeſſion. But upon the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s
denying what was publiſhed concerning him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared the ſame in
divers publick Places, and the Perſons being ſent for and examined, they
declared, That they heard the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> himſelf deny that he
had made any ſuch Confeſſion of the Conſpiracy; and the Factious
thereupon beginning to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with great Confidence, it was
thought abſolutely neceſſary, that publick Notice ſhould be taken of
it. Whereupon the King required the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to make a publick
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration either before the Council, or elſe to confeſs publickly what
he had declared and owned to his Majeſty, when he was firſt brought to the
King by his Royal Highneſs: But the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> then having his
Pardon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal, and the Money which the King gave him, did
abſolutely refuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to what his Majeſty ſo juſtly required
of him, and which the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhould not have made the
leaſt Scruple of doing. The King was ſo highly offended at the Duke's
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to perform ſo neceſſary a Part of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he
forthwith ordered Mr. Vice-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain <hi>Saville,</hi> to ſignify to him
his Majeſty's Pleaſure, That he ſhould not any more come into the King's
Preſence, and that he ſhould preſently leave the Court; which the Duke 
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0319800400:377"/> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did, and took a little Houſe in
<hi>Holbourn,</hi> to the Aſtoniſhment of all Men that had any Duty for the
King or Government. Upon this the Whiggs and factious People made it the great
Subject of all their Diſcourſes: Whereupon the King was pleaſed to
declare publickly, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did confeſs to him, in
Preſence of the Duke, all the Plot, and did repeat to him all the
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Particulars ſworn by the Witneſſes, and did aſſure
the King, that what the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick</hi> had ſworn
againſt <hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> was true; and that he was one of the
moſt dangerous Men to the Government in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Dominions: And yet,
at the ſame time, ſeveral Perſons of Credit depoſed, That they had
heard the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> diſown what was publiſhed about him,
and refuſed to make a publick Declaration of what he had confeſſed and
owned to the King.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, the King was pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Lords
of his Council, That having received the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> into his
Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and having ſince heard ſeveral Reports from the Duke's own Servants
and others, that the Duke had made no Confeſſion to his Majeſty of the
Conſpiracy, nor owned any Share he had in it: The King did therefore think
fit, for the Vindication of the Truth of what the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had
declared to him and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to require the ſame from him
in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Letter under his own Hand, which the ſaid Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> refuſed to do in the Terms <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0319800400:378"/> it was
commanded him: His Majeſty was ſo much offended therewith, that he had
forbid him his Preſence, and commanded him to depart the Court: And for the
farther Information of the Council, his Majeſty had directed the Letter that
the Duke had been required to ſign, to be entered in the Council Book,
declaring he did not intend it ſhould be a Secret. The Letter was as
follows.</p>

               <p>The King having made this Declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> to the Council, cauſed it to be entered in the Council
Book, <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0319800400:379"/> that Copies might be taken of it, which gave a
general and great Satisfaction; whereas many before began to be ſtaggered
with the Reports that were with ſo much Confidence, or rather Impudence,
ſpread abroad; and the great Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was, why the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>
ſhould refuſe to give the King and the World the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſigning
the above-written Paper. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> declared upon going from
his Houſe in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire privately to his
Houſe in <hi>Moore Park,</hi> but none know (at leaſt publickly) where he
now is; and I have been told from a good Hand at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that he
had written a ſubmiſſive Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King, but not being in the Terms
his Majeſty expected, he would take no Notice of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi> will executed the next Week, the
Warrant being ſigned for his Execution, and the Lord Chief Juſtice hath
committed two Perſons to <hi>Newgate,</hi> for uſing ſome ſcandalous
Expreſſions concerning Mr. <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s Tryal and Jury, it being fit
that ſome ſhould be made Examples, to teach others to govern their Tongues.
On the 7th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> was beheaded. He came on
Foot from the <hi>Tower</hi> to the Scaffold upon <hi>Tower Hill</hi>: He there
ſaluted the People, and gave the Sheriffs a Paper, which he deſired might
be communicated to the World; and kneeling down, he prayed to himſelf for
ſome Minutes, and then riſing undreſſed himſelf. The She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
aſked him, if he had nothing to ſay? who <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0319800400:380"/> anſwered,
he had nothing to ſay or to do, but to die: And being undreſſed, and
putting on his Cap, he laid himſelf down, and bid the Executioner do his
Duty, who ſtruck off his Head at one Blow. The Sheriffs carried the Paper to
the King, which was an Invective againſt the Government, his Judges, Jury,
and Witneſſes, and concludes with this Expreſſion, That he <hi>doubts
not but God Almighty will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to own the Cauſe for which he died.</hi>
He ſhewed a great Courage and Unconcernedneſs for Death; but it is to be
wiſhed he had ſhewed a more Chriſtian Temper. He had no Miniſter with
him, having a Religion of his own, and his Paper may be juſtly called, a very
venemous Libel: He ſeems to juſtify the laſt Rebellion, and prayed God
ſtill to ſupport the Old Cauſe, for which he appeared ſo eminently
heretofore. It is certain, that he carried his deteſtable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
againſt Monarchy and the eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with him to his Grave,
and gloried in his treaſonable Actions and Practices, rather than repented of
them. The Paper he gave the Sheriffs will not be printed; it begins thus:
<hi>Men, Brethren, and Fathers, Friends, Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Strangers</hi>; and
having juſtified his own Book, and exclaimed againſt the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at
his Tryal, it ends thus: <hi>By theſe means am I brought hither; the Lord
forgive their Practices, and avert the Evils which threaten the Nation from
them! Lord ſanctify theſe my Sufferings unto me! and tho' I fall a
Sacrifice to Idols, ſuffer not Idolatry to be eſtabliſhed in</hi> 
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0319800400:381"/> 
                  <hi>the Land. Bleſs thy People, and ſave them:
Defend thy own Cauſe; defend them that defend it: Stir up ſuch as are
faint, direct ſuch as are willing, confirm ſuch as waver, give Wiſdom and
Integrity to All: Order all things ſo as they may redound to thy Glory; and
grant I may die glorifying thee for all thy Mercies, and for that thou haſt
at laſt permitted me to be ſingled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth, and
even by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my Oppoſers, for <hi rend="blackletterType">The
Old Cauſe,</hi> for which thou haſt ſo often and ſo wonderfully
declared thy ſelf.</hi>

                     <p>THE Letter you ſent me by Mr. <hi>Puckle,</hi> and thoſe

Ambaſſador gave his Majeſty. I could not ſend it ſooner, becauſe it
had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Lords. I was directed by the King to give
Anſwer to it by Word of Mouth, to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> but ſtrictly
commanded not to give it in Writing, or to dictate it, that he might take a
Copy, which I did punctually obſerve; which gave him great Diſtaſte. I
ſend you the Words as near as I can, but with this ſtrict Injunction from
the King, that you do not communicate them to any Perſon; for then that which
we refuſed them will come to them another Way. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is communicated

               <p>In the Beginning of the Year following, the Court of King's
Bench gave Judgment in the great Caſe of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company,
and were unanimouſly of Opinion, that Judgment ought to be given for the
Plaintiffs, which are the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company. Their Arguments were
all reſolved into theſe two Queſtions: Firſt, Whether the Grant of a
ſole Trade to the Company, without Prohibition to all the reſt of the
King's Subjects not to trade to thoſe Parts, be a good Grant? Secondly,
Suppoſe the Grant be good, whether this Action be maintainable? And the whole
Court held in the Affirmative to both: And, that in the Firſt Point, as well
the prohibitory as the enabling Part, were conſiſtent both with the Laws of
the Land, and the Law of Nations: Which the Lord Chief Juſtice made out with
much painful Learning, by citing many Authorities and Precedents out of the
Parliament Rolls and foreign Books, whereby he proved that <hi>Jus Gentium</hi>
muſt be the Judge of foreign Trade, <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0319800400:389"/> by which it was at
firſt eſtabliſhed, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated in all other Nations. As to the
Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that this excluding Grant was a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly, he diſtinguiſhed
upon the Word, proving out of ſeveral Books of the Civil Law, that Monopolies
are of two Sorts, either Lawful, as when the Prince grants to any College a
ſole Trade excluſive of all other Perſons: Or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, according to the
vulgar Acceptation of the Word; and that this Grant is of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sort, and
not ſuch a Monopoly as the Law condemns. The Court held, That the Statute of
<hi>Edw.</hi> III. pleaded by the Defendant, had Relation only to the Trade of
the Staple, and could not be intended to controul this, which was not then in
Being. Yet, ſuppoſing the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute were powerful, and gave Licence to all
Perſons to trade every where; yet the King having, by the common Law, a Power

                     <p>I Have received your double Letter, one of the Occurrences of
the Field, and the other of a Diſcourſe you had with the Governour. They
were both read to his Majeſty, firſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, then at a Committee of
the Council. I have nothing in Command to anſwer upon them. I may only tell
you, that your Diſcourſes and Replies, in your Converſation with the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, were very well approved of. You will, I ſupoſe have heard, on
this, ſome Complaints of Mr. <hi>Chudleigh:</hi> You may believe it morally
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould have had ſuch Diſcourſes to the Deputies of
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as are endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be faſtened upon him. It is the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that alone complains of
him, and we do not hear one Syllable of this from Mr. <hi>Cittars,</hi> nor
from <hi>Monſieur le Compte de Thaun,</hi> who would have been as loud as the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, in their Complaints, had they known of any
unwarrantable Diſcourſe of Mr. <hi>Chudleigh</hi>'s in the Conferences he
may have had with any Deputies or private Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. You know,
that the King our Maſter hath of a long time (I am ſure for above a Year)
declared, <hi>Qu'il ne ſe laiſſeroit pas en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tretenir par quelle fuit dans

never fell from him. I ſhall not fail to comply with Mr. <hi>Puckle</hi>'s

               <p>I had another Letter from a good Hand at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> of
the 16th of <hi>January,</hi> 1683-4, which ſays, that Mr.

Privileges were ſeized into the King's Hands, was examined before the Lords
of the Cabinet Council, he being named in the Letter taken in <hi>Ellis</hi>'s

<hi>Slingsby Bethell,</hi> his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Collegue, when Sheriffs, was, amongſt

<hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> on Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Day, 1682, and has ever ſince been a
Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but has at laſt thought fit to pay his Fine, and is now at

<hi>Baillie,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a good Eſtate, being ſent thither to be
tryed, was found Guilty of High Treaſon, and executed: That the Earl of
<hi>Ferras</hi> had been brought to his Tryal, for being in the late

                     <p>HIS Majeſty hath received from Mr. <hi>Van Cittars,</hi> a
Memorial of ſo great a Length, that I cannot hope to ſend it you, till the

to diſpoſe the moſt Chriſtian King to give up <hi>Briſac,
Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Keil</hi> (near <hi>Straſburgh</hi>) to
the Empire, if he will keep <hi>Straſburgh</hi> to himſelf. Then, for the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> the Allies do offer (tho' without the Conſent
of <hi>Spain</hi>) to divide the Country by an imaginary Line, to the End the
<hi>French</hi> may poſſeſs all on the one Side of it, and the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> all on the other; and it is to be noted, that not only

Council, you are pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the King's Pleaſure, whether
you ſhould go into the Campaign with that Governour. His Majeſty
reſolved, that it was not neceſſary, becauſe the Scene of the War in
that Country being like to be of a very narrow Compaſs, and not far from the
Place where you have always reſided, which being the Capital of that
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will ſtill have the beſt Share in the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. One thing
that concerns my ſelf I ſhall take Leave to impart to you with a very
ſincere Joy: It is, That his Majeſty hath, upon my moſt humble, and even
importunate Suit, given me Leave, in regard of my ill Health, to reſign my
Poſt of Secretary, and hath beſtowed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Godolphin,</hi> in
whoſe Correſpondence, as far as it will take in your Deportment, you will,
I am ſure, be very happy. My great Concern is, that this being a pure Effect
of my moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Supplication, and even intolerable Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with his
Majeſty and the Duke, it may not be imputed to any Surprize upon me at Court,
much leſs to my diſliking of the preſent Meaſures there. This I ſay,
becauſe I know the Fanaticks will put the moſt malicious Conſtructions
they can invent upon an Incident at Court: But, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my honeſt Word, Sir, it
is my utter Diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſerve, and that alone, which hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon his Majeſty's infinite Clemency and Goodneſs, to conſent to my
Diſmiſſion, with ſuch <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0319800400:395"/> Marks of his Grace and
Royal Bounty, as to me are unexpreſſible. This I thought it my Duty to

                     <p>I Am ſure that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador hath
been ſpoken to, concerning the Treatment which they gave the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and has been given to underſtand
the great Reſentment the King hath of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Hereupon the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador has taken an Occaſion to ſpeak to the
King, aſſuring him, that the Civilities which were ſhewed him at
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> were purely in reſpect to his Majeſty, as being his
Son; of which I am told the King took hold, and hath cauſed a Letter to be
written to the Ambaſſador, to let that Court know the little Satisfaction
his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath in their treating the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> as they
have done; and yet the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador continues his
Inſtances, tho' he knows they cannot ſucceed to his Satisfaction. For he
that aſketh a Thing that cannot be granted, without the great Prejudice of
him that is to grant it, cannot certainly think to obtain what he deſires,
and has not ſo much Cauſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, when refuſed, as he
hath, of whom he deſires a Thing to his Prejudice. I ſuppoſe it will be
no News to tell you, that the <hi>French</hi> King hath given Aſſurances,
that after the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> he will not attempt any thing
farther in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The <hi>Count d'Araux</hi> hath declared thus
much at the <hi>Hague,</hi> upon <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0319800400:399"/> which it is not doubted
but the <hi>States</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſit ſtill, and let the

the <hi>French</hi> Propoſals. We have no News from my Lord
<hi>Dartmouth</hi> at <hi>Tangier,</hi> expecting that he is coming home, and
will be ſpeedily in <hi>England.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is highly
careſſed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> which would make me wonder what the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> aims at by ſuch a Proceeding. The King was pleaſed to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the laſt Council at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> that he thought fit
that his Royal Highneſs ſhould be preſent at the Meeting of the Council,

the Prince, who hath given the old <hi>Hoffe,</hi> where the Princeſs his
Grandmother lived, at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> We
expect daily a publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Diſcovery lately made in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> it being as plain as the Day, that the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was
ſo laid between the Rebels here and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to make an
Inſurrection in both Kingdoms at the ſame time; upon which many Gentlemen,
whom they call Lairds, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon; it appearing that the
Deſign of the Conſpiracy was to have ſurprized <hi>Berwick,</hi> and
thereby have opened their Way to <hi>New-caſtle.</hi> 
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0319800400:400"/>
By the Depoſition of one <hi>Carſtairs,</hi> who was taken in
<hi>England,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by ſeveral others, the
Correſpondence is made ſo plain between the Conſpirators here and in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> that there is no farther Doubt made of it, it being
ſufficiently made appear. But at the ſame time it is worthy Remark, that
all their Credit in <hi>Scotland</hi> could not raiſe Thirty Thouſand
Pounds to carry on their Plot. I am told from a good Hand, that
<hi>Danvers</hi> who is now in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> was the Author of that
damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Libel about the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being a Parcel of Lies
and Forgeries maliciouſly put together, to perſwade the Whiggs and the
Ignorant, that the then Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was murdered by Order from
the Government, when it was apparent that he cut his own Throat. Circular
Letters have been written by the King's Commands, to all the Lords Lieutenants
of the Counties of this Kingdom, to this Effect: That the King being informed
Reports were ſpread abroad in the Country, that his Majeſty intended to
call a Parliament, and that many Gentlemen have thereupon begun to make
Intereſts to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, his Majeſty had thought fit to let them know,
that he has not at preſent any Intention to call a Parliament; and when he
ſhall find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his Service and the publick Good, to call
one, he will cauſe timely Notice to be given thereof; and in the mean time,
commands them to take Care to ſuppreſs all ſuch falſe Reports, and to
puniſh the Authors of them. And his Majeſty being informed, that Endeavours
have <pb n="379" facs="tcp:0319800400:401"/> been uſed to promote a tumultuary Petition for
the Sitting of Parliament, his Majeſty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to cruſh ſuch
ſeditious Practices, tending to the great Diſturbance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and the publick Peace, and to enquire for the Authors and Promoters of
them.</p>
               <p>There are in <hi>London</hi> about Sixty Companies, of which
Fourty and more have already ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered their Charters to his Majeſty,
who hath been pleaſed to grant them new ones, with ſuch Alterations and
Limitations as the King thinks neceſſary for his Service; and thoſe
Companies which do yet ſtand out, will be proceeded againſt in another
Way.</p>
               <p>I am told from a very good Hand at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> by
Letter of the 13th of <hi>June</hi> 1684, That the Duke's Counſel let Mr.
<hi>Oates</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> Priſon know, that there was a
Declaration filed againſt him on the Part of the Duke, for falſe and
ſcandalous Words, and that if he pleaded not, Judgment ſhould be entered
againſt him by Default. He replied, according to his inſolent Manner, That,
as he had never loved the Duke, ſo he did not fear him, and that he would
anſwer the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when he thought fit; and that, for the entering
Judgment by Default, he could not, for he would ſtay in Priſon, till there
was a Parliament, and then he ſhould come out, and others would be in his
Place. Upon this, the Duke's Counſel moved at the King's Bench Bar, That if
<hi>Oates</hi> ſuffered Judgment to be entered by Default, in this Action of
the Duke, the <pb n="380" facs="tcp:0319800400:402"/> Court would then grant a Writ of Enquiry
of Damages to be executed at the Bar. The Aim of the Duke's Counſel in
deſiring this, is, that the Matter they charge <hi>Oates</hi> with may be
laid open to the World, by having the Witneſſes examined in open Court.</p>
               <p>The Yacht that brought over Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi>
being arrived at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> he was brought on Shore by Captain
<hi>Richardſon,</hi> the Keeper of <hi>Newgate,</hi> who put Shackles upon
him, and brought him to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where he hath been examined by a
Committee of Lords, but would confeſs nothing. It ſeems Mr.
<hi>Chud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> having Notice, that Seven or Eight <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi>
were come to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> he ſent his Secretary, who diſcovered them
at <hi>Delft,</hi> and followed them to <hi>Leyden</hi>; and having lodged them
there, he applied himſelf to the Scout, in Purſuance of an Order Mr.
<hi>Chudleigh</hi> had obtained ſome time before of the States; and having
the Scout's Aſſiſtance, he went to the Houſe where they were, and
ſeized <hi>Armſtrong</hi> without any Oppoſition. The others with him
were not meddled with, for that they were not mentioned in the Order of the
States. <hi>Armſtrong</hi> was carried to Mr. <hi>Chudleigh</hi>'s Houſe at
the <hi>Hague,</hi> and from thence on board the Yacht at <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
Since his coming to <hi>London,</hi> he hath been brought to the King's Bench,
where Execution was prayed againſt him: But he pleaded a Statute of
<hi>Edward</hi> VI. which ſays, if a Perſon outlawed yield himſelf within
a Year and Day, he ſhall be admitted to a Tryal: <pb n="381" facs="tcp:0319800400:403"/> But
he was anſwered, he did not yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but was brought in by Force,
and ſo could not claim the Benefit of that Statute. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the King had
allowed <hi>Holloway</hi> (who was likewiſe outlawed) the Liberty to
reverſe the Outlawry, and to ſtand a Tryal, and hoped he ſhould not be
denied it. He was anſwered by the Judges, that was the King's particular
Grace and Mercy, of which they were not the Diſpenſers; and that there
remained nothing for them to do, but to order his Execution, which they did
accordingly. He did not ſeem inclined to make any Confeſſion, nor to have
the Senſe that a Man ought to have that had Guilt upon him. After this, a
Motion was made on his Behalf, in the Court of Chancery, for a Writ of Error to
reverſe the Outlawry: But my Lord Keeper anſwered, he could not grant it
without Mr. Attorney's Conſent, who ſaid he had no Directions to conſent
to it. One would think Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ought not to expect any Mercy or
Favour from the King, to whom he hath been ſo ungrateful. But I muſt not
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to tell you, that when he was taken, he dropt ſome Papers into a
Houſe of Office, but they were found, and amongſt them were Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to the Sieur <hi>Dien,</hi> the
<hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Miniſter at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and another to one of
the States, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> to them in the moſt
preſſing Manner imaginable. He was executed at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> drawn
thither from <hi>Newgate</hi> upon a Sledge. He ſaluted ſeveral People as
he <pb n="382" facs="tcp:0319800400:404"/> went. He had Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> to pray with
him, and died with much Courage and Reſolution. His Head will be put up over
the <hi>Gate-houſe</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and his Quarters will be
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of in like manner. One of his Quarters will be ſent to
<hi>Stafford,</hi> for which Place he was a Burgeſs in Parliament. By his
Paper which he gave the Sheriff, he juſtifies his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and complains
that he had not a Tryal.</p>
               <p>After Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Execution, the Paper he gave the
Sheriffs was firſt brought to the King, and his Majeſty gave it again to
the Sheriffs, with Liberty to publiſh it. In it he diſowns to know of any
Plot againſt the King's Perſon and Government, and aſſerts his
Innocency to thoſe Matters. He juſtified himſelf of what was reported of
him, of betraying the King in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Time. He declared, he died a
Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but confeſſed he had not lived
according to her Rules and Doctrines. He ſaid, he died juſtly for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sins he had committed in his Life-time, and deſired thoſe he had injured to
forgive him, as he forgave every Body.</p>
               <p>About this time was <hi>Oates</hi>'s, Tryal with the Duke, where
no leſs than Ten Witneſſes ſwore, That <hi>Oates</hi> had ſaid, his
Royal Highneſs was <hi>a Traitor, a Raſcal, a Devil, the Son of a
Whore,</hi> with other Words not fit to be named, were it not to ſhew the
audacious Inſolence of <hi>Oates,</hi> who may poſſibly e'er long be
called to an Account for many other things. Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> 
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0319800400:405"/> late Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, had a
Declaration filed againſt him, for having cauſed ſeveral Papers, called
Votes and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of the Houſe of Commons, to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and
publiſhed, wherein were many ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Reflections upon his Majeſty and
his Government; of which the ſaid Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> having Notice, he did
not appear in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-hall</hi> the laſt Day of the Term, which
he never miſſed before.</p>
               <p>I was told from a good Hand at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> by Letters of
the 30th of <hi>June</hi> 1684, That the Lord Treaſurer of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
with ſeveral other Lords of that Kingdom, were come to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Court, to complain againſt the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland:</hi> That the King
and Duke had heard their Complaints, which they found ſo well grounded, that
the Great Seal was taken from the Chancellor, whoſe Name is Sir <hi>George
Gordon,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Perth</hi> was conſtituted Lord Chancellor
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Place he had of Juſtice General was given to
the Earl of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> Collonel of the Guards, and the ſaid
Regiment of Guards was given to Collonel <hi>Douglas,</hi> Brother to the Lord
Treaſurer, the Marqueſs of <hi>Queensborough,</hi> who has at preſent a
<hi>Scotch</hi> Regiment in Service of the States General; and Matters being
thus ſettled, the Lords are returning home again very well ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>I am told by a good Hand from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> That Sir
<hi>Gabriel Sylvius</hi> being returning for <hi>Holland,</hi> is charged with
a Meſſage from the <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0319800400:406"/> King to the Prince of
<hi>Orange:</hi> That the King conſidering the ill Circumſtances that
Prince had put himſelf into, the King had writ late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Prince, to
aſſure him of his Kindneſs, and that he would do all he could to
ſupport him. To which the Perſon that writes tells me, that the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> returned a very cold and indifferent Anſwer; and which is
much wondered at, that the Prince ſhould ſhew ſuch Kindneſs to the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> which neither the King nor
Duke can take well from the Prince. I am told from the ſame Hand, That the
King had taken Notice to the Envoy of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> of the great
Reſpect and Kindneſs which is ſhewed to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> at
<hi>Berlin</hi>; and his Majeſty was pleaſed to ſay, he did not think the
Elector would have given that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to one that was in his Disfavour.
But the Miniſter, to excuſe the Elector, ſaid his Electoral Highneſs,
in the Reſpect he had ſhewed to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> did it as to
his Majeſty's Son, and not to him as Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>; who is ſo
highly careſſed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> that it is thought the Prince will
make him General of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, and of all other his
Majeſty's Subjects that are in the States Service; with which his Majeſty
is ſo highly diſſatisfied, that, perhaps, at Mr. <hi>Chud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>'s
Return to the <hi>Hague,</hi> his Majeſty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment may appear more
publick.</p>
               <p>I am told, there hath lately happened a very unlucky Accident at
<hi>Norwich,</hi> betwixt <pb n="385" facs="tcp:0319800400:407"/> Mr. <hi>Bedingfield</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Barney</hi>; the firſt a Man of a very good Eſtate, and the other
an ancient Baronet; and ſome Words having paſſed between them at a
Gentleman's Houſe, <hi>Barney</hi> came behind <hi>Bedingfield,</hi> and
ſtabbed him in the Back, of which he died preſently. The Seſſions being
then there, he was tryed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and condemned, and was executed at the
Market Croſs, the Fact being ſo foul, that all Sollicitations for his Life
were ineffectual. I am told from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that the King had named
Mr. <hi>Brisbane,</hi> late Secretary of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, to go in Quality of
his Majeſty's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy Extraordinary to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the
Room of Mr. <hi>Fanſhaw,</hi> who was recalled; but Mr. <hi>Brisbane</hi>
falling ſick at <hi>Windſor,</hi> is ſince dead.</p>
               <p>By Letters of the 25th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1684, I am told,
that the King had thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Earl of <hi>Radnor</hi> from the
Preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Council, his Majeſty's Pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein
ſignified to his Lordſhip by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Secretary of State, with an
Aſſurance of the King's entire Satisfaction in his Services, and that his
Majeſty, as a Mark of it, would continue to him his Penſion which he had as
Lord Preſident. The Lord <hi>Radnor</hi>'s Anſwer was full of Duty and
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the King; who was ſo well pleaſed with it, that he
ordered the Lords of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury to take particular Care of the Payment of
the ſaid Penſion: And his Majeſty cauſed the Earl of
<hi>Rocheſter</hi> to be ſworn Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <pb n="386" facs="tcp:0319800400:408"/> of
the Council; and alſo acquainted the Lords, that his Intention was, that Mr.
<hi>Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> ſhould be made an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Baron, by the Name
of Baron <hi>Godolphin</hi> of <hi>Godolphin,</hi> and ſucceed the Lord
<hi>Rocheſter</hi> in the Place of Firſt Commiſſioner of the
Treaſury: That the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> late one of the Secretaries of
State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould ſucceed Mr. <hi>Godolphin</hi> in that
of Secretary of State of <hi>England,</hi> who was ſworn accordingly; and
that the King had given the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Sixteen Thouſand
Pounds, to be raiſed out of the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>'s Eſtate: Which Changes
were made by the King to the Satisfaction of all Parties concerned.</p>
               <p>I was told from a good Hand at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that the Duke
of <hi>Grafton</hi> was gone incognito into <hi>Holland,</hi> and would from
thence go to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to meet with his Brother the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> and then return together, after having ſeen the
Governour of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſpoken with the Reſident at
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which they both did, but could not perform what they
intended. The ſame Perſon told me, that the Diſcovery made in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> by the decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Letters, which were
owned by his Secretary, are of great Importance; which make the late horrid
Conſpiracy ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that none can doubt of it. It ſeems this
Secretary was Priſoner in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was charged with a Letter
from <hi>Argyle,</hi> which was found about him when he was taken, and a
Perſon at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> did decypher it. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary at firſt
denied it; but after having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <pb n="387" facs="tcp:0319800400:409"/> times endured the
Torture called the <hi>Boot,</hi> he had at laſt owned the Letter to be truly
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered, and confeſſed ſeveral Particulars, which make the
Conſpiracy as plain as Noon-Day. Upon this Diſcovery, the Laird of
<hi>Monroe</hi> and ſeveral others are apprehended in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and
<hi>Monroe</hi> being threatened with the Torture, hath confeſſed all, and
hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed what was evidenced by others, deſigning to make an
Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland</hi> at the ſame time it was to be in
<hi>England. Monroe</hi> is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to <hi>London,</hi> having made a very
large Confeſſion. He hath attempted, with the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his Guilt, to
deſtroy himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is looked after more cloſely. After this
<hi>Monroe</hi>'s Arrival, <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Letters, and the Confeſſion of
his Secretary and others, will be made publick, to convince World of the
helliſh Deſigns of the Conſpirators againſt the King and Government:
Tho' one would think there ſhould be none that needs be convinced, after the
plain Proofs that have already been given of them. It appears, that the
Deſign of the Conſpirators was to have ſurprized <hi>Berwick,</hi> and
thereby to have opened their Way to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> where the Plot hath
been alſo diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jeffries</hi> being
upon the Bench. Information was given him, that ſeveral conſiderable
Perſons of that Town had ſigned an Aſſociation for reforming the
Abuſes of the Government in Church and State: That the Original of this
Aſſociation was burnt, upon Diſcovery of the Plot againſt 
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0319800400:410"/> the King and Duke: But a Copy was produced to the Lord
Chief Juſtice, and one that ſigned the Original, ſwore it to be a true
Copy: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Sixteen or Seventeen principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Place were
apprehended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon for High Treaſon, before the
Aſſizes were there ended; and ſince the Lord Chief Juſtice
<hi>Jeffries</hi>'s Return, he hath given an Account thereof to the King: As
alſo, that many Corporations in his Circuit had ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Charters
to ſuch Alterations as his Majeſty hath thought neceſſary for
ſecuring the Government in good and loyal Hands. The City of <hi>York</hi> as
well as <hi>London,</hi> is now governed by Commiſſion, their Charter being
ſeized into the King's Hands, who out of his natural Goodneſs will grant
them new Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. A <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> being ſent down againſt the
Charter of the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſolved to lay
their Charter at the King's Feet, and to make ſuch a Reſignation thereof as
his Majeſty ſhall think fit: By which may be ſeen the general Duty of his
Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to his Royal Authority. A great Change in few Months!
which next to the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, is to be attributed to his
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's great Prudence and Conduct.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jeffries</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from
his Circuit, is gone to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to lay at his Majeſty's Feet
ſeveral Charters that were ſurrendered to him in his Circuit, where moſt
Corporations have ſubmitted to his Majeſty's good Pleaſure therein. Their
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties <pb n="389" facs="tcp:0319800400:411"/> are returned from <hi>Wincheſter,</hi>
and their Royal Highneſſes, with the Prince and Princeſs of
<hi>Denmark</hi> the Day before; the King and Duke, ſince the Diſcovery of
the Conſpiracy, never travelling the ſame Day together.</p>
               <p>This Week Mr. <hi>Roſewell,</hi> a Nonconformiſt Preacher,
was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> having uttered treaſonable Words, as he
was holding forth in a Conventicle. He will not be tryed at the <hi>Old
Baily,</hi> but at the King's Bench Bar, the next Term. The Words he is charged
with are very ſeditious and treaſonable, and as well againſt the late
King as the preſent Government, and are proved by ſo many Witneſſes,
that he is like to paſs his Time very ill.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget to tell, that upon Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Jenkins</hi>'s laying down, with the King's Leave, his being Principal
Secretary of State, I was then put into the Province of the Earl of
<hi>Sunderland,</hi> who wrote me this following Letter, dated the 25th of

               <p>About this time the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador in
<hi>England, Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</hi> took an Occaſion to ſpeak with
the King my Maſter in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Behalf, by Order from
the <hi>Marquis de Grana,</hi> then Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh

was ſent to me to deliver; wherein his Majeſty let the Marquis know, how
much he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, which I repreſented to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the beſt Terms I

the great Enemy of the Duke <pb n="391" facs="tcp:0319800400:413"/> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom
the King loved as he did his Eyes, and endeavoured to perſwade me to ſhew
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> great Civilities. I told his Excellency, that I
was abſolutely to obey my Maſter, who had commanded me not to own him, and

King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Maſter, in what ill Circumſtances the Duke of

               <p>It was a ſtrange Ingratitude in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
who was in quiet Poſſeſſion of all Places of Truſt, Profit, or
Honour, which could make him either happy or ſerviceable for the Government,
or grateful to the People, to be engaged in a Conſpiracy which was againſt
Religion, Morality, and the common Senſe of Humanity, and the higheſt
Ingratitude to the King his Father, and even to Heaven it ſelf. Certainly
this counterfeit <hi>Abſalom</hi> took a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to exceed in Wickedneſs,
that no Man ſhould be ſo infamous as himſelf; who with the Gracefulneſs
of his Perſon, with his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity and other ſiniſter and baſe
Artifices, had ſtrangely inſinuated himſelf amongſt the worſt of Men,
the common People; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſpiracy broke out, he made ſome
Voyages into the Country, and addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Populace, like
another <hi>Abſalom,</hi> which went to his Royal Father's Heart. His
rebellious Son <hi>Abſalom!</hi> who was no ſooner gone from his Father's
Preſence, but he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſteal away the Hearts of his People, and
alienate the Affections of his Subjects from <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0319800400:414"/> their
Obedience. His ambitious Son! whom no Preferments could content: His ungrateful
Son! with his artificial Submiſſion at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Feet; but was no
ſooner gone from his Preſence, but denied all he had confeſſed: And yet
his royal and indulgent Father was willing to forget

eſt.</hi> It is too often the ill Fortune of Kings to be ill ſpoken of,
when they do beſt for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Good. For after our blood-thirſty
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels had murdered their late King, and brought the Nation
to great Confuſion, which continued for ſome Years, when God was
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly pleaſed to reſtore them to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government, by
ſending them their own King: Yet were the People ſo ungrateful, that in
place of praiſing God for ſo great a Benefit, like the ancient
<hi>Jews,</hi> they complained and murmured at that very Time when God was
leading them into the Land of Promiſe, into Peace and Plenty; they wiſhed
themſelves back in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whining after their Leeks and Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and
deſiring their former Slavery: Even ſo at this time, Conventicles, by their
leering Whines, and their melting Complaints, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the ſad Times
that were coming, even the Coffee-houſes croaked with the Noiſe of it, and
there came out every Day ſome compleat Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Print, ſuch as the
<hi>Popiſh Counſellour Julian.</hi> Now, when People's Heads are once
actuated with ſuch Hurricanes of Jealouſies and <pb n="393" facs="tcp:0319800400:415"/>
Fears, and that their Religion, Properties and Liberties are pulling down, what
can ſtop their Rage from attempting or believing any thing that is moſt
unreaſonable and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the Senſe of their own Good? The People
at this time were ſoon overperſwaded to entertain Fears of the Loſs of
that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which no Nation under Heaven was more ſecure; and yet Men
were ſo befooled, to undertake that which would certainly bring them to
Tyranny and Slavery. And from hence this King <hi>Charles</hi> II. felt the
Rage of that rebellious Faction in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which endeavoured
to make his Majeſty cheap abroad, and contemptible at Home, by arraigning the
Juſtice of his Government, and exciting a Hatred of the King's Perſon, and
did infeſt the Nation with Swarms of peſtilent Libels, which like Locuſts
overſpread the Land, poiſoned the Minds of the People, and drowned all the
little Remains of Duty, Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, Civility, and common Honeſty, offering
to remove from the King the very Guards of his royal Perſon, by precluding
the Advantage he might take of his own Revenues, by their unwarrantable and
unreaſonable Votes, which expoſed his Majeſty to all Dangers that might
happen, by endeavouring to deprive him of the Poſſibility of ſupporting
the Government, by running down the King and all his loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the
late woful, or worſer Evils and Events, to which the rebellious Senate of
1641 had brought the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0319800400:416"/>Now when ſuch a Number of diſcontented
People are aſſembled, pretending their Religion is in Danger, this does
influence them to the higheſt Reſolution of acting, be the Attempts never
ſo hazardous; and we may very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Religion, Liberty and
Property, were loſt and gone, when Monarchy by the Long Parliament was taken
away, and could never be revived, till Monarchy was moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reſtored;
and if this Conſpiracy had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, we had been worſe than ever. About
this time we heard every Day new Stories of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with many ſcurrilous Reflections upon the King; and if any Man
durſt ſhew his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the Monarchy, by oppoſing their
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonarchical Principles, he was preſently blaſted with the Name of a
Court or a Church Papiſt. How unwarrantable were the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and
ſeditious Votes of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and their pragmatical
intermeddling with the Succeſſion; a Thing top ſacred to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by
their unhallowed Hands! it being the Belief of all good, as well as learned
Men, that no Power under Heaven can hinder the Deſcent of the Crown upon the
next Heir of the Blood, which is his unalterable Right by Religion, Law,
Hiſtory and Reaſon: Yet the Houſe of Commons reſolved againſt it, and
would not be undeceived by undeniable Arguments: Nay, they voted, they would
make his Majeſty a Glorious King, with a better Revenue than any of his
Predeceſſors, by taking away all his <pb n="395" facs="tcp:0319800400:417"/> kingly Power,
ſo that he ſhould not be able to ſupport his Friends, or ſuppreſs his
Enemies. Nay, they voted, That whoſoever ſhould lend the King any Money
upon the ſeveral Branches of his Revenue, ſhould anſwer it in Parliament;
whereby they not only took away all Hopes of neceſſary Supplies, but tied
the Hands of the King's faithful Subjects, and would have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to a
more helpleſs Condition than the meaneſt of his Subjects: And they
aſſumed a Power to themſelves of ſuſpending Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by
reſolving, that the Proſecution of Diſſenters upon the Penal Laws, was
grievous to the Subject, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom; and nothing
would ſerve theſe ill-natured Gentlemen, but a total Excluſion of his
Royal Highneſs's ſucceeding to the Crown, to which the King had often and
poſitively told them, he could neither in Honour, Conſcience, or Juſtice
conſent; and yet, inſtead of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Majeſty's Honour and
Greatneſs, they perſiſted reſolute in what they demanded. When the King
ſaw they went ſo faſt, he thought it high Time to prorogue them, which he
did ſeveral times, in hopes of their agreeing at laſt; but they were
ſtill ſo unhappy as not to agree, which rendered the Friendſhip of
<hi>England</hi> unſafe to truſt to, and which made our warlike wary
Neighbours take other Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby we gratified our Enemies, and
diſcouraged our Friends by our unſeaſonable Diſputes. And indeed the
Calling of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments does ſometimes great Hurt, when more 
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0319800400:418"/> Men are called together, than can be united in
Affections and Intereſts, and they rather break into Factions, than join in
publick Intereſt; from whence have riſen thoſe dangerous Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which
ruined the Peace and Happineſs of our Nation.</p>
               <p>Sovereign Princes, as ours in <hi>England,</hi> have ever been
God's Vicegerents upon Earth, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Power and Authority from him
alone who hath delegated Part of his own Power to Kings, and ſtampt his own
Character upon them; and therefore we are never to ſpeak rudely to them, nor
deſign any Evil againſt them: And the primitive Fathers often acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Heathen Emperors to be conſtituted by God, and to hold their Empire from
him only, and to have God only above them: And therefore, in the early Ages of
the Church, the Doctrine of Queſtioning the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate was
unknown, and there was no ſuch thing as Rebellion in the firſt Centuries of
the Church; and whatſoever the Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were, which differ
according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of their Country, yet the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority it
ſelf is derived from God, and never received of the People in Truſt; nor is
the ſovereign Power anſwerable to the People for the Adminiſtration of
it. But when Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to think, that the King is the People's Creature,
deriving his Power and Truſt from them, they will implead the King's
Authority, as a conditional and precarious Thing, and upon the leaſt
Diſtruſt, will meditate a Revocation <pb n="397" facs="tcp:0319800400:419"/> of their
Truſt; ſo that whatſoever is done, the King muſt anſwer for it: So
apt are reſty Men to clamour againſt their own Happineſs, and to promote
the Steps of their own Ruine. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who was a great and a wiſe
King, had ſome Hundreds of ſtrange Wives, contrary to the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and by reaſon of them, he fell to Idolatry; yet neither
Prieſt nor People took up Arms againſt him, but left it to God, who is the
proper Judge of Kings, who, in the Time appointed by his divine Providence,
raiſed up <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to chaſtiſe him in his Son.</p>
               <p>I know, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays, That the Magiſtrates, or any
Part of the Realm, may reſiſt the King, being an Idolater, as <hi>Jehu</hi>
revolted from <hi>Joram,</hi> when he forſook God. Nay, he ſays farther,
the Government of the Kingdom is not given to the King alone; and that there is
a Stipulation in all hereditary Kingdoms: As in <hi>France,</hi> when the King
is crowned, the Biſhops of <hi>Bauvais</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> aſk the
People, if they deſire and command this Man to be King. But ſurely
<hi>Calvin</hi> forgot that he was born at <hi>Noyon</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi>
and that this is no Argument that they choſe him to be King, much leſs that
they make him ſuch: For this is an Acceptation only, and not an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a
Declaration of their willing Subjection, and nothing elſe; the Kingdom was
confeſſed before to be hereditary, and the Succeſſion was determined by
Law. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> count the Time of their
Reign from their Entrance to the Crown. And was not <hi>Henry</hi> VII.
ſeveral Years before he was crowned? <pb n="398" facs="tcp:0319800400:420"/> The Peers are
<hi>Pares inter ſe,</hi> but not Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to the King. In <hi>England</hi>
all the Power and Authority depends upon the King, and the State is nothing but
the Authority of the King, who is the Fountain whence ſprings all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Nobility. He ſummons the great Council the Parliament, and diſſolves
them when he pleaſes: And he that would reſtrain Sovereignty within any
narrower Bounds, or communicate it to others, makes no Difference between the
Crown of a King, and the Bonnet of a Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi> I know,
<hi>Buchanan</hi> ſays, Princes may be depoſed by the People, if they be
Enemies to God and his Truth; and that their Subjects are freed from their
Oaths and their Obedience, and that the People are above the King, and of
greater Authority than he. The Caſe of the idolatrous <hi>Iraelites</hi> was
plain, the People acted nothing but by the Command of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was
ſupreme Magiſtrate, neither did he command any thing to be done, but from
the Mouth of God, according to the expreſs Law, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>This is not to put the Sword into the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Hands, and to
permit them to execute their fiery Zeal upon whom they pleaſe, under
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of rooting out Superſtition, eſpecially ſuch as no Man judges
ſo but themſelves. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution in Matters of Religion is not the beſt
Way to advance Religion, which is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wiſe and learned Men, even
of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and better than any can be ſhewed for the contrary.
<hi>Oſiander</hi> ſays, That God doth <pb n="399" facs="tcp:0319800400:421"/> not allow,
that Hereticks ſhould be puniſhed with Death, and forbids Magiſtrates to
execute any ſuch Authority: And <hi>Calvin</hi> was of the ſame Opinion,
till he was ſettled in Power at <hi>Geneva.</hi> For before, he was much for
Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience; and of the ſame Judgment was <hi>Melancton</hi> and
many other learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as, <hi>Caſſander, Grotius,</hi> and
many other of the middle Temper. The Cantons of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> agree
well in temperate things; and does not the famous Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi>
tolerate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Religions? and the great Emperor of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>
does the ſame. What Reaſon can be given by indifferent Men, why the Policy
of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be ſo ſingular, and ſo differing from that
of all other Chriſtian Kingdoms and Nations about her? Why ſhould the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Government be more ſevere in this Point, than that of our
Neighbours? It may ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reflect upon the Honour of our
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to mention the <hi>Turk</hi> in this Caſe; yet certainly it cannot
be denied, but that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans live quietly in the <hi>Turk</hi>'s
Dominions, and upon Conditions ſo eaſy, that the Catholicks in
<hi>England</hi> would be well contented with the like, who by the Grace of God
have, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves as loyally in all Points, as not to
attempt any thing offenſive to the State, or prejudicial to the publick
Peace. There is nothing in the Catholick Religion inconſiſtent with
Loyalty; and Catholicks are in Truth better Subjects than Proteſtants have
ſhewed themſelves to be, generally ſpeaking, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0319800400:422"/> their Principles. Can any Man deny, but that there was a
moſt horrid Rebellion carried on by Proteſtants in <hi>England?</hi> And
the Catholicks hope, that having always wiſhed well to his Majeſty's Title,
and prayed for his happy Succeſſion to his Kingdoms, that their ſo long
tried Fidelity will at laſt procure them ſome Liberty and Refreſhment. I
know, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays, they are out of their Wits who deſire to live
under Sovereign Monarchies; and ſays, Order and Policy muſt needs decay,
where one Man holds ſuch an Extent of Government: And Kings, ſays he,
oftentimes forget they are Men, and they are ſtyled <hi>Dei
gratiâ,</hi> for no other Purpoſe, but to ſhew that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no Superior upon Earth, and that they uſually make Choice of ſuch
Counſellours as can beſt fit their Humours, and accommodate themſelves to
their Appetites: So that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Kings nothing the better for having
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, whom he ſtains with an intolerable Scandal. And
<hi>Buchanan</hi> ſays, St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Obedience to Princes, in
the Infancy of the Church; and if he had lived at this Time, he would have
ſaid otherwiſe. But as it is ſaid, <hi>Nullum unquam magnum ingenium
ſine aliqua mixtura inſaniae</hi>; ſo <hi>Buchanan</hi> was a
high-ſoaring Wit, and had ſome Tincture of Phrenzy: For had he been
perfectly ſound, he would never have let ſlip ſuch a <hi>Hyſteron
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teron</hi> as this from his Pen. And <hi>Knox,</hi> in his Hiſtory of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> not only juſtifies what <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſays, but
would be content, that <pb n="401" facs="tcp:0319800400:423"/> there were publick Rewards
appointed for ſuch as murder Tyrants, as there are for ſuch as kill Wolves;
which is a moſt pernicious Doctrine, fit for nothing but to encourage a
<hi>Ravilliac,</hi> or a <hi>Poltrat. Calvin,</hi> who writes in the Quality of
a Divine, in his Inſtitutions, makes a <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> of all Kings,
that he might not come ſhort of his Predeceſſor <hi>Martin
Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs, Princes once diſpoſſeſſed ſeldom
recover their Hold again. There is none will deny, but that it is neceſſary
the Government of all Princes ſhould be regulated by Laws, and that Perſons
in Authority do obſerve thoſe Rules that are preſcribed to them by
thoſe to whom that Power belongs. I pretend not to enhance the Authority of
Princes ſo far, as to exempt them from the Rule of Law, or to make them
arbitrary in their Government: But when it is ſaid, <hi>Vos eſtis Dii,</hi>
they are juſtly eſtabliſhed in the ſupreme Authority; and when <hi>I
have ſaid, Ye are Gods,</hi> ſurely it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded rather to teach the
World a Leſſon of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, than Rebellion; and Kings by thoſe Words
are juſtly eſtabliſhed by divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſame Authority, and
exempted from any popular Cognizance. It's proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for God to ſay,
<hi>Transferam Regna de Gente in Gentem:</hi> The Tranſlating of Kingdoms is
the extraordinary Diſpenſation of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for Reaſons known
to God's ſecret Wiſdom: And tho' this be done by the Hands of Men, yet are
not the common People licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereby to run upon any irregular Deſigns 
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0319800400:424"/> of their own Head, and to take Revenge of their
Governours. St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands every Soul to pay Obedience and Honour
to <hi>Nero,</hi> who was God's Lieutenant upon Earth, and had the Image of God
upon him, that is, God's Authority, and was therefore to be uſed with due
Honour and Reverence. When <hi>Julian,</hi> of a Chriſtian Emperor, became
Apoſtate, and perſecuted the Chriſtians with great Cruelty; tho' the
People ſharply reproved, and inveighed againſt his Proceedings, yet none of
them took up Arms againſt him, to depoſe him of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Life; and if
they thought it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to do ſo againſt a Tyrant, who only acted by
his exorbitant Paſſions, how much leſs would they have thought it lawful
to be done againſt ſuch Princes as govern legally, and do nothing againſt
Religion. We muſt know, that Kings are to be conſidered in a double
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, of Nature, and of Policy: The Body Politick never dies, and ſo is
never defective of Authority. The Acts of the Body Politick are not abated by
the Natural Body's Acceſs; the Body Politick is not diſabled to govern by
the Nonnage of the Natural. So in the 4th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the
Leaſes of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> made by King <hi>Edward</hi> VI.
were reſolved by all the Judges to be good, tho' made in the King's Minority:
For tho' the King's Body Natural cannot judge, yet that diſables not, that
the Acts of his Minority, ordered by his Council or Regent, ſhould be of no
Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. The Parliament certainly would not take <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0319800400:425"/> it
well, if a Catholick ſhould affirm, that the Change of Religion made by King
<hi>Edward</hi> VI. was not warrantable, being done in his Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when he
had not Age to diſcern what he did, being in the Hands of the Protector and
<hi>Northumberland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſe the King breaks his Coronation Oath, may not
many things happen after his Oath taken, to excuſe him from Perjury? By Law,
every Oath, how abſolute ſoever, hath always this neceſſary Condition
annexed tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz. Rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> that things remain as
they were, when the Oath was taken: But if ſuch Alterations, which make
either the Oath or Promiſe impoſſible, or unlawful to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, a
Man doth not then commit Perjury, that breaks his Oath or Promiſe. What, if
that which the King at his Inauguration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for the Good of his People,
cannot be obſerved, without great Damage to them? If the Condition of Affairs
be ſo changed, Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions upon them muſt alſo change. Dr.
<hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> a great Divine, and a great Prelate of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and choſen on Purpoſe by the great Stateſmen of his
Time, to write <hi>Cum Privilegio,</hi> puts the Queſtion, Whether a King
ſhall be depoſed for breaking his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath? And he anſwers in the
Negative, and gives this Reaſon: <hi>The People may not break with their
Prince ſo often as he breaks with God: For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Subjects
cannot depoſe their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whom they muſt be ſubject for
Conſcience ſake</hi>; which Doctrine is quite contrary to what 
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0319800400:426"/> is now taught. And farther, Dr. <hi>Bilſon</hi>
ſays, That <hi>Subjects are forbidden to take Arms againſt their
Princes;</hi> the Reaſon hereof he ſays is invincible: <hi>For to him that
may Kill and War againſt a Prince, Killing him is of Conſequence
inevitable. The Apoſtle,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>obeyed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants that commanded
all things againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and in thoſe things they did ſubmit
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Meekneſs to endure the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's Pleaſure, and not
to obey his Will.</hi> And he concludes, <hi>That if the Laws of the Land
appoint the Nobles, as next the King, to aſſiſt him in doing right, and
to withold him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrong, then they are licenſed by Man's Law to
interpoſe themſelves, but in no Caſe to deprive the Prince where the
Scepter is inherited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt manifeſt, that this Spirit of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hath
ever been, and is moſt dangerous to thoſe Princes and States where it gets
Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was it which begat ſo many Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies againſt Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>: So that more Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been depoſed and perſecuted by
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants their Subjects, upon the Difference of Religion, than have been
by the Practices of any Catholick Subjects in any time before Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, for Six Hundred Years. But we will ſend them to Doctor
<hi>Bilſon,</hi> a great Divine of their own Church, who holds it an Article
of Faith, that Princes were not to be depoſed; which was good Doctrine in the
Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> tho' it was not thought ſo in the Reign of
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who reigned not much above Five Years, and yet had more
Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections <pb n="405" facs="tcp:0319800400:427"/> raiſed againſt her in that ſmall
Time, than Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had from the Catholicks in Forty Five
Years; and yet Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was very merciful, and ſhewed much
Compaſſion to ſuch as deſerved not well of her: To the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Somerſet</hi>; to Sir <hi>John Clarke,</hi> who had been a principal
Corrupter of King <hi>Edward</hi> her Brother's Infancy; to the Lord Chief
Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Montague,</hi> who both counſelled and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to her
Diſinheriting; and to many others who were attainted, that neither affected
her Religion nor Title, and were then Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the <hi>Tower</hi>; and
yet ſhe releaſed them all: And for all this, the Zealots of her Time would
not ſuffer her to enjoy any Quiet, but murmured againſt the Government of
Women, and did conſpire and plot her Deprivation, out of a Deſire to
advance her Succeſſor, under whom they expected a golden Age. And
<hi>Knox</hi> then ſaid, the Nobility, Magiſtrates, and Judges, and the
whole People of <hi>England,</hi> were bound in Conſcience not only to
oppoſe the Proceedings of that <hi>Jezabel, Mary,</hi> but even to have
killed her, and all her Prieſts with her.</p>
               <p>After the Death of this Queen, her Siſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
came to the Crown, and the whole Chriſtian World ſtood amazed at ſuch a
ſudden Alteration; and the rather, becauſe Religion had been ſo lately
and ſo ſolemnly reſtored by Parliament. Alſo, the Queen that now was
had always profeſſed her ſelf a Catholick, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of her
Siſter, and did conſtantly <pb n="406" facs="tcp:0319800400:428"/> hear Maſs, and went
often to Confeſſion; and in open Parliament, after her Intention for a
Change in Religion, began to be diſcovered, ſhe uſed Policy, at leaſt;
for ſhe aſſured the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, that no Trouble ſhould
ariſe to them for any Difference in Religion, which did much abate the
Oppoſition that otherwiſe might probably have been made by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Party, and put the Clergy themſelves in Hopes of ſome fair Quarter under
her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She knew well, that a Prince alone, how ſovereign ſoever,
could not eſtabliſh a new Religion in this Kingdom, without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to give Authority and Countenance to it; and therefore, to win the Biſhops,
and the reſt of the Catholicks in Parliament, to Silence, at leaſt, ſhe
was content to uſe Policy with them, and promiſe them fair; and ſhe
alſo thought good to qualify the Style ſomewhat, from <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Head</hi> changing it into <hi>Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>; which altered not the
Senſe, yet it abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome into a Belief, that the Queen preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not
much in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, as the King her Father had done, who was
<hi>Flagelium Dei,</hi> the Scourge of God to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and the firſt King in our Nation that ever tried the admirable Patience,
Obedience, and Loyalty of his Catholick Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephorus Phocas,</hi> the Emperor, was the neareſt
Parallel to this King that we meet with in all the Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtory; for he reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all Donations that had been made unto
Monaſteries and Churches in his Time; but <pb n="407" facs="tcp:0319800400:429"/> ſuch
Afflictions followed him ever after, that <hi>Baſilius</hi> his Succeſſor
(who was none of the beſt Emperors) was yet careful to abrogate thoſe Laws
of <hi>Phocas</hi> among his firſt Acts, as the Root of all the Calamities of
thoſe Times. Nor did any better Succeſs attend King <hi>Harrie</hi>'s
Impieties. His exorbitant Luſts, which were the Original of all the
Miſchiefs which the Nation ſuffered, became at laſt his Torments. No King
was ever more neceſſitated in Point of Treaſure, in very few Years after
that immenſe Treaſure left him by his royal Father. Never did King lay more
heavy Taxes upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and never any King did uſe more ignoble and
unprincely Ways to raiſe Money; and to ſhew God's great Diſpleaſure
againſt him, he was fruſtrated of that which was pretended to be his
chiefeſt Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> Succeſſion and Iſſue: All his noble
Stems and Branches were taken away, one after the other, without Iſſue, and
his Crown tranſlated to another Name and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God ſuffering him as a
blind Man, to err and wander in all his Courſes; and all the great Treaſure
which he had raked together upon the Ruine of the Church, was all ſpent in
Exceſs and Vanity, and not to any Honour of the Kingdom, nor Eaſe of his
Subjects, or Maintenance of the Borders, or Relief of the Poor (all which were
at firſt mainly pretended) but at laſt all was employed in Tiltings,
Maſks, and Mummeries, and in pleaſing and inviting his Miſtreſſes,
and to ſatisfy the greedy Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of thoſe Sollicitors of his Luſt.
And when <pb n="408" facs="tcp:0319800400:430"/> the King had thus wearied his Subjects with a
long and inglorious Reign, and that he found his Soul as much oppreſſed
with the Guilt of his Sins, as his Body was become unweildy thro' his
exceſſive Intemperance; he died (as ſome ſay) deſirous to repent, and
be reconciled to the Church; but what Effect his Deſires had, is only known
to God: And yet the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks took all patiently, raiſed no Tumults or
Inſurrections, but were Examples of the true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and did
imitate, in ſome Meaſure, their divine Maſter's Meekneſs, and
reſolved rather to undergo God's juſt Puniſhment in the King's great
Injuſtice, than to ſhew themſelves like ſo many <hi>Lutherans</hi> or
<hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and had only the true Chriſtian Arms, of Prayers and
Tears, by Submiſſion to God's Will.</p>
               <p>Kings indeed ought to conſider, that God hath placed them over
his People, as Examples, to give Countenance to their Laws, by their own
ſtrict Obſervation of them; and that as their Subjects are to be protected
by their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo they are to be aſſiſted and ſupported by each
other, the Function of Kings being an Order by it ſelf; and the Rebellion of
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought to be looked upon by all other Kings as an Aſſault upon
their own Sovereignty, and in ſome Degree a Deſign againſt Monarchy it
ſelf, and conſequently to be ſuppreſſed in what Kingdom ſoever it
is, with the like Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as if it were in their own Bowels: And all
foreign Miniſters, who ought to have been highly concerned for the Murder of
K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. <pb n="409" facs="tcp:0319800400:431"/> by his mercileſs Rebels, and to
have vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that royal Blood, did ſcarce murmur at it, but made haſte
to ſend over their Emiſſaries to get a Share in the Spoils of a murdered
Prince: And yet not one of thoſe Monarchs and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which bought all the
coſtly Pictures, and rich Hangings and Furniture, ever reſtored any of
their unlawful Purchaſes to the King after his moſt happy Reſtoration.
'Tis true, the then King of <hi>Spain</hi> expreſſed a very tender Senſe
of our King's Sufferings, and ſaid, it concerned all Kings to join together,
for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſuch an impious Rebellion, and cruel Parricide, whilſt
his own Abmbaſſador, <hi>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</hi> then in
<hi>England,</hi> not only countenanced and joined with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but
bought the greateſt and beſt Part of all the rare Pictures and rich
Moveables, which he ſold in <hi>Spain</hi> at great Rates: And whilſt he
was in <hi>Flanders,</hi> he gave Count <hi>Fuenſaldagna</hi> a falſe
Relation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, aſſuring him that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy would never again be reſtored; and when it
happened, he was laughed at by all. However, it is certain, that whilſt that
great Impoſtor <hi>Cromwell</hi> lived, his Power at Home was nothing
conſiderable to what it was Abroad: For <hi>France, Spain, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and
all the neighbouring Princes feared him to that Degree, that there was nothing
he could have demanded of them that they would have denied him.</p>
               <p>No Man can deny, but that many well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men were ſeduced
by the diſguiſed Deſigns <pb n="410" facs="tcp:0319800400:432"/> of that myſterious Age,
and by thoſe Villains who always had in their Aim to deſtroy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and
unhinge the whole Frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the ſober Party were cozened by
the Artifices of that loathſome Hypocrite, <hi>Cromwell:</hi> Till at laſt
they were inſpired with a Reſolution to redeem themſelves, their
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberties, which were treacherouſly taken from them by Deceit
and Fraud; and to free themſelves from the miſerable Yoke they lay under,
when they plainly ſaw, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Reformation, and Liberty, were only
deceitful Baits to draw in the deluded Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: But ſtill their moſt
hopeful Deſigns not being carried on with that Prudence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution which
was neceſſary, they were always diſcovered, and did rather ſettle and
confirm, than weaken the Rebellion; till that over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Hand of Providence,
which guides and determines the Affairs of the whole World, was moſt
viſibly ſeen in his Majeſty's moſt happy Reſtoration.</p>
               <p>It is no new thing for the worſt of Men to make uſe of the
ſacred Name of Religion, to palliate their abominable Undertakings. The Ruine
of pious Kings and Princes, the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning all Order in the World, the
tragical Tranſactions of the laſt Age, the Convulſions of State, the
Commotions of the People, the many Changes and Overturnings of Governours and
Governments, were the ſad Effects of the pretended Reformation; and all
theſe Miſchiefs were uſher'd in with the Lamb-like, harmleſs 
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0319800400:433"/> Voice of Religion. They came indeed in Sheeps Cloathing,
who inwardly were ravening Wolves. Some Mens Religion inclines them to Faction,
and there is none to dangerous Faction as that which is nouriſhed by the
Corruption of falſe Religion. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Zealots and the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Enthuſiaſts are a plain Example of it; and therefore
when Men make great Pretences, and begin to talk factiouſly, a fair
Opportunity is very like to make them Rebels: And thoſe who have ſeen what
the Event of thoſe Actions were in the Years of 1640 and 1641, when they
ſaw the ſame things acted over again, and even by ſome of the ſame Men,
they might eaſily and certainly expect the ſame Events: And if Men had
ſeriouſly obſerved this, the ſame Men would never have played over the
ſame Game twice in the ſame Age; which obliged the then Lord Chancellor to
take Notice of it in his Speech to both Houſes of Parliament, That he hoped
they would not ſee three Kingdoms quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed twice in one Age, by the
ſame Methods; telling them, when Men were in their Wits, they would not fall
into the ſame Pit, in which they had ſeen others fall before them, when
even Beaſts will not do it, let the Bait be what it will. But, alas! many of
thoſe who were the principal Makers of the firſt, were ſo far from
falling into it, that they were the chiefeſt Diggers of the ſecond Pit, in
which ſo many had fallen: And we were then come to that Paſs, that it was
an unpardonable Crime for any Man to look as if he thought the Cry of
<hi>Popery!</hi> was falſe, <pb n="412" facs="tcp:0319800400:434"/> and made a Property only
(as it then really was) to ſerve ſome Mens Ends and Deſigns.</p>
               <p>It was a great Fault in King <hi>Charles</hi> I. at leaſt, a
great Weakneſs in him, to diveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Power of diſſolving
the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which was a juſt Prerogative belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: And
tho' the Parliament then ſaid, that ſhould not encourage them to do any
thing which otherwiſe was not fit for them to do; yet they ſoon invaded the
publick Liberty, and they who ſaid they had no Mind to be Slaves, were yet
willing to be Tyrants themſelves, and would admit no Rules to govern by but
their own Will; not conſidering the Miſery of <hi>Athens</hi> was at the
higheſt when it was governed by Thirty Tyrants. And therefore the wiſeſt
Courſe of Princes is frequently to ſummon Parliaments, and ſeaſonably
to diſſolve them after their applying Cures to thoſe Diſeaſes they
had diſcovered, whereby they would be of great Eſteem to the Crown, as well
as Veneration with the People, and not let them ſit any longer, leſt they
ſhould fall into Factions, and pretend to find Grievances where there are
none. And if King <hi>Charles</hi> II. had lived ſome Years longer, he had
certainly brought them to that Paſs, and preſerved <hi>England</hi> from
the Diſtractions that have ſince followed; which his Majeſty foreſaw,
and which cauſed him to make thoſe frequent Intervals of Parliaments. And
yet his Majeſty declared unto them, That none of his Predeceſſors ever
had a greater Eſteem for Parliaments, the King believing 
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0319800400:435"/> them to be the vital Part of the Conſtitution of the
Kingdom, and ſo neceſſary for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, that neither Prince
nor People could be happy without them; and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Counſels as
the beſt he could receive, and was as tender of their Privileges, and as
careful to preſerve and protect them, as of his own royal Authority; knowing
that all good Subjects would be jealous of any thing that might infringe or
impair his royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his own Intereſt being entirely bound up with
that of his Subjects. But they ſhould conſider, that Parliament Men ſit
as Subjects, not as Superiors, and that they are called to be the King's
Counſellours, not Dictators, their Summons being only to recommend their
Advice, not to command. They ſhould be wiſe, diſpaſſionate, good
Patriots, to raiſe up thoſe Banks and Fences which were caſt down by
Rebellion, in Hopes that the ſame Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould ſpring up again
from thoſe Roots which it did heretofore, and hath always grown, tho' it was
very hard to redeem our Nation from the Infamy it had undergone, and to
reſtore it to all it had loſt, and to make the King and People as happy as
they ought to be; and there was nothing that the Parliament could propoſe for
the Happineſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in which the King did not contend with them to
compaſs, the King not being only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but deſirous to gratify his
People, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their Religion, Liberties and Properties, by as many
good Laws as the Parliament <pb n="414" facs="tcp:0319800400:436"/> would propoſe. He was
abſolutely determined to do all that in him lay to glad the Hearts of his
People, and gave them many Opportunities of providing for their Good; and it
could not be imputed to his Majeſty, that the Succeſs did not anſwer his
Expectation.</p>
               <p>The particular Cauſes of the King's Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction were
ſuch, that what he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Houſe of Commons to avoid, they
purpoſely fell into; and tho' the King ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed to comply with
any thing that would have been propoſed for Security of the Proteſtant
Religion as by Law eſtabliſhed, that might conſiſt with preſerving
the Succeſſion of the Crown in its due and legal Courſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent:
Yet to all his Majeſty's Offers he met with moſt unſuitable and moſt
unwarrantable Returns. The King would moſt willingly have conſented to any
Expedient by which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion eſtabliſhed might have been
preſerved, and the Monarchy not deſtroyed: But no Expedient would ſerve
thoſe ill-natured Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, but the total
Excluſion of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which his Majeſty had ſo often
declared, was a Point which in Honour, Juſtice and Conſcience, he could not
conſent to. When this Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was firſt ſet on Foot, it was
well ſaid, by a noble Perſon then in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, That the King
might outlive the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and then all they were doing would be
unneceſſary; and why ſhould they, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that which might not be,
attempt to do <pb n="415" facs="tcp:0319800400:437"/> that which they could never juſtify,
either to the King or Country. When the King found they went contrary to the
direct Rules of Law, that he was deceived by them, and that the Follies and
Imprudencies of the prevailing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Houſe of Commons (ſome of
which had given Birth and Growth to the Miſeries of the laſt Age) and were
now pouring in Vinegar inſtead of Oil, into the Wounds of the Nation, and
departed from that Fidelity which they owed the King, and that Zeal which they
ſhould have ſhewed to his Service, and that nothing would ſerve them of
the ſame Leaven with thoſe of 1641, but the total Excluſion of his Royal
Highneſs ſucceeding to the Crown, and had prepared an Act for it, the King
came in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Houſe of Lords, and ſent for the Commons to attend
him, in the Year 1680. The King then ſpake roundly to them, and told them how
unſatisfied he was with their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Proceedings, and deſired to know
ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, how he ſhould be aſſiſted by them, and what they deſired
from him, aſſuring them in the Word of a King, that he would concur to any
thing for the Security of the Proteſtant Religion, as it was eſtabliſhed
by Law, but ſtill upon the ſame Terms he had formerly propoſed to them,
and that he would never do it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>But before the Houſe of Commons went to the Lords, where the
King in his Robes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them, they paſſed thoſe enſuing Votes: That
the only Way for ſuppreſſing of Popery, <pb n="416" facs="tcp:0319800400:438"/> was, that
a Bill ſhould be brought in to baniſh immediately all the conſiderable
Papiſts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> out of the King's Dominions: That ſo long as
the Papiſts had any Hopes of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s ſucceeding to the
Crown, the King's Perſon, the Proteſtant Religion, the Lives, Liberties and
Properties of all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Proteſtant Subjects, were in apparent
Danger to be deſtroyed. They farther voted, That a Bill ſhould be brought
in for an Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of all his Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects, for
the Safety of his Majeſty's Perſon, for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Proteſtant
Religion againſt all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppreſſion whatſoever; and for
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> or any Papiſt, for ſucceeding to the
Crown. They did likewiſe declare, That it was the Opinion, that the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> had been removed from his Offices and Commands, by the
Influence of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>; and that an Addreſs ſhould be made
to the King, to reſtore the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> to his Offices and
Commands; and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved likewiſe (juſt before the King being in his Robes
had ſent for them to the Lords Houſe to prorogue them) that whoſoever
adviſed the King to that Prorogation, which they ſaid was done on Purpoſe
againſt Paſſing the Bill for Excluſion of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
was a Betrayer of the King, the Proteſtant Religion, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
<hi>England,</hi> a Promoter of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and a
Penſioner of <hi>France.</hi> They alſo voted at the ſame time, That it
was the Opinion of the Houſe, that the City of <hi>London</hi> 
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:0319800400:439"/> was burnt by the Papiſts in 1666, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Power. Upon theſe extravagant, inſolent,
and diſloyal Votes, the King forthwith diſſolved the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Now the ſtrangeſt thing was, that thoſe who moſt
pretended in the Houſe of Commons for Reformation, had a bare-fac'd Contempt
and Diſtaſte of all Religion whatſoever, and not ſo much as the Shadow
of Vertue: Men of the moſt licentious Lives, of the moſt ſeared
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, of the moſt profligate Reputation, that had bid Defiance to
all Religion, and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently cultivated Atheiſm and Profaneneſs. It
is indeed enough to move the moſt patient Man upon Earth, to conſider what
Foreheads of Steel and Adamant thoſe impious Wretches had, who were thus
confident to gull and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the People of <hi>England,</hi> by
ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal for Religion and Reformation: But ſuch as rebel under
Pretence of Religion, are moſt dangerous to the Government; they will pretend
to defend the King's Perſon againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that themſelves only
might have the Honour of ſubverting the Government; ſo hard a thing it is
to cure one that is bewitched with the Principles of Rebellion, that after many
Years he ſhall return to his Trade as boldly as if his former Pranks had
never been heard of. Fear of Popery, Arbitrary Government, and evil
Counſellours, in my Memory, ſince the Year 1641, made our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation run mad, coſt an infinite Treaſure, with the
Lives of <pb n="418" facs="tcp:0319800400:440"/> ſome Thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and, in
Concluſion, inſtead of Religion, ſetting up Enthuſiaſm; inſtead of
Liberty, the Nation was enſlaved to a military Power; inſtead of Property,
Plunder, Sacrilege, and Sequeſtration; and they were juſt playing the
ſame Game over again in this King's Time, if by little leſs than a Miracle,
they had not been prevented: And whoſoever throws off his Allegiance to his
Sovereign, he renounces all Duty and Conſcience towards God.</p>
               <p>The King calls a Parliament by his own Writ and Authority
(without which they cannot meet) to give him faithful Counſel about his
moſt weighty Affairs; but he does not reſign up his Intereſt and Freedom:
He never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects himſelf to their abſolute Determination: He always
weighs their Counſels, as coming from a Body entruſted by him; and when he
diſſents from them, he tells them the Reaſons which prevailed with his
Conſcience and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, with that Candor that a Prince ſhould do
towards his Subjects. A King ſhould look upon his Parliament as his great
Council, to whoſe Advice he ſhould always have Regard: But a King ſhould
likewiſe look upon himſelf, as neither deprived of his Underſtanding, nor
diveſted of any Right he had, if there was no Parliament ſitting. The
King's Power is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly very uſeful for his People's Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and
Parliaments ought not to ſet Bounds to their Princes; and wiſe Princes will
never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nor affect more Greatneſs or Prerogative, 
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0319800400:441"/> than what is really for the Good of their Subjects.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, ſince the happy Reſtoration of our King, his
People were given up to too much Joy and Forgetfulneſs of our paſt
Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and there was not ſuch a Return to God for his wonderful
Bleſſings, as was due to the great Giver of them; and when we ſaw ſome
Portion of that innocent royal Blood which was ſpilt, recompenſed upon
ſome of their Heads, who were the wicked Contrivers of that Parricide: When
the Miſeries of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Sufferings of the Royal Family were all
recovered by the unerring Hand of divine Providence, without the Intervention
of any foreign Prince, many of the ſame Men joining in the Settlement of our
diſtracted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had before been active in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their
Country, to ſhew how ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they were of their former Errors and great
Miſcarriages; it then manifeſtly appearing to them, and all others (who
were not wilfully blind) that the Bill of Excluſion was carried on with that
Violence, to facilitate the Dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the King and his Succeſſor, who
had ventured his Blood as frankly both by Sea and Land, in the Good of the
Country, as the meaneſt Subject in it; and had manifeſted his unalterable
Loyalty and Affection to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Subjects, by reducing
<hi>Scotland</hi> to Obedience, whoſe Conduct in that Affair was both wiſe
and proſperous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:0319800400:442"/>Now, when the Nation had ſcarce wiped
their Eyes dry for the Blood of the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Father, they were ready to be
drowned again in Tears for the Murder of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Son, if their
Cruelty had been effected. The Rage of thoſe Rebels in the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had only the Blood of one King for its Gratification; but here the Rebels
intended to have glutted their Thirſt of Blood, by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Two at one
Blow, the King with his Royal Brother: And to give their Inhumanity the
higheſt Aſcent, they were preparing to murder a Prince whoſe auguſt
Majeſty had not only enobled the Nation, and once more reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it from
its loſt Reputation abroad, but made his own Kingdom (as he then had Reaſon
to think) an Ark of Safety at home, when almoſt all other Chriſtian Nations
were deluged in Blood and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Who would have imagined a Deſign ſhould be laid to murder
that King, the Blood of whoſe Royal Father ſtill cried for Vengeance? Who
would imagine, that he who was reſtored almoſt by a Miracle, when the
People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ran chearfully into Obedience, and met his
Majeſty with Duty and Love, and received him with triumphant Hoſanna's,
with many Proteſtations of Sorrow for their former Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and with
many Vows of Loyalty and Obedience? Who would have thought, after ſo many
Promiſes of making him a Glorious King! After ſuch Acts of Indemnity
granted to ſuch Monſters of Rebels! After ſuch Profuſions 
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0319800400:443"/> of royal Bounty to ſuch undeſerving Villains! After
ſo many Profeſſions of the Care they would have for the Preſervation of
his ſacred Life! After ſo many ſpecious Addreſſes of his moſt
Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves? Who, I ſay, would
imagine, that after all this, any Man could be found to conſpire to murder
his ſacred Majeſty? As if all his Condeſcenſions and Favours had been
Injuries to make Repriſals upon his Life; and then reſolved to revenge his
Death upon others, when they were doing it themſelves. In the Bill of
Excluſion, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was to be ſet aſide for the King's
Preſervation; but in this Plot the King was to be murdered for the Duke's
ſake; and both King and Duke being taken in the ſame Dilemma (after the
Preſbyterian Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick) were to be ſacrificed: And had their Conſpiracy
taken Effect, they would ſo far have extenuated the Matter, that Cutting of
Throats would only be called a <hi>Scotch</hi> Way of Trimming, and the
Deſtruction of the King and Duke, to be no more but a perfecting the Work of
entire Reformation: And if this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy had ſucceeded, it would have
put an End to our national Conſtitution, and a Period to the very
Fundamentals of all human Society.</p>
               <p>I know no Deliverances come nearer to thoſe of King
<hi>David,</hi> than thoſe wonderful Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of this King: Firſt from
his Eſcape at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and from ſo many <hi>Sheba's</hi> and
<hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophels,</hi> which God from time to time wrought for him; which
perhaps no Age, no State, no <pb n="422" facs="tcp:0319800400:444"/> Hiſtory can ſhew the
like: But this Conſpiracy was the more terrible, in that <hi>Achitophel</hi>
was in the Head of it, who had corrupted and debauched the counterfeit
<hi>Abſalom. Achitophel!</hi> that falſe and treacherous Villain; that
dextrous Man at Wickedneſs; that cunning crafty Politician, who had been
Preſident of the King's Council, who was eſteemed as an Oracle! That
hardened Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who ſtole away, that he might die in his Bed, when it was
Pity that ſuch an inveterate and adviſing Rebel ſhould have died any
other Way, than by the Hand of Juſtice, which he had certainly done without
an <hi>Ignoramus Jury,</hi> when the higheſt Treaſon was formed by ſuch
working Heads, and conducted by ſuch poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Counſels; for it was not
only countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and abetted by the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the People, but was
really incouraged by ſome of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who had affronted his Majeſty,
by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning, Proteſting, and Caballing, which gave the ſeditious
Faction a full Aſſurance, that they were powerful enough to overturn the
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narcy, their Deſign being to be executed by ſuch deſperate Villains,
that nothing leſs could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, than the Kingdom's inevitable Ruine,
had not the King been miraculouſly preſerved.</p>
               <p>But how ſhameful a thing was it, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Birth and
Quality ſhould condeſcend to be Tools, and to creep in the Duſt, to
humour a baſe, unworthy, diſloyal Faction, taken out of the Dregs of the
People? That they ſhould endeavour to extinguiſh that Light from whence
they derived their own Luſtre, and to ſhine <pb n="423" facs="tcp:0319800400:445"/> only by
the Favour of an inconſtant heady Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and the King's Death (however
it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened) was to be put upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; and thoſe
Rebels had a Perſon ready to take upon him the Government, whoſe
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the next Reign, owning his falſe Title to the Crown,
brought him to end his Life upon a Scaffold, inſtead of a Throne, which he
aimed at; and if he had gained his Point, he had entailed War and Blood to our
unborn Poſterity; againſt which no Caution could certainly be too great,
nor againſt that Diſtemper from which we were ſo miraculouſly
recovered, when there was no Cauſe to fear the Loſs of Religion, Liberty,
and Property; neither did they believe themſelves, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be
afraid of them. The Moderation of a Prince was never more ſhewed than by this
King, who then ſuffered ſo much licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Talk to paſs unpuniſhed;
and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared fewer Grievances in his Time than had ever been before, and
<hi>England</hi> ſeemed never more happy than at this Time: And it was a
ſtrange Ingratitude of thoſe who ſeemed ill at Eaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo
temperate a Government, who were yet ſo numerous in the Houſe of Commons,
that they out-voted the beſt Men in it; which made the King often prorogue
them, which proved fatal to his Succeſſor, tho' this King did all that was
poſſible, to keep his People in Peace whilſt he lived, and to leave them
ſo when he died; which puts me in Mind of a prophetical Saying of this King
to me, ſome Years before his Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:0319800400:446"/>About two Years before the Death of King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. he gave me Leave to come into <hi>England,</hi> and ſent
the <hi>Katherine</hi> Yacht to <hi>Oſtend</hi> for me. Some Days after my
Arrival at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> he commanded me to walk with him to <hi>Hyde
Park;</hi> and as I walked with him (the reſt of the Company keeping at a
good Diſtance) he told me, that I had ſerved him very well at
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and that his Brother had given him a very good Account
of my Carriage towards him there. His Majeſty then told me, that I had
ſerved him as Agent and Reſident for many Years; and tho' he conſtantly
uſed to change his Miniſters, at leaſt their Station, every three Years;
that yet I had ſerved him ſo much to his Satisfaction, that he was
reſolved never to remove me from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> whilſt he lived,
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially during the Wars in <hi>Flanders,</hi> becauſe I had always
given him a very particular Account of them, and that I knew that Country very
well, and the Intereſt of all the great Men in it; and that I was there very
well approved of, and that my Diligence and Activity in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice had been
very conſiderable in thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Times: And, after having aſked
me many Queſtions about the Nobility of thoſe Countries, he ſaid, that
during his Exile abroad, he had ſeen many Countries, of which none pleaſed
him ſo much as that of the <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi> which were the moſt honeſt
and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Race of People that he had met with; and then added, <hi>but I
am weary of travelling, I am reſolved to go abroad no more: But when</hi> 
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:0319800400:447"/> 
                  <hi>I am dead and gone, I know not what my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will
do: I am much afraid, that when he comes to the Crown, he will be obliged to
travel again: And yet I will take Care to leave my Kingdoms to him in Peace,
wiſhing he may long keep them ſo. But this hath all of my Fears, little of
my Hopes, and leſs of my Reaſon; and I am much afraid, that when my Brother
comes to the Crown, he will be obliged again to leave his native Soil.</hi>
This Diſcourſe of the King's I have often remembered with much Grief and
Sorrow, which hath been — true in all its Circumſtances: And certainly
had this King loved Buſineſs as well as he underſtood it, he had been the
greateſt Prince of his Time.</p>
               <p>Some time after my Return to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> in the Year
1684, I received this following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi>

                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:0319800400:448"/>About this time, ſeveral
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers came daily to ſee me from the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Camp then at <hi>Dighnin</hi> near
<hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi>; and ſome of them being very inquiſitive to know
what News I had from <hi>England,</hi> the Time being then very critical, I
ſhewed them my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s Letter to me, which, it ſeems,
had ſuch Influence upon ſome of them, that the next Day, when the Duke of
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> went from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>'s Camp, which he did very frequently, and the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> had given a general Order, that whenever the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> entered the Camp, the whole Army ſhould ſtand to their
Arms. But that Day, when the Duke entered the Camp, ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Scotch</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers did neither ſtand to their Arms, as the Duke
paſſed by them, nor their Companies; of which Neglect the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> took particular Notice, and complained to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of
their Neglect. Whereupon the Prince forthwith ſent for thoſe Officers, and
ſharply reprehended them for not obeying his Orders; who thereupon told the
Prince, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reſident had given them Orders not to do
it. Whereat the Prince was very angry; which being told me by ſome of the
Officers, I went the next Day, with Intention to dine with the Prince, and had
my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s Letter in my Pocket. But when I came to the
Prince's Quarters, being informed that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was there,
I thought not fit to ſtay, <pb n="427" facs="tcp:0319800400:449"/> but dined with one of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Collonels in the Camp; and after Dinner I waited on the
Prince, and was conducted into his Cloſet, where the Prince came preſently,
and after uſual Salutation, his Highneſs aſked me, how I came to give
Orders to the Officers of his Army not to ſtand to their Arms when the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> entered his Camp? I told the Prince, that I never gave
them any Orders: That I had, at their earneſt Requeſt, ſhewed them a
Letter I had newly received from my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>; and that if his
Highneſs pleaſed, I would ſhew it him. Whereupon he deſired to ſee
it; and after reading it privately to himſelf, he preſently told me, if I
had done no more than ſhewed them the Letter, I had done no more than my
Duty, and that it was the Fault of his Officers in not obeying his Commands:
That for the King of <hi>England,</hi> he might do what he pleaſed, in
ſending for his Officers and Soldiers, none of which he would keep againſt
their Wills; but whilſt they ſerved him, he pretended they ſhould do
their Duty, and obey his Commands: And ſo I took my Leave of the Prince,
without going into the other Room, where the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> Mr.
<hi>Bentinck,</hi> and ſeveral General Officers were.</p>
