            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN EASY WAY TO PROLONG LIFE.</head>
            <p>HAVING, in the firſt part of this work, gone through the ſeveral properties of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds of food, and ſhewn how far they agree or diſagree with different conſtitutions, we proceed now, according to our promiſe, in order to complete this treatiſe upon health, to conſider Exerciſe, Reſt, Excretions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for let us ever be ſo obſervant of the former, unleſs we pay a careful attention to theſe, we ſhall not be able to keep ourſelves well. We ſhall treat of them, therefore in their turns, and we will begin with,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0350601000:6"/>
               <head>EXERCISE.</head>
               <p>Now, in the human Syſtem, there is a certain quantity only of living power that can be produced for the health of the body; ſo that if we exhauſt that power, we debilitate or weaken the body. A man, for example, may walk, till he can walk no longer: it is, therefore, neceſſary to know how far Exerciſe is ſalutary; but let us firſt conſider the great benefits procured by it.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe encreaſes the natural heat of the body, and thus excites and dilates the ſpirits, making them far more vigorous and active.</p>
               <p>It empties the ſtomach and promotes the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for the next meal; for, as in ſedentary habits, digeſtion does not quite clear the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, but leaves part of the food, which often clogs and diſturbs it; exerciſe will excite this to paſs away, and the ſtomach being thus diſcharged of thoſe relicts, the appetite ſharpens and craves food very ſtrongly. This naturally ſtrengthens the powers of the ſtomach, and we digeſt our next meal better.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0350601000:7"/>
               <p>It alſo excites an expulſion of excrements, not ſuffering any ſuperfluous matter to lodge in the body.</p>
               <p>It likewiſe opens the pores, and gives a free perſpiration, which too much reſt will ſhut up. Nature has appointed theſe vents, and ſecret ways of evacuation, to cleanſe the habit of the body; which in a little time would be clogged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very foul and impure, by an accumulation of ſuperfluous humours.</p>
               <p>It, in the laſt place, promotes and adds greatly to the nutrition of the body. We find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that active, ſtirring people, have a freſher countenance, a greater flow of ſpirits; nay their fleſh is firmer and their limbs ſtronger, than what is generally met with in perſons that lead a ſedentary, idle and ſluggiſh life; for it is a maxim univerſally known and received, that a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exertion of the original powers, in any one part of the body, tends to ſtrengthen that part. For example, the legs of a dancer ſhall be ſtrong and luſty, when his arms ſhall be weak and ſmall, and the arms of a blackſmith or water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall be muſcular and powerful, while their legs ſhall fall away. The reaſon of this is very evident: exerciſe circulates the blood and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0350601000:8"/>juices, gives them a free paſſage to all parts of the limbs ſo exerciſed, and drives off all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humours, that, without it, would be deſtructive. But,</p>
               <p>Such exerciſe is to be choſen, as ſuits beſt with the nature of each perſon's body, ſome requiring exerciſe of the upper parts moſt, others of the lower parts, and ſome equally of both; but that is generally moſt advantageous, that exerciſes every part, as dancing, fencing, riding, tennis, ringing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, whatever be our exerciſe, thoſe whom good fortune has enabled to take it or not, would do well to attend to the following obſervations.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe ſhould be daily in the morning; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with an empty ſtomach; and, if poſſible, after excremental evacuation; for the heat of the body, opening the veſſels, may otherwiſe draw foul humours into the blood and occaſion very dangerous obſtructions. For this reaſon, it is not ſo well to take any extraordinary exerciſe upon a full ſtomach, or till the inteſtines are clear.<note n="*" place="bottom">Though any great exerciſe after meals is injurious, to walk gently is exceedingly wholeſome, for, b<hi rend="sub">o</hi> this means, our food will deſcend to the bottom of the ſtomach, the natural heat of the body will be encreaſed, and digeſtion will go on the better. Where perſons can retire after meals into the ſweet air, and ſuch delightful places as exhilerate the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, tis right to do it. If the ſtate of the body be ſuch, as that we cannot walk after meals, it will be right to ſtand up, at leaſt, according to the old verſe,
<q>"Poſt paſtum ſtabis, paſſu mollive meabis."</q>That is, ſtand up after meals, or walk gently.</note>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0350601000:9"/>
               <p>Exerciſe ſhould be varied according to your conſtitution and the ſeaſon of the year. Young, ſtrong, robuſt perſons, in cold weather, admit of greater exerciſe; old, weak and thin perſons, in hot weather, of leſs; for the fatter and groſſer the body is, ſo much the more is the natural heat diminiſhed, and exerciſe more neceſſary to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſuperfluous moiſture of the body, which occaſions groſſneſs, and to encreaſe the circulation of the blood. Circulation being naturally briſker in the ſummer, exerciſe is leſs needful, but more ſo in the winter, as the moiſture of the ſeaſon will ſometimes occaſion obſtructions in the lungs and breaſt, which ſtrong and laborious motion will often remove.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe, opening the pores, we ſhould be careful not to uſe it in a damp air, leſt we take in ſome of its noxious qualities, that may do us
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0350601000:10"/>harm; neither ſhould we expoſe the body, after it, leſt we catch cold, but theſe things are ſo well known, that they need not be further explained.</p>
               <p>Another neceſſary caution to be obſerved, is, that exerciſe be not too violent, nor continued longer than it is a pleaſure; but that we deſiſt before we be weary, or ſweat too much.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who from age or infirmities are unable to take exerciſe, ſhould rub their bodies, morning and evening, with flannel or coarſe linen gloves. All parts may be rubbed, except the ſtomach and belly; rubbing theſe will diſturb digeſtion and offend the head. We may apply a warm cloth to them in the room of it. The loins of the back likewiſe ſhould not be rubbed, unleſs we feel them cold, and then but gently, leſt they ſhould be over-heated and obſtructions in the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paſſages ſhould enſue. In this operation we ſhould begin ſoftly and eaſily, encreaſing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and weight of our hand, as the tenderneſs of the ſkin will permit, till the fleſh, as it were, ſwell and be ſomewhat ruddy, and then deſiſt; for too much rubbing will bring on an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Was every perſon, well or ill, to rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this manner, once or twice a day, for a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0350601000:11"/>little while, they would never omit it; for they would find themſelves glow with a natural warmth, their limbs would be active and their joints ſupple. It is for this reaſon, that children are rubbed, who can take no exerciſe; and experience teaches us, that the currying and rubbing a horſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his exerciſe, is a great addition to his health. In cold and moiſt ſeaſons the head alſo ſhould be rubbed with a coarſe linen cloth, warmed.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſet out the times for exerciſe and motion, let us proceed to conſider</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>REST.</head>
               <p>Reſt is as neceſſary to preſerve health, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue us in ſtrength and vigour, as exerciſe. When the body is fatigued, reſt is refreſhing, and renews its ſtrength; but when ſatiated with reſt it thirſts again for motion and agreeable exerciſe. Reſt is a burden, if forced upon nature longer than it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. <hi>Interdum quies, inquieta eſt,</hi> ſays Seneca, even reſt ſometimes is irkſome. For if exerciſe is neceſſary for the preſervation of health, too much inactivity muſt be prejudicial. <hi>Ignavia corpus hebetat, labor firmat.</hi> Sluggiſhneſs makes the mind and body dull and heavy, whereas frequent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrengthens and invigorates them.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0350601000:12"/>
               <p>The life of man, converſant in change, ſpends its whole courſe in ſleep and watching; the one appointed for reſt and eaſe, the other for action and labour. If he was conſtant in the firſt, his life would be only the ſhadow of death; if in the laſt, he would ſoon be exhauſted. Nature therefore hath wiſely contrived, that man ſhould not long continue in either, but wear out his life between the two.</p>
               <p>Sleep is a placid ſtate of body and mind, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhment and eaſe to both; for as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of the faculties either of mind or body exhauſts our powers, reſt will reſtore thoſe powers. The powers of the mind are like a ſmall current, which is ſufficient to keep up a continual motion. If we want to give this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greater power, we dam it up, and when the water is run from the dam, if we wiſh to produce a freſh power, equal to the firſt, we ſhut the ſluices, and collect the water again: ſo it is with the mind, in ſleep. In perfect ſleep, both the body and mind are at reſt, excepting in thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, where an exertion is neceſſary to life; and in ſleep, it is that the body receives a greater degree of nutrition; it is then digeſtion takes place in an extraordinary degree, and recruits
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0350601000:13"/>thoſe ſpirits that were exhauſted in the courſe of the preceding day.</p>
               <p>Now that ſleep may prove advantageous, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the intentions and deſigns of nature; let us conſider four things concerning it. The time when it ſhould be taken; the neceſſary limits, or quantity of ſleep required; the ſalubrity of the place, and the poſition of the body.</p>
               <p>The time moſt proper for ſleep, is, according to the appointment of nature, the night, when creation, in general, take its reſt. At the ſhutting up of the day, when the ſun gets below the horizon; the ſpirits are not ſo active and lively, but incline to a ceſſation. Tis then they return to the centre of the body and apply themſelves to what is called concoction; that is they return to perform their vital operations, to nouriſh and refreſh the ſyſtem. For during the heat of the day, they are dilated and extended to the external or circumferent parts. Hence, we find, that, towards midnight, unleſs we are in exerciſe, put on another garment, or encreaſe the heat of the room, we always find ourſelves chilly. In the morning again, at the riſing of the ſun, our ſpirits are naturally freſh, briſk and active. If we therefore, prevert the order of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0350601000:14"/>nature, turn day into night, by keeping late hours, and laying in bed, all the morning, we do that which is greatly deſtructive to our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as ſleep naturally draws the animal heat inwards, and the heat of the ſun counteracts this power, by drawing it outwards; ſleeping in the day is a reſiſting of nature, which muſt be prejudicial to the health of the body. Sleeping in the day, therefore, is a bad cuſtom, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for fat, corpulent people; but if the ſpirits be fatigued with care or buſineſs, or by reaſon of old age, weakneſs of nature, extreme hot weather, labour, or the like; then mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate day-ſleep is a good refreſhment, but take it rather ſitting than lying down, becauſe the head will be leſs offended with the riſing vapours. Neither ſhould it be taken immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after dinner, but an hour or half an hour after, at leaſt; and between dinner and our nap, it would be prudent to walk a little. Thus will our food deſcend better into the ſtomach and be leſs liable to affect the head. Neither ſhould this afternoon's nap be longer than half an hour, or an hour at moſt, leſt the animal heat ſhould be ſo collected from the outward parts, as to cauſe a heavineſs in the head: neither ſhould it be taken in a hot place, but in one cool rather, eſpecially in ſummer time, as ſhall hereafter be ſhewn.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0350601000:15"/>
               <p>Sitting up late is one of the great deſtroyers of the conſtitution; it tires and waſtes the animal ſpirits, by keeping them too long upon duty; weakens nature, haſtens on the effects of old age, changes a freſh, florid countenance into a ſallow one; heats and dries the body, breeds rheums and bad humours and is particularly injurious to thin people.</p>
               <p>By going early <hi>to</hi> aſleep and early <hi>from</hi> it, we riſe refreſhed, lively and active. Sleeping late in the morning, keeps that excrementitious matter in the inteſtines which ought to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated and thus occaſions obſtructions and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vapours, which greatly offend the head, dull the ſenſes and are very pernicious to the whole body. If our neceſſities indeed oblige us to ſit up late, our ſupper ſhould be little, and we may make amends for it by laying an hour or two longer in the morning; but let what will happen, we ſhould always be up by nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>In order that ſleep may be peaceable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, we ſhould be careful to go to bed with a free and quiet mind, and baniſh the thoughts of all manner of care and buſineſs. How often has a train of thinking diſturbed a man's reſt, and kept him awake the whole night! The body
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0350601000:16"/>and the mind is recruited in proportion to the ſoundneſs alſo of ſleep. The more we dream the leſs are we refreſhed. Although reſt is not complete at the beginning, it has a tendency to become ſo, during this ſtate of the body; that is to a quiet mind, ſleep becomes ſounder and ſounder. When a man firſt falls a-ſleep, he dreams, toſſes and tumbles about; gradually he becomes more quiet, and were we awake him, he would not recollect that he had been dreaming at all, or he would tell us, he dreamed, but in a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. During ſleep the original power appears to be ſo much accumulated, as to give a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to action, both to the mind and body, from the ſlighteſt cauſe; ſleep then leaves us and we awake: that is, when the powers are recruited, the organs begin to be affected, and the man dreams afreſh; at laſt, outward objects ſenſibly affect him and he awakes. 'Tis then the mind is fitteſt for action; the judgment is then ſtronger, the imagination more lively and as the evening comes on, theſe powers are gradually diminiſhed, and require freſh ſleep to recruit them.</p>
               <p>The next thing that falls under our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the quantity of ſleep we take. This has been in ſome meaſure noticed; but it may not be unneceſſary to be a little more particular. It
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0350601000:17"/>cannot indeed be determined how long we may ſleep; as in all other things, a mediocrity is beſt. Our ſleep ſhould be proportioned to our health, our age, the complexion and emptineſs or fulneſs of the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>As the nutrition of the body is particularly aſſiſted by ſleep, we ſhould ſleep, in general, till the food we take has performed its office; that is, till what phyſicians call concoction is completed. This may be diſcerned on our awaking by the ſenſible lightneſs of the body, eſpecially the head; the emptineſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and a certain deſire of evacuation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it is not unnaturally occaſioned. Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the head and eyes, or a taſte of our laſt meal, ſignify that we have not ſlept a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient length of time. In ſhort, ſix, ſeven or eight hours is long enough for young perſons in health, but ſuch as are ſickly and weak require longer reſt, nine, ten or eleven hours. Children and old men require more ſleep, in general, than young or middle-aged perſons; children, that their growth may the better be promoted, and old men, becauſe it leſſens the dryneſs of their conſtitution. The ſame reaſon holds good with lean people, to whom more ſleep is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary than to ſuch as are fat; for ſleep moiſtens
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0350601000:18"/>and refreſhes the whole ſyſtem. In a word, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſleep, or ſleep taken at improper times weakens the natural heat, loads the head with vapours, detains the excrements longer than is wholeſome, makes men ſluggiſh and heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, deſtroys the memory and ſubjects them to the palſy, lethargy, &amp;c. ſo too little ſleep dries up the conſtitution, dims the ſight, waſtes the ſpirits and deſtroys all the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both of mind and body. It muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that we ſhould not go to bed upon a full ſtomach; that is, not go to reſt too ſoon after ſupper; but continue up an hour or two, till our food be half digeſted; if we are obliged to ſup late, we ſhould eat the leſs: for, on account of the natural heat of the body retiring inwards during the time of ſleep, a full ſtomach will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a ſuperfluity of vapours, and greatly offend the head. Beſides, great ſuppers are very apt to occaſion heart-burn, which will of courſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of our reſt.</p>
               <p>A matter occurs here; whether it be beneficial or not to have our bed warmed? Perſons in years, ſuch as are weak and thoſe who lead a tender and delicate courſe of life, do right to warm their beds, in cold and moiſt ſeaſons of the year; and that for two reaſons; that the body, on putting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0350601000:19"/>off our cloaths, may not be ſuddenly affected with the external cold; and as the inward heat of the body is much aſſiſted by the warmth of the bed, concoction will be forwarded and the ſuperfluous moiſture of the body be the better conſumed. But this cuſtom is unwholeſome to thoſe perſons who are healthful and ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will very much weaken them.</p>
               <p>When we ariſe in the morning we ſhould find it amply compenſate for our trouble, were we gently to rub our breaſts and ſides downward with our hands, and the reſt of our body more ſtrongly with flannel or a hot linnen cloth, particularly our joints. Doing this will quicken the blood, ſtrengthen the parts and excite the natural heat. When riſen, we ſhould ſtretch ourſelves out, that the animal ſpirits may be dilated to the exterior parts of the body, walk a little up and down, that the remaining contents of the ſtomach may more ſpeedily deſcend; this done, we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to cleanſe our noſe, by blowing it; to clear our breaſt, by expectoration, and to make every other neceſſary evacuation. We ſhould waſh and and plunge our eyes in cold water, for this not only clears away the filth, but ſtrengthens and preſerves the ſight. The mouth ſhould be well cleanſed with the ſame, and the teeth rubbed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0350601000:20"/>with a dry coarſe cloth, after firſt ſcouring them with a ſage leaf, dipped in vinegar. This will purify the breath, and preſerve the teeth from foulneſs and decay: and laſt of all the head ſhould be combed, that the pores may be opened to expel ſuch vapours, as were not conſumed by ſleep.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be mentioned is the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety of the place we ſleep in. A high room, dry, ſweet and well-aired, free from ſmoke and remote from noiſe, is the moſt wholeſome: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould our chamber be hot, for the ſpirits and natural heat of the body, which is drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by ſleep, as before-mentioned, will be counteracted by any extraordinary heat in the room; but it ſhould be moderately warm, and free from damps, either natural or artificial, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from new plaiſtered walls, waſhing the floor or otherwiſe. It may not be amiſs here to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the danger of ſleeping in the open air or on the ground, as many in the ſummer ſeaſon do. Thoſe whoſe ſtations in life oblige them to it, as ſoldiers, though for the preſent they eſcape the miſchief, are frequently afterwards made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the injury, by aches, ſtiffneſs or weakneſs of limbs, and many other infirmities that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from it.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0350601000:21"/>
               <p>Our beds may be ſoft, but ſhould not ſink in, as that will ſuck from the body, exhauſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our ſtrength. A mattraſs upon a feather-bed is both eaſy and wholeſome. As bedding receives the vapours, and ſweaty moiſture of the body, we ſhould be careful that it is always clean, ſweet and well-aired; for if it is not purified by air or fire, it will contract an ill ſcent and become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome. If every one ought to be thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the beds they conſtantly lie in themſelves, we may ſee how neceſſary it is that travellers ſhould be cautious how and where they ſleep. No bed-chamber ſhould be waſhed in cold, wet or foggy weather; ſweeping and bruſhing is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keep it decent, and airing it in clear, dry days, by opening the windows, will prevent its becoming offenſive.</p>
               <p>As to the nature of our covering at night, it ſhould be according to the ſeaſon of the year. The head ſhould be covered ſufficiently to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its taking cold, but not too warm, leſt it weaken it and haſten grey hairs; for if the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours iſſuing from the brain are impeded in their paſſage, it will cauſe the hair to turn grey, much ſooner than it otherwiſe would.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to our manner of laying; we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0350601000:22"/>may in a great meaſure conſult our own eaſe. The head ſhould be higher than any other part of the body; the bed from head to feet, ſhould be ſmooth and even, without any fall below the pillow, or hollow under the ſhoulders. Sleeping generally on the back is unwholeſome, as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the head naturally fall by this means into the hinder part of the brain and may diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and the loins are thus more heated than they would otherwiſe be, and of courſe the urinary paſſages more ſubject to obſtructions. Perſons afflicted with the ſtone ſhould by no means ſleep on their backs. Sleeping with the back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may be occaſionally good for ſuch perſons as are troubled with wind and have a weak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, the bowels being thus kept ſo much the warmer; but to thoſe who have weak eyes it is pernicious, as a defluxion of humours may thus fall into them. The moſt wholeſome method of ſleeping, is on the ſide, firſt on the left ſide, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who go to bed before they have digeſted their ſupper, as the food will in this caſe better deſcend to the bottom of the ſtomach; and then on the right, that the motion of the heart may be freeſt from preſſure. But the principal thing to render ſleep comfortable, is, as was hinted before, to compoſe the mind. If we lie down with roving, troubled thoughts, they will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0350601000:23"/>commonly calls us up, before it is fit to riſe, and our ſleep will not be piacid or refreſhing. When we lay by our cloaths, therefore, let us not lay aſide our buſineſs, care and thoughts, and let not a wandering fancy break our reſt.</p>
               <p>It has been often doubted, whether it be good to ſleep with the mouth a little open. Some there are, that altogether deny it; but to ſleep with the mouth open is certainly beneficial, and that, for theſe three reaſons: becauſe the breath paſſes more freely and the fuliginous fumes are better ſent forth than diſcuſſed. Hence it is that ſuch as ſleep with the mouth open, have a ſweet breath, whereas thoſe that ſleep with it ſhut, have generally an offenſive breath and foul teeth. The ſecond is, becauſe ſome bad moiſture may in ſleep paſs forth at the mouth, which if ſhut, would fall upon the lungs and be prejudicial. The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe owing to the deſcent of rheumes from the head, the free paſſage of the breath through the noſe may be impeded, and ſnorings, and offenſive routings enſue, that may diſturb us of our reſt, and awaken us.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the tongue, palate and gums of ſuch as ſleep with their mouth open, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly afterwards very dry and covered with ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0350601000:24"/>matter, though in fact, thoſe who ſleep with their mouth ſhut are moſt ſubject to it, all perſons in the morning, ſhould waſh their mouths and teeth well and gargle their throats, and then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconvenience is removed.</p>
               <p>The only thing further to be enquired into, upon this ſubject, is whether ſweating at night be deſtructive to the conſtitution or not. Great ſweats are undoubtedly weakening, but light ſweats are a great benefit, for groſs humours are thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, wind is diſcuſſed, the blood is purified, the ſpirits are refreſhed, the cramp, palſy, gout, ſwelling of the joints and other parts, achs, numbneſs and heavineſs of the limbs are prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſequently the whole body better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, lively, and in health. But, this caution muſt be obſerved, and the body be not ſuddenly after it expoſed to the cold air. We will proceed now to.</p>

               <head>EXCRETIONS or EVACUATIONS.</head>
               <p>All that the ſtomach receives is not fit to be retained; our food, though ſtudiouſly choſen and temperately uſed, is not all converted into the ſubſtance of the body; but ſome part of it is,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0350601000:25"/>to be ſeparated and ſent forth; the reſt is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and nouriſh. This regular courſe being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, the body thrives and is in good order; but if that which ſhould be evacuated, be retained, or that which ought to be retained, be injurioſly paſſed off, the regular oeconomy is ſubverted and the conſtitution ſuffers and decays.</p>
               <p>The general excretions of the body are the ſtool or <hi>faeces</hi> and the urine, and for eaſe and health they ought to be daily evacuated. If our habit be naturally lax, it is a happineſs, provided that laxity be not immoderate; for ſuch perſons as are continually coſtive, and have ſeldom the benefit of nature, in the reſpect we are now talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, are liable to many diſorders.

               <p>THE neceſſity and uſe of drink is to preſerve natural moiſture, and to make good a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſtribution of meat, that it may digeſt the better. For theſe reaſons it ſhould be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken at meals. Sundry little draughts are more wholeſome than two or three large ones. Large draughts at meals makes the food fluctuate in the ſtomach. This with its weakening and relaxing the coats of the ſtomach, deſtroys di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. Great draughts alſo leſſen the natural heat of the ſtomach, drives the food down too haſtily, and corrups the whole body with too great moiſture and crudity.</p>

               <p>It will not be improper to mention here, that ſuch perſons as accuſtom themſelves to taking ſoup the firſt thing at a meal, would do well to take it as hot as they can, as the heat will be very comfortable to the ſtomach. Taken luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm it would ſoon prove nauſeous, though never ſo good. The drinking cold beer after hot ſoup or broth is an abſurd and hurtful cuſtom, for it counteracts the heat of the ſoup, deſtroys the tone of the ſtomach, and does miſchief.</p>

But after the food is paſſed off from the ſtomach, that is, three or four hours after the meal, a few glaſſes of wine, to a perſon in years, or of a cold conſtitution is beneficial; as it will cleanſe the ſtomach of the relicks of the food, and create a readier diſtribution of the nutritive part of it, to the different parts of the body.</p>

               <head>Some obſervations upon drunkenneſs.</head>
               <p>IT is a maxim eſtabliſhed upon good reaſon, that <hi>every thing exceeding its juſt bounds, is hurtful to nature.</hi> The beſt of things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in this general rule. Even the neceſſary <hi>ſupports</hi> of life, if not qualified and made whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome by this corrective, may prove the <hi>procurers</hi> of death.</p>
               <p>Drink, when carried to exceſs, is no longer a refreſhment, to moiſten or water the thirſty bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; nor a preſervative; but becomes an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to drown and ſuffocate the vital powers, and is the cauſe of ſickneſs. It puts a man out of a ſtate of health, and diſorders him ſo much, that we may conſider him as going to die.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid by ſome ancient phyſicians, that to be drunk, once a month, is good phyſic and wholeſome, as by overcharging the ſtomach it provokes vomiting and ſo carries off what may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0350601000:33"/>be there lodged, that would otherwiſe breed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but this a poor plea for drunkenneſs; that for the gaining one ſuppoſed benefit, (which might be obtained by other means) we ſhould run the riſk of bringing on twenty diſorders.</p>
               <p>Drunkenneſs is certainly a diſeaſe, for it has all the requiſites to conſtitute a diſeaſe, and is far diſtant from a ſtate of health. For if health be the free and regular diſcharge of the functions of the body and mind, and ſickneſs a weak and imperfect diſcharge of thoſe functions; then ebriety may properly be ſaid to be a diſeaſe or ſickneſs; it having the ſymptoms of an acute diſeaſe; for, during the time of drunkenneſs and ſome time after, few of the faculties perform their office righly.</p>
               <p>If we examine the intellectual faculties, we ſhall find the reaſon gone, the memory loſt or bewildered, and the will ſtrangely perverted.</p>
               <p>If we look into the ſenſitive faculties they are alſo diſordered; their functions impeded, or very defectively performed. The eyes do not ſee well, the ears hear well, nor the palate reliſh, &amp;c. The ſpeech falters and is imperfect; the ſtomach throws up its contents, or nauſeates;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0350601000:34"/>the legs fail, and the whole man is out of order.</p>
               <p>Now, according to theſe ſymptoms in other diſeaſes, we ſhould judge the patient not likely to live, or we ſhould deem his recovery very difficult. Surely then drunkenneſs, for the time it laſts, muſt be a very great diſeaſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does not in general prove mortal, or continue long, it is thought little or nothing of, and is conſidered as a trival matter, that will cure itſelf.</p>
               <p>But it may be aſked, why drunkenneſs is not uſually mortal, ſince the ſame ſymptoms in other diſeaſes would be accounted ſo?</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer; all the hopes we have that a drunken man ſhould live; is firſt, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience ſhews that drunkenneſs is not mortal; ſecondly, from the nature of the cauſe, (ſtrong drink) which though it rage and ſtrangely diſcompoſe the man for a time, yet it laſts not long, nor is it commonly mortal. The inebriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits of the liquor, flowing in ſo faſt and joining with the natural ſpirits of the man, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a tide, ſo high as to overflow all the banks and bounds of order; but theſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0350601000:35"/>ſpirits are ſo amicable and friendly to our bodies, in their own nature, as not to be equally deadly injurious, with that which is not ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar. Beſides, their being ſo very volatile, light, and active nature, much ſooner recovers herſelf, than if the morbific matter were more ſolid, ponderous, and fixed. And, further,</p>
               <p>Thoſe bad ſymptoms in other diſeaſes are more to be feared, becauſe they depend, perhaps, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on malignant cauſes; ſuch as, by time, may be rooted in the conſtitution, or from the defection of ſome principal part; but the ſtorm ariſing from drunkenneſs, as it is ſuddenly raiſed, ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſoon abates.</p>
               <p>But though drunkenneſs be not mortal, nor the danger, perhaps, great for the preſent; yet drunken bouts frequently repeated, their relicts will accumulate, weaken nature, and lay the foundation of many chronic diſeaſes. Nor can it be expected otherwiſe; ſo that we may juſtly conclude, from the manifeſt irregular actions which appear to us externally, that the internal functions and their motions are ſtrangely diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: for outward madneſs proceeds from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impulſes and diſordered motions of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; which general diſturbance muſt of courſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0350601000:36"/>overturn the oeconomy of nature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ruin the whole ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>The ill effects ariſing from intoxication, are a changing of the natural tone of the ſtomach, a deſtruction of its digeſtive powers, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the nutritive part of our food. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience tells us, that, after a drunken debauch, the ſtomach loſes its appetite, and readineſs of digeſtion, and, of courſe, nauſea, belching, and thirſt enſue.</p>
               <p>Great drinkers generally acquire an unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome corpulency of body, or a lean confumptive conſtitution; few of them eſcape. So great a dependance is there upon the ſtomach, that other parts cannot perform their duty, if this leading principal part be perverted and debauched.</p>
               <p>Now that different habits of body ſhould ariſe from the ſame cauſe, is owing to the different diſpoſition of parts: for in ſome perſons, although the ſtomach be vitiated, yet the ſtrength of the ſubſequent digeſtions is ſo great, from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of thoſe parts deſtined to ſuch offices, that they act ſtrenouſly, though the matter on which they act be tranſmitted to them imperfect and degenerate, and do therefore keep the body
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0350601000:37"/>plump and full, although the juices be foul and of a depraved nature.</p>
               <p>Others, on the contrary; whoſe parts are not ſo ſtrong, loſe the benefit of nutrition, and fall away. Hence it is that by exceſſive drinking one man ſhall puff up, fill, and grow dropſical; while another pines away, and becomes conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>A third injury, and a common one ariſing from intemperate drinking, is a weakneſs of the nerves, brought on by diſorderly motions of the animal ſpirits. Thus we ſee the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and miſchiefs attendant upon intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>Drinking together is the pledge of friendſhip, and to be made drunk is the characteriſtic of a generous and hearty entertainment: for, moſt commonly, drinking concludes the feaſt. When nature has been tempted with varieties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps overcharged with them; the next folly is to diſturb and inebriate the ſpirits, vitiate the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and precipitate the food out of the ſtomach by a flood of liquor, before digeſtion be finiſhed; that if you have eſcaped a ſurfeit by eating, you ſhall not go away without a miſchief
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0350601000:38"/>by drinking; thus your good dinner is ſpoiled, and inſtead of being benefited by it, you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and your friends civility becomes your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>But to the neceſſary uſes of drink appointed by nature, we have invented others, and made it ſerve for pleaſure, for profit, for wantonneſs, and debauchery. So that drink, which ſhould help to ſupport, nouriſh, and maintain the ſtrength and vigour of nature, is made an unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to abuſe and injure the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>However, as of drinking and drunkenneſs we have enumerated the evils, let us not be ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as to ſmother the benefits.</p>
               <p>Drinking advances the revenue of exciſe and cuſtom. Makes barley bear a good price, and helps the farmer to pay his rent. It keeps the phyſician and apothecary in employ, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs adds conſiderably to their buſineſs; and is the ſupport of many a publican. But whether drinking ought to be promoted, to forward theſe advantages, with the deſtruction of health, the ſhortening of life, and the debauchery of the people: we leave the reader to judge.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE SMOAKING of TOBACCO.</head>
               <p>TOBACCO is an herb of great antiquity and reputation among the Indians of America. It is alſo called <hi>Nicotian;</hi> but the name, Tobacco, was given it by the Spaniards, from an iſland on which it plentifully grew, and that of Nicotian, by the French, from one Nicot who firſt made them acquainted with it. The Indians call it <hi>Petun</hi> or <hi>Petum,</hi> which is indeed the beſt general name to give it, deriving it from the Latin word <hi>Peto,</hi> it being far fetched and much ſought after.</p>
               <p>It is an herb, hot and dry in its nature, and, we believe of a deſtructive or venomous quality, for being taken any way into the body, it cauſes ſuch a diſturbance as to occaſion violent vomiting and purging, ſtupefying the ſenſes and benumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every part. Theſe effects do not proceed from the temperature of the herb, but from the very eſſence of it. Common experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0350601000:40"/>us of its ſtupefying quality; for ſmoaking to ſuch as are not uſed to it, will bring on a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-like lightneſs of the head and, if perſiſted in for any length of time, will occaſion a ſleepineſs of the whole ſyſtem. Now as the benumbing effect of a plant generally ariſes from the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its quality, and as Tobacco is of a hot nature, it is evident that its ſleepy quality is not owing to its temperature but its very ſubſtance. However, there is in the juice of this herb a cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and healing property, and it is very effectual in the cure of any freſh wound, or old ſore.</p>
               <p>If it be objected by thoſe who accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſmoke or chew tobacco, that they find none of theſe injurious qualities I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, let it be conſidered, that it is owing to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, for by a conſtant uſe of it, they in time ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves inſenſible to its effects, in the ſame manner as the Turks do, with reſpect to their chewing opium.</p>
               <p>The Indians, from whom we learned the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſmoaking, accuſtomed themſelves to uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, only when they were much fatigued with labour or exerciſe, or when the wiſhed to foretell things to come. For the ſmoke's lulling them to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0350601000:41"/>ſleep and creating ſundry dreams; on their awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they found themſelves refreſhed, and from their wandering thoughts during their inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they fondly conceived, they could progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate the event of any buſineſs they took in hand or any matter of importance they wiſhed to know.</p>
               <p>Their method of uſing it was this. Having dried the leaves, they caſt them on the coals, and with a cane received the ſmoke of them by the mouth and noſtrills till they fell into a drunken trance or ſleep, in which they continued three or four hours, according to the quantity of ſmoke they had taken in. After which they found themſelves lightened and refreſhed, and were able to return to their labour or exerciſe as before.</p>
               <p>But we ſmoke tobacco for no ſuch purpoſe; where one perſon takes a pipe medicinally, a hundred do it for pleaſure to paſs away the time. And as this is done indiſcriminately at all times and by all ages and conſtitutions, very often to the injury of health, a few obſervations upon this ſubject, can be no leſs profitable than pleaſing.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0350601000:42"/>
               <p>Notwithanding there is ſomething injurious in the nature of tobacco, and it leaves a diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſmell and ſavour behind it; yet it is beneficial to ſuch perſons as are of a cold, moiſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and troubled with rheums, eſpecially in cold, damp weather, and when uſed moderately; for it will expel wind, diſſolve and diſſipate cold humours, raiſe the ſpirits, eaſe pains in the teeth, ſwellings of the gums and aches of the joints; and if the ſmoke be ſwallowed, it will ſpeedily cure a ſurfeit, by cauſing a ſudden evacuation both upwards and downwards. But to ſuch as are not of a cold and moiſt conſtitution, nor affected with rheums, tho' it be only taken in at the mouth and immediately ejected, it is unwholeſome, as its heat will greatly affect the brain and diſturb the animal ſpirits. As to ſwallowing the ſmoke, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs medicinally, or by way of phyſic, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pernicious both to the ſtomach and the lungs, for it diſturbs digeſtion and tends to dry up the ſoft and ſpungy ſubſtance of the lungs. If any one therefore has habituated himſelf to this idle practice, let him inſtantly leave it off, for though he may find no great inconveniencies ariſing from it, while he is young and ſtrong, yet he may be aſſured, when it is too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the injury, he will diſcover that it has ruined his conſtitution.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0350601000:43"/>
               <p>There are two or three cautions to be obſerved by thoſe who accuſtom themſelves to ſmoaking, which ſhall conclude the whole; one is, that in drawing the ſmoke, they take care that they ſuck it not ſuddenly into their throat or windpipe, as in ſuch caſe it will much offend and diſturb both the lungs and the mouh of the ſtomach. Another caution is in returning the ſmoke from the mouth, to take care it does not outwardly affect the eyes, for it will do them a great deal of injury. A third caution, not to go abroad into the air for half an hour after they quit their pipe, eſpecially if the ſeaſon be cold or damp, for the tobacco will open the pores of the head, and the ſudden acceſs of the cold air may do a great deal of miſchief. Hence we may ſee how idle and fooliſh ſuch perſons act, who walk or travel with a pipe in their mouths. In the laſt place, ſuch as are of a dry, lean conſtitution, ſhould ſhun the uſe of tobacco totally, for its dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature muſt be deſtructive to ſuch habits.</p>
