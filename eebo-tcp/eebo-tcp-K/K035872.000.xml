            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS the whole Nation are happy in the Things You Do, ſo they are particularly Attentive to what You Say. The Speeches your Majeſty is pleas'd to make in Parliament, are look'd upon as Words ſpoken to all the Kingdom, and their Influences are accordingly Univerſal.</p>
            <p>Of all the Expreſſions that ever paſs'd from Your Royal Lips, I humbly preſume, none ever ſounded in the Ears of Your Proteſtant Subjects with ſo General Applauſe, as Your Royal Invitation to <hi>Peace and Union among themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Majeſty has, by this one Step, let all the World know, that You not only Seek, but <hi>perfectly underſtand,</hi> the General Good of your People, and the Only way to make them Invincible.</p>
            <p>It remains to your Subjects, to Accept your Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and look upon it as the moſt binding Obligation, ſince when Princes ſtoop to Invite their People to what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Duty, it carries with it the double Force of a Command.</p>
            <p>Your Subjects, Madam, who wiſh for Peace, are Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd to ſeek and purſue it, while they are now ſatisfied, that ſo long as they follow the Natural Dictates of their own Reaſon, they alſo Concur with the Judgment, and obey the obliging Commands of their Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Thoſe unhappy People, who either from the Severity of their Principles; or really <hi>for want of Principles,</hi> are <hi rend="blackletterType">Otherwise Cnclin'd,</hi> that are for Suppreſſing their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Brethren for Opinions in Religion, or for Oppreſſing their Neighbours for Intereſt and Parties, may now be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
<pb facs="tcp:0540600100:5"/>
that while they purſue that Unchriſtian and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick Method, they not only weaken, but diſoblige your Majeſty, and Your real Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And by this your Majeſty will plainly ſee who are Your beſt Subjects, thoſe who willingly embrace the Peace, and General Charity of Chriſtians and <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men, according to your Majeſties obliging Exhortation, or they, who, by keeping up the Differences of your Subjects, and by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Reproachings and Reflections, endeavour to Repreſent Your peaceable People as Enemies to your Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, tho' they are, and ever have been, as Dutiful and Loyal as themſelves.</p>
            <p>Such may ſee their Practices diſcourag'd by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties healing Example, and would do well to conſider, that their peculiar Duty to your Majeſty lies not in Recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating upon the Infirmities of others, but in Correcting their Own.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty has this compleat Satisfaction concerning all your Subjects, that the principal part of their Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, which Party are moſt Loyal to your Government; and among thoſe who Diſſent from the Church, <hi>None of them</hi> Diſſent from your Intereſt; and thoſe Gentlemen who would fain perſwade the World, that Thoſe who Diſſent from the Eccleſiaſtick Eſtabliſhment, are alſo Enemies to the Civil, have been driven to a Neceſſity of a ſuppos'd Extending the Civil Power beyond the Limits of the Laws, to bring thoſe People they would Expoſe, to ſo much as a Temper of Objecting againſt it.—This is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſo groſly Injurious to your Majeſty, as well as to your Subjects, that it has been long earneſtly wiſh'd You would, on ſome Occaſion or other, let them know how ill pleaſing it was, and how ill it Correſponded, both with your Majeſties Principle as well as Practice, in all the parts of Your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0540600100:6"/>
'Tis an unhappy Violence theſe Men offer to Your Majeſties Character, that they would be content to have your Majeſty become a Tyrant, ſo they might but be capable to prove the Diſſenters Diſloyal to your Government.</p>
            <p>But as we bleſs God that your Majeſty has reſolved to regulate your Government, <hi>by the great Foundation of all Government, the Laws</hi>; ſo we cannot think we offend your Majeſty in ſaying, that in a full Obedience to your Government, and the Laws, none of your Subjects have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in Loyalty more than thoſe that have, at the ſame time, Diſſented in ſome Point of Religion from the Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Church.</p>
            <p>And among thoſe who thus Diſſent, they whoſe Principles are Honeſt, have always regarded the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with a Temper both of Charity and Reſpect; and 'tis to them a matter of no difficulty to entertain a Propoſal of Union in Affection and Intereſt, and to give all the Defference and Diſtinction in Government, to the Eſtabliſh'd Church.</p>
            <p>From whence, and your Majeſty's moſt Generous Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Peace, which, on all occaſions, they moſt readily Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, they humbly hope the Heats and Animoſities of thoſe Gentlemen, who Charge them with Diſloyalty of Principles, will, in Obedience to your Moſt Gracious Speech to your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>be Buried and forgotten,</hi> that they may Enjoy, together with all your Loyal Subjects, the publick Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their Sovereign, till they give your Majeſty ſome juſt Cauſe, <hi>which God forbid,</hi> to withdraw it from them.</p>
            <p>And if this cannot be obtain'd, your Majeſty, and all the World will be Witneſſes to their ſincere Deſires, and forward Endeavours after <hi>the General Union of your Subjects,</hi> and will be effectually ſatisfied at whoſe Doors the black Charge will lye, and to whom we Owe all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Diviſions of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0540600100:7"/>
Your Proteſtant Subjects, Madam, who, as Your Majeſty once obſerv'd, have the <hi>misfortune to Diſſent from the Eſtabliſh'd Church,</hi> have yet a greater misfortune than that, Namely, to be Miſrepreſented to Your Majeſty as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Your Perſon and Government; but among all their Unhappineſs, they Eſteem this as a Bleſſing from Heaven, that they have now an Opportunity offer'd them to Convince Your Majeſty of the honeſty of their Principles, by being the forwardeſt to cloſe with Your Invitation of Peace and Union, as the Thing in all the World which moſt ſuites both their Practice and Inclination.</p>
            <p>Humbly aſſuring Your Majeſty, that as with the greateſt Thankfulneſs they receive the Expreſſions of Your Earneſt Defires for the Peace and Union of all Your Subjects, ſo, with a ſteady Application, they reſolve to be the firſt who ſhall publickly Practice it, and endeavour to Expreſs their Zeal for the Publick Good, and Your Majeſty's Glory, by heartily complying with what they were always Inclin'd to by their Principles and Inclinations, but much more by the Obedience their Duty Calls for to Your Majeſty's Commands of Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>The Humbleſt of your Subjects, Madam, would have Subſcrib'd his Name to a Petition of Pardon, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of this Dedication; but that when he compares his Deſpicable Character with the Glorious Subject he has attempted to Advance; he cannot prevail upon himſelf to let the Cauſe ſuffer by the Meaneſs and Unworthineſs of the Advocate, and only Craves leave to aſſure Your Majeſty, that however he may have been Repreſented, he is a paſſionate Admirer of Peace, an Earneſt Petitioner for the Proſperity of Your Majeſty, and this Kingdom, and the entire Union of all Your Subjects.</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>

            <head>A Challenge of PEACE, ADDRESS'D, <hi>To the whole NATION.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">With an Enquiry into <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> for bringing it to paſs.</head>
            <p>WHEN her Majeſty in her Speech to the Parliament preſs'd the Houſe to Union and Peace, I believe 'twas Included, in her Royal Intentions, that we ſhould all Underſtand her ſpeaking to the whole Nation, and that her Majeſty would have all her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſtudy Concord and Unanimity among themſelves in their Neighbourhood and Converſe, as well as in the Councils and Debates of their Repreſentatives in Parliament.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſuppoſe her Majeſty ſhould mean <hi>a Union of Opinions in Religion,</hi> for tho' I ought to believe her Majeſty Wiſhes all her Proteſtant Subjects were of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0540600100:9"/>
one mind with her ſelf, and followed her Majeſty in the ſame path to Heaven, yet, I cannot believe her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſees it ſo probable as to expect it. But I ſuppoſe her Majeſty to mean that they ſhould all Unite in Affection, where they differ in Opinion; Unite in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Concur in their Obedience to the Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Government; Unite in a Unanimous Agreement of Management, and Unite as to Parties and Factions; Unite as <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> as Chriſtians, and as Proteſtants. This every good Chriſtian would be glad to ſee, and this every Man ought to ſuppoſe himſelf Invited to in her Majeſty's Speech.</p>
            <p>If I am miſtaken, as I believe I am not, let any Man give me a Conſtruction of her Speech more Genuine if they can.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sheets are deſign'd as a Comment upon this Glorious Text, and further, to explain the Subject, and, if poſſible, both deſcribe the Sence, and remove the Obſtructions.</p>
            <p>'Tis a moſt fatal unhappy Circumſtance that every Body is for Peace, and yet no Body will bring it to paſs; all Men agree that Peace is a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from on High, that the want of it among our ſelves Undoes us, Ruins our Preparations at Home, and our Expeditions Abroad, fills us with Fatal Parties, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Animoſities; makes our Councils Confuſed; Our War Tedious; Our Deſigns Abortive, and our Felicity Precarious; want of Peace and Unity among our ſelves makes our Arms leſs Fear'd, our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip leſs Courted, and, in ſhort, is the only thing in the World can ever Ruine us.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded there's not a Man in the Nation but concurs in theſe Generals; but when you come to ſpeak of the particular Steps to be taken to obtain
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0540600100:10"/>
this Bleſſed Article of the Nation's Happineſs, all Men are for having their Neighbours ſtoop to their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but wont yield a jot of their own; they are for making Abatements for other Men, but admit of none for themſelves.</p>
            <p>To come directly to the Point concerning this Union of Parties, I think 'tis neceſſary a little to Examine the Negatives, which are not the ways to obtain this Bleſſing. As</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Sacheverell</hi>'s Bloody Flag of Defiance is not the Way to Peace and Union, <hi>the ſhorteſt Way to Deſtroy, is not the ſhorteſt Way to Unite,</hi> Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Laws to Compel, Reſtrain, or force the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of one another, is not the Way to this Union, which her Majeſty has ſo earneſtly Recommended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To Repeal or Contract the late Act of Tolleration, is not the Way for this ſo much wiſh'd for Happineſs; to have Laws reviv'd that ſhould ſet one Party a Plundering, Excommunicating and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching another, that ſhould renew the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Devaſtations of late Reigns, this will not, by any means, Contribute to this Peace, which all good Men deſire.</p>
            <p>New Aſſociations and Propoſals to diveſt Men of their Free-hold Right for Differences in Opinion, and take away the Right of Diſſenters Voting in Elections of Members; this is not the way to Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>Railing Pamphlets buffooning our Brethren as a Party to be ſuppreſs'd, and dreſſing them up in the Bare's Skin for all the Dogs in the Street to bait them, is not the way to Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>Railing Sermons, exciting People to Hatred and Contempt of their Brethren, becauſe they Differ in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, is not the way to Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0540600100:11"/>
Shutting all People out of Employment, and the Service of their Prince and Country, unleſs they can Comply with indifferent Ceremonies of Religion, is far from the way to Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>Reproaching the Succeſſion, ſettled by Parliament, and Reviving the Abdicated Title of the late K. <hi>James,</hi> and his ſuppos'd Family, cannot tend to this Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>Laws againſt <hi>Occaſional Conformity,</hi> and Compelling People who bear Offices to a Total Conformity, and yet Force them to take and ſerve in thoſe publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cannot contribute to Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the <hi>Negativae,</hi> ſome of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Contraries, the Oppoſites to this bleſſed Peace and Union, which her Majeſty has Recommended to the whole Nation; while theſe things are practis'd or allow'd, I doubt her Majeſty will be defeated of the Expectation She has from the Exhortation She has been pleas'd to make. The Breaches are too wide, the Wound too deep, and ranckl'd almoſt to a Gangreen, and if it goes long without a Cure, will certainly come to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Members, or to a Mortification of Parts. The Breaches of Parties, if not ended in a healing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, will certainly end in the Suppreſſion, if not the Deſtruction, of one Party, if not of all.</p>
            <p>The Ways and Means for this Nation's Deſtruction are very plain and obvious; they are all within our ſelves; they are begun, and carried on, by our Selves; We dig the Grave of the Common-Wealth with our own hands; the fire of Diſcord will burn up the very Bowels of the Nation, and Conſume us inſenſibly, and all owing to the civil Fury of contending Parties. No Nation can deſtroy <hi>England</hi> but it ſelf, and if the Feuds, and Heat of Parties continue, no Nation can prevent our Deſtruction.</p>

Her Majeſty ſenſible of the evil Conſequence, has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a large and very ſeaſonable Caution, and ſolemnly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites all the Nation to lay aſide the Contention of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to embrace Peace, Love, Unity, and Conjunction of Intereſts, that uniting Hearts and Hands in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Defence, the whole Government may be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, her Majeſty the more chearfully Aſſiſted, and the Publick Burthen ſuſtain'd.</p>
            <p>To theſe bleſſed Ends all good Proteſtants ought to Contribute, as far as in them lyes; but as all Parties muſt yield part of their preſent ſtifneſs to the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction her Majeſty deſires, I thought it might not be improper to let all Sides ſee ſome neceſſary Steps, which they not only ſhould, but muſt, and ought, to take, in order to make this Heavenly Work poſſible.</p>
            <p>I humbly conceive all the preſent Diſcord of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be comprehended in theſe Two,<list>
                  <item>Differences in Religion.</item>
                  <item>Differences in Intereſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>One concerns the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the other the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> but both are ſo twiſted together, that it ſeems as if there were no Broil but about Religion, and that <hi>the Church was the only Bone of Contention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as they have generally Leaſt of Religion who Contend moſt about it, ſo in the publick Strife of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there ſeems to be a Colour of Religion plac'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the General Contention, but really, at the bottom, the whole Quarrel is guided by the Intereſts of Parties, Places, Preferments, to get Some in, and Some out, this ſeems the main Thing in hand.</p>
            <p>Parties Contend to get into the Executive Power, that they may put all their Friends into the great Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Offices of the Crown.</p>
            <p>Some would have ſuch a King, or ſuch a Family to Succeed to the Crown, and why? Not ſo much becauſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0540600100:13"/>
this King, or Prince, or Family, is of this, of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but becauſe they are of ſuch, or ſuch a Party, and then ſuch and ſuch Friends get into Employment.</p>
            <p>I don't ſay 'tis impoſſible to reconcile Parties, wave Differences, and bring all to a Temper of Peace, but there is ſo much to be done, ſo much Self-Denial of Practice requir'd, that I dare not ſay, <hi>I hope to ſee it brought to paſs;</hi> and yet I ſhall not deſcend to Particulars, in order only to ſhow the Difficulty, and ſo Diſcourage the Work; but to let you ſee, that tho' it may be Difficult, 'tis not Impoſſible.</p>
            <p>The firſt Article of <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> to this Peace muſt be found in the general Temper of the Nation. There muſt be a Propenſity, a general Inclination to Yield and Bend to one another. 'Tis Nonſence to talk of Particulars, if the general Bent of Men's Thoughts are not firſt brought to Love, Seek, and Deſire Peace; and were this once produc'd, Could any probable Steps be taken in this part, Could there be but an appearance of a Peaceable Temper in the Nation, the reſt of the Work would be found eaſier than we imagin; all Differences would vaniſh, did but the Inclination to <hi>Difference</hi> vaniſh; did the wrangling Temper ceaſe, were but the Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention taken away, the Cauſes of Contention would not be ſo eagerly embrac'd: This is the Tinder of the Nation, which is ſo ready to catch hold of the Fire of Diſſention; this unhappineſs of Temper has been an Old and Epidemick Diſeaſe, and has got ſuch ground among us, 'twill be very hard to have any thing but ſome publick Calamity to Cure it; Affliction reconciles Friends, Common Dangers unite Nations, and Settle disjointed Parties; All are oblig'd to join in Common Defence.</p>
            <p>But 'tis very hard, as well as unkind to our Selves, that we can never be in a Condition to be Reconcil'd to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0540600100:14"/>
one another, till we are juſt at the Door of being ruin'd; That nothing but Enemies can perſwade us to be Friends, and the more violent our Aſſaults are from Abroad; the more forward our Peace is at Home; from whence that Verſe ſeems to be verified of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <l>and by far,</l>
                  <l>Harder to Rule in Times of Peace than War.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſeems a prevaling Juncture to reduce us to a Temper of Peace; forreign Wars, tho' we feel them not in our own Bowels, yet one would think they have preſented a Field ſpacious enough to vent all our Gall and ill Temper in, tho' the War has not been ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, as to put us out of our Selves for fear, yet it has not been ſo inconſiderable, as not to afford us ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Reaſon for Unity, Union of Councils, Union of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Hands and Hearts are all little enough.</p>
            <p>But 'tis in vain to talk of Union till the Temper of Diſunited Parties is brought over to deſire it, we may Unite in Words, but we ſhall never do it in Affection, till all People are willing; Pretences of Union tend but to the widening the Breach, and is like Hypocriſy in Religion, Repreſented in Scripture, by <hi>Drawing near to God with the Mouth, when the Heart is far from him.</hi> He that preſſes his Argument for this Temper, ſhould direct his Speech to all Parties, and to all ſuch I freely ſay, they who have not this Temper of Peace, who do not encline to Union of Intereſt, and Union of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are blind to the publick Benefit of their Native Country, Enemies to the preſent Government, Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful and Diſloyal to her Majeſty, and Underminers of their own Poſterity.</p>
            <p>It may be expected very rationally, that I ſhou'd enter into the particulars of Parties, and Examine who have moſt need to be Exhorted to Union and Peace;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0540600100:15"/>
and tho' I would not be Partial to Parties, yet I cannot help advancing this general Head, that the main Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Diſſention, Strife and Contention, lies now on thoſe Gentlemen who call themſelves <hi>High-Church-Men.</hi> Who can the Invitation to Peace mean, but thoſe People who <hi>want the Hint.</hi> 'Tis plain neither the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Church-men, nor the Diſſenters, can be meant. For they are deſirous of Peace; it is their Intereſt, their Principle, and their Inclination; the Temper ſeems to be plainly ſeen there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The High Church-men</hi> ſay, they are for Peace; but they are for Peace without Union; they are for the Peace of Subjection; they would have all be Peace, that is, their feet on the Necks of their Enemies: But 'tis Peace and Union the Queen has Spoke for, and 'tis <hi>to theſe Gentlemen</hi> the Speech is directed, for they chiefly ſtand in need of the Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Men who carry the heat of their Arguments out to the Extream of Reproach, and the Indecency of Contempt; theſe are the Men that Print, Preach, and Crie up all Modern Diſcontents that ſtrive to blacken their Brethren with Marks of Diſtinction; theſe are they that have Stigmatiz'd all the Men of Moderation, with the Brand of Low-Church-men, and all other Writings Repreſent them as Traytors to their Friends, to the Church, and to their own Principles, worſe than Diſſenters, Fanaticks or Schiſmaticks; and yet all I can find theſe Gentlemen Charg'd with, is, that they are not for <hi>tearing People to pieces for Religion, and ruining their Diſſenting Brethren the Shorteſt Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are the Gentlemen</hi> who have lifted up the <hi>Bloody Flag</hi> againſt their Proteſtant Neighbours, and declared, that all the True Church-men are bound to Liſt in the New <hi>Cruſado</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0540600100:16"/>
               <hi>Theſe are the Gentlemen</hi> who are for Confounding, and not Converting, their Friends the Diſſenters, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of deſiring them to Conform, are for preventing that Occaſional Communion they can comply with in order to keep them out of Places; ſo that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep up the Schiſm in the Church, than obtain a Union at the Price of their temporal Advancement, diſcovering a true Chriſtian Spirit in being <hi>neither willing to let us Diſſent, nor Conform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are the Gentlemen</hi> that have the moſt need to learn the Doctrine of Peace and Union, ſince, if they pleaſed, we might be ſoon remov'd from the moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious divided Nation in the World, to an univerſal Family of Love and Chriſtian Charity, endeavouring to win and engage one another by Mildneſs and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſtrugling to fortifie our Opinions by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emulation of Love and good Works.</p>
            <p>The Charge ſeems great, but might eaſily be made out, that this Party only are the Agreſſors in Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Low Church-Men,</hi> as they call them, are Men of Moderation and Peace, and hated by theſe becauſe they are ſo; they are neither for oppreſſing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, nor Impoſing upon the Conſcience; a large Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for their fellow Chriſtians, averſion to Perſecution, tenderneſs of Property and the Laws, <hi>are their peculiar Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe</hi> there is no occaſion of ſpeaking a word, for they are with her Majeſty Heart and Hand for Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0540600100:17"/>
               <hi>To theſe we owe</hi> the Act of Toleration, and the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uneaſie Conſciences of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe we owe</hi> the Reſtoring of Parliaments to their due Power, and that Power to its frequent exerciſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe we owe</hi> the Diſarming the Eccleſiaſtical Harpies, and paring the Talons and Claws of the Church Vultures, who were always tearing to pieces, and preying upon their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe we owe</hi> the Currency and Supremacy of the Laws, and the Juſt Conceſſion of Right made to the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe we owe</hi> the late Revolution, Depoſing the Diſpenſing Arbitrary Will of approaching Tyranny,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe we owe</hi> the ſecuring our Poſterity in the poſſeſſion of their indubitable Rights, under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Succeſſion, and removing the Nation's Fears from a precarious unſettled futurity. What have not theſe men of Peace done for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> are the Center to which all Parties, if they will have peace, muſt encline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe</hi> the Diſſenters freely and chearfully remit the Truſt of Government, and the Conduct of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> are the Men whom the Diſſenters are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally willing ſhould Reign over them, and from among whom, if it was in their Choice, they would demand a King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With theſe</hi> Liberty, Property, Conſcience, Law, Juſtice, and all the parts of the Conſtitution are ſecure; their end is Peace, and their mean Juſtice and the Laws.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters and theſe have but One Intereſt, and there never was a Man of theſe in Poſt of Truſt or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0540600100:18"/>
Honour in the Nation, who kept Cloſe to this Honeſt Principle, but the Diſſenters lov'd him, ſtood by him, voted for him, and in all Caſes needful Vindicated and Encourag'd him.</p>
            <p>Nor do the Diſſenters ſtand in ſo much need of this Peaceable hint relating to the publick; for they have never been found embroyling the State, or breaking the publick Meaſures; they have been miſrepreſented as Engroſing and Poſſeſſing the places of Truſt and Profit in the laſt Reign, but the Caſe remains unprov'd; and in all the black Roll of Miſmanagement repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Majeſty, in the Addreſs of the Houſe of Commons, I fairly Challenge any Man to ſhew me the Name of One Diſſenter; they have ſuffer'd in the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities Occaſion'd by thoſe miſs-Conducts, they have born the ſhare of Taxes miſapply'd, and Deficiencies of Funds; but they can never prove upon them, that any Diſſenters were either Perſonally or Occaſionally Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in thoſe Defects, your <hi>Ran—s</hi> your Sr. <hi>John M—</hi>Sr. <hi>R— G—. W—</hi>and <hi>J—</hi>were none of them Diſſenters, the Frauds and Treacheries of the late Reign cannot be laid at their Door.</p>
            <p>All their Grievances are, that they ſuffer by other Men's Knavery, that they are threatned with the Repeal of the Tolleration, blacken'd with ſlanders, and bullied with bloody Flags, Defiances, and <hi>Billinſgate</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, from the Preſs and from the Pulpit, their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſes repreſented as Houſes of Sedition, and the World asks this inſolent Queſtion in Print. <hi>Whether is worſe or more pernicious to the Government, a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe or a Play-Houſe?</hi> They are daily ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Indignities of hair-brain'd Prieſts, buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poets, and Clubs of inſolent Pamphleters; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0540600100:19"/>
'twould be endleſs to quote the Bear-Garden language thrown upon them in a rapſody of prints, which they ſuffer with Regret, but have always born with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being remov'd, the Diſſenters are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally at eaſe; the Liberty of their Perſons, ſafety of their Properties and Birth right, and the Tolleration of their Conſciences are the full of all their demand; and theſe being ſecur'd, we may ſafely defye all the Power of Malice to charge upon them the breach of the Publick-quiet, or any Encroachment upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, their Nighbours, or the Laws.</p>
            <p>The Aſſaults of their intemperate Adverſaries may have fill'd them with juſt Apprehenſions, that the ſub. verſion of their Liberty is deſign'd, and they will perhaps be ready to ſay they have good Reaſon for it; but as her Majeſty has always Comforted them with the full Aſſurance of her Royal Word in that Caſe, they have always behav'd with Duty and Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to her Majeſty, and every part of her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and let thoſe who have ſo openly attempted to prove the Diſſenters fatal to the Engliſh Conſtitution, and conſequently have propoſed to have them depriv'd of their Birth-right as Free-holders, let them give an inſtance of One Act of diſloyalty which they have been Guilty of to her Majeſty, to merit ſo much her Royal diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters therefore do not come in as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Subjects of this Exhortation to Peace, their Circumſtances, their Intereſts, their Number, their Eſtates oblige them to Peace, and they cannot be Fomenters of our Breaches and Diviſions, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0540600100:20"/>
Fools and Mad-men, blind to their own happineſs, and <hi>Thieves to their Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this bleſſed Motion of peace affects the Diſſenters at all, it muſt be as it reſpects the <hi>Conduct of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to themſelves;</hi> the infinite Feuds, Diviſions and Animoſities harbour'd among their ſeparate Parties, and daily expreſt againſt one another, is too much a ſcandal upon them as Chriſtians, and too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches their Morals as Men: And here 'tis to be acknowledg'd they deſerve reproof, and cannot defend themſelves, wherefore they are moſt juſtly call'd upon by her Majeſty's Speech, and by the whole Nation to hearken to Peace.</p>
            <p>Their Character as Chriſtians, their Pretences of more than Common Reformation, their Intereſt as a Party, their Profeſſion, their God and their Queen all call upon them to Peace and Union; Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affection, if not Union of Profeſſion; Union of Practice, if not Union of Principle.</p>
            <p>Having thus run through the Parties who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in this matter, it leads me to repeat to my Reader, that were the temper of peace, were the propenſity to a general Union, fix'd in the Breaſts of theſe Parties, there might be ſome hopes that a further progreſs might be made; but there muſt firſt be an inclination to Peace, before there can be any real Foundation to hope for it: I know nothing in the World could have been a greater ſtep to form this inclination in the Minds of all Parties, than the vehemence with which her Majeſty has been pleas'd to recommend it in her Speech; 'Tis a call from Heaven by the Mouth of the Queen, and doubtleſs her Majeſty was inſpir'd from thence, to move that particular Article of her Speech with ſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0540600100:21"/>
much uncommon earneſtneſs, that thoſe whoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd any thoughts of her Majeſty's being b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſt by a Party, might ſee their miſtake; that the Party them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who began too much to depend upon her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage in their ill Deſigns, might be diſcourag'd, and that all her People might ſee her Majeſty was entirely engag'd in the general Intereſt of her People's good, without reſpect to Parties, to Faction, or the private projects of deſigning People about her.</p>
            <p>For my part, I confeſs my ſelf ſurpris'd with Joy, to find her Majeſty's Eyes open to the general Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her People, and ſhould take it for a Judgment upon the Nation, if the Peoples Eyes ſhould remain ſhut to their own felicity, and that Feuds and Parties ſhould have run us to that extreme, that even a healing Monarch cannot Unite us.</p>
            <p>It has not been a common thing for the Nation to be Summon'd to Unity and Peace from the Throne; evil Princes have been ſhye and jealous of the Union of their Subjects, and maintaining and keeping up the Jealouſies and Animoſities of Parties, has been thought a needful policy to protect the Crown. But this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice has been a juſt Satyr upon thoſe Princes that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd it, as a certain Demonſtration they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>to impoſe,</hi> which nothing but the private Feuds of Parties could bring them to conſent to.</p>
            <p>The Union of Subjects is the Dread of Tyrants; for no People in the World would bear the Inſults and Cruelties of Encroaching Arbitrary Princes, were not the People themſelves divided in Intereſts, Parties,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0540600100:22"/>
Factions and Deſigns. It is a token for good to the People of <hi>England,</hi> that the Queen, however by a ſort of men ſhe has been miſrepreſented and abus'd, has yet this Teſtimony to give the World of her Juſtice, and the Integrity of her Deſigns, that ſhe covets that Peace among all her People, which ſome of her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Anceſtors have been afraid to bring upon the Stage.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of being afraid of the Union of her Subjects, ſhe is of nothing more deſirous than to bring out that bleſſed Article, to ſee all her Subjects practiſing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Kindneſs one to another. The Reaſon is plain, her Majeſty having regulated her Conduct by the Laws, and confin'd her Deſires to the Happineſs of her People, ſhe can give no Teſtimony of it like this, that ſhe covets to ſee them United in the Bonds of Love, and walking Hand in Hand in her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>None but Tyrants covet to be fear'd, Juſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces value themſelves upon the Love of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <q>The Hearts of Subjects are the Strength of Kings.</q>
            <p>Now 'tis impracticable to have all the People joyn in Duty and Affection to their Prince, while they are embroyl'd with heat and paſſions one with another; <hi>univerſal Love, makes univerſal Loyalty:</hi> No Subjects are ſo true to their Prince, nor ſo hearty to his Cauſe, as thoſe who are United among themſelves, and Unanimous in their way of living.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0540600100:23"/>
While therefore her Majeſty invites all her Subjects to Union and Peace, 'tis a certain Indication of her reſolv'd Deſign to Govern this Nation by the Laws, and preſerve the Rights and Liberties of her Subjects: She would elſe be very unwilling the People ſhould have any endearing Converſation among themſelves, leaſt one time or other they ſhould open their Eyes to ſee the way to Liberty, and caſt off the yoak of their intended Slavery. But if her Majeſty calls us to Peace, ſhe calls us to Freedom, and lets us know She is far from encouraging the miſchievous Deſigns of thoſe who ſtrive to bring in diſtruction at the door of Contention, and who are willing to keep up the ſtrife of the People, that they might not agree in their own deliverance.</p>
            <p>I confeſs my ſelf ſurpriz'd at this diſcovery of the Royal intentions to Peace and Union, and that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not her Majeſty had yet ſeen far enough into the malicious Deſigns of that Party, who deſign'd to engage her on one part of her people againſt the other, and have had many a melancholy Proſpect of the conſequences of a Nation divided againſt her ſelf: Nor do I know any way in the World to have given that hot Temper ſo Univerſal an overthrow, as her Majeſty has now taken, <hi>viz.</hi> To let them know that what ever they may expect from her, how much ſoever they may fancy they pleaſe her in running down One Party to raiſe and eſtabliſh another, <hi>her Majeſty is not of their Mind.</hi> The Queen knows a better way to hold the Ballance of Parties, than to erect any One upon the deſtruction of another; what ever the Opinions in Religion are, they are all her Majeſties Subjects, they have all a Title to her Protection, while

they behave themſelves Dutifuly to her Perſon and Government; reconciling their Plrinciples is none of her Majeſty's Province as Queen, and if it were, ſeems but too impracticable; but to reconcile their Perſons, make them uſeful to her ſelf, converſible to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quiet and obedient to the Laws and her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, this her Majeſty profeſſes to Deſire, is Her Reſolution, and all her People's advantage.</p>
            <p>In Concurrence with this Deſign, 'tis our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſtrive who is the forwardeſt for Peace, that her Majeſty may be convinc'd who are the Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Nation; <hi>Mark ſuch as ſow Diviſions:</hi> let us Mark our ſelves for Viſible Healers of Diviſions, and the Contrary will mark the Wideners of Our Breaches.</p>
            <p>As I have Undertaken to advance in the behalf of the Diſſenters, that they are the forwardeſt to Embrace this Univerſal Peace, ſo I hope I ſhall not be aſham'd to affirm, That both their Intereſt and their Principles Concur to preſs them to it, and I yet hope their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice will not let me, nor any One who Undertakes the Vindication of their Cauſe, be aſham'd of being their Advocate.</p>
            <p>They cannot be Enemies to this Reconciliation of Parties, unleſs at the ſame time they have loſt their Senſes, and are qualifying themſelves for <hi>Bedlam;</hi> and I am of the Opinion, that had a General Aſſembly of all the Diſſenters in this Nation been met together, to Conſider what they would Deſire her Majeſty to do for them, I mean for them particularly as Diſſenters, they could have thought of nothing more material to them and the whole Nation, than a Ceſſation of this Party Strife, and a Civil Union with all the reſt of her Majeſty's Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0540600100:25"/>
What elſe had they to ask? Their Properties are ſecur'd by the Law, their Religion by the Tolleration, and both reaſſur'd by the Queen's repeated Promiſes to Continue them. They Could have nothing more to ask, but that her Majeſty would do what in her Wiſdom ſhe ſhould find Conducing to a general Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Affection, between them and thoſe People from whom they were oblig'd to Diſſent in Point of Religion.</p>
            <p>This her Majeſty has done without their Application, and I think the Diſſenters cannot anſwer it to the Senſe of their Own Intereſt, if they do not make publick acknowledgment to God and Her Majeſty for ſo remarkable a Mercy.</p>
            <p>Had we Beaten the <hi>French</hi> Fleet at Sea, or had any more than Ordinary Advantage over the Nation's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies been Obtained; We ſhould, and reaſon good, have made a Day of publick Rejoycing and Thankſgiving to God for ſo great a Bleſſing, and by Addreſſes of Congratulation Complimented her Majeſty upon that head.</p>
            <p>This is a Victory over the worſt Enemy the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has, an Enemy the moſt Fatal and moſt Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable of any in the World; Contention is the Devil's Generaliſſimo, that has always led on the Infernal Troops to Invade the Peace of this Unhappy Nation; Her Majeſty has given an Overthrow to the Grand Army of Hell, and Diſpers'd the Numerous Squadrons that were Embatteling themſelves againſt the general Quiet,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0540600100:26"/>
and who verily thought they had the Queen on their ſide.</p>
            <p>It remains for all Her Subjects to purſue the flying Troops of this Defeated Army, and to deſtroy and remove all the little Foundations of Party Feuds, Fears, Jealouſies, Reproaches, and Raillery that blow up the Grand Flame of Diſcord in the Nation.</p>
            <p>Would all Parties fall in heartily with Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Command, a General Kiſs of Friendſhip and Reconciliation would paſs thro' theſe three Kingdoms, the Wolf and the Lamb would lye down together, Peace would ſmother all the remains of Enmity, and the Seeds of Diſſention would Dye in the Earth, and ſpring up no more.</p>
            <p>And that I may not ſeem to preſs my Readers to think of what I cannot direct them how to do. I think it not improper to ſay, this Work is not Difficult, 'tis eaſier to agree than to fall out, if Men were all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Peace.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not pretend in the ſhort Compaſs of theſe Sheets, to draw a full Scheem of a Project of Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the General Parties, nor unleſs I were Directed would I engage in any thing ſo Nice, having no need to feel the further Reſentment of thoſe who may no more be pleas'd with the Project, than they are with the Perſon. But I will Venture to touch the Preliminaries, and tell the People of <hi>England</hi> how they may begin, I'le put them into the Road, in which if they pleaſe but to go on <hi>ſtraight forward,</hi> as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0540600100:27"/>
they ſay, they cannot fail to arrive at the Port of Peace.</p>
            <p>Not at all to concern matters of Religion and Opinions about worſhipping God with our Civil Affairs, and common Charity, leaving all People freely, as now the Laws do, to the dictates of the Spirit, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Religion is a matter of Peace, <hi>the ways of God are ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all his Paths are Peace,</hi> which tho' it means ſpeculative Peace, yet I may apply it here; there is nothing in Religion which has a tendency to ſowre our Tempers, ruffle our Converſation, or diſorder our Lives. As to Converting one another, the Scripture is full of Rules to direct us to act in that by the Power of Perſwaſion; even Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is to be done with the Spirit of Meekneſs, ſays the Apoſtle and Rebuking one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in Love, and provoking one another to Love and to good Works; and if the Scripture were ſilent in the caſe, the Reaſon and Nature of the thing ſeems to imply, that all coercive Methods are vain as well as unlawful, as to Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Experience might convince thoſe Sons of Violence who are for Perſecution of their Neighbours, that it has been a fruitleſs War; and if we were to examine how many Converts to the Church have been made by ſuch Meaſures, I doubt they can give but a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der account of the Fruit of that Method whereof the whole Church is now aſham'd. I ſay aſham'd, for that <hi>In</hi> the Preamble to a late Bill for the preventing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0540600100:28"/>
Occaſional Conformity, 'tis there own'd, <hi>that Perſecution for Conſcience is Contrary to the Principles of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and to the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>I avoid all the juſt Examples I could give of the Irregularities and Oppreſſions the Diſſenters have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd under on this head; that I may begin with my ſelf, and bury the remembrances of Violences and ill Uſage, in this new Reſolution of Peace which we are all invited to by her Majeſty, and which I hope all the Diſſenters in the Nation will be the moſt forward to accept.</p>
            <p>But as to future Conduct let matters of Religion be things of ſerious Choice, but not of Violence and Debate, we may Differ but not Quarrel; we may Diſſent, without Cenſure and Uncharitableneſs; they may Conform, without Envy and Reproach; Honeſt Men ſhould agree with honeſt Men, of whatſoever Opinion they may be, and not with Knaves whatſoever Party they take. <hi>A little Charity ſown on good Land would produce a huge Crop of Peace.</hi> And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Grace it ſelf, planted in a ſoil barren of Charity, ſours and grows moroſe.</p>
            <p>What has Religion to do with Politicks? Honeſt Men of all Perſwaſions are honeſt Men, and Knaves are the worſe, the more pretence they make to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; we ſhould not have a tenth part of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in State-Affairs, did not Church-matters and State-matters mingle ſo much together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0540600100:29"/>
The Law has plac'd the Adminiſtration in the hands of the Church, and tho' there has been a thouſand reviling Pamphlets that have accus'd the Diſſenters of repining at it, yet not one Diſſenter can be charg'd with a Deſign to alter it; let but Peace and moderate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples poſſeſs the Men of Government, the Diſſenters were always content, and ever will be pleas'd to have the Power reſt in the hands of the Church; and where this Peace and Moderation is not, I believe all men will grant me that the principal Qualifications for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are wanting.</p>
            <p>'Tis nothing but the want of this Peace and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which has made the matters of Religion and Government Claſh, and the whole Nation fall out about them; and if any Man ſhall attempt to prove that this contentious Spirit has been on the ſide of the Diſſenters, I think I may not be tax'd with Arrogance, if I ſay I can eaſily conſute him.</p>
            <p>But however it has been, <hi>for Peace never Recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi> I ſhall adventure in the Name of the Diſſenters, preſuming upon their univerſal Conſent, and with the Conſent of ſome of the moſt Judicious among them, to make their Adverſaries this fair Challenge.</p>
            <p>Let the ſincerity of the peaceable Spirit be try'd by the Conſequence: The Queen has made a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to Peace and Union, and we accept it; let her Majeſty now ſee who are her moſt Loyal Subjects, who are greateſt Friends to the general Intereſt, and the trueſt Lovers of their Country, by diſtinguiſhing among them who have moſt regard to her earneſt Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0540600100:30"/>
and who are really and unfeignedly of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tempers and Principles, and who are not; who are moſt for Peace and Union, who readieſt to obey their Soveraign's Command, who honeſteſt to their own Pretences, the High Church-Men or the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>If this Challenge would be accepted, if perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by both Parties were to meet, how eaſie would it be to ſettle Conditions of mutual Society, agreement of Parties, and general Charity in the whole Nation, which whoever would break, ſhould be hiſt out of all Converſation, contemn'd by all ſides, and no body care to ſpeak to him.</p>
            <p>All this might be done, and Religion never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the matter, the Concerns of Conſcience would be a Claſs by it ſelf, and never make a rupture in our Civil Society; Men would be Gentlemen as well as Chriſtians, and the Union of Converſation and Intereſt would make a little Heaven in the Nation.</p>
            <p>We ſhould no more be cutting of Throats about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſending one another to the Devil for not going to Heaven our own way.</p>
            <p>This would be the Shorteſt way with the Diſſenters, and <hi>Sachavrell</hi>'s bloody Flag would be a Fool to it.</p>
            <p>This would make us be Diſſenters and no Diſſenters, and there would be a Conformity in Civil Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, tho' there was none in Religious.</p>
            <p>This would bring the Chriſtian and the <hi>Engliſh-Man</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0540600100:31"/>
to underſtand one another, who have been a long while at variance.</p>
            <p>This would make the Devil out of Love with the Climate, and People would get to Heaven with the leſs interruption.</p>
            <p>In a word, 'twould be a Strength to our Millitary Power, a Glory to our Civil, and a Luſtre to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. 'Twould make the Nation Invincible, the Laws Impregnable, Trade Encreaſe, Religion Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, the Queen Victorious, and the People Happy.</p>
