            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MR. Martin, good morning! you are abroad very early. Have you alter'd your hour of riſing, or are you troubled with a bad conſcience?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>I make you as early a viſit as this is, my dear girl, each morning of my life—in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;—but I now pay my duty to you in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and by order of my maſter. He, poor ſoul! full of anxiety, bad me attend your levée for an account of the health of that ſweet ſwain his uncle, How has he paſſed the night?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Never worſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>Heav'n be praiſed! The old fellow muſt have had a noble conſtitution, or he never could have ſtood buff; at once to ſo many diſeaſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Very true. He has twice within theſe two days fallen into my arms in a profound lethargy:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1129801800:6"/>and, I believe, no earthly care but mine could have revived him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>O curſe your care! And pray how are you rewarded?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I can't ſay I have either preſent pay, or good quarters. He ſeems ſenſible of my good offices; but begs to be excuſed the paying for them.—He, indeed, promiſes faithfully to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me in his Will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>What, is he going to make one at laſt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Immediately—where my name, I believe, will make no ſmall figure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>Heav'n ſend it, ſay I!—the old fellow muſt be very rich.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Rich! ſo he had need be to ſatisfy all thoſe who are gaping for his death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>He'll treat them with a mouthful of moonſhine. My maſter flatters himſelf the beſt part of the wealth will fall to his lot. I think, I, as a relation, am entitled to a legacy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>A relation! You!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>Yes I—My maſter and his uncle are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that can't be deny'd.—My late wife was as obliging as ſhe was handſome—indeed we were look'd on as the moſt agreeable couple in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh—but let that paſs. She, I ſay, by a ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of that good nature for which ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, took care that my maſter and I ſhould be kin. O, I'm certainly one of the family.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>At that rate, I believe, you are related to more families than this. O wedlock would be a wealthy ſtate indeed if huſbands could inherit by ſuch a title.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>True, true—but joking apart—'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we ſhould do every thing in our power to forward this will, get it made, and to our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1129801800:7"/>liking too—for if my maſter ſhould not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered by the old gentleman, he muſt, the reſt of his days, take up with very ſpare diet. But what is moſt materially to be conſidered, is the reward of five hundred, which he has promiſed to give you and me, as ſecret ſervice money, on the day of his marriage with Myra: and which, to avoid diſputes concerning dividends, you have conſented ſhall be common ſtock, and we are to follow their example. O, here comes my maſter.—</p>

               <p>Well, my dear Lucetta, what news? af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me ſome comfort! How is my poor uncle? How has he paſſed the night? Can he bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? May I be permitted to ſee him this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Really, Sir, he has paſſed the night very ill; and, if I can form any judgment, he has not a right to expect many more on this ſide the grave.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
               <p>Good heav'n! What ſay you, Lucetta? Notwithſtanding my great expectations, duty and nature are very powerful in me; and his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing end cauſes certain emotions, which you cannot feel, or I deſcribe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mart.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot anſwer for her feelings, or your deſcriptions; but as to emotions, I believe they are ſuch as I felt when I paid the laſt duties to my poor dear wife of pious memory. I found myſelf attacked by a kind of a certain fort of a—flow—pungent—pleaſing—melancholy—that had ſuch an effect on my ſpirits, that—as if—in ſhort, as you ſay, Sir, it is a ſituation eaſier felt than told, and what many a married man wiſhes to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1129801800:8"/>that he may become a more competent judge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>—I believe the old gentleman begins to think himſelf in a bad way at laſt; for he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to provide two proctors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
               <p>My heart throbs to find my fate ſo near its criſis.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Be of good cheer, Sir; I believe all will go well: within theſe two days he and your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs's mother, Mrs. Watchly, were laying their heads together, and in deep muttering for ſome time—Deeds—legacies—marriages, and ſo forth; and I make no doubt the main point was making a conditional match for you and the young lady.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
               <p>Don't flatter me, Lucetta. Heaven is my witneſs, I ſhould not think wealth worth a wiſh, did it not ſhorten the journey of my deſires to my dear Myra.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, Sir, you are in a fair way of having both—Nay, I make no doubt of your being ſole heir.—Troth 'twould grieve me to ſee the ſtock divided: for, Sir, I know you would do a world of good with it.—Now, as to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Martin and me, I know—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
               <p>Say no more of that, Lucetta: I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my promiſe, and will be even better than my word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>O, Sir, I don't doubt your generoſity: and I hope I may venture to ſay, I ſhall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy. I have always kept praiſing you and your good qualities to the old gentleman. —Lord, Sir, ſays I, how happy are you in ſuch a nephew! ſo ſweet a diſpoſition! ſo complaiſant! ſo reſpectful! not urged to attend you, like moſt of your relations, from a principle of ſelfiſhneſs, but by a regard of the moſt delicate and tender nature.</p>

               <p>O, Mr. Caveat, I am too full of joy to talk about my will now—But ſend me a blank li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; come to me in the evening, and I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you all.
<stage>[Exit Proctors.</stage> Nephew, run this moment to Mrs. Watchly and her daughter Myra; bring them to me directly!— Lucetta! do you and Martin get all the aſſiſtance you can, and procure me a wedding feaſt in a hurry. If I don't ſee you married, nephew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I die, I ſhan't die in peace; and that I may die in peace, I muſt ſee you wedded and bedded directly. Ah Martin, you have been a great rogue to be ſure, but I forgive you, I'm in a humour now to forgive every body.</p>

               <p>Indeed, Sir, it is more than he deſerves; but after the indulgence ſhewn to me, I think I muſt forgive him.</p>

               <p>Forgive me! is that all?—ſo the beſt of my ſituation is likely to be that of wearing this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1129801800:34"/>livery during pleaſure;—a vile exchange for two hundred a year and my wife's portion!—I am now oblig'd to return to the comb and the cloath bruſh —tho' tis hardly a minute ago that my head was full of nothing but lands, tenements and proviſion for younger children,—however I ought not to complain, 'tis a proper puniſhment for my eager deſire of growing rich too ſoon;—but—courage! give me thy hand, Lucetta!—I am not yet afraid to follow my maſter in matrimony; and will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward endeavour to imitate him in every virtue.</p>
               <l>We ſee in him integrity rewarded,</l>
               <l>While ſcheming Martin's very near diſcarded:</l>
               <l>In future plans contracted be our views,</l>
               <l>The proverb ſays—who covet all—all loſe.</l>
