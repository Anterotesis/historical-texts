            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SECTION I. <hi>The</hi> DESIGN.</head>
            <p>THERE are two Cauſes, eſſentially diſtinct, though often interwoven, by which a free State may periſh. Theſe are, <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> Violence: <hi>Invaſions</hi> from Abroad, or <hi>Diſſentions</hi> at Home: The Rage of foreign <hi>War,</hi> or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic <hi>Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a dangerous and exhauſting War, Victory hath at length reſtored Peace to our bleeding Country. But in vain the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0043801700:9"/>
Sword of War is ſheathed, if in Time of Peace the Poignard of <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> is drawn, and madly level'd by many of our Countrymen, at the Breaſts of their Fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p>To prevent the fatal Conſequences of this deluded or deluding Spirit, is the Purpoſe of this Eſſay: In which the Writer will endeavour to trace the preſent State of Things to its general Foundations: By pointing out the real Baſis and genuine Characteriſtics of true Liberty; by unmaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing the Pretences, and laying open the ſecret <hi>Sources</hi> and diſtinctive <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the political Principles here laid down and inforced, will be found ſtrictly connected with Religion and Morals; no Apology will be made for endeavouring to eſtabliſh the public Happineſs of Mankind on the ſolid Baſis of <hi>Virtue,</hi> which is the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Religion itſelf.—</hi>In this Point the Writer confirms himſelf on the Authority of an excellent and learned Prelate, whoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0043801700:10"/>
political Reſearches were of like Tendency. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As the Sum of human Happineſs is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſiſt in the Goods of Mind, Body, and Fortune, I would fain make my Studies of ſome Uſe to Mankind, with Regard to each of theſe three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; and hope it will not be thought faulty or indecent in any Man, of what Profeſſion ſoever, to offer his Mite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards improving the <hi>Manners</hi> (I will add, the <hi>Religion) Health,</hi> and <hi>Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of his Fellow-Creatures. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Berkley</hi>'s Miſc. p. 118.</note>"</q>

            <head>SECT. II. Of the Nature of Civil Liberty.</head>
            <p>TO ſome it will doubtleſs appear a ſuperfluous Labour, to fix the true Idea of <hi>civil Liberty,</hi> in a Country which boaſts itſelf <hi>free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0043801700:11"/>
Yet the Writer eſteems it a neceſſary though obvious Taſk: Not only that he may appeal to his Idea of it, thus eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; but alſo, becauſe in the <hi>Conduct</hi> (at leaſt) if not in the <hi>Writings</hi> of his Countrymen, it ſeems to have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſtaken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>natural Liberty</hi> of Man, conſidered merely as a ſolitary and ſavage Individual, would generally lead him to a full and unbounded Proſecution of all his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. Some Savages there are, though few, who live nearly, if not altogether, in this <hi>brutal</hi> State of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe laſt Expreſſions, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, are inadequate to their Subject: For ſuch a State of Man is worſe than that of Brutes, and in the ſtrict Senſe, is alſo <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Nature.</hi> For Brutes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with unerring Inſtincts, which Man poſſeſſeth not: Therefore ſuch a ſolitary and wretched State is ſtrictly <hi>unnatural;</hi> becauſe it prevents the Exertion of thoſe Powers, which his <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining:</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0043801700:12"/>
But thoſe <hi>Powers Society</hi> alone can <hi>call forth</hi> into <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man is therefore formed for <hi>Society:</hi> That is, Man is formed for Intercourſe with Man: Hence, through the natural Deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopement of the human Powers, a Variety of new <hi>Wants,</hi> a Neceſſity for mutual <hi>Aids</hi> and diſtinct <hi>Properties,</hi> muſt ariſe: From theſe, a new <hi>Acceſſion,</hi> as well as a frequent <hi>Diſagreement</hi> and <hi>Claſhing</hi> of <hi>Deſires</hi> muſt inevitably enſue. Hence the Neceſſity of <hi>curbing</hi> and <hi>fixing</hi> the <hi>Deſires</hi> of Man in the ſocial State; by ſuch <hi>equal Laws,</hi> as may compel the <hi>Appetites</hi> of each <hi>Individual</hi> to yield to the <hi>common Good</hi> of <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this ſalutary <hi>Reſtraint, civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> is derived. Every natural Deſire which might in any Reſpect be inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the general Weal, is given up as a voluntary Tax, paid for the higher, more laſting, and more important <hi>Benefits,</hi> which we reap from <hi>ſocial Life.</hi>

            <p>FROM the Nature of civil Liberty, thus delineated, the Nature of <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs</hi> will eaſily be fixed: Being indeed no other than <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Every Deſire carry'd into Action, which in any Reſpect violates thoſe equal Laws, eſtabliſhed for the common Benefit of the Whole."</q>
            </p>

            <p>The Author of the <hi>Fable of the Bees</hi> hath boldly laid down this; which, as a ruling Principle, pervades his whole Work.

            <p>But, ſecondly, they may imply, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that Thoughts, Speculations, Opinions, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, however received and imbibed by the Mind of Man, have no Connexion with his Actions; at moſt, no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion ſo neceſſary and ſtrong as to give the Magiſtrate a Right to <hi>regulate</hi> them by <hi>any Means</hi> whatever.

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0043801700:22"/>
This is not only a poſſible Interpretation, but in all Appearance, the more natural of the two. For it is not here once ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by this Author, that <hi>Opinions</hi> have any <hi>Influence</hi> on <hi>Actions;</hi> but rather, that they concern <hi>nobody</hi> but <hi>Him</hi> who <hi>holds</hi> them. 'Tis true, he ſpeaks of them as being <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and <hi>religious:</hi> But if they be the mere Reſult of private and fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Thought, unaided by the Regulations of civil Policy, I ſee not why they may not more probably be <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:</hi> Becauſe they are more likely to be model'd by <hi>ruling Appetites</hi> than <hi>rational Deduction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame Time, it is but Juſtice to this Author to ſay, that he certainly meant not (like the Author of the <hi>Fable of the Bees)</hi> to diſcard all <hi>moral</hi> Principles as groundleſs and chimerical; whatever his Intentions were with Regard to <hi>Religion.</hi> But his Expreſſions are <hi>ambiguous,</hi> and have been laid hold of by Men of the moſt libertine Opinions: Therefore in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0043801700:23"/>
whatever Senſe they were <hi>written,</hi> it is neceſſary to oppoſe them, in that Senſe in which they have been <hi>received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And farther, this is certain: That the Principle implied in this ſecond Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath paſſed into a general Maxim in this Kingdom, among thoſe who pique themſelves on <hi>unlimited Freedom</hi> of <hi>Thought.</hi> Theſe Men have long and openly derided every <hi>Regulation</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Principle;</hi> have diſcarded all <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> under the deſpiſed Idea, of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Education;</hi> have laid it down as their fundamental Maxim, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that you are to think what you will: Only to act ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly."</q> Not attending to that eſſential Connexion which ſubſiſts between <hi>Thoughts, Opinions, Principles,</hi> and ACTIONS.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, any Society of Men, aiming at the Eſtabliſhment of civil Liberty, have a Right to unite themſelves on what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they pleaſe. But it is the Purpoſe of this Eſſay, to prove, by Reaſonings confirmed by Facts, that a free Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0043801700:24"/>
built on the Maxims above delivered, cannot be of <hi>long Duration:</hi> That the mere <hi>coercive Power</hi> of <hi>human Laws</hi> is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to <hi>ſuſtain itſelf:</hi> That there is a ſtrong and unalterable <hi>Connexion</hi> between <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Actions:</hi> That a certain <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of Principles is neceſſary to check the ſelfiſh Paſſions of Man; and prevent <hi>Liberty</hi> from degenerating into <hi>Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a certain Syſtem of Manners and Principles, mutually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting each other, and pervading the whole Community, are the only perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Foundation on which true civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty can ariſe."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The natural Appetites, Paſſions, and Deſires of Man, are the univerſal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his Actions: Without the Impulſe which he receives from <hi>thoſe,</hi> he would be at once unfeeling and inactive. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, according to the State and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his Deſires, his Actions will <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> be good or evil; innocent, uſeful, or deſtructive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0043801700:25"/>
Were theſe Deſires univerſally coincident with the Welfare and Happineſs of others, no coercive Power would be wanting, as the Means of producing and ſecuring perfect Liberty.</p>
            <p>But the acknowledged Neceſſity of penal Laws affords an inconteſtable Proof, that the <hi>unbridled Deſires</hi> of Man are utterly inconſiſtent with the Welfare and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fellow Creatures.</p>
            <p>Whatever Means, therefore, are moſt effectual in curbing and <hi>ſubduing</hi> the ſelfiſh <hi>Deſires</hi> of Man, are the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Means of <hi>regulating</hi> his <hi>Actions,</hi> and eſtabliſhing civil Liberty on its moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Foundations.</p>
            <p>The mere coercive Power of human Laws, without an aſſiſtant Regulation of the Paſſions and Deſires, is utterly inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the great Ends either of <hi>private</hi> Happineſs or <hi>public</hi> Liberty.</p>
            <p>It cannot produce <hi>private</hi> Happineſs to the Individual, becauſe while it leaves his Mind open to be <hi>infeſted</hi> by every <hi>unruly</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0043801700:26"/>
               <hi>Paſſion</hi> that may ariſe, it <hi>forbids</hi> him the <hi>Gratification:</hi> Thus it ſets the diſtracted Soul at Variance with itſelf. The beſt Conſequence that can be hoped for, is a continued Conflict of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Appetite;</hi> of a <hi>Dread</hi> of human <hi>Laws,</hi> warring with inordinate and <hi>ſelſiſh Paſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be a <hi>permanent</hi> Foundation of public Liberty; becauſe while the Paſſions are thus left without an inward Controul, they will often be too ſtrong for <hi>Fear,</hi> even where a legal Puniſhment is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conſequence: For as they are ſuffered to ſubſiſt in their full Vigour, and when kindled in the Soul are blind and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, they will often carry away the whole Man; will bear him down in their Gratification, even to unavoidable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Still farther, and chiefly: Human Power cannot penetrate the ſecret Receſſes of the Soul, nor reach the dark Intentions of the Heart of Man, nor always be of Weight to combat the Strength of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0043801700:27"/>
Hence <hi>Cunning</hi> will often <hi>evade,</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> will often <hi>defy,</hi> the coercive Power of the beſt-formed Laws. Thus <hi>public Wiſdom</hi> muſt give Way to <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gratification,</hi> the <hi>Innocent</hi> muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Prey</hi> to the <hi>Guilty;</hi> that is, in other Words, <hi>Liberty</hi> muſt be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> muſt <hi>triumph.</hi>

            <head>SECT. V. Virtuous Manners and Principles the only permanent Foundation of civil Liberty.</head>
            <p>WHAT, then, are the <hi>permanent Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> on which perfect Liberty can ariſe?—I anſwer, it can only ariſe on the Power of ſuch a Syſtem of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> effectually impreſſed on the human Mind, as may be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Curb</hi> to every inordinate Deſire; or rather, ſuch as may ſo frame and model the Human Heart, that its ruling Deſires
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0043801700:28"/>
may correſpond, coincide, or coaleſce, with all the great and eſſential Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of public Law.</p>
            <p>The Nature of Man admits of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, though not in a perfect, yet in a conſiderable Degree. He is born with Appetites ſuited to his own Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the Continuance of his Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: Beyond this, he is by Nature at once <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> and <hi>ſocial; compaſſionate</hi> and <hi>reſentful; docile,</hi> either to <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil;</hi> and hence, capable of acquiring <hi>new Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> new Paſſions, new Deſires, either to the <hi>Welfare</hi> or <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of his Fellow-Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virtuous Manners</hi> I call ſuch acquired Habits of Thought and correſpondent Action, as lead to a ſteady Proſecution of the general Welfare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virtuous Principles</hi> I call ſuch as tend to confirm theſe Habits, by ſuperinducing the Idea of <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Virtuous Manners are a permanent Foundation for civil Liberty, becauſe they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0043801700:29"/>
lead the Paſſions and Deſires themſelves to coincide with the Appointments of public Law. The infant Mind is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a Variety of Paſſions: But it is in the Power of thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Education of Youth, in a conſiderable Degree, to determine the Bent of the naſcent Paſſions; to fix them on ſalutary Objects, or let them looſe to ſuch as are pernicious or deſtructive.</p>
            <p>Here, then, lie the firſt Foundations of civil Liberty: In forming the Habits of the youthful Heart, to a <hi>Coincidence</hi> with the <hi>general Welfare:</hi> In checking every riſing Appetite that is contrary to This, and in forwarding every Paſſion that may promote the Happineſs of the Community: In implanting and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benevolence, Self-Controul, Humility, Integrity, and Truth; in preventing or ſuppreſſing the contrary Habits of Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Intemperance, Pride, Diſhoneſty, and Falſehood: In teaching the young Mind to <hi>delight,</hi> as far as is poſſible, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0043801700:30"/>
every Virtue for its own Sake: In a Word, in ſo forming the Pleaſures and Diſpleaſures of the opening Heart, that they may coaleſce and harmonize with the Laws of public Freedom.</p>
            <p>Above all, <hi>This</hi> will give Stability to civil Liberty, if the ſocial Paſſions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals can be ſo far extended, as to include the Welfare of the <hi>whole</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as their <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>primary</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This Affection is diſtinguiſhed by the Name of <hi>public Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>Country;</hi> the higheſt Paſſion that can ſway the human Heart, conſidered as a permanent Foundation of true Liberty.</p>
            <p>But in ſome Minds the ſelfiſh Paſſions are ſtrong, and the ſocial ones weak or wanting: And in the beſt formed Heart incidental Temptations may ariſe, and overturn its pre-eſtabliſhed Habits: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a neceſſary Meaſure for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of private Virtue and public Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that <hi>virtuous Principles</hi> be likewiſe implanted in the Heart. Such Principles,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0043801700:31"/>
I mean, as may <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the good Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Thought and Action already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by ſuperinducing the Idea of <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe there are but <hi>three,</hi> which can ſway the Manners of Men, and confirm the Foundation of civil Liberty. Theſe are <hi>Religion, Honour,</hi> and natural <hi>Conſcience.</hi> The firſt has the <hi>Deity</hi> for its Object; the ſecond, the <hi>Applauſe</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> the third, the <hi>Approbation</hi> of our own <hi>Heart.</hi> The Frame and Situation of Man admits of no other <hi>Principle,</hi> from whence the Idea of <hi>Duty</hi> can ariſe.</p>
            <p>The Principle of <hi>Religion</hi> tends to this End of confirming civil Liberty, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Idea of <hi>Duty;</hi> and urges the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, on the Belief of a juſt, omnipotent, and all-ſeeing GOD; who approves and condemns, will reward or puniſh, according as our Thoughts and Actions are Good or Evil.</p>
            <p>But, as the Means of rendering <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> a firm <hi>Ally</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0043801700:32"/>
it is neceſſary that their <hi>Dictates</hi> ſhould be <hi>coincident:</hi> That is, that the Thoughts and Actions which Religion preſcribes as Duties, and forbids as Sins, ſhould coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with the Dictates and Appointments of public Law. In free Countries, this is the natural State of Religion; which commonly either bends to the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Community, or moulds them into its own Genius and Complexion.</p>
            <p>The Principle of <hi>Honour</hi> affords a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant Support of civil Liberty, when properly directed. It works by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and univerſal Paſſion, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"our Fondneſs for the Applauſe of Men:"</q> But in free Countries, this Principle is much more liable to abuſe than that of Religion: Becauſe it is apt be be warped by the faſhionable and ruling Manners of the Times: For whatever is faſhionable is apt to draw Reſpect and Applauſe: Whatever is unfaſhionable is for the preſent intitled only to Contempt. Hence the Principle of <hi>Honour</hi> becomes <hi>fluctuating</hi> and <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0043801700:33"/>
in its Nature, and therefore in its <hi>Effects:</hi> A <hi>Regulation</hi> of this Principle, therefore, is of the moſt important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; becauſe, if left to its own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic Dictates, it will often <hi>endanger</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> the Foundations of public Freedom.</p>
            <p>The third Principle, that of natural <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which tends to confirm the Eſtabliſhment of Liberty, is founded in the Approbation of our own Heart. This Principle is in one Reſpect independent on the other two, but in another Reſpect ſeems to ſtand intimately related to them. It is independent of them, as it neither looks out for the Approbation of God, nor the Applauſe of Men: It ſeems inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately related to them, becauſe on a ſtrict Examination of the human Frame, as well as the Hiſtory of Mankind, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears generally to be the Reſult of the <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> or <hi>both.</hi> We tranſplant the acknowledged <hi>Approbation</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>Applauſe</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> into our own <hi>Heart;</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0043801700:34"/>
and from this, through the fertile Power of <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> ſprings a new Principle of <hi>Self-Approbation</hi> and <hi>Self-Reproof,</hi> as an additional <hi>Regulator</hi> of our Thoughts and Actions.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, many Writers have reſolved the <hi>particular</hi> Dictates of natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into an <hi>unchangeable</hi> Principle of Right and Wrong, ariſing univerſally in the human Heart. There is no Doubt, but the <hi>general</hi> Principle of Self-Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or Self-Rebuke ariſeth in an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> Manner, in ſome Degree or other: But as it appears from the Hiſtory of human Nature, that the <hi>particular</hi> Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of this Conſcience <hi>vary</hi> with the other received Principles of the Mind, it is not neceſſary to debate or dwell on this ſpeculative Point: We may take it as a Truth confirmed by Facts, that the <hi>particular</hi> Dictates of natural <hi>Conſcience</hi> will generally be founded on thoſe of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0043801700:35"/>
Hence, then, it appears, that this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Conſcience ſtands in Need of a <hi>Guide,</hi> in the ſame Degree as thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which it is founded. If it be founded on the <hi>Religion</hi> of a free State, it will generally <hi>coincide</hi> with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Freedom:</hi> If its Foundations are laid in the mere Principle of <hi>Honour,</hi> its Dictates will be <hi>fantaſtic</hi> as thoſe of its Parent; and will therefore require a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel <hi>Regulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Each of theſe Principles, ſingly taken, is of Power, in <hi>ſome</hi> Degree or other, to ſtrengthen the Baſis of civil Liberty. On their <hi>united</hi> Influence, added to the Force of pre-eſtabliſhed Habits of Thought and Manners, public Freedom might ſeem to ariſe on immoveable and everlaſting Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>But as the Nature of Man, even in his moſt virtuous State, is <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent;</hi> ſo, in Spite of the moſt ſalutary Inſtitutions, ſome <hi>Defects</hi> will intrude. Hence, from an unavoidable Alloy of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0043801700:36"/>
Vice, civil Liberty muſt ever be <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi> A certain Degree of Licentiouſneſs (that is, of private Will, oppoſing the Public) will always mix itſelf, and in ſome Degree contaminate the Purity of every Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Yet, while virtuous Manners and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples clearly predominate in their Effects, a State may ſtill be juſtly called <hi>free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in Proportion as theſe Manners and Principles decay, and their Contraries riſe into Power and Action, public Freedom muſt neceſſarily decline.

            <head>SECT. VI. An Objection conſidered.</head>
            <p>DOubtleſs, it will be objected (nay, it <hi>hath</hi> been objected) by the Patrons of unlimited Freedom of Thought, that This is indeed a Syſtem of <hi>Slavery;</hi> that it is building civil Liberty on the <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and ſhackling the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Soul with <hi>early Prejudice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this plauſible Objection, the Writer replies (what he hath elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where advanced <note n="*" place="bottom">Sermons on Education, &amp;c. p. 62, &amp;c.</note> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That a Prejudice doth not imply, as is generally ſuppoſed, the Falſehood of the Opinion inſtilled, but only that it is taken up, and held, without its proper Evidence. Thus the infant Mind may be prejudiced in Favour of <hi>Truth</hi> as well as <hi>Falſehood;</hi> and neither can the one or the other, thus inſtilled, be properly called more than an <hi>Opinion."</hi>

Farther: The infant Mind cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a State of Indifference and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, either with Regard to Habits of Conduct, or Principles and Opinions. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, Impreſſions, Beliefs, Principles, of one Kind or other, the growing Mind will inevitably contract, from its Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Mankind: If therefore rational Habits and Principles be not infuſed, in order to preclude Abſurdities; it is Odds, but Abſurdities will get the Start, and preclude all rational Habits and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The Paſſions and the Reaſon of a Child will put themſelves in Action, however wretched and inconſiſtent; in the ſame Manner, as his Limbs will make an Effort towards <hi>walking,</hi> however awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and abſurd. The ſame Objection, therefore, that lies againſt inſtilling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary Habits and Principles, will ariſe againſt teaching him to <hi>walk erect:</hi> This being indeed a Violation of the natural <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> as the other is of the natural <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Paſſions and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0043801700:39"/>
the <hi>Mind.</hi> The Conſequences, too, are of the ſame Nature: For ſure, a Child left to the Direction of his own Appetites and Reaſon would ſtand the ſame Chance to grovel in Abſurdities, as to crawl on Hands and Knees, and wallow in the Mire.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any Difference, with Reſpect to the real and internal Freedom of the Mind, between <hi>Opinions inſtilled,</hi> and <hi>Opinions caught by Accident.</hi> For in Truth, the Mind cannot be <hi>compelled</hi> to receive any Habit of Thought, Principle, or Opinion. Theſe may indeed be offered to the infant Mind, but the Reception of them is its own voluntary Act; and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſo, whether they be preſented by fortuitous Incidents, or deſigned Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All the Difference is, that in the firſt Caſe ſuch a Syſtem of Habits and Opinions will certainly ariſe, as tend to the Deſtruction of Society: In the ſecond, ſuch a Syſtem of Habits and Opinions may be infuſed into the free Mind, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0043801700:40"/>
will lay a ſure and laſting Foundation of public Liberty and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Nay, if any Difference could ariſe, with Reſpect to the true <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>Mind;</hi> ſurely, <hi>That Mind</hi> ought, in the Eye of Reaſon, to be adjudged <hi>moſt free,</hi> which adopts a Syſtem of Thought and Action, founded on the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the agreeing <hi>Society;</hi> rather than <hi>That</hi> which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be incurably tainted with the <hi>vague</hi> and <hi>random</hi> Conceptions of <hi>untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor'd Infancy.—</hi>This, at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the old Stoic Principle, that <q rend="inline">"The wiſe Man alone is free. <note n="*" place="bottom">Solus Sapiens liber.</note>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Much hath been ſaid in our Times, indeed, concerning the Force of <hi>unaſſiſted</hi> human <hi>Reaſon:</hi> The Writer would not willingly either flatter or degrade its Powers. But to Him it appears, that they are ſuperficially informed of the Frame and Tenor of the human Mind, who think that <hi>mere Reaſon</hi> (as it exiſts in Man) is more than a Power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0043801700:41"/>
and chuſing the <hi>propereſt Means</hi> for obtaining his <hi>deſired Ends,</hi> whether theſe Ends be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil.</hi> The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, pre-eſtabliſhed Habits, and infuſed Principles of the Soul are the univerſal Motives to human Action. Where theſe point not to an <hi>End deſired,</hi> Reaſon may indolently exerciſe its Eye; but can never find nor create an Object, of Force ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to put the Powers of the Soul and Body in Motion. Hence, human Reaſon muſt always receive its particular Caſt and Colour from the pre-eſtabliſhed Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Habits, and Principles; will ever form its ruling Ideas of Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, Juſt and Unjuſt, from theſe great Fountains of human Action.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of human Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this Truth: Hence it is, that this boaſted human Reaſon is indeed ſo poor and unprofitable a Poſſeſſion; being warped and moulded into that particular Form, which the varying Accidents of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, Soil, eſtabliſhed Manners, Religion,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0043801700:42"/>
Policy, bodily Frame, or prevailing Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Principles, chance to give it.</p>
            <p>Hence, then, it appears, that the private Freedom of the infant Mind is not <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi> but only <hi>directed</hi> to its <hi>beſt End,</hi> by early and ſalutary Inſtruction. Hence it appears to be the proper Deſtination of Man, that he ſhall not be left to the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of his own weak Underſtanding and naſcent Paſſions; that he ſhall not be left <hi>fortuitouſly</hi> to imbibe the Maxims of corrupt Times and Manners; Maxims which, ſetting aſide all Regard to their ſpeculative Truth or Falſehood, do lead to the Diſſolution of Law and Freedom: But that he ſhall be conducted voluntarily to adopt thoſe Habits and Principles, which have been conſecrated by the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt and wiſeſt Men, in every Age and Nation; ſuch, in particular, as are ſuitable to the Laws, the Cuſtoms, the Genius, of his own free Country; ſuch, in a Word, as are a <hi>ſecure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of <hi>public Liberty.</hi>

            <head>SECT. VII. A Confirmation of theſe Principles, drawn from the Hiſtory of free States.</head>
            <head>1ſt. Of Sparta.</head>
            <p>THESE Reaſonings, founded on the Nature and Conſtitution of Man, will receive a ſtrong and unanſwerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the Hiſtory of free States. Hence we ſhall obtain the cleareſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Fact, that while virtuous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Principles retained their Efficacy and Power, civil Liberty remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken: That as theſe decayed, Liberty declined: That as ſoon as theſe were loſt, Liberty was no more; Licentiouſneſs crept in; Faction triumphed; and overwhelmed theſe degenerate States in one common Ruin.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe I ſhall briefly analyze the Genius of the three moſt eminent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0043801700:44"/>
               <hi>Republics</hi> that are recorded in Story: Thoſe of SPARTA, ATHENS, and ROME. The Events are ſufficiently known to thoſe who are converſant in ancient Hiſtory: But the fundamental and leading <hi>Cauſes</hi> of theſe Events deſerve a particular Inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation: They will form a concurrent Proof of the Principles here given.</p>
            <p>The Republic of SPARTA claims the firſt Place; both on Account of its Antiquity, and Perfection. By its Perfection is meant, not the moral Perfection of its <hi>particular Inſtitutions,</hi> but of the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> by which <hi>Theſe</hi> Inſtitutions were ſecured.</p>
            <p>The leading Inſtitutions which LYCUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUS fixed as the Eſſence of his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, were theſe which follow.</p>
            <p>1. He eſtabliſhed a Senate of <hi>twenty-eight,</hi> as an <hi>intermediate Power</hi> between that of <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People...</hi> 2. He made an equal Partition of Lands and Goods, among the free Members of the Community... 3. He introduced the Uſe of Iron Money, inſtead of Gold and Silver... 4. He baniſhed or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0043801700:45"/>
prevented all the Arts of Commerce, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and Luxury... 5. He ordained, that all the Members of the Society ſhould eat together, and partake alike of the ſame coarſe Fare... 6. He eſtabliſhed an occaſional Community of Wives: So that a Wife was not ſo much the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of her Huſband, as of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, to the End of Population... 7. With a parallel View, he ordained a Kind of Community of Children: By This, no Father had the Care of his own Child; which, on its Birth, was immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to the Officers of the State; and was either preſerved or deſtroyed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Decree... 8. A conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Attention to the Preſervation of the State, and an unremitted Preparation and Readineſs for defenſive War, formed the chief Employment of the <hi>Spartan</hi> State... 9. He committed the Cultivation of their Lands to a large Body of Slaves, who dwelt in the ſurrounding Country, were deprived of all the natural Rights
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0043801700:46"/>
of Men, and were often laid in Wait for, and butchered in cold Blood by the young Men of SPARTA. <note n="*" place="bottom">This Enormity, practiſed with Impunity by the young Men of Sparta, hath been held unaccountable: But ſeems to have been allowed on the ſame warlike Principle with That other Allowance <q rend="inline">"of ſtealing Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals."</q> Both were probably eſtabliſhed as the Means of preparing them for the Exerciſe of <hi>Stratagem</hi> in War.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the public and eſſential In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Spartan Republic: Many of them ſtrange in their Nature: Yet formed for long Duration, through the Means and Principles on which they were eſtabliſhed: Which we ſhall find to be conſiſtent with, and corroborative of the Principles of civil Liberty above laid down.</p>
            <p>The firſt and beſt Security of civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, hath been ſhewn to conſiſt <q rend="inline margQuotes">"in impreſſing the infant Mind with ſuch Habits of Thought and Action, as may correſpond with and promote the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of public Law."</q>—This Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity was laid by LYCURGUS, in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0043801700:47"/>
deepeſt and moſt effectual Manner, by the Mode of <hi>Education</hi> which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Youth.</p>
            <p>No Father had a Right to educate his Children according to the Caprice of his own Fancy. They were delivered to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Officers, who initiated them early in the Manners, the Maxims, the Exerciſes, the Toils, in a Word, in all the mental and bodily Acquirements and Habits, which <hi>correſponded</hi> with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>State.</hi> Family Connexions had no Place: The firſt and leading Object of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, was the general Welfare. This Tuition was carefully continued, till they were enrolled in the Liſt of <hi>Men:</hi> To ſecure the Manners thus acquired, they were prohibited from travelling into other Countries, leſt they ſhould catch Infection from ill Example: On the ſame Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all Viſits from Strangers were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. <note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch: in Lycurgo.</note> Thus were they ſtrongly and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0043801700:48"/>
unalterably poſſeſſed with the <hi>Love</hi> of their <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſevere Manners were confirmed by all the Principles that could ſtrengthen them in the Mind of Man.</p>
            <p>The Principle of <hi>Religion</hi> laid at the very Foundation of the State: For LY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURGUS expreſsly modeled his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth on the Pretence of a divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. He declared to the People, that its eſſential Inſtitutions were given him by the Oracle of DELPHI, which he went on Purpoſe to conſult. <note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch: in Lycurgo.</note> Again, after he had modeled his Republic, he repaired once more to the ſacred Tripod; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"whether the God approved of the Laws he had eſtabliſhed."</q> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was in the Affirmative: And this Reply LYCURGUS ſent to SPARTA. <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This Principle was ſo intimately blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with that of the State, that their <hi>Kings</hi> were at the ſame Time the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> of the Community. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib.</note>—The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0043801700:49"/>
and Power of an Oath was ſo ſtrongly impreſſed on their Minds, that LYCURGUS truſted the future Execution of his Laws, to <hi>That</hi> Oath which the People took, on his laſt Departure from the City: <note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch: in Lycurgo.</note>—An Oath, which proves, that the Religion of the Country was not at Variance with the Appointments of the State; becauſe it obliged them never to depart from the Inſtitutions of LYCURGUS.</p>
            <p>The Principle of <hi>Honour</hi> was not at Variance, but <hi>co-operated</hi> with and <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> That of <hi>Religion.</hi> PLUTARCH is very particular, on their early and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Encouragement of this Principle. Their Songs (which made a Part of their Education) tended to inflame their Minds with honeſt Ambition. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Their Subject was generally the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of ſuch Men as had dy'd in Defence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; or in <hi>Deriſion</hi> of Thoſe who had ſhrunk from the public Service. The <hi>old</hi> Men talked high of what they had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0043801700:50"/>
done: The <hi>younger</hi> Part echo'd back their Song; declaring their Reſolution, not to diſgrace the Valour of their Forefathers. <note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch: in Lycurgo.</note>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Principle of natural <hi>Conſcience</hi> was ſo intimately interwoven with thoſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> that it affords a ſtriking Proof how far natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience depends on theſe other Principles. If natural Conſcience were in itſelf a well-regulated and <hi>ſufficient Guide;</hi> could any Thing have been more odious to its Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, than <hi>Proſtitution, Adultery, Thieving,</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſſination?</hi> Yet all theſe did the ſevere <hi>Spartans</hi> practiſe, not only <hi>without Remorſe,</hi> but with <hi>Self-Approbation;</hi> the infant Mind being before-hand modeled to this <hi>prepoſterous</hi> Syſtem of <hi>imagined Duty.</hi> For, on the very ruling Principles of the State, their Daughters were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, their Wives were common, their Victuals were ſtolen, their Slaves were murdered. <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0043801700:51"/>
Thus was the famed Republic of <hi>Sparta</hi> ſtrongly fortify'd, by the united and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Power of <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> all pointing to the <hi>ſame</hi> End, the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>State:</hi> Of Manners and Principles, which in their particular Application, ſeemed to ſacrifice the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Individuals to the Preſervation of the Whole: And while they were moſt <hi>abhorrent</hi> from the Maxims of <hi>improved</hi> human Nature, <hi>ſecured</hi> the Inſtitutions of a <hi>ſavage</hi> Policy.</p>
            <p>From this View of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, theſe farther Remarks may naturally ariſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It hath been Matter of Surprize to thoſe who have written on this famed Republic, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"by what Means LYCURGUS ſhould be able to perſwade the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> not only to change the Form of their Government, but to quit their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Poſſeſſions, their Manner of Life, the Uſe of Money, the Advantages of Commerce, the Property of their Wives,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0043801700:52"/>
the Care of their Children; and adopt a contrary Syſtem, ſo abhorrent from the Deſires of civilized Man."</q> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſuppoſing the <hi>Fact,</hi> it ſhould ſeem a Paradox utterly unaccountable.—The true Solution ſeems of a quite different Nature.—PLUTARCH leads me to it.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"There is ſo much Uncertainty (ſaith he) in the Accounts which Hiſtorians have left us of LYCURGUS, that ſcarce any Thing is aſſerted by one, which is not contradicted by others. Their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are quite different as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he came of, the Voyages he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, the Place and Manner of his Death: But moſt of all, when they ſpeak of the Laws he made, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth he founded.—They cannot be brought to agree, as to the very <hi>Age</hi> when he lived.—TIMAEUS conjectures, that there were two of his Name, and in different Times; but that the one being more famous than the other, Men gave to Him the Glory of both their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0043801700:53"/>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch: in Lycurgo.</note>"</q>—Hence it appears, that the true Hiſtory of this Lawgiver was loſt in the Darkneſs of fabulous and obſcure Ages: And that, as to the Beginnings of this Commonwealth, we have nothing to depend on, but the traditionary Rumours of a barbarous and lying Period. Now this ſeems to be fairly weighed down by the internal Evidence ariſing from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Eſtabliſhment itſelf. For it was indeed <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Eſtabliſhment of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Manners, carried into Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency by political Inſtitutions."</q> That Mankind ſhould be <hi>carry'd back</hi> to <hi>This,</hi> from a State of <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—</hi>that they ſhould quit private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, Money, Commerce, Decency, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic Comforts, Wives and Children, and give them up to the Poſſeſſion of the Public, is a Contradiction to all the known Powers and Paſſions of the human Mind. To effect a <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Government only,</hi> is a Work ſufficient for the Abilities of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0043801700:54"/>
the greateſt Legiſlator: But to overturn all the pre-eſtabliſhed Habits of the Head and Heart, to deſtroy or reverſe all the fixed Aſſociations, Maxims, Manners, and Principles, of a whole civilized Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; were a Labour, which might well be ranked among the moſt extravagant Legends of fabulous GREECE.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, to <hi>bring forward</hi> a Tribe of untaught Savages <hi>one Degree</hi> towards <hi>Civilization,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> to <hi>fix</hi> them;—to aſſign equal Portions of Land to thoſe among whom Lands laid in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;—to introduce Iron Money, where <hi>no Money</hi> had been in Uſe;—to prohibit Commerce, where Commerce was almoſt unknown;—to make the Girls dance naked in Public, where they had never known the decent Uſe of Cloaths;—to allow of Theft and Homicide under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Limitations, where <hi>Both</hi> had been practiſed without Limitation;—to make Wives at Times a public Property, where promiſcuous Concubinage had prevailed;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0043801700:55"/>
to give Children a public Education, where no Education had taken Place;—Theſe might all ſeem the natural and practicable Efforts of a <hi>Pagan</hi> Legiſlator.</p>
            <p>Thus, the Formation of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Republic ſeems clearly accounted for. A Tribe of untaught Savages, were brought forward by LYCURGUS one Degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Civilization and Humanity, and There fixed by ſevere Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The Fate of AGIS, their patriot King, confirms this Solution. He, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of public Virtue ſeldom ſeen in any Station, attempted to bring back the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt State to its firſt rigorous Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But That which LYCURGUS could eſtabliſh among untaught Savages, AGIS found impracticable, among a corrupted People. He was ſeized, impriſoned, and murdered by a Faction, in his Attempt to reſtore Freedom to a degenerate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Argument here alledged be juſt, concerning the firſt Inſtitution of this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0043801700:56"/>
Republic; it follows (what, indeed, ſeems probable in its own Nature) that the ſtrongeſt political Inſtitutions may be formed on the ſavage State of Man. In this Period the Legiſlator hath few or no prior Inſtitutions to contend with; and therefore can form a Syſtem of Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſtent with itſelf in all its Parts. While the Lawgiver who reforms a State already modeled and corrupted, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with ſuch partial Regulations, as the Force of prior Eſtabliſhments and public Habits will admit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The long united State of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public afford a Proof againſt a political Maxim commonly received, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are neceſſary to a free State; and that inward Tranquillity is a certain Symptom of its approaching Ruin."</q> For, from the Hiſtory of SPARTA, it appears, that during the Space of at leaſt five hundred Years, inteſtine Diviſions were unknown.

Writers <note n="*" place="bottom">Among others, by MACHIAVEL and MONTES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUIEU.</note>) hath been founded on a Suppoſition, that where Opinion is <hi>free,</hi> it muſt ever be <hi>divided.</hi> The <hi>Spartan</hi> Commonwealth preſents a clear Proof of the Reverſe: That Opinion may be <hi>free,</hi> yet ſtill <hi>united.</hi> But this <hi>free Union</hi> can only be the happy Effect of an early and rigorous Education; by which the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Minds of the Community are volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily led, by public Inſtitutions, into <hi>one common Channel</hi> of <hi>Habit, Principle,</hi> and <hi>Action. . .</hi> PLUTARCH tells us, that the Effect of this entire Union was ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in SPARTA, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth reſembled <hi>one</hi> great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſon, <hi>actuated by one Soul,</hi> rather than a State compoſed of <hi>many</hi> Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals. <note n="†" place="bottom">In Lycurgo.</note>"</q>
            </p>

The Power of Manners and Maxims thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed was ſo untractable, even in the declining Periods of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that PHILOPAEMEN, after many fruitleſs Attempts to annihilate its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, declared, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that the only effectual Method of deſtroying SPARTA, muſt be in <hi>diſſolving</hi> the <hi>Education</hi> of their <hi>Youth.</hi>

            <p>The firſt and ruling Defect in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Republic ſeems to have been <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the total Want of an eſtabliſhed Education, ſuited to the Genius of the State."</q> There appears not to have been any public, regular, or preſcribed Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of this Kind, beyond what Cuſtom had accidentally introduced.

            <p>LET us now paſs to a Review of the Commonwealth of ROME: In the Hiſtory and Fate of which, we ſhall find moſt abundant Proof of the Truths here laid down, concerning the Power of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Principles, in the Preſervation or the Diſſolution of public Freedom.</p>
            <p>MONTESQUIEU remarks finely, in his Diſcourſe on this Republic, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"more States have periſhed, thro' a Violation of Manners, than thro' a Violation of Laws <note n="*" place="bottom">Grandeur, &amp;c.</note>"</q> The Reaſon (though he does not aſſign it) appears evident on the Principles here given. He who violates eſtabliſhed <hi>Manners,</hi> ſtrikes at the general <hi>Foundation;</hi> he who violates <hi>Law,</hi> ſtrikes only at a particular Part of the <hi>Superſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0043801700:69"/>
In the Republic of SPARTA, we have ſeen the original State of Manners and Principles conſpiring ſtrongly to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> of the Republic: In that of ATHENS, we have ſeen the original State of Manners and Principles tending no leſs clearly to its <hi>Diſſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In analyſing the original State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Principles in the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, we ſhall find a different and <hi>intermediate</hi> State of Things; mixing the <hi>Strength</hi> of the <hi>Spartan,</hi> with the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Inſtitutions; tending firſt to <hi>enlarge</hi> and <hi>aggrandize</hi> the Republic, and in the End to <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> it.</p>
            <p>The Manners and Principles of early ROME, which tended to enlarge and aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize the Republic, were 1. A <hi>Love</hi> of their <hi>Country</hi> inſtilled into their riſing Youth: Formed chiefly on the Power of <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> and more particularly on the <hi>warlike</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the State. Their Annals abound with ſo many Inſtances of this grand Paſſion, that preſent Times ſtand amazed, and with Difficulty credit their Story.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0043801700:70"/>
2. This Paſſion, founded on an <hi>early,</hi> though <hi>not</hi> a <hi>preſcribed</hi> Education, was ſo ſtrengthened by their <hi>religious</hi> Syſtem, that till the fatal Entrance of the Doctrine of EPICURUS, no <hi>Roman</hi> was ever known to have violated his Oath. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Monteſq. Grand. des Rom. C. x. Polyb. L. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Their Principle of <hi>Honour</hi> coincided with that of their Religion. It was ſo ſtrong, at the Time of the firſt Formation of the Republic, that the Puniſhment of <hi>Diſgrace</hi> was judged ſufficient to deter the People from a Violation of the Laws. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"When a Delinquent was cited before the People (ſaith LIVY) the <hi>Valerian</hi> Law ordained only, that he ſhould be branded as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Liv. Hiſt. L. 10.</note>"</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. From the Truths laid down above, it appears, that the Principle of natural <hi>Conſcience</hi> muſt of Courſe co-operate with theſe, for the Confirmation of civil Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Force of this Principle is no leſs conſpicuous in the early Periods of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0043801700:71"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty: It aroſe even into a fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pride of Virtue, independent of all outward Teſtimony, which hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the great Names of ancient ROME, from Thoſe of every other People upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To theſe we muſt add the <hi>Equality</hi> of Property, the <hi>Mediocrity</hi> of Poſſeſſion, the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of Life, which prevailed in early ROME; all theſe were the Outworks that guarded the internal Strength of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Principles; and ſeemed, like the Inſtitutions of SPARTA, to promiſe an Eternity of Freedom.</p>
            <p>But in Spite of all theſe Foundations of civil Liberty, there were three fatal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, admitted into the very Eſſence of the Republic, which contained the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>certain Ruin:</hi> While the <hi>Tree</hi> ſeemed to <hi>flouriſh</hi> in its full Growth and Vigour, <hi>Theſe,</hi> like <hi>Canker-Worms,</hi> lay <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at the Root.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe was the Neglect of inſtituting public Laws, by which the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0043801700:72"/>
               <hi>Education</hi> of their Children might have been <hi>aſcertained.</hi> This is juſtly charged by PLUTARCH, as a capital Defect in NUMA's Legiſlation: <note n="*" place="bottom">See above, Sect. vii.</note> This Defect, when once admitted into the Eſſence of the State, could not eaſily be rectify'd in ſucceeding Times: The Principle could only have been effectually infuſed, at the general Formation of the whole Maſs. In Conſequence of this Error in the firſt Concoction, the ſupporting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Freedom were vague and fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating: For Want of this <hi>preventing</hi> Power, the incidental Vices of a Parent were naturally tranſmitted to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thence to future Ages. The rigorous Education of SPARTA was a ſtrong Check to the Proneneſs of human Nature towards Degeneracy and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Through This, every incidental Vice dy'd with its firſt Poſſeſſor: While the more lax Inſtitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, ſuffered every original Taint in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0043801700:73"/>
and Principles to be transfuſed into, and to contaminate ſucceeding Times.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of theſe was <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>unlimited Conqueſt."</hi>
               </q> Their early Paſſion for War aroſe from their <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> On their firſt Eſtabliſhment, they had neither <hi>Territory</hi> nor <hi>Commerce:</hi> They lived by <hi>Plunder:</hi> Hence, the <hi>ruling Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> was <hi>warlike:</hi> Their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Genius was <hi>unchecked</hi> by any other Principle: Hence, unremitted Exerciſes, unceaſing Improvements in Diſcipline, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Valour and Ferocity aroſe. Thus they attempted to ſubdue, and thus they ſubdued the World.</p>
            <p>But ſuch an Empire is utterly <hi>untena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Valour</hi> may <hi>acquire,</hi> but cannot <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> it. The <hi>Body</hi> of ſuch a State is too enormous to be effectually animated by the <hi>Soul.</hi> This is a Cauſe of Ruin ſo clear, that it hath met every Writer's Obſervation; and therefore needs no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0043801700:74"/>
The third Principle of inevitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which ſeems to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought into the very Eſſence of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Republic, was the fatal Principle of <hi>Change:</hi> This is a Cauſe not ſo obvious; and therefore may require a farther Inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation.</p>
            <p>MONTESQUIEU hath juſtly obſerved, that one Cauſe of the <hi>Roman Greatneſs</hi> was <q rend="inline margQuotes">"their <hi>adopting</hi> any Inſtitution or Cuſtom of other Nations whom they conquer'd, provided it was better than their own. <note n="*" place="bottom">Grandeur, &amp;c. C. i. ii.</note>"</q> It ſeems to have eſcaped the Obſervation of this great Writer, that the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Adoption,</hi> carried through every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the Republic, led the Way to its final <hi>Ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For altho' in the early Periods, when Manners were ſimple, and concurrent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were ſtrong, this Spirit of <hi>Adoption</hi> was confined to Cuſtoms that were <hi>better</hi> than their own; yet in the ſucceeding Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0043801700:75"/>
when Manners grew more relaxed, and Principles were weakened, the ſame Spirit of <hi>Adoption</hi> opened a Door for the Admiſſion of <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> that were <hi>pernicious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Admiſſion of <hi>Change,</hi> which in the virtuous Ages led to the <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> in ſucceeding Times brought on the <hi>Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Republic.</p>
            <p>The ſagacious Romans ſoon found the Conſequences of this Defect: They ſaw, that through a Want of original, <hi>preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and ſalutary Inſtitutions, bad Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were creeping inſenſibly on the State. Hence the Creation of the <hi>Cenſors</hi> had its Riſe: An Office, which immediately took Cognizance of the Manners of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this high Office was ineffectual in its End; becauſe it had not Power univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to <hi>prevent, but</hi> only in Part to <hi>remedy</hi> the Evil. Hence, while <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>detected Offences</hi> only, could be puniſhed by the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of the People were laid open to a <hi>general Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0043801700:76"/>
from the fatal Principle of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> and <hi>Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Danger ariſing from this Principle manifeſtly increaſed with the increaſing Empire: That <hi>Identity</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> of Manners and Principles, which is the Soul and Security of every free State, gave Way to Manners and Principles wholly <hi>diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> New Maxims of Life, new Principles of Religion and Irreligion, of Honour and Diſhonour, of Right and Wrong, picked up indiſcriminately among the Nations which they conquered, by Degrees infuſed themſelves into the Heads and Hearts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens.</p>

            <p>THOUGH the Study of Hiſtory be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inſtructive and uſeful, yet, in one Reſpect, it becomes the Source of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Error, even when it is written with Impartiality and Truth. This ariſeth from a miſtaken Application of hiſtorical Facts. Errors of this Kind are apt to creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Reaſonings, on every Subject, where Men and Manners are concerned: But they are liable to infect <hi>political</hi> Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, above all others.</p>
            <p>As the political Intereſts of Men form the principal Subject of Hiſtory, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner on this Subject hath Recourſe to Facts, as the beſt Support of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Yet, the Politician ſeems, of all others, moſt liable to be miſtaken in the Application of Hiſtory to his own
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0043801700:80"/>
Purpoſe; becauſe the political Connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and Intereſts of Men are, above all others, <hi>complicated</hi> and <hi>various.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, as no two political Conſtitutions were ever the <hi>ſame</hi> in <hi>all</hi> their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, though <hi>ſimilar</hi> in <hi>many;</hi> ſo, all Arguments drawn from a <hi>partial</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, muſt be inadequate and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive; unleſs when it appears, that no other Circumſtances took Place, by which That <hi>partial</hi> Reſemblance might be <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted,</hi> and its Effects deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Yet, it hath been a Practice too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among political Reaſoners, from a <hi>partial</hi> Reſemblance between two States, to infer a <hi>total</hi> one; and becauſe they have been <hi>like</hi> in <hi>ſome</hi> Reſpects, to draw Concluſions, as if they had been <hi>like</hi> in <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much Caution, therefore, is neceſſary, in the Application of hiſtorical Facts: Without This, we ſhall run into perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Error. Let us, then, remark ſome of the moſt <hi>eſſential</hi> Circumſtances, in which the Conſtitution of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> State
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0043801700:81"/>
differs from thoſe of SPARTA, ATHENS, and ROME; and then draw ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, as may be conſiſtent with theſe Diſtinctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may lay it down as a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truth generally acknowledged, that the <hi>political</hi> Conſtitution of GREAT BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN, in its <hi>main Outline,</hi> is <hi>better modeled</hi> than thoſe of SPARTA, ATHENS, or ROME. The legiſlative and executive Powers are more equally balanced, and more clearly diſtinguiſhed. Now, if Laws could ſupport themſelves, it would follow, that this political State muſt <hi>therefore</hi> be of <hi>longer Duration.</hi> But as it hath been made appear, that the Duration of free States depends not ſo much on their mere <hi>Form,</hi> as on the <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> which ſupport them; ſo, nothing can be decided concerning the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> State, from its mere <hi>external Model.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, eſtabliſhed in BRITAIN, is, in its own Nature, far
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0043801700:82"/>
ſuperior to that of theſe ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths. The abſolute Perfection and glorious Attributes of the Deity; the great Principle of univerſal Charity; the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Duties of Man to Man, thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting; the Sanctions of future Reward and Puniſhment; all theſe tend to purify and exalt the Soul, far beyond the Rites of ancient Paganiſm: For This, even in its beſt Forms, was ever built on the Hiſtory and Examples of deify'd Men, whoſe Lives had often been blotted with the moſt flagrant Crimes; and therefore, could never exalt the Heart of Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this weak Principle of Elevation.—But as the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>Religion</hi> depends, not only on its <hi>excellent Genius,</hi> but on its being <hi>effectually impreſſed</hi> on the Mind; ſo, no Conſequence can be juſtly drawn, from the mere <hi>un-apply'd</hi> Excellence of its Nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Self-Conſiſtence,</hi> and perfect <hi>Unity</hi> of Parts which diſtinguiſhed the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of SPARTA, cannot be expected nor
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0043801700:83"/>
found in that of BRITAIN. For the firſt was the entire Work of a ſingle Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſtruck out at one Heat; all its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions conſpiring to one End, and centering (like the Radii of a Circle) in one ſingle Point: To This, the outward Form of Government, the internal State of Education, of Religion, Manners and Principles, were uniformly ſubordinate. But at the Time of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> which was the firſt Aera of BRITAIN'S Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, many prior Inſtitutions and Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, both in Religion and Policy, Manners and Principles, had taken Place: Theſe had been formed on the fortuitous Events of Time; and had reſulted from a Variety of contending Parties; of <hi>Power,</hi> fluctuating at different Periods, between the <hi>Kings,</hi> the <hi>Nobles,</hi> the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and the <hi>People.</hi> All theſe it was impoſſible for human Art to remove and new-model, without ſhaking the State to its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Hence, though the Form of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Conſtitution, civil and religious, be of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0043801700:84"/>
unrivaled Excellence; yet in its very Birth it came attended with unalterable Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—It wanted that general Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, that entire Unity of Parts, as well as of eſtabliſhed Habits, Manners and Principles, ſuited to the Genius of the State, which was the very Spirit and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Commonwealth. In this Circumſtance, it appears likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth; yet, perhaps, ſuperior to that of <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Syſtem of Polity and Religion, perfect in its leading Parts, but imperfectly united and ſupported, is not upheld in its native Power (like that of SPARTA) by correſpondent and effectual Rules of Education. The Fundamental Laws of our Country, the Principles and Duties of Chriſtianity, are indeed occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally explained and taught, in a certain Manner and Degree: But it is in the Power of every Private Man to educate his Child, not only without a Reverence for Theſe, but in an abſolute Contempt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0043801700:85"/>
of them. It is much in every Parent's Option, whether he will impreſs his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Hearts with ſuch Habits and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as accord to the Genius of the State, or with Impunity ſuffer them to contract ſuch Manners and Opinions as tend to its Diſſolution. A Circumſtance pregnant with Danger to this free State: For hence, Manners and Principles, its chief Support, are liable to be incurably perverted in the Heart, at that Time of Life, in which alone they can be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually impreſſed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the important Circumſtance of <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Admiſſion of <hi>Change,"</hi>
               </q> or the <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Adoption,"</hi>
               </q> the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is contrary to That of SPARTA; and nearly on a Level with Thoſe of ATHENS and ROME.—Foreign Commerce, foreign Travel, new Manners, new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, new Modes of Dreſs, of Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of Luxury, are here adopted with a Degree of Avidity almoſt unbounded.—Happy would the Writer eſteem his

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The laſt Circumſtance of Note, here to be remarked, is <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Difference of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter among the ſeveral <hi>Ranks</hi> of the Community in theſe ancient free States, and That of <hi>Britain."</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In Point of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Ability,</hi> the Difference was great between the <hi>Nobles</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> in theſe ancient States: In BRITAIN, the <hi>Nobles</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> (in their <hi>legiſlative</hi> Capacity) are fairly on a <hi>Level.</hi> When ALCIBIADES addreſſed the legiſlative Body of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he addreſſed <hi>Coblers, Braſiers, Tanners, Tent-Makers.</hi> When the People of ROME retired in Diſcontent to the ſacred Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they were appeaſed by the Fable of the <hi>Belly, Head,</hi> and <hi>Hands.</hi> A <hi>Lord</hi> of Parliament would make but a ſorry Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,

            </p>
            <p>Again: In each of theſe ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, the collective Body of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> were much of one uniform Character; being Inhabitants of the ſame City, and nearly on a Level with Reſpect to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and Property. In ATHENS, they were all <hi>Artiſans</hi> or <hi>Tradeſmen:</hi> In SPARTA and ROME, they were all <hi>Soldiers.</hi> A low Degree of Knowledge was their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lot: For much Knowledge can only be acquired by much Leiſure; which their Occupations did not allow. The People of SPARTA were intentionally virtuous: Thoſe of ATHENS were corrupt: Thoſe of ROME were of a mixed Character. As theſe free States voted not by Repreſentatives, the Preſence of the People was neceſſary, in all Deciſions of a public Nature: Hence, ſuch a People from their Ignorance, Wants, collective Preſence, and Pride of Power, muſt ever and ſuddenly be

            <p>But the <hi>collective</hi> Body of the People of BRITAIN are of a Nature and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter leſs uniform, and eſſentially diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

            <p>AT this famed Period, it is evident, that the Manners and Principles of the Nation did, upon the Whole, tend to the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Liberty;</hi> otherwiſe, Liberty had not been eſtabliſhed. This Revolution was perhaps the nobleſt public <hi>Reform</hi> that ever was made in any State: And ſuch a Reform, nothing but the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0043801700:90"/>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>religious</hi> Principle of <hi>Proteſtant Chriſtianity</hi> ſeems to have taken the Lead, even of the Love of civil Freedom. The Dread of <hi>Popery</hi> was, at leaſt, equal to That of <hi>arbitrary Power:</hi> The national <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> (on the whole) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incided with, and confirmed the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Principle: Theſe three united Powers raiſed Liberty to the brighteſt Throne ſhe ever ſat on: A Throne which nothing but their <hi>Contraries</hi> can <hi>ſhake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding the unrivaled Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of this civil and religious Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, there could be little Hope of its immediate and perfect Efficacy. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers may expreſs their Wonder, that a Syſtem ſo perfect ſhould not at once attain its End: But they who take a nearer View of the Manners and Principles of thoſe Times, will rather ſay, that the Tumults and Diſſentions which inſtantly aroſe, were in their own Nature <hi>inevitable.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0043801700:91"/>
The Manners of the Times, tho' in the Main favourable to Liberty, were mixed with a groſs Alloy of <hi>private Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And hence, factious Meaſures of Courſe aroſe, from the Proſpect of Power or Gain. <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Eſtimate,</hi> V. i.

            <p>The <hi>religious</hi> Principle, though chiefly conſonant with the new Conſtitution, and indeed its leading Support, was in <hi>Part</hi> at <hi>Variance</hi> with it.—A numerous Body of <hi>Papiſts</hi> held a whole Syſtem of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples diametrically oppoſite to its moſt eſſential Dictates.—Another Body of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0043801700:92"/>
               <hi>Jacobites</hi> were at War with the Principles of the State: For they held an hereditary and unalienable Right of Kings, founded on certain <hi>miſtaken</hi> Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the ſacred Scriptures.—A third Body of Men, though they allowed the Neceſſity and Juſtice of the Revolution, on the Principle of an <hi>Abdication,</hi> yet ſtill retained an Opinion at Variance with the State: They aſſerted an <hi>independent Hierarchy,</hi> vindicated a religious <hi>Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and on ſome miſconſtrued Paſſages of Scripture, affirmed the Duty of a <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience</hi> without Limitation.—A fourth Body was That of ſome bigoted <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who not content with a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Toleration which had been juſtly granted them, aimed, on a miſtaken Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Religion, to erect their own Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem upon the Ruins of the eſtabliſhed Church.—All theſe Parties held <hi>religious Principles</hi> at <hi>Variance</hi> with the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Freedom.</hi>

The Principle of <hi>Honour,</hi> tho' in many, and great Inſtances, co-operating with that of Religion; yet when not founded on it, was often at <hi>Variance</hi> with it. This Principle, as it hath appeared in modern Times, was in its Origin chiefly <hi>Military.</hi> Hence it hath generally taken Cognizance of Actions, not as they are <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>unjuſt,</hi> but merely as they are <hi>ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi> or <hi>mean, brave</hi> or <hi>cowardly:</hi> Thus, it overlooks all Laws, both human and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: Hence unbounded Contempt of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, furious Party-Rage, unlimited Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and Revenge, <hi>were</hi> and ſtill <hi>are</hi> its favourite Dictates. Thus it hath come to paſs, that Honour often forbids what Religion approves; and approves what Religion forbids. This uncontrouled and dangerous Principle mixed itſelf with the licentious Manners of the Times: Hence, Attachments, Reſentments, and Party-Rage, aroſe and were perſiſted in, eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the Principles of Freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0043801700:94"/>
Conſonant with what hath been above delivered, the Principle of <hi>Conſcience</hi> did not <hi>correct,</hi> but <hi>followed</hi> one or other of theſe various Principles, according to their Predominance and Power. And <hi>Theſe</hi> being incurably diſcordant among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the national Ideas of Right and Wrong, Juſt and Unjuſt, which were formed on <hi>Theſe,</hi> could not but prove themſelves of the like <hi>motley</hi> and <hi>diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Complexion.</p>
            <p>Here, then, we behold the natural and unavoidable Source of all the Diſſentions that diſgraced the Reigns of King WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM and Queen ANNE. And while ſome affect to wonder, how ſo generous a Syſtem of Religion and Polity, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Conſtitution in Church and State, could fail to produce private Virtue and public Happineſs; we now obtain an additional Proof of the irreſiſtable Power of <hi>pre-eſtabliſhed Manners</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> when at <hi>Variance</hi> with the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> We may ſee, even to Demonſtration,

Would to God, theſe intentional Friends of public Liberty had been as much the Friends of private Virtue and Religion! They would not, then, have undermined the Foundations, while they were building the Superſtructure of civil Freedom.</p>
            <p>The Seeds of Irreligion had for ſome Time been privately fermenting: But they did not break forth into open Growth till about this Period.—'Tis remarkable, that BURNET, <note n="*" place="bottom">Concluſion of his Hiſtory.</note> enumerating the Dangers by which the State was threatened in the Year 1708, makes no Mention of <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as an Evil worth being obviated.

            <p>The ſlaviſh Principle of abſolute <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> and an <hi>independent Hierarchy,</hi> were ſtill prevalent in Part, eſpecially among the <hi>Clergy.</hi> To combat <hi>theſe,</hi> and expoſe them to the public Contempt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Writers were encouraged by Thoſe

in Power. A vigorous and effectual At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was made on the Advocates for Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm. But in their Zeal againſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, theſe Writers ſupplanted Freedom.</p>

            <p>CATO's <hi>Letters,</hi> and the <hi>Independent Whig,</hi> among many other Tracts of leſs Note, ſeem palpable Inſtances of this Truth: The one was written in Defence of <hi>civil,</hi> the other, of <hi>religious</hi> Liberty.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0043801700:100"/>
ruling Principle of the Times; when <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> began to be derided as Things <hi>indifferent.</hi> The noble Writer was naturally led to embrace this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Error of the Times, by a too flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Opinion which he had imbibed concerning unaſſiſted human Nature; as being ſufficient of itſelf to eſtabliſh the unerring Practice of Virtue, unleſs before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſophiſticated by ſervile Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The noble Writer, indeed, attempts a Vindication of this licentious Conduct, by an Appeal to the Practice of ancient GREECE and ROME. There, he tells us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">

            </p>
            <p>Soon after the Author of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics,</hi> another more diſſolute Writer appeared on the public Stage. I mean, the Author of <q rend="inline">"The Fable of the Bees."</q> This Gentleman, as hath been obſerved above, leveled his Artillery on the whole Fabric of <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> His Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem was diametrically oppoſite to that of Lord SHAFTESBURY: The one was founded on the <hi>unaided Excellence,</hi> the other on the <hi>incurable Depravity</hi> of <hi>human Nature.</hi> But now the vagrant Spirit of Irreligion

of Lord BOLINGBROKE: An Author who ſtands convicted of deſigned Profligacy, even on his own Confeſſion. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Some Men there are, <hi>the Peſts</hi> of <hi>Society I think them,</hi> who pretend a great Regard to Religion in general, but who take every Opportunity of declaiming pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly againſt that Syſtem of Religion, or at leaſt that Church Eſtabliſhment, which is received in BRITAIN. <note n="*" place="bottom">Diſſert. on Parties.

            </p>
            <p>The laſt of theſe patriot Worthies, by which the preſent Age ſtands diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the Author of <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Eſſays philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical and moral:"</q> Who, diſdaining the vulgar Practice of a particular Attack, <hi>undermines</hi> all the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, revealed</hi> and <hi>natural;</hi> and with a Pen truly <hi>Epicurean,</hi> diſſolves at once all

How This came to paſs, and aggravated the growing Evil, it is now neceſſary to point out.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen above, that a Foundation was laid for this, in an ill-conducted Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Enemies of Freedom. They who were employed to ſweep away <hi>falſe Principles,</hi> imprudently ſtruck at <hi>all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beyond This, a famous Miniſter aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and long held the Reins of Power. There ſeems not the leaſt Foundation for the Charge laid againſt him by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That his Deſign was to inſlave his Country."</q> Neither had he any
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0043801700:105"/>
natural Inclination to corrupt Practices: Yet he rather choſe to rule by Theſe, than to reſign his Power. Nay, perhaps he thought this corrupt Syſtem the only one, which, under the Circumſtances of Thoſe Times, could ſupport that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Family, which was brought in, as the happy Support of Liberty.

            <p>In the mean Time, <hi>Trade, Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> increaſed: Theſe, in their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,</hi> having an unalterable Tendency

to a Diſſolution of Manners and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, went Hand in Hand with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Corruption; which, in its moſt improved State, this miſtaken Miniſter left, as a laſting Legacy to his Country. <note n="*" place="bottom">See an Eſtimate, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>The Effects of this eſtabliſhed Syſtem of Corruption did not immediately appear: But about the Year fifty-ſeven, they came to their <hi>Criſis;</hi> advancing with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances even of <hi>public Ruin.</hi>

            <p>It follows alſo, that it muſt ariſe on Foundations widely different from Thoſe in the Reigns of WILLIAM and ANNE. For the Diſſentions of theſe <hi>paſt</hi> Times were chiefly founded in <hi>falſe Principles:</hi>

Thoſe of the <hi>preſent</hi> Age, on a <hi>Want of Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the falſe Principles which diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Proteſtants of the laſt Age, are vaniſhed. The miſtaken Interpretations of Scripture, on which the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> the <hi>Tory,</hi> the <hi>bigoted Diſſenter,</hi> founded their various Pretenſions and Attempts, are <hi>now</hi> held in general Deriſion: A Preacher, of whatever religious Congregation, who ſhould <hi>now</hi> advance theſe obſolete State-Heterodoxies, would be the Contempt of his wiſer Audience.</p>
            <p>Nay, what is more, theſe falſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tending to Deſpotiſm, are generally baniſhed, even from the Breaſts of the Clergy; except only a very few of the moſt aged.

            <p>THOUGH this Want of Principle muſt naturally infect every Rank of Men, in a certain Degree; yet ſome Ranks ſtand more expoſed to it than others.</p>
            <p>And, that we may give as little Offence as poſſible, while we ſpeak the Truth; let it be obſerved, that all Orders of Men being born with an equal Tendency to Virtue or Vice; their adopting the One, or falling into the Other, depends chiefly on the Temptations to which their <hi>Rank</hi> expoſes them.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider the Temptations to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs and Faction, to which the <hi>leading Ranks</hi> ſtand expoſed.</p>
            <p>Wealth and Power give Opportunities of Indulgence; Indulgence naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames Appetite.—Flattery awakens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and Contempt weakens the Fear
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0043801700:110"/>
of Offence or Shame.—Laws which bind little Men, are often too weak for Great ones.—Leiſure, when not dignify'd by ſuitable Accompliſhments, ends in Idleneſs; and Idleneſs is the Parent and the Nurſe of licentious Folly. To ſuch Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do the <hi>Great</hi> ſtand expoſed, in the important Article of <hi>Manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With Reſpect to the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> their preſent Situation is no leſs unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. Diſſolute Opinions flatter their diſordered Paſſions: Nor will they ever want Sycophants, to preſent this alluring Bait to their Deſires.—The Maxims of Irreligion are now ſo generally eſtabliſhed among Thoſe with whom the young Men of Faſhion converſe, that they muſt be peculiarly fortunate, if they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the <hi>Infection.</hi> Wherever This Taint is given, the Principles of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> become vague and ineffectual, if conſidered as the Supports of Liberty. Certain <hi>Delicacies</hi> of <hi>perſonal</hi> Conduct they may produce; but can never riſe to an

unbiaſſed and ſteady Proſecution of the <hi>public Welfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Circumſtance unfavourable to the <hi>public</hi> Virtue of the higher Ranks preſents itſelf. Their Situation leads them to <hi>expect,</hi> and to <hi>claim,</hi> the great and <hi>lucrative Offices</hi> of the State. I need not <hi>here</hi> point out, how ſtrongly This tends to betray them into the Extremes of ſelfiſh Views, Ambition, Party-Rage, Licentiouſneſs, and Faction. <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Eſtimate, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>Add to all theſe Conſiderations, their frequent and long-continued Meetings in the Capital: A Circumſtance which, from the powerful Effects of <hi>free Communication,</hi> cannot but inflame all theſe Cauſes of political Diſſention.</p>
            <p>If we next examine the State of the <hi>Populace</hi> of the great Cities, we ſhall find that Their Situation naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to ſuch Temptations as lead to factious Conduct, when not early for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd by a virtuous Education. They
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0043801700:112"/>
are often urged by <hi>Want;</hi> of which, <hi>Diſcontent</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> are the inevitable Effects. They are let looſe to every Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of Appetite, by frequent Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Secrecy of Action: They are tempted by wicked Examples; inflamed by evil Communication and intoxicating Liquors: And though the induſtrious Mechanic may ſometimes eſcape the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; yet the Life of the <hi>uninſtructed Poor</hi> in great Cities, is too commonly a horrid Compound of Riot and Diſtreſs, Rapacity and Thieving, Proſtitution and Robbery, Wickedneſs and Deſpair.</p>
            <p>Now if this Body of Men be indeed, what Candour itſelf cannot deny, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"too generally ignorant and ill-educated; too generally profligate in Manners, and void of Principle;"</q> it follows, that like  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the <hi>Athenian Populace</hi> of old, they muſt be liable to the <hi>Seduction</hi> of artful Men;</q> the ready <hi>Tools</hi> of every unprincipled <hi>Leader,</hi> who may chooſe to miſguide them, to the Ends of <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi>

            <p>Let not the Writer be miſunderſtood. There are Examples of Integrity and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, of Virtue and Vice, among all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Men. He only points out the Circumſtances which naturally tend, upon the Whole, to form the ſeveral Ranks into theſe diſtinct Characters.</p>
            <p>From this View of the ſeveral Ranks, it follows, that although <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The <hi>People</hi> of this Kingdom"</q> muſt inevitably partake of the various Manners and Principles of the <hi>Great</hi> and the <hi>Populace,</hi> with which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0043801700:115"/>
they at Times communicate; though they be ſubject to the common Failings of Men, and to the <hi>incidental</hi> Inroads of Licentiouſneſs from <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower</hi> Life;—yet upon the Whole, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as one <hi>collective Body,</hi> they ſtand comparatively clear of many Temptations to Vice; and therefore muſt naturally be leaſt expoſed to the Influence of <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Conſequence, ariſing from their <hi>Diſperſion,</hi> muſt not paſs unnoticed. It not only prevents the general Depravation of their Manners and Principles, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prevents their <hi>uniting</hi> in large <hi>Bodies,</hi> upon all <hi>ſlight</hi> Occaſions. Hence, though they are apt to <hi>doubt,</hi> nay to be <hi>alarmed,</hi> on the <hi>factious Clamours</hi> of the <hi>Capital;</hi> yet they are not rowzed into <hi>Action,</hi> but on <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>important</hi> Emergencies.</p>
            <p>To conclude: They are a <hi>great,</hi> but <hi>quieſcent</hi> Power; on whoſe <hi>collective Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> the Freedom and Fate of this Nation muſt <hi>finally</hi> depend. In

            <p>THUS the Writer hath endeavoured to lay open the Foundations and Characters of Licentiouſneſs and Faction: He now proceeds to conſider the moſt effectual Means of checking them in their Progreſs; of reſtoring internal Uhanimity; and ſecuring public Freedom.</p>
            <p>In every national Malady of this Nature, there are two Kinds of Remedies eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially diſtinct: The one is palliative, and temporary; the other is radical, and laſting.</p>
            <p>The palliative Remedies ought to be firſt apply'd; becauſe it will appear, that they are the only Means by which we can come at Thoſe which are radical.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident, then, that the firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards a Cure of this national

Evil muſt ariſe from the ſteady Conduct of the Prince. For Faction, unoppoſed, and led on by the higher Ranks, will never ceaſe in its Demands, till it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the Poſſeſſion of an unbounded ariſtocratic Power: This is a Power, which nothing but the Courage and Steadineſs of the Prince can poſſibly contend with: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the final Object of ſuch a Faction will always be, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Thoſe high and lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Offices of State, which are in <hi>His</hi> ſole <hi>Diſpoſal."</hi>

            <p>A plauſible Objection, then, is here to be obviated: For a late Writer hath very calmly and ſyſtematically attempted to prove the univerſal and unconditional Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of political Corruption, in all free Governments. <note n="*" place="bottom">See a free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil, Let. v.</note>

What follows is the Foundation of his Argument. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"All human Government is the Offspring of Violence and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and muſt inherit the Imperfection of both its Parents. <note n="*" place="bottom">Origin of Evil, p. 128.</note>"</q>

            </p>
            <p>Such is the Sum of this Gentleman's Argument: To which, the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are offered, as a Reply.</p>
            <p>There have been two different Pictures given of <hi>Man,</hi> by different Writers, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to each other. By ſome, the human Species hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0043801700:145"/>
as a natural Society of Angels; by others, as a Crew of Devils. Both theſe Repreſentations have ariſen from a partial View of Mandkind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his <hi>ſocial</hi> Qualities only; the other overlooking Theſe, and fixing on the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites which are commonly called the <hi>felfiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were Mankind of the firſt of theſe Characters, they would need no Law! Were they of the latter, no Law could unite or bind them. The Truth is, they are a Mixture of Both. As they have the ſeveral Modes of Self-Love, for the Preſervation of the Individual; ſo, by <hi>proper Culture,</hi> they gain Habits of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, Religion, ſocial Prudence, the Love of honeſt Reputation, and ſometimes even a Regard for the general Welfare of the Society to which they belong. As theſe ſocial Paſſions and Regards are ſtrong or weak, frequent or uncommon; the Character of a Nation is good or bad, honeſt or corrupt, upright or profligate.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0043801700:146"/>

            </p>
            <p>Here, then, this Maxim of the abſolute and unconditional Neceſſity of Political Corruption appears in all its Nakedneſs and Deformity: For it is founded on <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the ſuppoſed incurable Wickedneſs of Man:"</q> An Error too glaring to need a Confutation; and which there is ſtill the leſs Occaſion to confute, becauſe this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf admits the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0043801700:148"/>It follows then, that his leading Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as falſe in itſelf, as it is pernicious to Society, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Corruption muſt always increaſe in due Proportion to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of arbitrary Power:"</q> Becauſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion, upright Manners and Principles, properly inſtilled, may much better ſupply Corruption's Place. <note n="*" place="bottom">Were it neceſſary to purſue this Gentleman through all the Windings of his political Labyrinth, and trace him to the End of his Courſe, where he ſuddenly ſtarts up in the Form of a ſevere Moraliſt; there could not, perhaps, be exhibited a more ſtriking Inſtance of Self-Contradiction, in the whole Compaſs of literary Debate.—At preſent I ſhall only remark, that this Eſſay was publiſhed in the Year 1757, at a Time when the Syſtem of political Corruption much needed ſome Kind of Apology, becauſe its fatal Effects began to gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>LET us now conſider, what might be in the Power of the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> immediately to effect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis generally acknowledged, that Power naturally follows Property. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exorbitant Property in Individuals muſt always be unfavourable to civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; muſt always tend to produce Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and Faction; becauſe it throws
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0043801700:151"/>
exorbitant Power into the Hands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals: And the greater the <hi>Inequality</hi> between the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> the more the <hi>one</hi> will ever be under the <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſhould ſeem, then, to be the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Intereſt even of the moſt <hi>Wealthy,</hi> if they be the real Friends of Liberty,—'tis certainly the <hi>general</hi> Intereſt of a <hi>free Community;</hi> that ſome legal Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Property ſhould take Place. I ſpeak not of the Probability, but the Expediency of ſuch a Meaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It follows, that ſome <hi>Regulation</hi> in Reſpect to <hi>Boroughs</hi> would be of great Importance. For in Boroughs, contrary to all ſound Policy, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Power is lodged without annexed Property."</q>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequence is, that  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"this ill-placed Power will be ſeized by Thoſe who are poſſeſſed of exorbitant Property."</q> Thus Power ſettles on its natural Foundation: But a Foundation, in this Inſtance, moſt dangerous to Freedom; as it leads to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0043801700:152"/>
Eſtabliſhment of an Ariſtocracy. In This Inſtance, too, I ſpeak not of the Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but the Expediency of the Meaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Limitation of extended Conqueſt and Empire might ſeem an Object worthy the Attention of the higheſt Powers.—ROME periſhed by its Avidity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Empire. Colonies, when peopled beyond a certain Degree, become a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Mother Country: They exhauſt her Numbers; they diſtract her Attention; they divide her compacted Strength. Such Extent of Colonies, as may be neceſſary to maintain the Empire of the Seas, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be a juſt Object of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Regard. More than this, ſound Policy perhaps could hardly dictate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Limitation is of more Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as it would naturally ſet Bounds to another Exceſs: I mean, That of Trade and Wealth. This, the Writer knows, is of all other Topics the moſt unpopular: Notwithſtanding which, he preſumes to perſiſt in what appears to Him a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0043801700:153"/>
Truth, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"exorbitant Trade and Wealth are moſt dangerous to private Virtue and therefore to public Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom."</q> The Topic is too large, to be here inſiſted on. He therefore refers to what he hath already written on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; <note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſtimate, Part iii. paſſim.</note> which hath been much clamoured againſt, indeed; but never confuted. <note n="†" place="bottom">For the Conviction of Thoſe who chuſe rather to attend to <hi>preſent</hi> than <hi>future</hi> Conſequences, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumſtance may deſerve Notice. Much hath been ſaid <q rend="inline margQuotes">"on the Cauſe of the preſent exorbitant Price of Proviſions, and general Diſtreſs of the Poor:"</q>Every Cauſe hath been aſſigned except the true one, which ſeems to be  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the ſinking Value of Money, ariſing neceſſarily from the exorbitant Increaſe of Trade and Wealth."</q> If this be ſo, it follows, that the Evil is incurable, excepting only by a general Augmentation of the Wages of the Poor.—Now This, which is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Effect of the Exorbitancy of Commerce, naturally tends (by the increaſed Price of Manufactures) to the Deſtruction of Commerce. If the Exorbitancy of Trade ſhould ſtill run higher, this Evil will be aggravated in Proportion. The Conſequences which muſt follow, are ſuch as the Writer chuſeth not to enlarge on; becauſe he knows, the Spirit of the Times would not bear it.</note>

5. The immediate Care of upright Manners and Principles might ſeem an Object worthy the ſtricteſt Attention both of the Legiſlature and Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>To this End, if the growing Spirit of <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Adoption</hi> could by any Means be checked, it would be a Work attended with the moſt ſalutary Conſequences. The Writer would not willingly be thought chimerically to adopt all the Rigours of the <hi>Spartan</hi> State: But could wiſh to ſee a Law enacted, parallel to That of LACEDAEMON, by which their raw and unexperienced Youth were prohibited from bringing Home the new Follies and Vices of foreign Countries, picked up in a premature and too early Travel. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſtimate, Vol. ii. Part i. Sect. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He would by no Means diſcourage the <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>Preſs:</hi> Yet, ſure, its <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs</hi> might ſeem an Object of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate's Regard. The Search of Truth is good: But to ſearch for This in the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0043801700:155"/>
Hoards of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> is like ſearching for <hi>Hope</hi> in PANDORA'S <hi>Box;</hi> where the ſole Reward of Induſtry can only be <hi>Peſtilence, Deſpair</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> National Virtue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was maintained, but by national Religion: He, therefore, who ſhakes the eſſential Principles of Religion, undermines the Virtue of his Fellow-Subjects; and therefore deſerves to feel the Rigour of the Law, as a determined <hi>Enemy</hi> of his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—</hi>This may ſeem a practicable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: But how to deſtroy thoſe irreligious Writings, which already lie expoſed on Stalls and Counters, or depoſited in private Libraries, like ſo many Heaps of Poiſon, for the Gratification of Vice, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Virtue:—Or how to pluck from the Minds of Men thoſe poiſoned Arrows, which theſe Authors have already planted there!—That were a <hi>Taſk indeed!—</hi>The Shaft is already flown; and cannot be recalled: And this Nation, thro' ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Times will have Cauſe to ſay,<q rend="inline">—"Haeret Lateri lethalis Arundo."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0043801700:156"/>
               <hi>Immoral Writings</hi> ſhould ſeem no leſs the Object of the Magiſtrate's Attention. Tho' Theſe may not ſhake the <hi>Principles,</hi> yet they inevitably corrupt the <hi>Manners</hi> of a Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perſonal Defamation,</hi> or Calumny thrown on <hi>private</hi> Characters, is another Evil, which ſeems riſing at preſent with unheard-of Aggravations. Two <hi>ſlagrant</hi> Inſtances of This Enormity the Writer will paſs unnoticed, leſt he ſhould ſeem to inſult over the <hi>Exiled</hi> or the <hi>Dead.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In theſe two Kinds of modern Profligacy, <hi>immoral Writings,</hi> and <hi>perſonal Calumny,</hi> there is one profeſſed Author, now ſaid to be living in this Kingdom with Impunity; who, in a better policed State would ere this have felt the full Weight of that public Puniſhment and Infamy which is due to an Enemy of Mankind.

            <head>SECT. XXVI. Of the chief and eſſential Remedy.</head>
            <p>ALL theſe may be regarded as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and concomitant Supports of Freedom. But the chief and eſſential Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to Licentiouſneſs and Faction, the fundamental Means of the laſting and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Eſtabliſhment of civil Liberty, can only <q rend="inline margQuotes">"lie in a general and preſcribed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Laws of Education."</q>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſeen above, that upright Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Principles are the only Baſis of true Liberty; that the infant Mind, if left to its own untutored Dictates, inevitably wanders into ſuch Follies and Vices, as tend to the Deſtruction of itſelf and others. We have ſeen, that the early and continued Culture of the Heart can alone produce ſuch upright Manners and Principles, as are neceſſary to check and ſubdue the ſelfiſh Paſſions of the Soul; and that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0043801700:158"/>
can only ariſe from a general Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Theſe, to the public Welfare. We have ſeen theſe Truths confirmed, by an Appeal to the State of three famed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, which by Turns <hi>aroſe</hi> and <hi>fell,</hi> on the very Principles here delivered. We have ſeen the Defects, as well as Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, of our own public Conſtitution, both <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious:</hi> That its Form is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and unrivaled; but that the practical <hi>Application</hi> of this unrivaled Excellence is attended with Defects incurable: That it hath all along been inevitably counterwork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Manners and Principles diſcordant with its Genius, and diſcordant with each other: That for Want of a preſcribed Code of Education, to which all the Members of the Community ſhould legally ſubmit, the Manners and Principles on which alone the State can reſt, are ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inſtilled, are vague, fluctuating, and ſelf-contradictory.</p>
            <p>Nothing, then, is more evident, than that ſome Reform in this great Point, is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0043801700:159"/>
neceſſary, for the Security of public Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Till this be effected, in Spite of all temporary Remedies, Licentiouſneſs and Faction, tho' checked for a Time, will ever be gathering new Strength, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Charge with redoubled Fury.</p>
            <p>This Reform, to ſome, may appear eaſy to effect: By others it will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, as wholly impracticable. Perhaps the Truth may lie between theſe two Opinions: To throw the Manners and Principles of a Nation into any new Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, is certainly a Work of no ſmall Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.—On the other Hand, we ſeem to have many Materials lying round us, ready to be converted into the Means of this great Work. A pure and rational Religion; a generous Syſtem of Policy, founded on that Religion; Manners, tho' apparently degenerating, yet by no Means generally profligate; much true Religion, Integrity, and Honour among the <hi>middle</hi> Ranks; many Inſtances of <hi>domeſtic Worth</hi> among the <hi>higher;</hi> and in Spite of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0043801700:160"/>
Temptations that ſurround the <hi>Great,</hi> true <hi>Piety,</hi> and the <hi>moral Virtues</hi> adorning the <hi>moſt exalted Station.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, without dreaming of the perfect Republic of PLATO;—and fairly acknowledging the incurable Defect of our political State, in not having a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent and adequate Code of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inwrought into its firſt Eſſence;—we may yet hope, that in a ſecondary and inferior Degree, ſomething of this Kind may be ſtill <hi>inlaid:</hi> It cannot have that perfect Efficacy, as if it had been originally <hi>of the Piece:</hi> Yet, if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, it may ſtrengthen the weak Parts; and <hi>alleviate</hi> Defects, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly <hi>remove</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Among <hi>what Ranks,</hi> in the Writer's Opinion, theſe <hi>Defects</hi> in <hi>Education</hi> chiefly <hi>lie,</hi> may be ſufficiently collected from ſome of the preceding Sections. But as to the moſt <hi>effectual Methods</hi> of <hi>relieving</hi> theſe <hi>Defects,</hi> he pretends not at preſent to attempt ſo great a Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0043801700:161"/>
This, however, he is well perſwaded of; that till ſomething of the Kind be attempted and performed; all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured Harangues that can be given from the <hi>Bench,</hi> the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> or the <hi>Preſs,</hi> will be of little Avail: They may tend <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally</hi> to <hi>obviate</hi> ſome of the <hi>Evils</hi> of <hi>Licentiouſneſs;</hi> but never can <hi>radically cure them.</hi>

            <p>THESE Remedies, however <hi>juſt</hi> in their <hi>Nature,</hi> can only be <hi>effectual</hi> through a proper Application: And this can only lie <q rend="inline margQuotes">"in a zealous and unfeigned Union of the <hi>Honeſt</hi> among all <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> for the <hi>Accompliſhment</hi> of <hi>theſe Ends,</hi> againſt the Patrons and Inſtruments of Licentiouſneſs and Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0043801700:162"/>
This Union, at firſt View, ſeems of ſuch a Nature as could hardly need to be inforced: Yet it is frequently retarded by ſeveral Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Great,</hi> this rational Union is often counteracted by the Ties of falſe Honour; a dangerous Principle, which we have already noted, as being produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Party-Rage and Faction. <note n="*" place="bottom">See above, p. 92.</note> This Principle, even in honeſt Minds, will ſometimes prevail over the Dictates of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and private Virtue. On this falſe Foundation, political Connexions are often maintained, in Defiance of a juſt Senſe of public Utility: While the unhappy Man who acts on this miſtaken Motive, is inwardly rent by two contrary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Powers. Severe Moraliſts may perhaps diſcard ſuch a Character from the Liſt of the <hi>Honeſt:</hi> But it ſhould ſeem, that he is rather an Object of Clemency than Indignation. Remove but the unhappy Prejudice from his Breaſt;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0043801700:163"/>
And ſuch a Character would preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward among the firſt, towards the <hi>Goal</hi> of <hi>public Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again: This rational and ſalutary Union may be retarded by Connexions of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Gratitude,</hi> or <hi>Blood.</hi> This Cauſe tends to confirm and extend the Influence of the former. <hi>Fathers, powerful Friends,</hi> and <hi>Patrons,</hi> connect themſelves with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and cleave to them on a miſtaken Principle: <hi>Sons, obliged Friends,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> are naturally inliſted in their Party; and are rivetted in it, not only by <hi>falſe Honour,</hi> but <hi>Education, Gratitude, Affection.</hi> How peculiarly unfortunate is this Circumſtance; that the <hi>generous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> ſhould ever become the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of <hi>public Virtue!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame falſe Attachment to Friends, Patrons, and Relations, naturally prevails, in a certain Proportion, among the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Ranks of the Kingdom. Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, Paſſions, and Prejudices, are not ſo immediately concerned as Thoſe of the higher Ranks; and therefore 'tis natural
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0043801700:164"/>
to ſuppoſe, that their mutual Attachments of miſtaken Honour or private Affection, will upon the Whole be more moderate and leſs culpable. Yet ſtill, while theſe falſe Attachments are prevalent among the <hi>Great,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> muſt in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree catch the Infection, from the various Relations which they bear to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. Hence untractable Prejudices ariſe, and are maintained: While <hi>Meaſures</hi> are leſs regarded, than the <hi>Party</hi> which <hi>adopts</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But beſides This, another Circumſtance ariſeth, which inevitably tends to <hi>diſunite,</hi> and <hi>diſtract</hi> the <hi>Honeſt</hi> among the <hi>People;</hi> even when their perſonal Attachments are conquered by their Integrity. Their <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion</hi> in the Country hath already been remarked, as a Circumſtance worthy of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Here it meets us again, as a Cauſe of their frequent <hi>Diſunion.</hi> We have ſeen how naturally (under the preſent State of Things) every factious Clamour that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the Capital, is tranſmitted with aggravated Circumſtances, through the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0043801700:165"/>
whole Kingdom. <note n="*" place="bottom">See above, Sect. xix, p. 130.</note> And the People of the Villages being eaſy of Belief, becauſe not ſuſpecting the abandoned Profligacy of theſe <hi>Town-Defamers,</hi> are apt to receive every inſinuated <hi>perſonal Slander,</hi> as a <hi>Truth.</hi> Theſe Calumnies being ſeldom contradicted by the injured Party, take Root in the Minds of the leſs knowing. Hence Doubts ariſe; Surmiſes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes are ſpread; Facts, though void of all Foundation, are alledged and perſiſted in; the more credulous Part are miſled: Thus an honeſt People are divided; and not only a <hi>Province</hi> or a <hi>Village,</hi> but even an <hi>Houſe</hi> often ſet at Variance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in itſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe Contentions <hi>ſometimes</hi> ariſe to a Degree which is ridiculous: And have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſo deſcribed <hi>without Exception,</hi> by the Tools of Faction. Notwithſtanding This, every Friend of Liberty ought to grieve, if a <hi>free,</hi> an <hi>honeſt,</hi> and a <hi>ſenſible</hi> PEOPLE ſhould ever deſiſt (were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0043801700:166"/>
to debate on Affairs of Government. Tho' they may be occaſionally alarmed and miſled on ſlight Occaſions, yet their mature and collective Judgment on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Subjects, will <hi>ſeldom</hi> be <hi>erroneous.</hi> On this Foundation, MONTESQUIEU'S Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is ſolid: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Tell me not, that ſuch a People will ſometimes <hi>reaſon ill:"</hi>
               </q> 'Tis ſufficient, <q rend="inline">"that <hi>they reaſon.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">L'Eſprit des Loix.</note>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Guilt and ill Conſequences, then, ariſe from the malevolent Clamours of the Capital, tranſmitted thence to the Provinces. Theſe Clamours, though not of Power to ſeduce an <hi>honeſt</hi> PEOPLE into actual Sedition, are yet often ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to <hi>alarm</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> them. <note n="†" place="bottom">See above, Sect. xiii. p. 114.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Much Caution, therefore, ought to be uſed by the Inhabitants of the <hi>Country,</hi> how they give Credit to the <hi>political</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the <hi>Town;</hi> which are ſeldom ſpread without Deſign; and are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſpread moſt induſtriouſly by the Malevolent. They who act on good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0043801700:167"/>
are apt to truſt to the native Force of Truth: The Patrons of Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are conſcious of a Defect <hi>here;</hi> and therefore endeavour to ſupply it by a miſapply'd Diligence and Cunning.</p>
            <p>One Mark of Licentiouſneſs and Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is peculiarly applicable to theſe Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from the Metropolis: If they are fraught with <hi>perſonal Calumny,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack private Characters, they aſſuredly come from the <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Theſe, therefore, a <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> PEOPLE will learn to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride.</hi> This Foundation once laid, they will not be far from a <hi>general Union</hi> againſt the <hi>hidden Deſigns</hi> of <hi>Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Concluſion, therefore, let the <hi>Honeſt</hi> among every <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Party</hi> recollect; that their firſt and higheſt Obligations are to God, their King, and Country. That every <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Connexion ought to <hi>yield</hi> to <hi>Theſe:</hi> That true <hi>Honour</hi> can never be at <hi>Variance</hi> with the Laws of <hi>Religion</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0043801700:168"/>
               <hi>Virtue:</hi> That if any <hi>Deſertion</hi> be <hi>ſhameful,</hi> it is the <hi>Deſertion</hi> from <hi>Truth</hi> and the Welfare of their <hi>Country:</hi> If any <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment</hi> be <hi>honourable,</hi> it is an impartial <hi>Attachment</hi> to the <hi>public Weal,</hi> unbiaſſed by private Affections and Regards.
