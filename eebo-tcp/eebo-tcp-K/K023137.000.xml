            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True
ACCOUNT
Of a Horrid and Barbarous
REVENGE by POISON, On the Body of Mr. <hi>Edm. Curll,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HISTORY furniſhes us with Examples of many Satyrical
Authors who have fallen Sacrifices to Revenge, but not
of any Bookſellers that I know of, except the unfortunate
Subject of the following Papers; I mean Mr. <hi>Edmund
Curll,</hi> at the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Dial</hi> in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> who was Yeſterday
poiſon'd by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> after having liv'd many Years an Inſtance of the
mild Temper of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>Every Body knows that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Edmund Curll,</hi> on Monday the
26th Inſtant, publiſh'd a Satyrical Piece, entituled <hi>Court Poems,</hi> in the
Preface whereof they were attributed to a <hi>Lady of Quality,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi>
or Mr. <hi>Gay</hi>; by which indiſcreet Method, though he had eſcaped one
Revenge, there were ſtill two behind in reſerve.</p>
            <p>Now on the Wedneſday enſuing, between the Hours of 10 and 11,
Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> a neighb'ring Bookſeller, deſir'd a Conference with Mr.
<hi>Curll</hi> about ſettling the <hi>Title Page</hi> of <hi>Wiquefort</hi>'s <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> inviting him
at the ſame Time to take a Whet together. Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> (who is not
the only Inſtance how Perſons of bright Parts may be carry'd away
by the Inſtigations of the Devil) found Means to convey himſelf into
the ſame Room, under pretence of Buſineſs with Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> who it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0859100300:3"/>
ſeems is the Printer of his <hi>Homer.</hi> This Gentleman with a ſeeming
Coolneſs, reprimanded Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> for wrongfully aſcribing to him the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Poems: He excuſed himſelf, by declaring that one of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
(Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> by Name) gave the Copies to the Preſs, and
wrote the <hi>Preface.</hi> Upon this Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> (being to all appearance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd)
very civilly drank a Glaſs of Sack to Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> which he as
civilly pledged; and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Taſte differ'd not
from common Sack, yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer
felt ſoon after, that ſome poiſonous Drug had been ſecretly infuſed
therein.</p>
            <p>About Eleven a Clock he went home, where his Wife obſerving his
Colour chang'd, ſaid, <hi>Are you not Sick, my Dear?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>Bloody
Sick</hi>; and incontinently fell a vomiting and ſtraining in an uncommon
and unnatural Manner, the Contents of his vomiting being as Green as
Graſs. His Wife had been juſt reading a Book of her Husband's print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
concerning <hi>Jane Wenham,</hi> the famous Witch of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and her
Mind miſgave her that he was bewitch'd; but he ſoon let her know
that he ſuſpected <hi>Poiſon,</hi> and recounted to her, between the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of his Yawnings and Reachings, every Circumſtance of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
with Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> in the mean Time coming in, was extremely afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the ſudden Alteration he obſerved in him: <hi>Brother</hi> Curll, ſays he,
<hi>I fear you have got the vomiting Diſtemper, which (I have heard) kills
in half an Hour. This comes from your not following my Advice, to
drink old Hock as I do, and abſtain from Sack.</hi> Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> reply'd, in
a moving Tone, <hi>Your Author's Sack I fear has done my Buſineſs.
Z<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ds,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Lintott, My Author!—Why did not you drink
old Hock?</hi> Notwithſtanding which rough Remonſtrance, he did in the
moſt friendly Manner preſs him to take warm Water; but Mr.
<hi>Curll</hi> did with great Obſtinacy refuſe it; which made Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>
infer, that he choſe to die, as thinking to recover greater Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</p>
            <p>All this Time the Symptoms encreas'd violently, with acute Pains
in the lower Belly. <hi>Brother</hi> Lintott, ſays he, <hi>I perceive my laſt Hour
approaching, do me the friendly Office to call my Partner, Mr.</hi> Pember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<hi>that we may ſettle our Worldly Affairs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> like a kind
Neighbour, was haſtening out of the Room, while Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> rav'd
aloud in this Manner, <hi>If I ſurvive this, I will be revenged on</hi> Tonſon<hi>,
it was he firſt detected me as the Printer of theſe Poems, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
theſe very Poems in his Name.</hi> His Wife admoniſh'd him not to
think of Revenge, but to take care of his Stock and his Soul: And
in the ſame Inſtant, Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> (whoſe Goodneſs can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
applauded) return'd with Mr. <hi>Pemberton.</hi> After ſome Tears
jointly ſhed by theſe Humane Bookſellers, Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> being (as he
ſaid) in his perfect Senſes though in great bodily Pain, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
proceeded to make a verbal Will (Mrs. <hi>Curll</hi> having firſt
put on his Night Cap) in the following Manner.</p>

               <p>GENTLEMEN, in the firſt Place, I do ſincerely pray Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for thoſe indirect Methods I have purſued in inventing
new Titles to old Books, putting Authors Names to Things they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>I call my Conſcience to Witneſs, that many of theſe Things which may

another Bookſeller? Your</hi> Proteſtant Packet <hi>might have ſupported you, had
you writ a little leſs ſcurrilouſly, There is a mean in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then turning to Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> he told him, he had ſeveral <hi>Taking
Title Pages</hi> that only wanted Treatiſes to be wrote to them, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entreated, that when they were writ, his Heirs might have ſome
Share of the Profit of them.</p>
            <p>After he had ſaid this he fell into horrible Gripings, upon which Mr.
<hi>Lintott</hi> advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer. He deſir'd his Wife to
ſtep into the Shop for a Common-Prayer-Book, and read it by the Help
of a Candle, without Heſitation. He clos'd the Book, fetch'd a Groan,
and recommended to Mrs. <hi>Curll</hi> to give Forty Shillings to the Poor of
the Pariſh of St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s, and a Week's Wages Advance to each of his

Gentlemen Authors, with ſome ſmall Gratuity in particular to Mrs.
<hi>Centlivre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poor Man continued for ſome Hours with all his diſconſolate
Family about him in Tears, expecting his final Diſſolution; when of
a ſudden he was ſurprizingly relieved by a plentiful foetid Stool, which
obliged them all to retire out of the Room. Notwithſtanding, it is
judged by Sir <hi>Richard Bl<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Body, and will infallibly deſtroy him by ſlow Degrees, in leſs than a
Month. It is to be hoped the other Enemies of this wretched Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
will not further purſue their Revenge, or ſhorten this ſmall Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
of his miſerable Life.</p>
