            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>NOW THE SPIRIT SPEAKETH EXPRESSLY, THAT IN THE LATTER TIMES SOME SHALL DEPART FROM THE FAITH.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>OF the many artifices which infidels have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in their attacks on the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, neither the leaſt common nor the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt is their availing themſelves, for disfigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its beauty and undermining its truth, of all the corruptions which the weakneſs or the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of men have aukwardly intermixed with it or ſuperadded to it. Againſt the religion of the New Teſtament, they have repeatedly urged objections for which it gives not even a pretence, and which can affect only human ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0224400400:4"/>
totally abhorrent from its real nature and prevailing genius.</p>
            <p>It is with a more ſpecious appearance both of fairneſs and of penetration, that they have attempted to infer its falſehood from the very exiſtence of theſe corruptions; arguing, that, if God really gave the goſpel as his beſt gift to mankind, his providence would have certainly preſerved its purity, and prevented its being vitiated, ſo as to become unfit for anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its important end, or even in ſome reſpects ſubverſive of it.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD of enlarging on the ſeveral topics from which it might be evinced that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is wholly inconcluſive, let us remark, what is more extraordinary, That the very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions from which it is deduced, afford evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of Chriſtianity. Unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the defence of this religion as, in one light, they ſeem to be, yet, viewed in other lights, they are a real proof of its divinity.</p>
            <p>That corruption which has taken place, was foreſeen and ſoretold by the firſt publiſhers of the Goſpel; and is therefore an irrefragable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of their divine inſpiration. It was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0224400400:5"/>
in the very beginning of Chriſtianity, while, as as far as human eye could ſee, it yet remained untainted, that the Apoſtle of the Gentiles ſaid, in my text, <q>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith.</q> In the context, and the other paſſages which relate to this ſubject <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 1, &amp;c. 2 Theſſ. ii. 3,—12.</note>, he deſcribes, as has been often inconteſtibly prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even in its moſt ſingular, unprecedented, and characteriſtical features, that grand apoſtaſy in the church, which did <hi>already work,</hi> though ſo covertly as to be decernible only by a divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuminated eye; but which early diſplayed itſelf in the ſubtilizing and impoſing ſpirit of Chriſtians, and was completed in the abſurd theology, the ſuperſtitious and idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the impure morality, the domination, the inſolence, and the cruelty of the papal church. He deſcribes it with ſuch accuracy and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as could proceed only from the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Omniſcient, and therefore demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that HE is the Author of that religion which the Apoſtles taught, as revealed by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0224400400:6"/>
IT is, I think, equally true, though not ſo obvious, that the <q>departure of ſome from the faith,</q> the corruption of Chriſtianity which has prevailed, conſidered in itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to its having been predicted, far from indicating the falſity of this religion, is a ſtrong preſumption of its being a true religion. For it will appear, on examination, to be one mark of diſtinction between true and falſe religions, That always the former are corrupted, and the latter improved, by lenth of time. Both the parts of this propoſition are ſuſceptible of the fulleſt evidence: And, in purſuing the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall ſtate the evidence of both, and then deduce the concluſions which they war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p n="1">I. FIRST, I ſhall ſhew, that univerſally and invariably true religions have, in courſe of time, degenerated and been corrupted. They are only three, the primeval religion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the Jewiſh, and the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I BEGIN with the primeval religion of mankind. But what was this? The generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of infidels will eagerly anſwer, Pure natural
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0224400400:7"/>
religion. If it was, they will certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that this was a true religion: and that it was early and univerſally corrupted in a miſerable manner, they cannot deny.</p>
            <p>One of them, however, far ſuperior in pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration to the reſt, is ſingular in aſſerting, that <q>polytheiſm or idolatry was, and neceſſarily muſt have been, the firſt and moſt ancient religion of mankind <note n="*" place="bottom">Hume, Diſſert. i. § 1.</note>;</q> and he endeavours to ſupport the aſſertion both by reaſonings, and from hiſtory.—On ſuppoſition, that the firſt men were left to ſearch out their religion by the powers of unaſſiſted Nature, his <hi>reaſonings</hi> would perhaps be ſolid: and, by producing them, he has exploded the favourite poſitions of his more reſerved brethren, concerning the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of reaſon, the plainneſs and perfection of the law of Nature, and the inutility of revelation. Indeed, concluſively as the whole of natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be <hi>proved</hi> by reaſon, yet natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>diſcovered</hi> by reaſon, was never in fact the religion of any age or nation.—In proving his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion from <hi>hiſtory,</hi> he has carefully omitted the expreſs teſtimony of the hiſtory unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the moſt ancient in the world. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0224400400:8"/>
fair, it was doubtleſs prudent. For, in contradiction to the far later hiſtories which alone he chooſes to quote, the Bible clearly teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies, that the firſt and moſt ancient religion of mankind was, not polytheiſm or idolatry, but the worſhip of the one true God.—At the ſame time, it invalidates all the <hi>reaſonings</hi> by which he would prove that it muſt have been otherwiſe: for it ſuppoſes not that circumſtance, on the reality of which their whole force de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; but eſtabliſhes quite the reverſe. It ſuppoſes not, that the firſt rude and ignorant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men diſcovered this pure religion by the force of reaſon; and therefore is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by any of the improbabilities of this hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happened, which he ſo anxiouſly enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. On the contrary, it accounts for this: It affirms that they were not left to themſelves; that they were taught by God; that, from the very beginning, he inſtructed them by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that revelation was not only the mode of conveying to them all their religious principles, but the ſole ſoundation of ſome of them.</p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary for our preſent purpoſe, to deſcribe the religion of the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0224400400:9"/>
From the lights held out by Moſes, we may, I think, collect, that the primeval religion of the lapſed world included the great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of natural religion, as far as the rudeneſs of the earlieſt men qualified them for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending them, One perfect God, the Creator and Governor of the world, the object of their worſhip and obedience; together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sabbath, in memory of the creation <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. ii. 2, 3.</note>; an intimation of the redemption of the world <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. iii. 15.</note>; and the rite of ſacrifice <note n="‡" place="bottom">Chap. iv. 3, 4.</note>, both as a mode of worſhip, and as typical of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed method of redemption. And, ſo far as we know, this continued to be the form of the true religion throughout the patriarchal age, with the addition only of informations concerning the line from which the Redeemer was to ſpring, the new promiſe of the land of Canaan to Abraham and his ſeed, and the rite of circumciſion as the ſign of God's covenant with them. But it is not neceſſary, on account of theſe ſew acceſſions, to conſider the Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamic as a new religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0224400400:10"/>
THIS religion, of divine original, was in all its parts very early corrupted. Not to inquire into the antediluvian defections from it, we are certain, that before the calling of Abraham it had been very generally relinquiſhed; the one true God forſaken; falſe gods introduced; the memory of the creation loſt; the memorial of it, the Sabbath, neglected; the promiſes of redemption forgotten; and ſacrifice, the type of it, abuſed. This corruption formed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, of which every ſucceeding ſpecies was worſe than the preceding, and every ſpecies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came worſe in time than it had been at firſt.</p>
            <p>FROM all the accounts which we have either of ancient nations or of rude nations latterly diſcovered, it ſeems evident, that the worſhip of the heavenly bodies is the ſpecies of idolatry into which mankind every where firſt declined. The ſun is the moſt glorious of all ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the fountain of light and heat, the ſource of fertility, the cauſe of the revolutions of the ſeaſons. His ſplendour and his uſefulneſs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attracted the attention of men. While they kept in mind the principles of true religion, they regarded him only as the ſenſible repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0224400400:11"/>
of the one God. But, forgetting them by degrees, loſing all memory of the creation, and ſinking deeper into ſenſe, they began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him for his own ſake, and reſted in <q>the work,</q> without <q>acknowledging the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter <note n="*" place="bottom">Wiſd. xiii. 1.</note>.</q> We know from hiſtory, that ſome nations held the ſun to be the only lord of heaven; and it is probable that he was the firſt object of idolatry in every nation. But he continued not long to be the only object of it. Other parts of Nature came to be "deemed" likewiſe "gods which govern the world <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 2.</note>:" the leſs ſplendid luminaries, the moon and the ſtars; the earth; the elements, fire, wind, and thunder; whatever either promoted or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed men's enjoyment of the productions of Nature; became gradually the objects of their adoration. Thus, degenerating continually, they multiplied their gods, till at length they numbered among them almoſt every thing uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and every thing hurtful.—In the beginning of this idolatry, their ritual was ſimple, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive only of their reverence <note n="‡" place="bottom">Job, xxxi. 27.</note>. It was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily increaſed with the number of their gods;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0224400400:12"/>
they came to be worſhiped by artificial ſymbol<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or by fire; and into the ritual of every god, many ſilly ceremonies were introduced: from trivial they grew abſurd; they degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cruelty; they terminated in human ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond ſpecies of idolatry, the worſhip of dead men deified, was early introduced by the paſſions of men. Eſteem of a revered pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſwelled into adoration: affection led to <q>honour as a god the child ſoon taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <note n="*" place="bottom">Wiſd. xiv. 15.</note>.</q> The eſtabliſhment of civil ſociety and the ſucceſſive inventions of arts gave it a rapid progreſs: veneration, gratitude, admiration, raiſed the founders of ſtates, the authors of uſeful diſcoveries, public benefactors, illuſtrious kings, rulers, and warriors, after their death, into divinities.—This ſpecies of idolatry was in every reſpect worſe than the former. It did not all at once baniſh that, but was ſuperadded to, or incorporated with it: to beſtow plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility on the worſhip of their conſecrated hero, they gave him the name, and inveſted him with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0224400400:13"/>
the government, of ſome of the celeſtial bodies; Oſiris by the Egyptians, and Belus by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians, was called the ſun; by degrees, the planets, the earth, the ſea, the air, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, rivers, almoſt every part of Nature, had ſome deity attached to it. Their falſe gods were therefore multiplied: and, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſometimes as a part of Nature, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as its preſiding god, confuſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtence were introduced into the character and attributes of each.—The moſt ſtupenduous parts of Nature, though unworthy of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are deſerving of our higheſt admiration; were they animated, they muſt be deemed far more glorious than human creatures: but, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable is the abſurdity of ſuppoſing dead men to be immortal gods.—The former were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal deities: the latter only local, contracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limited in their attachments and their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—The introduction of them accumulated ſuperſtitious rites of worſhip: it required nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and complex ceremonies, expreſſive of the character, the exploits, or the benefits of each hero god.</p>
            <p>This form of polytheiſm, bad at firſt, ſtill grew worſe.—The number of their gods was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0224400400:14"/>
continually increaſed, till, in every nation, it became enormous. The firſt gods had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably poſſeſſed conſiderable merit in their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtate; and, in their immortal, were conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed watchful, for promoting virtue, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provinces: but afterwards, multitudes were deified without a pretence to any merit; and many whoſe vices rendered them infamous and execrable. Heaven was crowded with aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned wretches unfit to be tolerated on earth. Additions were made to the hiſtory of each god, till their mythology became a huge maſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies and indecencies. The characters and deeds of their divinities would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced humanity, and held forth examples and patrons for every crime. With thoſe whom they ſuppoſed removed into the heavens, they at length proceeded to aſſociate ſome of the moſt worthleſs of the living; raiſing altars and paying divine honours, with the moſt abject a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation, to thoſe at whoſe cruelty they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and whoſe profligacy they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold without abhorrence.—For ſome time their devotion was directed ſolely to their inviſible gods; Homer gives no hint of the uſe of images, and for ſome ages the Romans had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0224400400:15"/>
none: their worſhip conſiſted wholly in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hymns, and ſacrifices. But growing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition ſoon demanded ſtatues of the gods, and plunged its infatuated votaries into the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful folly of adoring the works of their own hands, <q>falling down to the ſtock of a tree <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xliv. 19.</note>, ſpeaking to that which hath no life, calling for health upon that which is weak, praying for life to that which is dead, and for a good journey aſking that which cannot ſet a foot forward <note n="†" place="bottom">Wiſd. xiii. 17, 18.</note>.</q> Their religious rites were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and complicated: ſuitably to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their gods, they were ſometimes meanly flattering, ſometimes outrageouſly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and ſuitably to their different characters, many of them became madly riotous, abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably impure, or inhumanly barbarous.</p>
            <p>THE laſt degeneracy of the primeval reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, was the worſhip of brutes and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate things, which prevailed chiefly among the Egyptians and their colonies. That it was the moſt deteſtible form of Paganiſm, it is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſpend time in evincing: And it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0224400400:16"/>
from evil to worſe.—It ſeems to have ariſen from the hiſtory of their hero-gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded in hieroglyphics; in which the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of brutes and vegetables were employed as the marks or ſymbols of their ſeveral attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and exploits. Fond of their hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phics, they ſubſtituted theſe ſymbols of their divinities, in place of the images of them in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhape, which had been uſed formerly. The ſymbolical repreſentations were engraved in their temples; and by being conſtantly in their view while they worſhipped their god, they became cloſely aſſociated with him in their imaginations, and ſhared in their worſhip: they engaged the readier and the greater vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by being conſidered as inſtituted by the god himſelf.—Accuſtomed in this manner to venerate the figure of a plant or animal, they came by a very eaſy ſtep to hold the real one ſacred, as at leaſt a ſymbol of the god: And next, forgetting that it was but a ſymbol, they adored it as itſelf divine.—Each ſymbol had different ſignifications; and each attribute was repreſented by different ſymbols: in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe two circumſtances together, their animal and vegetable deities were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0224400400:17"/>
till they comprehended whatever had any quality remarkable enough to fit it for being an hieroglyphic. For expreſſing complex no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in this kind of writing, they had unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the parts and members of different ſpecies; and hence monſters and chimeras were added to the number of their gods.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD, therefore, of <q>finding mankind the more plunged into idolatry, the farther we mount up into antiquity; and no marks, no ſymptoms of any more perfect religion,</q> as has been confidently aſſerted<note n="*" place="bottom">Hume, ib.</note> to be clear from the teſtimony of hiſtory; we are aſſured by the oldeſt of hiſtories, that in the remoteſt antiquity a more perfect religion, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and worſhip of the One God, did prevail: and not only from it, but from the writings ſtill extant in every kind, we learn with certainty, that from this religion mankind deviated only by degrees, and were not plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the loweſt degradations of idolatry but in the courſe of ages. In Greece, the polythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm of the heroic times was, for its purity and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0224400400:18"/>
moral influence, venerable in compariſon with the maſs of ſuperſtitions, which compoſed its religion in its moſt civilized and enlightened periods.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE next true religion given to the world, was the Jewiſh. It may be viewed in two different lights; as the religious ſyſtem of the Hebrew nation; and as a preparation for the Chriſtian diſpenſation. In reſpect of both it was, by the Jews, gradually corrupted from its original purity: but with circumſtances ſo different, that it will be neceſſary to mark them ſeparately.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERED in the former light, it contains that ſyſtem of belief and that body of laws and worſhip, which Moſes delivered to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites: and it was completed by the digeſt which he gave them; all ſucceeding prieſts and prophets and rulers being only the guardians, the interpreters, or the executioners of it, but having no authority to alter or to add to it. The Moſaical religion, viewed in this light, was, The acknowledgment of the One God, as both the God of the univerſe, and their peculiar God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0224400400:19"/>
and righteous Governour; and the worſhip of him by a multifarious ceremonial, accurately determined by his authority.</p>
            <p>It was by the intermixture of idolatry, that the Iſraelites corrupted the purity of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They began with worſhiping God by an image; and that very early: the golden "calf," the Egyptian repreſentative of Oſiris, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on Aaron to "faſhion" for a viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of Jehovah <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxxii. 1, &amp;c.</note>. They did not long diſcontinue the impiety. When the mother of Micah had founded ſilver into images, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded this as "dedicating it to Jehovah <note n="†" place="bottom">Judg. xvii. 3.</note>:" when Micah had got "a Levite" to officiate as "prieſt" before his images, he confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf, on that account, the favour of Jehovah <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ver. 13.</note>. By this prieſt, the children of Dan "aſked counſel of Jehovah: <note n="§" place="bottom">Chap. xviii. 5, 6.</note>" they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried him away with the images, and ſet them up; and "Jonathan" the grandſon of Moſes, "and his ſons," continued for a long time the "prieſts" in this idolatrous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ver. 18,—30.</note>. This worſhip of the true God by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0224400400:20"/>
images, was eſtabliſhed in the kingdom of Iſrael, by the "calves" which, for preventing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from going out of its territory to worſhip, were "ſet up at Dan and Bethel <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings xii. 26, &amp;c.</note>:" and it continued as long as that kingdom ſtood.—The introduction of images brought along with it the uſe of other forbidden modes. Co-eval with it was their worſhipping in forbidden places: <q>the houſe of the Lord was at Shilo, all the time</q> that <q>Jonathan and his ſons were prieſts</q> to the tribe of Dan <note n="†" place="bottom">Judg. xviii. 30, 31.</note>: the temple was at Jeruſalem, when the ten tribes ſacrificed to their idols in the two extremities of their country: their "high places," their "mountains," their "groves," and their "green trees," are frequently mentioned with cenſure. In time they adopted likewiſe "rites" diſallowed by their law, mixing with their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God, ceremonies which their neighbours uſed in ſerving falſe gods.</p>
            <p>They were not content with theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: they took falſe gods into partnerſhip with Jehovah, and worſhipped them in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him. While they were yet <q>in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0224400400:21"/>
wilderneſs, they joined themſelves into Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peor, and bowed down to the gods of Moab, and did eat of their ſacrifices <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xxv. 2, 3.

Yet they went forward in it, till at length <q>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of their cities, were the Gods of Judah, and according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, their altars to burn incenſe unto Baal <note n="§" place="bottom">Jer. xi. 13.</note>.</q> They ceaſed not, till they placed their images in the temple itſelf "to defile it <note n="‖" place="bottom">Chap. vii. 30. xxxii. 34.</note>."—They multiplied their idolatrous ceremonies of worſhip, in full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0224400400:22"/>
to the multitude of their idols. They ſtudiouſly collected and eagerly adopted the moſt abominable rites of all the ſpecies of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheiſm, practiſed by any of the nations with which they were acquainted; uniting together their moſt diſcordant uſages, <q>ſlaying the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the vallies under the clifts of the rocks <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lxvii, 5.</note>; cakes to the queen of heaven, and drink-offerings unto other gods <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. vii. 16.</note>, cutting themſelves <note n="‡" place="bottom">Chap. xli. 5.</note>, making their ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to paſs through the fire to Molech <note n="§" place="bottom">Chap. xxxii. 35.</note>; every form of creeping things and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable beaſts, weeping for Tammuz, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſun towards the eaſt <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ezek. viii. 10, 14, 16.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ſo depraved they had become, that a little before the captivity they ſeem to have thought of renouncing the true God altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſining themſelves to the worſhip of falſe gods; for they ſaid, <q>We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to ſerve wood and ſtone <note n="¶" place="bottom">Chap. xx. 32.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By their captivity in Babylon, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cured of their propenſity to idolatry, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0224400400:23"/>
brought back to their original theology.—But what was conſequent on this, gives a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our propoſition: for this renovat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion they ſoon began<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>to corrupt, and have perſiſted in progreſſively corrupting, though in a different manner. While the Sadducees ſprung up, ſceptics or infidels with reſpect to important articles of faith, the reſt plunged themſelves into ſuperſtition or fanaticiſm. They magnified their ceremonial law, and reſted in it more and more: they incumbered it with new rites, and additional circumſtances of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance. They ſubtilized on their moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, till they explained them away, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them compatible with every vice. They ſet themſelves to invent traditions, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed them r apidly, and they yielded them higher and higher reverence, till they <q>made the commandment and word of God of none effect, by their tradition <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xv. 6. Mark vii. 13.</note>.</q> They became acquainted with the learning and philoſophy of the eaſt; they intermixed its <q>fables and genealogies <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 4. Tit. i. 14. iii. 9.</note>
               </q> with their religion, and by the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0224400400:24"/>
intermixture ſophiſticated the doctrines and perverted the morals which the ſcripture taught.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERED in the ſecond light, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Chriſtian diſpenſation, the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh religion, beſides the types involved in its ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, and the notices of the deſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which had been given before the time of Moſes, comprehended a long ſeries of prophecies concerning it, was gradually reared by their unfolding more and more the nature of that diſpenſation, and was completed only when Malachi the laſt of the prophets had written. It is from that period, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this part of the religion of the Iſraelites commenced: and it has become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.</p>
            <p>Miſunderſtanding their ſcriptures, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking many prophetical intimations, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded themſelves that their religion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and in all its parts unchangeable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual. Poſſeſſed by this idea, they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no uſe for a Meſſiah, but to extend it to all nations: and warped by worldly paſſions, they ſuppoſed that he would effectuate this, as a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0224400400:25"/>
glorious and triumphant prince, exalting them to the ſummit of temporal proſperity, and bringing the whole earth into ſubjection to them. Miſled by theſe falſe notions, by them explaining whatever ſeemed reconcileable, and neglecting whatever was repugnant, they were led into greater miſconception of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. They found not in Jeſus the character which they expected; they rejected and they cruciſied him.</p>
            <p>They have remained ſtubborn. They were early accuſed of eraſing ſome predictions; they have been often charged with wilfully falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome paſſages. The charge has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried too far: but that in a few inſtances they have attempted it, that in more they have purpoſely preferred falſe readings caſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, to ſuch as are unqueſtionably ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, but more favourable to Chriſtianity, there ſeems to be evidence. It is certain that Daniel, whom their fathers ranked among the prophets, and from whom alone they learned the name MESSIAH, they have, only becauſe his predictions are the moſt preciſe, for many ages denied to be a prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0224400400:26"/>
In perverting the meaning of the prophecies, they have been indefatigable. The cleareſt predictions concerning the Meſſiah and his kingdom, and by the Jews before his coming owned to be clear, they ſoon after began to deny, and have perſiſted in denying to have any relation to him; many which even their own early traditions refer to him, their later writers wreſt from their intent: And they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to other perſons and events, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they cannot agree among themſelves, but in none of which imagination itſelf can find them verified; nay to events forged on purpoſe to ſerve as an accompliſhment of them, and which may be diſproved from their own traditions.—Having deviſed ſuch ſemblances of their accompliſhment in others, they deny that they give any intimation of the Meſſiah. While in the plaineſt parts of Scripture, hiſtory and precept, the nature of which can admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond the obvious literal meaning, they are licentious in deducing myſteries, the moſt chimerical and ridiculous, from letters, and points, and caſual or capricious modes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of writing; they obſtinately deny that in prophecy, the nature of which admits
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0224400400:27"/>
and even invites it, there are any ſecondary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, any intimations, under types, of a higher archetype; nay, they inſiſt on interpreting lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expreſſions evidently figurative and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical, the import of which is clearly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the whole analogy of ſcripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. In the predictions of the Meſſiah's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they can perceive only worldly greatneſs; but neither the important object of his firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, nor the majeſty of his ſecond. They deny that his kingdom can be ſpiritual, becauſe its whole nature was not as preciſely and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly predefined by the prophets, as it could be delineated by himſelf.</p>
            <p>For eluding the force of prophecy, they have ſtuck at no expedient. To reconcile to their ideas, predictions of ſufferings and death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the plaineſt terms, deſcribed in the moſt circumſtantial manner, and unequivocally pointed to the Meſſiah, they ages ſince deviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fiction, contradictory to traditions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by themſelves, of two Meſſiahs. All the predictions concerning the reception of the Gentiles to equal privileges with themſelves, they have diluted into notices that the nations were to be their ſubjects. They have liſtened
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0224400400:28"/>
to one impoſtor after another, without a ſingle feature of the true Meſſiah: they have fixed aera after aera for his appearance: Diſappointed in them all, they contrive unſubſtantial reaſons for its being delayed: and while they convert the abſolute predictions of his coming into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſes, they miſinterpret the promiſe of their being bleſſed in him, clearly ſuſpended on the condition of their receiving him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with intimations, owned by their early doctors, that but a ſmall part of Iſrael would be actually ſaved by him, into abſolute predictions of their univerſal ſalvation; the failure of which they hold forth as a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he is not yet come.</p>
            <p>To fortify themſelves in unbelief, they have not ſcrupled to extenuate the idolatry of their anceſtors; to pronounce outward ceremonial worſhip more excellent than inward piety and moral virtue; to affirm that the Meſſiah was promiſed ſolely as a king, not as a law-giver, nor ſo much as to reveal any thing new; to deny that they are required, in order to their ſalvation, to believe in him when he comes: and indeed they leave ſcarcely any foundation in the prophecies, for themſelves or their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0224400400:29"/>
ever expecting that a Meſſiah was to come.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE third true religion is the Chriſtian. The New teſtament exhibits it in its purity. That it has been grievouſly corrupted, infidels glory in proclaiming, and Chriſtians are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerned to diſſemble. Every hiſtory of the church bears teſtimony to the fact, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſes the nature and the progreſs of its depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. In a caſe of ſuch notoriety, a very brief ſketch will be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>By being blended with the ideas and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of falſe philoſophy, the ſimple doctrines of the Goſpel began very early to be adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. From that philoſophy, ſubtileties were borrowed for defining them with preciſion, and hypotheſes for explaining them; and new ones were continually invented. Diſcordant defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were adopted, and tenaciouſly maintained. Controverſies concerning them were agitated with heat, and debated with all the arts of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied acuteneſs. Every controverſy produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contradictory deciſions by thoſe who equally uſurped authority to fix the faith of Chriſtians. Every deciſion engendered new controverſies,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0224400400:30"/>
and inflamed ſiercer contentions. Inveſtigation was ſtretched to inquiries above the reach of man, and proſtituted to frivolous queſtions and logomachies unworthy of his notice. By ſuch deciſions as had the good fortune to predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, new creeds were continually fabricated; new terms of diſtinction conſecrated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the heads of doctrine, the articles of faith, unreaſonably multiplied; many falſe doctrines eſtabliſhed. To give them ſupport, divine authority was more and more attributed to human writings; and all the jargon of ſcholaſtic metaphyſics, and all the ſophiſtry of dialectics, were laboriouſly employed.</p>
            <p>In proportion as the doctrines of the goſpel were tortured from their original ſimplicity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endleſs intricacies of frigid refinement, they became unſit for touching the heart or influencing the practice, for ſerving as motives to holineſs, as roots from which piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue might derive nouriſhment and vigour. The precepts, likewiſe, of the Goſpel, whoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity gives them a venerable dignity and a commanding authority, were explained and analized with a dry minuteneſs, better calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for perplexing the underſtanding, than for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0224400400:31"/>
impreſſing them on the conſcience. They were avowedly evaded by maxims of looſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſtry; and their obligation ſuperſeded by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious commutations, penances, indulgences, and diſpenſations. Perfection was placed, not in ſubſtantial goodneſs, but in celibacy, mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, voluntary auſterities, and unnatural mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications.</p>
            <p>The ſimple worſhip of Chriſtianity was ſoon deformed by the admixture, firſt of Jewiſh, and next of Pagan ceremonies. Baptiſm and the euchariſt were adminiſtered with empty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry and idle mummery; they were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into terrific myſteries; new virtues were aſcribed to them; new pomp was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſolemnizing them; the corruption of the latter iſſued in the monſter, tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To the few rites enjoined by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, many were added; and from unneceſſary, they became abominable: from <q>glorying in the croſs of Chriſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. vi. 14.</note>,</q> they paſſed to uſing the ſign of it, as a charm, on all occaſions; from praying for the dead, they proceeded to pray to them; from commemorating the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0224400400:32"/>
to worſhip them; from reſpecting their relics, to adore them, and to indue them with the power of miracles; from tolerating pictures and images, firſt to place them in churches, and afterwards to fall down before them. Faſts and feſtivals without number were ſucceſſively inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. Prayers, in the beginning ſhort and artleſs, were extended into complex liturgies, infected with all the niceties and errors of their faith.</p>
            <p>The genuine ſpirit of Chriſtianity has been no leſs wofully depraved. The Apoſtles, though inſpired, claimed no "dominion over faith <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. i. 24.</note>;" they inſiſted on the reception only of what was clearly revealed; they gave indulgence to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man weakneſs in whatever affected not the very eſſence of religion <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 1, &amp;c. Phil. iii. 15, 16.</note>; they reſerved their ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas for obſtinate wickedneſs. But they who came after them, from almoſt the earlieſt time, have impoſed upon others their own precarious opinions, their determinations concerning what is not revealed; their far-fetched deductions from Scripture; and even the technical terms which they had coined for expreſſing them.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0224400400:33"/>
They have ſeparated from, and excommunicated, one another for the moſt trifling, nay for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal differences; and, while they were indulgent to crimes, denounced damnation againſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were pleaſed to denominate hereſy.—As ſoon as the converſion of the emperors put it in their power, the leaders of the church graſped at riches, dignities, and political influence. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical orders were multiplied: the biſhops aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a high rank: archbiſhops and patriarchs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted themſelves above them: each ſee was not only ſcrambled for with indecent ambition, but purchaſed by the baſeſt arts; and one ſee contended with another, for pre-eminence to flatter pride, and power to domineer.—In all the churches theſe evils grew, till the dexterous and perſevering efforts of the biſhop of Rome raiſed him to ſupremacy over moſt of them, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the kings of the world to his nod, made him the vicar of Chriſt, a god upon earth, and veſted him with abſolute dominion, which he moſt aſſiduouſly exerciſed in tyrannizing over all, in diſturbing the peace, and diſſolving the laws of ſociety, in authorizing all former cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and making great additions to them in enforcing them by perſecutions, maſſacres,

and wars, in degrading religion into an engine of the moſt unrighteous policy.</p>
            <p>In a word, from ſmall beginnings, number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs corruptions, aided by centuries of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, grew up into that <q>myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. ii. 7.</note>,</q> which formed the predominant reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at the Reformation, the total depravation of which is ſo well known, and ſo explicitly confeſſed by popiſh writers themſelves, that I may ſpare myſelf the pain of attempting the odious portrait.</p>
            <p>THUS every religion that has any claim to truth, has been in time corrupted.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE SECOND part of our propoſition, That all falſe religions have, in time, been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and improved, is equally true; and, ſo far as our preſent deſign requires it, may be more briefly evinced. Each of the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we have mentioned, having at length acquired a determinate ſhape, became a falſe religion, for ſome time prevalent, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and unqueſtioned. But in the progreſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0224400400:35"/>
of inquiry and knowledge, they have been all examined, cleared in ſome meaſure from the groſſneſs which they had gradually contracted, and reduced to a leſs exceptionable form.</p>
            <p n="1">1. TO begin with paganiſm. The Egyptian worſhip of brutes and vegetables aſtoniſhed the inquiſitive: it ſhocked the idolaters of other ſects; it was oftener than once legally proſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Romans, who gloried in adopting the gods and the rites of all nations, as a token of their piety and the cauſe of their proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: it could ſcarcely fail ſometimes to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger its own votaries. They extenuated its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, by reſolving the ignoble objects of their adoration into mere emblems both of hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods and of the celeſtial bodies, the divinities acknowledged by all idolaters. Emblems they had originally been: but by ingenuity in illuſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſignificance, they were rendered more plauſible than at their introduction, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as even more refined and expreſſive images of the gods, than the idols ſet up by other pagans.</p>
            <p>THE worſhip of dead men, however implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and extenſively practiſed, could not, naked
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0224400400:36"/>
and undiſguiſed, eſcape condemnation as ſoon as it had excited the curioſity of thinking men. Even the ſymbolical images of the Egyptians, it has been ſpeciouſly ſuppoſed, were contrived on purpoſe to veil the objectionable genealogies of the gods. To give that worſhip the ſairer appearance, ſpeculative men deviſed the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſouls, into human, heroic, and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac: when the gods were conceived, not as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mortals, but as Superior Beings who had deigned to viſit the earth for the ſake of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and lived only to heap bleſſings on them, there was a ſhew of reaſon in paying them reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious honours. This hypotheſis was, however, contradicted by their mythology, which proved their gods to have been mere men, often not of the worthieſt kind; and the authority of their admired poets had early rendered this too ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to be rejected: but they explained it away, and repreſented the popular hiſtories of the gods as only ingenious allegories, ſhadowing forth moral or phyſical truths.</p>
            <p>AT an early period, in the moſt civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the eaſt, the more enlightened worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the celeſtial bodies reformed the received
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0224400400:37"/>
idolatry, ſo far as to confine their adoration to the ſun, and, reprobating images, to addreſs him by no other medium but fire.—When, in other nations, the elements, and even the moſt ſplendid luminaries were, by the reſearches of philoſophers, aſcertained to be inanimate, the worſhip of them required a vindication: and it was attempted by the refinement of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it, not to the material maſs, but to the intelligent divinity who inhabited and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
            <p>BUT none of the forms of paganiſm, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever each of them might be diſguiſed, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the abſurdities of them all might be ſhuſſled out of ſight by involving them in confuſion, blending them together, and deriving ſupport to one from another in their turns, could bear the ſcrutiny of enlightened minds. Without entering into the controverted import of the myſteries, we may remark that the ſpeculations of the old philoſophers of Greece forced them to acknowledge One ſupreme God, diſtinct from all the vulgar deities, though along with him they continued to admit theſe. But the luſtre of religious truth diffuſed by the goſpel,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0224400400:38"/>
conſtrained the later philoſophers to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him as the Only God; and, determined as they were not to relinquiſh the popular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to endeavour by a new refinement to render it conſiſtent with that acknowledgment. Even the brute-gods of Egypt were made only emblematical of his ſeveral attributes; the fables of their hero-gods, but parabolical hiſtories of his providence; the deiſied parts of nature, no more than his ſenſible repreſentatives; all their rites, a varied ſervice to him under different names, or different ideas. Their idolatries thus explained away by a reference to the true God, gave paganiſm the moſt unexceptionable form of which it was capable.—In ſome countries, this refinement reſted not with philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. Whether in an early age, by means of the Jewiſh ſcriptures, or at a later era, by the publication of the Alcoran, the Magian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the eaſt was much reformed; one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and eternal God introduced; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of him alone eſtabliſhed by books account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divine; and eſtabliſhed ſo firmly that its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, though full of ſuperſtitions, continue to deteſt idolatry, and proſeſſedly worſhip before the fire or towards the riſing ſun, only as the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0224400400:39"/>
pureſt types of the Divinity. Nay in almoſt all the popular religions of Aſia, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that, amidſt numberleſs abſurdities, and idolatrous uſages, One God is ultimately adored.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE religion of the Iſraelites ſophiſticated as it was by idolatry, before the captivity, may juſtly be called falſe. From that idolatry, it has ever ſince been completely purged: and their preſent ritual, with all its deformities, is far preferable to the heatheniſh inventions of their anceſtors.—Whether, or how far, the doctrine of the Jews concerning the Meſſiah, has been amended ſince their rejection of him, it is unneceſſary to examine. As their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is founded on the moſt rooted prejudices and the moſt determined miſunderſtanding of the prophecies, it is only from very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary events that their converſion can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and till it take place there can be little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in their ſentiments concerning Chriſt. For this, the predicted time is not yet come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when it comes, their converſion will be perfect; all their errors will be relinquiſhed; as national, their religion will ceaſe; as divine,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0224400400:40"/>
all of it that was intended permanent will be reduced to the purity of the ſcripture: and even to the Chriſtian world, <q>the receiving of them will be life from the dead <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xi. 15.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. WHEN from the accumulated corruptions of Chriſtianity, through a ſeries of ages, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery had ſprung up, and reached its maturity, the abſurdities and abuſes with which it abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, began at length to be diſcovered. By the revival of learning, and by the application of it to an examination of the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem, its errors have been much corrected.</p>
            <p>Even by thoſe who ſtill adhered to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, it has been in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. Some of its doctrines have been expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly renounced; ſome of them explained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; many of them ſoftened. Some of its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions have been diſclaimed; ſome ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fall into diſuſe; others ſtript of part of their pageantry. The ſaints have been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as not invocated for the benefit of their merits, but only entreated for their prayers; images, as not themſelves objects of worſhip,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0224400400:41"/>
but merely helps to a lively conception and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the perſon whom they portray. Indulgences are more ſparingly dealt out, leſs eagerly ſought after, and their efficacy is leſs extolled.—The ſpirit of popery has been melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. The reading of the ſcriptures has been more freely permitted to the people; and by vernacular verſions and expoſitions, means are ſupplied for their better underſtanding them. Every where the horrors of the inquiſition have have been mitigated; in ſome places they have ceaſed. Among the moſt bigotted nations, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions which once would have been repreſſed by the executioner, begin to be ventured on with impunity, and liſtened to without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: and in nations more enlightened, free inquiry is encouraged and purſued with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. A liberal toleration has been, not only recommended by the learned, and granted by diſcerning princes, but approved by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, practiſed by prieſts, and even indulged by popes. Their authority, both ſpiritual and temporal, has come to be very faintly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and very cautiouſly exerciſed. Some religious orders, uſeleſs or noxious, have been ſuppreſſed, and others reſtricted, or reformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0224400400:42"/>
But among thoſe who ſeparated from the church of Rome, a far more important reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pure Chriſtianity has taken place. By the firſt reformers, the ſcripture was recogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the only rule of religious faith and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: and to the inveſtigation of its genuine ſenſe they applied all the means of which they were poſſeſſed, with ſucceſs in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances aſtoniſhing. They exploded all the groſſeſt errors; and the purity of the doctrine, worſhip, and morals, which all of them eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, though not untainted, was ſufficient to put to ſhame the church which they forſook. That they ſhould accompliſh ſo much, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; that they ſhould have effected a perfect reformation would have been miraculous.—They could not rid themſelves of every preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: to ſome errors they remained attached; by their deteſtation of others they were driven into an oppoſite extreme. They were deſtitute of many advantages for interpreting the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and their opinions were biaſſed by a falſe philoſophy. They attempted too preciſe definitions of ſpeculative tenets; they dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically decided dubious points of doctrine: they were unreaſonably tenacious of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0224400400:43"/>
deciſions; they were too eaſily and too deeply irritated by contradiction to theſe: by aiming at an impracticable uniformity, they broke that union which they ought to have preſerved. By an abuſe of liberty, to which they who have newly acquired it are ever prone, crude conceits, wild notions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant practices were ſometimes vented; and ſects founded on them, ſome of which, after flaſhing for a while, vaniſhed away, and ſome, throwing off the groſſer matter, have aſſumed a more decent form.—All the defects of the firſt reformation are not yet ſupplied; many cauſes have concurred in preventing it: but ſome of them have been in part removed; and for the removal of them all, there ſeems to be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py preparation. New means of elucidating ſcripture are every day diſcovered and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: there is a very general diſpoſition among proteſtants to examine with impartiality what it really teaches: the fallible determinations and deductions of men are leſs implicitly revered: ſome doctrines have come to be explained more ſoberly: many frivolous controverſies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, and the more important queſtions are often debated with coolneſs and candour: leſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0224400400:44"/>
ſtreſs is laid on the minute diſtinctions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and many of every party have learned to judge equitably of others, and to converſe ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably with them. Though this be not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally the ſtate of things in the proteſtant churches, it is ſo in a conſiderable degree: and though the extenſion of it may be checked at times, there is reaſon to believe that it will not be finally ſtopped. In the courſe of free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, errors cannot but be broached; the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of men, it may be, can never permit their exemption from every miſtake, or prevent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difference of ſentiment: but by the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained progreſſion of ſuch inquiry, we truſt that all the really important truths of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will in time be irrefragably aſcertained and unanimouſly acknowledged; that Chriſtians will harmoniouſly acquieſce in theſe; and that, diſregarding other things, they will concur in conſidering and uſing Chriſtianity, as a ſyſtem of ſimple principles revealed for the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the conſolation, and the ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THERE is another falſe religion, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan impoſture; which claims our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0224400400:45"/>
the more, becauſe it ſeems at firſt ſight unfavourable to our poſition, but on inſpecting the peculiarity of its origin and ſtructure, will turn out a remarkable confirmation of it. We had no occaſion to mention it under the former head; for it was not a natural and gradual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of any one true religion. It was a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died compoſition from Judaiſm, Chriſtianity, and the heathen ſuperſſitions of Arabia, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and formed by one man, and fixed by a written ſtandard. Being in its original a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from religions true and falſe, its progreſs, as might have been expected, has participated in the fates of both.</p>
            <p>Since religions wholly true have always been in time depraved, what this impoſture had in common with them, already in the firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tainted, could not but be liable to farther depravation. Having a definite ſtandard, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes naturally aroſe about its meaning, and produced a ſeparation into ſects which ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Including principles of general truth, there came of courſe ſpeculations, diſcuſſions, and queſtions concerning them; and theſe would have been more frequent if its votaries had abounded more in curioſity or ingenuity.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0224400400:46"/>
Mahomet had borrowed from the ſcriptures; many moral precepts in tolerable purity; but ſome of them have been debaſed by his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In the beginning, he claimed a right only to admoniſh and perſuade; but he ſoon ſtript his religion of this gentle ſpirit, by declaring himſelf authoriſed to compel aſſent and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all oppoſers, and commanding his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to do the ſame. Their hatred of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity has ſometimes led them to deny things favourable to it, which he admitted. Many parts of the Alcoran are corruptions of ſcripture hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: if theſe have been more corrupted ſince; if multitudes of fables have been added to them; or if tenets originally falſe, have been rendered more abſurd; if, for example, a ſenſual paradiſe has been deſcribed in more diſſolute terms; this is only that declenſion from bad to worſe, which has happened in all falſe religions during the prevalence of ignorance, and gone on till they reached the extremeſt point of their dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy.—Mahomet alleged no open miracles in ſupport of his miſſion, and appealed not to any clear prediction of him in the extant ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: ought we to reckon it a deteriora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a melioration of his ſcheme, that his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0224400400:47"/>
followers have marked his birth and early life with prodigies and preſages, aſcribed to him thouſands of miracles, and attempted to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intimations of his coming in the bible as it ſtands? Being fictions, they add to the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Mahometaniſm: could they be made plauſible, they would ſupply its total want of evidence.</p>
            <p>But ſome real amendments it has unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably received. They were begun even by its author: having employed more than twenty years in completing the Alcoran, he corrected errors in what had been firſt written, reſolved difficulties, and obviated objections; and ſalved the practice from the charge of inconſiſtency, by giving the reſult of his maturer reflection or growing experience, as new revelations revok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former ones. His followers have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to reconcile ſome of the contradictions which were left remaining in it: they have ſoftened or explained away ſome of its moſt glaring abſurdities, as its excluſion of women from paradiſe. They have ſupplied many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in its laws, and in many caſes the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the doctors are better than the text. Mahomet enjoined his followers to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0224400400:48"/>
extirpate all other religions by the ſword, and for ſome time they executed the mandate in its utmoſt rigour: but even the ferocious Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens ſoon adopted leſs bloody maxims; the Perſians lay other religions under very moderate reſtraints; and the Turks have indulged tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſo far that, in the very vicinity of their capital, a Chriſtian church has ſubſiſted for ages, oppreſſed indeed, though even this more from avarice than from religious zeal, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to retain its conſtitution and its worſhip, and to regulate its own concerns; nay, by ſome of their conqueſts, proteſtants have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the liberty and eaſe, of which the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry of papiſts had before totally deprived them.</p>
            <p>That this falſe religion has not been more extenſively reformed, during ſo conſiderable a length of time, may be eaſily accounted for. Its very nature tends to depreſs and contract the underſtanding; and the deſpotiſm which has conſtantly accompanied it, aggravates its effect. The powers of its votaries thus degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they can have little propenſity to inquiry or examination; and from this they are, though not abſolutely prohibited, yet ſtrongly diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0224400400:49"/>
by the maxims of their prophet and his ſucceſſors. They have been always involved in the profoundeſt ignorance, not only neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge, but deſpiſing it; and they are utter ſtrangers to thoſe parts of learning parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the leaſt ſmattering of which would expoſe the ſables, the ſalſities, and the blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Alcoran. Glimmerings of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge have led ſome of its adherents to detect its groſſeſt faults; and a general diffuſion of even the ſainteſt dawn of literature would lead them either to attempt reforming it, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it.</p>
            <p>Founded as this religion is in impoſture, and contaminated as it is in its compoſition, it has already, by the unſearchable wiſdom of God's providence, been over-ruled to produce many good effects; to put an end to idolatry in the country where it ſprung up, to improve the religions of Aſia, to ſpread far the doctrine of the divine unity; as well as to chaſtiſe the diviſions, the ſuperſtitions, and the vices of Chriſtians. True knowledge and learning will ſcarcely try to mend it; they will more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably diſcover its total falſehood, and explode it. And when we conſider, that it ſtrenuouſly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0224400400:50"/>
inculcates the firſt principle of true religion, One God; that it in ſome meaſure owns the the divine miſſion of Moſes, and of Jeſus Chriſt, and the original inſpiration of our ſcriptures; and that the ſlendereſt acquaintance with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and criticiſm will demonſtrate the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their being falſiſied, as well as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of its own fictions: On theſe grounds, without prying into the ſenſe of prophecies yet wrapt up in obſcurity, is it preſumptuous to indulge the hope, that this falſe religion will in time pave the way for the general reception of Chriſtianity by its numerous profeſſors, and that its having been permitted to overſpread ſo large a proportion of mankind, will in the end contribute to the bringing in of <q>the fulneſs of the gentiles <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xi. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>,</q> and to all <q>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world becoming the kingdom of our Lord and of his Chriſt <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xi. 15.</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN this world, nothing goes on with perfect equability; there are unevenneſſes and breaks in the moſt regular proceſſes of nature, and in the moſt connected ſeries of events; and every
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0224400400:51"/>
proceſs, every ſeries requires a certain ſpace of time for the completion of its courſe. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected that it ſhould be otherwiſe in religion: its motion, towards either corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or improvement, muſt be ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive, ſometimes interrupted, and ſometimes retrograde; ſometimes accelerated, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times checked or retarded, by a variety of cauſes: and it is only by tracing it through a large period, that we can determine its iſſue. But with theſe reſtrictions, neceſſary to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in judging of every caſe, it has, I think, been ſufficiently evinced, that true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are made worſe, and falſe religions bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in a conſiderable length of time.</p>
            <p n="3">III. LET us next point out the concluſions fairly deducible from the facts which we have eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>THAT all the corruptions which have been introduced into Chriſtianity, cannot warrant the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion of its truth, is a conſequence ſo clear and obvious, that it needs no illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the Jew attempts by them to vindicate his rejection of the goſpel, he muſt admit that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0224400400:52"/>
his own religion never came from God; for he cannot deny that it too has been at times cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The deiſt cannot urge the objection without exploding natural religion; for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into paganiſm: If it be true, though God, far from preſerving its purity, permitted this ſhameful degeneracy to overſpread the world, why may not Chriſtianity be alſo true, notwithſtanding the like ſeeming neglect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Had the objection any force, it would neceſſarily infer that there never was a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the world, and that atheiſm is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tenable and conſiſtent ſcheme.</p>
            <p>But from our detail of the fates of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent religions, we venture farther to conclude, that the very fact objected, Chriſtianity having been corrupted, yields ſome real preſumption of its truth. It is one feature which it has in common with all religions that have any claim to truth, and by which it differs from all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions indiſputably falſe. This ſingle feature is not ſufficient for abſolutely aſcertaining, but it ſurely gives ſome indication, to which of the two families it belongs.</p>
            <p>The indication, however ſlender when we attend to the mere fact, will become ſtronger
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0224400400:53"/>
and more unequivocal when we examine the reaſons of the fact. For we ſhall find that the contrariety of the fates of true and of falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, ariſes from the very nature of the thing.—True religions are the work of God, all whoſe plans, proceeding from his infinite perfection, muſt be pure and complete. It is therefore impoſſible that they can be improved by the wiſdom of man. But the weakneſs of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the power of his paſſions, ſcarcely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to adhere to them, preciſely as God gave them. Every deviation from them muſt be to the worſe; and it muſt, by biaſſing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and increaſing the impulſe of the paſſions, contribute to farther deviations; till they ſink into the greateſt degree of corruption which the vitiated faculties of their votaries can bear.—But falſe religions are the contrivances of men; and therefore, partaking in the errors and depravations of thoſe narrow and polluted conceptions from which they ſpring, they muſt be always capable of amendment. Every al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of men's ſentiments and views, though not implying conſiderable improvement, will diſcover ſome blemiſh which they find it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to remove from their religion. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0224400400:54"/>
as their underſtandings are improved, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and enlightened, they will advance to an ampler detection of its abſurdities, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to correct them by progreſſive refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; till at length the unſucceſsfulneſs of all their efforts determine them to abandon it. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the point of its extreme degeneracy, every falſe religion deſtroys itſelf.—If it be thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the nature of the thing, inevitable that true religions are gradually corrupted into ſuch as may be denominated falſe, and that theſe, after having been for ſome time ſtagnant, throw off their dregs and refine themſelves, is it not a real preſumption of the truth of Chriſtianity, that it has had theſe revolutions?</p>
            <p>If theſe concluſions be, as they appear to me, legitimate, the argument which I have ſtated will make ſome addition to the proofs of the truth and divinity of our holy religion. Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as it may be, taken by itſelf, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving of our regard: for the more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the proofs, eſpecially when they are educed from circumſtances untoward and unfavourable, the more irreſiſtibly they compel our aſſent, and ſix us in tranquil reliance, in ſpite of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0224400400:55"/>
cavils, on <q>the certainty of thoſe things wherein we have been inſtructed <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke i. 4.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT though our concluſions ſhould, in the judgment of ſome, have little force, no harm can, and ſome good may, ariſe from their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been propoſed. For all the great evidences of Chriſtianity continue unimpaired: and the facts in the hiſtory of religion, which have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under our notice, may, without our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them as inferring the truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, lead us into reflections far from uſeleſs; a few of which I beg leave to ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>In the whole hiſtory of religion, we cannot fail to obſerve, that all the corruptions of it have proceeded from the ignorance and the evil paſſions of men; and that every emendation of it has been produced by the diffuſion of knowledge, partly in conſequence of the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of reaſon, but principally owing to the ſuperior light of divine revelation. The obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation implies at once a ſtrong recommendation of learning and ſcience, and a convincing proof of the great utility and importance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0224400400:56"/>
And will it not warrant us in ſaying, that, ſince reaſon by itſelf was able to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in religion, much may be expected from the free and ſober exerciſe of it, illuminated and guided by revelation, and acting in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to it?</p>
            <p>Zealous have been the efforts of ſome, to baniſh Chriſtianity from the world. Suppoſe it poſſible that they ſhould ſucceed, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would they gain? Say ſome, the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> a name which they chooſe to give to all <hi>religion:</hi> But, not to inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this would be truly an advantage, the project is impracticable; for the conſtitution of man, and the whole hiſtory of mankind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to prove that univerſal atheiſm never can take place, and that human creatures will put up with the worſt form of religion, rather than have none. Others promiſe a happier conſequence, the introduction of natural religion in perfect purity. A ſyſtem of it, I ſhall not diſpute but they might compoſe; though it is only by the help of that revelation to which they return ſo little gratitude, for the wiſeſt of the ancients never could accompliſh it: But by what means are they to qualify the bulk of mankind for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0224400400:57"/>
into all their reaſonings? Or by what art will they induce them, without this, impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly to adopt their concluſions? Suppoſe it, however, introduced and univerſally eſtabliſhed; ſtill it could be only for a moment. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of paſt times demonſtrates that it would quickly degenerate into polytheiſm and idolatry: though the acknowledgement of the One God was, in the primeval religion, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a memorial of all other things being created by him, it did not long reſtrain them from worſhipping theſe as gods; and from this worſhip, the theiſm of the beſt philoſophers was not able to recover them. The nature of the thing corroborates the illation from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: Reaſon, it is juſtly obſerved by one of the acuteſt inſidels <note n="*" place="bottom">Hume, ib. § 2.</note>, can eſtabliſh the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of one God, only by careful attention to the ſignatures of his power and wiſdom in the works of nature; but the opinion of many gods ariſes from the paſſions naturally excited by feeling the effects of inviſible power in the varied and contrary events of human life: the latter are always more obvious, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0224400400:58"/>
than the former; and conſequently muſt create a continual propenſity to polytheiſm, which reaſon alone will be unable to curb. A project, therefore, to explode revelation, is in fact a project to bring the world back to the worſhip of ſtocks and ſtones: and whether it betrays greater narrowneſs of underſtanding, or defect of benevolence, it is not eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>From the detail of facts which we have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, it is plain that religion, in the hand of weak and fallible men, is always in danger of being corrupted. A reformation from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which it had once contracted, affords no ſecurity againſt its being again contaminated. No ſooner almoſt was Judaiſm purged from idolatry, than it degenerated anew by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of infidelity, myſticiſm, and ſuperſtition. Into the proteſtant religion, with which we are moſt nearly concerned, conſiderable ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes have ſometimes found their way. Though the reformers began with declaring ſcripture to be the only rule of faith, teaching what they thought agreeable to it, and calling upon all men to exerciſe their own judgment; yet to this fundamental principle of the reformation
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0224400400:59"/>
neither they nor their ſucceſſors have uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhered. They were upbraided, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh writers, with the uncertainty of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and importuned for a preciſe expoſition of their faith: they yielded to the clamour, and reduced their theology into formal ſyſtems. At firſt they propoſed them only as an anſwer to the demands of their opponents: but they quickly erected them into ſtandards of faith, and exacted a ſtrict conformity to them as a condition of communion. They conſiſted not of a ſeries of propoſitions clearly revealed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but too often included definitions reſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its words to the one ſenſe which they approved, far fetched and diſputable deductions from it, ſubtile explications of its ſimple prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and precarious hypotheſes for ſupporting them. The diverſity of theſe human ſyſtems occaſioned controverſies; the authority aſcribed to each of them inflamed the ſpirit of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ſierceneſs of contention produced ſchiſms: and both attachment to a particular party, and abhorrence of it, biaſſed the minds of men from impartiality in ſearching the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In the colliſion of ſects and parties, ſome, from exceſſive deference to human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0224400400:60"/>
reverted nearer to the degenerate church which they had forſaken; ſome affected too much a contrariety in every point; ſome conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated dogmas evidently unſcriptural; ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained away tenets really founded in the bible; and many laid greater ſtreſs on the diſtinctive notions of a ſect, than on active faith in the ſimple practical principles of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>To ſome depravation, our religion will be ever liable by reaſon of the infirmities of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. While they think that they are maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in its purity, they may be only holding faſt ſome error from which it has not hitherto been wholly purged. While they mean only to caſt off the remains of error, they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing new errors. Our duty is, to employ the beſt precautions for eſcaping from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which we cannot ceaſe to be expoſed. However much Chriſtianity may be at times depraved, it always carries along with it the means of its reſtoration. As the ſun has in himſelf unvaried brightneſs, and power to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the clouds which often obſcure his light in its tranſmiſſion to the earth; ſo the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, always pure and always the ſame, exhibit genuine Chriſtianity, and afford the means of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0224400400:61"/>
rectifying the groſſeſt miſconceptions of it. To them let us always have recourſe; to their ſole authority let us bend. Let us honeſtly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſeek the truth, as it is in them; let us reſt ſatisfied with the plain and ſanctifying views of the great principles of religion, which they preſent; let us give no indulgence to falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in refining on them. Let us deſpiſe all frivolous and unedifying queſtions; let us labour, only by the "doctrine" of the goſpel to cheriſh that "goodneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 3.</note>" which is its end. Purſuing this courſe, our religion will be as pure as the weakneſs of our faculties permits; and, notwiſtanding its defects, will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Jeſus Chriſt, by him who <q>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our frame <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. ciii. 14.</note>.</q> Would all purſue this courſe, the religion of the Chriſtian world would aſſume a better face: it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, not as a ſubject of diſputation, but as the art of holy living; each man, ſenſible of his own fallibility in applying the inſallible rule of faith, would give ready indulgence to the opinions of others; the diſcontinuance of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative diſcuſſions would unite all more nearly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0224400400:62"/>
in the ſame faith; they would renounce invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious names of diſtinction; they would glory only in the name of Chriſtians; and under this name would form a great ſociety <q>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, having the ſame love, of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, of one mind <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. ii. 2.</note>,</q> ſtriving together to render their "converſation" ſuch <q>as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the goſpel of Chriſt <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. i. 27.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I MAKE no digreſſion from the ſubject on which I have all along inſiſted, when I now turn my diſcourſe to the preſent occaſion, the meeting of the Society in Scotland for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Chriſtian Knowledge. The very object of its inſtitution is, at once to bring thoſe to the knowledge of Chriſtianity, who before had no opportunity of learning it; and to impart it in greater purity to thoſe who poſſeſſed only the moſt adulterated form of it. This noble ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the plan of the Society leads them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue by the only legitimate and proper means, inſtruction. They have wiſely directed their firſt endeavours to what promiſes the beſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, inſtilling religious principles and good
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0224400400:63"/>
habits into the ſuſceptible minds of the young: but they have not neglected what they had it in their power to do, for recovering thoſe who had long been enſlaved by error and ſuperſtition. By procuring tranſlations of the ſacred books, into the only language generally underſtood in many corners of the kingdom, they have given to multitudes an opportunity of drawing reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious knowledge from the unpolluted fountains of truth, and of continually improving in it by their own application. They have extended their views to the propagation of the goſpel, by the like proper means, in remote regions of the earth, wherever the vicinity of fellow-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants gave any favourable opening. It is by ſuch means only, that true religion has ever been ſpread, or corruptions of it effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: it is by ſuch means only, that theſe events can in any caſe be reaſonably expected. God forbid that they who wiſh, or who exert themſelves, for the prevalence of true religion, ſhould at any time ſo far miſtake their way, as to approve or aid a reſtraint on the profeſſion of of the falſeſt, by the terror of civil laws, or the ſmart of penalties. Nothing could more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the accompliſhment of their wiſh or the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0224400400:64"/>
efficacy of their exertions. Such engines may impoſe ſilence or force a feigned compliance: but they often irritate to ſtiffer oppoſition; and they never can produce conviction or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No, Chriſtians: <q>the weapons of our warfare are not carnal;</q> their temper is from heaven: and if we do not hurt it by the baſe alloy of human policy, they will be <q>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. x. 4.</note>.</q> When the good ends are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, for which the inſcrutable providence of God has permitted <q>the man of ſin to exalt himſelf, the Lord ſhall conſume him by the ſpirit and words of his mouth <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. ii. 8. Hoſ. vi. 5.</note>.</q> To this happy event, there are every where clear and quick advances: and the efforts of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety are well calculated for accelerating it, ſo far as their influence extends.</p>
            <p>On the manner in which the Society have employed the legitimate means of promoting the knowledge of the goſpel, it is unneceſſary for me to expatiate. Of the uniform integrity of their intentions, the regular publications of their proceedings, ſtating the ſimple facts, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0224400400:65"/>
the miſcarriages as well as the ſucceſſes of their plans, evidence the fulleſt conſciouſneſs in themſelves, and give others the faireſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judging. On the prudence and rectitude of their management, the continual and growing encouragement with which they meet, is the beſt encomium. The pious perſons who plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the inſtitution ſaw <q>multitudes fainting and ſcattered abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſheep having no ſhepherd;</q> and in the ſpirit of their divine maſter <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. ix. 36, 37, 38.</note>, they were <q>moved with compaſſion on them. The harveſt truly was plenteous, but the labourers were</q> very "few." With pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to <q>the lord of the harveſt, that he would ſend forth labourers,</q> they united their own zealous exertions to procure them. The funds which they could command for this purpoſe, bore no proportion to the greatneſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: and from the nature and ſituation of the country, from the rude ſtate of ſociety and manners, from prejudices both political and religious, numberleſs obſtructions aroſe in the execution of it. Yet their earlieſt attempts were not fruitleſs. The exertions of thoſe who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0224400400:66"/>
came after them have been perſerving; they have had extenſive ſucceſs; and there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope for ſtill greater ſucceſs. Some of the obſtructions are removed, others are much diminiſhed; and for ſurmounting the reſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantages are obtained. Society has advanced to a more improved ſtate; the laws every where operate with becoming energy; peace, ſecurity, and order are introduced; the political prejudices are extirpated, and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious mitigated <note n="*" place="bottom">The lateſt <hi>Abſtract of the Proceedings of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> (page 61.) contains a fact which affords a ſtriking evidence of this, That ſome proprietors of lands, of the Roman Catholic profeſſion, have promiſed to give all countenance and ſupport to the teachers appointed by the Society.</note>: Induſtry has taken place of idleneſs, partly by the meaſure which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety has long proſecuted in ſubordination to its principal object, the education of young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the moſt neceſſary and uſeful arts of common life, and partly by the ample encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and aſſiſtance which Government has given to the improvement of the Highlands; and means have been projected, which promiſe fair for carrying it forward with rapidity. Every
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0224400400:67"/>
degree of ſucceſs which has attended the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Society, removes ſome obſtruction, and leaves the leſs to be accompliſhed. For accompliſhing what remains, there are at the ſame time more abundant means: the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of ſmaller donations, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, is far from inconſiderable: there have been, and there will ſometimes be, large be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: the munificent gift recently beſtowed, in a manner which precludes acknowledgments from men, but will not miſs reward from that God whoſe higheſt approbation attends the unoſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious exerciſe of pure benevolence and piety, gives the immediate means of extending the uſefulneſs of this inſtitution far beyond its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent limits; and will doubtleſs be faithfully and wiſely employed for that purpoſe. A purpoſe ſo important, let the rich promote by willing communications from their treaſures, thoſe whoſe ſituation admits it by their aſſiſting la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and all by their fervent prayers. To God muſt be aſcribed all paſt ſucceſſes; on him muſt ultimately depend all future ſucceſs. May he ever direct thoſe to whom ſo great a truſt is committed, grant a bleſſing on their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,

            <p>IT is with ſingular ſatisfaction that the Directors have it in their power to begin the ſtatement of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings for the preſent year, with the account of an acceſſion to the funds of the Society, ſince the laſt publication, equally large and unexpected, ariſing from two different ſources.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe was announced to the Directors in April laſt. For ſome time before, a correſpondence had been carried on between a reſpectable clergyman in the neighbouring part of the kingdom and the Secretary of the Society, reſpecting the nature of the inſtitution, the ſtate of the Society's funds, and the objects to which they are devoted. Inquiries on theſe points, it ſeems, were made at the requeſt of a gentleman, who then had it in view to become a benefactor to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but who wiſhed previouſly to ſatisfy himſelf as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0224400400:70"/>
to the proſpect of utility to the public from his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed donation. The information wanted, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately given, in the fulleſt and freeſt manner; and, as the Secretary was aſſured by his reverend correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to the entire ſatisfaction of the gentleman at whoſe deſire the correſpondence was carried on. The hopes of the members were in conſequence excited of a conſiderable donation; but their moſt ſanguine ideas were far exceeded by the munificent gift of which they ſoon after received the notice: For in a letter from the ſame clergyman, towards the end of March, a truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was tranſmitted to the Secretary, conveying to the Society the ſum of TEN THOUSAND POUNDS ſtock in the national fund of the five <hi>per cent.</hi> annuities. The ſtock was transferred to a moſt reſpectable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as truſtee, to receive the dividends on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's account for a few years, if they ſhould think it proper that the truſt ſhould continue ſo long; but with power to them to take the ſtock into their own management, in caſe they ſhould ſo incline. This dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo conſiderable and unexpected, was rendered ſtill more remarkable by the ſingular delicacy of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous donor's mind. While he took effectual meaſures that the benefit of his donation ſhould be enjoyed by the public, he diſcovered an equal and no leſs effectual anxiety, that the benefactor ſhould remain altogether unknown. The Society are therefore prevented from communicating perſonally to himſelf the ſentiments of gratitude and reſpect with which this princely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction has impreſſed their minds. Theſe however, they anxiouſly embraced the earlieſt opportunity of expreſſing to the clergyman through whoſe channel
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0224400400:71"/>
this correſpondence had been conducted, and to the gentleman who had been nominated, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to act as truſtee. By them the grateful impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Society were communicated to this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, though unknown, friend to religion and the country. As a ſmall teſtimony of their gratitude (the only one in their power), the Society unanimouſly reſolved, and immediately <hi>aſſumed as members</hi> both the gentleman who is appointed truſtee, and the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman above referred to.</p>
            <p>Soon after the intelligence of this large and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon donation had been given, the Society had the ſatisfaction to receive accounts of a ſecond acceſſion to their funds, ſtill more conſiderable than the former, by a legacy of the late <hi>Peter Huguetan, Lord Vanvry hovven of Holland.</hi> For ſome years, this Nobleman had been a regular and liberal benefactor to the inſtitution, at the anniverſary meetings of the Correſponding Board in London; and in 1789, the Society received from him a donation of five hundred pounds of the four <hi>per cent.</hi> Bank annuities, tranſferred to them by a deed of truſt. After his death, which happened in the courſe of this year, it appeared, that by his will, he had, amongſt a variety of other legacies to different charitable inſtitutions, to a very large amount, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the Society in Scotland for propagating Chriſtian Knowledge, the ſum of TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS, for the purpoſes of the firſt and ſecond pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; that is to ſay, for promoting religion, litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and induſtry in the Highlands and Iſlands. His Lordſhip's executors have found it neceſſary, before paying any of the legacies, to have the authority of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0224400400:72"/>
the Court of Chancery for their procedure. This may occaſion ſome little delay in the payment of the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but there is no doubt, that in a ſhort time the Society will be put in poſſeſſion of this great and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent bequeſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe two large additions to their funds, the Society likewiſe, with gratitude, have to acknowledge many leſſer benefactions, which it is unneceſſary to particulariſe: One only it may be proper to mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—a legacy of three hundred pounds, bequeathed by the late Mrs. Welſh of Edinburgh, which they lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>Theſe numerous and ſubſtantial proofs of the favour of the public to this inſtitution, the Society regard as a circumſtance no leſs honourable than pleaſing. To employ theſe large additions to their revenue, in the manner moſt conſonant to the views of the donors, and the beſt intereſts of religion and the country, is their duty, and ſhall be their conſtant endeavour.</p>
            <p>The anniverſary meeting of the Correſponding Board at London for this year, was no leſs ſucceſsful than on former occaſions. The ſermon was preached by the Reverend Mr. Rutledge, one of the members of the Church of Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſettled in London. Though the interference of an important debate in the Houſe of Commons on the day of meeting, prevented almoſt all the members of both Houſes of Parliament from being preſent; though their noble Preſes, the Earl of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noul (whoſe zeal for the Society's welfare they have on every occaſion experienced), was detained by bad health, and three of the ſtewards, by neceſſary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet upwards of one hundred and ſixty noblemen
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0224400400:73"/>
and gentlemen attended the meeting, the Earl of Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow being in the chair. The collection amounted to upwards of two hundred and ſixty pounds. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thanks of the Society are due to the Earl of Glaſgow, the Reverend Mr. Rutledge, the Reverend Dr. Hunter, the ſeveral noblemen and gentlemen who exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the office of ſtewards at the meeting, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Correſponding Board, for their ſervices on this, as well as on many former occaſions.</p>
            <p>The leaſe of the Society's eſtate of Calrouſt being near a cloſe, the Directors thought it their duty, in order to aſcertain the real value of this farm, to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe a new leaſe of it, publicly intimating, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, which upon the whole ſhould appear to be the beſt, ſhould be preferred. Propoſals were made by different candidates, offering conſiderable additions of rent: After conſidering which, a leaſe was lately entered into with the former tenant, at a rent more than double of what theſe lands had formerly yielded. A bargain which, however advantageous to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, they have reaſon to believe, will prove by no means oppreſſive to the tenant.</p>
            <p>The leaſe of the Society's eſtate of Catworth in Huntingdonſhire, expired at Whitſunday 1790. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore renewing it, the Directors procured an accurate report by a gentleman on the ſpot, of its ſtate and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: And ſoon afterwards, the Earl of Kinnoul, with his uſual attention to the intereſts of the Society, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the trouble of a minute inveſtigation of that report; by which it was confirmed in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: And his Lordſhip, in conſequence of powers from the Directors, concluded a new leaſe with the

former tenant, at a rent higher by twenty pounds than the former.</p>
            <p>The revenue ariſing from this laſt mentioned eſtate, together with that of ſome other branches of the Society's funds, are by the donors ſpecially appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the propagation of Chriſtian Knowledge in America, and other heathen and infidel countries. The Society have not been inattentive to the proper applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe funds. Two miſſionaries, as has been formerly mentioned to the public, are employed by them in America, viz. the Reverend Mr. Kirkland a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Oneida, Onondago, and Seneka Indians, and the Reverend Mr. Sargeant among the Stockbridge tribes. Of the ardent zeal and indefatigable exertions of the former, the Society have repeatedly had occaſion to report in the warmeſt terms of approbation. His laſt journals afford ſufficient evidence that his labours are continued with uniform earneſtneſs and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The labours of Mr. Sargeant, though in a narrower ſphere, appear to be faithful and aſſiduous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What ſucceſs may ultimately attend the exertions of the Society in theſe remote and unenlightened regions, it is not for the members to pronounce. That many individuals among the Savages have, by the bleſſing of God, become ſavingly acquainted with the truths of the Goſpel, and that the morals and external conduct of great numbers have been improved, they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to believe. One thing is acknowledged by all who have acceſs to be acquainted with theſe tribes, that thoſe of them among whom the light of the Goſpel has been in any meaſure diffuſed, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0224400400:75"/>
leſs addicted to exceſs in the uſe of ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, leſs cruel and ferocious in their manners, and more attentive to the arts of civilized life, particularly agriculture. Of late, propoſals have been laid before the Society for ſome farther extenſion of their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by eſtabliſhing ſchools in the Indian terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, for educating in the principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, literature, and civilization, the children of the Indians, particularly thoſe of the Sachems or chief men; and alſo for ſending a new miſſion into the remote, and hitherto almoſt unexplored country of the Cherokees. Thoſe propoſals appeared to them to merit attention: The firſt of them, for erecting ſome new ſchools for the education of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian youth, they have already taken meaſures for adopting; the other is a matter of ſuch difficulty, and attended with ſuch expence, that far more information muſt be obtained, as to the method of carrying it into execution, and its probable ſucceſs, before the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will think themſelves vindicated in making the attempt. A plan formerly under conſideration, for conveying the knowledge of the Goſpel to Africa, by means of ſome emancipated and converted negroes of Rhode Iſland, has again been renewed; and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors have written to the reſpectable clergyman with whom the propoſal originated, for ſuch information as may enable them to judge of its practicability.</p>
            <p>The concluding part of the tranſlation of the Gaelic Bible is now in the preſs, and part of it printed off. From the nature of the work, and the uncommon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention it requires, the progreſs is neceſſarily ſlow; but the public may reſt aſſured, that no care ſhall be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0224400400:76"/>
wanting, to carry it on with as little delay as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will allow.</p>
            <p>In the Apendix to laſt anniverſary ſermon, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors ſtated their proceedings in regard to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will of the late pious Lady Glenorchy, and the funds deſtined for the improvement of the eſtates of Breadalbane and Sutherland. To what is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed in relation to the firſt of theſe eſtates, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors have nothing to add, but that the continuance of the co-operation and encouragement of the noble proprietor and his men of buſineſs, gives the pleaſing proſpect of much ſatisfaction to the Society, as well as benefit to the country, from this well-directed legacy. In regard to that part of it, intended for the eſtate of Sutherland, it was then mentioned that a plan for the diſpoſal of it had been formed, after much enquiry and correſpondence on the ſubject, and tranſmitted to the noble proprietors for their conſent and co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſtipulations required by the Society were ſo moderate, and ſo ſimilar to thoſe chearfully agreed to by many other proprietors in the Highlands, that the Directors would not allow themſelves to doubt of a ready compliance on the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part of thoſe of the eſtate of Sutherland. It is with deep regret that they find themſelves obliged to acknowledge that their hopes had been too ſanguine. The Directors are unwilling to enter into a detail of the correſpondence which took place between the noble proprietors and them on the ſubject. Suffice it to ſay, that upon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after repeated endeavours, that they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for the teachers, male and female, whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to appoint in that country, the accommodations
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0224400400:77"/>
neceſſary, and uſually granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were reluctantly compelled to take advantage of that clauſe in Lady Glenorchy's will, by which, in caſe of a refuſal of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation upon the part of the proprietors of either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, the Directors ſhould be at liberty to beſtow the money in any part of the Highlands or iſlands where they ſhould think proper. It is but juſtice however, to Earl Gower to ſtate, that altho' he did not chooſe to agree to the terms of the Directors, they were aſſured by his deſire, that he had given orders to his agent to allow annually for charitable purpoſes upon the eſtate, a ſum equal to that, which, from the preſent ſtate of the fund, would have ariſen from Lady Glenorchy's legacy. The Directors have only to add, upon this ſubject, which of all their communications to the public concerning their proceedings is the leaſt gratifying to their own feelings, that upon receiving the laſt anſwer from the noble proprietors, which precluded all hopes of a ſpeedy renewal of the correſpondence with any proſpect of ſucceſs, they came to the following reſolution; with which they ſhall leave the ſubject, and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to the deciſion of an impartial public. <q>The Directors having read, and maturely conſidered, the whole of the correſpondence which has taken place between the Counteſs of Sutherland, in name of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Lord Gower, upon the one part, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Society, under the ſanction of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the committee on the other: Find, That, the proprietors of the eſtate of Sutherland, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to co-operate with the Directors in their plan for the improvement of the inhabitants of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in religion and induſtry: And that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0224400400:78"/>
the Directors are, by the terms of Lady Glenorchy's will, prevented from laying out the money which ſhe intended for that eſtate, in the manner which appeared to them beſt adapted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the object, which the pious teſtatrix had in view: That they are therefore at liberty to beſtow that money in promoting the general objects of the Society in any part of the Highlands and iſlands, where it ſhall appear to them to be neceſſary. At the ſame time, the Directors, deeply ſenſible of the neceſſity which the eſtate of Sutherland labours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the means of inſtruction, both with reſpect to literature and induſtry, and feeling ſincere compaſſion for the people, RESOLVE, That whenever any appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhall be made from any part of that country for aid from the funds of the Society, and proper ſecurity given for the fulfilment of the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by its fundamental rules, they will gladly liſten to ſuch application.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It only remains, that in this abſtract of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings ſince the laſt publication, the Directors ſhould ſtate the progreſs of the Secretary in the execution of the commiſſion granted him in the year 1789; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular objects of which were recited in the Appendix of that year.</p>
            <p>Having employed the greateſt part of two Summers preceding, in viſiting very different and extenſive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts of the Highlands and iſlands, the Secretary flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf, that he ſhould have been able, during the courſe of this laſt, to have fulfilled all that he originally propoſed in the diſcharge of his commiſſion. And had his attention been conſined to the mere <hi>viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the ſchools already upon the eſtabliſhment of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0224400400:79"/>
Society, it is probable that he might have accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this object. But in conſequence of the late very great acceſſion to their funds, which has been already ſtated, the Society were led to enlarge their ideas and their plans to a ſcale correſponding with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended capacities of uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>The remote weſtern Highlands and iſlands, of all the countries of Scotland, were the leaſt known to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and, of all thoſe to which their attention is called by their patents, had leaſt experienced the benefit of their inſtitution. It was reſolved that the Secretary ſhould vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit theſe diſtant and widely extended diſtricts, enquire into the ſtate of religion, literature, and induſtry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their inhabitants, and report to the Society ſuch plans as ſhould appear moſt likely to promote their improvement. A general outline of a tour for this purpoſe was agreed upon by the Directors in concert with the Secretary; and he was inſtructed to begin his journey as ſoon after the anniverſary meeting in June as poſſible.</p>
            <p>On account of the extent, variety, and difficulty of the navigation which this tour involved, it was judged abſolutely neceſſary that a veſſel ſhould be provided or obtained to attend him, during the courſe of it. To have hired one of a competent ſize, would have been attended with great expence: beſides that, ſcarcely any one could have been got for hire ſo well adapted to the purpoſe, as one of the revenue cutters in the ſervice of Government.</p>
            <p>From the well known liberality of the Board of Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, in promoting all objects of public utility, and from the private information of one of its reſpectable members, the Society were led to hope, that an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0224400400:80"/>
to them for one of the yachts under their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate direction, would not fail of ſucceſs. The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent having accordingly applied in name of the Society to the Board, a moſt polite anſwer was received; and the <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> brig, commanded by Captain John Campbell, was ordered to be in readineſs at Oban by the 15th of June, to take on board the Secretary, and proceed with him during the whole of his tour. And here the Directors think it nothing more than juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to mention, that in this veſſel the Secretary ſound moſt excellent accomodation; a careful obliging com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, ſober, attentive, and diligent officers and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: of all of whom, every one was more ready than another to oblige him, and to forward the objects of his miſſion.</p>
            <p>The Secretary having ſet out from Edinburgh in the middle of June, proceeded by the way of Glaſgow, Dumbarton, and Inverary, to Oban; viſiting ſuch of the Society's ſchools as lay immediately on his road, but not diverted by any that lay remote from it, from the great objects of this Summer's tour, viz. the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant weſtern coaſts and remoter iſlands of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides.</p>
            <p>Having gone aboard the yacht at Oban, he proceeded through the ſound of Mull to Tobermory, one of the newly eſtabliſhed villages of the Britiſh Society, where their operations are going on with ſpirit, and already make a reſpectable appearance; viſited the weſtern parts of the iſland of Mull, where he had not been during the courſe of his former tour; ſailed up Loch Sunart, an arm of the ſea, ſtretching 35 miles into the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on the oppoſite coaſt, to Strontian, a ſtation where
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0224400400:81"/>
the Society have long had a ſchool eſtabliſhed; went round the point of Ardnamurchan, a promontory ſtretching far into the weſtern ocean, beat by an almoſt continually turbulent ſea; and ſailed along the coaſts of Moydart, Ariſaig, and Morer, inhabited chiefly by Roman Catholics, though now, in conſequence of the progreſs of ſheep-farming, their numbers are greatly diminiſhed by emigration.</p>
            <p>On this extenſive coaſt the Society have only one ſchool eſtabliſhed, and even that is in a languiſhing ſtate. He proceeded to the iſland of Egg, the chief of four ſmall iſles, of which the pariſh of that name conſiſts; and, accompanied by the miniſter, ſailed to a harbour in Slate, the ſouthermoſt pariſh of the vaſt iſland of Sky; having traverſed a conſiderable part of that pariſh, he croſſed over to the coaſt of <hi>Knoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart,</hi> and viſited a ſchool of the Society there: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Glenelg,</hi> where he had the pleaſure to meet the ſynod of the bounds, though, on account of the ſingular violence and long continuance of a ſtorm at the time, few, comparatively, of the clergy had been able to aſſemble. From them who did meet in the ſynod, both collectively and individually, he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced much attention, and received much information. From Glenelg, accompanied by ſome of the miniſters, the Secretary travelled, ſometimes by water, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on horſeback or on foot, through the pariſhes of Kintail, Lochalſh, Lochcarron, and Applecroſs. From thence to the iſlands of Scalpa and Raaſa;—back to Sky; traverſed Diurniſh, Braccadale, Snizort, Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muir and Portree, extenſive pariſhes in that great iſland;—a part of his tour which, from the badneſs of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0224400400:82"/>
the greater part of the roads, and the almoſt inceſſant rain of that watery climate, was attended with no ſmall fatigue.</p>
            <p>From Sky he ſailed to Lochbroom; viſited ſeveral ſchools of the Society in that country; and among the reſt, one eſtabliſhed at Ullapool, the firſt and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſettlement of the Britiſh Society; and where, in conſequence of the requeſt of that Society, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors have eſtabliſhed a ſchool-maſter, who is at the ſame time an ordained miniſter, and officiates every Sunday to a numerous congregation, by whom his uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is felt and acknowledged.</p>
            <p>From Ullapool the Secretary ſailed to Stornoway, a populous and thriving village in the iſland of Lewis, the property of Humberſton M'Kenzie of Seaforth, Eſq. There, in concert with the proprietor, (who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a moſt laudable zeal for the object), the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the four extenſive pariſhes into which this great iſland is divided, together with ſome intelligent and reſpectable people of Stornoway, ſome plans were deviſed for promoting the much needed improvement of the inhabitants, in religion, literature, and induſtry, and put into a fair train for being carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>From Stornoway he ſailed by the coaſt of Harris, to North Uiſt, and, accompanied by the miniſters of Harris, North Uiſt, and Barra, travelled on horſeback through North Uiſt, and over the ſtrands at low water, to Benbicula and South Uiſt; croſſed over to Barra; ſailed to the iſlands of Cana, Rum, Col, Tiree; and returning by the Sound of Mull, and paſſing the iſlands adjoining to the coaſt of Argyleſhire, which he had
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0224400400:83"/>
viſited on a former tour, went to thoſe of Jura and Iſla; in the laſt mentioned of which, the exertions and ſucceſs of that indefatigable and ſagacious improver, Mr. Campbell of Shawfield, affected his mind with equal pleaſure and ſurpriſe. From Iſla he ſailed round the Mull of Kintyre to Campbelton, and returned by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran and Bute to Greenock and Glaſgow, after an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of three months and ſome days.</p>
            <p>During the courſe of this various and extenſive tour, the Secretary experienced every where from the gentlemen and clergy the greateſt perſonal attention, and that hoſpitality for which they have been always and juſtly celebrated. Among thoſe whom, on this account, he mentioned with reſpect and gratitude in his journal, are Sir James Riddel of Ardnamurchan and Sunart, Bart., Mr. M`Kenzie of Applecroſs, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel M`Leod of M`Leod, Mr. M`Kenzie of Seaforth, Mr. M`Donald of Boiſdale, Mr. M`Lean of Col, and Mr. Campbell of Shawfield, Mr. Maxwell, factor for the Duke of Argyll in Mull, Mr. Campbell, his Grace's chamberlain in the iſland of Tirii, and Mr. M`Donald of Liondale in Sky. To all his brethren of the clergy without exception, with whom he had acceſs to meet, he acknowledged his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their attention and civilities: The perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and fatigue to which they ſubmitted in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding his progreſs, and the objects of his miſſion, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a particular tribute of thanks due to Mr. M`Iver of Glenelg; Mr. M`Queen of Applecroſs; Mr. M`Leod of Harris; and Mr Edmund M`Queen of North Uiſt. Nor was he unmindful of what he owed to ſome of the clergy of the Roman Catholic perſuaſion for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal civilities, and what he ſtill more highly valued,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0224400400:84"/>
the liberality of ſpirit, and zeal with which they entered into, and forwarded the objects of his miſſion, paricularly by exhorting and uſing their influence with their people to ſend their children to the ſchools of the Society, to be inſtructed in literature, and in thoſe great principles of religion in which all ſects among Chriſtians are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited. It was a ſight, he is perſuaded, not common—a Proteſtant miniſter, commiſſioned by the Society for propogating Chriſtian Knowledge, attended in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs by Roman Catholic prieſts, and they zealouſly joining with him in common efforts, to promote the reading of the ſcriptures, among the youth of their own community. For his introduction to them, and their favourable impreſſions of his views, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his obligations to the candid and fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of a worthy and reſpectable perſon among the ſuperior order of the clergy of that perſuaſion in Scotland.—Names, in this part of the detail, prudence ſuggeſts, it may be proper to omit.</p>
            <p>To ſeveral of the above named great proprietors, the Secretary was indebted, not merely for hoſpitality and perſonal attentions, but for the zeal with which they entered into the views and the liberality which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed in promoting the objects of his miſſion, on their extenſive eſtates. Among theſe, Seaforth, M`Leod, and Shawfield, are to be numbered with particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. The Duke of Argyll, though his want of health at the time, deprived the Secretary of the honour of waiting upon him in perſon; yet, with the wonted, and well known benevolence of his character, furniſhed his men of buſineſs with the ampleſt inſtructions to promote the objects of the Secretary's commiſſion, in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0224400400:85"/>
the different parts of his immenſe eſtate;—inſtructions, with which, in the ſpirit that dictated them, they are ſtudying to comply.</p>
            <p>The Secretary's journal concludes with the following general obſervations, and propoſitions, which were read firſt to the Directors, and then to a general meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Society; the Directors judged it expedient to lay them alſo before the public at large.</p>
            <p>"Thus, the Secretary has endeavoured to fulfil the objects of the commiſſion given to him by the Society in the tour marked out for him for the preſent ſeaſon. It is by far the moſt extenſive, and in a variety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the moſt intereſting, which he has ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in their ſervice. Having kept a regular journal of his proceedings, he thinks it his duty to offer it as it is, in its ſimple unornamented form, to the candid attention of his conſtituents <note n="*" place="bottom">Being too long to be read to a meeting, it was handed round among the members individually.</note>. It preſents a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly picture of a vaſt extent of country, and of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of a great multitude of our fellow citizens. He put down, with fidelity, upon the ſpot, whatever occurred to him to be neceſſary to exhibit their real circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the painful reſult of the whole is, that pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ignorance, and idleneſs, or rather the want of proper and profitable induſtry, generally obtain in the remoter weſtern coaſts and iſlands; in ſome extenſive diſtricts, he is ſorry to be obliged to add, neglect, and even op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. To attempt to remedy prevailing diſorders, and to afford ſome ſupply to the defects by which they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0224400400:86"/>
are in great meaſure occaſioned, is the unqueſtionable duty of the Society.</p>
            <p>After peruſing the report which he has given in, the members, he is perſuaded, will join with the ſecretary, in grateful acknowledgments to a kind Providence, which by the late wonderful acceſſion to their funds, has enabled them ſo far to enlarge their ſcheme, as to embrace within its benevolent compaſs, many parts of the ancient kingdom of Scotland hitherto in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure neglected. The Secretary has ſtated, as he went along, the objects in theſe parts which moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately claim the attention of the Society: the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments for religion, literature, and induſtry, which appear to be chiefly wanted: the encouragements which they may expect to meet with, and the obſtacles which may oppoſe their beneficent exertions.</p>
            <p>The Secretary begs leave to ſuggeſt, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to his long narrative, a few general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which appear to be of importance; and then to offer ſome hints towards a plan for the diſburſement of the Society's additional funds.</p>
            <p>At firſt ſight, one is apt to imagine, that nothing can be more eaſy, as nothing to a benevolent mind is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, as the diſtribution of money for charitable purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. A narrower inſpection, however, ſoon convinces every perſon of underſtanding, that to ſelect the proper objects, and to beſtow in ſuch a manner as not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct but to forward the general progreſs and welfare of Society, is a difficult taſk, requiring much inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the exerciſe of a ſound and vigorous mind.</p>
            <p>In the preſent caſe, many obſtacles to the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſigns of the Society ariſe from the remoteneſs of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0224400400:87"/>
the countries to which they extend, and the peculiar circumſtances in which they are placed: Of theſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, none can form a ſufficiently diſtinct or impreſſive idea, who has not viſited them, and had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of becoming perſonally acquainted with the ſituations and characters, habits and prejudices, of the different claſſes of the inhabitants. Such is the poverty of the great body of them, ſuch their deficiency of the means of religion, literature, and induſtry, that the additional funds of the ſociety, ample as they have now become, are by no means equal to the ſupply of their wants. Some diſcrimination, therefore, is neceſſary. Some general rules and fixed principles muſt be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adhered to, elſe diſorder, neglect of ſome moſt deſtitute ſituations, and general complaints of partiality and favouritiſm againſt the Directors, muſt enſue.</p>
            <p>The FIRST principle, therefore, which ought in all caſes to be acted upon, is, <hi>that without co-operation and ſupport from ſome having immediate intereſt, the Society ought never to beſtow their funds in promoting any objects whatever in theſe countries.</hi> But the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claſs of men from whom they can expect effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual co-operation, are either the proprietors of eſtates, or ſubſtantial tackſmen, who can give the ſecurity of long leaſes for the performance of their covenants.</p>
            <p>The body of the people are ſo poor and diſpirited, and hold their poſſeſſions by ſo inſecure a tenure, that upon them no dependence can be placed.</p>
            <p>The experience of the Society for many years, too amply vindicates this aſſertion. In a multitude of inſtances which have fallen under the obſervation of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0224400400:88"/>
the Secretary, where the moſt liberal promiſes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation to their teachers were given, ſcarcely any of them have been fulfilled. The teachers have been forced, out of their ſmall ſalaries, to pay for the eſſential articles, which, by the rules of the Society and the engagements of the people, ſhould have been furniſhed to them gratis. The conſequences are, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme indigence, depreſſion of ſpirits, negligence of duty, and contempt.</p>
            <p>Let no urgency of intreaty, therefore, and no cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy of ſituation ever induce the Directors to depart from their eſtabliſhed rules upon this point; and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the fulfilment of engagements, <hi>let no teacher ever be ſent to a ſtation till the articles conditioned for are actually provided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This principle may ſeem harſh: It may be ſaid, that where the people are too poor to be able, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors unwilling to furniſh the accommodations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, it is hard that the people ſhould ſuffer—that they are only objects of the greater commiſeration. It is confeſſed that it is hard, and in many caſes a matter of juſt and deep regret. But, as has been mentioned, general rules <hi>muſt</hi> be adhered to, elſe unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion muſt enſue; and beſides, it is certain, that however averſe ſome proprietors may be to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for cultivating the minds and morals of their people; yet, <hi>as many</hi> will be found willing, as will exhauſt the funds which the Society can afford, or are entitled by the will of the donors to beſtow, upon theſe objects: <hi>and if people who eſſentially require it,</hi> are inſtructed, it matters not to the Society whether it be in this, or that corner of the country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0224400400:89"/>
ANOTHER principle which the Society will do well to attend to, <hi>is, to guard againſt a too liberal diſtribution of their funds in the firſt inſtance.</hi> By this obſervation, it is not meant to inſinuate that they ſhould reſtrain a liberal ſpirit. Good men have amply endued the Society; and the only return which they can make, is to devote their gifts to the great and important ends for which they were beſtowed. It is ſuggeſted only that they ſhould be careful to avoid anticipating by a premature application, funds which they may hereafter ſee cauſe to apply to ſtill more important and beneficial purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The late ſurpriſing increaſe of the Society's ſtock has been publiſhed every where, and excited a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in the Highlands and Iſlands to profit by it. Many applications have been made in conſequence, and many more may be expected. Among theſe, let the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, after a careful and mature inveſtigation, ſelect thoſe which ſhall appear moſt likely to prove immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately beneficial to the country. Let them be on their guard againſt plauſible repreſentations and general and fair promiſes. Promiſes are eaſily made, and where the acquiſition of money is the object, the inhabitants of a poor country are generally profuſe of them; but the Society may learn, from paſt experience, to take every poſſible precaution in order to ſecure perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. By this plan of proceeding, they may, and probably will, give offence to, and bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the reproaches of intereſted individuals; but they will thus moſt effectually guard againſt jobbing, and beſt promote the general intereſt of the country.</p>

The Secretary, though he preſumes to throw out this general hint with reſpect to caution in the deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their new funds, yet takes the liberty to ſay to the Directors, and to the Society, that upon peruſing his report, he hopes the members will find no cauſe to accuſe him of a narrow or illiberal ſpirit in conducting his tour. Though he ever made it his endeavour to avoid unneceſſary expence; yet he conſidered himſelf as the confidential ſervant and repreſentative of a great and reſpectable community, furniſhed with ample funds for promoting public and important objects. He travelled in countries where the fruits of the Society's bounty had been hitherto but ſparingly ſcattered; and the nature of the inſtitution, and the character of its members but imperfectly known. It behoved him therefore to act, not as his own humble ſphere, and narrow funds would have dictated, but in the ſpirit of that character with which he was inveſted. In every caſe he ſtudied to act as it occurred to him his conſtituents would have wiſhed him to do. If, after receiving <hi>certain</hi>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0224400400:91"/>
the diſcretionary powers with which they inveſted him.</p>
            <p>Having ſtated theſe few general obſervations, the Secretary begs leave to ſubjoin the following? opoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards the formation of a plan for the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the newly acquired, and great acceſſion to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's ſtock.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The neceſſity of this meaſure is particularly urgent in many of the weſtern coaſts and iſlands, where the extreme poverty of the inhabitants renders them unable, and their own ignorance averſe, to beſtow even a trifle for the education of their children. In many inſtances, during his laſt tour, the Secretary, in order to induce parents to ſend their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſchool, was obliged to promiſe them a total exemption from fees of every ſort, beſides furniſhing them with books.</p>
                  <p>In theſe countries the price of meal is always higher than upon the eaſt coaſt, and in the low countries of Scotland. This laſt Summer it was on an average, at leaſt 18 s. <hi>per</hi> boll. The difficulty of tranſporting it to the interior parts of countries where there are no roads, greatly enhances the price to ſchoolmaſters, who have no ſervants or horſes of their own. The Secretary ſound ſome who had paid no leſs than 25 s. <hi>per</hi> boll for it, when laid down at their houſes. In not a few caſes during the courſe of laſt Summer, they could not, for weeks together, obtain it at any price. It may appear incredible, but is nevertheleſs an undoubted fact, that in the months of June and July laſt, there was not an ounce of meal to be obtained for money by the people of ſome extenſive diſtricts and iſlands—their potatoes were exhauſted, and they were reduced to the neceſſity of living wholly on ſiſh and milk. Cockles and other ſhell-fiſh were often their chief ſupport. How much, in ſuch circumſtances, is a man to be pitied who has to maintain himſelf and a family upon a ſalary of 10 l. or 12 l.?</p>
                  <p>Parochial ſchoolmaſters in theſe countries are in very little better condition than thoſe of the ſociety. The <hi>maximum</hi> of the legal ſalary, together with the trifling addition of their fees as ſeſſion clerks, and what they receive from the few who can afford to pay for education to their children, make altogether but a miſerable proviſion for a man of <hi>ſome</hi> education and literature, with a family. In a variety of caſes, they are reſtricted to the <hi>minimum,</hi> or 5 l. 11. s. 1 d. 4-12ths. The conſequence is, that men of merit cannot be found to ſupply theſe ſtations, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in them; and in fact, many of them are vacant. In ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ſalaries of two, in ſome of three or four pariſhes, are united to conſtitute a decent proviſion for one ſchoolmaſter for them all. How much is it to be regretted, that the gentlemen of landed property in Scotland ſhould have been induced to oppoſe the moderate and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able claims for an augmentation of ſalary, to theſe moſt uſeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſervants of the public, and eſpecially of thoſe in theſe remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where no talents, no induſtry, and no ſucceſs in teaching can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly better th eir livings.?</p>
               </note> is, That <hi>the ſalaries of the ſchoolmaſters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their eſtabliſhment be augmented.</hi> The fall of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money, ſince many of theſe ſalaries were firſt granted, and the conſequent riſe in the price of all the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0224400400:92"/>
neceſſaries of life renders this a meaſure of indiſpenſible neceſſity, if the Directors wiſh to ſee the teachers on their eſtabliſhment relieved from abſolute poverty, and placed upon a reſpectable and uſeful footing. But this aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation ought not to extend indiſcriminately to <hi>all</hi> the teachers. Some have already ſalaries fully adequate both to their merits and to their neceſſities, while others, and they moſt deſerving ſervants of the public, are in poor and diſtreſſed circumſtances. Let the augmentation be conducted with a ſtrict regard to the circumſtances of each particular caſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, <hi>The printing of a new edition of the Gaelic Bible</hi> in a more convenient and cheaper form than the preſent, which conſiſts of four octavo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and is conſequently too bulky to anſwer the purpoſes of thoſe for whom it is chiefly intended. When the volume of the Old Teſtament ſcriptures now in the preſs, ſhall be completed, the whole impreſſion (according to the plan formerly agreed upon for diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) will be ſpeedily exhauſted—a new edition will then become abſolutely neceſſary, and is certainly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0224400400:93"/>
a debt which the Society owes to the public, as well as to the great and ſundamental objects of their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Meantime the impreſſion of the Gaelic New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being now almoſt wholly diſtributed, a new edition of that part of the ſcriptures alone, correſponding to the form and type of the future intended edition of the Old, becomes neceſſary; and this, it is imagined, the Directors will ſee cauſe to give orders for ſetting about without delay.</p>

In the report of the Secretary, many different ſtations in the Weſtern Highlands and iſlands are ſpecified where ſuch ſchools are moſt eſſentially wanted, and where the proprietors are willing to give the neceſſary accommodations. A ſcheme for theſe much needed eſtabliſhments, it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be digeſted with all poſſible care by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, when the proper time ſhall arrive, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the directors for their approbation. Whether among theſe, a few ſchools upon a higher ſcale, and calculated for teaching branches of education of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior claſs to thoſe of the ordinary run of the Society's eſtabliſhment (navigation, for example, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mathematics among ſea-faring people), may not be proper, is a ſubject well deſerving the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar attention of the directors at a ſubſequent period.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>A variety of cauſes have contributed to produce that rage for emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration to America, which now obtains, in many parts of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands and Iſlands. Among theſe are to be numbered, it is true, the cauſes commonly aſſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſpeopling, in great meaſure, of large tracts of country in order to make room for ſheep;—the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſmall into great farms, to the excluſion of the inferior order of tenants:—the prejudice, almoſt invincible, which many Highland pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p ietors entertain againſt granting any leaſes, or leaſes of a ſufficient length to encourage the tenants to improve their farms;—the eagerneſs with which ſome landholders raiſe their rents, while they furniſh nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>means</hi> nor inſtruction as to the <hi>manner</hi> by which the tenants may be enabled to pay them; the non-reſidence of the proprietors, and their total want of tenderneſs for, or attention to their people, in conſequence of which the ancient confidence and affection ſubſiſting between Chiefs and their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>clans are <hi>greatly</hi> weakened, in ſome parts of the country, <hi>totally</hi> annihilated. Add to theſe, the claims of affection and kindred, vehemently urged, by thoſe who have already emigrated, on their friends and neighbours at home, to induce them to follow their example; and the flattering, perhaps inſidious, repreſentations of agents, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by purchaſers of land in America to engage ſettlers to remove to their eſtates—add likewiſe, the contagion of example, and the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit of wandering, which often, without reaſon from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſſure of grievances felt, ſeizes upon a body of people; and you have a liſt of the commonly aſſigned, and in part true cauſes of emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At the ſame time, an attentive and general obſervation of the preſent ſtate of the Highlands and Iſlands, it is imagined, will fully warrant the aſſertion, that the great and moſt univerſally operating cauſe of emigration, is, <hi>that in compariſon of the means of ſubſiſtence which they afford, theſe countries are greatly over-ſtocked with inhabitants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inteſtine wars and feuds, by which numbers of them in former ages were cut off, have for many years been unknown. No drains for the ſupply of the army and navy have of late been made. Add to this, that the people are prolific to an uncommon degree. Want and miſery ſtaring them in the face, prevent not, among theſe ſimple uncorrupted people, the early marriage of both ſexes; and the children ſeldom ſail to be numerous.</p>
                  <p>The climate in theſe countries is generally unfriendly to the growth of corn. Rains prevail through a great part of the year; ſeed-time and harveſt are late, and the ſcanty crop is with difficulty got in, ſeldom without injury from the weather. Oats and barlcy, or rather bear, both of an inferior kind, are almoſt the only ſpecies of grain raiſed in theſe countries. Oats, at an average, yield only about three, and bear about ſix returns. The expence of raiſing even theſe poor crops, in compariſon of their value, is immenſe. From theſe various cauſes, many moſt intelligent obſervers of the ſtate of theſe countries are of opinion, that the raiſing of corn ought ſeldom comparatively to be attempted in the Weſtern Highlands and Iſlands, and that the attention of farmers ought to be confined to the improvement of their paſture lands, and the cultivation of potatoes, and other green crops.—Were the odious and unproductive tax upon coal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The coarſe cloths uſed for home conſumption, both linen and woollen, are ſpun by the women on the <hi>diſtaff,</hi> chiefly while engaged in attending the cattle, or in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the field, a great part of the drudgery of which is performed by <hi>them,</hi> while the men are either idle, or engaged in fiſhing. Women carry ſea weed to the kelp kilns, and manure to the fields, on their backs; and in many reſpects are uſed as leaſes of burden. To almoſt all the arts of female induſtry within doors they are ſtrangers; ſo that the greateſt part of the winter months they ſpend in abſolute idleneſs, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, along with the reſt of the families to which they belong, upon two meals of the coarſeſt fare in the 24 hours; and happy would the bulk of the people in theſe countries deem themſelves, if even of ſuch fare they had twice in the day what would ſatisfy the demands of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The introduction of manufactures into theſe countries of all expedients is the beſt adapted for their improvement. This is a propoſition too ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vious to require proof or illuſtration. Difficulties, as may naturally be ſuppoſed, muſt attend the accompliſhment of this object; but were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors to pay that attention to it which its importance to their own intereſt, as well as the happineſs of their people, demand, it is imagined that theſe difficulties would ſoon be ſound not only not unſurmountable, but eaſy to be overcome.</p>
                  <p>Among the cauſes which contributed to prevent the ſucceſs of former attempts for the introduction of manufactures into the Highlands, may be reckoned the very great expence in buildings, ſalaries to agents, factors, &amp;c. with which they were conducted, and their aiming at too high objects at the outſet.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the ſimpleſt principles; to make the people employed feel the immediate and <hi>full</hi> benefit of their own induſtry; and to proceed gradually, ſuffering the manufacture to ſupport itſelf, or nearly ſo, in its various progreſſive ſtages, ſeems to be the moſt probable, as it ſurely is the leaſt hazardous mode of enſuring ſucceſs.</p>

Different opinions are entertaines as to which of them the preference is due. The argument in ſavour of <hi>wool.</hi> the raw material being the produce of the country, is unqueſtionably ſtrong. But if inelination, convenience, or intereſt, ſhould lead to a preference of any of the reſt, why ſhould not the experiment be made?

It will rather excite an emulation favourable to all. Habits of application and induſtry, when once formed, may eaſily be directed into that channel which experience ſhall teach to be moſt advantageous.</p>
                  <p>Indolence is commonly conſidered as the moſt predominant feature in the character of the Highlanders—nothing can he a greater miſtake—no people are more quick-ſighted in diſcerning their own intereſt, when placed within the ſphere of their obſervation, or more patient and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in its purſuit. If, indeed, when but half fed and half clothed, their ſpirit broken by oppreſſion, and they forced to labour not for themſelves or their families, but for others, their exertions are but feeble, it is not to be wondered. But whenever the Highlanders enjoy the common advantages which free Britons do in other parts of the kingdom, experience and obſervation warrant the aſſertion, that they are excelled by none in quickneſs of apprehenſion or alertneſs of execution. Their ſpirit and activity in the army and navy are well known, and have been the ſubject of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p>How much then will it be a ſubject of regret, if a body of people poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing ſuch natural capacities of uſefulneſs, ſhall, in conſequence of the ſpirit of emigration to America, which now prevails, be for ever loſt to their own country!

                  <p>The want of a ſufficient number of eſtabliſhed clergy for conducting the offices of religion, is well known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has long been complained of, as one of the greateſt grievances which theſe countries labour under.</p>
                  <p>The report of Doctors Dick, Hyndman, &amp;c. app inted by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly 1760 to viſit the Highlands and Iſlands is, on this point, equally juſt and happily expreſſed. <q>Many pariſhes in theſe countries, eſpecially in the Weſtern Highlands and Iſlands, are ſo extenſive as to render the charge of them utterly diſproportioned to the ability of the moſt active miniſters. Several of them reſemble rather a province requiring the labours of a body of clergy, than a diſtrict fit for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of a ſingle paſtor. When to the extent of theſe pariſhes we add the difficulty of communication between the ſeveral parts of them, from the rivers, lakes, and huge mountains, which interſect the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern continent, and from the dangerous ſeas which ſeparate theſe iſlands, it is eaſy to conceive, that during a great part of the year many of the inhabitants muſt be deprived of all correſpondence with their paſtors, and deſtitute of all public means of inſtruction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this repreſentation, thoſe of Doctor Walker in 1765, and in 1772, perfectly accord; and that theſe countries, in this reſpect, ſtill remain in the ſame melancholy ſituation, the Secretary of the Socie y had too abundant evidence, during the courſe of his laſt tour.</p>
                  <p>The committee of the General Aſſembly annually appointed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Royal bounty, (a donation of 1000 l. given every year by the King to the Aſſembly, for the reformation of the Highlands and Iſlands) have done what in them lay for the redreſs of this evil, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of itinerant miniſters, beſides a number of catechiſts. Of the former, twenty-three are at preſent upon their eſtabliſhment, in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the Highlands and Iſlands. Their ſalaries ſomewhat vary, but do not, at a medium, exceed 30 l. Small as this appointment is, it is as much as the limited fund of the committee enables them to give. And when it is conſidered that the far greater number of miſſionaries appointed by them have no dwelling-houſes, and no accommodations of any ſort, ſave what they pay for out of this ſmall allowance, it is not to be wondered, that the majority of them, diſſatisfied with their ſituation, ſhould look out with anxiety for better ſettlements, or that their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and efforts ſhould ever be directed to this object.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible in the nature of things, that men ſo ſituated can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the reſpect, or diſcharge the duties of the paſtoral office with the authority of miniſters conſidered as connected with their people by the tie of comfortable accommodations, and an adequate income. Add to this, that few of them <hi>comparatively,</hi> have churches, or even decent houſes adapted to the purpoſe, for conducting the worſhip of God. Moſt of them ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e different ſtations, often at a great diſtance from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they are bound to officiate. At theſe places the people of the diſtricts convene on the previouſly appointed Lord's day; when the weather is tolerably favourable, they aſſemble on the ſide of a hill, or ſome where in the open air, and when it is otherwiſe, in ſome barn or houſe, the fitteſt for the purpoſe which they can find in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. In ſuch circumſtances, the poor miſſionary, after travelling on foot through muirs and moſſes, climbing hills, and wading rivers, is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to preſide in public worſhip, and when the fatigues of the day are over, has perhaps the ſame, or a ſimilar journey to perform, before he can obtain lodging or refreſhment.</p>
                  <p>When theſe facts are conſidered, (and they who are acquainted with the countries referred to, know that this is no exaggerated deſcription), the Directors of the Society will not ſurely be blamed, if, as a prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary condition to the eſtabliſhment of every miſſion upon their funds, they ſhall inſiſt upon having the accommodations above mentioned fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to the miniſter. They are in themſelves moſt reaſonable; they are eſſential to the comfort and reſpectability of men in their office, as well as to decency and propriety in the conduct of public worſhip. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in theſe, and in the ſalary propoſed, the miniſters will not regard <hi>their miſſions</hi> as mere temporary appointments, but as ſettlements in which they can live in comfort and independence; their people will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, (if they approve themſelves worthy of it) with the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to fixed paſtors, and attend upon the religious ordinances which they adminiſter with comfort and edification.</p>
                  <p>The accommodations above propoſed, it is evident, cannot be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>people; Proprietors</hi> alone are able to furniſh them. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary was ſorry to find ſome gentlemen of extenſive landed property in diſtricts where eſtabliſhments of this kind are peculiarly wanted, averſe to agree to theſe conditions; they were unwilling to be at the expence of the <hi>buildings,</hi> and their minds ſeemed to revolt at the idea of reſigning the ſmall portion of land above ſpecified, for any purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to <hi>expence</hi> of <hi>plain</hi> houſes, (and plain houſes alone, if comfortable, and adapted to their ſeveral purpoſes, will be required) it cannot be great, as the tenants will, without doubt, cheerfully furniſh the carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and <hi>that proprietor</hi> muſt have a limited income indeed, by whom it would be felt oppreſſive. And as to the ſo much dreaded alienation of land to churchmen, it is to be obſerved, that the few acres which may be granted to a Miſſionary-Miniſter, will not be of the nature of a <hi>glebe,</hi> legally and irredeemably annexed to a living, on the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they will be given only <hi>during,</hi> and revocable <hi>at</hi> pleaſure. The tranſaction will be of the nature of a covenant or bargain between two contracting parties. The Society, on the one part, ſhall agree, that while the ſtate of the diſtrict ſhall require ſuch an eſtabliſhment, and the proprietor, or proprietors, ſhall continue to afford the ſtipulated accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, <hi>they</hi> ſhall allow to a miſſionary miniſter there, ſuch a ſalary as ſhall be ſpecified in the agreement. The terms on the part of the proprietor will exactly correſpond.</p>
                  <p>Neither party, it is to be preſumed, will ever act a part ſo abſurd, as, without evident neceſſity, to violate the conditions of a tranſaction of this public and important nature; but this much it ſeemed neceſſary to ſuggeſt, in order to remove the apprehenſions of the Society's deſign to lay perpetual unalterable burdens upon landed property.</p>
                  <p>Though the Secretary found that the above objections had made too deep an impreſſion upon the minds of ſome gentlemen of the Highlands, to leave room for hopes that <hi>they</hi> would agree to the conditions propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he had the happineſs to meet with others animated by a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpirit, who were fully convinced of the neceſſity of having a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of clergymen ſettled in theſe countries, and heartily diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to afford every accommodation neceſſary to render their ſituation comfortable and reſpectable. With one gentleman <note n="*" place="bottom">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

His conduct has been liberal in no common degree, and has made a correſponding impreſſion upon the minds of the Directors.</p>
                  <p>Other gentlemen have declared their willingneſs to act the ſame part, whoſe propoſals are under conſideration. Their example, it is to be hoped, will be followed by proprietors in other parts of the country where the defect of the means of inſtruction, and of the ordinances of religion, is one of the great evils felt and complaiued of by the people.</p>
                  <p>If the Society ſhall be willing to take upon themſelves the greateſt burden of eſtabliſhments of this nature, which certainly is the annual ſalaries of the miniſters, it cannot but appear hard, that gentlemen of rank and fortune ſhould deprive their own people of the benefit reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them, on account of the comparatively trifling expence of the accommodations required.</p>

Upon conſidering the general clauſes of the firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent erecting the Society into a corporation, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room for calling in queſtion the right of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0224400400:102"/>
to <hi>eſtabliſh miſſions</hi> upon their own proper funds. The will of Lady Glenorchy gives them undiſputable authority to this effect, over the intereſt of 2500 l. the unappropriated moiety of her legacy to the Directors. The vaſt extent of many paſtoral charges in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands and iſlands, and the abſolute impoſſibility of the few eſtabliſhed miniſters diſcharging with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and effect the duties of their office, render an
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0224400400:103"/>
increaſe of their number a moſt deſirable and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant object.</p>
            <p>The Secretary has mentioned, in the courſe of his Journal, a few places, in different parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where ſuch eſtabliſhments are greatly needed, and where the proprietors expreſſed a hearty willingneſs to give whatever accommodations the Directors might think proper to demand for the miniſters. Thoſe which the Secretary took the liberty to mention, and without which, in his opinion, no miſſion ought to be eſtabliſhed by the Society, are a comfortable dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe, with ſuitable offices (a ſtable, barn and byre), as much land free of rent, both arable and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as will maintain a horſe and two cows through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole year; and a decent place, or places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated for worſhip, wherever he ſhall be bound ſtatedly to perform divine ſervice.</p>
            <p>With theſe accommodations, and a competent ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (ſuppoſe 50l. <hi>per annum),</hi> a miniſter may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and reſpected in any part of the Highlands and Iſlands: without theſe he muſt be poor and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and conſequently his reſpect and uſefulneſs greatly obſtructed.</p>
            <p>If the Directors ſhall ſee proper to eſtabliſh miſſions, and they cannot do a more eſſential ſervice to thoſe countries to which, by the conſtitution of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their attention is confined, let them by all means take care, that the clergymen in their employment, be placed upon ſuch an independent footing as to have no temptation to ſervility of ſpirit, diſcontentment
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0224400400:104"/>
with their condition or for bread, to devote their time and attention to ſecular buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſixth,</hi> and the only other propoſition for the employment of their additional funds, which the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſhall take the liberty to mention, is, <hi>a proviſion to be made for training up ſome young men having the Gaelic Language, for the</hi> miniſtry, <hi>in the Highlands and Iſlands.</hi> This may be accompliſhed by the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a certain ſpeciſied number of penſions or burſavies for <hi>Students of Divinity.</hi> For Students of Philoſophy, there is not ſo much occaſion. The rules of the different Univerſities, as well as the laws of the Church, oblige every young man intended for the miniſtry, to ſtudy a regular courſe of Philoſophy; and during that courſe there are many more aids from burſaries to be obtained than in that of Divinity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, were the Society to eſtabliſh burſaries for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, they could have no ſecurity that the young men who enjoyed them, would proſecute the ſtudy of Divinity.</p>
            <p>What the Secretary therefore begs leave to ſuggeſt upon this ſubject is, that ſuch young men, having the Gaelic language, and having finiſhed their courſe of philoſophy, as the Directors may chooſe to prefer, ſhall undergo an examination by ſome of their own members; and upon being found to have made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent progreſs in their ſeveral branches of education, ſhall be appointed each to a penſion, or burſary, <hi>(of ſuppoſe</hi> 15 <hi>l.)</hi> upon theſe expreſs conditions, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring four ſeſſions (the duration of the burſary) they ſhall reſide comſtantly at Edinburgh, and thus be under
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0224400400:105"/>
the immediate inſpection of the eccleſiaſtical members of the Society, and enjoy the benefit of their advice and patronage, if they ſhall be found to deſerve it; that they ſhall regularly attend the Divinity Hail, and the ſeveral Profeſſors, whoſe claſſes ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them, and without engaging in any other buſineſs, ſhall devote their whole time and attention to their proper ſtudies.</p>
            <p>By this plan, through the Divine bleſſing, it is to be hoped, that a ſucceſſion of able and well educated young men may be trained up for ſupplying the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which may be eſtabliſhed by the Society, as well as other charges in the Highlands and Iſlands.</p>
            <p>Thus the Secretary has taken the liberty to ſtate to the Directors the ideas which have occurred to him upon this moſt intereſting ſubject. The nature of his office, and his conſtant employment in the aſſairs of the Society, may naturally be ſuppoſed to have direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of his attention to the inſtitution, and to all thoſe methods by which its great and benevolent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may beſt be promoted; and the above plan, after mature deliberation, appears to him the beſt which they can adopt for employing their additional funds. He ſubmits it, with deference, to the conſideration of his conſtituents."</p>
            <p>The Directors having read and conſidered the above paper, with much attention, reſerred it to a general meeting of the Society, by whom the ſpirit and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the plan contained in it, were unanimouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and referred back to the Directors to be ſtill more maturely digeſted, and carried into execution, as circumſtances may permit.</p>
            <p>

By ordering it to be printed, as a part of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the anniverſary ſermon of the preſent year, the Directors will have an opportunity of learning the ſentiments of the public concerning it; <hi>of thoſe</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly who have directed their attention to the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Highlands and Iſlands, and the means moſt proper to be uſed for their improvement.—The publication of theſe propoſals, beſides, will have the effect to ſatisfy the public, that although the funds of the Society have of late received a large addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet objects of great importance to the country are by no means wanting, ſufficient, and far more than ſufficient, to exhauſt them. The Directors are fully determined againſt hoarding up, or wrapping in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, the talents committed to them; on the contrary, in the ſpirit, with which they truſt their revenue has hitherto been managed, their fixed purpoſe is to lay out the <hi>whole,</hi> as ſpeedily as prudence will permit, in promoting thoſe objects which ſhall appear to be beſt calculated for promoting the improvement of theſe parts of the kingdom to which their attention is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. The meaſures which they may adopt for this purpoſe ſhall, from time to time, be faithfully ſtated to the public. If they ſhall be ſo happy as to preſerve their continuing confidence; and, above all, if their faithful endeavours ſhall be crowned with ſucceſs in promoting the beſt intereſts of religion and their fellow creatures, a monitor within their own boſoms will tell them that THEIR REWARD IS GREAT.</p>
