            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>Lo! <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It were to be wiſhed that Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> had expreſſed himſelf with greater preciſion on this ſubject: However, thus much may be affirmed with truth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt, By the general tenour of his Eſſays on <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and the <hi>Freedom of Wit and Humour,</hi> it appears that his principal deſign was to recommend the <hi>Way of Ridicule</hi> (as he calls it) for the <hi>Inveſtigation</hi> of Truth, and <hi>Detection</hi> of Falſhood, not only in <hi>moral</hi> but <hi>religious</hi> ſubjects.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, It appears no leſs evident, that in the courſe of his reaſonings on this queſtion, he confounds two things which are in their nature and conſequences entirely different. Theſe are, <hi>Ridicule</hi> and <hi>Good-Humour:</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> acknowledged by all to be the beſt <hi>Mediator</hi> in every debate; the <hi>former</hi> no leſs regarded by moſt, as an <hi>Embroiler</hi> and <hi>Incendiary.</hi> Tho' he ſets out with a formal profeſſion of proving the efficacy of Wit, Humour, and Ridicule in the inveſtigation of Truth, yet by ſhifting and mixing his terms, he generally ſlides inſenſibly into mere encomiums on Good-Breeding, Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Urbanity, and free Enquiry. This indeed keeps ſomething like an argument on foot, and amuſes the ſuperficial reader; but to a more obſervant eye diſcovers a very contemptible defect either of ſincerity or penetration.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion concerning Ridicule may be thus not improperly ſtated: Whether <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Propoſitions of any kind can be <hi>aſcertained</hi> by the application of <hi>Ridicule?</hi> Much might be ſaid on this queſtion; but a few words will make the matter clear to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind.</p>
                     <p>The Diſapprobation or Contempt which certain objects raiſe in the mind of man, is a particular mode of Paſſion: the objects of this paſſion are <hi>apparent</hi> Falſhood, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, or Impropriety of ſome particular kinds. Thus, the object of Fear is <hi>apparent</hi> Danger, or probable approaching Ill. But who has ever dreamt of exalting the paſſion of <hi>Fear</hi> into a <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Teſt</hi> of <hi>real Danger?</hi> The deſign muſt have been rejected as abſurd, becauſe it is the work of Reaſon <hi>only,</hi> to correct and fix the paſſion on its proper objects. The caſe is parallel: <hi>apparent</hi> or <hi>ſeeming</hi> Falſhoods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the objects of Contempt; but it is the work of Reaſon <hi>only,</hi> to determine whether the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods be <hi>real</hi> or <hi>fictitious.</hi> But it is ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The <hi>Senſe of Ridicule</hi> can never be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken."</q>—Why, no more can the <hi>Senſe of Danger.</hi>—<q rend="inline">"What, do men never <hi>fear</hi> without reaſon?"</q>—Yes, very commonly; but they as often <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and <hi>laugh</hi> without reaſon. And thus, before any thing can be determined in either caſe, Reaſon, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only, muſt examine Circumſtances, ſeparate Ideas, decide upon, reſtrain, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that the <hi>way of Ridicule</hi> is in fact no more than a <hi>ſpecies of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:</hi> It applies to a Paſſion, and therefore can go no farther in the inveſtigation of Truth, than any of thoſe arts which tend to raiſe Love, Pity, Terror, Rage or Hatred in the heart of man. Conſequently, his Lordſhip might have tranſplanted the <hi>whole Syſtem of Rhetorick</hi> into his new ſcheme, with the ſame propriety as he hath introduced the <hi>way of Ridicule</hi> itſelf. A hopeful project this, for the propagation of Truth!</p>
                     <p>As this ſeems to be the real nature and tendency of Ridicule, it hath been generally diſcouraged by <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> together with every other mode of eloquence, when apply'd to <hi>controverted Opinions.</hi> This diſcouragement, from what is ſaid above, appears to have been rational and juſt; therefore the charge laid againſt <hi>Divines</hi> with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> (See a note on the <hi>Pleaſures of Imagination,</hi> Book III.) ſeems entirely groundleſs. The diſtinction which the ſame author hath attempted with reſpect to the influence of Ridicule, between <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>moral Truths,</hi> ſeems no better founded. It is certain that <hi>Opinions</hi> are no leſs liable to Ridicule than <hi>Actions.</hi> And it is no leſs certain that the way of Ridicule cannot <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> the Propriety or Impropriety of the <hi>one,</hi> more than the Truth or Falſhood of the <hi>other</hi>; becauſe the ſame paſſion of Contempt is equally engaged in both caſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as above) Reaſon <hi>only</hi> can examine the circumſtances of the <hi>Action</hi> or <hi>Opinion,</hi> and thus ſix the Paſſion on its <hi>proper</hi> Objects.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, this new deſign of <hi>diſcovering Truth</hi> by the <hi>vague</hi> and <hi>unſteady Light of Ridicule,</hi> puts one in mind of the honeſt <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> who apply'd his <hi>Candle</hi> to the <hi>Sun-Dial</hi> in order to ſee how the Night went.</p>
