            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS it is the wiſh of the Editor of theſe Obſervations to render them generally uſeful, pains have been taken to draw them up in ſuch language as ſhall be generally underſtood; with this view all technical terms and medical phraſes have been avoided as much as poſſible; where they have neceſſarily occured they are accompanied with ſuch explanations as it is hoped will render them perfectly intelligible to every capacity.</p>
            <p>In treating of wounds a good deal of minuteneſs has been employed; but he believes not more than is required when the importance of the ſubject is conſidered. To point out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt method of ſtopping violent bleedings, it was neceſſary to ſay ſomething on the relative ſituation of the veins and arteries, he truſts this has been done in as clear a manner as the ſubject will admit of; and doubts not but a little attention will render it perfectly underſtood.</p>
            <p>In deſcribing the uſe and application of the medicines the ſame perſpicuity has been attempted; and he hopes not attempted in vain. The doſes mentioned are for a grown perſon; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the perſon adminiſtering them will generally be ſufficient to direct him in any variation from the rules here laid down, that may be called for by particular circumſtances, ſuch as the patient's age, ſtrength, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To captains of ſhips this ſmall cheſt, with the remarks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this pamphlet, are particularly recommended. When at ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a they and their crews are cut off from the reſt of the world, and are indeed a little ſociety of themſelves. Thus circumſtanced the health and vigour of every individual becomes an object of conſiderable importance; in fact it is then a common concern, as few veſſels carry more people than are required, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:1252900800:4"/>of every one is neceſſary in order to perform the common duties of the ſhip; and the want of one man, diſabled by ſickneſs or accident, where the number of the crew is by no means ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, may prove in the end of very ſerious conſequence.</p>
            <p>To families at a diſtance from any town they are alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to be ſerviceable.—By an attentive peruſal of the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet little doubt is entertained but the meaneſt capacity will be enabled to hand relief in many inſtances, where much ſuffering and danger might be the conſequence of the delay occaſioned by waiting the arrival of a medical perſon from the diſtance of perhaps ſeveral miles, independant of the chance of his being from home, or engaged when ſent for.</p>
            <p>The Editor wiſhes to be underſtood that it is not in any manner his intention to ſuggeſt the inexpediency of calling in medical aid in every caſe which has the appearance of danger, or from which there may be a chance of danger reſulting; on the contrary he ſtrongly recommends it. He wiſhes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the minds of thoſe who may read this with the neceſſity of early medical advice in every ſuch caſe; and repeats that it is to thoſe only whoſe ſituation renders it impoſſible immediately to procure ſuch help, or to caſes which are ſlight and well underſtood, that this Medicine Cheſt is particularly adapted.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>On the uſe of the Tourniquet or Bandage, and manner of ſtepping violent Bleedings.</head>
               <p>IN treating of the management of wounds the firſt thing that demands our conſideration is the bleeding with which moſt of them are attended. When the blood is not poured out with great force, though the quantity ſhould even be conſiderable, it generally proceeds from wounded veins, and may be ſtopped by preſſing a piece of ſcraped lint, either alone or dipped in fine flour or Turlington's Balſam, upon the wound with the fingers. But when the Hood is thrown out with great force, and eſpecially if it ſprings out by jerks, it proceeds from wounded artcries, and requires the moſt ſerious attention.</p>
               <p>To direct us in this caſe, we muſt conſider the arteries as ſtrong branched pipes or tubes through which the blood is forced from the heart at each beat to every part of the trunk of the body, to the head, to the arms, and to the legs.— The veins ſpring in ſmall branches from all the parts the arteries carry blood to; they purſue their courſe towards the heart; joining with each other, forming gradually larger and larger veins, till they reach the heart in one large trunk. The heart may be compared to a ſort of forcing pump, throwing the blood along the arteries with ſuch force, that we can feel the jerk or pulſe wherever an artery lies: and the blood loſing its impulſe as it paſſes along, makes its way, without any pulſe or beating, into the veins, through which it returns to the heart, compleating what is called <hi>the circulation of the Hood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe ſimple principles the method of putting a ſtop to a bleeding from a wounded artery is exceedingly plain; that is, it muſt be compreſſed between the heart and the wound.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1252900800:6"/>
               <p>In wounds of the foot or leg the bleeding may be ſtopped by caſting a knot in the middle of a handkerchief, placing the knot in the ham or hollow behind the knee, tying it tight before, and twitching it ſufficiently by means of a ſtick, put between the place where we tye it and the thigh. The handkerchief ſhould be tightened as quickly as p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſible after it is put on, otherwiſe the veins will be painfully ſtretched. For a very ſlight preſſure on a vein ſtops the courſe of the blood in its return to the heart, whilſt the artery requiring more force to obſtruct it, keeps throwing blood into the veins of the limb, diſtending them as when we tye an arm up for bleeding.</p>
               <p>When the wound is in any part of the thigh a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief muſt be firmly knoted round the limb, between the place of the wound and the body; and muſt be twitched with a ſtick as before directed. But ſhould the wound be ſo high up as to leave no room for tying the handkerchief above it, a firm preſſure muſt be made, with the hand, on that part of the groin where the watch lies when the wound is of the right thigh, and on the left groin when the wound is of the left thigh.</p>
               <p>If an artery in the hand or arm is pouring out blood, we ſtop it by caſting a knot in a handkerchief, placing the knot on any part of that ſide of the arm which is next the body between the elbow and armpit, tying it round, and twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a ſtick as in wounds of the leg. And here it muſt be obſerved, that in dangerous bleedings, from wounds of the limbs, there is neither time nor neceſſity for ſtripping the part we apply the ligature to; for there is no doubt of lives having been loſt by attempts to undreſs the limb when an expeditious appheation of the handkerchief above the cloaths, but higher up than the wound, might have ſaved them.</p>
               <p>In wounds of the head or trunk of the body we command the bleeding by preſſing firmly with our ſingers on that border of the wound the blood ſprings from; and when we cannot determine which ſide the blood comes from, we preſs one ſide after another till we ſucceed.</p>
               <p>By theſe means, which it is every man's duty to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, the moſt violent bleeding may be ſtopped for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1252900800:7"/>ſome time; and where a ſurgeon can be had no more ſhould be attempted. But when it unfortunately happens that the wound is received at ſea, or where no ſurgical aſſiſtance can be obtained, a manly reſolution muſt be put on to ſave the ſufferer's life, which it is hoped the following directions will aſſiſt.</p>
               <p>A temporary ſtop being put to the bleeding by one or other of the forementioned methods, the wound ſhould be cleared of clotted blood, or whatever elſe may happen to ſtick to it, by waſhing it gently with a ſponge and milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm water. It ſhould next be dried, and the preſſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the artery, by raiſing the finger, in caſes of wounds of the head or body, and by untwiſting the ſtick of the handkerchief or tourniquet in wounds of the limbs, in order that the flow of blood may direct us to the mouth of the wounded artery. We now take notice of the place the blood ſprings from, and immediately renew the preſſure by the fingers or twitch; and by again waſhing the ſore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find the opening, which will ſeldom be difficult when the wound is large and open, and the artery of any conſequence. If the blood proceeds from a wound in the ſide of an artery, the wounded part of it may be raiſed up by means of a large needle, ſo as to allow a piece of double waxed thread to be paſſed under it on the ſide next the heart, and firmly tied round the artery, taking care to leave the ends of the thread ſo long as to hang quite out of the wound.—The ſame ſhould be done on the other end of the opening if the artery is large. But when an artery is quite cut in two, the ends ſoon ſhrink amongſt the fleſh, ſo that the bleeding is ſometimes ſtopped in both of them; almoſt always in that moſt diſtant from the heart; for then no blood paſſes into it but by ſmall branches between it and the other arteries of the limb.</p>
               <p>For the moſt part, however, the upper end in large arteries, continues to throw out dangerous quantities of blood, which we muſt endeavour to ſtop by drawing it out with a needle, and tying it firmly with a double waxed thread.</p>
               <p>When the end of a limb is carried away by a cannon ball the bleeding is ſeldom very alarming, for even large arteries are, in that caſe, cloſed up by the bruiſed parts. But we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1252900800:8"/>ſhould not entirely depend upon this, as the larger ones gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally break out again in a ſhort time when we are not aware of it, and ſo prove fatal. We are, therefore, to put the twitch round the limb, but without tighteaing it, to waſh away the clotted blood with a ſponge and warm water, in order to diſcover the end of the artery, that it may be tied as before directed.</p>
               <p>This method of ſecuring wounded arteries is certainly the ſafeſt and beſt when it can be followed; but caſes may occur where, either from want of courage, or of dexterity, it does not anſwer; in theſe recourſe muſt be had to the following:</p>
               <p>Having diſcovered, by the means already deſcribed, the mouth of the bleeding artery, or at leaſt the part of the wound in which it is ſituated, we preſs a piece of ſponge of a convenient ſize firmly upon it; over this we lay a piece of ſcraped lint, folded up and dipped in Turlington's Balſam, and then ſome pieces of linen rag, folded up as if for bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, each a little larger than that laid on before it, till a pile is raiſed an inch or two above the edges of the wound according to the ſize of the wound; binding the whole firmly down with a bandage of linen about three inches broad, and ſo long as to cover the limb with two or three plies, extending at leaſt four inches each way from the wound.</p>
               <p>The ſufferer muſt now be laid in bed, in ſuch a manner that the wounded part may lie eaſy and undiſturbed, and not too much covered with bedeloaths. Nor where the wounded artery is large muſt the handkerchief be removed from the upper part of the limb for three or four days; nor muſt the patient be left alone during that period for any length of time, ſince ſtartings of the part, or many other cauſes, may give riſe to repeated bleedings, which might be prevented from proving fatal by immediately tightening the handkerchief or tourniquet. In this ſtate the wound muſt remain for the ſpace of four or five days, or until the dreſſings are looſened by the formation of matter, when it muſt be managed in the ſame manner as other wounds with loſs of ſubſtance, which we ſhall fully deſcribe under the next head.</p>

               <head>TREATMENT OF WOUNDS.</head>
               <p>HITHERTO we have confined ourſelves to the means of ſtopping the diſcharge of blood from wounded arteries, we are next to conſider the moſt proper mode of dreſſing every variety of wounds; and for the ſake of method begin with thoſe moſt eaſy of cure.</p>
               <p>Of this kind are clean fleſh-wounds running in the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the limbs on which they are ſituated; for here we can avail ourſelves of the diſpoſition which the edges of ſuch wounds have to grow together when they touch each other conſtantly, by what is called adheſive inflammation, and by which the healing of a conſiderable wound will ſometimes be effected in three or four days, ſo as to require no farther care than avoiding ſuch accidents as might tear it open again before the part regains its ſtrength.</p>
               <p>In every clean wound therefore where there is no bleeding artery, or where we have been able to tye it, as this method is admiſſible recourſe ſhould be had to it. The firſt thing to be done is to make the wound as clean as poſſible by means of a ſponge and warm water; and having abſorbed as much as we can of the blood from its ſurface, the ſurrounding ſkin muſt be dried with a cloth, and whilſt another perſon holds the edges of the wound nicely and cloſely together with his fingers, but ſo as to be out of our way, ſtrips of ſticking plaiſter, from three to ſix inches in length, and from a quarter to half an inch in breadth, are to be laid right acroſs the wound, a ſtraw's breadth diſtant from each other; warming them as they are applied, to make them ſtick more readily, and carefully drying the ſkin wherever the leaſt moiſture appears.</p>
               <p>If an artery has been tied in the wound the ends of the thread muſt he brought out at that edge they are neareſt to, and ſhould be left of ſuch a length as to reach an inch beyond it, when the wound muſt be cloſed, and the ſtrips of plaiſter applied as before. And here it may be uſeful to obſerve that the perſon who aſſiſts us ſhould lay his ſingers on the ſtrips as we proceed to ſecure them more effectually. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1252900800:10"/>tract of the wound muſt now be covered with a piece of ſeraped lint, and over this we muſt lay a piece of the ſame thinly ſpread with <hi>cerate,</hi> and ſo large as to reach half an inch in every direction beyond the firſt piece. And laſtly, this dreſſing muſt be ſecured by binding the part neatly up with a linen bandage, reaching a hand's-breadth each way from the wound. The wound being thus dreſſed it muſt be kept quite eaſy and unmoved till the fourth day, when the bandage muſt be cantiouſly unfolded, ſoftening it with a ſponge and warm water if it is glued together with the blood. The lint muſt be next removed, and if there are threads hanging out from tied arteries they may be very gently drawn; but if they are not diſpoſed to come away eaſily they muſt not be forced, but tried at each fature dreſſing till they are quite looſe. After examining the threads, the ſticking plaiſters muſt be removed; and having gently wiped away any matter that may be found on the ſore, or on the adjoining ſkin, they may be renewed but in leſs number, and alſo the lint, the lint ſpread with cerate, and the handage. This mode of dreſſing muſt be repeated daily, and continued ſo long as the threads remain, any matter appears on the wound, or its edges continue tender; but when theſe appearances ceaſe, allowing the ſame dreſſing to remain, a few days will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the cure.</p>
               <p>We have dwelt particularly on this mode of curing wounds, as it is the moſt ſatisfactory in its conſequences, the moſt deſirable when ever it can be uſed, and may ſerve as a model for ſome part of the treatment of the deſcription of wounds we are next to conſider.</p>
               <p>Wherever there is a loſs of ſubſtance in wounds, or where there is ſuch a vacancy left between the ſides of the wound, by the ſhrinking of the divided ſkin and fleſh, as renders it impoſſible to keep them together by ſtrips of ſticking plaiſter or bandages, a diſſerent and much more tedious method of cure alone remains for us. A bruiſed or ragged wound, or one we have been obliged to ſill with ſcraped lint, ſponge, &amp;c. for reſtraining the diſcharge of blood muſt be treated exactly in the ſame manner.</p>

               <p>The proceſs which nature follows in the repair of theſe injuries is admirable, and muſt be attended to before we can manage the treatment of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing obſervable in wounds whoſe edges are leſt open is, that the ſurface of the wound is in every inſtance thrown off by the formation of matter under it. Sometimes this ſurface is ſo thin as almoſt to eſcape no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; at others thick, and is then called a ſlough or ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. And where much violence has been done to the ſtructure of the part by a bruiſe, or where the habit of body is faulty, the ſlough is ſometimes of a very ſerious ſize as happens in caſes of gangrene. The colour of ſloughs varies with their degree of importance; the ſlight ones, when they are not tinged with blood, are of a buff dolour; the more ſerious ones are aſh coloured, mixed here and there with black, brown, green, and yellow. No ſooner are theſe ſloughs diſcharged than the matter becomes cream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured and thick; the ſurface of the fore looks red and clean; the cavity of the wound gradually fills up with tender granulations, or now fleſh, to the level of the adjoining ſkin; and laſtly, a thin rind begins to form round the edges, which extending inwards, becomes the future ſkin.</p>
               <p>Having taken this ſlight view of the healing proceſs, in wounds whoſe edges are left open, we are prepared to enter upon their treatment. Clean wounds of this kind muſt be filled lightly with ſcraped lint; ragged or bruiſed ones with the ſame dipped in Turlington's Balſam. Over this a pledgit of baſilicon, ſpread upon ſine tow, muſt be laid, and then a nice bolſter of tow, binding the whole on with a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. In this ſtate the part muſt remain till the fourth day, when the matter generally looſens the dreſſings ſo as to make their removal eaſy. At this time we take away all that is looſe, or can be rendered ſo by moiſtening with warm milk and water; but clip off the ends of thoſe pieces of lint that ſtill ſtick to the ſore. We lay on a little freſh lint, renew the plaiſter, bolſter of tow and bandage, and change this dreſſing daily, gently wiping the edges of the ſore with a piece of tow, to remove any ſuperfluous matter, and taking care not to cram it with the lint. And when the cavity is filled up we muſt change the baſilicon pledgit for one of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1252900800:12"/>cerate, covering the ſurface with a ſingle piece of lint rather larger than the ſore, and laid with its ſofteſt ſide downwards, ſtill dreſſing once a-day till the cure is complete.</p>
               <p>When a wound is attended with a high degree of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſwelling, or its edges are hard and projecting, white bread poultices muſt be applied once or twice a day above the pledgit inſtead of the bolſter and bandage, and in that caſe the patient may take a cooling purge, ſuch as ſalts.</p>
               <p>But when, on the other band, the ſurface of the ſkin around the ſore looks flabby and ſoft, is covered with bliſters, or the ſloughs are thick and ill coloured, the diſcharge thin, dark, and very offenſive to the ſmell, the bark muſt be given freely in the manner directed under that article in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. Towards the concluſion of the cure of ſores the new granulations ſometimes riſe above the ſurface of the ſound ſkin, forming what is called fungous, or proud fleſh, this may be kept down by touching it occaſionally with a piece of wetted blue vitriol, which will in ſuch a caſe amazingly haſten the healing.</p>
               <p>Balls, ſplinters of wood, bone, or glaſs, pieces of the cloaths, or any kind of extraneous ſubſtance found in a wound, muſt be immediately removed if that can be done by gentle means, as they for the moſt part abſolutely prevent the cure, and are often productive of diſtreſſing and dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. But where their removal is difficult they muſt be ſuffered to remain till they are looſened by the digeſtion of the wound, or till the caſe comes under the management of a ſkilful ſurgeon, whoſe aſſiſtance theſe few directions are never deſigned to ſuperſede.</p>

               <head>SCALDS AND BURNS.</head>
               <p>SLIGHT ſcalds may be ſmeared three or four times a-day with a mixture of three ſpoonfuls of olive oil, one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate, and thirty drops of Goulard's Extract, and covered with a piece of ſoft rag moiſtened with the ſame. If a few ſmall bliſters ſhould riſe do not diſturb them for a day or two, when the pain and inflammation will probably be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1252900800:13"/>gone, they may then be diſcharged by ſnipping them in places with a pair of ſciſſars, and the ſore muſt afterwards be dreſſed with cerate only.</p>

            <p>THE inſtances of apparent death moſt frequently met with, and which come moſt within the plan of this work, are thoſe ariſing from drowning, hanging, exceſſive drinking, or breathing air which is unfit for the purpoſes of animal life, by being impregnated with noxious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as by charcoal burning in a cloſe place, the vapour from ſulphur, mine damps, &amp;c.

               <p>HANGING occaſions death by compreſſing the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and conſequently ſtopping the breathing, and obſtructing the return of the blood to the heart by the jugular veins.

               <head>EXCESSIVE DRINKING.</head>
               <p>THE effects of exceſſive drinking are frequently ſatal, from little or no attention being paid to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and frequently helpleſs object. The vulgar notion, <hi>that nothing can hurt a drunken man,</hi> has been the loſs of many
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1252900800:16"/>a life. From this erroneous opinion, when a perſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come what is termed dead drunk, he is ſuffered to tumble and roll about almoſt without notice. He is then in the greateſt danger. The quantity which he has drank generally begets an inclination to vomit; in attempting which, he gets his head over the ſide of the bed, or into ſome other poſition, with his head downwards, and not being attended 10, that ſituation, added to the tightneſs of his ſhirt-neck or neckcloth, produces ſuffocation; and we have ſeen many inſtances where the unhappy perſon has been found next morning quite dead.</p>
               <p>From theſe conſiderations it will appear evident how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is to pay ſome attention to people in this condition. The firſt ſtep ſhould be to looſen the neckcloth, ſhirt-neck, night-cap ſtrings, or any thing which is about the neck, and to place the body in a ſuitable poſition. The beſt poſition is laying, with the head and ſhoulders raiſed; if the patient is ſuffered to ſit there is a danger of his head hanging down too much upon his breaſt, by which the circulation of the blood in the neck is obſtructed, and an apoplectic ſtate is brought on.</p>
               <p>During the time that he is ſo extremely drunk he muſt not be left alone leſt be tumble out of bed in his ſtruggling. If notwithſtanding theſe precautions he ſhould ſenſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cold, and appear to be growing worſe, a clyſter may be given without delay, compoſed equal parts of wine and hot water, with a ſmall table ſpoonful of flour of muſtard, or a tea ſpoonful of powdered ginger or pepper. Rum, brandy, or gin, mixed with ſix times its quantity of hot water, with the addition of muſtard, &amp;c. may be uſed inſtead of wine. To keep up a proper degree of warmth the ſame means muſt be uſed as directed under the article drowning.</p>
               <p>The exceſſive degree of thirſt occaſioned by drinking ſtrong liquors often induce people to quench it by taking what is hurtful. The ſafeſt drink after a debauch is water with a toaſt, barley water, or tea.</p>
               <p>Exceſſive drinking is a failing we cannot ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. Of its effects we can hardly ſay too much; as it is impoſſible to ſay what are the conſequences which ariſe from it not only to the individual himſelf but to the community
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1252900800:17"/>at large. A perſon who gives himſelf up to hard drinking greatly hazards his own exiſtence, and renders himſelf inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of fulfilling the duties of his ſtation in life. If he is in a ſituation of truſt he ill merits the confedence repoſed in him. If a ſea-faring parſon ſuch a conduct is more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially blameable, as the ſucceſs of his voyage is thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered precarious, and the property of his employers, and the lives and ſafety of thoſe under him, are frequently expoſed through his miſconduct to imminent peril.</p>

               <p>IT frequently happens that in eaſes of apparent death from noxious vapours, or being ſtruck down by lightning, if the perſon is diſcovered ſoon, that the heat of the body is even greater than that of a living perſon. In this caſe good effects have been obſerved from daſhing the face and the whole body with cold water, thrown in ſmall quantities, and with ſome force.

               </gap>ſe, or a feather dipped in it may be put up the noſtril. Half a tea ſpoonful of it may be mixed with half a cup of water, and taken in faintings and fits. One table ſpoonful of it and two of olive oil, well mixed, by ſhaking them together in a hottle, make a lintment very uſeful for rubbing on parts ſwelled from rheumatiſm, for ſore throats, or ſwellings of the face from expoſure to ſevere cold, and for ſprains where there is no unuſual heat or inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The part ſhould be rubbed three or four times a day, and covered with flannel.</p>
            <p>SPIRIT OF NITRE.—Six tea ſpoonfuls of this and one of ſpirit of hartſhorn may be mixed, and a tea ſpoonful taken in a little barley water every three hours where ſweating is required. Its effect will be greatly promoted by drinking freely of barley water, thin gruel, or balm tea.</p>
            <p>BASILIGON OINTMENT.—Uſeful in the firſt ſtage of every wound whoſe edges cannot be brought together. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the formation of good matter, which may be known by its being thick and of a crean, colour. It is the moſt proper dreſſing for boils and collections of matter after they burſt.

            <p>RHUBARB.—A purging medicine. Doſe from half a dram to a dram, in a little mint water.</p>
            <p>TINCTURE OF RHUBARB.—For colicky complaints and gripings. Two table ſpoonfuls, with an equal quantity of

Where the pain is very great and the perſon ſtrong, bleeding would be proper. If the vomiting is ſo great that the pills are thrown up, and are ſeen, they muſt be repeated directly, waſhing them down with a tea ſpoonful of the anodyne tincture in two table ſpoonfuls of mint water. Drinking much muſt be avoided at this time, as taking any liquid will increaſe the inclination to vomit.</p>
            <p>In order to prevent a return of the colic coſtiveneſs muſt be avoided. The belly ſhould be opened by taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally half a dram of rhubarb and an equal quantity of magneſia in the morning faſting, in a little mint water.</p>
            <p>STICKING PLAISTER.—May be uſed for parts where the ſkin is rubbed off, alſo as a ſtrengthening plaiſter. It is very uſeful in many wounds as already deſcribed.</p>
            <p>OLIVE OIL.—Uſeful in rheumatiſm, ſore throats, and ſwellings, (ſee ſpirit of hartſhorn) alſo in ſcalds as already mentioned. For coughs moiſten a piece of loaf ſugar in it, and let it diſſolve ſlowly in the mouth whenever the cough is troubleſome. For pains in the ear mix equal parts of olive oil and anodyne tincture, dip a piece of lint in it and put into the ear.</p>
            <p>LINT AND TOW.—Their uſes are already deſcribed in treating of wounds.</p>
            <p>IPECACUAN.—For vomits. Doſe from a ſcruple to half a dram, taken in half a cup of water, and worked off with camomile tea.</p>
