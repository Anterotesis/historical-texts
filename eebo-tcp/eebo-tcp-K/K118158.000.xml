            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOME years ſince I publiſhed a complete Treatiſe on Menſuration, both in Theory and Practice; in which the Elements of that Science are demonſtrated, and the Rules applied to the various practical pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of life. That work has been well received by the Public, and honoured with the high approbation of the more learned Mathematicians.</p>
            <p>It has, however, been often repreſented to me, by Tutors and others, that the great ſize and price of that work, as well as the very ſcientific manner in which it is formed, prevent it from being ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſeful in ſchools, and to practical meaſurers, as a more compendious and familiar little book might be, which they could put into the hands of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, as a work containing all the practical rules of that art, in a form proper for them to copy from, and unmixed with ſuch geometrical and algebraical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations as occur in the large work.</p>
            <p>In compliance, therefore, with ſuch repreſentations, I have drawn up this Compendium of Menſuration, Practical Geometry, and Arithmetic, expreſsly with the view of accommodating it to practical matters, and to the uſe of ſchools. I have, therefore, here brought together all the moſt uſeful rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; have arranged them in an orderly manner, proper for the pupil to copy; and delivered them in plain and familiar language. An example, worked out at full length, is ſet down to each rule, together with drawings or repreſentations of the geometrical figures proper to illuſtrate each problem; and then are ſubjoined ſome more queſtions to each rule, as examples propoſed for the practice of the learner, with
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0920200400:3"/>the anſwer ſet down, by which he may know when his work is right.</p>
            <p>The introduction to Decimal and Duodecimal Arithmetic, will be found uſeful, by going over thoſe branches before entering on the Menſuration, that the learner may be very ready and expert in numeral calculations.</p>
            <p>The Practical Geometry contains a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of geometrical conſtructions and operations; by the practice of which the learner will acquire the free and eaſy uſe of his inſtruments, and ſo become prepared for making the drawings that are uſeful for illuſtrating the various branches of menſuration fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>The Menſuration itſelf next ſucceeds, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into various parts; firſt, Menſuration in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and then as applied to the ſeveral practical uſes in life. The whole being arranged in ſuch order as the learner may properly take in ſucceſſion; or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into ſeveral branches, of which he may ſelect and ſtudy any peculiar ones that may be more to his purpoſe than the reſt, when he either has not leiſure or inducement to go over the whole in a regular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. And notwithſtanding the compendious ſize of the book, and the great number of practical branches here treated, it will be found that each one is much more full and complete than the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſo ſmall a form may promiſe to admit of. However, if farther ſatisfaction be deſired by any one, either concerning the ſcience in general, or the demonſtrations of the rules, or the more curious and copious diſplay of properties, he may apply to my large treatiſe before mentioned, where he will find every part delivered in the moſt ample form.</p>

                  <p>A Decimal is a fraction whoſe denominator is an unit, or 1, with ſome number of ciphers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; as 1/10 or 45/10000.</p>
                  <p>Decimals are written down without their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, the numerators being ſo diſtinguiſhed as to ſhew what the denominators are; which is done, by ſeparating, by a point, ſo many of the right-hand figures from the reſt as there are ciphers in the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator; the figures on the left ſide of the point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing integers, and thoſe on the right decimals.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Thus, 0.5 is underſtood to be 5/10 or ½</item>
                     <item>And 0.25 is underſtood to be 25/100 or ¼</item>
                     <item>And 0.75 is underſtood to be 75/100 or ¾</item>
                     <item>And 1.3 is underſtood to be 13/10 or 1 3/10</item>
                     <item>And 24.6 is underſtood to be 24 6/10</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But when there is not a ſufficient number of figures in the numerator, ciphers are prefixed to ſupply the defect.</p>

                  <p>A finite decimal, is that which ends at a certain number of places. But an infinite decimal, that which no where ends, but is underſtood to be indefinitely continued.</p>
                  <p>A repeating decimal, has one figure, or ſeveral figures continually repeated. As 20.2433 &amp;c. which is a ſingle or ſimple repetend. And 20.2424 &amp;c. or 20.246246 &amp;c. which are compound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petends; and are otherwiſe called circulates, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating decimals. A point is ſet over a ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petend, and a point over the firſt and laſt figures of a circulating decimal.</p>

I divide 1.000 by 29, in the common way, ſo far as to find two or three of the firſt figures, or till the remainder becomes a ſingle figure, and then I aſſume the ſupplement to complete the quotient. Thus I ſhall have 1/29=0.03448 8/29 for the complete quotient; which equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if I multiply by the numerator 8, it will give 8/29=0.27584 64/29 or rather 8/29=0.27586 6/29. I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this inſtead of the fraction in the firſt equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I ſhall have 1/29=0.0344827586 6/29. Again I multiply this equation by 6, and it will give 6/29=0.2068965517 7/29, and then by ſubſtitution 1/29=0.03448275862068965517 7/29. Again, I multiply this equation by 7, and it becomes 7/29=0.24137931034482758620 10/29, and then by ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1/29=0.03448275862068965517241379310344 82758620 10/29, where every operation will at leaſt double the number of figures found by the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing operation.

                  <p>A POWER is a number produced by multiplying any given number continually by itſelf a certain number of times.</p>
                  <p>Any number is called the firſt power of itſelf; if it be multiplied by itſelf, the product is called the ſecond power, and ſometimes the ſquare; if this be multiplied by the firſt power again, the product is called the third power, and ſometimes the cube; and if this be multiplied by the firſt power again, the product is called the fourth power, &amp;c. that is, the power is denominated from the number which exceeds the number of multiplications by 1.</p>
                  <p>Thus: 3 is the firſt power of 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 x 3=9 is the ſecond power of 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 x 3 x 3=27 is the third power of 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 x 3 x 3 x 3=81 is the fourth power of 3.</p>

                  <head>EVOLUTION; OR EXTRACTION OF ROOTS.</head>
                  <p>The root of any given number, or power, is ſuch a number, as being multiplied by itſelf a certain number of times, will produce the power; and it is denominated the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, &amp;c. root, reſpectively, as the number of multiplications made of it to produce the given power is 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. that is, the name of the root is taken from the number which exceeds the multiplications by 1, like the name of the power in involution.</p>
                  <p>The index of the root, like that of the power in involution, is 1 more than the number of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications neceſſary to produce the power or given number. So 2 is the index of the ſecond or ſquare root; and 3 the index of the 3d or cubic root; and 4 the index of the 4th root; and ſo on.</p>
                  <p>Roots are ſometimes denoted by writing √ before the power, with the index of the root againſt it: ſo the third root of 50 is 3√50, and the ſecond root of it is √50, the index 2 being omitted, which index is always underſtood when a root is named or written without one, but if the power be expreſſed by ſeveral numbers with the ſign + or −, &amp;c. between them, then a line is drawn from the top of the ſign of the root or radical ſign, over all the parts of it; ſo the third root of 47−15 is <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. and ſometimes roots are deſigned like powers, with the reciprocal or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0920200400:41"/>the index of the root above the given number. So the root of 3 is 3<hi rend="sup">½</hi>, the root of 50 is 50<hi rend="sup">½</hi>, and the third root of it is 50⅓, alſo the third root of 47—15 is <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And this method of notation has juſtly prevailed in the modern algebra; becauſe ſuch roots, being conſidered as fractional powers, need no other directions for any operations to be made with them, than thoſe for integral powers.</p>
                  <p>A number is called a complete power of any kind, when its root of the ſame kind can be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately extracted; but if not, the number is called an imperfect power, and its root a ſurd or irrational quantity. So 4 is a complete power of the ſecond kind, its root being 2; but an imperfect power of the third kind, its third root being a ſurd quantity, which cannot be accurately extracted.</p>
                  <p>Evolution is the finding of the roots of numbers, either accurately, or in decimals to any propoſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of accuracy.</p>
                  <p>The power is firſt to be prepared for extraction, or evolution, by dividing it, by means of points or commas, from the place of units, to the left hand in integers, and to the right in decimal fractions, into periods, containing each as many places of figures as are denoted by the index of the root, if the power contain a complete number of ſuch periods; that is each period to have two figures for the ſquare root, three for the cube root, four for the fourth root, and ſo on. And when the laſt period in decimals is not complete, ciphers are added to compleat it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> The root will contain juſt as many places of figures as there are periods or points in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0920200400:42"/>the given power; and they will be integers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimals reſpectively, as the periods are ſo from which they are found, or to which they correſpond; that is, there will be as many integer or decimal figures in the root, as there are periods of integers or deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in the given number.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Find how often the diviſor is contained in the dividend, wanting its laſt figure on the right hand; place that number for the next figure in the quotient, and on the right of the diviſor, as alſo below the ſame.</p>

Multiply the whole increaſed diviſor by it, placing the product below the dividend, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from it, and to the remainder bring down the next period, for a new dividend; to which, as before, find a diviſor by doubling the figures already found in the root; and from theſe find the next figure of the root, as in the laſt article; and continue the

Theſe multiplied make alſo 81, ſet below the dividend, and ſubtracting, we have 49 remaining, to which the laſt period 56 being brought down, we have 4956 for the new dividend.

And when the root is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to a great number of places, the work may be much abbreviated thus: having proceeded in the extraction after the common method till you have found one more than half the required number of figures in the root, the reſt may be found by divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt remainder by its correſponding diviſor, annexing a cipher to every dividual, as in diviſion of decimals; or rather, without annexing ciphers, by omitting continually the right-hand figure of the diviſor, after the manner of the third contraction in diviſion of decimals in page 10.</p>

                  <head>TO FIND TWO MEAN PROPORTIONALS.</head>
                  <p>There are many uſes of the cube root; one is to find two mean proportionals between two given numbers, which is performed thus:</p>
                  <p>Divide the greater extreme by the leſs, and the cube root of the quotient multiplied by the leſs extreme, gives the leſs mean. Multiply the ſaid cube root by the leſs mean, and the product is the greater mean proportional.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> This is only underſtood of thoſe numbers that are in continued geometric proportion.</p>
                  <p>EXAMPLE. I.</p>
                  <p>What are the two mean proportionals between 4 and 108?</p>
                  <p>108 divided by 4 gives 27, whoſe cube root is 3; and the leſs extreme 4, multiplied thereby, gives 12 for the leſs mean; and 12 multiplied by the ſaid root 3, gives 36 for the greater mean.</p>
                  <p>For 4 is to 12, as 36 to 108.</p>
                  <p>EXAMPLE II.</p>

                  <p>RULE II. TO EXTRACT THE CUBE ROOT.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By trials take the neareſt rational cube to the given cube or number, and call it the aſſumed cube.</p>

               <p>THIS inſtrument is otherwiſe called the ſliding rule; and it is much uſed in timber meaſuring and artificers works, both for taking the dimenſions, and caſting up the contents.</p>
               <p>The inſtrument conſiſts of two equal pieces, each a foot in length, which are connected together by a folding joint.</p>
               <p>One ſide or face of the rule, is divided into inches, and half-quarters, or eighths. On the ſame face alſo are ſeveral plane ſcales, divided into twelfth parts by diagonal lines; which are uſed in planning dimenſions that are taken in feet and inches. The edge of the rule is commonly divided decimally, or into tenths; namely each foot into 10 equal parts, and each of theſe into 10 parts again: ſo that by means of this laſt ſcale, dimenſions are taken in feet and tenths and hundredths, and multiplied as common decimal numbers, which is the beſt way.</p>
               <p>On the one part of the other face are four lines, marked A, B, C, D, the two middle ones B and C being on a ſlider, which runs in a groove made in the ſtock. The ſame numbers ſerve for both theſe two middle lines, the one being above the numbers, and the other below.</p>
               <p>Theſe four lines are logarithmic ones, and the three A, B, C, which are all equal to one another, are double
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0920200400:162"/>lines, as they proceed twice over from 1 to 10. The other or loweſt line D, is a ſingle one, proceeding from 4 to 40. It is alſo called the girt line, from its uſe in caſting up the contents of trees and timber; and upon it are marked WG at 17.15, and AG at 18.95, the wine and ale gage points, to make this inſtrument ſerve the purpoſe of a gaging rule.</p>
               <p>Upon the other part of this face there is a table of the value of a load, or 50 cubic feet, of timber, at all prices, from 6 pence to 2 ſhillings a foot.</p>
               <p>When 1 at the beginning of any line is accounted 1, then the 1 in the middle will be 10, and the 10 at the end 100; and when 1 at the beginning is accounted 10, then the 1 in the middle is 100, and the 10 at the end 1000; and ſo on.

                  <p>And by others they are girt or meaſured round for their breadth, and the height of the ſtory is their height, taking the depth of the jambs for their thickneſs.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note.</hi> Large and plain articles are uſually meaſured by the ſquare foot or yard, &amp;c. but inriched mouldings, and ſome other articles, are often eſtimated by running or lineal meaſure, and ſome things are rated by the piece.</p>
                  <p>In meaſuring of joiſts, it is to be obſerved, that only one of their dimenſions is the ſame with that of the floor; and the other will exceed the length of the room by the thickneſs of the wall, and ⅓ of the ſame, becauſe each end is let into the wall about ⅔ of its thickneſs.</p>
                  <p>No deductions are made for hearths, on account of the additional trouble and waſte of materials.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Partitions</hi> are meaſured from wall to wall for one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion, and from floor to floor, as far as they extend, for the other.</p>
                  <p>No deduction is made for door-ways, on account of the trouble of framing them.</p>
                  <p>In meaſuring of joiners work, the ſtring is made to ply cloſe to every part of the work over which it paſſes.</p>

                     <hi>The meaſure of centering for cellars</hi> is found by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtring paſs over the ſurface of the arch for the breadth, and taking the length of the cellar for the length; but in groin-centering, it is uſual to allow double meaſure, on account of their extraordinary trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In roofing,</hi> the length of the houſe in the inſide, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ⅔ of the thickneſs of one gable, is to be conſidered as the length; and the breadth is equal to double the length of a ſtring which is ſtretched from the ridge down the rafter, and along the eaves-board; till it meets with the top of the wall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For ſtair-caſes,</hi> take the breadth of all the ſteps, by making a line ply cloſe over them, from the top to the bottom, and multiply the length of this line by the length of a ſtep for the whole area.—By the length of a ſtep is meant the length of the front and the returns at the two ends, and by the breadth is to be underſtood the girt of its two upper ſurfaces, or the tread and riſer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the baluſtrade,</hi> take the whole length of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the hand-rail, and girt over its end till it meet the top of the newel poſt, for the length; and twice the length of the baluſter upon the landing, with the girt of the hand-rail, for the breadth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For wainſcotting,</hi> take the compaſs of the room for the length; and the height from the floor to the cieling, making the ſtring ply cloſe into all the mouldings, for the breadth.—Out of this muſt be made deductions for windows, doors, and chimneys, &amp;c. but workmanſhip is counted for the whole, on account of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For doors,</hi> it is uſual to allow for their thickneſs, by adding it into both the dimenſions of length and breadth, and then multiply them together for the area.—If the door be pannelled on both ſides, take double its meaſure for the workmanſhip; but if one ſide only be pannelled, take the area and its half for the workmanſhip.—<hi>For the ſurrounding architrave,</hi> gird it about the outermoſt part
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0920200400:180"/>for its length; and meaſure over it, as far as it can be ſeen when the door is open, for the breadth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Window-ſhutters, baſes,</hi> &amp;c. are meaſured in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>In the meaſuring of roofing for workmanſhip alone, all holes for chimney ſhafts and ſky-lights are generally deducted.</p>

                     <p>Alſo, an acre is divided into 4 parts called roods, and a rood into 40 parts called perches, which are ſquare poles, or the ſquare of a pole of 5¼ yards long, or the ſquare of ¼ of a chain, or of 25 links, which is 625 ſquare links. So that the diviſions of land meaſure will be thus:</p>

                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0920200400:199"/>1. A frame of wood, made to fit round its edges, and to be taken off, for the convenience of putting a ſheet of paper upon the table. The one ſide of this frame is uſually divided into equal parts, for drawing lines acroſs the table, parallel or perpendicular to the ſides; and the other ſide of the frame is divided into 360 degrees from a center which is in the middle of the table; by means of which the table is to be uſed as a theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A needle and compaſs ſcrewed into the ſide of the table, to point out the directions, and to be a check upon the ſights.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An index, which is a braſs two-foot ſcale, with either a ſmall teleſcope, or open ſights erected perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon the ends. Theſe ſights, and one edge of the index are in the ſame plane, and that edge is called the fiducial edge of the index.</p>
                     <p>Before you uſe this inſtrument, take a ſheet of paper which will cover it, and wet it to make it expand; then ſpread it flat upon the table, preſſing down the frame upon the edges, to ſtretch it and keep it fixed there; and when the paper is become dry, it will, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting again, ſtretch itſelf ſmooth and flat from any cramps or unevenneſs.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0920200400:200"/>as many of the objects as may be neceſſary, and no more, taking the requiſite offsets to corners or crooks in the hedges, &amp;c and lay the meaſures down upon their reſpective lines upon the table. Then, at any conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, meaſured to, fix the table in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ſet the objects which appear from thence, &amp;c. as before; and thus continue till your work is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, meaſuring ſuch lines as are neceſſary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining as many as you can by interſecting lines of direction drawn from different ſtations.</p>
                     <p>And in theſe operations obſerve the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cautions and directions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let the lines upon which you make ſtarions be directed towards objects as far diſtant as poſſible; and when you have ſet any ſuch object, go round the table and look through the ſights from the other end of the index, to ſee if any other remarkable object lie directly oppoſite; if there be not ſuch an one, endeavour to find another forward object, ſuch as ſhall have a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able backward oppoſite one, and make uſe of it rather than the other; becauſe the back object will be of uſe in fixing the table in the original poſition either when you have meaſured too near to the forward object, or when it may be hid from your ſight at any neceſſary ſtation by intervening hedges, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let the ſaid lines, upon which the ſtations are taken, be purſued as far as you conveniently can; for that will be the means of preſerving more accuracy in the work.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. At each ſtation it will be neceſſary to prove the truth of it; that is, whether the table be ſtraight in the line towards the object, and alſo whether the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be rightly meaſured and laid down on the paper.— To know if the table be ſet down ſtraight in the line; lay the index upon the table in any manner, and more the table about till through the ſights you perceive either the fore or back object; then, without moving the table, go round it and look through the ſights by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0920200400:201"/>the other end of the index, to ſee if the other object can be perceived; if it be, the table is in the line; if not, it muſt be ſhifted to one ſide, according to your judgment, till through the ſights both objects can be ſeen.—The aforeſaid operation only informs you if the ſtation be ſtraight in the line; but to know if it be in the right part of the line, that is, if the diſtance has been rightly laid down; fix the table in the original poſition, by laying the index along the ſtation line and turning the table about till the fore and back objects appear through the ſights, and then alſo will the needle point at the ſame degree as at firſt; then lay the index over the ſtation point and any other point on the paper repreſenting an object which can be ſeen from the ſtation; and if the ſaid object appear ſtraight through the ſights, the ſtation may be depended on as right; if not, the diſtance ſhould be examined and corrected till the object can be ſo ſeen. And for this very uſeful purpoſe, it is adviſeable to have ſome high object or two, which can be ſeen from the greateſt part of the ground, accurately laid down on the paper from the beginning of the ſurvey, to ſerve continually as proof objects.</p>
                     <p>When, from any ſtation, the fore and back objects cannot both be ſeen, the agreement of the needle with one of them may be depended on for placing the table ſtraight on the line, and for fixing it in the original poſition.</p>

                        <hi>Of ſhifting the Paper on the Plain Table.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When one paper is full, and you have occaſion for more; draw a line in any manner through the fartheſt point of the laſt ſtation line, to which the work can be conveniently laid down; then take the ſheet off the table, and fix another on, drawing a line upon it, in a part the moſt convenient for the reſt of the work; then ſold or cut the old ſheet by the line drawn on it, apply the edge to the line on the new ſheet, and, as they lie in that poſition, continue the laſt ſtation line upon the new paper, placing upon it the reſt of the meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0920200400:202"/>at where the old ſheet left off. And ſo on from ſheet to ſheet.</p>
                     <p>When the work is done, and you would faſten all the ſheets together into one piece, or rough plan, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid lines are to be accurately joined together, as when the lines were transferred from the old ſheets to the new ones.</p>
                     <p>But it is to be noted, that if the ſaid joining lines, upon the old and new ſheet, have not the ſame inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſide of the table, the needle will not point to the original degree when the table is rectified; and if the needle be required to reſpect ſtill the ſame degree of the compaſs, the eaſieſt way of drawing the lines in the ſame poſition, is to draw them both parallel to the ſame ſides of the table, by means of the equal diviſions mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other two ſides.</p>

                     <p>Begin at ſuch part of the ground, and meaſure in ſuch directions, as you judge moſt convenient; taking angles or directions to objects, and meaſuring ſuch diſtances as appear neceſſary, under the ſame reſtrictions as in the uſe of the plain table. And it is ſafeſt to ſix the theodolite in the original poſition at every ſtation by means of fore and back objects, and the compaſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as in uſing the plain table; regiſtering the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of degrees cut off by the index when directed to

                     <p>The beſt method of laying down the aforeſaid lines of direction, is to deſcribe a pretty large circle, quarter it, and lay upon it the ſeveral numbers of degrees cut off by the index in each direction; then, by means of a parallel ruler, draw, from ſtation to ſtation, lines parallel to lines drawn from the center to the reſpective points in the circumference.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0920200400:204"/>certainly the beſt; not only becauſe it may be uſed as a theodolite or ſemi-circle, by turning uppermoſt that ſide of the frame which has the 360 degrees upon it; but becauſe it is, in its own proper uſe, by much the eaſieſt, ſafeſt, and moſt accurate for the purpoſe; for by planning every part immediately upon the ſpot, as ſoon as meaſured, there is not only ſaved a great deal of writing in the field-book, but every thing can alſo be planned more eaſily and accurately while it is in view, than it can afterwards from a field-book, in which many little things muſt be either neglected or miſtaken; and beſides, the opportunities which the plain table afford of correcting your work, or proving if it be right, at every ſtation, are ſuch advantages as can never be balanced by any other method. But although the plain table be the moſt generally uſeful inſtrument, it is not <hi>always</hi> ſo; there being many caſes in which ſometimes one inſtrument is the propereſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another; nor is that ſurveyor maſter of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs who cannot in any caſe diſtinguiſh which is the fitteſt inſtrument or method, and uſe it accordingly: nay ſometimes no inſtrument at all, but barely the chain itſelf, is the beſt method, particularly in regular open fields lying together; and even when you are uſing the plain table, it is often of advantage to meaſure ſuch large open parts with the chain only, and from thoſe meaſures lay them down upon the table.</p>
                     <p>The perambulator is uſed for meaſuring roads, and other great diſtances on level ground, and by the ſides of rivers. It has a wheel of 8¼ feet, or half a pole, in circumference, upon which the machine turns; and the diſtance meaſured, is pointed out by an index, which is moved round by clock work.</p>
                     <p>Levels, with teleſcople or other ſights, are uſed to find the level between place and place, or how much one place is higher or lower than another.</p>
                     <p>An offſet-ſtaff is a very uſeful and neceſſary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for meaſuring the offſets and other ſhort diſtances.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0920200400:205"/>It is 10 links in length, being divided and marked at each of the 10 links.</p>
                     <p>Ten ſmall arrows, or rods of iron or wood, are uſed to mark the end of every chain length, in meaſuring lines. And ſometimes pickets, or ſtaves with flags, are ſet up as marks or objects of direction.</p>
                     <p>Various ſcales are alſo uſed in protracting and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring on the plan or paper; ſuch as plane ſcales, line of chords, protractor, compaſſes, reducing ſcale, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel and perpendicular rules, &amp;c. Of plane ſcales, there ſhould be ſeveral ſizes, as a chain in 1 inch, a chain in ¾ of an inch, a chain in ½ an inch, &amp;c. And of theſe, the beſt for uſe, are thoſe that are laid on the very edges of the ivory ſcale, to prick off diſtances by, without compaſſes.</p>

                     <p>In ſurveying with the plain table, a field-book is not uſed, as every thing is drawn on the table immediately when it is meaſured. But in ſurveying with the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolite, or any other inſtrument, ſome ſort of a field-book muſt be uſed, to write down in it a regiſter or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that is done and occurs relative to the ſurvey in hand.</p>
                     <p>This book every one contrives and rules as he thinks fitteſt for himſelf. The following is a ſpecimen of a form very generally uſed. It is ruled into 3 columns: the middle, or principal column, is for the ſtations, angles, bearings, diſtances meaſured,  and thoſe on the right and left are for the offsets on the right and left, which are ſet againſt their correſponding diſtances in the middle column; as alſo for ſuch remarks as may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, and be proper to note in drawing the plan, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Here ☉ 1 is the firſt ſtation, where the angle or bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is 105° 25′. On the left, at 73 links in the diſtance or principal line, is an offset of 92; and at 610 an offset of 24 to a croſs hedge. On the right, at o, or the beginning, an offset 25 to the corner of the field; at 248 Brown's boundary hedge commences; at 610
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0920200400:206"/>an offset 35; and at 954, the end of the firſt line, the o denotes its terminating in the hedge. And ſo on for the other ſtations.</p>

Having then ſtretched the chain, and ſtuck down an arrow, as before, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower takes up his arrow, and they advance again in the ſame manner another chain-length. And thus they proceed till all the 10 arrows are employed, and are in the hands of the follower; and the leader, without an arrow, is arrived at the end of the 11th chain length. The follower then ſends or brings the 10 arrows to the leader, who puts one of them down at the end of his chain, and advances with the chain as before. And thus the arrows are changed from the one to the other at every 10 chains length, till the whole line is finiſhed; when the number of changes of the arrows ſhews the number of tens, to which the follower adds the arrows he holds in his hand, and the number of links of an other chain over to the mark or end of the line. So if there have been 3 changes of the arrows, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower hold 6 arrows, and the end of the line cut off 45 links more, the whole length of the line is ſet down in links thus 3645.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Walk over the eſtate two or three times, in order to get a perfect idea of it, and till you can carry the map of it tolerably in your head.

                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0920200400:223"/>3. Take what angles, between the ſtations, you think neceſſary, and meaſure the diſtances from ſtation to ſtation, always in a right line: theſe things muſt be done, till you get as many angles and lines as are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for determining all your points of ſtation. And in meaſuring any of theſe ſtation diſtances, mark accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately where theſe lines meet with any hedges, ditches, roads, lanes, paths, rivulets, &amp;c. and where any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable object is placed, by meaſuring its diſtance from the ſtation line; and where a perpendicular from it cuts that line; and always mind, in any of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, that you be in a right line, which you will know by taking backſight and foreſight, along your ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion line. And thus as you go along any main ſtation line, take offsets to the ends of all hedges, and to any pond, houſe, mill, bridge, &amp;c. omitting nothing that is remarkable. And all theſe things muſt be noted down: for theſe are your data, by which the places of ſuch objects are to be determined upon your plan. And be ſure to ſet marks up at the interſections of all hedges with the ſtation line, that you may know where to meaſure from, when you come to ſurvey theſe particular fields, which muſt immediately be done, as ſoon as you have meaſured that ſtation line, whilſt they are freſh in memory.

Meaſure theſe ſtation lines as you did the firſt, and all their interſections with hedges, and all offsets to ſuch objects as appear. Then you may proceed to

For every ſtation line will be a baſis to all the future operations; the ſituation of all parts being entirely dependent upon them; and therefore they ſhould be taken as long as poſſible; and it is beſt for them to run along ſome of the hedges or boundaries of one or more fields, or to paſs through ſome of their angles. All things being determined for theſe ſtations, you muſt take more inner ſtations, and continue to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and ſubdivide till at laſt you come to ſingle fields; repeating the ſame work for the inner ſtations, as for the outer ones, till all be done; and cloſe the work as often as you can, and in as few lines as poſſible. And that you may chooſe ſtations the moſt conveniently, ſo as to cauſe the leaſt labour, let the ſtation lines run as far as you can along ſome hedges, and through as many corners of the fields, and other remarkable points, as you can. And take notice how one field lies by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that you may not miſplace them in the draught.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. An eſtate may be ſo ſituated, that the whole can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſurveyed together; becauſe one part of the eſtate cannot be ſeen from another. In this caſe, you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into three or four parts, and ſurvey the parts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, as if they were lands belonging to different perſons; and at laſt join them together.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As it is neceſſary to protract or lay down your work as you proceed in it, you muſt have a ſcale of a due length to do it by. To get ſuch a ſcale, you muſt meaſure the whole length of the eſtate in chains; then you muſt conſider how many inches long the map is to be; and from theſe you will know how many chains you muſt have in an inch; then make your ſcale, or chooſe one already made, accordingly.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The trees in every hedge row muſt be placed in their proper ſituation, which is ſoon done by the plain table; but may be done by the eye without an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being thus taken by gueſs, in a rough
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0920200400:225"/>draught, they will be exact enough, being only to look at; except it be ſuch as are at any remarkable places, as at the ends of hedges, at ſtiles, gates, &amp;c. and theſe muſt be meaſured. But all this need not be done till the draught is finiſhed. And obſerve in all the hedges, what ſide the gutter or ditch is on, and to whom the fences belong.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. When you have long ſtations, you ought to have a good inſtrument to take angles with, and the plain table may very properly be made uſe of, to take the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmall internal parts, and ſuch as cannot be taken from the main ſtations: as it is a very quick and ready inſtrument.</p>

And let them be as far diſtant from one another as poſſible. Upon theſe places raiſe beacons, or long poles, with flags of different colours flying at them; ſo as to be viſible from all the other ſtations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. At all the places, which you would ſet down in the map, plant long poles with flags at them of ſeveral colours, to diſtinguiſh the places from one another; fixing them upon the tops of church ſteeples, or the tops of houſes, or in the centers of leſſer towns.</p>
                     <p>But you need not have theſe marks at many places at once, as ſuppoſe half a ſcore at a time. For when the angles have been taken, at the two ſtations, to all theſe places, the marks may be moved to new ones; and ſo ſucceſſively to all the places you want. Theſe marks then being ſet up at a convenient number of places, and ſuch as may be ſeen from both ſtations; go to one of theſe ſtations, and with an inſtrument to take
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0920200400:226"/>angles, ſtanding at that ſtation, take all the angles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the other ſtation, and each of theſe marks, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving which is blue, which red, &amp;c. and which hand they lie on; and ſet all down with their colours. Then go to the other ſtation, and take all the angles between the firſt ſtation, and each of the former marks, and ſet them down with the others, each againſt his fellow with the ſame colour. You may, if you can, alſo take the angles at ſome third ſtation, which may ſerve to prove the work, if the three lines interſect in that point, where any mark ſtands. The marks muſt ſtand till the obſervations are finiſhed at both ſtations; and then they muſt be taken down, and ſet up at freſh places. And the ſame operations muſt be performed, at both ſtations, for theſe freſh places; and the like for others. Your inſtrument for taking angles muſt be an exceeding good one, made on purpoſe with teleſcopic ſights; and of three, four, or five feet radius. A circumferentor is reckoned a good inſtrument for this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And though it is not abſolutely neceſſary to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure any diſtance, becauſe any ſtationary line being laid down from any ſcale, all the other lines will be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to it; yet it is better to meaſure ſome of the lines, to aſcertain the diſtances of places in miles; and to know how many geometrical miles there are in any length; and from thence to make a ſcale to meaſure any diſtance in miles. In meaſuring any diſtance, it will not be exact-enough to go along the high roads; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their turnings and windings, and hardly ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> lying in a right line between the ſtations, which muſt cauſe infinite reductions, and create endleſs trouble to make it a right line; for which reaſon it can never be exact. But a better way is to meaſure in a right line with a chain, between ſtation and ſtation, over hills and dales or level fields, and all obſtacles. Only in caſe of water, woods, towns, rocks, banks, &amp;c. where one cannot paſs; ſuch parts of the line muſt be meaſured by the methods of inacceſſible diſtances; and beſides, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for aſcents and deſcents, when we meet with them.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0920200400:227"/>And a good compaſs that ſhews the bearing of the two ſtations, will always direct you to go ſtraight, when you do not ſee the two ſtations; and in your progreſs, if you can go ſtraight, you may take offsets to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable places, likewiſe note the interſection of your ſtationary line with all roads, rivers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And from all your ſtations, and in your whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, be very particular in obſerving ſea coaſts, river mouths, towns, caſtles, houſes, churches, windmills, watermills, trees, rocks, ſands, roads, bridges, fords, ferries, woods, hills, mountains, rills, brooks, parks, beacons, ſluices, floodgates, looks, &amp;c. and in general all things that are remarkable.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After you have done with your firſt and main ſtation lines, which command the whole county; you muſt then take inner ſtations, at ſome places already determined; which will divide the whole into ſeveral partitions: and from theſe ſtations you muſt determine the places of as many of the remaining towns as you can. And if any remain in that part, you muſt take more ſtations, at ſome places already determined; from which you may determine the reſt. And thus we muſt go through all the parts of the county, taking ſtation after ſtation, till we have determined all we want. And in general the ſtation diſtances muſt always paſs through ſuch remarkable points as have been determined before, by the former ſtations.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Laſtly, the poſition of the ſtation line you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or the point of the compaſs it lies on, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by aſtronomical obſervation. Hang up a thread and plummet in the ſun, over ſome part of the ſtation line, and obſerve when the ſhadow runs along that line, and at that moment take the ſun's altitude; then having his declination, and the latitude, the azimuth will be found by ſpherical trigonometry. And the azimuth is the angle the ſtation line makes with the meridian; and therefore a meridian may eaſily be drawn through the map. Or a meridian may be drawn through it by hanging up two threads in a line with the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0920200400:228"/>pole ſtar, when he is juſt north, which may be known from aſtronomical tables. Or thus; obſerve the ſtar Alioth, or that in the rump of the great bear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that next the ſquare; or elſe Caſſiopeia's hip; I ſay, obſerve by a line and plummet when either of theſe ſtars and the pole ſtar come into a perpendicular; and at that time they are due north. Therefore two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular lines being fixed at that moment, towards theſe two ſtars, will give the poſition of the meridian.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IF the ſurvey was taken with a plain table, you have a rough plan of it already on the paper which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the table. But if the ſurvey was with any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, a plan of it is to be drawn from the meaſures that were taken in the ſurvey, and firſt of all a rough plan upon paper.</p>
                     <p>To do this, you muſt have a ſet of proper inſtruments, for laying down both lines and angles, &amp;c. as ſcales of various ſizes, the more of them, and the more accurate, the better; ſcales of chords, protractors, perpendicular and parallel rulers, &amp;c. Diagonal ſcales are beſt for the lines, becauſe they extend to three figures, or chains and links, which are hundredth parts of chains. But in uſing the diagonal ſcale, a pair of compaſſes muſt be employed to take off the lengths of the principal lines very accurately. But a ſcale with a thin edge divided, is much readier for laying down the perpendicular off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets to crooked hedges, and for marking the places of thoſe offsets upon the ſtation line; which is done at only one application of the edge of the ſcale to that line, and then pricking off all at once the diſtances along it. Angles are to be laid down either with a good ſcale of chords, which is perhaps the moſt accurate way; or with a large protractor, which is much readier when many angles are to be laid down at one point, as they are pricked off all at once round the edge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor.</p>
                     <p>Very particular directions for laying down all ſorts of figures cannot be neceſſary in this place, to any perſon who has learned practical geometry, and the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of figures, and the uſe of his inſtruments. It may
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0920200400:231"/>therefore be ſufficient to obſerve, that all lines and angles muſt be laid down on the plan in the ſame order in which they were meaſured in the field, and in which they are written in the field-book; laying down firſt the angles for the poſition of lines, then the lengths of the lines, with the places of the offsets, and then the lengths of the offsets themſelves, all with dry or obſcure lines; then a black line drawn through the extremities of all the offsets, will be the hedge or bounding line of the field, &amp;c. After the principal bounds and lines are laid down, and made to fit or cloſe properly, proceed next to the ſmaller objects, till you have entered every thing that ought to appear in the plan, as houſes, brooks, trees, hills, gates, ſtiles, roads, lanes, mills, bridges, wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The north ſide of a map or plan is commonly placed uppermoſt, and a meridian ſomewhere drawn, with the compaſs or flower-de-luce pointing north. Alſo, in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant part, a ſcale of equal parts or chains muſt be drawn, and the title of the map in conſpicuous characters, and embelliſhed with a compartment. All hills muſt be ſhadowed, to diſtinguiſh them in the map. Colour the hedges with different colours; repreſent hilly grounds by broken hills and valleys; draw ſingle dotted lines for foot-paths, and double ones for horſe or carriage roads. Write the name of each field and remarkable place within it, and, if you chooſe, its content in acres, roods, and perches.</p>
                     <p>In a very large eſtate, or a county, draw vertical and horizontal lines through the map, denoting the ſpaces between them by letters, placed at the top, and bottom, and ſides, for readily finding any field or other object, mentioned in a table.</p>
                     <p>In mapping counties, and eſtates that have uneven grounds of hills and valleys, reduce all oblique lines, meaſured up hill and down hill, to horizontal ſtraight lines, if that was not done during the ſurvey, before they were entered in the field-book, by making a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per allowance to ſhorten them. For which purpoſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0920200400:232"/>there is commonly a ſmall table engraven on ſome of the inſtruments for ſurveying.</p>

Sometimes ſuch pieces as that above, are computed by finding a mean breadth, by dividing the ſum of the offsets by the number of them, accounting that for one of them where the boundary meets the ſtation line, as at A; then multiply the length AB by that mean breadth. Thus:

But in larger pieces, and whole eſtates, conſiſting of many fields, it is the common practice to make a rough plan of the whole, and from it compute the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents quite independent of the meaſures of the lines and angles that were taken in ſurveying. For then new lines are drawn in the fields in the plan, ſo as to divide them into trapeziums and triangles, the baſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars of which are meaſured on the plan by means of the ſeales from which it was drawn, and ſo multiplied together for the contents. In this way the work is very expeditiouſly done, and ſufficiently correct; for ſuch dimenſions are taken, as afford the moſt eaſy method of calculation; and, among a number of parts, thus taken and applied to a ſeale, it is likely that ſome of the parts will be taken a ſmall matter too little, and others too great; ſo that they will, upon the whole, in all probability, very nearly balance one another. After all the fields, and particular parts, are thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

Then if this ſum be equal to the former, or nearly ſo, the work is right; but if the ſums have any conſiderable difference, it is wrong, and they muſt be examined, and recomputed, till they nearly agree.</p>
                     <p>A ſpecimen of dividing into one triangle, or one tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pezium, which will do for moſt ſingle fields, may be ſeen in the examples to the laſt problem; and a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of dividing a large tract into ſeveral ſuch trapezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums and triangles, in prob. VI of chapter II of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying, page 201, where a piece is ſo divided, and its dimenſions taken and ſet down; and again at prob. VI of menſuration of ſurfaces, where the contents of the ſame piece are computed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But the chief ſecret in caſting up, conſiſts in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contents of pieces bounded by curved, or very irregular lines, or in reducing ſuch crooked ſides of fields or boundaries to ſtraight lines, that ſhall incloſe the ſame or equal area with thoſe crooked ſides, and ſo obtain the area of the curved figure by means of the right-lined one, which will commonly be a trapezium. Now this reducing the crooked ſides to ſtraight ones, is very eaſily and accurately performed thus: Apply the ſtraight edge of a thin, clear piece of lanthorn-horn to the crooked line, which is to be reduced, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the ſmall parts cut off from the crooked figure by it, may be equal to thoſe which are taken in: which equality of the parts included and excluded, you will preſently be able to judge of very nicely by a little practice: then with a pencil draw a line by the ſtraight edge of the horn. Do the ſame by the other ſides of the field or figure. So ſhall you have a ſtraight ſided figure equal to the curved one; the content of which, being computed as before directed, will be the content of the curved figure propoſed.</p>
                     <p>Or, inſtead of the ſtraight edge of the horn, a horſe-hair
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0920200400:237"/>may be applied acroſs the crooked ſides in the ſame manner; and the eaſieſt way of uſing the hair, is to ſtring a ſmall ſlender bow with it, either of wire, or cane, or whale-bone, or ſuch like ſlender ſpringy matter; for, the bow keeping it always ſtretched, it can be eaſily and neatly applied with one hand, while the other is at liberty to make two marks by the ſide of it, to draw the ſtraight line by.</p>
                     <p>EXAMPLE.</p>
                     <p>Thus, let it be required to find the contents of the ſame figure as in prob. IX of the laſt chapter, page 207, to a ſcale of 4 chains to an inch.</p>

Then draw the diagonal BD, which, by applying a proper ſcale to it, meaſures 1256. Alſo the perpendicular, or neareſt diſtance, from A to this diagonal, meaſures 456; and the diſtance of C from it, is 428.</p>

Then, with the point of a fine pin or pricker, prick through all the corners of the plan to be copied.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0920200400:239"/>This method is only to be practiſed in plans of ſuch figures as are ſmall and tolerably regular, or bounded by right lines.</p>

                        <p>Another method of copying plans, is by means of ſquares. This is performed by dividing both ends and ſides of the plan, which is to be copied, into any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient number of equal parts, and connecting the correſponding points of diviſion with lines; which will divide the plan into a number of ſmall ſquares. Then divide the paper, upon which the plan is to be copied, into the ſame number of ſquares, each equal to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer when the plan is to be copied of the ſame ſize, but greater or leſs than the others, in the proportion in which the plan is to be increaſed or diminiſhed, when of a different ſize.

                        <p>But the neateſt method of any is this. Procure a copying frame or glaſs, made in this manner; namely, a large ſquare of the beſt window glaſs, ſet in a broad frame of wood, which can be raiſed up to any angle, when the lower ſide of it reſts on a table. Set this frame up to any angle before you, facing a ſtrong light; fix the old plan and clean paper together with ſeveral pins quite around, to keep them together, the clean paper being laid uppermoſt, and upon the face of the plan to be copied. Lay them, with the back of the old plan, upon the glaſs, namely, that part which you intend to begin at to copy firſt; and, by means of the light ſhining through the papers, you will very diſtinctly perceive every line of the plan through the clean pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In this ſtate then trace all the lines on the paper with a pencil. Having drawn that part which covers the glaſs, ſlide another part over the glaſs, and copy it in the ſame manner. And then another part. And ſo on till the whole be copied.</p>
                        <p>Then, take them aſunder, and trace all the pencil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines over with a ſine pen and Indian ink, or with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ink.</p>
                        <p>And thus you may copy the fineſt plan, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring it in the leaſt.</p>
                        <p>When the lines, &amp;c. are copied upon the clean pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or vellum, the next buſineſs is to write ſuch names, remarks, or explanations as may be judged neceſſary; laying down the ſcale for taking the lengths of any parts, a flower-de-luce to point out the direction, and the proper title ornamented with a compartment; and illuſtrating or colouring every part in ſuch manner as ſhall ſeem moſt natural, ſuch as ſhading rivers or brooks with crooked lines, drawing the repreſentations of trees, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Upon the firſt face are three lines, namely, two mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed A, B, for multiplying and dividing; and the third, MD, for malt depth, becauſe it ſerves to gauge malt. The middle one B is upon the ſlider, and is a kind of double line, being marked at both the edges of the ſlider, for applying it to both the lines A and MD. Theſe three lines are all of the ſame radius, or diſtance from 1 to 10, each containing twice the length of the radius. A and B are placed and numbered exactly alike, each beginning at 1, which may be either 1, or 10, or 100, &amp;c. or .1, or .01, or .001, &amp;c. but whatever it is, the

                  <head>OF THE GAUGING OR DIAGONAL ROD.</head>
                  <p>The diagonal rod is a ſquare rule, having four faces; being commonly 4 feet long, and folding together by joints. This inſtrument is uſed both for gauging or meaſuring caſks, and computing their contents, and that from one dimenſion only, namely the diagonal of the caſk, or the length from the middle of the bung-hole
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0920200400:282"/>to the meeting of the head of the caſk with the ſtave oppoſite to the bung; and is the longeſt line that can be drawn within the caſk from the middle of the bung. And, accordingly, on one face of the rule is a ſcale of inches, for meaſuring this diagonal; to which are placed the areas, in ale gallons, of circles to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding diameters, in like manner as the lines on the under ſides of the three ſlides in the ſliding rule.</p>
                  <p>On the oppoſite face are two ſcales of ale and wine gallons, expreſſing the contents of caſks having the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding diagonals. And theſe are the lines which chiefly form the difference between this inſtrument and the ſliding rule; for all their other lines are the ſame, and to be uſed in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>EXAMPLE.</p>
                  <p>The rod being applied within the caſk at the bung-hole, the diagonal was found to be 34.4 inches; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the content in gallons.</p>
                  <p>Now to 34.4 inches correſpond, on the rod, 90¼ ale gallons or 111 wine gallons; the content required.</p>

In the triangle and ſquare, the pile will finiſh in a ſingle ball; but in the rectangle, it will finiſh in a ſingle row of balls, like an edge.</p>
               <p>In triangular and ſquare piles, the number of hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal rows, or courſes, is always equal to the number of balls in one ſide of the bottom row. And in rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular piles, the number of rows is equal to the number of balls in the breadth of the bottom row. Alſo the number in the top row, or edge, is one more than the difference between the length and breadth of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom row.</p>

                  <head>THE USE OF THE TABLE.</head>
                  <p>IN the foregoing table, each number in the column of <hi>area ſeg.</hi> is the area of the circular ſegment whoſe height, or the verſed fine of its half are, is the number immediately on the left of it, in the column of <hi>heights;</hi> the diameter of the circle being 1, and its whole area .785398.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of this table is to find, by it, the area of the ſegment of any other circle, whatever be the diameter. And this is done by firſt dividing the height of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſegment by its own diameter, and the quotient is a decimal to be ſought in the column of heights, and againſt it is the tabular area to be taken out, which is ſimilar to the propoſed ſegment. Then this tabular area being multiplied by the ſquare of the given diameter, will be the area of your ſegment required; becauſe ſimilar areas are to each other as the ſquares of their diameters.</p>
                  <p>EXAMPLE.</p>
                  <p>So if it be required to find the area of a ſegment of a circle, whoſe height is 3¼, the diameter being 50.</p>
                  <p>Here 50) 3.25 (.065 quot. or tab. height, and the tab. ſeg. is .021659 which multiply by 2500 the ſquare of the diam. gives 54.147500 the area required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0920200400:335"/>But, in dividing the given height by the diameter, if the quotient do not terminate in three places of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals without a fractional remainder, then the area for that fractional part ought to be proportioned for, thus: Having found the tabular area anſwering to the firſt three decimals of the quotient, take the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the next following tabular area, which difference multiply by the fractional remaining part of the quotient, and the product will be the correſponding proportional part, to be added to the firſt tabular area.</p>
                  <p>So if the height of a propoſed ſegment were 3⅓, to the diameter 50.</p>
