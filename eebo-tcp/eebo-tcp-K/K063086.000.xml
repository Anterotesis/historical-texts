            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Wickedneſs of the
Times hath been a juſt
Complaint in all Ages,
Paſſion having been ever
powerful and on the ſide
of Vice, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Enemy to Religion. But in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Age, Vice and Scepticiſm join their
Forces to deſtroy Chriſtianity. If Men
were wicked in former Times, their
Wickedneſs was attended with Remorſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0045000600:4"/>
and Shame. But now they are openly
and couragiouſly wicked, being ſo upon
Principle, and endeavouring to ſupport
themſelves by Argument, and by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Example of the Age. Whatever
may occaſion this Growth of Impiety,
the Zeal you at all Times expreſs for
the Church, encourages me to think
your Endeavours will not be wanting to
put a Stop to it: At leaſt, it is to be
hoped, that you will avoid being your
ſelves inſtrumental to the propagating ſo
great an Evil.</p>
            <p>Two Things there are which influence
Men with a Regard for Religion; a
Senſe of its <hi>Truth,</hi> and a Senſe of its
<hi>Uſefulneſs.</hi> The firſt of theſe can affect
thoſe alone who are really Chriſtians:
The latter may have a more extenſive
Influence, and cauſe even Infidels to pay
an outward Reſpect to that whereon
they apprehend the common Welfare to
depend. In proportion as you leſſen ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe Motives, you do a manifeſt
Diſſervice to Religion. But your being
at any Time guilty of Sedition or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
againſt that Sovereign to whom
you have ſworn Allegiance, will very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0045000600:5"/>
much contribute to make both loſe their
Force upon the Minds of Men. For, If
the Chriſtian Religion doth not reſtrain
Men from wicked Actions, ſuch as
Fraud, Violence, Perjury, and the like,
how is it uſeful to Mankind? Or if it
doth, how can you pretend to believe
it, and at the ſame Time act in direct
Oppoſition to its Precepts? And what
Thoughts will other Men be tempted
to have of Religion, when its great
Aſſertors ſhall ſhew themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing of what they aſſert?</p>
            <p>I have neither ſo ill an Opinion of
you, nor ſo good a one of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
as to believe every Thing
which they report to your Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
But as it is now the general
Diſcourſe and Suſpicion, that many of
you, who are bound by the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Oaths to be true and faithful
Subjects to King <hi>George,</hi> do neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
contrary to thoſe Oaths, endeavour
to undermine his Government, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
that of the Perſon whom you
have abjured; I thought it my Duty
to diſſuade you from ſo infamous a
Practice, not with any Intention to fix
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0045000600:6"/>
the Scandal, but to remove the Cauſe
of it, if there be any on your Side;
or, if there be not, to prevent your
being provoked to deſerve it by the
unmerited Cenſures and Reproaches of
your Enemies.</p>
            <p>Thoſe among you, who remain firm
to the Allegiance you have ſworn, cannot
be diſpleaſed that I endeavour to make
others like your ſelves: And if this
Paper fall into the Hands of any who
have betrayed Faith, Honour and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
their own Conſcience will be the
beſt Juſtification for the making it Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
I ſhall, therefore, not as a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician,
who is carrying on a private
Scheme for the Intereſt of any Prince
or Miniſtry, but as a Chriſtian, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
the Advancement and Honour of
Religion, proceed to lay before you the
ill Conſequences, which the Violation of
your Oaths is like to have upon that
Church for whoſe Intereſt you profeſs
ſo great Concern.</p>
            <p>It is plain then, that the publick and
avowed Breach of your Oaths would
prove the greateſt Injury to the Church,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0045000600:7"/>
inaſmuch as it would be deſtructive of
all Religion. If Oaths are no longer
to be eſteemed ſacred, what ſufficient
Reſtraint can be found for the irregular
Inclinations of Men? Common mutual
Faith is the great Support of Society;
and an Oath, as it is the higheſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to keep our Faith inviolate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the great Inſtrument of Juſtice
and Intercourſe between Men. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
therefore, leſſens the Sacredneſs
or Authority of an Oath muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
at the ſame time to be highly
detrimental both to the Church and the
Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Men, by concealing other Crimes, may
prevent the Scandal of them; but the
Perjury of thoſe who ſhould attempt to
ſubvert the Government is an avowed
and open Crime. Other Crimes may
admit of ſome Diminution, either on
Account of the Inconſiderableneſs of
their Object, or the Infirmity which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
the Commiſſion of them: But
this is a Crime of the higheſt Nature,
not only as it affects the Perſon of the
Prince under whoſe Protection we live,
but as it is in a peculiar Manner, above
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0045000600:8"/>
other Crimes, an Inſult on the Deity it
ſelf. State-Perjury doth not ſpring from
a ſudden Guſt of Paſſion; it is no ſenſual
Vice to which you are ſtimulated by the
Frailty of the Fleſh. It is a cool, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
Crime, and ſheweth a ſtedfaſt
Reſolution to do Evil without Regard
either to God or Man.</p>
            <p>It may, indeed, ſeem needleſs to uſe
any more Arguments in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you, either that the Cauſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Religion is likely to ſuffer by the
common Practice of Perjury and Breach
of Faith, or that the Intereſt of the
Church is inſeparable from the Intereſt
of Religion. But I ſhall inſiſt further
on a Point which, how clear ſoever, is
not much attended to. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that the viſible Intereſt of the
Church depends upon her Credit and
Reputation; which Men will be apt to
meaſure by the Reputation of thoſe who
ſtand up moſt zealouſly in her Defence.
If therefore you, who would be thought
true Sons of the Church, and warm Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors
of her Priviledges, ſhould loſe
your own Credit by Perfidiouſneſs and
Perjury, how great a Blemiſh will you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0045000600:9"/>
throw upon her? How muſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſink in
the Opinion of thoſe among us, who
are already <hi>hardly Chriſtians,</hi> when they
ſee the baſeſt Immoralities practiſed to
promote her Intereſt? There are too
many who cannot or will not be at
the Pains to inquire into the Merits of
the Cauſe; but, judging only by Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
will, from the Lives of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
form their Idea of the Church it
ſelf. Conſider therefore what Scandal
you give, and how far you participate
the Guilt of theſe Men, whom you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and harden in their Contempt
of the Church, by making her a Pretext
for Hypocriſy and Prevarication.</p>
            <p>Beſides, you are to reflect that the
Ills of Rebellion are certain, but the
Event doubtful: And conſidering the
Diſadvantages the Rebels muſt lie under,
you ought in Reaſon to apprehend the
worſt. In caſe therefore of a Defeat,
what Quarter are you to expect, I will
not ſay for your ſelves, but for that
Church whoſe Intereſt you pretend to
interweave with your own? One Thing
is evident, that if the Rulers among
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0045000600:10"/>
the Whigs are, what by many of
you they are repreſented to be, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
they will then have the faireſt Pretext,
as well as Opportunity, to deſtroy
her. It may be thought neceſſary to
bind thoſe who call themſelves the
<hi>Church-Party</hi> with ſomething ſtronger
than Oaths.</p>
            <q>Dicta nihil metuere nihil perjuria curant.</q>
            <p>And with the ſame Iniquity that her
Name was uſed to ſanctify the wicked
Actions of her Children, may their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
be then made uſe of in order to
throw an <hi>Odium</hi> upon her. This is <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
ad Hominem,</hi> and ſhould influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thoſe among you who are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to think the worſt of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.
What Thoughts or Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Whigs may have with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Church, I know not:
But I am ſure they give her the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Wounds who diſhonour her by
their. Friendſhip; who would be
thought zealous to promote her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
at the ſame Time that they
deny her Power in their Lives and
Practices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0045000600:11"/>
That which, in the Eye of Reaſon,
gives any Church or Religion the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
above others, is the Influence it
hath upon the Lives of its Profeſſors.
It is upon this foot that the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> ever eſpouſing the Cauſe of
Virtue, Loyalty, and all Things lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in oppoſition to Libertines, Rebels,
and Fanaticks, hath maintain'd her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Eſteem with wiſe Men. And if
we are really concern'd to ſupport her
Honour, the right Way is to put her
Principles in practice, to be true to our
Oaths and Engagements, and live in every
reſpect as becometh peaceable and loyal
Subjects. The Diffenters have been a
long time ſtigmatiz'd for Men of no
Loyalty, not acting upon Principle, but
govern'd by the narrow unſteady Views
of Paſſion and Intereſt. But will not the
Satyr be doubly keen upon our ſelves,
if ever we are found guilty of thoſe
very Things that we ſo heartily condemn
in others?</p>
            <p>It is no eaſy matter to find out Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in ſo plain a Caſe; and yet it can
hardly be ſuppos'd that a Man, who has
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0045000600:12"/>
any Senſe of Religion, ſhould commit
Perjury without ſome Salvo to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
Perhaps you will ſay, that if it
be never lawful for a Subject to break
his Oath of Allegiance to his King, then
the Revolution cannot be juſtified: Or, if
it may ſometimes be allow'd, why not
now as well as then? I anſwer, when
any Perſon, by Forfeiture or Abdication,
loſeth Dominion, He is no longer Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:
Now the Subject ſwore Allegiance
to the Sovereign, and not to the Perſon:
When therefore the Perſon ceaſeth to be
Sovereign, the Allegiance ceaſeth to be
due to him, and the Oath of courſe
to bind. In the Judgment of moſt Men
this was the Caſe at the Revolution. But
nothing like this can be pretended now.
King <hi>George</hi> legally adminiſters that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to which he came with the
joint Conſent and Acclamations of his
People; there being nothing done by
which he is leſs <hi>King</hi> now than he was
at the time you ſwore to him: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
there can be no Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Revolution and the preſent
Caſe. I will not undertake to juſtifie
every thing that is now done in point of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0045000600:13"/>
Policy; but neither will impolitick Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
juſtify Subjects in taking the ſame
Steps they formerly did on the ſcore of
illegal Meaſures. It is one thing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
a State, and another to turn out a
Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould have the Hardineſs to
object, that King <hi>George</hi> is in truth no
rightful King; and that therefore you are
not obliged to pay Obedience to him:
I ask, how you came then to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him and ſwear to him as rightful
<hi>King</hi>? You will ſurely be aſhamed to
own, that in ſo doing you acted againſt
your Opinion; or that ſince that time
your Eyes have been open'd, by the
Diſgrace of Friends, or the Loſs of an
Employment. But though we ſhould
grant that he had originally no Right
to the Crown, yet when a Prince is once
in Poſſeſſion of it, and you have ſworn
Allegiance to him, you are no longer at
liberty to enquire by what unrighteous
ſteps he might have obtain'd it. But
there is nothing of that ſo much as
ſuſpected in the preſent Caſe; it being
known to every body that <hi>King George</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0045000600:14"/>
came to the Crown without Force or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
meerly in Compliance with the
Laws of the Land, and the unanimous
Requeſt of his People.</p>
            <p>To determine the Rights of Princes
is a difficult Point, as requiring more
Skill in the Laws, more Knowledge of
particular Facts, more Leiſure, and more
Underſtanding than moſt Men are Maſters
of. But it is an eaſy matter to know
the Obligation and plain Senſe of an
Oath. You know evidently that you
have ſworn to King <hi>George,</hi> and abjured
the <hi>Pretender,</hi> and that you ought not to
forſwear your ſelf. But, Do you as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
know that Hereditary is prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to Parliamentary Right, and that
the Hereditary Right belongs to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender</hi>?
If you do not, as I am ſure you
cannot, why will you violate the plain
manifeſt Duties of Religion, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of obſerving what is at beſt but
obſcure and dubious? But though the
<hi>Pretender</hi>'s Right to the Crown were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo clear, it would not therefore be a
clear Point that you ought to be aſſiſting
to him. On the contrary, it would be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0045000600:15"/>
clear that you <hi>ought</hi> not, ſince you have
ſworn that you <hi>would</hi> not.</p>
            <p>I muſt repeat to you, that what hath
been ſaid was not done with a Deſign to
ſpread or confirm the Reports of your
Adverſaries; but only to contribute, ſo
far as in me lay, to remove or prevent
any juſt Occaſion of them. Leaſt of all
was it my Intention to inſinuate any thing
diſhonourable of the Clergy, for whoſe
Character I have a high Reſpect, and
whom I verily take to have been injured
by the Reports of warm Men. I ſhall
ſay no more, but leave you to conſider
the Oaths which you have taken.</p>
