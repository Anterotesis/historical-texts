            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>IN this laſt Century there has been no Vice more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally rooted in the Minds of Men than a Diſcordency in Families, and which flows from the very Springs, from which we ſhould naturally expect to find the moſt agreeable Harmony; but Intereſt whoſe Power is invincible, too frequently creates us Enemies where we are moſt nearly and Conſanguinity, which ought moſt eſpecially to endear to each other, is now become a ſtanding Maxim to forget thoſe tender Principles which Nature claims, and the World muſt neceſſarily approve.</p>
               <p>This unfortunate Depravity of Senſe, laid want of frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Affection, was the unhappy Cauſe of many Sufferings and ſevereſt Hardſhips, which a very worthy Youth for many Years endured; and from whom I had a particular Account of a long Series of Miſery occaſioned by his elder Brother, and ſince I have his Permiſſion, will give a ſuccinct Account both of him and his Family.</p>
               <p>This young Gentleman was the ſecond and laſt Son of Mr. <hi>Anthony Elſtone,</hi> born of a very reputable Family in <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and whoſe Father was a wealthy Grazier, worth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0663901100:3"/>
Deal of Money, but having a very large Family to whom he paid an equal regard: He portion'd out his Sons and Daughters alike, often declaring that one Child was as dear to him as another: and that what he was worth was the happy Effects of his own Induſtry, ſo he was determined to diſpoſe it in ſuch a Manner, that no Envy ſhould ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Children from his Partiality, having ten of them, he left to each when died One Thouſand Pounds a piece; and as a farther Proof of his paternal Affection, (his Wife dying when the Youngeſt of his Offspring was but two Years of Age) he reſolved never to make a ſecond Choice, in reſpect to the Memory of a very worthy Woman, and a fond Regard to the infant Blood ſhe left behind her; he look'd on every Child as a particular Bleſſing ſent from Heaven, and as ſuch reſolved never to put it in the Power of a Mother-in-Law to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his pious Purpoſes in acting like a tender Father, or enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating his Iſſue: And conſequently, obliging himſelf to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thoſe he had Part of their natural Rights, to provide for a foreign Stock.</p>
               <p>Many Years before he died he had the Happinneſs of ſeeing even the Youngeſt of his Children diſpoſed of in different Callings, and ſet up for themſelves; amongſt which Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Elſlone,</hi> his Youngeſt, was well eſtabliſhed in Merchandize in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and behaving extreamly well in his Clerkſhip; he married a Niece of his Maſter's, who was a Dependant on her Uncle, who gave her to Mr. <hi>Elſtone,</hi> with a Fortune of Two Thouſand Pounds; and would have done more but that he had a Family of his own to provide for, by this young Gentlewoman he had ſeveral little ones, all of whom died in their Infancy, except the laſt three, <hi>viz. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> the Eldeſt, <hi>George</hi> the ſecond Son, and <hi>Jane</hi> their laſt and only Daughter, who were Twins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>George</hi> were as oppoſite in their Diſpoſitions as Fire and Water, the elder being the firſt that lived up to a Twelvemonth, the fond Parents by an over acted Indulgence,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0663901100:4"/>
ruined his Principles which in Infancy might have been Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated to have rendered him, the reverſe of which be proved, by that Time he was ſix Years of Age he was abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Family, and was paſſed off as Life and Spirit in one ſo Young, very ſoon made him hateful and contemptible to all about him, except his Father and Mother; in about four Years after his Birth their ſecond Son and only Daughter made their Appearance in the World, to the unſpeakable tranſport of their Parents, and the Admiration of all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them, being without Exception, two of the fineſt Children that even were born at one Birth. Young as <hi>Anthony</hi> was he conceived an Averſion for his little Brother and Siſter, and grew jealous at the Sight of them: this rancourous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grew up with him, and ſtrengthened with his Years, the other two whoſe tender Diſpoſitions and Affability of Soul, inclined them to love each other, alſo excited them to ſue for <hi>Anthony'</hi> Affection, but all in vain, he openly declared his Averſion thro' every Action of his Life, and ſeveral Times, even at Play attempting to maim or deſtroy them. This wicked Diſpoſition was once the Occaſion of his Father's ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him ſtark-naked and diſciplin'd him with a Horſewhip till he <hi>had</hi> almoſt left him for dead; it happen'd Mr. <hi>Elſione</hi> luckily went into the Room when he was within an Inch of ruſhing a ſharp Penknife into his Brother's Throat, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enraged the Father and urged him to excuſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Juſtice on him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſanding Mr. <hi>Elſtone</hi>'s Reaſon convienced him of the Juſtice of the Puniſhment he had inflicted, yet when his Anger ſubſided. Fondneſs then prevailed and reduced the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Father to an immoderate Flood of Anguiſh and repene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Tears for having proceeded with ſuch Vigiour to his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling worthleſs Son. Maſter <hi>George</hi> tenderly pleaded for his Brother, and would have prevented the dreadful Stripes he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, but even that wrought no Effect upon the Mind of this young Barbarian; for he remembered the Smart of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0663901100:5"/>
                  <hi>Whip</hi> to a long and cruel Detriment to his Brother's Intereſt and Reputation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Elſtone</hi> had been often heard to declare his Intention of providing for his Family by the worthy Example of his Father, this catch'd the Ears of his Son <hi>Anthony</hi> who from twelve Years of Age to Maturity, induſtriouſly employed his Thoughts to Engroſs the <hi>Whole</hi> of what his <hi>Father</hi> ſhould die poſſeſſed of. To which End he made it his conſtant Buſineſs to influence his Father againſt his Brother <hi>George,</hi> whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Obedience and Regard made it a very difficult Task. For Example: Even in Infancy he was unexceptionably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing to his Parents through a continued Courſe of Good-Nature, at the ſame Time giving promiſing Hopes of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Undertaking, when ripen'd into Years; in his School Days he made his Studies his peculiar Care, and by that Time he arrived to the Age of Sixteen, was Maſter of ſeveral Languages; and as he was deſigned to follow his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Buſineſs cloſely, applied himſelf to the perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Merchants Accompts, of which he is juſtly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be at this Time the compleateſt Maſter in <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Brother <hi>Anthony</hi> was as entirely regardleſs of every Advantage of this Nature, Miſ making chief and Pleaſure his only Study; and having from the Hour of his Birth gain'd ſuch an Aſcendency over the Hearts of both his Parents, they found it an impacticable Scheme ever to get the better of that Power their miſtaken Fondneſs had inveſted him with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Elſtone</hi> was too plainly convinced of the rancourous Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Anthony</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The good <hi>Youth</hi> received his Father's Advice with that dutiful Reſpect that became him, tho' ſorry to be obliged to leave his Father, and greatly affected with

the unnatural and cruel Motive of their Separation. In a ſhort Time Mr. <hi>George</hi> was put Clerk to one Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> an eminent <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Merchant, and ſeldom viſited home above twice or thrice a Year, tho' Mr <hi>Elſtone</hi> often went to ſee him; this Removal any reaſonable Perſon would have thought might have made his <hi>Brother</hi> perfectly eaſy, but ſo far from it, the conſtant Praiſes he heard of his <hi>Brother</hi>'s good Behaviour and Aſſiduity in his Busineſs greatly corroded his Mind, as he knew that this univerſal good Character muſt entirely fruſtrate all his wicked Intents of depriving him of his Birth right, and that any Falſhoods he could alledge againſt him muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove ineffectual; but in order to give Birth to his cruel Purpoſes, he ſuddenly put on a Mask of Friendſhip and feign'd a hearty Repentance for his unnatural Behaviour to his <hi>Brother,</hi> earneſtly requeſting his Father to become his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to poor <hi>George,</hi> and endeavour at his Reconciliation with him. Mr. <hi>Elſtone</hi> and his Wife were pleaſingly amazed at this wonderful and happy Charge in their Son's temper, and without delay ſent for the other home to cloſe this unlucky Breach, and ſix a wiſh'd for Friendſhip between the <hi>Brothers.</hi> Mr. <hi>Elſtene</hi> urged his Son <hi>Anthony</hi> to write, but the artful vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain pretended he ſhould be at a Loſs to Expreſs himſelf in a Manner ſuitable to his Offence, and begged his Father for that Reaſon to do it for him, to which he joyfully agreed as follows:<floatingText type="letter">

As they were happy in the Knowledge of being deſigned for each other, entirely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to their Wiſhes, they paſſed their Time with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Chearfulneſs, and a pleaſing Reflection of being one Day till Death to be rendered inſeparab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Elſtone <hi>being reſolved to expreſs the Fullneſs of his Joy on this Occaſion, concluded his Entertainment with a Ball, and becauſe Miſs</hi> Jenny <hi>would not ſeem particular, choſe her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> George <hi>for a Partner inſtead of young Mr</hi> Hume, <hi>her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Husband. 'Tis true he entreated her to dance with him, but ſhe modeſtly declined it for the formentioned Reaſon, as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are apt to take Notice of every Look and Action of a young Couple ſo near Marriage.</hi>

Accordingly Mr. <hi>George</hi> and his Siſter both of whom danced moſt exceſſively genteel, open'd the Ball with a Minuet and Louvre, and continued Partners for the Night, the whole Company were in a Flow of Spi its and good Humour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the villainous Hypocrite, on whoſe Account theſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured People were all aſſembled; next Day this Monſter of Inhumanity and Falſhood, goes to pay a Viſit at Mr. <hi>Hume</hi>'s under a Pretence of ſtrengthening that Affection he had the Night before wav'd for his injured Brother, he ſtaid ſome Time expatiating on <hi>George</hi>'s kind forgiving Nature, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own miſtaken Folly in being blind to ſo much Merit, and obſtinately depriving himſelf for ſo many Years of his fraternal Love and Friendſhip. During <hi>his</hi> ſtay at Mr. <hi>Hume</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>George Elſlone</hi> was obliged to go out for an Hour upon Buſineſs of very great Conſequence, but made his Brother promiſe to ſtay and paſs the Evening with <hi>them;</hi> to which <hi>he</hi> readily agreed: While Mr. <hi>George</hi> was gone, young Mr. <hi>Hume</hi>'s Fondneſs naturally turn'd his Diſcourſe upon dear Miſs <hi>Jenny,</hi> expreſſing the tendereſt Regard for her, and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs he promiſed to himſelf when he ſhould become her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

Mr. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s preſent Buſineſs was to go and work upon poor Mr <hi>Hume,</hi> whom <hi>he</hi> found ſitting alone in the Compting Houſe reading in a very melancholy Poſture: Why, how now, ſays <hi>Anthony,</hi> why ſo penſive!

Miſs <hi>Elſtone</hi> was under a good dea of Confuſion when ſhe found her Friend not there; but the Lady who received her begged her not to be uneaſy, for Miſs <hi>Edwards</hi> had been there and left her Compliments to her, that ſhe was only gone to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade another young Lady to come, whom nobody but Miſs <hi>Edwards</hi> could prevail on to oblige them with their Company.
