         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>On the diſtance of the Earth from the Sun.</head>
                  <p>IN p. 59. I ſaid, <hi>That the earth is ſituated
thirty millions of leagues from the ſun.</hi> This
was the general opinion of aſtronomers in the
year 1745, when I compoſed the treatiſe on the
formation of the planets. But later obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and particularly thoſe derived from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0195500109:9"/>
tranſit of Venus over the ſun's diſc in 1769,
ſhow that this diſtance of thirty millions ſhould
be augmented three or four millions of leagues.
It is for this reaſon that, in the <hi>Epoques de la
Nature,</hi> I have always reckoned the mean di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the ſun from the earth to be thirty-three
millions of leagues, inſtead of thirty. This
remark was neceſſary to prevent the ſuſpicion
of my having contradicted myſelf.</p>
                  <p>I muſt farther remark, that the ſun is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thirty-three or thirty-four millions of leagues
diſtant from the earth, but, from the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
it has likewiſe been diſcovered that
the volume of the ſun is a tenth part larger
than was formerly ſuppoſed; and, conſequently,
that the whole maſs of the planets is only an
eight hundredth part of that of the ſun, and not
a ſix hundredth and fiftieth part, as I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
from the information we poſſeſſed in the
year 1745. This difference ſtrengthens the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that the matter of the planets was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
from the body of the ſun.</p>

                  <p>I HAD remarked, in p. 65. That <hi>the opaque
bodies of the planets were detached from the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
matter of which the ſun is compoſed.</hi>
Theſe expreſſions are not correct; for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the planets, when projected from the ſun,
was equally luminous as that of the ſun itſelf,
and the planets became not opaque till their
ſtate of fluid brightneſs had ceaſed: The dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this ſtate in ſeveral kinds of matter I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by experiment; and, from analogy, I
calculated the continuation of this bright ſtate
in each of the planets<note n="*" place="bottom">See epoques de la nature.</note>. Beſides, as the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of matter, projected from the body of the
ſun by the comet, traverſed the immenſe atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere
of that luminary, it carried off the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
aqueous, and aerial parts of which the ſeas
and atmoſpheres of the different planets are now
compoſed. Hence we may conclude, that the
matter of the planets is the ſame, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
with that of the ſun, and that there is
no other difference but in the degree of heat,
which is extreme in the ſun, and greater or
ſmaller in the planets, according to the compound
ratio of their thickneſs and denſity.</p>

                  <head>Of the relation between the Denſity of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and their Celerity.</head>
                  <p>IN p. 75. I ſaid, that, <hi>according to this relation
between the celerity and denſity of the planets,
the denſity of the earth ought not to exceed</hi> 206 7/18,
<hi>inſtead of</hi> 400, <hi>which is its real denſity.</hi> The
denſity here aſcribed to the earth is too great with
relation to the quickneſs of its motion round the
ſun, and ought to be a little diminiſhed for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which had formerly eſcaped me. The
moon, which, in this computation, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garded
as forming a part of the earth, is leſs denſe
in the ratio of 702 to 1000, and the lunar globe
is 1/49th of the bulk of the terreſtrial. Hence, if
the moon were as large as the earth, we ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the denſity of the latter 400 in the ratio
of 1000 to 702, which produces 281, <hi>i. e.</hi> 119 of
diminution in the denſity 400. But, as the moon
is only 1/49th part of the bulk of the earth, it
will produce only 119/49, or 2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>/7ths of diminution.
Conſequently, the denſity of our globe, with
relation to its celerity, inſtead of 206 7/18, ought
to be eſtimated at 206 7/18 + 2 7/3 <hi>i. e.</hi> nearly 209.
Beſides, we may ſuppoſe that our globe, at the
beginning, was leſs denſe than it is at preſent,
and that it is become much more compact both
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0195500109:12"/>
by cooling, and by the ſinking of vaſt caverns with
which its interior parts abounded. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
accords with thoſe revolutions which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and ſtill continue to happen, both on the
ſurface of the earth, and even at conſiderable
depths. By the aid of this fact, we are enabled
to explain the poſſibility that the waters of the
ſea were formerly 2000 fathoms above thoſe
parts of the globe which are now inhabited;
for theſe waters would ſtill cover the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the earth, if, by immenſe depreſſions, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts had not ſunk, and formed thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
for the waters which at preſent exiſt.</p>
                  <p>If we ſuppoſe the diameter of the globe to be
2863 leagues, it would be two leagues more
when covered with 2000 fathoms of water.
This difference in the bulk of the earth, produced
by the ſinking of the waters, gives an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a 1/477th part of its denſity. This aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of the denſity, or diminution of the
bulk of the globe, may be doubled, and perhaps
tripled, by the ſinking and overturning of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and the conſequent filling up of valleys;
ſo that, ſince the waters fell upon the earth, its
denſity may be ſuppoſed to have increaſed one
hundredth part.</p>

                  <head>On the relation aſſigned by Newton between the
denſity of the Planets and the degrees of Heat
to which they are expoſed.</head>
                  <p>IN p. 145. I remarked, that, <hi>notwithſtanding
the regard due to the conjectures of Newton, I
cannot help thinking that the denſities of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
have a nearer relation to their celerities
than to the degrees of heat to which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi>
From calculating the action of the ſolar
heat upon the planets, it appears that this heat, in
general, is inconſiderable, and that it has never
produced any great change in the denſity of each
planet; for the action of the ſolar heat, which is
weak in itſelf, has no influence on the denſity of
the matter of which the planets are compoſed,
except at their ſurfaces. It cannot act on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
parts, becauſe it penetrates to a very ſmall
depth only. Hence the total denſity of a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
has no relation to the heat tranſmitted to it
by the ſun.</p>
                  <p>It appears to be certain, therefore, that the
denſity of the planets has no dependence on the
ſolar heat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> on the contrary, that their denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> relation with their celerities,
which laſt increaſe or diminiſh in proportion to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0195500109:14"/>
their diſtances from the ſun. We have ſeen,
that, at the general projection, the more denſe
parts were not removed ſo far from the ſun as
the leſs denſe. Mercury, which is compoſed of
the moſt denſe matter projected from the ſun,
remained in the neighbourhood of that luminary;
while Saturn, which conſiſts of the lighteſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is removed to a great diſtance from the ſun:
And, as the moſt diſtant planets revolve round
the ſun with greater celerity than thoſe that are
nearer, it follows, that their denſity has a direct
relation with their celerity, and ſtill more with
their diſtance from the ſun. The diſtances of
the ſix planets from the ſun are as 4, 7, 10, 15,
52, 95; and their denſities as 2040, 1270, 1000,
730, 292, 184. And, if we ſuppoſe the denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be in the inverſe ratio of the diſtances,
they will be as 2040, 1160, 889½, 660, 210,
159. This laſt relation between their reſpective
denſities is perhaps more juſt than the former;
becauſe it ſeems to be founded on the phyſical
cauſe which muſt have produced the difference
of denſity in each planet.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, though in this article of general geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
I endeavoured to reach that degree of
exactneſs which ſubjects of that nature require;
yet a few ſlight errors have eſcaped me. For
example, 1. I have not uſed the names adopted
or given by the French to ſeveral parts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.
I uniformly followed the Britiſh globes
made by Senex, of two feet diameter, from
which my charts were exactly copied. The
Britiſh are more juſt than the French, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to countries they diſcover, or through which
they travel. They preſerve the original name
of each country, or that which was beſtowed on
it by the firſt diſcoverers. We, on the contrary,
often give French names to the countries we vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,
which is the cauſe of that obſcurity in
the geographical nomenclature of our language.
But, as the lines which traverſe the two Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0195500109:16"/>
in their greateſt length are well marked,
in my charts, by the two extreme points, and
ſeveral other intermediate ones, whoſe names are
generally adopted, no eſſential ambiguity can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from this circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>2. I likewiſe neglected to give the calculation
of the ſurface of the two continents, becauſe it
is eaſily made on a large globe. But, as many
perſons have expreſſed a deſire to ſee this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
I here ſubjoin that which M. Robert
de Vaugondi tranſmitted to me at the time<note n="*" place="bottom">

From this calculation it appears, that, on the left
of the line of partitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, there are 2471092¾ of
ſquare leagues, and 2469687 ſquare leagues on
the right of the ſame line; and conſequently that
the Old Continent conſiſts of about 4940780
ſquare leagues, which is not one fifth part of the
earth's ſurface.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner, the part on the left of
the line of partition in the New Continent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
1069286 5/6 ſquare leagues, and that on the
right of the ſame line conſiſts of 1370926 1/12;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0195500109:18"/>
in all, about 2140213 ſquare leagues; which
makes not one half of the ſurface of the Old
Continent. As both Continents contain but
7080993 ſquare leagues, their ſuperficies is not
near one third of the total ſurface of the globe,
which is about 26 millions of ſquare leagues.</p>
                  <p>3. I ought to have mentioned the ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of inclination that ſubſiſts between the two
lines by which I divided the two Continents. I
contented myſelf with ſaying, that they were both
inclined to the Equator, in oppoſite ſides, about
30 degrees, which is not the preciſe fact; for
that of the Old Continent is a little more than
30 degrees, and that of the New a little leſs.
If I had given this explanation, I ſhould have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
the imputation of having drawn two lines
of unequal lengths, under the ſame angle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two parallels; which would have proved,
as an anonymous critic remarks<note n="*" place="bottom">Lettres à un Americain.</note>, that I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with the elements of geometry.</p>
                  <p>4. I neglected to diſtinguiſh Upper from Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Egypt; ſo that, in p. 137. and 138. there is the
appearance of a contradiction. In the firſt of
theſe paſſages. Egypt ſeems to be ranked among
the moſt ancient lands, while, in the ſecond, it is
reckoned among the moſt recent. I was wrong
in not diſtinguiſhing, as I had elſewhere done,
Upper Egypt, which is a very ancient land, from
Lower Egypt, which is a very new territory.</p>

                  <p>With regard to the figure of Continents, I
ſhall tranſcribe a paſſage from the ingenious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Philoſophical and Political Hiſtory
of the two Indies.</p>
                  <p>'It is now thought to be certain,' he remarks,
'that the ſurface of the New Continent is not
one half of that of the Old. Beſides, in their
figure there are ſome ſtriking analogies.—They
ſeem to form two immenſe bands of earth,
which ariſe from the Arctic pole, terminate in
the South, and ſeparated on the Eaſt and Weſt
by the ocean that inveſts them. Independent
of the ſtructure of theſe two bands, and of the
counterpoiſe or ſymmetry which takes place in
their figure; it is apparent, that their equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium
depends not on their poſition; it is the
fluctuation of the ſea which produces the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the earth. To fix the globe on its baſe, it
was neceſſary to have an element which, by
floating continually around this planet, ſhould
counterbalance, by its weight, the other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and reſtore that equilibrium which the
colliſion of the other elements might have diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
Water, by its fluidity and gravity, is well
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0195500109:20"/>
fitted to ſupport that harmony and that balance
of the different parts of the globe around its
centre.'</p>
                  <p>'If the waters which ſtill moiſten the bowels
of the New Hemiſphere had not deluged its
ſurface, man would ſoon have cut down the
woods, drained the marſhes, and given conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to a watery ſoil.—He would have opened
vents to the winds, and confined the rivers
within their banks; the climate, of courſe,
would have already been changed. But an
uncultivated and thinly inhabited hemiſphere
announces a recent land, while the waters
which environ its coaſts ſtill creep ſilently
through its veins.'</p>
                  <p>On this ſubject I ſhall remark, that, although
there is more water on the ſurface of America
than on that of other countries, we ought not to
conclude from this circumſtance, that an internal
ſea is contained in the bowels of this new land.
We ſhould only infer from this number of lakes,
marſhes, and large rivers, that America has been
peopled long after Aſia, Africa, and Europe,
where the quantity of ſtagnant waters is much
leſs. Beſides, a thouſand other circumſtances
concur in ſhowing, that the Continent of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
in general ought to be regarded as new land,
in which Nature has not had time to acquire all
her powers, nor to exhibit them by a numerous
population.</p>

                  <head>Of the Terra Auſtralis, p. 140.</head>
                  <p>To what I have ſaid concerning the Terra
Auſtralis, I ſhall add, that, within theſe few years,
new attempts have been made to diſcover it, and
that ſome points of it have been found after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
either from the Cape of Good Hope, or
from the Iſle of France; but that theſe new
voyagers have uniformly met with thick fogs,
ſnow, and ice, in the 46th or 47th degree of
South latitude. After converſing with ſome of
theſe voyagers, and collecting all the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I could derive from other ſources, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that they all agreed with regard to this fact,
and that they found ice in much lower latitudes
than is to be met with in the northern hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere.
They likewiſe uniformly met with fogs
in the ſame latitudes where they found ice,
though it was ſummer in theſe climates at the
time the experiments were made. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
extremely probable, that, below the 50th
degree, it will be in vain to ſearch for temperate
countries in the ſouthern hemiſphere, where the
freezing cold is much farther extended than in
the northern. The thick fog is produced by
the preſence or neighbourhood of the ice. This
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0195500109:22"/>
fog conſiſts of minute particles of ſnow, which
are ſuſpended in the air, and render it obſcure:
It often accompanies the great floating maſſes of
ice, and reigns perpetually in frozen regions.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Britiſh have lately ſailed round
New Holland as well as New Zealand. Theſe
ſouthern countries are more extenſive than the
whole of Europe. New Zealand is divided into
ſeveral iſlands; but New Holland ought rather
to be regarded as a part of Aſia, than as an iſland
belonging to the Southern Continent; for New
Holland is only ſeparated from the land of the
Papous, or New Guiney, by a narrow ſtrait, and
the whole Archipelago, which extend ſouthward
from the Philippine iſles, as far as the country of
Arnhem in New Holland, and toward the weſt
and ſouth, as far as Sumatra and Java, appears
to belong as much to the Continent of New Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
as to the ſouthern parts of Aſia.</p>
                  <p>Captain Cook, who ought to be regarded as
the greateſt navigator of this age, and to whom
we are indebted for an infinite number of new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
has not only given a chart of the coaſts
of Zealand and New Holland, but has likewiſe
explored an immenſe tract of the ſouth ſea in
the neighbourhood of America. He departed
from the ſouth point of America on the 30th of
January 1769, and he traverſed a great part of
the ocean under the 60th degree, without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
any land. From Captain Cook's chart
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0195500109:23"/>
we may perceive the great extent of ſea which
he explored; and his tract demonſtrates, that, if
any lands exiſt in this part of the globe, they muſt
be far removed from the Continent of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica;
for New Zealand, which is ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the 35th and 45th degrees, is very diſtant
from America. But it is ſtill to be hoped, that
other navigators, following the tract of Captain
Cook, will traverſe the ſouthern ocean under the
50th degree, and that they will diſcover whether
theſe immenſe regions, which extend more than
two thouſand leagues, conſiſt of land or of ſea.
However, I do not imagine that the ſouthern
regions, beyond the 50th degree, are ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
that any advantage could be derived to us
from the diſcovery of them.</p>

                  <p>With regard to the invention of the Mariner's
Compaſs, I have to add, that, from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Chineſe authors, of which M. le Rouſe

it appears to be certain, that the polarity of the
magnetic needle has been very anciently known
to the inhabitants of China. The figure of theſe

upon a pivot, and whoſe right arm pointed to
the ſouth. The time of this invention, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to certain Chineſe chronicles, was 11 15 years
before the Chriſtian aera, and, according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
2700<note n="*" place="bottom">See l'Extrait des Annales de la China, par Mrs Rouſe and de Guignes.</note>. But, notwithſtanding the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

the Chineſe had ever derived from it the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

                  <p>Homer, in the Odyſſey, tells us, that the
Greeks employed the loadſtone to direct their

and this aera is nearly the ſame with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded

can no longer doubt, that the direction of the

the mariner's compaſs in navigation, were known
to the ancients at leaſt three thouſand years ago.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0195500109:25"/>
'It is confounding,' he remarks, 'Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus
with his ſailors, to think that he could
believe the ſea roſe toward the ſky, and that
they perhaps touched each other on the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
part of the globe.' This criticiſm is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
juſt. I ought to have ſoftened this fact,
which I had extracted from ſome hiſtorical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
for this great navigator, it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
muſt have had very diſtinct notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the figure of the earth, which he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
both from his own voyages, and from thoſe
of the Portugueſe to the Cape of Good Hope
and the Eaſt Indies. It is well known, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that Columbus, when he arrived at the
New Continent, thought himſelf at no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the eaſt coaſts of Aſia. As no man,
at that period, had circumnavigated the world,
he could not know its circumference, and did not
imagine that the earth was ſo extenſive as it has
been demonſtrated by later diſcoveries. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it muſt be acknowledged, that this firſt
navigator toward the weſt, could not fail to be
aſtoniſhed to find, that, when below the Antil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
it was impoſſible for him to gain the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
regions, and that he was continually forced
back. This obſtacle ſtill ſubſiſts. We cannot,
in any ſeaſon, ſail directly from the Antilles to
Guiana; becauſe the currents are extremely ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
and conſtantly run from Guiana to thoſe
iſlands. Ships ſail from Guiana to the Antilles
in five or ſix days; but they require two months
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0195500109:26"/>
to return. In order to return, they are obliged
to make a large circuit toward the Old Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
from whence they direct their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Terra Firma of South America. Theſe
rapid and perpetual currents from Guiana to the
Antilles are ſo violent that they cannot be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
by the aid of the wind; and, as this
circumſtance is unexampled in the Atlantic o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
it is not ſurſpriſing that Columbus, who,
notwithſtanding all the reſources of his genius
and knowledge in the art of navigation, could
not advance toward the ſouthern regions, ſhould
think that ſomething of a very extraordinary
nature exiſted in this place, and perhaps that
there was a greater elevation in this part of the
ſea than in any other; for the currents from
Guiana to the Antilles actually run with as
much rapidity as if they deſcended from a height.</p>
                  <p>The motion of the following rivers, may give
riſe to the currents from Cayenne to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilles.</p>
                  <p>1. The impetuous river of the Amazons,
whoſe mouth is ſeventy leagues broad, and its
direction more to the North than the South.</p>
                  <p>2. The river Ouaſſa is likewiſe rapid, has the
ſame direction, and its mouth is nearly a league
wide.</p>
                  <p>3. The Oyapok is ſtill more rapid than the
Ouaſſa, paſſes through a greater tract of land,
and its mouth is nearly of the ſame dimenſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0195500109:27"/>
4. The Aprouak has nearly the ſame extent
of courſe and of mouth as the Ouaſſa.</p>
                  <p>5. The river Kaw is leſs extenſive both in
its courſe and mouth; but, though it iſſues from
a Savannah about twenty-five or thirty leagues
from the ſea, it is extremely rapid.</p>
                  <p>6. The Oyak, which is a conſiderable river,
divides into two branches at its mouth, and
forms the iſland of Cayenne. This river, at the
diſtance of twenty or twenty-five leagues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
another called Oraput; it is very impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and derives its ſource from a mountain of
rocks, from whence it deſcends in rapid torrents.</p>
                  <p>7. One branch of the Oyak runs, near its
mouth, into the river of Cayenne; and theſe
two rivers, when united, are more than a
league broad; the other branch exceeds not half
a league.</p>
                  <p>8. The river of Kourou, which is very rapid,
and not above half a league wide at the mouth,
without reckoning the Macouſia, which, though
it furniſhes much water, comes from no great
diſtance.</p>
                  <p>9. The Sinamari is an impetuous river; it
comes from a great diſtance, and its bed is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
narrow.</p>
                  <p>10. The river Maroni, though it be very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
comes from a great diſtance. Its mouth is
more than a league broad, and, next to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazon,
it diſcharges the greateſt quantity of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0195500109:28"/>
water. It gives riſe to no iſlands; while the
mouths of the Amazon and Oronoko are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
with a great number.</p>
                  <p>11. The rivers of Surinam, of Barbiché, of
Eſſequebé, and ſome others, till we reach the
Oronoko, which is a very large river.</p>
                  <p>By the accumulations of mud and of earth
brought down from the mountains by theſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
it ſhould appear, all the valleys of this
vaſt continent have been formed; in the middle
of the continent there are ſome mountains, moſt
of which have formerly been volcanoes, and
are not ſufficiently elevated to allow their ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to be covered with ſnow or ice.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is apparent, that the united force of
all theſe rivers gives riſe to that general current
of the ſea from Cayenne, or rather from the
Amazon, to the Antilles; and that this general
current extends, perhaps, above ſixty leagues
from the eaſtern coaſt of Guiana.</p>

thick. This tufa is not commonly of one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
thickneſs. It is frequently cut by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſtrata of ſpurious or clayey marl, of the
<hi>cos</hi> which the workmen call <hi>tripoli,</hi> or of good
marl, and even by ſmall beds of pretty hard
ſtones. . . . . Under this bed of tufa are
found thoſe which furniſh ſtones for building.
Theſe beds vary in thickneſs: At firſt they
exceed not one foot. In ſome diſtricts, three
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0195500109:32"/>
or four of them lie above each other. They
are ſucceded by one of about ten feet, both the
ſurface and interior parts of which are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
with moulds or impreſſions of ſhells.
It is followed by another about four feet,
which reſts upon one from ſeven to eight, or
rather upon two of three or four feet. After
theſe beds, there are ſeveral others, which
together form a maſs of at leaſt three fathoms.
This maſs, after piercing a bed of ſand, is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by clays.'</p>
                  <p>'This bed of ſand is earthy and reddiſh, and
is from two and a half to three feet thick.
After this comes a bed of ſpurious clay of a
blueiſh colour; it is a clayey earth mixed with
ſand; the thickneſs of this bed is about two
feet, and is followed by another of five, which
conſiſts of a ſmooth black clay, the broken
portions of which are nearly as brilliant as jet.
Laſtly, this black clay is ſucceeded by a blue,
which forms a ſtratum from five to ſix feet
thick. In theſe different clays we find pyrites
of a pale yellow colour, and of various fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
. . The water found below all theſe
clays prevented us from penetrating any
deeper.'</p>

for the uncertainties with regard to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

cannot, therefore, be too anxious in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
to obſervers to be more exact in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the nature of thoſe materials they attempt
to deſcribe. They may at leaſt diſtinguiſh
them into vitreſcent and calcareous, as in the
following example.</p>
                  <p>The ſoil of Lorrain is divided into two great
zones: The eaſtern, which covers the chain of
<hi>Voges,</hi> which are primitive mountains, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
entirely of vitrifiable and cryſtalized matters,
as granite, porphyry, jaſper, and quarts, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in detached blocks or groups, and not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
ſtrata or beds. In all this chain of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
there is not the ſmalleſt veſtige of any
marine production; and the hills which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from them conſiſt of vitrifiable ſand.
Where they terminate, and upon a continued
bounding line of their deſcent, the other zone
commences, which is totally calcareous, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0195500109:35"/>
in horizontal beds, and replete, or rather
completely formed, of ſea bodies<note n="*" place="bottom">Note communicated to M. de Buffon, par M. l'Abbó Bexon, March 15th 1777.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The banks and beds of the earth in Peru are
perfectly horizontal, and correſpond ſometimes
at a great diſtance in different mountains, moſt
of which are two or three hundred fathoms
high. They are in general inacceſſible, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as perpendicular as walls, which gives us
an opportunity of perceiving the extremities of
their horizontal ſtrata. When any of them
happens to be round and detached from others,
each bed appears like a very flat cylinder, or a
ſection of a cone of no great height. Theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
beds, placed one above another, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
by their colour and various contours,
often reſemble a regular and artificial ſtructure.
In this country, we ſee the mountains perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
aſſuming the appearance of ancient and
ſumptuous palaces, of chapels, of caſtles, and
of domes. They are ſometimes fortifications
compoſed of long curtins, and defended with
bulwarks. After examining theſe objects, and
the correſpondence of their ſtrata, we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertain a doubt, that the circumjacent land
has not, at ſome period, been really ſunk. It
appears, that thoſe mountains, whoſe baſes were
moſt ſolidly ſupported, remained as monuments
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0195500109:36"/>
to indicate the height which the ſoil of theſe
countries anciently poſſeſſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Bouguer, figure de la Terre, p. 89.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The mountain of Birds, called in Arabic <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliter,</hi>
is ſo equal from top to bottom, for the
ſpace of half a league, that it rather reſembles
a wall regularly built by the hands of man,
than a rock formed in this manner by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Nature. The Nile waſhes this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a long way; and it is diſtant from Cairo in
Upper Egypt four and a half days journey<note n="†" place="bottom">Voyage du P. Vanſleb.</note>.</p>
                  <p>To theſe obſervations, I ſhall add a remark
made by moſt travellers, that, in Arabia, the
ſoil is of various natures. The region neareſt to
Mount Libanus preſents nothing but broken
and overturned rocks, and is called <hi>Arabia Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trea.</hi>
The removal of the ſoil, by the movement
of the waters, has rendered this country almoſt
totally barren; whilſt the lighter mud, and all
the good earth, have been carried to a greater

                  <head>Of the interior Rock of the Globe.</head>
                  <p>In p. 179. I remarked, that <hi>ſolid rocks are
often ſupported by beds of earth, clay, or ſand,
which have much leſs ſpecific gravity. This is
the caſe with moſt hills, and is eaſily perceived.
But, in high mountains, the ſummits are not only
rocks, but theſe rocks are ſupported by others;
and this ſtructure runs through ſuch an extent of
country, where one mountain riſes out of another,
that it is difficult to determine whether they are
founded on earth, or of what nature this earth is.
I have ſeen rocks cut perpendicularly for ſome
hundreds of feet; but theſe rocks reſted upon other
rocks, without my being able to perceive where
they ended. May we not, however, be allowed
to conclude from the leſs to the greater? Since
the rocks of ſmall mountains, the baſes of which
are viſible, reſt upon earths leſs heavy and leſs
ſolid than ſtone, is it not reaſonable to think, that
earth is likewiſe the baſis of high mountains?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I acknowledge that this conjecture, derived
from analogy, is ſufficiently founded. The
conjecture I then hazarded was written thirty-four
years ago. Since that time, I have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ideas and collected facts which convince me,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0195500109:38"/>
that the great mountains compoſed of vitreſcent
materials, and produced by the action of the
primitive fire, are connected immediately with
the interior rock of the globe, which is alſo a
vitreous rock of the ſame kind. Theſe great
mountains are a part of this immenſe rock, and
are only prolongations or eminences formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſurface of the globe at the time of its
conſolidation. Hence we ought to regard them
as conſtituent parts of the original maſs of the
earth. But the hills or ſmaller mountains,
which reſt upon clay or vitrifiable ſand, have
been formed by the motion and ſediments of
the waters, at a time long poſterior to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the great mountains by the primitive
ſire<note n="*" place="bottom">The internal parts of the primitive mountains which I have penetrated, either in pits or in the galleries of mines, to the depth of twelve and fifteen hundred feet, are entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of <hi>pure</hi> vitreous <hi>rock,</hi> in which there are ſlight and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fiſſures, through which the water iſſues, and vitriolic and metallic ſolutions. From this fact we may conclude, that the whole nucleus of theſe mountains is a pure rock, adhering to the primitive maſs of the globe. We indeed find, upon their ſides, and upon the margins of the valleys, maſſes of clayey earth, and banks of calcareous ſtones, at conſiderable depths. But theſe are only the remains of thoſe materials which filled up the cavities of the earth, and muſt be referred to the ſecond epoch of Nature; <hi>Note communicated by M. de Grignon to M. de Buffon, Aug.</hi> 6. 1777.</note>. It is in theſe points or projections which
form the nucleus of mountains, that the veins

are not of the higheſt kind, but of a mean

                  <head>Of the Vitrification of Calcareous Subſtances.</head>

                  <p>I had not then made thoſe experiments which
have ſince convinced me, that calcareous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
like all others, may be reduced to
glaſs. To produce this effect, nothing more is
neceſſary than a fire more violent than that of
our common furnaces. I reduced lime-ſtone to
glaſs by a good burning glaſs. Beſides, M. d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,
an able chymiſt, melted calcareous ſpar,
without the addition of any other matter, by
means of a porcelain furnace belonging to M. le
Compte de Lauragais. But theſe operations
were performed ſeveral years after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my <hi>Theory of the earth.</hi> I knew only
that, in the iron furnaces, the light, white,
ſpungy matter, ſimilar to pumice-ſtone, which
iſſues from them when over-heated, is nothing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0195500109:40"/>
but a vitreous ſubſtance, proceeding from the
calcareous bodies thrown into the furnace to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the fuſion of the iron-ore. The ſole diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the vitrification of calcareous and
vitreſcent ſubſtances is, that the latter are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
vitrified by the action of a violent fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
but calcareous bodies, before they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified,
paſs through a ſtate of calcination, and
form a line. But, like all other ſubſtances, they
vitrify, even in our common furnaces, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they are mixed with vitreſcent matters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
with thoſe which, like the <hi>aubuë,</hi> or
ſlimy earth, yield moſt eaſily to the fire. Hence
we may ſafely conclude, that, in general, every
material of which this globe is compoſed, may
be reduced to its primitive ſtate of glaſs, if a
ſufficient degree of heat is applied.</p>

it only, imagining it to be the production of
ſome learned Italian, who, from mere hiſtorical
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0195500109:42"/>
knowledge, had followed his own prejudices,
without conſulting Nature; and it was not till
after my volume on the Theory of the Earth was
printed, that I knew the letter was written by
M. de Voltaire. I then ſincerely regretted the
expreſſions I had uſed. This truth I thought it
incumbent on me to make public, as well for the
ſake of M. de Voltaire, as for my own and that
of poſterity, to whom I would not leave a doubt
of the high eſteem I have always had for a man
of ſuch uncommon talents, and who has done
ſo much honour to human nature and to the age
in which he lived.</p>
                  <p>As the authority of M. de Voltaire made an
impreſſion upon ſome perſons, others have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to diſcover whether his objection,
with regard to the ſhells found below ground,
has any foundation. Upon this ſubject, I ſhall
ſubjoin an extract of a memoir which was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to me, and which appears to have been
written with that intention.</p>
                  <p>In traverſing the different provinces of France,
and even of Italy, 'I every where ſaw,' le P.
Chabenat remarks, 'figured ſtones; and, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places, their number was ſo great, and
they were arranged in ſuch a manner, that it
was impoſſible not to be ſatisfied, that theſe parts
of the earth had formerly been covered with
the ſea. I ſaw ſhells of every kind, which were
perfectly ſimilar both in figure and ſize to thoſe
which now exiſt. This obſervation was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0195500109:43"/>
to convince me, that all theſe individuals
were of different ages, but of the ſame ſpecies.
I ſaw cornua ammonis from half an inch to
near three fect in diameter. I ſaw cockles of all
ſizes, as well as other bivalves and univalves. I
likewiſe ſaw belemnites,' ſea muſhrooms, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>'The form and number of theſe figured ſtones
prove, in the moſt inconteſtible manner, that
they were formerly animals which exiſted
in the ocean. The ſhells with which the
moulds are covered ſeem to remove every
doubt upon this ſubject; for, in particular ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens,
it is equally luſtrous, freſh, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
as in the living animal. If ſeparated from
the mould or nucleus, we could not believe
that it was petrified. The ſame obſervation is
applicable to many other figured ſtones found
in that beautiful and extenſive plain, which
ſtretches from Montauban to Toulouſe, and
from Toulouſe to Alby, as well as to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent
places. The whole of this vaſt plain
is covered with vegetable ſoil from half a foot
to two feet thick. Below the ſoil there is a bed
of coarſe gravel about two feet in thickneſs.
The gravel is ſucceeded by a bed of fine ſand,
which is nearly of an equal thickneſs; and the
rock lies immediately under this bed of ſand. I
have repeatedly examined the gravel with the
greateſt attention, and I found it interſperſed
with an infinite number of figured ſtones of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0195500109:44"/>
the ſame form, but of various ſizes. I likewiſe
found a number of ſea hedge-hogs, and other
ſtones of a regular figure, and perfectly ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
All theſe facts announce, in language the
moſt expreſſive, that this country, as well as
many others, had formerly been the bottom of
the ſea, which, by ſome ſudden revolution, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

retired, and left its various productions behind.
I ſhall, however, ſuſpend my judgment. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Le P. Chabenat next ſubjoins ſeveral experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove, that the ſhells found in the earth
are the ſame with thoſe which ſtill exiſt in the
ſea. Theſe experiments I ſhall not relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they contain nothing new; and every man
is ſatisfied, that foſſil and marine ſhells are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
of the ſame nature. Le P. Chabenat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his Memoir with remarking, that 'all the
ſhells found in the bowels of the earth are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
real ſhells, and relicks of animals
whoſe element is the ocean, which had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>TO the enumeration I have given of the great
quantities of ſhells found in all parts of the world,
I might add many particular obſervations which
have been communicated to me during theſe laſt
thirty-four years. I have received letters from
the American iſlands, by which I am aſſured, that,
in almoſt all of them, ſhells are found, either pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
or in their natural ſtate, in the interior
parts of the earth, and often below the firſt ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
or vegetable ſoil. In the Malouine iſlands,
M. de Bougainville found ſtones which divided
into thin plates or leaves, and upon which were
impreſſions of foſſil ſhells, of a ſpecies unknown
in theſe ſeas<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage autour du monde, tom. 1. p. 100.</note>. To the ſame purpoſe I have
letters from ſeveral parts of India and of Africa.

Chili which extends from Talca Guano to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
different kinds of ſhells are found in
great numbers, and without any mixture of earth;
and that theſe ſhells are uſed to make lime. He
adds, that this peculiarity would not be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
if theſe ſhells were found only in low

what is ſingular, he remarks, that the ſame heaps
of ſhells are found in the hills at the height of
fifty fathoms above the level of the ſea. I relate
this fact, not becauſe it is ſingular, but becauſe
it correſponds with all the others, and is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>But I can exhibit facts which are ſtill more
obvious. Every man, in his own province, has
only to open his eyes, and he will ſee ſhells in
all places where lime-ſtone is found, as alſo in
moſt clays, though, in general, marine produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are more rare in clays than in calcareous
ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>In the territory of Dunkirk, on the top of
the mountain of the Recollets, near that of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
and at 400 feet above the level of the ſea,
there is a horizontal ſtratum of ſhells, which
are ſo cloſely packed together that moſt of them
are broken. Above this ſtratum, there is a bed
of earth from ſeven to eight feet deep. Theſe
ſhells are ſituated at the diſtance of ſix leagues
from the ſea, and they are of the ſame ſpecies
with thoſe found on its coaſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Mem. pour la ſubdelegation de Dunkerque, relativement à l'Hiſtoire naturelle de ce canton.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0195500109:48"/>
In Mount Gannelon, near Anet, and at ſome
diſtance from Compiegne, there are ſeveral
quarries of excellent lime-ſtone. Between the
different ſtrata of the lime-ſtone we find gravel
mixed with an infinite number of ſea-ſhells, or
portions of ſhells, which are very light and
friable. In the ſame place, there are common
oyſter-ſhells in fine preſervation, and extend
more than a league and a quarter in length. In
one of theſe quarries, there are three ſtrata of
ſhells in different ſtates. In two of theſe ſtrata,
they are ſo much broke, that their ſpecies cannot be
diſtinguiſhed: But, in the third, there are oyſters,
which have ſuffered no alteration, but that of
being exceſſively dried. The nature, figure, and
enamel of the ſhells, are the ſame as in the live
animals. Theſe ſhells have acquired a great
lightneſs, and eaſily exfoliate. The lime-ſtone
quarries are ſituated at the foot of the mountain,
and have a ſmall declivity. In deſcending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the plain, we find oyſters, which are
neither dreid nor have undergone any change,
but have the ſame weight, and the ſame ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
with thoſe which are daily taken out of the
ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">Extrait d'une Lettre de M. Leſchevin à M. de Buffon; <hi>Compiegnie, Oct.</hi> 8. 1772.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the neighbourhood of Paris, theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
ſhells are not leſs common. The marl
pits of Bougival furniſh a kind of middle-ſized
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0195500109:49"/>
oyſters. They are not entire, but cut in
different directions, and finely poliſhed. Near
Belleville, where free-ſtone is quarried, we find
a maſs of ſand in the earth, which contains
branched bodies, which may have been corals
or madrepores converted into ſtone. Theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
bodies are not in the ſand alone, but in the
ſtones, which likewiſe contain ſhells of different
kinds, as volutes, univalves, and bivalves<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. de M. Guettard; <hi>Acad. des Sciences, anneé</hi> 1764, <hi>p.</hi> 492.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Switzerland is not leſs abundant in foſſil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
bodies than France and the other countries
we have mentioned. In Mount Pilate, in the
canton of Lucerne, we find petrified ſea-ſhells,
and the bodies and relicks of fiſhes. In the ſame
mountain, there are corals, and ſlates which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
exfoliate, and, between the leaves, a fiſh is
generally found. Some years ago, the jaws,
and even entire heads of fiſhes, together with
their teeth, were diſcovered<note n="†" place="bottom">Promenade au Mont Pilate; <hi>Journal étranger, mois de Mars,</hi> 1756.</note>.</p>
                  <p>M. Altman remarks, that, in one of the
higheſt parts of the Alps, near Grindelvald,
where the famous glaciers (Gletchers) are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there are fine marble quarries, which he
has repreſented in one of the engravings of
theſe mountains. The marble quarries are only
a few paces diſtant from the glacier. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0195500109:50"/>
is of various colours, as white, yellow, jaſper,
red, and green. The marble is drawn on ſledges
above the ſnow as far as Underſeen, where they
are embarked to be carried to Berne by lake
Thorne, and afterwards by the river Are<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſai de la deſcription des Alpes glaciales, par M. Alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note>.
Thus marble and calcareous ſtones are found,
at great heights, in this part of the Alps.</p>
                  <p>M. Cappeler, in making reſearches on Mount
Grimſel, one of the Alps, has remarked, that
the hills and ſmaller mountains which limit the
valleys, are moſtly compoſed of free-ſtone, of
a grain more or leſs fine and cloſe. The tops
of theſe mountains generally conſiſt of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
of various colours and hardneſs. The
mountains more elevated than theſe calcareous
rocks, are compoſed of granite and other ſtones,
which appear to be of the nature of granite and
of emery. It is in theſe granity ſtones that rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſtal
begins to be formed. But, in the lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
rocks below, we find nothing but ſpar
and calcareous concretions. In general, it has
been remarked, concerning ſhells of every kind,
whether foſſil or petrified, that certain ſpecies
are always found together, and that others are
never met with in theſe places. The ſame thing
happens in the ocean, where particular ſpecies
of teſtaceous animals are conſtantly found toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0195500109:51"/>
in the ſame manner as certain plants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
grow together on the ſurface of the earth<note n="*" place="bottom">Lettres philoſophiques de M. Bourguet, <hi>Biblioth. raiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>née, mois d' Avril, Mai, et Juin,</hi> 1730.</note>.</p>
                  <p>It has been too generally believed, that, there
are no ſhells, or other productions of the ſea,
on the higheſt mountains. It is true, that there
are ſeveral ſummits, and a great number of peaks,
which are entirely compoſed of granite and vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
rocks, and in which no mixture can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Theſe contain neither the moulds of ſhells,
nor the relicks of any marine bodies. But there
is a much greater number of mountains, and
ſome of them very high, where theſe relicks
are to be found. M. Coſta, profeſſor of anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and botany in the univerſity of Perpignan,
in the year 1774, diſcovered, ſome fathoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the top of Mount Nas, ſituated in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Spaniſh Cerdagne, and one of the moſt
elevated parts of the Pyrennees, a great number
of lenticular ſtones, <hi>i. e.</hi> blocks compoſed of
lenticular ſtones, and theſe blocks were of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
figures and different ſizes; the largeſt
might weigh from forty to fifty pounds. He
remarked, that the part of the mountain where
theſe lenticular ſtones were found, ſeemed to
have formerly ſunk; for, in this place, he ſaw
an irregular, oblique depreſſion, very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the horizon; and one of its extremities
reſpected the top, and the other the bottom of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0195500109:52"/>
the mountain. He could not diſtinctly perceive
the dimenſions of this depreſſion, becauſe moſt
of it was covered with ſnow, though it was the
month of Auguſt. The banks of rocks which
ſurrounded theſe lenticular ſtones, as well as
thoſe immediately below, are calcareous for
more than a hundred fathoms. This Mount
Nas, to judge of it by the eye, ſeems to be as
high as Canigou, and preſents no veſtige of a
volcano.</p>
                  <p>A thouſand other examples of marine ſhells,
found in an infinity of places, as well in France
as in different parts of Europe, might be given.
But ſuch an enumeration of particular facts,
which are already too much multiplied, would
ſwell this work, without anſwering any uſeful
purpoſe. From the whole, however, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refrain from drawing this obvious conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that all the inhabited parts of the earth
have formerly, and during a very long courſe
of time, been covered with the waters of the
ocean.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only remark, that theſe ſea-ſhells are
found in different ſtates. Some of them are
petrifactions, or ſtones moulded into the form
of ſhells; and others are in the ſame ſtate as
they ſtill exiſt in the ocean. The quantity of
petriſied ſhells, which are nothing but ſtones
figured by ſhells, is infinitely greater than that
of foſſil ſhells, and they are never found toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0195500109:53"/>
nor even in places contiguous; it is only
in the neighbourhood, and ſome leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the ſea, that we find beds of ſhells
in their natural ſtate, and theſe are commonly
the ſame with thoſe which exiſt in the adjacent
ſeas. Petrified ſhells, on the contrary, are
found, almoſt every where, at great diſtances
from the ſea, and on the higheſt hills, many
ſpecies of which belong not to our ſeas, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of them have no exiſting repreſentatives; ſuch
as thoſe ancient ſpecies we formerly mentioned,
which only exiſted when the globe was much
warmer. Of more than a hundred ſpecies of
cornua ammonis, remarks one of our learned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademicians,
with which we are acquainted, and
which are found in the environs of Paris, of
Rouen, of Dive, of Langres, and of Lyons, as
well as in the Cevernes, in Provence, in Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou,
in Britain, in Spain, and in other countries
of Europe, there is but one ſpecies, called the

<hi>It is probable that the cornu ammonis,
and ſome other ſpecies found only in a petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſtate, belong to the former, and that they
have been impregnated with ſtony matter in the
very places where they are diſcovered. It is alſo
probable, that the ſpecie of ſome animals have
been extinguiſhed, and that theſe ſhells may be
ranked among this number. The extraordinary
foſſil bones found in Siberia, in Canada, in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and ſeveral other places, ſeem to confirm
this conjecture; for no animal has hitherto been
diſcovered to whom bones of ſuch enormous ſize
could poſſibly belong.</hi>

                  <p>Upon this paſſage I have to make two impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
remarks:</p>
                  <p>1. That theſe cornua ammonis, which are ſo
different from each other both in figure and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0195500109:55"/>
ſize, ſeem to form rather a genus than a ſpecies
in the claſs of ſhell animals, are really the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of ſo many ſpecies which have periſhed,
and no longer ſubſiſt. I have ſeen ſome of
them ſo ſmall, that they exceed not a line, and
others ſo large that they were more than three
feet in diameter. Obſervers worthy of credit
have aſſured me, that that they have ſeen ſome
ſtill larger, and particularly one of eight feet in
diameter, and one foot thick. Theſe different
cornua ammonis ſeem to form diſtinct ſpecies.
Some of them are more or leſs fluted. They
are all ſpiral; but they terminate differently,
both at their centres and at their extremities.
Theſe animals, formerly ſo numerous, are no
longer found in any of our ſeas. They are
known to us by their relicks only; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
of their number cannot be better repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
than by an example which I have daily

Our mathematicians who were ſent to Peru, as

height of theſe mountains above the level of the

and others by the barometer, which,
being ſubject to little variation in that climate,
gives the heights nearly as exact as a geometrical
meaſurement. The following are the reſults of

                  <p>By comparing the heights of the mountains
of South America with thoſe of our Continent,
we will perceive that, in general, they are one
fourth part higher than the mountains of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
and that almoſt the whole of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> have been
and actually are volcano's. But even the higheſt
mountains in the interior parts of Europe, Aſia,
and Africa, have been extinguiſhed long beyond
the record of hiſtory. It is true, that, in ſeveral
of theſe laſt mountains, we evidently recogniſe
the ancient exiſtence of volcano's, as well by
the black and burnt ſides of precipices, as by
the nature of the matters which ſurround them,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0195500109:59"/>
and which extend along the ridges of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
But, as theſe mountains are ſituated in the
interior parts of Continents, and now very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

fires, which cannot produce great effects but
by the ſhock of water, ceaſed after the ſeas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.
It is for this reaſon, that, in the Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
whoſe roots may be ſaid to border upon the
South Sea, moſt of the peaks are actual volcano's;
whilſt the volcano's of Auvergne, Vivarais,
Languedoc, Germany, Switzerland, &amp;c. in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
and thoſe of Mount Ararat in Aſia, and of
Mount Atlas in Africa, have long been abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
extinct.</p>
                  <p>The height at which vapours freeze is about
2400 fathoms in the Torrid Zone, and about
1500 in France. The tops of high mountains
ſometimes ſurpaſs this line from 800 to 900
fathoms, and all this ſpace is covered with ſnow
which never melts. The higheſt clouds riſe not
above 300 or 400 fathoms above theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and conſequently exceed the level of the ſea
about 3600 fathoms. Hence, if the mountains
were ſtill higher, we ſhould ſee, in the Torrid
Zone, a belt of ſnow commencing at 2400 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
above the level of the ſea, and terminating
at 3500 or 3600 fathoms, not on account of the

M. de Keralio, a learned philoſopher, has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the heights of the mountains in ſeveral
countries, from the meaſurements of different
perſons.</p>
                  <p>In Greece, M. Bernoulli determined the height
of Mount Olympus to be 1017 fathoms. Hence
the ſnow cannot lie upon it perpetually; neither
can ſnow lie conſtantly on Pelion in Theſſaly,
nor on Cathalylium and Cyllene; becauſe the
height of theſe mountains does not riſe to the
freezing degree. M. Bougner aſſigns 2500 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
as the height of the Peak of Teneriff, the
top of which is always covered with ſnow.
Mount Aetna, the Norwegian Mountains, the
Hemus, the Athos, the Atlas, the Caucaſus, and
ſeveral others, ſuch as Mounts Ararat, Taurus,
and Libanus, are perpetually covered with ſnow,
near their ſummits.</p>

                  <p>In vol. I. p. 240. I remarked, that <hi>the direction
of the great mountains of America is from north to
ſouth, and that thoſe of the Old Continent run
from weſt to eaſt.</hi> This laſt aſſertion requires to
be modified; for though, at firſt ſight, we may
follow the mountains as far as China, by paſſing
from the Pyrennees in Auvergne, to the Alps in
Germany, and in Macedonia, to Caucaſus and
other mountains of Aſia, as far as the Tartarian
ſea; and though Mount Atlas, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
appears to traverſe the Continent of Africa
from weſt to eaſt, the middle of this vaſt penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula
may ſtill conſiſt of a chain of high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ſtretching from Mount Atlas to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Moon, and from theſe to the Cape
of Good Hope: In this view, the middle of the
Continent of Africa may be conſidered as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of mountains which run from north to
ſouth through its whole extent, like the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0195500109:63"/>
of America. Thoſe parts of Mount At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
which traverſe Africa from weſt to eaſt,
ſhould be conſidered as branches only of the
principal chain. The mountains of the Moon,
which run from weſt to eaſt, may likewiſe be
regarded as collateral branches; and, if there are
no volcano's in this prodigious range of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
it may be owing to the vaſt diſtance of
the ſea from the middle regions of Africa;
whilſt, in America, the ſea is very near the foot
of the high mountains, which, inſtead of occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying
the middle of the peninſula of South
America, are all ſituated to the weſt; and the
extenſive low lands are entirely on the eaſt ſide.</p>
                  <p>The great chain of the Cordeliers are not
the only mountains of America which run from
north to ſouth. In the territory of Guiana, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one hundred and fifty leagues from Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,
there is a chain of pretty high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which alſo extends from north to ſouth.
On the Cayenne ſide, this chain is ſo ſteep, that
theſe mountains are almoſt inacceſſible. This
ſteepneſs ſeems to indicate, that, on the other
ſide, the declivity is gentle, and conſiſts of fine
land. The tradition of the country, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or rather the teſtimony of the Spaniards, is,
that, beyond the mountains, there are populous
nations of ſavages united into regular ſocieties.
It is likewiſe ſaid, that there is a gold mine in
theſe mountains, and a lake in which grains of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0195500109:64"/>
gold are found: But this fact requires confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>In Europe, the chain of mountains which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
in Spain, and paſſes through France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
and Hungary, divides into two great
branches, one of which extends into Aſia by
the mountains of Macedonia, Caucaſus, &amp;c.
and the other branch ſtretches from Hungary
into Poland and Ruſſia, and extends as far as
the ſources of the Wolga and Boriſthenes; and,
ſtretching ſtill farther, it joins another chain in
Siberia, and terminates in the north ſea to the
weſt of the river Oby. Theſe chains of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ought to be regarded as one continued
ridge, from which ſeveral large rivers derive
their ſources: Some of theſe rivers, as the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
and the Doura in Spain, the Garonne and
the Loire in France, and the Rhine in Germany,
empty themſelves into the ocean; others, as the
Oder, the Viſtula, and the Niemen, fall into
the Baltic ſea; others, as the Dwina, fall into
the White ſea, and the river Petzora empties
itſelf into the Frozen ſea. On the eaſt ſide, this
chain of mountains gives riſe to the Yeucar and
Ebre in Spain, to the Rhone in France, and to
the Po in Italy, which fall into the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean;
to the Danube and Don, which loſe
themſelves in the Black Sea; and, laſtly, to the
Wolga, which falls into the Caſpian.</p>

Norway is full of rocks and groups of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
There are plains, however, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
without interruption, ſix, eight, and ten
miles. Their direction is not from weſt to eaſt,
like that of the other European mountains. On
the contrary, they ſtretch, like the Cordeliers,
from ſouth to north<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Nat. de Norwege, par Pontoppidan. <hi>Journai étran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In the ſouth of Aſia, from the iſland of Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
to Cape Comorin, there is a chain of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
which ſeparates Malabar from Coroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
traverſes the Mogul country, joins Mount
Caucaſus, ſtretches through the country of the
Calmucks, and terminates in the North Sea to
the eaſt of the Irtis. Another chain extends
from north to ſouth as far as Razatgat in Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,
and may be traced, at ſome diſtance from
the Dead Sea, as far as Jeruſalem: It ſurrounds
the extremity of the Mediterranean, and the
point of the Black Sea, from which it traverſes
Ruſſia, and terminates in the North Sea.</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe remark, that the mountains
of Indoſtan and thoſe of Siam run from ſouth
to north, and both unite with the rocks of Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
and Tartary. Each ſide of theſe mountains
preſents a different ſeaſon: On the weſt, they
have ſix months of rain, while, on the eaſt,
they enjoy the fineſt weather<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. Phil. et Polit. tom. 2. p. 46.</note>.</p>

All the mountains of Switzerland, as thoſe
of the Valleſe and the Griſons, thoſe of Savoy,
Piedmont, and Tirol, from a chain, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
from north to ſouth, as far as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean.
Mount Pelate, which is ſituated
in the centre of Lucerne, nearly in the centre
of Switzerland, forms a chain of about fourteen
leagues, extending from north to ſouth as far
as the canton of Bern.</p>
                  <p>We may, therefore, conclude in general, that
the greateſt eminences of this globe are ſituated
from north to ſouth, and that thoſe which run
in other directions ought to be regarded as col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
branches only of theſe primitive moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
And, it is partly by this diſpoſition of
the primitive mountains, that all the points or
terminations of continents are either ſouth or
north; as appears from the points of Africa, of
America, of California, of Groenland, of Cape
Comorin, of Sumatra, of New Holland, &amp;c.
This fact ſeems to prove, as formerly remarked,
that the waters have proceeded in greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
from the ſouth than from the north pole.</p>
                  <p>If we conſult a new map of the world, in
which are repreſented, round the Arctic Pole,
all the lands of the four quarters of the globe,
except the north point of America, and, round
the Antarctic Pole, all the ſeas, and the ſmall
portions of land to be found in the ſouthern
hemiſphere, we ſhall evidently perceive, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0195500109:67"/>
many more revolutions have happened in the
latter than in the former hemiſphere, and that
the quantity of water has always been, and ſtill
is, much greater there than in our hemiſphere.
Every thing concurs in proving, that the greateſt
inequalities of the globe exiſt in the ſouthern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and that the general direction of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
mountains is from north to ſouth, rather
than from eaſt to weſt, through the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the earth's ſurface.</p>

                  <head>Of the formation of Mountains.</head>
                  <p>ALL the valleys and dales on the ſurface of
the globe, as well as all the mountains and hills,
have originated from two cauſes, namely, fire
and water. When the earth firſt aſſumed its
conſiſtence, a number of inequalities took place
on its ſurface; ſwellings and bliſters aroſe, as
happens in a block of glaſs or of melted metal.
Hence this firſt cauſe produced the original and
the higheſt mountains, which reſt on the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
rock of the earth as their baſe, and below
which, as every where elſe, there muſt have
been vaſt caverns, which ſunk in at different
periods. But, without conſidering this ſecond
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0195500109:68"/>
event, the falling in of the caverns, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that, when the earth firſt conſolidated, it
was every where furrowed with depths and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences,
which were produced ſolely by the
action of cooling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afterwards, when the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were precipitated from the atmoſphere,
which happened when the earth cooled ſo much
as to be unable to repel the vapours, theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
covered the whole ſurface of the globe to
the height of two thouſand fathoms; and, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their long abode upon our continents, the
motion of the tides and that of the currents,
changed the diſpoſition of the primitive moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and valleys. Theſe movements would
form hills in the valleys, and would cover the
bottoms and knaps of the mountains with new
beds of earth; and the currents would produce
furrows or valleys with correſponding angles.
It is to theſe two cauſes, of which the one is
much more ancient than the other, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
external form of the ſurface of the earth is
to be referred. Afterwards, when the ſeas ſunk
down, they produced thoſe ſteep precipices on
the weſt, where they ran with the greateſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
and left gentle declivities on the eaſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſtructure of thoſe eminences which were
formed by the ſediments of the ocean, is very
different from that of thoſe which owe their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin
to the primitive fire. The firſt are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in horizontal beds, and contain an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0195500109:69"/>
number of marine productions. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
on the contrary, are leſs regular in their
ſtructure, and include no marks of ſea-bodies.
Theſe mountains of the firſt and ſecond forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have nothing in common but the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fiſſures; but theſe fiſſures are effected by
two different cauſes. The vitreſcent matters, in
cooling, diminiſhed in ſize, and, of courſe, they
ſplit, and receded to different diſtances. But
thoſe compoſed of calcarious matters tranſported
by the waters, ſplit into fiſſures ſolely by dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>I have often remarked, that, in detached hills,
the firſt effect of the rains is gradually to carry
down from the ſummit the earth and other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which form at the foot a pretty thick ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
of good ſoil, while the top is left entirely
bare. This effect is, and neceſſarily muſt be,
produced by the rains. But a previous cauſe
diſpoſed theſe and ſimilar matters round all hills,
not excepting thoſe which are detached; for,
on one ſide, the earth is uniformly better than
on the other: The hills are always ſteep and
precipitant on one ſide, and have a gentle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
on the other; which proves clearly that
the action, as well as the direction of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the waters, were greater on one ſide
than on the other.</p>

                  <head>Of the Denſity which certain matters acquire by
Fire, as well as by Water.</head>
                  <p>IN p. 246, I ſaid, <hi>that the hard points found
in free-ſtone conſiſted of metallic matter, which
appeared to have been melted by a ſtrong fire.</hi>
This aſſertion ſeems to inſinuate that the great
maſſes of free-ſtone have originated from the
action of the primitive fire. I at firſt imagined
that this matter owed its denſity and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion
of its particles ſolely to the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of water. But I have ſince learned that
the action of fire produces the ſame effect; and
I ſhall relate ſome experiments which at firſt
ſurpriſed me, but which I have repeated ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as to remove every doubt upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <div type="experiments">
                     <head>EXPERIMENTS.</head>
                     <p>I pounded free-ſtones of different degrees of
hardneſs, till they were reduced to a powder
more or leſs fine. Theſe powders I employed
to cover the cements I uſed in converting iron
into ſteel. This powder of free-ſtone was ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over the cement, and heaped up, in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0195500109:71"/>
form of a dome of three or four inches in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
on an earthen veſſel of three feet long by
two broad. After undergoing the action of the
fire in my blaſt furnaces, during ſeveral days
and nights without interruption, it was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the powder of free-ſtone, but a maſs ſo ſolid
that we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>liged to break it in order to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the veſſel which contained the iron, now
converted into ſteel. The action of fire upon
this powder of free-ſtone produced maſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſolid as free-ſtone of a middling quality,
which does not ring under the hammer. This
fact ſhowed that fire, as well as water, could
prove a cement to vitrifiable ſand, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
might have formed thoſe immenſe
maſſes of free-ſtone which compoſe the nucleus
of ſome of our mountains.</p>
                     <p>I am, therefore, fully perſuaded, that all the
vitreſcent matters, of which the interior rock of
the globe, as well as the nuclei of great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
are compoſed, have been produced by
the action of the primitive fire; and that the
waters have only formed thoſe acceſſory ſtrata
which ſurround theſe nuclei, which are all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
and horizontal, or equally inclined, and
in which we find the relicks of ſhells and other
productions of the ocean.</p>
                     <p>In the formation of free-ſtone and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcent
matters, I pretend not to exclude the
intervention of water. On the contrary, I am
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0195500109:72"/>
inclined to believe, that vitrifiable ſand may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
conſiſtence, and unite into maſſes more or
leſs hard, perhaps more eaſily by means of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than by the action of fire. I have related
the above facts ſolely with the view of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
objections which would not fail to be made,
if it had been thought that I attributed the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of free-ſtones, and other bodies compoſed
of vitrifiable ſand, to the intervention of water
alone. It is certain, that all the free-ſtone found
on the ſurface, or at inconſiderable depths, have
been formed by water; for, on the ſurface of
theſe maſſes of free-ſtone, we perceive marks of
undulations and rollings, and ſometimes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of plants and ſhells. But the free-ſtones
formed by the ſediments of water are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diſtinguiſhed from thoſe which have been
produced by fire. The latter have a coarſer
grain, and crumble down more eaſily than free-ſtone
cemented by the intervention of water,
which is more compact, and harder than that
whoſe particles have been united by the action
of fire.</p>
                     <p>Ferruginous matters aſſume a great degree of
hardneſs by fire; for nothing is harder than caſt
iron. But ferruginous bodies may likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
conſiderable denſity by the intervention of
water. Of this fact I was aſcertained by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a quantity of filings of iron into veſſels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the rain. Theſe filings formed a maſs
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0195500109:73"/>
ſo hard, that it could only be broken by the
hammer.</p>
                     <p>The vitreous rock which compoſes the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
maſs of the globe, is harder than common
glaſs. But it is not harder than certain volcanic
lavas, and much ſofter than caſt iron, which,
however, is only glaſs mixed with ferruginous
particles. This great hardneſs of the interior
rock ſhows that it conſiſts of the moſt fixed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of matter, and that, from the time of their
conſolidation, they aſſumed the conſiſtence and
hardneſs which they ſtill poſſeſs. Hence it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be objected to my hypotheſis of general vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification,
that bodies reduced to glaſs by our
furnaces are leſs hard than the rock of the globe;
ſince caſt iron, ſome lavas, or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſalts, and even
certain porcelains, are harder than this rock,
and yet they derive their hardneſs from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fire alone. Beſides, the elements of
iron and other minerals which give hardneſs to
matters liquified by fire, or attenuated by water,
exiſted, as well as the fixed earth, from the
time that the globe was firſt conſolidated: And
I have already remarked, that the interior rock
ought not to be regarded as pure glaſs, ſimilar
to that we make with ſand and ſalts, but as a
vitreous product mixed with matters the moſt
fixed, and moſt capable of ſupporting the great
and long continued action of the primitive fire,
the great effects of which can only be compared
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0195500109:74"/>
in a very diſtant manner with the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
operations of our furnaces; and yet, from
this compariſon, though unfavourable, we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive what effects are common to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
fire and to our furnaces; and it ſhows, at
the ſame time, that the degree of hardneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
leſs on the degree of heat than on the
combination of matters ſubmitted to its action.</p>

                  <p>The beds of calcarious matters are not only
horizontal in the plains, but likewiſe in all
mountains which have not been diſturbed by
earthquakes or other accidental cauſes: And,
when the ſtrata are inclined, the whole moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is likewiſe inclined, and has been forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that poſition by a ſubterraneous exploſion,
or by the ſinking of a part of the earth, which
had ſerved it as a baſis. We may therefore
conclude, in general, that all ſtrata formed by

                  <p>The moſt external part of the earth, whether
in plains or mountains, is ſolely compoſed of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
earth, which owes its origin to ſediments
of the air, of vapours, and of dews, and to the
ſucceſſive deſtruction of herbs, leaves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of decompoſed plants. This firſt ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
every where follows the declivities and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatures
of the earth, and is more or leſs thick
according to particular local circumſtances<note n="*" place="bottom">On the tops of ſome mountains, the ſurface is abſolutely naked, and preſents nothing to the view but pure rock, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, without any vegetation, except in the ſmall fiſſures, where the wind has tranſported ſand, and collected the particles of earth which float in the air. At ſome diſtance from the laſt branch of the Nile, there is a mountain compoſed of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, of prophyry, and of jaſper, which extends more than twenty leagues in length, by perhaps an equal number in breadth. The ſurface of the ſummit of this enormous quarry, we are aſſured, is abſolutely devoid of vegetables, and forms a vaſt deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The vegetable ſtratum is commonly much thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in valleys than on hills; and its formation is
poſterior to that of the primitive ſtrata of the
globe, the moſt ancient and moſt internal of
which have been formed by fire, and the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt external have derived their origin
from matters tranſported and depoſited in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0195500109:76"/>
form of ſediments by the motion of the waters.
Theſe, in general, are horizontal; and it is only
by the action of particular cauſes that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
appear inclined. The beds of calcarious
ſtones are commonly horizontal, or ſlightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined;
and, of all calcarious ſubſtances, the
beds of chalk preſerve their horizontal poſition
moſt exactly. As chalk is only the duſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
calcarious bodies, it has been depoſited
by waters whoſe movements were tranquil, and
their oſcillations regular; whilſt the matters
which were only broken into large maſſes, have
been tranſported by currents, and depoſited by
the removal of the waters; which is the reaſon
why their ſtrata are not ſo perfectly horizontal
as thoſe of chalk. The high coaſts of Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are compoſed of horizontal ſtrata of chalk ſo
regularly perpendicular, that, at a diſtance, they
have the appearance of fortified walls. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſtrata of chalk there are ſmall beds of
black flint, which give riſe to the black veins in
white marble.</p>
                  <p>Beſide the calcarious ſhells, the ſtrata of which
are ſlightly inclined, and whoſe poſition has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

have been deranged by different accidents, and
which are all much inclined. Of theſe there
are many examples in various parts of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennees,
ſome of which are inclined forty-five,
fifty, and even ſixty degrees below the horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

                  <head>Of the Peaks of Mountains.</head>
                  <p>I endeavoured to explain, Vol. I. p. 247. how
the peaks of mountains had been deprived of the
vitrifiable ſands with which they had been ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
inveſted; and my explanation errs in
this circumſtance only, that I attributed the firſt
formation of the rocks which form the nuclei
of theſe peaks to the intervention of water, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of aſcribing it to the action of fire. Theſe
peaks or horns of mountains are nothing but
prolongations of the interior rock of the globe,
which were environed with great quantities of
ſcoriae and duſt of glaſs. Theſe looſe materials
muſt have been carried down by the movement
of the ſea, when it made its retreat. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the rains and torrents of water would
ſoon deprive the maſſes of pure rock of all their
coverings, and make them completely bare,
as they are at preſent. I may remark, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that no other change falls to be made in my
theory of the earth than the following fact,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0195500109:78"/>
that the firſt mountains derived their origin from
the primitive fire, and not from the intervention
of water, as I had conjectured; becauſe I had
then been induced to believe, by the authority
of Woodward and ſome other naturaliſts, that
ſhells were found on the tops of all mountains.
But, from more recent obſervations, it appears,
that there are no ſhells on the higheſt ſummits,
nor above two thouſand fathoms above the level
of the ſea. Hence the waters have never ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
thoſe high ſummits, or at leaſt have
remained but a ſhort time upon them; ſo that
they have formed only the hills and the calcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mountains, which never riſe to the height
of two thouſand fathoms.</p>

Waters.</head>
                  <p>PAGE 266. Concerning the theory of running
waters, I have to add a new obſervation
which I made ſince I eſtabliſhed mills, by
which the different celerities of water may be
pretty accurately aſcertained. Theſe mills are
compoſed of nine wheels, ſome of which are
impelled by a fall of water of two or three feet,
and others by a fall of five or ſix feet high: I
was at firſt ſurpriſed to find, that all the
wheels turned more quickly in the night than
in the day, and that the difference was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in proportion to the height and breadth
of the column of water. For example, if the
water falls ſix feet, the wheel will turn a
tenth, and ſometimes a ninth quicker in the
night than in the day; and, if the fall is leſs
high, the difference of celerity will likewiſe be
leſs; but it is always ſo ſenſible as to be eaſily
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0195500109:80"/>
recogniſed. I aſcertained this fact by placing
white marks upon the wheels, and reckoning
the number of revolutions in equal times, both
during the day and the night; and I uniformly
found, by a great number of obſervations, that
the time when the wheels moved with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
celerity was the coldeſt hour of the night,
and that they moved ſloweſt when the heat of
the day was greateſt. In the ſame manner, I
afterwards found, that the celerity of all the
wheels is greater in winter than in ſummer.
Theſe facts, which have eſcaped the obſervation
of philoſophers, are of importance in practice.
The theory of them is extremely ſimple: This
augmentation of celerity depends ſolely on the
denſity of the water, which is increaſed by cold
and diminiſhed by heat: And, as the ſame vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of water only can paſs by the trough, this
volume, which is denſer in winter and during
the night, than in ſummer or in the day, acts
with more force on the wheel, and, of courſe,
communicates to it a greater quantity of motion.
Thus, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> there will be leſs loſs of
water, if we ſtop the machines during the heat
of the day, and work them during the night. By
obſerving this method in my forges, its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the proceſs of making iron amounted to
one twelfth part.</p>
                  <p>Another obſervation merits attention: Of two
wheels, the one nearer the canal than the other,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0195500109:81"/>
but perfectly equal in every other reſpect, and
both moved by an equal quantity of water, the
wheel neareſt the canal moves quicker than the
one more remote, and to which the water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
arrive till after it has run over a certain
ſpace in the particular runner that terminates in
this wheel. It is well known, that the friction
of water on the ſides of a canal diminiſhes its
celerity. But this circumſtance is not ſufficient
to account for the conſiderable difference in the
motion of theſe two wheels. It is owing, in the
<hi>firſt</hi> place, to the water in this canal not being
preſſed laterally, as it is when it enters by the
trough of the canal, and to its ſtriking immediately
the ladles of the wheel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of motion, depending on the diſtance of the
wheels from the canal, is likewiſe owing to the
water, which paſſes through a trough, not being a
column of equal dimenſions with the trough; for
the water, in its paſſage, forms an irregular cone,
which is depreſſed on the ſides in proportion to
the breadth of the volume of water in the canal.
If the ladles of the wheel are very near the trough,
the water acts very near as high as the aperture
of the trough: But, if the wheel is more diſtant
from the canal, the water ſinks in the runner, and
ſtrikes not the ladles of the wheel at the ſame
height, nor with equal celerity, as in the firſt
caſe. The union of theſe two cauſes produces
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0195500109:82"/>
that diminution of celerity in wheels which are
diſtant from the canal.</p>

                  <head>Of the ſaltneſs of the Sea, p. 275.</head>
                  <p>ON this ſubject there are two opinions, and
both of them are partly true. Halley attributes
the ſaltneſs of the ſea ſolely to the ſalts of the
earth carried down by the rivers; and even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
that the antiquity of the world may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by the degree of ſaltneſs in the waters
of the ocean. Leibnitz, on the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
that the globe having been liquified by
fire, the ſals and other empyreumatic ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
produced with the aqueous vapours a ſalt
lixivium, and, conſequently, that the ſea received
its ſaltneſs from the beginning. The opinions
of theſe two great philoſophers, though oppoſite,
ſhould be united, and may even coincide with my
own. It is extremely probable, that, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the action of fire combined with that of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſſolved all the ſaline ſubſtances on the ſurface
of the earth; and, of courſe, that the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſaltneſs in the ſea proceeded from the
cauſe aſſigned by Leibnitz; but this prevents not
the ſecond cauſe aſſigned by Halley from having
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0195500109:83"/>
conſiderable influence upon the actual degree of
ſaltneſs in the ſea, which muſt always augment,
becauſe the rivers inceſſantly carry down great
quantities of fixed ſalts, which cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
by evaporation. They remain, therefore,
mixed with the general maſs of waters, which
are, in general, more ſalt in proportion to their
diſtance from the mouths of rivers, and where
the heat of the climate produces the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporation.
That the ſecond cauſe acts more
powerfully than perhaps the firſt, is proved by
this circumſtance, that all lakes from which rivers
iſſue are not ſalt, but almoſt all thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
rivers and diſcharge none, are impregnated
with ſalt. The Caſpian Sea, Lake Aral, the Dead
Sea, &amp;c. owe their ſaltneſs ſolely to the ſalts
tranſported thither by the rivers, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be carried off by evaporation.</p>

                  <head>Of the Limits of the South Sea.</head>
                  <p>THE South Sea is much broader than the
Atlantic, and appears to be bounded by
two chains of mountains, which correſpond as
far as the Equator. The firſt chain is compoſed
of the mountains of California, of New Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,
of the Iſthmus of Panama, of the Cordeliers,
of Peru, of Chili, &amp;c. The other chain ſtretches
through Kamtſchatka, Yeſſo, and Japan, and
extends as far as the Larron iſlands, and even the
New Philippines. The direction of theſe chains
of mountains, which appear to be the ancient
limits of the Pacific Ocean, is preciſely from
north to ſouth; ſo that the Old Continent was
bounded on the eaſt by one of theſe chains
of mountains, and the New Continent by the
other. Their ſeparation happened at the period
when the waters, proceeding from the ſouth
pole, began to run between theſe two chains
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0195500109:86"/>
of mountains, which ſeem to unite, or at leaſt
to make a very near approach to each other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the northern regions. This is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indication of the ancient union of the two
continents on the north. This continuity of
the two continents between Kamtſchatka and the
moſt weſtern land of America, ſeems now to
be proved by the new diſcoveries of navigators,
who have found, under the ſame parallel of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
a great number of iſlands lying ſo near each

                  <p>I HAD too generally and two poſitively aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, in no part of the ſea, a ſuperior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
current are to be found.</p>
                  <p>I have ſince received information, which ſeems
to prove, that this effect actually exiſts, and can
even be demonſtrated, in certain parts of the
ſea. On this ſubject, M. Deſlandes, an able na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator,
obligingly communicated to me the
following accurate remarks, in two letters, the

have been deceived by the regorging of the
water near the ſhores, which often produces a
motion oppoſite to that of the principal current.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>'After reading this paſſage, I determined to
tranſmit you my obſervations on the ſubject.'</p>
                  <p>'Two months after my departure from
France, I reconnoitered the land between
Capes Gonſalvas and Saint Catharine. The
force of the currents, the direction of which is
to the north north-weſt, correſponding exactly
with the ſituation of the lands, obliged me to
caſt anchor. The general winds of this region
blow from the ſouth ſouth-eaſt, ſouth ſouth-weſt,
and ſouth-weſt. I ſpent two months
and a half in making fruitleſs attempts to
change my ſituation, and to reach the coaſt of
Loango, where I had ſome buſineſs to tranſact.
During this time, I remarked, that the ſea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
in the above direction from half a
league to a league in the hour, and that, at
certain depths, the currents aſcended below
with the ſame rapidity as they deſcended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0195500109:88"/>
'I aſcertained the depth of theſe oppoſite cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in the following manner. Being moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in eight fathoms water, and the ſea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
clear, I fixed a lead of thirty pounds
weight to the end of a line. At about two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
from the lead, I tied a table napkin to
the line by one of its corners, and allowed the
lead to ſink in the water. As ſoon as the table
napkin entered, it took the direction of the
firſt current. Continuing to obſerve it, I made
it deſcend. Whenever I perceived that the
current diſcontinued, I ſtopped. It then float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
indifferently around the line. In this place,
therefore, the run was interrupted. I then
ſunk the table napkin about a foot lower,
and it aſſumed an oppoſite direction. By
marking the line at the ſurface of the water,
I found that the table napkin was at the depth
of three fathoms; from which I concluded, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
different examinations, that, of eight fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
water, three ran north north-weſt, and
five ran in the contrary direction of ſouth
ſouth-eaſt.'</p>
                  <p>'The ſame day, I repeated the experiment
in fifty fathoms water, being then diſtant from
the land ſix or ſeven leagues. I was ſurpriſed
to find that the upper current was deeper in
proportion to the depth of the bottom. Of
fifty fathoms water, I reckoned that from
twelve to fifteen ran in the firſt direction. This
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0195500109:89"/>
phaenomenon did not take place during the
whole two months and a half that I remained
on this coaſt, but nearly one month only, and
at different times; during theſe interruptions
the whole water ran into the gulf of Guiney.'</p>
                  <p>'This oppoſition of currents ſuggeſted the
idea of a machine, which, being ſunk as
far as the inferior current, and preſenting a
great ſurface, might force my veſſel againſt
the ſuperior current, I made the experiment
in miniature upon a boat; and I proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo far as to produce an equilibrium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the force of the ſuperior current, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that of the wind, upon the boat, and
the force of the inferior current upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine.
I had not an opportunity of making
trials on a larger ſcale. What I have related,
Sir, is a truth which may be confirmed by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
navigator who has viſited theſe climates.'</p>
                  <p>'I imagine that the winds, as well as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
which diſcharge themſelves into the ſea
along this coaſt, and carry great quantities of
earth into the gulf of Guiney, are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
cauſes of theſe effects. Beſides, the bottom
of this gulf, which, by its declivity, obliges the
tide to run retrograde whenever it arrives at a
certain level, and is inceſſantly preſſed by freſh
quanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies, while the wind acts in a contrary
direction upon the ſurface, and conſtrains part
of the water to obſerve its ordinary courſe.
This ſeems to be the more probable, becauſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0195500109:90"/>
the ſea enters from all quarters into this gulf,
and iſſues only by revolutions which ſeldom
happen. The moon has no apparent effect;
for the ſame thing takes place during all its
phaſes.'</p>
                  <p>'I had occaſion to be ſtill farther convinced
that the preſſure of the water, when it comes
to its level, joined to the inclination of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
are the ſole cauſes of this phaenomenon.
I found, that theſe currents exiſt only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the ſmaller or greater declivity of
the ſhores; and I have every reaſon to believe,
that they are not perceived beyond twelve or
fifteen leagues from land, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſtance along the coaſt of Angola, where
we can be certain of finding the bottom. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'The following circumſtances ſeem to prove,
that ſimilar changes in the currents take place
in the open ſea. I made one of my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at a mean depth, namely thirty-five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.
I found, at the depth of ſix or ſeven
fathoms, that the courſe of the water ran
north north-weſt. On ſinking two or three
fathoms more, my line ſtretched to the weſt
north-weſt. At three or four fathoms deeper,
the courſe was weſt ſouth-weſt, then ſouth-weſt,
and ſouth. Laſtly, at twenty-five and
twenty-ſix fathoms, the courſe was ſouth
ſouth-eaſt, and towards the bottom it was
ſouth-eaſt and eaſt ſouth-eaſt. From theſe
experiments I drew the following concluſions:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0195500109:91"/>
That I might compare the ocean between A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica
and America to a great river, the courſe
of which is almoſt conſtantly directed to the
north-weſt; that, as it runs along, it carries
down ſand and mud, which it depoſits on its
banks. Theſe banks are, of courſe, heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and neceſſarily raiſe the level of the water,
and oblige it to run ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ograde in proportion
to the declivity of the ſhore. But, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is directed by a primitive impulſe, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
return in a ſtraight line: Obeying the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
movement, and yielding reluctantly to
the laſt obſtacle, it muſt neceſſarily deſcribe a
curve of greater or ſmaller extent, till it meets
the middle current with which it may partly
unite, or which may ſerve it as a fulcrum, and
give it a direction contrary to that impreſſed
on it by the bottom. As the maſs of water is
in perpetual motion, the water towards the
bottom, being nearer the cauſe and more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
muſt always undergo the firſt changes,
and run in a direction contrary to the ſuperior
current, while the ſame cauſe reaches not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
heights. Theſe, Sir, are my ideas.
I have frequently taken advantage of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
currents; by ſinking a machine to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
depths, according to the number of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
water I happened to be in, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to ſail againſt the upper current. I
found, that, in calm water, and with a ſurface
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0195500109:92"/>
three times larger than that part of the prow
which is below the water, we could run from
a third to half a league in the hour. Of this
fact I was aſcertained by my latitude, by boats
which I anchored, and from which I found
myſelf at a great diſtance an hour afterward;
and, laſtly, by the diſtance of certain points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the coaſts.'</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſervations of M. Deſlandes ſeem to
be deciſive, and I accede to them with pleaſure.
I cannot ſufficiently thank him for demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
not only that my ideas on this ſubject were,
in general, juſt, but that, in particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
they were liable to exceptions. It is
not leſs certain, however, that the ocean forced
open the ſtrait of Gibraltar, and, conſequently,
that the Mediterranean ſea received a great aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
by this irruption. I reſted this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
not only on the current of the ocean into
the Mediterranean, but on the ſituation of the
land and the correſpondence of the ſtrata on the
oppoſite coaſts, which has often been remarked
by intelligent navigators. 'The irruption which
formed the Mediterranean is evident, as well
as that of the Black Sea by the ſtrait of the
Dardanelles, where the current is always vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and the correſpondence of the angles of
the two coaſts ſtrongly marked, as well as the
ſimilarity of the ſtrata, which are preciſely the

ſea falls back from the Poles towards the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

                  <p>This obſervation, joined to that of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding

movement of the waters of the ocean from the

                  <p>In Hudſon's bay, veſſels have to preſerve
themſelves from mountains of ice, which are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0195500109:94"/>
ſaid to be from fifteen to eighteen hundred feet
thick, and which, being formed by a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of long winters, in ſmall gulfs perpetually

                  <p>The north-weſt wind, which prevails perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
during winter, and often in ſummer,
excites, in the ſame bay, dreadful tempeſts.
Theſe are ſtill more to be apprehended, becauſe
ſhoals are here very frequent. In the countries
which bound this bay, the ſun never riſes nor
ſets without a great cone of light. When this
phaenomenon diſappears, it is ſucceeded by the
aurora borealis. Here the heavens are ſeldom
ſerene. In ſpring and autumn the air is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
replete with thick fogs; and, during win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with an infinity of ſmall threads of ice,
which are viſible to the eye. Though the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

                  <p>The ſea along the coaſts of Norway, which

                  <p>Some obſervations have lately been made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
temperature of the land and water in
the climates adjacent to the north Pole.</p>
                  <p>'In Greenland, the cold begins with the new
year, and becomes ſo piercing in the months
of February and March, that the ſtones ſplit,
and the ſea ſmokes like a furnace, eſpecially in
the bays. In the midſt of this thick fog,
however, the froſt is not ſo intenſe, as when
the ſky is unclouded; for, when we paſs from
the land to that foggy atmoſphere which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the ſurface and margins of the waters,
we feel a milder air, though our hair and
clothes are ſtiffened with hoar-froſt. This fog
produces more chilblains than a dry cold; and,
when it paſſes from the ſea to a colder atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere,
it inſtantly freezes, is diſperſed through
the horizon by the wind, and produces a cold
ſo intenſe that no perſon can go into the open
air, without running the hazard of having his
hands and feet entirely frozen. It is in this
ſeaſon, that we ſee the water freeze on the fire
before it boils. It is then that the winter
paves a road of ice between iſlands, and in the
bays and ſtraits.'</p>
                  <p>'Autumn is the fineſt ſeaſon in Greenland.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0195500109:96"/>
But its duration is ſhort, and frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by cold froſty nights. It is alſo about
this time, that, in an atmoſphere darkened
with vapours, we ſee fogs which freeze and
form a tiſſue on the ſea ſimilar to cobwebs;
and, in the fields, the air is impregnated with lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
atoms, or ſharp icicles like ſmall needles.'</p>
                  <p>'It has often been remarked, that the ſeaſons
in Greenland aſſume a temperature oppoſite to
that which prevails in the reſt of Europe.
When the winter is rigorous in the temperate
climates, it is mild in Greenland, and very
ſevere in this northern region, when it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
in our countries. At the end of the
year 1739, he winter was ſo mild in the bay
of Diſko, that the gueeſe, in the month of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,
paſſed from the temperate to the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
zone in queſt of warmer air; and that, in
1740, no ice was ſeen at Diſko in the month
of March; while, in Europe, the ice prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without interruption, from October to
May. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'In winter 1763, which was extremely cold
over all Europe, the cold was ſo little felt in
Greenland, that ſome ſummers have been leſs
mild<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 20. &amp;c.</note>.''</p>
                  <p>We are aſſured by voyagers, that, in the ſeas
adjacent to Greenland, there are very high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of floating ice, and others which reſemble
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0195500109:97"/>
rafts of two hundred fathoms in length, by ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or eighty in breadth. But theſe boards of ice,
which form immenſe plains upon the ſea, are
ſeldom above nine or twelve feet thick. They
ſeem to be formed immediately on the ſurface
when the cold is greateſt. But the floating and
very high maſſes come from the land, <hi>i. e.</hi> from
the environs of mountains and coaſts, from
which they have been detached and carried
down to the ſea by the rivers. Theſe maſſes of
ice bring along with them great quantities of
wood, which are afterwards thrown by the ſea
upon the eaſtern coaſts of Greenland. This
wood, it appears, neither comes from Labrador
nor Norway; becauſe the north-eaſt winds,
which are very violent in theſe countries, would
puſh back the trees, and the currents which run
to the ſouth of Davis's ſtrait, and Hudſon's bay,
would ſtop all that might come from America
to the coaſts of Greenland.</p>
                  <p>The ſea begins to carry boards of ice to Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen
in the months of April and May. A
great number come from Davis's ſtrait, part of
them from Nova Zembla, and the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
from the eaſt coaſt of Greenland, being
tranſported from eaſt to weſt according to the
general movement of the ocean.</p>
                  <p>The following facts and notices are to be
found in the voyage of Captain Phipps. 'The
idea of a paſſage to the Eaſt Indies by the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0195500109:98"/>
North Pole was ſuggeſted as early as the year
1527, by Robert Thorne, merchant of Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol. . . . .'
No voyage, however, appears to
have been undertaken to explore the circumpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſeas, till the year 1607, when 'Henry Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was ſet forth, at the charge of certain wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful
merchants of London, to diſcover a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
by the North Pole to Japan and China.
. . And this I can aſſure at this preſent, that
between ſeventy-eight degrees and a half, and
eighty-two degrees, by this way there is no
paſſage.'</p>
                  <p>'In 1609, a voyage was ſet forth by the
Right Worſhipful Sir Thomas Smith to the
ſouth part of Spitzbergen; and, when near
Foreland, he ſent his mate aſhore; and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the account he gave at his return, ſays,
Moreover, I was certified that all the ponds
and lakes were unfrozen, they being freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which putteth me in hope of a mild ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
here, after ſo ſharp a beginning as I have
had; and my opinion is ſuch, and I aſſure
myſelf it is ſo, that a paſſage may be as ſoon
attained this way by the Pole, as any unknown
way whatſoever, by reaſon the ſun doth give
a great heat in this climate, and the ice (I
mean that freezeth here) is nothing ſo huge as
I have ſeen in ſeventy-three degrees. . . .' Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other voyagers have attempted to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this paſſage, but without ſucceſs.'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0195500109:99"/>
On the fifth of July, Captain Phipps ſaw great
quantities of floating ice about the 79° 34′ of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
The weather was foggy. The next
day he continued his courſe as far as the 79° 59′
39″ between Spitzbergen and the ice. On the
7th, he proceeded through the floating maſſes of
ice in queſt of an open paſſage to the north
by which he might gain an open ſea. But the ice
to the north-north-weſt formed one continued
maſs; and at 80° 36′ the ſea was entirely frozen;
ſo that all the attempts of Captain Phipps to
diſcover a paſſage proved abortive.' 'On the
12th of September, Dr Irvine tried the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the ſea in a ſtate of great agitation,
and found it conſiderably warmer than that of
the atmoſphere. This obſervation is the more
intereſting, as it agrees with a paſſage in Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch's
Natural Queſtions, not (I believe) before
taken notice of, or confirmed by experiment,
in which he remarks,' 'that the ſea becomes
warmer by being agitated in waves. . . . Theſe
gales are as common in the ſpring as in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn;
there is every reaſon to ſuppoſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that at an early ſeaſon we ſhould have met
with the ſame bad weather in going out as we
did on our return.' And, as Captain Phipps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from England in the end of May, he
certainly took the ſeaſon moſt favourable to his
expedition. . . . 'There was alſo moſt probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if ever navigation ſhould be practicable to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0195500109:100"/>
Pole, of finding the ſea open to the northward
after the ſolſtice; the ſun having then exerted
the full influence of his rays, though there was
enough of the ſummer ſtill remaining for the
purpoſe of exploring the ſeas to the northward
and weſtward of Spitzbergen.'</p>
                  <p>I agree entirely with this able navigator; and
I ſuſpect that the expedition to the Pole cannot
be renewed with ſucceſs, and that we can never
reach beyond the 82d or 83<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> degree. We are
aſſured that a veſſel from Whitby, in the year
1774, penetrated as far as the 80th degree, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeing ice ſufficient to prevent ſailing ſtill
farther. A Captain Robinſon is likewiſe quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
from whoſe journal it appears that, in
1773, he arrived at the 81° 30′. Laſtly, a
Dutch ſhip of war, ſent to protect the whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhers,
is ſaid to have advanced, about fifty
years ago, as far as the 88th degree. Dr Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
it is added, received this intelligence from
a Dr <hi>Daillie,</hi> who was in the veſſel, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
phyſic in London in the year 1745<note n="*" place="bottom">Gazette de Literature, Août 9. 1774, No. 61.</note>. This
is probably the ſame navigator whom I formerly
quoted under the name of Captain Mouton.
But I am extremely ſuſpicious of the fact; and
I am perſuaded, that we ſhall in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to reach beyond the 82d or 83d degree,
and that, if a paſſage by the north is practicable,
it can only be by the way of Hudſon's bay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0195500109:101"/>
On this ſubject, the following paſſage of the
learned and ingenious author of the hiſtory of
the Two Indies merits attention, 'Hudſon's bay
always has been, and is ſtill looked upon as the
neareſt road from Europe to the Eaſt Indies,
and to the richeſt parts of Aſia.'</p>
                  <p>'Cabot was the firſt who entertained an idea
of a north-weſt paſſage to the South-ſeas; but
his diſcoveries ended at Newfoundland. After
him followed a crowd of Engliſh navigators,
many of whom had the honour of giving their
names to ſavage coaſts which no mortal had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
viſited before. Theſe bold and memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
expeditions were more ſtriking than really
uſeful. The moſt fortunate of them did not
furniſh a ſingle idea relative to the object of
purſuit. The Dutch, leſs frequent in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
and who purſued them with leſs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
were of courſe not more ſucceſsful, and
the whole began to be treated as a chimera,
when the diſcovery of Hudſon's bay rekindled
all the hopes that were nearly extinguiſhed.'</p>
                  <p>'From this time the attempts were renewed
with freſh ardour. Thoſe that had been made
before in vain by the mother-country, whoſe
attention was engroſſed by her own inteſtine
commotions, were purſued by New England,
whoſe ſituation was favourable to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.
Still, however, for ſome time there
were more voyages undertaken than diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0195500109:102"/>
made. The nation was a long time kept
in ſuſpenſe by the contradictory accounts recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the adventurers. While ſome main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the poſſibility, ſome the probability,
and others aſſerted the certainty of the paſſage;
the accounts they gave, inſtead of clearing up
the point, involved it in ſtill greater darkneſs.
Indeed, theſe accounts are ſo full of obſcurity
and confuſion, they are ſilent upon ſo many
important circumſtances, and they diſplay ſuch
viſible marks of ignorance and want of vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
that, however impatient we may be of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the queſtion, it is impoſſible to build
any thing like a ſolid judgment upon teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
ſo ſuſpicious. At length, the famous
expedition of 1746 threw ſome kind of light
upon a point which had remained enveloped in
darkneſs for two centuries paſt. But upon
what grounds have the later navigators enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
better hopes? What are the experiments
on which they found their conjectures?'</p>
                  <p>'Let us proceed to give an account of their
arguments. There are three facts in natural
hiſtory, which henceforward muſt be taken
for granted. The firſt is, that the tides come
from the ocean, and that they extend more
or leſs into the other ſeas, in proportion as
their channels communicate with the great
reſervoir by larger or ſmaller openings; from
whence it follows that this periodical motion
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0195500109:103"/>
is ſcarcely perceptible in the Mediterranean, in
the Baltic, and other gulfs of the ſame nature.
A ſecond matter of fact is, that the tides are
much later and much weaker in places more
remote from the ocean, than in thoſe which
are nearer to it. The third fact is, that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
winds, which blow in a direction with the
tides, make them riſe above their ordinary
boundaries, and that thoſe which blow in a
contrary direction retard their motion, at the
ſame time that they diminiſh their ſwell.'</p>
                  <p>'From theſe principles, it is moſt certain that,
if Hudſon's bay were no more than a gulf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
between two continents, and had no
communication but with the Atlantic, the tides
in it would be very inconſiderable; they would
be weaker in proportion as they were further
removed from the ſource, and would be leſs
ſtrong wherever they ran in a contrary direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the wind. But it is proved by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
made with the greateſt ſkill and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that the tides are very high throughout
the whole bay. It is certain that they are
higher towards the bottom of the bay than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the ſtrait itſelf, or at leaſt in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of it. It is proved that even this
height increaſes whenever the wind blows from
a corner oppoſite to the ſtrait; it is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
certain, that Hudſon's bay has a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0195500109:104"/>
with the ocean, beſide that which
has been already found out.'</p>
                  <p>'Thoſe who have endeavoured to explain
theſe very ſtriking facts, by ſuppoſing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of Hudſon's with Baffin's bay, or
with Davis's ſtraits, are evidently miſtaken.
They would not ſcruple to reject this opinion,
for which indeed there is no real foundation,
if they only conſidered that the tides are much
lower in Davis's ſtraits, and in Baffin's bay,
than in Hudſon's.'</p>
                  <p>'But if the tides in Hudſon's bay can come
neither from the Atlantic ocean, nor from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other northern ſea, in which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
much weaker, it follows that they muſt
have their origin in the South Sea. And this
is ſtill further apparent from another leading
fact, which is, that the higheſt tides ever
obſerved upon theſe coaſts, are always occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the north-weſt winds, which blow
directly againſt the mouth of the ſtrait.'</p>
                  <p>'Having thus determined, as much as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſubject will permit, the exiſtence
of this paſſage ſo long and ſo vainly wiſhed-for,
the next point is to find out in what part of
the bay it is to be expected. From conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every circumſtance, we are induced to
think that the attempts, which have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
made without either choice or method,
ought to be directed towards Welcome bay, on
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0195500109:105"/>
the weſtern coaſt. Firſt, the bottom of the ſea
is to be ſeen there at the depth of about eleven
fathom, which is an evident ſign that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comes from ſome ocean, as ſuch a tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
could not exiſt in waters diſcharged from
rivers, or in melted ſnow or rain. Secondly,
the currents keep this place always free from
ice, while all the reſt of the bay is covered
with it; and their violence cannot be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for but by ſuppoſing them to come from
ſome weſtern ſea. Laſtly, the whales, who
towards the latter end of autumn always go in
ſearch of the warmeſt climates, are found in
great abundance in theſe parts towards the end
of ſummer, which would ſeem to indicate that
there is an outlet for them from thence to the
ſouth ſeas, not to the northern ocean.'</p>
                  <p>'It is probable that the paſſage is very ſhort.
All the rivers that empty themſelves on the
weſtern coaſt of Hudſon's bay are ſmall and
ſlow, which ſeems to prove that they do not
come from any diſtance; and that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the lands which ſeparate the two ſeas are of
a ſmall extent. This argument is ſtrengthened
by the height and regularity of the tides.
Wherever there is no other difference between
the times of the ebb and flow, but that which
is occaſioned by the retarded progreſſion of
the moon in her return to the meridian, it is
a certain ſign that the ocean from whence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0195500109:106"/>
thoſe tides come is very near. If the paſſage
is ſhort, and not very far to the north, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing ſeems to promiſe, we may alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that it is not very difficult. The rapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the currents obſervable in theſe latitudes;
which prevents any flakes of ice from continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, cannot but give ſome weight to this
conjecture.'</p>
                  <p>I believe, with this excellent writer, that if
a practicable paſſage exiſts, it muſt be at the
bottom of Hudſon's bay, and that all attempts
by Baffin's bay will be fruitleſs, becauſe the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
is too cold, and its coaſts are always fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
eſpecially towards the north. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of this paſſage is rendered ſtill more
doubtful by the lands diſcovered, in 1741, by
Bering and Tchirikow, under the ſame latitude
with Hudſon's bay; for theſe lands ſeem to
form a part of the great Continent of America,
which appears to ſtretch under the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
as far as the Polar circle. Of courſe, the
paſſage into the ſouth ſea can only be found
about the 55th degree of north latitude.</p>

ſea has no ſubterraneous communication

contains neither oyſters nor any other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells,

We are, therefore, warranted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that this ſea is nothing but a great lake
formed by the waters of rivers, ſince we find
in it the ſame fiſhes and the ſame ſhells which
inhabit the rivers, and none of thoſe which

                  <p>In the voyages performed under the auſpices
of the Academy of Peterſburg, mention is made
of the ſalt lake of Jamuſcha in Siberia. This
lake, which is nearly round, is only about nine
leagues in circumference. Its margins are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0195500109:110"/>
with ſalt, and the bottom is clothed with
cryſtals of ſalt. The water is extremely ſalt;
and, when the ſun ſhines, it appears reddiſh like
the ſky in a ſine morning. The ſalt is as white
as ſnow, and forms itſelf into cubic cryſtals.
The quantity of it is ſo immenſe, that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of veſſels may, in a ſhort time, be loaded
with it; and, after it has been removed, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
replaced in five or ſix days. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to remark, that it ſupplies the provinces
of Tobolſki and Jeniſeik, and that this lake
could ſupply fifty provinces of ſimilar extent.
The commerce of this, as well as of all other
ſalt, is reſerved in the hands of the crown. This
ſalt is exceedingly good. It ſurpaſſes all others
in whiteneſs, and none is more proper for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
meat. In the ſouth of Aſia, there are
likewiſe ſalt lakes, one near the Euphrates, and
another in the neighbourhood of Barra. There
are others, it is ſaid, near Haleb, and at Larne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
in the iſland of Cyprus. This laſt borders
upon the ſea. The ſalt valley of Barra, being
at no great diſtance from the Euphrates, might
be worked, if its waters were made to run into
this river, and if the earth was good: But at
preſent this earth yields a good ſalt for the
kitchen, and even in ſuch quantity that the
Bengal veſſels, when returning in ballaſt, take
in loadings of this ſalt<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcript. de l'Arabie, par M. Nicbuhr, p. 2.</note>.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0195500109:112"/>
places, there muſt be two different bottoms,
the one often covering the other at intervals:
The ancient and permanent, which may be
called the general bottom, and the other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
or particular. The firſt, which ought to
form the baſis of a general picture, is the ſoil
of the baſin that contains the ſea. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of the ſame ſtrata which we every
where find in the bowels of the earth, ſuch as
marl, ſtone, clay, ſand, ſhells, all diſpoſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontally,
and of an equal thickneſs through
a great extent. . . Here, we find a bottom
of marl, there a bottom of clay, ſand, or rock.
Laſtly, the number of general bottoms diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
by ſounding exceeds not ſix or ſeven
ſpecies. The moſt extenſive and thickeſt of
theſe ſtrata, being uncovered, or cut perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
form great ſpaces in the ſea, where
we ought to recogniſe the general bottom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
of ſuch foreign ſubſtances as
may be depoſited by currents or other cauſes.
There are other permanent bottoms which
we have not hitherto mentioned: Theſe are
thoſe immenſe maſſes of madrepores and
corals, which often cover a bottom of rock,
and thoſe enormous and extended banks of
ſhells, which a rapid multiplication, or other
cauſes, have accumulated, and which occur in
different places, as it were in colonies. One
ſpecies occupies a certain extent; the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0195500109:113"/>
ſpace is occupied by another ſpecies, in
the ſame manner as has been remarked with
regard to foſſil ſhells, in a great part of Europe,
and perhaps every where elſe. It is by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
on the interior parts of earth,
and on ſuch places as the ſea leaves uncovered,
where we always ſee particular ſpecies reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over certain diſtricts, that we have been
enabled to form ſome idea of the prodigious
number of individuals, and of the thickneſs
of the banks at the bottom of the ſea, of which
we can only know the ſurface by our ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.'</p>
                  <p>'The accidental or particular bottom is
compoſed of immenſe numbers of the pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
of the ſea-archin; of fragments of ſhells,
ſometimes corrupted; of cruſtaceous animals;
of madrepores; of ſea plants; of pyrites; of
granites rounded by friction; of pieces of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-of-pearl;
of mica; perhaps of talc, to
which different names are given according
to their appearances; of entire ſhells, but in
ſmall quantity, and ſeemingly diſperſed
through no great extent; of ſmall flints, ſome
cryſtals, coloured ſands, a light ſlime, &amp;c.
All theſe bodies, diſſeminated by the currents,
the agitation of the waters, and partly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

high beaches, and other accidental cauſes, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
perfectly cover the general bottom, which

ſame regions. . . . I remarked, that, during

                  <p>TO the enumeration of currents, we ſhall add
the famous current of Moſckoe, Moſche, or Male,
on the coaſt of Norway, of which a learned
Swede has given the following deſcription.</p>
                  <p>'This current, which took its name from the
rock of Moſchenſicle, ſituated between the two
iſlands of Tofode and Woeroen, extends four
miles from north to ſouth.'</p>
                  <p>'It is extremely rapid, eſpecially between the
rock of Moſche and the point of Lofoede. But,
in proportion as it approaches the two iſles of
Woeroen and Roeſt, its rapidity diminiſhes.
It finiſhes its courſe from north to ſouth in ſix
hours, and from ſouth to north in an equal
time.'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0195500109:115"/>
'This current is ſo rapid, that it produces a
number of ſmall eddies, which the Norwegians
call <hi>gargamer.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>'Inſtead of following the courſe of the tides,
it obſerves an oppoſite direction. When the
waters of the ocean riſe, they proceed from
ſouth to north, but the current then runs from
north to ſouth. When the ſea retires, it goes
from north to ſouth, but the current then runs
from ſouth to north.'</p>
                  <p>'It is remarkable, that, both in going and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
it does not deſcribe a ſtraight line, like
other currents found in ſome ſtraits, where the
waters of the ſea riſe and fall; but it moves in
a circular direction.'</p>
                  <p>'When the waters of the ſea have riſen one
half, thoſe of the current run to the ſouth ſouth-eaſt.
In proportion as the ſea riſes, the current
turns towards the ſouth; from thence it turns
toward the ſouth-weſt, and from the ſouth-weſt
to the weſt.'</p>
                  <p>'When the tide is full, the current goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the north-weſt, and then toward the
north. About the middle of the reflux, the
current recommences its courſe, after having
been ſuſpended during ſome ſeconds.'</p>
                  <p>'The principal phaenomenon is its return by
the weſt from the ſouth ſouth-eaſt toward the
north. If it did not come back by the ſame
road, it would be difficult and almoſt impoſſible
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0195500109:116"/>
to ſail from the point of Lofoede to the two
great iſlands of Woeroen and Roueſt. There
are two pariſhes, which would neceſſarily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited,
if the current obſerved not the courſe
I have deſcribed. But, as it actually obſerves
this courſe, thoſe who paſs from the point of
Lofoede to the two iſlands, wait till the tide
has riſen one half, becauſe the direction of the
current is then to the weſt. When they want
to return from theſe iſlands to the point of
Lofoede, they wait till the tide be half ebb;
becauſe the courſe of the current is then toward
the Continent. This circumſtance renders the
paſſage very eaſy. . . Now, there is no current
without a declivity; and here the water riſes
on one ſide and deſcends by the other. . . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'To be convinced of this truth, we have only
to conſider that there is a ſmall tongue of land
in Norway which extends ſixteen miles into
the ſea, from the point of Lofoede, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
more to the weſt, as far as that of Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,
which inclines more to the eaſt. This
tongue of land is ſurrounded by the ſea; and,
whether during the flux or reflux, the water
is always ſtopt there; becauſe it can have no
iſſue but through ſix ſmall ſtraits or paſſages
which divide the tongue of land into an equal
number of portions. Some of theſe exceed not
half a quarter of a mile in breadth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not half ſo much. Hence they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0195500109:117"/>
only a ſmall quantity of water. Of courſe,
when the ſea riſes, a great part of the water
coming to the north is ſtopt to the ſouth of
this tongue of land. The waters are, therefore,
much more elevated toward the ſouth than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the north. When the ſea retires, and
goes toward the ſouth, a great part of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in the ſame manner, is arreſted to the
north of this tongue of land, and, conſequently,
is much higher towards the north than towards
the ſouth.'</p>
                  <p>'The waters thus interrupted ſometimes, at
the north and ſometimes at the ſouth, can find
an iſſue only between the point of Lofoede
and the iſland of Woeroen, and between this
iſland and that of Roueſt.'</p>
                  <p>'The declivity of the waters, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
produces the rapidity of the current;
and, for the ſame reaſon, this rapidity is greateſt
toward the point of Lofoede. As this point is
neareſt the place where the waters are ſtopt,
the rapidity there is likewiſe greateſt; and, in
proportion as the waters of the current extend
toward the iſlands of Woeroen and Roueſt,
their celerity decreaſes.'</p>
                  <p>'It is now eaſy to conceive why the current
is always diametrically oppoſite to the motion
of the ſea. Nothing oppoſes the common move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the waters, whether they riſe or fall.
But the waters which are ſtopt above the point
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0195500109:118"/>
of Lofoede can neither move in a ſtraight
line, nor beyond this point, while the ſea has
not deſcended lower, and has not, in retiring,
carried off the waters, which thoſe that are
ſtopt above the point of Lofoede ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'At the commencement of the flux and reflux,
the waters of the ſea cannot turn back thoſe of
the current; but, when they have riſen or
fallen one half, they are then enabled to
change the direction of the current. As it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
then turn toward the eaſt, becauſe the water
is always ſtable near the point of Lofoede, as
formerly remarked, it muſt neceſſarily proceed
toward the weſt, where the water is lower<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcript. du courant de Moſckoe, &amp;c. <hi>Journal étranger. Fevrier</hi> 1758, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note>.'
This explication ſeems to be comformable to the
true principles of the theory of running waters.</p>
                  <p>We muſt ſtill add the deſcription of the famous
current of Scylla and Charybdis, near the iſland
of Sicily concerning which Mr Brydone has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made ſome obſervations tending to prove that
the violence and rapidity of its movements are
much diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>'It was almoſt a dead calm, our ſhip ſcarce
moving half a mile in an hour, ſo that we had
time to get a complete view of the famous rock
of Scylla, on the Calabrian ſide, Cape Pylorus
on the Sicilian, and the celebrated Straits of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0195500109:119"/>
the Faro that runs between them. Whilſt we
were ſtill ſome miles diſtant from the entry of
the Straits, we heard the roaring of the current,
like the noiſe of ſome large impetuous river
confined between narrow banks. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in proportion as we advanced, till we
ſaw the water in many places raiſed to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
height, and forming large eddies or
whirlpools. The ſea in every other place was
as ſmooth as glaſs. Our old pilot told us, that
he had often ſeen ſhips caught in theſe eddies,
and whirled about with great rapidity, without
obeying the helm in the ſmalleſt degree.
When the weather is calm, there is little danger;
but when the waves meet with this violent
current, it makes a dreadful ſea. He ſays,
there were five ſhips wrecked in this ſpot laſt
winter. We obſerved that the current ſet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
for the rock of Scylla, and would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
have carried any thing thrown into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that point; ſo that it was not without
reaſon the ancients have painted it as an object
of ſuch terror. It is about a mile from the
entry of the Faro, and forms a ſmall promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
which runs a little out to ſea, and meets
the whole force of the waters, as they come
out of the narroweſt part of the Straits. The
head of this promontory is the famous Scylla.
It muſt be owned that it does not altogether
come up to the formidable deſcription that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0195500109:120"/>
Homer gives of it; the reading of which (like
that of Shakeſpear's Cliff) almoſt makes one's
head giddy. Neither is the paſſage ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
narrow and difficult as he makes it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is probable that the breadth of it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increaſed ſince his time, by the violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity
of the current. And this violence, too,
muſt have always diminiſhed, in proportion as
the breadth of the channel increaſed. The
rock is near 200 feet high. There is a kind of
caſtle or fort built on its ſummit; and the
town of Scylla, or Sciglio, containing three or
four hundred inhabitants, ſtands on its ſouth
ſide, and gives the title of prince to a Calabreſe
family. We lay juſt oppoſite to Cape Pylorus
where the light-houſe is now built. . . . . The
mouth of the Straits, betwixt the promontories
of Pylorus in Sicily, and the Coda de Volpe in
Calabria, appears ſcarcely to be a mile. But
the channel enlarges to four miles in breadth
near Meſſina, which is twelve miles from the
mouth of the Straits. . . The celebrated gulf
or whirlpool of Charybdis lies near to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the harbour of Meſſina, and often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſuch an inteſtine and irregular motion in
the water, that the helm loſes moſt of its power,
and ſhips have great difficulty to get in, even
with the faireſt wind that can blow. . . . Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle
gives a long and formidable deſcription
of it in his 125th chapter, De Admirandis,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0195500109:121"/>
which I find tranſlated in an old Sicilian book
I have got here. It begins, 'Adeo profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
horridumque ſpectaculum,' &amp;c. but it is
too long to tranſcribe. It is likewiſe deſcribed
by Homer, 12th of the Odyſſey; Virgil, 3d
Aeneid; Lucretius, Ovid, Salluſt, Seneca, as
alſo by many of the old Italian and Sicilian
poets, who all ſpeak of it in terms of horror;
and repreſent it as an object that inſpired terror,
even when looked on at a diſtance. It certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is not now ſo formidable; and very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
the violence of this motion, continued for
ſo many ages, has by degrees worn ſmooth the
rugged rocks, and jutting ſhelves, that may
have intercepted and confined the waters. The
breadth of the Straits too, in this place, I make
no doubt is conſiderably enlarged. Indeed,
from the nature of things it muſt be ſo; the
perpetual friction occaſioned by the current
muſt wear away the bank on each ſide, and
enlarge the bed of the water.'</p>
                  <p>'The veſſels in this paſſage were obliged to
go as near as poſſible to the coaſt of Calabria,
in order to avoid the ſuction occaſioned by the
whirling of the waters in this vortex; by
which means, when they came to the narroweſt
and moſt rapid part of the Straits, betwixt
Cape Pylorus and Scylla, they were in great
danger of being carried upon that rock. From
whence the proverb, ſtill applied to thoſe who,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0195500109:122"/>
in attempting to avoid one evil, fall into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
'Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Carybdim.'
Here another light-houſe is placed to warn
ſailors of their approach to Charybdis, as that
other on Cape Pylorus is intended to give them
notice of Scylla<note n="*" place="bottom">Brydone's Tour, vol. 1. p. 40. &amp;c.</note>.'</p>

ſituated at the north of my garden at Montbard.
When a ſtrong ſouth wind blows, we are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
puſhed back, at the diſtance of thirty
paces: After which, there is an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> interval for
five or ſix paces, where the violence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
wind ceaſes, and ſeems to be in equilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
with the direct. The nearer we approach,
the ſtrength of the reflected wind augments,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0195500109:124"/>
and puſhes us back with much greater force
than the direct wind puſhes us forward. The
cauſe of this general effect, which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
oppoſite to any high buildings, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices,
&amp;c. it is not difficult to diſcover. The
air in the direct wind acts only by its celerity
and its common volume; but this volume or
maſs is conſiderably augmented by the compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
it receives from the obſtacle by which it is
reflected; and, as the quantity of every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
conſiſts of the celerity multiplied by the
volume, this quantity is much greater after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compreſſed than before. It is a volume of
common air which acts in the firſt caſe, and
a volume of air of double or triple the denſity
which acts in the ſecond.</p>

                  <head>Of the ſtate of the Air at the top of high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</head>
                  <p>IT has been proved by a thouſand experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that the higher we riſe above the level
of the ſea or of plains, the column of mercury in
the barometer ſinks the lower; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the weight of a column of air diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in proportion to the elevation of the place;
and as air is an elaſtic and compreſſible fluid,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0195500109:125"/>
philoſophers have unanimouſly concluded from
theſe experiments, that the air is much more
denſe and compreſſed in the plains, than on
the tops of mountains. For example, if the
barometer, which ſtands at 27 inches in the
plain, falls, on the top of a mountain, to 18, a
difference of one third of the whole weight of
the column of air, we ſay, that, the compreſſion
of this element being always proportioned to
the incumbent weight, the air at the top of the
mountain is, of courſe, one third leſs denſe
than that in the plain, becauſe it is compreſſed
by a weight one third leſs. But ſtrong reaſons
concur in making me ſuſpect the truth of this
concluſion, which has hitherto been regarded as
natural, and perfectly legitimate.</p>
                  <p>Let us, for a moment, abſtract this compreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the air, which ſeveral cauſes may aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or diminiſh, deſtroy or compenſate: Let
us ſuppoſe the air to be every where equally
denſe; if its thickneſs exceeded not three
leagues, it is certain, that, in mounting one
league, the barometer, being loaded with one
third leſs weight, would deſcend from 27 to 18
inches. Now the air though compreſſible, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to me to be equally denſe at all heights;
and this opinion I ſhall ſupport by the following
facts and reaſonings.</p>
                  <p>1. The winds are equally ſtrong, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
violent at the tops of the higheſt mountains
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0195500109:126"/>
as in the loweſt valleys. With regard to this
fact all obſervers are agreed. Now, if the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the air were one third leſs, the action of
the wind would neceſſarily be one third weaker,
and all the winds at the height of a league
would be only zephirs, which is abſolutely
contradicted by uniform experience.</p>
                  <p>2. Eagles, and ſeveral other birds, not only
fly to the tops of the higheſt mountains, but riſe
to great heights above them. Now, I aſk if
theſe animals could either fly, or even ſupport
themſelves, in a fluid one third leſs denſe than
common air, and if the weight of their bodies,
notwithſtanding all their efforts, would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
them to ſink lower?</p>
                  <p>3. All obſervers, who have climbed to the
tops of the higheſt mountains, agree that they
reſpire as freely as in any other ſituation, and
that the only inconveniency they feel ariſes
from the cold, which augments in proportion
to the elevation. Now, if the air was one
third leſs denſe at the tops of mountains, the
reſpiration of man, and of birds which mount
ſtill higher, would not only be injured, but
ſtopped, as actually happens to animals in an
air pump when one fourth or one third of the
air contained in the receiver is exhauſted.</p>
                  <p>4. As cold condenſes as much as heat rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
the air, and as, in proportion to the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mountains, the cold increaſes, does it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0195500109:127"/>
not follow, that the degrees of condenſation
of the air correſpond to the degrees of cold?
This condenſation may equal, and even ſurpaſs
that of the air in plains, where the heat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping
from the internal parts of the earth is
much greater than at the tops of mountains,
which are the moſt advanced and coldeſt points
on the ſurface of the globe. Hence this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation
of the air by cold, in high regions of
the atmoſphere, ſhould compenſate the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of denſity produced by a decreaſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
weight; and, of courſe, the air ſhould
be equally denſe on the cold ſummits of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
as in the plains. I am even led to think,
that the air is more denſe on the tops of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
becauſe there the winds ſeem to be more
violent, and the birds which ſoar above the
higheſt ſummits appear to ſupport themſelves
in the air with more eaſe in proportion to the
height they riſe.</p>
                  <p>I may, therefore, conclude, that the free air
is nearly of equal denſity at all heights, and
that the atmoſphere extends not ſo high as has
been determined, by conſidering the air as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic
maſs compreſſed by an incumbent weight.
Thus the total thickneſs of the atmoſphere may
not exceed three leagues, inſtead of from fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
to twenty, as has been conjectured by
philoſophers<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Alhazen, from the duration of the twilights, pretended that the height of the atmoſphere is 44331 fathoms. Kepler, upon the ſame principle, makes it 41110 fathoms.</p>
                        <p>M. de la Hire, when treating of the horizontal refraction of 32 minutes, fixes the mean height of the atmoſphere at 34585 fathoms.</p>
                        <p>M. Mariotte, from his experiments on the compreſſibility of air, makes the height of the atmoſphere 30000 fathoms.</p>
                        <p>However, comprehending under the atmoſphere that part of the air only in which refractions take place, M. Bouguer aſcertains the height not to be above 5158 fathoms, i. e. two and a half or three leagues; and I believe that this reſult is more certain and better founded than any of the others.</p>

The firſt ſtratum of the atmoſphere is filled
with vapours exhaled from the ſurface of the
globe, both by its own heat and that of the ſun.
In this ſtratum, which extends to the height
of the clouds, the heat ariſing from exhalations
produces and ſupports a rarefaction that forms
an equipoiſe to the ſuperior air; ſo that the
lower ſtratum of the atmoſphere is not ſo denſe
as it ought to be in proportion to the preſſure
it receives. But, at the height where this
rarefaction ceaſes, the air undergoes all that
condenſation which is produced by the cold of
this region, where the heat ariſing from the
earth is much diminiſhed; and this condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appears to be even greater than that which
might be produced, by the weight of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
ſtrata, in the inferior regions, which
are ſupported by rarefaction. This idea is
ſtrengthened by another phaenomenon, which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0195500109:129"/>
is the condenſation and ſuſpenſation of the
clouds in that elevated region where they are
formed and ſupported. Beyond this middle
region, where the cold and condenſation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
the vapours riſe, but ceaſe to be viſible,
except when a part of a cold ſtratum ſeems to
be puſhed back toward the ſurface of the
earth, and when the heat eſcaping from the
earth being for ſome time extinguiſhed by
rains, the vapours then collect and thicken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
us in the form of miſts and fogs. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe circumſtances, the vapours never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
viſible till they arrive at that region
where the cold condenſes them into clouds,
and ſtops their further aſcenſion: Their gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which augments in proportion as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more denſe, fixes them in an equipoiſe
which they cannot ſurmount. We perceive that
the clouds are generally higher in ſummer, and
ſtill higher in warm climates. It is in this ſeaſon
and in theſe climates that the ſtratum formed by
evaporation from the earth riſes higheſt. On the
contrary, in the frozen regions near the pole,
where the evaporation produced by the heat
of the globe is much leſs, the ſtratum of denſe
air ſeems to touch the ſurface, and there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the clouds, which never riſe higher, but
ſurround theſe gloomy regions with perpetual
fogs.</p>

                  <head>Of ſome Winds which have a regular variation.</head>
                  <p>THERE are certain climates and particular
countries where the winds vary regularly; ſome
at the end of ſix months, others in a few weeks,
others from morning to night, and from night to
morning. In Vol. I. p. 388. I remarked, That,
<hi>at St Domingo, there are two different winds
which riſe regularly every day; the one, which
is from the ſea, comes from the eaſt, and begins at</hi>
10 <hi>o'clock before noon; the other, which is a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
riſes at</hi> 6 <hi>or</hi> 7 <hi>in the evening, and continues
the whole night.</hi> M. Freſnaye writes me, that
my information has not been exact. 'The two
regular winds,' he remarks, 'which blow at
St Domingo, are both from the ſea, and blow,
the one in the morning from the eaſt, and the
other in the evening from the weſt, which is
only the ſame wind returned. It is evidently
occaſioned by the ſun; for, every man perceives
that, between one and two o'clock after noon,
a tranſient guſt ariſes. When the ſun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines,
by rarefying the air on the weſt, it drives
to the eaſt the clouds which the morning wind
had confined toward the oppoſite quarter.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0195500109:131"/>
Theſe returned clouds, from April or May till
toward autumn, produce in the diſtrict of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au-Prince
the regular rains which conſtantly
proceed from the eaſt. There is not a ſingle
inhabitant who does not predict the evening
rain between ſix and nine o'clock, when, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their mode of expreſſion, <hi>the broken
cloud has been ſent back.</hi> The weſt wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
not during the whole night. It falls
regularly toward the evening; and, when it
ceaſes, the clouds puſhed from the eaſt are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to fall in the form of rain, as ſoon as their
weight exceeds that of an equal column of air.
The wind which prevails in the night is a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
which proceeds neither from the eaſt
nor the weſt, but follows the projections of
the coaſt. At Port-au-Prince, the ſouth wind,
becauſe it traverſes the courſe of the river, is
intolerably cold during the months of January
and February<note n="*" place="bottom">Note communicated to M. de Buffon by M. Freſnaye, one of the counſellors of St Domingo, dated March 10. 1777</note>.'</p>

                  <head>Of Lavanges, or great maſſes of Snow and Ice
rolling down from high mountains.</head>
                  <p>IN high mountains, there are winds produced
by accidental cauſes, and particularly by <hi>lavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">I know no ſingle Engliſh word expreſſive of this idea, and therefore retain the French term.</note>.
In the environs of the Alpine glacieres,
ſeveral ſpecies of <hi>lavanges</hi> are diſtinguiſhable;
ſome of them are called <hi>windy lavanges,</hi> becauſe
they produce a great wind. They are formed
when a new fall of ſnow has been put in motion,
either from melting below by the interior heat
of the earth, or by the agitation of the air. The
ſnow then forms itſelf into balls, and in rolling
accumulates, falls in vaſt maſſes into the valleys,
and produces a great agitation in the air;
becauſe the ſnow runs with rapidity, and in
immenſe volumes, and the winds occaſioned by
the motion of theſe maſſes are ſo impetuous, that
they overturn every thing, even the largeſt pines,
that oppoſe their paſſage. Theſe lavanges
cover the whole territory over which they extend
with a very fine ſnow; and this powdered ſnow
riſes in the air at the caprice of the winds, <hi>i. e.</hi>
without any fixed direction, which is extremely
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0195500109:133"/>
dangerous to people in the fields; becauſe they
know not to what ſide to run in order to protect
themſelves; for, in a few ſeconds, they find
themſelves ſurrounded, and often completely
buried with the ſnow.</p>
                  <p>Another ſpecies of <hi>lavanges,</hi> ſtill more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than the firſt, is called by the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Schlaglawen, <hi>i. e. daſhing</hi> or <hi>ſtriking lavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
They proceed not with ſuch rapidity as
the firſt kind; but they overturn every thing
in their way, and carry along with them great
quantities of earth, ſtones, flints, and even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
trees; ſo that their paſſage from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the valley is a vaſt track of deſtruction
and ruin. As they proceed with leſs rapidity
than the <hi>lavanges</hi> compoſed of pure ſnow, they
are more eaſily avoided. Their approach is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
at a diſtance; for they ſhake the
mountains and the valleys by their motion and
weight, and produce a noiſe equal to that of
thunder.</p>
                  <p>Theſe tremendous effects may proceed from
very ſlight cauſes: A ſmall quantity of ſnow
falling from a tree or a rock, the ſound of bells,
or the ſhock of a cannon or muſket, provided
they detach ſome portions of ſnow from the
ſummit, which form into balls, and increaſe in
magnitude as they deſcend, will accumulate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a maſs as large as a ſmall mountain before
they arrive at the valley.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0195500109:134"/>
The inhabitants of countries ſubject to <hi>lavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
have invented ſeveral precautions to prevent
their deſtructive effects. They place their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
oppoſite to ſmall eminences, which may
break the force of the <hi>lavanges.</hi> They likewiſe
make plantations of wood before their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
At Mount St Godard, there is a foreſt
in a triangular form, the acute angle of which
is directed towards the mountain, and ſeems to
have been planted with a view to turn off the
<hi>lavanges</hi> from the village of Urſeren and the
buildings ſituated at the foot of the mountain;
and every perſon is forbid, under the ſevereſt
penalties, to injure the foreſt, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as the ſafeguard of the village. With
the ſame intention there are, in many places,
walls erected with their acute angles turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the mountain. A wall of this kind may
be ſeen at Davis, in the country of the Griſons,
as alſo near the baths of Leuk or Louache in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais.
In the ſame country of the Griſons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, there are, in the paſſages through
the mountains, vaults at convenient diſtances,
cut out of the rock on the ſide of the high-way,
which ſerve paſſengers as places of refuge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                  <p>THE Ruſſian voyagers have remarked, that,
in the entry to the territory of Milim,
there is, on the left of the river Lena, a great
plain entirely covered with overturned trees,
and that all theſe trees lie in a direction from
ſouth to north for an extent of ſeveral leagues;
ſo that the whole diſtrict, formerly covered with
trees, is now ſtrewed with dead trunks in the
above direction from ſouth to north. This ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the ſouth winds has likewiſe been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in other northern regions.</p>
                  <p>In Greenland, and particularly in the autumn,
the winds are ſo impetuous, that the houſes are
often ſhaken to pieces, and the boats and tents
carried up into the air. The Greenlanders even
aſſure us, that, when they go out to ſecure
their boats, they are obliged to creep on their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0195500109:136"/>
bellies, leſt they ſhould become the ſport of the
winds. The moſt violent tempeſts come from
the ſouth, turn to the north, and then terminate
in a calm. It is on theſe occaſions that the ice

                  <p>M. de la Nux, whom I have often quoted,
and who lived forty years in the iſle of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
has had an opportunity of ſeeing a great
number of water-ſpouts, and he has commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to me his obſervations, of which the
following is an abridgement.</p>
                  <p>The water-ſpouts obſerved by M. de la Nux
were formed, 1. In calm days, and in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
when the wind paſſes from the ſouth to
the north; though he ſaw one, which was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
previous to this paſſage of the wind from one
quarter to another, and even in the current of a
north wind, <hi>i e.</hi> a pretty long time before this
wind had ceaſed: The cloud from which this
water-ſpout depended, and to which it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached,
was ſtill violently driven to the ſouth.
The ſun, at the ſame time, was ſeen behind the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0195500109:137"/>
cloud to the ſouth. It happened on the 6th day
of January, about eleven o'clock before noon.</p>
                  <p>2. Theſe water-ſpouts are formed during the
day in detached clouds, apparently very thick,
much longer than broad, and well defined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the direction of the horizon: The under
part of theſe clouds is always very black.</p>
                  <p>3. All theſe water-ſpouts at firſt appear under
the form of inverted cones, whoſe baſes are
more or leſs extenſive.</p>
                  <p>4. Several of thoſe water-ſpouts that appear
under the figure of inverted cones, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
attached to the ſame cloud; ſome are
never entirely completed; ſome are diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at a ſmall diſtance from the cloud; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
deſcend apparently very near to the ſurface
of the ſea, under the form of a long flat cone,
which is narrow and pointed at the bottom. In
the centre of this cone, and through its whole
length, there is a whitiſh tranſparent canal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one third of the diameter of the cone, the
two ſides of which were very black, eſpecially
on their firſt appearance.</p>
                  <p>Theſe water-ſpouts were obſerved from a
point in the iſle of Bourbon elevated 150 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
above the level of the ſea, and they were
generally three, four, or five leagues from the
place of obſervation, which was the houſe of
M. de la Nux.</p>

                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0195500109:138"/>
The following is a more particular deſcription
of theſe water-ſpouts.</p>
                  <p>When the end of the ſhaft, or top of the
cone, which is then very ſharp pointed, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
about a fourth of the diſtance of the
cloud from the ſea, we begin to perceive on its
ſurface, which is commonly calm and of a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
whiteneſs, a ſmall black circle, which is
produced by the agitation and whirling of the
water: In proportion as the point of this ſhaft
deſcends, the water boils; this boiling increaſes
in proportion as the point approaches toward
the ſurface, and the water of the ſea riſes in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
whirlings to a greater or ſmaller height,
which, in the largeſt water ſpouts, is about
twenty-feet. The end of the ſhaft is always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
this whirling, the ſize of which is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to that of the water-ſpout which puts it
in motion. The end of the ſhaft ſeems not to
touch the ſurface of the ſea, otherwiſe than by
joining itſelf to the boiling or whirling which
riſes to meet it.</p>
                  <p>We ſometimes ſee larger and ſmaller cones of
water-ſpouts proceeding from the ſame cloud;
ſome of them have the appearance of threads,
and others are much larger. We often ſee ten
or a dozen of ſmall but complete water-ſpouts
iſſuing from the ſame cloud, moſt of which are
diſſipated near their exit, and viſibly aſcend to
the cloud. In this laſt caſe, the ſhaft ſuddenly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0195500109:139"/>
ſwells as far as the inferior extremity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
like a cylinder ſuſpended from the cloud,
torn in pieces below, and of a ſmall extent.</p>
                  <p>The water-ſpouts with broad baſes gradually
enlarge through their whole extent, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the under end, which ſeems to recede
from the ſea and to approach the cloud. The
agitation and whirling they produce in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gradually diminiſhes, and the under part of
the ſhaft ſoon enlarges and aſſumes nearly a cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
form. It is in this ſtate that the two
ſides of the canal widen; and we then ſee the
water ruſhing with rapidity, and in a ſpiral
form, into the cloud. Laſtly, the appearance
of the water-ſpout terminates by the ſucceſſive
ſhortening of this ſpecies of cylinder.</p>
                  <p>The largeſt water-ſpouts remain longeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſſipating; and ſome of them continue more
than half an hour.</p>
                  <p>A torrent of rain generally ruſhes out of the
ſamé part of the cloud from which the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouts
iſſue, and ſome of them not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtill adhere to the cloud; theſe torrents of
rain often conceal water-ſpouts before they are
diſſipated. I perceived diſtinctly, M. de la Nux
remarks, on the 26th of October 1755, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſpout
in the middle of one of theſe torrents,
which became ſo great that it was ſoon conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from my view.</p>
                  <p>The wind, or the agitation of the air below
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0195500109:140"/>
the cloud, breaks neither the large nor the ſmall
water-ſpouts; for this impulſion only declines
them from the perpendicular. The ſmalleſt
kinds form very remarkable curves, and even ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuoſities.
The extremity which terminates in
the ſea is often far removed from the direction
of the other which is attached to the cloud.</p>
                  <p>We never ſee new water-ſpouts formed after
rain has fallen from the clouds which produced
them.</p>
                  <p>'On the 14th day of June 1756, about four
o'clock afternoon, I was,' ſays M. de la Nux,
'on the margin of the ſea, and above its level
twenty or twenty-five feet. I ſaw twelve or
fourteen water-ſpouts iſſue from the ſame
cloud. Three of them only were conſiderable,
and particularly the laſt. The canal in the
middle of the cylinder was ſo tranſparent, that,
as the ſun ſhone, I ſaw the clouds behind it.
The cloud which produced ſo many water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouts
extended nearly from ſouth-eaſt to
ſouth-weſt; and the large water-ſpout under
conſideration appeared in the ſouth-ſouth-weſt
from my ſtation. The ſun was very low; for
the days were then about the ſhorteſt. I ſaw no
rain proceed from the cloud: Its height ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be from five to ſix hundred fathoms.'</p>
                  <p>The more the ſky is obſcured with clouds,
water-ſpouts, and the phaenomena which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
them, are the more eaſily obſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0195500109:141"/>
M. de la Nux thinks, and perhaps with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that water-ſpouts are nothing but viſcous
portions of a cloud driven off by different whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,
<hi>i. e.</hi> by the whirlings of the ſuperior air
ſinking into the maſs of vapours of which the
whole cloud is compoſed.</p>
                  <p>What ſeems to prove that theſe water-ſpouts
are compoſed of viſcous parts, is the tenaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their coheſion; for they make inflexions
and curvatures in every direction, without
breaking: If the matter of water-ſpouts was not
viſcous, how can we conceive that they ſhould,
without breaking, bend and obey the motion of
the winds? If all the parts did not firmly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here,
the wind would diſſipate them, or, at
leaſt, make them change their form. But, as
the form, both of the large and ſmall water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouts,
is uniformly the ſame, this is almoſt a
certain indication of the viſcous tenacity of the
matter of which they are compoſed.</p>
                  <p>Thus the baſis of the matter of water-ſpouts
is a viſcous ſubſtance contained in the clouds,
and every water-ſpout is formed by a whirlwind
of air preſſing through the maſs of vapours, and,
by blowing up the inferior part of the cloud,
pierces it, and deſcends with its covering of viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
matter. And, as complete water-ſpouts
deſcend from the cloud to the ſurface of the ſea,
the water muſt boil and whirl at the place to
which the end of the water-ſpout is directed;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0195500109:142"/>
becauſe the air blows from the extremity of the
water-ſpout like the tube of a pair of bellows.
The effects of this blowing upon the ſea will
augment, in proportion as the cylinder approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the ſurface of the water; and, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice
of the tube enlarges, a greater quantity of
air is permitted to eſcape, and the agitation of
the water is, of courſe, increaſed.</p>
                  <p>It has been imagined, that water-ſpouts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off and contained great quantities of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water:
The rains, or rather the ſpray, which
often fall in the neighbourhood of water-ſpouts,
have ſtrengthened this prejudice. The canal
in the middle of every ſpecies of water-ſpout is
always tranſparent, on whatever ſide it is view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
If the water of the ſea ſeems to riſe, it is
not in this canal, but only on its ſides. Almoſt
every water-ſpout ſuffers inflections, and often
in oppoſite directions, in the form of an <hi>S,</hi> the
one end of which is in the cloud, and the other
in the ſea. Hence theſe water-ſpouts of which
we have been treating, cannot contain water
either to be poured into the ſea, or raiſed to the
cloud. Of courſe, they can be attended with
no danger, except what proceeds from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity
of the air which eſcapes from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
orifice; for we are aſſured by every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who has had an opportunity of obſerving
theſe water-ſpouts, that they are ſolely compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of air confined in a viſcous cloud, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0195500109:143"/>
by its whirling to the ſurface of the
ſea.</p>
                  <p>M. de la Nux has ſeen water ſpouts around
the iſle of Bourbon in the months of January,
May, June, and October, <hi>i. e.</hi> in all ſeaſons of
the year. He has ſeen them in calm weather, and
during the higheſt winds. Theſe phaenomena,
however, may be ſaid to be rare, and ſeldom
appear but upon the ſea; becauſe the viſcoſity
of the clouds can only proceed from the bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and greaſy particles raiſed, by the heat of
the ſun and the winds, from the waters of the
ſea, and collected in the clouds near its ſurface.
It is for this reaſon that water-ſpouts ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
on land, where there is not, as on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the ſea, a ſufficient quantity of bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and oily particles to be exhaled by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſun. They are ſometimes, however,
obſerved on land, and even at great diſtances
from the ſea; this effect may be produced, when
viſcous clouds have been rapidly driven by a
violent wind from the ſea toward the land. M.
Grignon, in the month of June 1768, ſaw a
well formed water-ſpout in Lorrain near Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villier,
among the hills which are a continuation
of the Voſges. It was about fifty fathoms high.
Its form was that of a column, and it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with a large thick cloud. It was impell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by one or ſeveral winds, which made the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſpout
turn rapidly; and it produced lightning
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0195500109:144"/>
and thunder. This water-ſpout continued ſeven
or eight minutes only, and broke upon the baſe
of the hill, which is from five to ſix hundred
feet high<note n="*" place="bottom">Note communicated by M. Grignon to M. de Buffon, Aug. 6. 1777.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Water-ſpouts have been mentioned by ſeveral
voyagers; but no man has examined them with
ſuch accuracy as M. de la Nux. For example,
theſe voyagers tell us, that, when water-ſpouts
are forming, a black ſmoke riſes on the ſurface of
the ſea: This appearance, we are certain, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,
and proceeds ſolely from the ſituation
of the obſerver. If he is placed on a ſituation ſo
elevated that the diſtance of the whirling exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the water by the ſpout, exceeds not his
ſenſible horizon, he will ſee nothing but the
water riſing and falling back in rains, without
any mixture of ſmoke. This fact is apparent
when the ſun ſhines on the place where the
phaenomenon happens.</p>
                  <p>Theſe water-ſpouts have nothing in common
with thoſe agitations and ſmoke ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by ſubmarine fires, and of which we have
formerly treated. Water-ſpouts neither contain
nor excite any ſmoke. They are every where
rare: They are moſt frequent in the ſeas of warm
climates, and where, at the ſame time, calms
are common, and the winds are moſt inconſtant.
They are likewiſe more frequent, perhaps, near
iſlands and coaſts than in the open ſea.</p>

                  <head>Of Earthquakes.</head>
                  <p>EARTHQUAKES are produced by two
cauſes: The firſt is the ſudden ſinking
of cavities in the bowels of the earth; and the
ſecond, which is ſtill more frequent and more
violent than the firſt, is the action of ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
fires.</p>
                  <p>When a cavern ſinks in the middle of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
it produces a commotion which extends
to a greater or ſmaller diſtance, in proportion to
the quantity of motion excited by the fall of this
maſs of earth; and, if this maſs is inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or falls from no great height, it will not
produce a ſuccuſſion ſo violent as to be perceived
at a great diſtance; the effect is limited to the
neighbourhood of the ſunk cavern; and if the
movement is propagated to greater diſtances,
it is only by ſlight tremblings or vibrations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0195500109:146"/>
As moſt of the primitive mountains reſt upon
caverns, becauſe, at the moment of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation,
theſe eminences were blown up by
the action of the internal fire, ſinkings in the
mountains have happened, and ſtill happen,
whenever the vaults of the caverns are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by water, or ſhaken by any convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
An entire portion of a mountain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſinks perpendicularly, but oftener inclines,
and not unfrequently reverſes. Of this we have
ſtriking examples in ſeveral of the Pyrennees,
where the ſtrata, formerly horizontal, are often
inclined more than forty-five degrees; which
ſhows, that the entire maſs of each portion of
the mountain, whoſe ſtrata were parallel to each
other, has inclined by the lump, and, in the
moment of its ſinking, reſted upon a baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the horizon forty-five degrees. This
is the moſt general cauſe of the inclination of
ſtrata in mountains. For the ſame reaſon, we
often find, between the adjacent eminences,
ſtrata which deſcend from the firſt and riſe to
the ſecond, after having traverſed the valley.
Theſe ſtrata are horizontal, and are bedded at
the ſame height in the two oppoſite hills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which the cavern had fallen in. The
earth ſinks down, and the valley is formed,
without producing any other derangement than
a greater or ſmaller inclination of the ſtrata, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0195500109:147"/>
to the depth of the valley, or the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the two oppoſite hills.</p>
                  <p>This is the only ſenſible effect of the ſinking
of caverns in mountains and other parts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents.
But, whenever this effect happens in
the bottom of the ſea, where ſinkings muſt be more
frequent than on the land, becauſe the water per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
undermines the vaults in every place
where they ſupport the bottom of the ocean,
theſe ſinkings not only derange and incline the
ſtrata, but ſenſibly lower the level of the ſea.
From the firſt occupation of the waters, their
level has been depreſſed two thouſand fathoms
by theſe ſinkings; and, as all the ſubmarine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
have not yet fallen in, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the baſin of the ſea, by growing
more and more deep, will leſſen its ſurface,
and, of courſe, that the extent of all the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
will always continue to augment by the
retreat and ſinking of the waters.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond and more powerful cauſe than the
firſt concurs in producing the ſame effect. This
cauſe is the rupture and ſinking of caverns by
the action of ſubmarine fires. It is certain,
that no motion or ſinking in the bottom of the
ſea can happen without diminiſhing its ſurface:
And, if we conſider the general effects of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
fires, we will perceive that, as long
as there is fire, the commotions of the earth will
not be confined to ſimple tremblings; for the
efforts of fire raiſe and open the ſea and the land
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0195500109:148"/>
by violent and reiterated ſuccuſſions, which not
only overturn and deſtroy the adjacent lands,
but ſhake thoſe that are diſtant, and ravage or
derange every thing in the route of their direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The earthquakes occaſioned by ſubterraneous
ſires generally precede eruptions of volcano's,
and ſometimes ceaſe the moment the fire opens
a paſſage through the earth, and carries its flames
into the air. Theſe dreadful earthquakes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
continue during the whole time of eruptions.
Theſe two effects are intimately connected.
There is never a great eruption of a volcano
without being preceded, or at leaſt accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
with an earthquake. But we often feel
very violent ſuccuſſions of the earth without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eruption of fire. Thoſe movements in which
fire has no part, proceed not only from the firſt
cauſe, the falling in of caverns, but likewiſe
from the action of ſubterraneous winds and
ſtorms. There are many examples of lands rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or ſunk by the force of theſe internal winds.
Sir William Hamilton, a man as reſpectable for
his private character, as admirable for the extent
of his knowledge and reſearches on this ſubject,
told me that he had ſeen between Trente and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,
near the village of Roveredo, ſeveral little
hills compoſed of large maſſes of calcarious ſtones,
which had evidently been raiſed by different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions
of ſubterraneous winds. There is no
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0195500109:149"/>
indication of the action of fire upon any of theſe
rocks or their fragments. The whole country,
on both ſides of the highway, for an extent of
near a league, has, from place to place, been
overturned by the prodigious efforts of ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
winds: The inhabitants ſay that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
ſuddenly, and was the effect of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</p>
                  <p>But the force of the wind, however violent,
appears not to be a cauſe ſufficient to produce
ſuch great effects; and, though there be no
marks of fire in theſe little hills raiſed by the
commotion of the earth, I am perſuaded that
they have been elevated by electrical exploſions
of ſubterraneous thunder, and that the internal
winds have contributed to this effect ſolely by
producing electrical ſtorms in the cavities of the
earth. Hence all convulſive movements of the
earth may be referred to three cauſes: The firſt
and moſt ſimple is the ſinking of caverns; the
ſecond, ſtorms and ſubterraneous thunder; and
the third, the action of fire kindled in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
parts of the globe. It is eaſy to aſcribe
to one or other of theſe three cauſes all the
phaenomena which accompany or ſucceed earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</p>
                  <p>Commotions of the earth ſometimes give riſe
to eminences; but they more frequently produce
gulfs. On the 15th day of October 1773, a
gulf opened in the territory of Induno, in the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0195500109:150"/>
State of Modena, the cavity of which was
more than four hundred fathoms wide by two
hundred deep<note n="*" place="bottom">Journ. hiſt. et politique, Dec. 10. 1773, <hi>art. Milan.</hi>
                     </note>. In 1726, a mountain of a
conſiderable height, ſituated in the northern part
of Iceland, was ſunk in one night by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
and a very deep lake aſſumed its place.
The ſame night, about a league and a half
diſtant, an ancient lake, the depth of which was
unknown, was entirely dried up, and its bottom
raiſed in ſuch a manner as to form a pretty high
hill, which ſtill exiſts<note n="†" place="bottom">Melanges interaſſans, tom. 1. p. 159.</note>. In the ſeas in the
neighbourhood of New Britain, M. Bougain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville
remarks, earthquakes have terrible effects
on navigation. On the 17th of June, the 12th
and 27th of July 1768, there were three earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
at Boero, and on the 22d of the ſame
month, one at new Brittany. Theſe earthquakes
ſometimes annihilate iſlands and known ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks,
and ſometimes create them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Voyage autour du Monde, tom. 2. p. 278.</note>.</p>
                  <p>There are earthquakes which extend to great
diſtances; but they are always longer than broad.
One of the moſt conſiderable was that felt in
Canada in the year 1663. It extended more
than two hundred leagues in length and one
hundred in breadth, <hi>i. e.</hi> more than twenty
thouſand ſuperficial leagues. The effects of the
laſt earthquake in Portugal, which happened
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0195500109:151"/>
in our own time, were felt ſtill farther. M. le Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
de Saint-Sauveur, King's commandant
at Merucis, informed M. de Genſanne, that,
when walking on the left margin of Jouante
in Languedoc, the ſky ſuddenly became very
dark, and that, in a moment after, he perceived,
at the foot of the hill which is ſituated to the
right of that river, a terrible bright globe of fire:
Immediately there aroſe from the bowels of
the earth a conſiderable maſs of rocks, and the
whole chain of mountains ſplit from Merucis
to Florac, an extent of near ſix leagues. This
rent, in ſome places, is more than two feet wide,
and has partly fallen in<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Nat. de Languedoc, par M. de Genſanne, tom. 1. p. 231.</note>. There are other
earthquakes which produce little or no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Kolbe relates, that, on the 24th of
September 1707, from eight to ten o'clock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
noon, the ſea roſe upon the land at the
Cape of Good Hope and deſcended ſeven times
ſucceſſively, and with ſuch rapidity, that, from
one moment to another, the place was alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covered and left by the waters<note n="†" place="bottom">Deſcript. du Cap de Bonne-Eſperance, tom. 2. p. 237.</note>.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the effects of earthquakes,
the falling of mountains, and the ſinking of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
I ſhall ſubjoin a few facts, which are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0195500109:152"/>
both recent and well atteſted. In Norway, a
whole promontory called <hi>Hammersfields,</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
fell<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Nat. de Norwége, par Pontoppidan; <hi>Journal étran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Aoút</hi> 1755.</note>. A very high mountain, near that
of Chimboraço, one of the higheſt of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers
in the province of Quito, tumbled down
in a moment. This fact, with all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
is related in the memoirs of M. de la
Condamine and Bouguer. Similar fallings
and ſinkings often happen in the ſouthern
iſlands of India. At Gamma-canore, where
the Dutch have a ſettlement, a high mountain
fell ſuddenly in the year 1673, when the
weather was fine: It was followed by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
which overturned the neighbouring vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
and deſtroyed ſeveral thouſands of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. de Voyages, tom. 17. p. 54.</note>.
On the 11th of Auguſt 1772, in the
iſland of Java and province of Cheribou, one of
the richeſt ſettlements of the Dutch, a mountain,
of about three leagues in circumference, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſunk, and roſe and ſunk alternately like
waves in a ſtormy ocean: It at the ſame
time threw out many globes of fire, which
were ſeen at a great diſtance, and gave a light
as brilliant as that of day: All the plantations,
together with about two thouſand one hundred
and forty inhabitants, without reckoning ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
were entirely ſwallowed up<note n="‡" place="bottom">See gazette de France, 21. Maii 1773, <hi>art. de la Hai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE baſe of Aetna is about ſixty leagues in
circumference, and its perpendicular height a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two thouſand fathoms above the level of
the Mediterranean ſea. We may, therefore,
regard this enormous mountain as an obtuſe
cone, the ſuperficies of which is not leſs than
three hundred ſquare leagues. This conical
ſurface is divided into four zones, ſituated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrically
above each other. The firſt is the
largeſt, and, by a gradual aſcent, extends above
ſix leagues from the moſt diſtant point at the
foot of the mountain. This zone of ſix leagues
broad is almoſt totally peopled and cultivated.
The city of Catania and ſeveral villages are ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in this firſt zone, the ſurface of which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0195500109:155"/>
exceeds two hundred and twenty ſquare
leagues. The baſis of this vaſt territory conſiſts
of various ſtrata of ancient and modern lavas,
that have run from different parts of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
from which exploſions of ſubterraneous
fires have iſſued. The ſurface of this lava,
mixed with aſhes thrown out from different
craters, is converted into a fine ſoil, which is now
ſown with grain and planted with vines, except
in a few places where the lava is too recent,
and ſtill remains uncovered with earth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the top of the zone, we ſtill ſee ſeveral cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
more or leſs large and deep, from which
the materials iſſued that have formed the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſtratum or ſoil.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond zone commences at the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe ſix leagues. This ſecond zone is
an aſcent of about two leagues broad. Its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
is every where more rapid than that of
the firſt zone; and this rapidity augments in
proportion as you approach toward the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
The ſurface of this ſecond zone is about
forty or forty-five ſquare leagues: Its whole
extent is covered with magnificent foreſts, and
form a fine belt of verdure to the white and
hoary head of this venerable mountain. The
ſoil of theſe fine foreſts is nothing but lava and
aſhes converted by the operation of time into
excellent earth. What is ſtill more remarkable,
the ſurface of this zone is ſo unequal, that it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0195500109:156"/>
where preſents hills, or rather mountains;
all of which have been produced by different
eruptions from the ſummit of Aetna, and other
craters below the ſummit, ſeveral of which
have formerly acted in this very zone, now
converted into foreſts.</p>
                  <p>Before arriving at the ſummit, and after
having paſſed theſe fine foreſts, we traverſe a
third zone, which gives birth to ſmall vegetables
only. In winter, this region is covered with
ſnow, which melts in ſummer. We afterwards
meet with a line of permanent ſnow, which
marks the commencement of the fourth zone,
and extends to the top of the mountain. Theſe
ſnows and ice occupy about two leagues from
the region of ſmall vegetables to the ſummit,
which is likewiſe covered with ſnow and ice.
Its figure is an exact cone; and it contains
the great crater of the volcano; from which are
continually diſcharged immenſe volumes of
ſmoke. The internal figure of the crater is
that of an inverted cone. It is compoſed of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but aſhes and other burnt matters thrown
out by the mouth of the crater, which is in the
centre of the volcano. The external ſurface of
the ſummit is very rough. The ſnow is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with aſhes, and the cold is very piercing:
On the north ſide of this region of ſnow, there
are ſeveral ſmall lakes which never freeze:
In general, the ſurface of this laſt zone is pretty
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0195500109:157"/>
equal, and obſerves the ſame declivity, except in
a few places; and it is below this region only
where we meet with a great number of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities,
eminences, and hollows produced by
eruptions, and where we ſee hills and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
more or leſs recently formed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of burnt matters rejected by theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
mouths or craters.</p>
                  <p>In 1770, according to Mr Brydone, the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on the top of Aetna was more than a league
in circumference; and very different dimenſions
have been aſcribed to it both by ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
authors. All theſe authors, however,
were right; for the dimenſions of this mouth of
fire have undergone many alterations. All
we can infer from the various deſcriptions that
have been given of it, is, that the crater with its
margins have been four times overturned within
theſe ſix or ſeven hundred years. The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of which it is compoſed fall back into the
bowels of the mountain, are again rejected by
freſh eruptions, and form a new crater, which
augments and riſes by degrees, till it again falls
back into the great gulf of the volcano.</p>
                  <p>The top of the mountain is not the only
place from which the ſubterraneous fire has been
diſcharged. Through the whole territory which
forms the ſides and ridge of Aetna, and at great
diſtances from the ſummit, there are many
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0195500109:158"/>
craters which give paſſage to the fire, and which
are ſurrounded with broken rocks that had been
diſcharged by different eruptions. We may
even reckon ſeveral hills formed by the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of theſe ſmall volcano's which ſurround
the great one. Each of theſe hills has a crater
at its top, in the centre of which is a deep
mouth or gulf. Every eruption of Aetna has
produced a new mountain; and, perhaps, Mr
Brydone remarks, their number would determine,
better than any other method, that of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this famous volcano.</p>
                  <p>The city of Catania, which is ſituated at the
foot of Mount Aetna, has often been laid in ruins
by the lavas which iſſued from theſe new moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
during the time of their formation. In
aſcending from Catania to Nicoloſi, we traverſe
twelve miles through a country formed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
lavas, where we ſee the mouths of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
volcano's, which at preſent are fertile
lands, covered with graſs, corn, and vineyards.
The lavas which form this region proceeded
from the eruptions of the ſmall mountains,
which are every where diſperſed over the ſides
of Aetna: They are all without exception, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regular hemiſpheres or cones. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
every eruption raiſed one of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
Hence the action of the ſubterraneous
fires does not always reach the ſummit of Aetna.
They often iſſue from the ſides, and even from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0195500109:159"/>
the foot of this burning mountain. Each e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
from the ſides of Aetna commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a new mountain compoſed of rocks, ſtones,
and aſhes projected to a great diſtance by the
force of the fire; and the magnitude of theſe
new mountains is proportioned to the duration
of the eruption. If it continues but a few days,
it produces only a little hill, about a league in
circumference at the baſe, and three or four
hundred feet in perpendicular height. But, if
the eruption continues ſome months, like that
of 1669, it then gives riſe to a conſiderable
mountain of two or three leagues in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and nine hundred or a thouſand feet
high; and all theſe hills produced by Aetna,
ſome of which are twelve thouſand feet high,
appear only as ſmall elevations intended to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the majeſty of the parent mountain.</p>
                  <p>In Veſuvius, which is a very ſmall volcano
when compared with Aetna, eruptions from the
ſides of the mountain are rare, and the lava ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
iſſues from the crater at the ſummit.
But, in Aetna, eruptions more frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the ſides than the top, and lava iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
abundantly from every new mountain form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by theſe eruptions. Mr Brydone, according

riſe to the height of 1215 feet, and thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by Aetna riſe 6615 feet; from which we
may conclude, if the obſervations be accurate,
that the force of Aetna is to that of Veſuvius as
441 to 81, <hi>i. e.</hi> five or ſix times greater. That
Veſuvius is a very feeble volcano, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Aetna, is proved in a more forcible
manner by this circumſtance, that Aetna has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
produced other volcano's, which are
larger than that of Veſuvius.</p>
                  <p>'Not a great way from this cavern, are two
of the moſt beautiful mountains of all that
number that ſpring from Aetna. I mounted
one of our beſt mules, and with a good deal
of difficulty arrived at the ſummit of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them, juſt a little before ſun-ſet. The
proſpect of Sicily, with the ſurrounding ſea
and all its iſlands, was wonderfully noble. The
whole courſe of the river Semetus, the ruins
of Hybla, and ſeveral other ancient towns;
the rich corn-fields and vineyards on the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
region of the mountain, and the amazing
number of beautiful mountains below, made a
delightful ſcene. The hollow craters of theſe
two mountains are each of them conſiderably
larger than that of Veſuvius. They are now
filled with ſtately oaks, and covered to a great
depth with the richeſt ſoil. I obſerved that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0195500109:161"/>
this region of Aetna, like the former, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of lava; but this is now covered ſo deep
with earth, that it is no where to be ſeen, but
in the beds of the torrents. In many of theſe
it is worn down by the water to the depth of
fifty or ſixty feet, and in one of them ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
more. . . This conical mountain is of
a very great ſize; its circumference cannot be
leſs than ten miles. Here we took a ſecond
reſt, as the greateſt part of our fatigue ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.
The mercury had fallen to 20:4½.
—We found this mountain exceſſively ſteep;
and although it had appeared black, yet it was
likewiſe covered with ſnow. . . . The preſent
crater of this immenſe volcano is a circle of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three miles and a half in circumference.
It goes ſhelving down on each ſide, and forms
a regular hollow like a vaſt amphitheatre.
From many places of this ſpace, iſſue volumes
of ſulphureous ſmoke, which, being much
heavier than the circumambient air, inſtead of
riſing in it, as ſmoke generally does, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
on its getting out of the crater, rolls
down the ſide of the mountain like a torrent,
till coming to that part of the atmoſphere of
the ſame ſpecific gravity with itſelf, it ſhoots off
horizontally, and forms a large track in the
air, according to the direction of the wind;
which, happily for us, carried it exactly to the
ſide oppoſite to that where we were placed.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0195500109:162"/>
The crater is ſo hot, that it is very dangerous,
if not impoſſible, to go down into it; beſides,
the ſmoke is very incommodious, and, in
many places, the ſurface is ſo ſoft, there have
been inſtances of people ſinking down in it,
and paying for their temerity with their lives.
Near the centre of the crater is the great mouth
of the volcano. . . . When we arrived at the
foot of the cone, we obſerved ſome rocks of
an incredible ſize, that have been diſcharged
from the crater. The largeſt that has been
obſerved from Veſuvius, is a round one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twelve feet in diameter. Theſe are much
greater; indeed almoſt in proportion of the
mountains to each other.'</p>
                  <p>As all that region from the top of Aetna, to
the diſtance of two leagues below, preſents an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
ſurface, without hills or valleys, and as the
ruins of Empedocles the philoſopher's tower,
who lived four hundred years before the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
aera, are ſtill to be ſeen, it is probable, that,
during all this period, the great crater has made
few or no eruptions. Hence the force of the
fire has diminiſhed, as it no longer acts with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
at the ſummit, and as all the modern e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
have happened in the lower regions of
the mountain. However, within theſe few cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,
the dimenſions of the great crater have
been often changed, as appears from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurements
of Sicilian authors at different periods.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0195500109:163"/>
Sometimes it falls down, and is again gradually
elevated till it falls afreſh. The firſt of theſe
fallings, which are well atteſted, happened in the
year 1157, a ſecond in 1329, a third in 1444,
and the laſt in 1669. But, from theſe facts we
ſhould not conclude, as Mr Brydone has done,
that the crater will ſoon ſuffer another overthrow.
The notion, that this effect ſhould be produced
every hundred years, ſeems to have no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I ſhould rather imagine, that, as the fire
no longer acts with violence at the ſummit, its
force has diminiſhed, and will continue to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh,
in proportion as the ſea retires: It has
already retired ſeveral miles by the action of the
volcano, which has formed large banks and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks
by vaſt torrents of lava. Beſides, we
know, from the diminiſhed rapidity of Scylla
and Charybdis, and ſeveral other indications, that
the Sicilian ſea has ſunk conſiderably within
theſe two thouſand five hundred years. We may,
therefore, conclude that this ſea will continue to
ſink, and, of courſe, that the action of the
neighbouring volcano's will not relax; ſo that
the crater of Aetna may remain during a long
time in its preſent ſtate; and, if ever it falls
back into the gulf, it will probably be for the
laſt time. I farther preſume, that Aetna ought
to be regarded as one of the primitive moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
on account of its height and the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of its ſize, and that it began to act at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0195500109:164"/>
period when the waters firſt retreated.
Its action, however, ceaſed after this retreat, and
was not renewed till that modern period when
the Mediterranean ſea, being elevated by the
rupture of the Boſphorus and the Straits of
Gibraltar, deluged the land between Sicily and
Italy, and approached to the baſis of Aetna. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the firſt of theſe eruptions is ſtill poſterior
to this epoch of Nature. 'It is evident,' Mr
Brydone remarks, 'that Aetna did not burn in
the days of Homer, nor for a long time before,
otherwiſe it would have been impoſſible that
this poet ſhould have talked ſo much of Sicily,
without mentioning an object ſo aſtoniſhing.'
This remark of Mr Brydone is extremely juſt;
and, of courſe, the firſt known eruptions of Aetna
ſhould be dated after the age of Homer. But
we perceive, from the poetical alluſions of Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
and Virgil, and from the deſcriptions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and modern authors, that, in the ſpace of
eighteen or nineteen centuries, the whole face
of this mountain and of the adjacent country
has been changed by earthquakes, eruptions, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of lava, and the formation of hills and
gulfs by theſe commotions. For the facts above
related I am indebted to Mr Brydone's excellent
performance; and I have too high an eſteem
for Mr Brydone to believe that he can be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
becauſe I do not agree with him as to the
force of volcano's, and ſome other concluſions
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0195500109:165"/>
he has drawn from theſe facts. No preceding
author has obſerved with equal acuteneſs, or
preſented ſuch lively pictures of the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>jects he
ſurveyed; the whole republic of letters, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ought to unite in celebrating a work ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of praiſe.</p>
                  <p>Torrents of glaſs in fuſion, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the denomination of lavas, are not the firſt
effects of eruptions. Theſe eruptions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
announced by an earthquake more or leſs
violent, which is the firſt effort of the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
fire to eſcape from the bowels of the earth:
It ſoon, however, opens a paſſage, which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
by projecting rocks and every other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to its motion. Theſe materials, which
are exploded to a great height, fall back upon
each other, and form an eminence more or leſs
conſiderable in proportion to the duration and
violence of the eruption. As all the rejected
matters are penetrated by fire, and moſt of them
converted into burning aſhes, the eminence to
which they give riſe is a mountain of ſolid fire,
in which a great part of the matter is melted by
the fervency of the heat. This melted matter
ſoon begins to run, and generally flows to the
foot of the new mountain by which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
But, in ſmall volcano's, which have not
force ſufficient to throw the ejected matters to a
great diſtance, the lava iſſues from the top of the
mountain. This effect is conſpicuous in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0195500109:166"/>
of Veſuvius. The lava riſes in the
centre of the crater. The volcano firſt throws
out ſtones and aſhes, which fall perpendicularly
back into the old crater and augments its ſize.
It is through this additional matter, which has
fallen back, that the lava opens a paſſage. Theſe
two effects, though different in appearance, are
nevertheleſs the ſame; for, in a ſmall volcano,
which, like Veſuvius, has not force enough to
give birth to new mountains by projecting its
materials to a diſtance, the whole fall back upon
the ſummit and increaſe its height; and it is at
the foot of this new crown of matter that the
lava forces its way and flows down the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
This laſt effort is generally ſucceeded by
a repoſe of the volcano. The ſuccuſſions of the
earth within, and the projections without, ceaſe
as ſoon as the lava flows. But the torrents of
this glaſs in fuſion produce effects ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
and diſaſtrous than the convulſions of the
mountain during an eruption. Theſe rivers of
fire ravage, deſtroy, and disfigure the ſurface of
the earth. Nothing can oppoſe their dreadful
progreſs. Of this the unfortunate inhabitants
of Catania have had fatal experience. As their
city had often been deſtroyed, either wholly or
in part, by theſe torrents of lava, they built very
ſtrong walls of fifty-five feet in height. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by theſe ramparts, they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be ſafe. The walls, it is true, reſiſted the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0195500109:167"/>
heat and the weight of the torrent. But this
reſiſtance ſerved only to dam up the lava, which
roſe above the ramparts, fell back upon the city,
and ravaged ever thing in its progreſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe torrents of lava are often half a league,
and ſometimes even two leagues broad.</p>
                  <p>'The laſt lava we croſſed before our arrival at
Catania, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhould have done with it; it certainly is not
leſs than ſix or ſeven miles broad, and appears
in many places to be of an enormous depth.'</p>
                  <p>'When we came near the ſea, I was deſirous
to ſee what form it had aſſumed in meeting
with the water. I went to examine it, and
found it had driven back the waves for upwards
of a mile, and had formed a large black high
promontory, where before it was deep water.
This lava, I imagined, from its barrenneſs, for
it is as yet covered with a very ſcanty ſoil, had
run from the mountain only a few ages ago;
but was ſurpriſed to be informed by Signior
Recupero, the hiſtoriographer of Aetna, that
this very lava is mentioned by Diodorus Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
to have burſt from Aetna in the time of
the ſecond Punic war, when Syracuſe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
by the Romans. A detachment was
ſent from Taurominum to the relief of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.
They were ſtopped on their march
by this ſtream of lava, which having reached
the ſea before their arrival at the foot of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0195500109:168"/>
mountain, had cut off their paſſage; and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to return by the back of Aetna, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of 100 miles about. His authority for
this, he tells me, was taken from inſcriptions
on Roman monuments found on this lava,
and that it was likewiſe well aſcertained by
many of the old Sicilian authors. Now, as
this is about 2000 years ago, one would have
imagined, if lavas have a regular progreſs in
becoming fertile fields, that this muſt long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
have become at leaſt arable; this however
is not the caſe, and it is as yet only covered
with a very ſcanty vegetation, and incapable
of producing either corn or vines. There are
indeed pretty large trees growing in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which are full of a rich earth; but in
all probability it will be ſome hundred years
yet, before there is enough of it to render this
land of any uſe to the proprietors.'</p>
                  <p>'We paſſed the river Alcantara on our way
to Piedmonte, over a large bridge built entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of lava; and near to this the bed of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is continued for a great way, through
one of the moſt remarkable, and probably one
of the moſt ancient lavas that ever run from
Aetna. In many places the current of the river,
which is extremely rapid, has worn down the
ſolid lava to the depth of 50 or 60 feet. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupero,
the gentleman I have mentioned, who
is engaged in writing the natural hiſtory of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0195500109:169"/>
Aetna, tells me, he had examined this lava

courſe, including all its windings, is not leſs
than 40 miles. It iſſued from a mountain on
the north ſide of Aetna, and finding ſome val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
that lay to the eaſt, it took its courſe that
way, interrupting the Alcantara in many
places, and at laſt arrived at the ſea not far

                  <p>'The city of Jaci or Aci, and indeed all the

that theſe flaming torrents, as ſoon as
they arrived at the ſea, were hardened into

and ſucceeded by a third, and ſo on. . . . The
road from Jaci to this city is entirely over la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,
and conſequently very fatiguing and
troubleſome. Within a few miles of that
place, we counted eight mountains formed by
eruptions, with every one its crater, from
whence t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of theſe are very high, and of a great compaſs.
It appears evidently, that the eruptions of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0195500109:170"/>
Mount Aetna have formed the whole of this
coaſt, and in many places have driven back
the ſea for ſeveral miles from its ancient boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary. . .
At Catania, near to a vault, which is
now thirty feet below ground, and has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
been a burial place, there is a draw-well,
where there are ſeveral ſtrata of lavas, with
earth to a conſiderable thickneſs over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of each ſtratum. Recupero has made uſe
of this as an argument to prove the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of the eruptions of his mountain. For
if it requires two thouſand years or upwards
to form but a ſcanty ſoil on the ſurface of a
lava, there muſt have been more than that
ſpace of time betwixt each of the eruptions
which have formed theſe ſtrata. But what
ſhall we ſay of a pit they ſunk near to Jaci, of
a great depth? They pierced through ſeven
diſtinct lavas one under the other, the ſurfaces
of which were parallel, and moſt of them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a thick bed of rich earth. Now,
ſays he, the eruption which formed the loweſt
of theſe lavas, if we may be allowed to reaſon
from analogy, muſt have flowed from the
mountain at leaſt 14,000 years ago. . . .'</p>

pretend) perforated it from ſide to ſide: This
however I doubt, as it muſt have broken the
regular form of the mountain, which is not
the caſe. But certain it is, that it pierced it
to a greath depth. The lava then divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two branches; and ſurrounding this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
joined again on its ſouth ſide; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
waſte the whole country betwixt that and
Catania, ſcaled the walls of that city, and
poured its flaming torrent into the ocean. In
its way, it is ſaid to have deſtroyed the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of near 30,000 people, and reduced them
to beggary. It formed ſeveral hills where
there were formerly valleys, and filled up a
large lake, of which there is not now the leaſt
veſtige to be ſeen. . . . There is no part of the
coaſt from Catania to Syracuſe nearer than
thirty miles to its ſummit; and yet there has
hardly been any great eruption, where the
lava has not reached the ſea, and driven back
its waters to a great diſtance, leaving high
rocks and promontories, that for ever ſet its
waves at defiance, and preſcribe their utmoſt
limits. What a tremendous ſcene muſt the

formed?'</p>

had ever been eſteemed at thirty of thoſe miles;
an abſurdity in computation that had put him
upon making this inquiry. The reſult was,
that taking the ſuppoſed diſtances of one place

heights, valleys, hills, and even pretty large
mountains. But, as almoſt the whole of theſe
inequalities are covered with a great thickneſs
of earth, and as a long ſucceſſion of time was
neceſſary to convert volcanic matters into vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſoil, we ſhould regard the ſummit of Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
and the other mouths which ſurround it to
the diſtance of ſour or five leagues, as volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's
almoſt extinct, or, at leaſt, ſtifled for a
number of ages; for all the cruptions, the dates
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0195500109:174"/>
of which can be aſcertained for two thouſand
five hundred years, have happened in the lower
region, <hi>i. e.</hi> five, ſix, or ſeven leagues diſtant
from the ſummit. The volcano's of Sicily ſeem
to have had two different ages: The firſt very
ancient, when the ſummit of Aetna began to act,
and when the univerſal ocean left this ſummit
dry, and ſunk ſome hundreds of fathoms below:
It was at this period that the firſt eruptions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
which produced lava at the ſummit, and
gave riſe to thoſe hills found below in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of foreſts; but afterwards, the waters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to ſink, they totally abandoned this
mountain, as well as all the territories of Sicily
and the adjacent continents. After this total
retreat of the waters, the Mediterranean was
only a lake of a moderate extent, and its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were very diſtant from Sicily, and all the
countries whoſe coaſts it now waſhes. During
all this time, which laſted ſeveral thouſand
years, Sicily was perfectly tranquil: Aetna, and
the other ancient volcano's which ſurround its
ſummit, had ceaſed to act; and it was not till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the augmentation of the Mediterranean by
the waters of the ocean and of the Black ſea,
<hi>i. e.</hi> after the rupture of the ſtraits of Gibraltar
and of the Boſphorus, that the waters attacked
the baſes of the new mountains of Aetna, and
produced thoſe modern eruptions which have
happened ſince the age of Pindar to the preſent
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0195500109:175"/>
time; for this poet is the firſt author who has
taken notice of eruptions of volcano's in Sicily.
Veſuvius was preciſely in the ſame ſituation:
It was long one of the extinguiſhed volcano's of
Italy, which are very numerous; and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
were not renewed till after the waters
of the Mediterranean were increaſed and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the baſes of theſe inflammable mountains.
The memory of the firſt eruptions, and even of
all thoſe which preceded the age of Pliny, was
entirely obliterated. Neither ſhould this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
excite ſurpriſe; for ten thouſand years
have, perhaps, elapſed ſince the general retreat
of the waters to the augmentation of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,
and an equal portion of time from the
firſt eruption of Veluvius till their removal.
All theſe conſiderations ſeem to prove, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
fires cannot act with violence, unleſs
when they are ſo near the ſea as to receive a
ſhock from a great body of water. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
is confirmed by other phaenomena: Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's
ſometimes throw out great quantities of
water, and likewiſe torrents of bitumen. P. de la
Torré, an able philoſopher, relates, that, on the
10th of March 1755, an immenſe torrent of water
iſſued from the foot of the mountain, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luged
the neighbouring country. This torrent
brought down ſuch a quantity of ſand, that it
covered an extenſive plain. Theſe waters were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ery hot. The ſtones and ſand left on the plain
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0195500109:176"/>
differed not from thoſe found in the ſea. The
torrent of water was immediately followed by
another of inflamed matter, which proceeded
from the ſame opening<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. du Mont Veſuve, par le P. J. M. de la Torré; <hi>Journal étranger, mois Janvier</hi> 1576, <hi>p.</hi> 203.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The ſame eruption, 1755, was preceded,
ſays M. D'Arthenay, by an inflammation ſo
great, that it illuminated more than twenty-four
miles of country along the coaſts of Catania. The
exploſions were ſoon ſo frequent, that, on the
3d of March, we perceived a new mountain in
the top of the old ſummit, in the ſame manner
as lately happened to Veſuvius. Laſtly, the
magiſtrates of Maſcali informed us, that, on the
9th of the ſame month, the exploſions were
terrible; that the whole ſky was darkened with
ſmoke; that, on the approach of night, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to rain a deluge of ſmall ſtones, ſome of
which weighed three ounces, and covered all
the adjacent cantons; that this tremendous rain
continued an hour and quarter, and was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by another of black aſhes, which laſted
the whole night; that next day, about eight
o'clock in the morning, the ſummit of Aetna
threw out a river of water, which, for magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
might be compared to the Nile; that the
moſt ancient and rugged mountains of lava
were in an inſtant converted by this torrent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a vaſt plain of ſand; that the water, which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0195500109:177"/>
fortunately ran not above half a quarter of an
hour, was very hot; that the ſtones and ſand
carried along with it differed not from thoſe of
the ſea; that, after this inundation, there iſſued
from the ſame mouth a ſmall rivulet of fire,
which flowed during twenty-four hours; that,
on the 11th, about a mile below this mouth, a
rent happened through which iſſued a ſtream
of lava, of about a hundred fathoms broad by
two miles in length, and that it continued its
courſe through the country the ſame day in
which M. D'Arthenay wrote this relation<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. des Savans étrangers, imprimés comme ſuite des mem. de l'acad. des ſciences, tom. 4. p. 147.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Let us attend to what Mr Brydon has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
concerning this eruption. 'Part of the
fine foreſts which compoſe the ſecond region
of Aetna was deſtroyed by a very ſingular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
not later than the year 1755. During
an eruption of the volcano, an immenſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of boiling water iſſued, as is imagined,
from the great crater of the mountain, and in
an inſtant poured down to its baſe; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
and ruining every thing it met with
in its courſe. Our conductors ſhewed us the
traces of this torrent, which are ſtill very viſible;
but are now beginning to recover verdure and
vegetation, which for ſome time appeared to
have been loſt. The track it has left ſeems
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0195500109:178"/>
to be about a mile and a half broad; and in
ſome places ſtill more.'</p>
                  <p>'The common opinion, I find, is, that this
water was raiſed by the power of ſuction,
through ſome communication betwixt the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano
and the ſea; the abſurdity of which is
too glaring to need a refutation. The power
of ſuction alone, even ſuppoſing a perfect va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,
could never raiſe water to more than
thirty-three or thirty-four feet, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the weight of a column of air the whole
height of the atmoſphere.'</p>
                  <p>I muſt here obſerve, that Mr Brydone ſeems
to have deceived himſelf; for he confounds the
force ariſing from the weight of the atmoſphere
with the force of ſuction produced by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fire. The force of the air, when a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum
is made, is indeed limited to thirty-four
feet. But the force of ſuction by fire has no
limits: It is always proportioned to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and intenſity of the heat by which it is
produced, as is evident from the common ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of blaſt furnaces. Hence the opinion of
the <hi>enlightened people of the country,</hi> inſtead of
being abſurd, ſeems to be well founded. It is
neceſſary that the cavities of volcano's ſhould
communicate with the ſea: Without this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
ſuch immenſe torrents of water
could not be thrown out, nor indeed could any
eruption ever happen; for no power, except
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0195500109:179"/>
the ſhock produced by the mingling of fire and
water, could give riſe to ſuch violent effects.</p>
                  <p>The volcano of Pacayita, called the <hi>water vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano</hi>
by the Spaniards, in all its eruptions,
throws out torrents of water. The laſt erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the year 1773, deſtroyed the city of
Guatimala, and the torrents of water and lava
deſcended to the South Sea.</p>
                  <p>With regard to Veſuvius, it has been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a wind, which blows from the ſea, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates
into the mountain. The noiſe it makes
in certain cavities is heard, as if ſome torrent
paſſed below: This noiſe ceaſes whenever the
land winds blow, and, at the ſame time, the
exhalations from the mouth of Veſuvius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
leſs conſiderable. But, when the wind
blows from the ſea, this noiſe which reſembles
that of a torrent, recommences, and the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of flame and ſmoke increaſe. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the ſea, by thus inſinuating itſelf into the
mountain, ſometimes in greater, and ſometimes
in ſmaller quantities, is the reaſon why this vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano
has often thrown out both aſhes and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcript. hiſtorique et philoſ. de Veſuve, par M. l'Abbé Mecatti; <hi>journal étranger, mois Oct.</hi> 1754.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The learned M. D'Arthenay, who has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the modern with the ancient ſtate of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius,
relates, that, during the interval which
preceded the eruption 1631, the funnel or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0195500109:180"/>
of the mountain was covered with trees and
verdure; that the ſmall plain which bounds it
produced excellent paſture; that, in departing
from the ſuperior margin of the crater, we have
a mile to deſcend before we arrive at this plain,
in the middle of which was another gulf. We
deſcended this gulf about a mile, by narrow
and winding roads of an equal dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivity, which
led into a vaſt ſpace ſurrounded with caverns,
from whence there iſſued <hi>winds ſo impetuous
and ſo cold, that it was impoſſible to endure them.</hi>
According to the ſame obſerver, the ſummit of
Veſuvius was then five miles in circumference.
We ſhould not, therefore, be ſurpriſed, that
ſome philoſophers have maintained that what
ſeems now to be two mountains, was formerly
one; that the volcano was in the center, but
that the ſouth ſide, having fallen by the force
of ſome eruption, produced the valley which
ſeparates Veſuvius from Mount <hi>Somma</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Obſerv. ſur le Veſuve, par M. d'Arthenay; <hi>Journal de Savans étrangers, tom.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 147.</note>.</p>
                  <p>M. Steller remarks, that the volcano's in the
north of Aſia are almoſt always <hi>iſolated</hi>; that they
have nearly the ſame ſurface; and that there are
always lakes on the ſummits, and hot waters at
the foot of thoſe mountains whoſe volcano's are
extinct. This, he adds, is a farther proof of
the correſpondence eſtabliſhed by Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſea, mountains, volcano's, and hot
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0195500109:181"/>
waters. We find many ſprings of hot water in
different parts of Kamtſchatka<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 238.</note>. In the iſland
of Sjanw, forty leagues diſtant from Ternate,
there is a volcano, which often throws out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
aſhes<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. tom. 17. p. 54.</note>, &amp;c. But it is unneceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate
more facts to prove the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of volcano's with the ſea. The violence
of their eruptions would be ſufficient to juſtify
the preſumption; and the general fact, that all
acting volcano's are ſituated near the ſea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes
the demonſtration. However, as ſome
philoſophers have denied the reality and even
the poſſibility of this communication of volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's
with the ſea, I ſhall mention another fact
related by M. de la Condamine, a man equally
enlightened as worthy of credit. 'On the 14th
of June 1755,' he remarks, 'I mounted to
the ſummit of Veſuvius, and even to the brink
of the funnel formed round the mouth of the
volcano by its laſt exploſion; and I perceived
in the gulf, about forty fathoms deep, a
great cavity reſembling a vault toward the
north of the mountain. I threw down large
ſtones into this cavity, and counted twelve
ſeconds before the noiſe of their rolling cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
At the end of their fall I heard a noiſe
ſimilar to that of a ſtone falling into a mire;
and, when nothing was thrown in, I heard a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0195500109:182"/>
noiſe like that of agitated waves<note n="†" place="bottom">Voyage en Italie, par. M. de la Condamine; <hi>Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année</hi> 1757, <hi>p.</hi> 371.</note>.' If the
fall of the ſtones had been perpendicular, and
met with no obſtacle, twelve ſeconds would
have given a depth of 2160 feet, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the gulf would, on this ſuppoſition, be
deeper than the level of the ſea; for, according
to le P. de la Torré, in 1753 this mountain
was only 1677 feet above the ſurface of the ſea,
and this elevation has been diminiſhed ſince
that period. Hence we may conclude, that the
caverns of this volcano deſcend below the level
of the ſea, and, of courſe, they may have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
communications.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th of July 1753, I received, from
an eye-witneſs, and an accurate obſerver, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
detail of the then condition of Veſuvius.
I ſhall ſubjoin it in the words of the author, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it will tend to fix our ideas concerning
what is to be farther apprehended from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this volcano, the force of which ſeems
to be greatly diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>'Having arrived at the foot of the mountain,
which is about two leagues diſtant from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
we mounted during an hour and a half
upon aſſes, and an equal portion of time was
employed in completing the journey on foot.
This is the ſteepeſt and moſt fatiguing part of
the way. We held by the belts of two men
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0195500109:183"/>
who went before, and we climbed among aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and ſtones formerly exploded.'</p>
                  <p>'In our aſcent, we ſaw the lavas of different
eruptions. The moſt ancient, whoſe age is
uncertain, but tradition aſſigns it two hundred
years, is of an iron-gray colour, and has all
the appearance of a ſtone: It is uſed for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſtreets of Naples, and in other works
of maſonry. We found others, which were
ſaid to be ſixty, forty, and twenty years old.
The laſt was thrown out in the year 1752. . .
Theſe different lavas, except the moſt ancient,
when viewed at a diſtance, have the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a blackiſh brown rugged earth, more
or leſs recently laboured. When viewed near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
it is a matter perfectly ſimilar to the refuſe
of iron founderies. It is more or leſs compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of earth and ferruginous matter, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
more or leſs to the nature of ſtone.'</p>
                  <p>'When arrived at the top, which before the
eruption was ſolid, we find the firſt baſin,
whoſe circumference is ſaid to be two Italian
miles, and its depth appears to be about forty
feet. It is ſurrounded with a cruſt of earth,
which gradually thickens toward the baſe, and
its upper margin is two feet broad. The bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of this baſin is covered with a greeniſh
yellow ſulphureous matter, which is hard and
warm, but does not burn; and ſmoke iſſues
through different ſiſſures.'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0195500109:184"/>
'In the centre of this baſin, we ſee a ſecond,
which is about half the circumference and half
the depth of the former. Its bottom is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a blackiſh brown matter, ſimilar to
the freſheſt lavas we find on the road.'</p>
                  <p>'In the ſecond baſin, there is a ſmall mount
which is hollow internally, open at the top,
and likewiſe open from the top to the baſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that ſide of the mountain where we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.
This lateral opening is about twenty
feet broad at the top, and four feet at the baſe.
The height of this ſmall mount is about forty
feet; the diameter of the baſe is about as
much, and that of the opening at the top a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty feet.'</p>
                  <p>'This baſe riſes about twenty feet above the
ſecond baſin, and forms a third baſin, which
is filled with a liquid and burning matter, and
has a perfect reſemblance to the melted metal
in an iron furnace. This matter perpetually
boils with great violence. Its movements have
the appearance of a lake moderately agitated,
and the noiſe it produces is ſimilar to that of
waves.'</p>
                  <p>'Every minute, quantities of this matter are
projected into the air, like water thrown up
by many jets-d'eaux. Theſe projections pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the appearance of burning ſheafs of
wheat, which riſe to the height of thirty or
forty feet, and fall back in various curves,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0195500109:185"/>
partly into their own baſin, and partly
the ſecond, which is covered with a black
matter. It is the reflected light of theſe
burning jets which is ſeen from Naples du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the night. The noiſe they make in
their elevation and fall ſeems to be compoſed
of that of fire-works, and the noiſe produced
by the waves of the ſea, when violently daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt a rock.'</p>
                  <p>'The boilings and jets produce a perpetual
evacuation of this matter. Through the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of four feet, at the baſe of the ſmall
mount, a burning rivulet of the ſame dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
with the aperture continually ſlows, and
deſcends in an inclined canal, and with a mean
movement, into the ſecond baſin, where, after
dividing into ſeveral rills, it ſtops and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.'</p>
                  <p>'This burning rivulet conſiſts of freſh lava,
which runs only eight days. But, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to augment, it will in time produce a
new overflowing into the plain, ſimilar to that
which happened two years ago. The whole
is accompanied with a thick ſmoke, which has
not the odour of ſulphur, but preciſely that
which proceeds from a furnace where tiles
are roaſted.'</p>
                  <p>'We may, without danger, go round the
margin of the crater; becauſe the little hollow
mount, from which the burning projections
are made, is ſufficiently diſtant to prevent all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0195500109:186"/>
apprehenſions. We may alſo, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
deſcend into the firſt baſin; we may even
go upon the margin of the ſecond, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation
of the burning matter does not
prevent us.'</p>
                  <p>'This was the real ſtate of Veſuvius on the
15th of July 1753. But it perpetually chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
its form and aſpect. It now throws out
no ſtones, and we perceive no flame<note n="*" place="bottom">Note ſent to M. de Buſſon from Naples in September 1753.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſervations ſeem to prove, that the ſeat
of the burning in this volcano, and perhaps in
all others, is at no great depth in the bowels of the
mountain, and that it is not neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their fires on a level with, or lower than
the ſea, and to make their exploſions from
thence during the time of eruptions. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that there are caverns and perpendicular
fiſſures below, or rather at the ſide of the fire,
which ſerve as ventilators to the furnace of the
volcano.</p>
                  <p>M. de la Condamine, who has had more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
than any other philoſopher, of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a number of volcano's in the Cordelieres,
has likewiſe explored that of Veſuvius, and all
the adjacent territories.</p>
                  <p>'In the month of June 1755,' he remarks,
'the ſummit of Veſuvius formed an open fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
in a maſs of aſhes, calcarious ſtones, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0195500109:187"/>
ſulphur, which burned at different diſtances,
and tinged the ſurface with its colour. The
fire ſtreamed through different crevices, in
which the heat was ſo great, that, in a ſhort
time, it inflamed a ſtick thruſt ſome feet down
theſe fiſſures.'</p>
                  <p>'For ſeveral years paſt, the eruptions of this vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano
have been frequent; and, every time flames
and liquid matter were thrown out the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
underwent conſiderable changes both in
its height and external figure. . . . In a ſmall
plain, on the ſide of the mountain compoſed
of aſhes and ſtones projected from the volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
there is a breaſt of ſteep ſemicircular rocks
of two hundred feet high, which bound this
plain on the north. We perceived, near the
crevices recently opened in the flanks of the
mountain, the places through which the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of lava, with which the whole of this
valley is filled, had iſſued during the laſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.'</p>
                  <p>'This ſpectacle preſents the appearance of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallic
waves cooled and congealed. We may
form an imperfect idea of it by imagining a
ſea of thick and tenacious matter, the waves of
which had begun to calm. This ſea has its
iſlands: They are detached maſſes, like hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſpongy rocks, whimſically interſperſed
with vaults and grotto's, under which the
burning liquid had made a kind of reſervoirs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0195500109:188"/>
reſembling furnaces. From theſe grotto's,
with their vaults and pillars, hang numbers of
ſcoriae in the form of irregular grapes of all
ſhades and colours. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'All the mountains and coaſts in the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
of Naples, are nothing but maſſes of burnt
matter thrown out by volcano's which now no
longer exiſt, and whoſe eruptions, which have
been anterior to all hiſtory, probably formed
the ports of Naples and Puzzoli. The ſame
matters are conſpicuous on the whole road
from Naples to Rome, and even at the port
of Rome itſelf.'</p>
                  <p>'The whole interior part of Mount Fraſcati,
the chain of hills which extends from this place
to Grotta-ferrata, Caſtlegandolfo, and as far
as lake Albano, a great part of Mounts Tivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,
Caprarola, Viterbe, &amp;c are compoſed of
calcined ſtones, of pure aſhes, of ſcoriae, of
matter ſimilar to the droſs of iron and burnt
earth, and of real lava; laſtly, the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
reſemble thoſe of which the ſoil of Portici
is compoſed, and which have iſſued from the
ſides of Veſuvius in ſo many different forms.
. . . Hence we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that
all this part of Italy has been overturned by vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'Lake Albano, whoſe margins are interſperſed
with calcined matters, is nothing but the mouth
of an ancient volcano. . . . The chain of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0195500109:189"/>
volcano's extends as far as Sicily, and
ſtill exhibits a number of fires under different
forms; in Tuſcany, we have the exhalations of
Firenzuola, and the warm waters of Piſa; in
the Eccleſiaſtic ſtate, thoſe of Viterbe, of
Norcia, of Nocera, &amp;c.; in the kingdom of
Naples, thoſe of Iſchia, Solfatara, and Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;
in Sicily and the iſlands adjacent to Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
the volcano's of Lipari, Stromboli, &amp;c.
The other volcano's of this chain have been
extinct from time immemorial, and have left
ſuch relicks as, though they do not always
ſtrike us at firſt ſight, fail not to be recogniſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
on an attentive examination<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage en Italie, par M. de la Condamine; Acad. des Sciences, année 1757, p. 371.—379.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>'It is very probable, ſays M. l'Abbé Mecati,
that, in paſt ages, the kingdom of Naples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Veſuvius, was infeſted with ſeveral other
volcano's.'</p>
                  <p>'Mount Veſuvius,' le P. de la Torré remarks,
ſeems to be a portion detached from that chain
of mountains which, under the name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennines,</hi>
divides all Italy through its whole
length. . . . . This volcano is compoſed of
three different mountains, one of them is Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius
properly ſo called; the other two are
Mounts Somma and Otajano. The two laſt
are ſituated toward the weſt, and form a kind
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0195500109:190"/>
of ſemicircle round Veſuvius, with which they
have a common baſe.'</p>
                  <p>'This mountain was formerly ſurrounded
with fertile fields, and itſelf covered with trees
and verdure, except the ſummit, which was
flat and ſterile, and where ſeveral open ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
were to be ſeen. The top was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with rocks, which rendered it of difficult
acceſs. Theſe rocks were ſo high, that they
concealed the valley between Veſuvius and
Mounts Somma and Otajano. The ſummit
of Veſuvius, which has ſince ſunk conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
being then much more remarkable, it is
not ſurpriſing that the ancients believed it had
only one top. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'The breadth of the valley is 2220 Paris
feet, and its length nearly the ſame. . . .
It inveſts one half of Veſuvius, and, like all
the ſides of the mountain, it is covered with
burnt ſand and ſmall pumice ſtones. The
rocks on Mounts Somma and Otajano ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
a few herbs, and the ſurface of theſe
mountains is covered with trees and verdure.
Theſe rocks, at firſt ſight, have the appearance
of burnt ſtones; but, on a cloſer examination,
they are, like the rocks of other mountains,
compoſed of ſtrata of natural ſtones, of a
cheſnut coloured earth, of chalk, and of white
ſtones, which have not the ſmalleſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of having been liquified by fire. . .'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0195500109:191"/>
'Round Veſuvius we ſee openings which
have been made at different times, and through
which lavas had iſſued. Theſe torrents of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter, which ſometimes come from the
ſides, and ſometimes from the top of the
mountain, deſcend into the plains, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
run as far as the ſea, and harden like a
ſtone when the matter cools. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'On the ſummit of Veſuvius there is only a
ſmall margin of four or five palms wide, and
deſcribes a circumference of 5624 Paris feet.
Upon this margin we can walk pretty commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly.
The whole of it is covered with
burnt ſand, under which we find ſtones part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
natural and partly calcined. . . . In
two elevations on this margin, we find beds
of natural ſtones, arranged in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as in other mountains; which confutes
the notion of thoſe who regard Veſuvius as a
mountain gradually raiſed above the plain of
the valley. . .'</p>
                  <p>'The depth of the gulf where the matter
boils is about 543 feet; and the height of the
mountain above the level of the ſea is 1677
feet, which is one third of an Italian mile.'</p>
                  <p>'This height has been more conſiderable.
The eruptions which have changed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
form of the mountain, have likewiſe
diminiſhed its elevation; for the parts they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0195500109:192"/>
detached from the ſummit rolled into the
gulf<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. du Mont Veſuve, par le P. de la Torré; <hi>Journal é<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranger, Janvier</hi> 1756, <hi>p.</hi> 182.—208.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>From all theſe examples, if we conſider the
external figure of Sicily and other countries ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged
by fire, we ſhall evidently perceive that
no volcano exiſts which is purely iſolated or
detached. The ſurface of theſe countries every
where preſents a ſucceſſion and ſometimes
groups of volcano's. This we have already
ſeen with regard to Aetna, and ſhall give a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
example of it in Hecla. A great part of
the iſland, like Sicily, is only a group of volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's,
which I ſhall prove by the following
obſervations.</p>
                  <p>The whole iſland ought be regarded as a
vaſt mountain interſperſed with deep cavities,
concealing in its bowels great quantities of
minerals, vitrified and bituminous ſubſtances,
and riſing from the midſt of the ſea in the form
of a ſhort flattened cone. Its ſurface preſents
to the eye nothing but tops of mountains co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with ſnow and ice; and lower down we
have the picture of confuſion and ruin. It
is an enormous maſs of ſtones and fragments
of rocks, which are ſometimes porous and half
calcined, and exhibit a hideous appearance by
their blackneſs and the marks of fire impreſſed
upon them. The fiſſures and hollows of rocks
are filled with a red, and ſometimes with a black
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0195500109:193"/>
or white ſand: But, in the valleys between the
mountains, we find agreeable plains<note n="*" place="bottom">Introd. a l'Hiſt. du Denemarck.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of Jokuts, which are mountains of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
height, and overtopped by others of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
elevation, are volcano's that occaſionally
throw out flames, and produce earthquakes:
Of theſe there are no leſs than twenty in this
iſland. The inhabitants in the neighbourhood
of theſe mountains have learned by experience
and obſervation, that, when the ice and ſnow
riſe to a conſiderable height, and ſtop the
mouths of theſe cavities, which formerly
diſcharged flames, that earthquakes are about
to happen, which are always ſucceeded by erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of fire. It is for this reaſon that the Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
are at preſent afraid leſt the Jokuts,
which, in the year 1728, threw out flames in
the canton of Skaftfield, ſhould ſoon be again
inflamed; the ice and ſnow being accumulated on
their ſummits, and appearing to obſtruct thoſe
vents which favoured the exhalations of the
ſubterraneous fires.</p>
                  <p>In 1721, the Jokut called Koëtlegan, about
five or ſix leagues to the weſt of the ſea, near
the bay of Portland, broke out into flames, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeveral ſuccuſſions of the earth. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration
melted maſſes of ice of an enormous
thickneſs, and gave riſe to impetuous torrents,
which deluged the country, and carried down
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0195500109:194"/>
to the ſea prodigious quantities of earth, ſand,
and ſtones. The ſolid maſſes of ice, and the
immenſe quantity of earth, ſtones, and ſand,
tranſported by the inundation, ſo loaded the
ſea, that, at half a mile from the coaſt, a ſmall
mountain was formed, which ſtill appeared
above the ſea in the year 1750. We may
form ſome idea of the quantity of matter carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down to the ſea by this inundation, when
we conſider that it was obliged to retreat
twelve miles beyond its former limits.</p>
                  <p>The inundation continued three days; and
it was not till after this period that a perſon
could paſs on foot to the mountains. . . .</p>
                  <p>Hecla, which has always been regarded as
one of the moſt famous volcano's in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
on account of its tremendous eruptions,
is now one of the leaſt dangerous in the iſland.
Mounts Koëtlegan and Krafle have recently
made as great ravages as Hecla did of old. It
has been remarked, that this laſt volcano has
thrown out flames ten times only in the ſpace
of eight hundred years, namely, in the years
1104, 1157, 1222, 1300, 1341, 1362, 1389,
1558, 1636, and, laſtly, in the year 1693.
This eruption commenced on the 13th of
February, and continued to the month of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
following. All the other eruptions laſted
a few months only. From the above dates it
appears, that Hecla made its greateſt ravages
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0195500109:195"/>
in the fourteenth century, having undergone no
leſs than four eruptions; that it remained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
tranquil during the 15th century; and
that it threw out no fire for one hundred and
ſixty years. From this period, there was one
eruption only in the ſixteenth, and two in the
ſeventeenth century. We now perceive in this
volcano neither fire, nor ſmoke, nor exhalations
of any kind. We only find, in ſome ſmall
hollows, as is common in many other parts of
the iſland, boiling water, ſtones, ſand, and
aſhes.</p>
                  <p>In 1726, after a few ſuccuſſions of the earth,
which were felt only in the northern cantons,
Mount Krafle began to throw out, with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
noiſe, ſmoke, flames, aſhes and ſtones. This
eruption continued two or three years, without
doing any damage; becauſe the whole rejected
matter fell back upon the mountain, or round
its baſe.</p>
                  <p>In 1728, the fire communicated with ſome
mountains ſituated near Krafle, which burnt
during ſeveral weeks. When the minerals they
contained were melted, a river of fire ran gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
toward the ſouth into the country below theſe
mountains. This river threw itſelf into a lake
about three leagues from Mount Krafle, and,
by the ſhock of the water, produced a horrible
noiſe, and clouds of vapours. The running of
the lava did not ceaſe till 1729, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0195500109:196"/>
which formed it was probably exhauſted.
The lake was filled with an immenſe quantity
of calcined ſtones, which raiſed its water conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably.
It is about twenty leagues in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and ſituated at an equal diſtance from
the ſea. We ſhall not take notice of the other
volcano's in this iſland; it is ſufficient that we
have mentioned the moſt conſiderable of them<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 18. p. 9. 10. 11.</note>.</p>
                  <p>From this deſcription we perceive, that the
Jokuts of Hecla greatly reſemble the ſecondary
volcano's of Aetna; that, in both, the higheſt
ſummit is tranquil; that the ſummit of Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
is much ſunk; and that probably thoſe of
Aetna and Hecla were formerly higher than they
are at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Though the topography of volcano's in other
parts of the world is not ſo well known as that
of thoſe in Europe, we may, nevertheleſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
from analogy, and the ſimilarity of their
effects, that they reſemble each other in every
reſpect. They are all ſituated in iſlands, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the coaſts of continents. Almoſt the whole
of them are ſurrounded with ſecondary vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's.
Some of them are active, and others
extinguiſhed or quiet. The number of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is greater, even in the Cordelieres, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be the moſt ancient domain of volcano's.
In the ſouth of Aſia, the iſlands of Sonde, the
Moluccas, and Philippines, bear evident marks of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0195500109:197"/>
deſtruction by fire, and are ſtill infeſted with
volcano's. They are likewiſe very frequent in
the iſland of Japan: This country is alſo more
ſubject to earthquakes than any other part of
the globe. In many places of Japan there are
hot fountains. Moſt of the Indian iſlands, and
all the ſeas of theſe eaſtern regions, preſent to
our eyes nothing but peaks and detached ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
which vomit out fire, and deep indented
coaſts, the relicks of ancient continents which
are now no more. Here the mariner often
meets with ports which daily ſink; and even
whole iſlands have been known to diſappear,
and to be ſwallowed up, with their volcano's,
by the waters. The ſeas in China are warm,
which is a proof that there is a great efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
in the maritime baſins of this region.
The hurricanes are tremendous, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouts
are frequent. The tempeſts are always
preceded by general and perceptible boilings of
the waters, and by various meteors and other
exhalations with which the atmoſphere is load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>The volcano of Teneriff has been explored
by Dr Thomas Heberden, who reſided ſeveral
years in the village of Oratava, which is ſituated
at the foot of the Peak. In his way he found
large ſtones diſpoſed on all ſides at ſeveral lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
from the top of the mountain. Some of
them appeared to be entire, and others ſeemed
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0195500109:198"/>
to have been burnt, and thrown to this diſtance
by the volcano. In aſcending the mountain he
ſtill ſaw burnt rocks ſcattered about in large
maſſes.</p>
                  <p>'We arrived,' Dr Heberden remarks, 'at
the famous grotto of Zegds, which is ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on all ſides with enormous maſſes of burnt
rocks. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'A quarter of a league higher, we met with
a ſandy plain, in the middle of which there is
a pyramid of ſand, or yellowiſh aſhes, called
the <hi>Sugar Loaf.</hi> Round its baſe, fuliginous
vapours perpetually ariſe. From thence to the
ſummit, the diſtance might be half a quarter of
a league. But the aſcent is too difficult, on
account of its ſteepneſs and the bad footing. . .'</p>
                  <p>'However, we reached what is called the
<hi>Cauldron</hi> which is twelve or fifteen feet deep.
Its ſides taper to the bottom, and form a cavity
which reſembles a reverſed cone. . . . Here
the ground is very warm; and, from about
twenty tubes or chimneys, a thick ſulphureous
vapour ariſes. The whole ground ſeems to be
mixed with ſulphur, which gives the ſurface
a brilliant appearance. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'Upon almoſt all the ſtones in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
we perceive a greeniſh colour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed

'The mountains of Auvergne,' ſays M. Guet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,

                  <p>'If I found not on this mountain as many
veſtiges of a volcano as in the other two, it
muſt be partly aſcribed to this circumſtance,
that Mount Or is more covered, through its

Mounts Volvic and Puy-de-dôme. . . . How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the ſouth-eaſt part is entirely bare, and

to thoſe of Volvic and Puy-de-dôme. To the
eaſt of this point is the Peak du Capuchin,
which is likewiſe conical, but not ſo regular as
thoſe of the preceding mountains. It even
appears that this peak has undergone more
changes in its ſtructure; for every thing is more
irregular, and broken into ſmaller portions. . .
There are ſtill ſeveral other peaks, the baſes of
which reſt upon the ridge of the mountain; but
they are all overtopped by Mount Or, which
is 509 fathoms high. . . . The peak of Mount

on the top of which they found a mouth
of about 80 feet in diameter. Below this mouth
the lava is partly viſible. It has flowed down
the ravines in great maſſes, for the ſpace of ſeven
or eight thouſand fathoms. The matter has
heaped together while yet burning in certain
places; and, after fixing, it chapped and ſplit
through its whole thickneſs, and left the whole

fifteen to thirty feet long by about ſeven inches

active nor extinguiſhed volcano's, but ſeem to
participate of both. Theſe no man has better

burnt, and the ſtones are blacker than thoſe

here and there, a lively, blue, clear flame,
which riſes from three to four feet high. . . .
But, beyond this circular ſpace, we ſee no fire,

at the diſtance of ſixty feet from the centre

of lavas, and on the time neceſſary for
their cooling and their converſion into vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoil.</p>
                  <p>The lava which runs from the foot of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences
formed by the matters rejected by the
volcano, is an impure glaſs in fuſion. It is a
tenacious, viſcous, and half fluid ſubſtance.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0195500109:217"/>
Hence the torrents of this vitrified matter, when
compared to torrents of water, run ſlowly; and
yet they often proceed to great diſtances. In
theſe torrents of fire, however, there is another
movement than what takes places in thoſe of
water: This movement tends to elevate the
whole running maſs, and is produced by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſive
force of the heat in the interior parts of
the burning torrent. The external ſurface cools
firſt; the liquid fire continues to run below;
and, as heat acts equally on all ſides, the fire,
which endcavours to eſcape, elevates the ſuperior
parts that are already conſolidated, and often
forces them to riſe perpendicularly. This is the
origin of thoſe large maſſes of lava in the form
of rocks, which are found in the courſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every torrent where the declivity is not
great. By the efforts of this internal heat, the
lava makes frequent exploſions; its ſurface opens,
and the liquid matter ſprings up and forms thoſe
maſſes which we ſee elevated above the level of
the to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ent. Le P. de la Torré, I believe, is the
firſt perſon who obſerved this internal movement
of burning lavas, which is always more violent
in proportion to their thickneſs and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the declivity. This effect is common to
all matters liquified by fire, and every man may

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> examples of it in our common founderies<note n="*" place="bottom">The lava of iron founderies exhibits the ſame effects. When this vitreous matter runs ſlowly, and accumulates at the baſe, we ſee eminences ariſe, which are bubbles or concave hemiſpheres of glaſs. Theſe bubbles increaſe, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſive force is great, and the matter has little fluidity: It then ſuddenly explodes into a flame, and makes a conſiderable report. When the liquified matter is ſufficiently adheſive to ſuffer a great dilatation, theſe ſuperficial bubbles acquire a volume of eight or ten inches in diameter, without breaking. When the vitrification is leſs complete, and the matter is viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and tenaceous, the bubbles are ſmaller, and in cooling form concave eminences called <hi>toad's eyes.</hi> What happens in miniature in our ſounderies, is likewiſe exhibited upon a larger ſcale in the lavas of volcano's.</note>.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0195500109:218"/>
If we obſerve thoſe large ingots or maſſes of
melted iron, which run in a mould or canal with
a very ſmall declivity, we ſhall perceive that
they have a tendency to riſe like arches, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the ſtream is very thick<note n="*" place="bottom">I have not mentioned ſome particular cauſes which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produce a curvature or ſwelling in our melted ingots: For example, when the matter is not very fluid, or when the mould is too moiſt, the ingots bend conſiderably; becauſe theſe cauſes concur in augmenting the effect of the firſt. Thus the humidity of the ground, on which the torrents of lava deſcend, and the internal heat concur in raiſing the maſs, and in producing exploſions, which are always accompanied with thoſe jets of matter formerly mentioned.</note>. We have
formerly ſhewn, by experiments, that the time
of conſolidation is always proportioned to the
thickneſs of the ingots, and that, when their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
are hardened, the interior parts ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to be liquid. It is this internal heat which
elevates the ingots and makes them bliſter. If
their thickneſs were greater, there would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
as in the torrents of lava, exploſions, rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0195500109:219"/>
in the ſurface, and perpendicular jets of
metallic mater puſhed out by the action of the
fire incloſed in the interior parts of the
ingots. This explication, drawn from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing itſelf, leaves no doubt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the origin of thoſe eminences ſo frequent
in valleys and plains, which have been over-run
or covered with lava.</p>
                  <p>When, after deſcending from the mountain
and traverſing the fields, the burning lava ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
at the margin of the ſea, its courſe is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
interrupted, the torrent advances, and,
like a powerful enemy, makes the water at firſt
retire: But the water by its immenſity, by the
reſiſtance of its cold, and by its power of arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and extinguiſhing fire, ſoon conſolidates
the torrent of burning matter, which can now
proceed no farther, but riſes up, accumulates
new ſtrata, and forms a perpendicular wall,
from the top of which the lava falls and applies
itſelf to the face of the wall thus formed. It is
this falling and arreſting of the burning matter
that gives riſe to bataltic priſms<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſhall not here inquire into the origin of the term <hi>baſalt,</hi> which M. Deſmarets of the academy of Sciences, a learned na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt, believes to have been applied by the ancients to different kinds of ſtones; but ſhall limit myſelf to the <hi>baſaltic lava,</hi> which appears under the form of priſmatic columns.</note> and their joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
columns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe priſms have generally five,
ſix, or ſeven ſides, ſometimes only three or four,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0195500109:220"/>
and ſometimes eight or nine. The baſaltic co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
are formed by the perpendicular fall of
the lava into the ſea, whether it falls from high
rocks on the ſhore, or from a wall raiſed by its
own accumulations. In both caſes, the cold
and humidity of the water arreſt the burning
matter, and conſolidate its ſurfaces the moment
it falls; and the ſucceſſive bundles or maſſes of
lava apply themſelves to each other. As the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
heat of theſe maſſes tends to dilate them,
a reciprocal reſiſtance is created; and the ſame
effect is produced as happens in the ſwelling of
peaſe, or rather of cylindrical grain, when ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a cloſe veſſel filled with boiling water.
Each of theſe grains would aſſume a hexagonal
figure by reciprocal compreſſion. In the ſame
manner, each bundle or maſs of lava aſſumes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſides by dilatation and reciprocal reſiſtance;
and, when the reſiſtance of the ſurrounding
bundles is ſtronger than the dilatation of the
bundle ſurrounded, inſtead of becoming hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal,
it has only three, four, or five ſides.
But, if the dilatation of the ſurrounded bundle
is ſtronger than the reſiſtance of the ſurrounding
bundles, it aſſumes ſeven, eight, or nine ſides,
which are always longitudinal.</p>
                  <p>The tranſverſe articulations of theſe priſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
columns are produced by a cauſe ſtill more
ſimple: The bundles of lava f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll not in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and continued ſtream, nor in equal maſſes.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0195500109:221"/>
Hence, if there are intervals in the fall of the
matter, the ſuperior ſurface of the forming co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
being partly conſolidated, is hollowed
by the weight of the ſucceeding maſs, which
then moulds itſelf into a convex form in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity
or depreſſion of the firſt. This is the
productive cauſe of thoſe joints or articulations
which appear in the greater part of priſmatic co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns.
But, when the lava falls in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
ſtream, then the baſaltic column is
one continued maſs, without any articulations.
In the ſame manner, when, by an exploſion,
ſome detached maſſes are darted from the torrent
of lava, theſe maſſes aſſume a globular or ellipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
figure, and are even ſometimes twiſted like
cables. To this ſimple explication, all the forms
of baſalts and figured lavas may be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                  <p>It is to the rencounter of lava with the waves,
and its ſudden conſolidation, that the origin of
theſe bold coaſts, which border all the ſeas at
the foot of volcanic mountains, is to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
The ancient ramparts of baſalt found
in the interior parts of continents, ſhow that the
ſea has been in the neighbourhood of theſe vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's
when they had thrown out lava. This
is an a ditional proof of the ancient abode of the
waters upon all the lands now inhabited.</p>
                  <p>The torrents of lava are from a hundred to
two and three thouſand fathoms broad, and
ſometimes one hundred and fifty, and even two
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0195500109:222"/>
hundred feet thick: And, as we have found by
experience, that the time of the cooling of
glaſs is to that of the cooling of iron as
132 to 236, and that the times of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
conſolidation are nearly in the ſame
proportion, it is eaſy to infer, that, to conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the thickneſs of ten feet of glaſs or lava,
201 21/59 minutes would be neceſſary, ſince it
requires 360 minutes to conſolidate ten feet
thick of iron, conſequently it will require
4028 minutes, or 67 hours 8 minutes,
to conſolidate 200 feet thick of lava: By the
ſame rule we ſhall find, that 30 days 17/24, or
a month, will be requiſite before the ſurface of
this lava of two hundred feet thick be ſufficiently
cold to admit of being touched. Hence a year
will be neceſſary to cool a lava of two hundred
feet thick, ſo as to admit of being touched, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
burning, at the depth of one foot; and, at
ten feet deep, it will be ſtill ſo warm, at the end
of ten years, as not to be tangible; and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
will be requiſite to cool it to the ſame
degree in the middle of its thickneſs. Mr
Brydone relates, that, more than four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the lava had flowed, in the year 1766, at the
foot of Aetna, it was not perfectly cool. Maſſa,
a Sicilian author worthy of credit, tells us,
'that, being at Catania, eight years after the
great eruption in 1669, he found, that the
lava in ſeveral places was not entirely
cool<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage an Sicile, tom. 1. p. 213.</note>.'</p>

About the end of April 1771, Sir William
Hamilton dropt pieces of dry wood into a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in the lava at Veſuvius, and they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
inflamed: The lava iſſued from the
mountain on the 19th of October 1767, and
had no communication with the fire of the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano.
The place where this experiment was
made, was at leaſt four miles diſtant from the
mouth from which the lava iſſued. He is firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſuaded, that many years are neceſſary to
cool a lava of this thickneſs (about 200 feet).</p>
                  <p>I have had no opportunity of making experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon conſolidation and cooling, but with
balls of ſome inches in diameter. The only
method of making experiments on a larger ſcale
would be, to obſerve lavas, and to compare the
times exhauſted in their conſolidation and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
according to their different thickneſſes. I am
ſatisfied that theſe obſervations would confirm
the law I have eſtabliſhed for the cooling of
bodies from the ſtate of fuſion to the common
temperature; and although theſe new obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are by no means neceſſary to ſupport my
theory, ſtill they would help to fill up that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
gap between a cannon-ball and a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>
                  <p>It now remains for us to examine the nature
of lava, and to ſhow, that, in time, it is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into fertile earth; which recals the idea of
the firſt converſion of the ſcoriae of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0195500109:224"/>
glaſs that covered the whole ſurface of
the globe after its conſolidation.</p>
                  <p>'Under the denomination of lava, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
not,' ſays M. de la Condamine, 'all
the matter thrown out by a volcano, ſuch
as aſhes, pumice-ſtones, gravel, and ſand; but
ſolely thoſe reduced to a liquid ſtate by the

of marble. This reſtriction notwithſtanding,
many other ſpecies of lava may be conceived,
according to the different degrees of fuſion
in the mixture, the greater or ſmaller quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

union with the various matters. Beſide many
intermediate kinds, three ſpecies are eaſily
diſtinguiſhable. The pureſt lava reſembles,
when poliſhed, a ſtone of an obſcure dirty
gray colour. It is ſmooth, hard, heavy, and
interſperſed with ſmall particles ſimilar to
black marble, and whitiſh points. It ſeems
to contain metallic particles. At firſt ſight,
it reſembles ſerpentine, when the colour of
the lava does not tend to green. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives

                  <p>'The coarſeſt kind of lava is rugged and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even.
It reſembles the ſcoriae or droſs of
iron. The moſt common ſpecies holds a
middle rank between the two extremes:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0195500109:225"/>
It is that which we every where find in large
maſſes upon the ſides of Veſuvius and in
the adjacent fields, where it has run in torrents.
In cooling, it has formed maſſes ſimilar to
ferruginous and ruſty rocks, which are often
many feet thick. Theſe maſſes are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interrupted and covered with aſhes and
calcmed matter. . . . . It is under ſeveral
alternate ſtrata of lava, aſhes, and earth, the
whole of which forms a cruſt of from 60
to 80 feet thick, that temples, porticos, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

diſcovered<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. de. l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1757, p. 374.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>M. Fougeroux de Bondaroy remarks, 'that,

on the ground is flatter: As theſe pieces lie
above each other, they have ſome reſemblance
to the waves of the ſea. When the pieces are
larger and more numerous, they aſſume the
figure of rocks. . .'</p>
                  <p>'In cooling, the lava affects various forms. .
The moſt common is that of tables or boards
of greater or ſmaller dimenſions. Some pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are ſix, ſeven, and eight feet long. It

It is always found near the mouth of the

It is lighter, more brittle, more bituminous,
and ſofter, than the firſt ſpecies. By break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is not ſo cloſe and compact. . .'</p>
                  <p>'At the top of the mountain, we find a third

of lavas. Iron and a ſmall quantity of copper
have been extracted from the lava found on the
ſummit of Veſuvius. Some ſpecimens are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with metallic ſubſtances as to preſerve
the flexibility of metal. I have ſeen two large
tables of lava of two inches thick, which were
poliſhed like marble, and bended with their
own weight. I have ſeen others, which were
bended by a weight, and reſumed their hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal

                  <p>All lavas, when reduced to pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the mixture of duſt and corrupted

apparent from the vaſt and beautiful foreſts
which ſurround Aetna, and grow upon a

Vol. I. p. 442.</head>
               <head>Of Caverns formed by the Primitive Fire.</head>
               <p>IN my theory of the Earth, I mentioned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two kinds of caverns, the one produced
by the fire of volcano's, and the other by the
motion of ſubterraneous waters. Thoſe two
ſpecies of caverns are not ſituated at great depths.
They are even new, when compared with thoſe
vaſt cavities, which were formed at the time the
globe firſt aſſumed a ſolid form; for, at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
all the ſuperſicial eminences and hollows,
and all the cavities in the interior parts of the
earth, eſpecially near the ſurface, were produced.
Several of thoſe caverns produced by the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſire, after being ſupported for ſome time,
have afterwards ſplit by cooling, which diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the volume of every kind of matter; theſe
would ſoon fall in, and, by their ſinking, form
baſins or reſervoirs for the ſea, into which the
waters, formerly much elevated above this level,
ran, and abandoned the lands which they origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0195500109:230"/>
covered. It is more than probable, that
a certain number of theſe ancient caverns ſtill
ſubſiſt in the interior parts of the globe, and by
their ſinking may produce ſimilar effects, and
give riſe to new receptacles to the waters. In
this caſe, they will partly abandon the baſin
which they now occupy, and run, by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
propenſity, into theſe lower places. For
example, we find beds of ſea ſhells in the Pyren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees
1500 fathoms above the preſent level of
the ocean. Hence it is certain, that the waters,
when theſe ſhells were formed, roſe 1500 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
higher than they do at preſent. But,
when the caverns, which ſupported the lands
that are now the bed of the Atlantic ocean,
ſunk, the waters which covered the Pyrennees
and the whole of Europe would run with rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
into theſe reſervoirs, and, of courſe, leave
uncovered all the lands in this part of the world.
The ſame revolution would extend to every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
country. The waters appear to have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reached the ſummits of the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
becauſe they exhibit no relicks of marine
productions, and no ſufficient marks of a long
abode of the waters. However, as ſome of the
matters of which they are compoſed, though all
of the vitreſcent kind, ſeem to have derived
their ſolidity and conſiſtence from the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and cement of water, and as they appear
to have been formed, as already remarked, in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0195500109:231"/>
the maſſes of ſand, or glaſs duſt, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay on the peaks of mountains, but which,
in the progreſs of time, have been carried down
to their bottoms by the rains, we cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
poſitively, that the waters of the ſea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſtood higher than the places where ſhells are
now found: The waters have perhaps ſtood
much higher, even before their temperature
permitted the exiſtence of ſhells. The greateſt
height reached by the univerſal ocean is to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
But we know that the waters were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
from 1500 or 2000 fathoms above their
preſent level; ſince ſhells are found in the
Pyrennees at 1500 hundred fathoms, and in the
Cordelieres at 2000.</p>
               <p>If all the peaks of mountains were formed of
ſolid glaſs, or of other matters immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by fire, it would be unneceſſary to have
recourſe to the abode of the waters, or to any
other cauſe, in order to conceive how they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
their conſiſtence. But moſt peaks of
mountains ſeem to be compoſed of matters,
which, though vitrifiable, have acquired their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
by the intervention of water. We cannot,
therefore, determine whether their conſiſtence
is ſolely owing to the primitive fire, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the intervention and cement of water were
not requiſite to complete the operation of fire, and
to beſtow on theſe vitrifiable maſſes the qualities
which they poſſeſs. Beſides, this ſuppoſition
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0195500109:232"/>
prevents not the primitive fire, which at firſt
produced the greateſt inequalities on the globe,
from being the chief cauſe of thoſe chains of
mountains that traverſe its ſurface, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of their cores or nuclei; but the contours
of theſe ſame mountains have perhaps been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and faſhioned by the waters at a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
period; for it is upon theſe contours, and
at certain heights, that ſhells and other produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſea are found.</p>
               <p>To acquire a clear notion of the ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
formed by the primitive fire, we muſt
ſuppoſe the globe to be deprived of all its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and of all the matters which cover its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
to the depth of ten or twelve hundred
feet. By removing in idea this external bed of
earth and water, the globe will preſent to us the
form it poſſeſſed about the time of its firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation.
The whole maſs was compoſed of
vitreous rock, or, if you will, of melted glaſs;
and this matter, in cooling and acquiring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
produced, like all other melted bodies,
eminences, depreſſions, and cavities, upon the
whole ſurface of the globe. Theſe internal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
formed by fire, are the primitive caverns,
and they are more numerous in the ſouthern
than in the northern regions; becauſe the rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
motion, which elevated the equatorial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
before conſolidation, likewiſe produced
the greateſt derangement of the matter, and, by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0195500109:233"/>
retarding the conſolidation, would concur with
the action of the fire in giving riſe to a greater
number of inequalities in this than in any other
part of the globe. The waters coming from
the Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es could not approach thoſe burning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
before they cooled. The vaults which
ſupported theſe regions having ſucceſſively fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
in, the ſurface ſunk and broke in a thouſand
places. For this reaſon, the greateſt inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the globe are found in the equatorial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions:
There the primitive caverns are more
numerous than in any other part of the earth.
They are likewiſe more profound, <hi>i. e.</hi> perhaps
five or ſix leagues deep; becauſe the matter of
the globe, while in a liquid ſtate, was agitated
to that depth by the motion of rotation. But
all the caverns in high mountains derive not
their origin from the operation of primitive fire.
Thoſe alone which are deeply ſituated below the
mountains can be aſcribed to this cauſe. The
more exterior and more elevated have been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as already remarked, by the operation of
ſecondary cauſes. Hence the globe, deprived
of its waters and the matters tranſported by
them, would preſent to us a ſurface much more
irregular than it appears with the aid of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.
The great chains of mountains and
their peaks and ridges, have not now the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of half of their real height. The
whole are att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

ſhould reckon three ſpecies of caverns produced
by Nature: The firſt by the force of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
fire; the ſecond by the action of water;
and the third by that of ſubterraneous fires:
Each of theſe caverns, though different in their
origin, may be diſtinguiſhed by examining the
matters they contain, or by which they are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded.</p>

ſhall ſubjoin ſome examples.</p>
                  <p>'In the year 1757,' ſays M. Perronet, 'a part
of the ground ſituated about half-way before
we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rive at the Caſtle of Croix-fontaine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in many places, and ſucceſſively tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
down. The terrace wall, which incloſed
this ground, was overturned, and the road,
which was formerly at the foot of the wall,
was obliged to be carried to a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0195500109:236"/>
. . . . This ground reſted upon a baſe
of inclined earth.' This learned and chief
engineer of our highways and bridges mentions
another accident of the ſame kind which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the year 1733, at Pardines, near Iſſoire in
Auvergne. The ground, for about 400 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
in length by 300 in breadth, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a pretty diſtant meadow, with all its
houſes, trees, and herbage. He adds, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
portions of ground are ſometimes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
either by the rupture of reſervoirs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or by the ſudden melting of ſnows. In
1757, at the village of Guet, about ten leagues
from Grenoble, on the road to Briançon, the
whole ground, which lies on a declivity,
ſlipt and deſcended in an inſtant towards Drac,
which is about a mile diſtant. The earth ſplit
in the village, and the part which moved off
was ſix, eight, and nine feet lower than its
former ſtation. This ground was ſituated on a
pretty ſolid rock, which was inclined to the
horizon about forty degrees<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1769, p. 233.</note>.</p>
                  <p>To theſe examples I ſhall add another fact, of
which I have been a conſtant witneſs, and which
has coſt me a conſiderable expence. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
riſing ground, upon which the town and
old caſtle of Montbard are ſituated, is elevated
140 feet above the level of the river, and its
moſt rapid deſcent is to the north-caſt. This
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0195500109:237"/>
riſing ground is crowned with calcarious rocks,
the ſtrata of which, when taken together, are
54 feet thick. They every where reſt upon a
maſs of clay, which, of courſe, before reaching
the level of the river, is 86 feet thick. My
garden, which is ſurrounded with ſeveral ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races,
is ſituated on the top of this riſing ground.
From twenty-five to twenty-ſix fathoms of the
laſt terrace-wall on the north-eaſt ſide, where the
declivity is greateſt, gave way all at once, carrying
along the inferior ground which would have
gradually deſcended to the level of the ground
near the river, if its progreſſive motion had not
been prevented by taking down the whole wall.
This wall was ſeven feet thick and founded on
clay. The movement of the earth was very
ſlow: I perceived that it was evidently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the inſinuation of water. All the
water which falls upon the platform on the top
of this riſing ground, penetrates through the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the rocks, and reaches the clay upon
which they reſt: Of this fact we are aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by two wells dug from the top of the rock
to the clay. All the rain-water, therefore, which
falls upon this platform and the adjacent terraces,
collect upon the clay where the perpendicular
fiſſures of the rock terminate. The water gives
riſe to ſmall rills in different places, which are
rendered ſtill more apparent by ſeveral wells dug
below the rocks. Wherever this maſs of clay is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0195500109:238"/>
cut by ditches, we ſee the water filtrating from
above. It is not, therefore, ſurpriſing that walls,
however ſolid, ſhould ſlip upon this firſt bed of
moiſt clay, if they are not founded much lower,
as I have done in rebuilding them. The ſame
thing, however, has happened on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
ſide, where the declivity is gentler, and no
rills of water appear. The clay had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
at the diſtance of twelve or fifteen feet
from a great wall, of eleven feet thick, thirty-five
feet high, and twelve fathoms long. This wall
is conſtructed of good materials, and has ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more than nine hundred years. The cut
from which the clay was removed, though not
above four or five feet deep, has produced a
movement in this immenſe wall. It declines
from the perpendicular about fifteen inches, and
I could only prevent its downfall by abuttments
of ſeven or eight feet thick, and founded at the
depth of fourteen feet.</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts I drew the following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
which is not ſo intereſting at preſent as
it would have been in ages that are paſt, that
there is not a caſtle or fortreſs ſituated upon
heights, which might not be eaſily tumbled into
the plain by a ſimple cut of ten or twelve feet
deep and ſome fathoms wide. This cut ſhould
be made at a ſmall diſtance from the laſt wall,
and upon that ſide where the declivity is greateſt.
This method, of which the ancients never
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0195500109:239"/>
dreamed, would have ſaved them the operation
of battering-rams and other engines of war;
and, even at preſent, might be employed, in
many caſes, with advantage. I am convinced
by my eyes, that, when theſe walls ſlipt, if the
cut made for rebuilding them had not been
ſpeedily filled with ſtrong maſon-work, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
walls, and the two towers that have ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in good condition nine hundred years, and
one of which is 125 feet high, would have tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
into the valley, along with the rocks upon
which they are founded. As moſt of our hills
compoſed of calcarious ſtones reſt upon a clay
baſe, the firſt ſtrata of which are always more
or leſs moiſtened with the waters that filtrate
through the crevices of the rocks, it appears to
be certain, that, by expoſing theſe moiſtened beds
to the air by a cut, the whole maſs of rocks and
earth reſting upon the clay would ſlip, and in a
few days tumble into the cut, eſpecially during
wet weather. This mode of diſmantling a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
is more ſimple than any hitherto invented;
and experience has convinced me that its ſucceſs
is certain.</p>

                  <head>Of Turf.</head>
                  <p>TO what I have formerly remarked concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turf, I ſhall ſubjoin the following facts:</p>
                  <p>In the juriſdiction of Bergues-Saint-Winock,
Furnes, and Bourbourg, we find turf at three or
four feet below the ſurface. Theſe beds of turf
are generally two feet thick, and are compoſed
of corrupted wood, of entire trees with their
branches and leaves, and particularly of filberds
which are known by their nuts, and the whole
is interlaced with reeds and the roots of plants.</p>
                  <p>What is the origin of theſe beds of turf, which
extend from Bruges through the whole flat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Flanders as far as the river Aa, between
the downs and the high country in the environs
of Bergues? &amp;c. In remote ages, when Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
was only a vaſt foreſt, a ſudden inundation
of the ſea muſt have deluged the whole country,
and, in retiring, depoſited all the trees, wood,
and twigs, which it had eradicated and deſtroyed
in this loweſt territory of Flanders; and this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
muſt have happened in the month of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
or September; becauſe we ſtill find the leaves
of trees, as well as nuts on the filberds. This
inundation muſt have taken place long before
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0195500109:241"/>
that province was conquered by Julius Caeſar,
ſince no mention is made of it in the writings
of the ancients<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. pour la ſubdelegation de Dunkerque, relativement à l'Hiſt. Nat. de ce canton.</note>.</p>

near Compeigne, we find, on one ſide of
the mountain, quarries of fine ſtones and the

all kinds of trees, and alſo reeds, the whole

the ſea; and theſe leaves preſerve their odour
during ſeveral years. Beſides, the leaves are
not deſtroyed; for we can eaſily diſtinguiſh
their ſpecies: They are only dry, and ſlightly
united to each other by the mud<note n="†" place="bottom">Lettre de M. Leſchevin à M. de Buffon; <hi>Compeigne,</hi> S. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>'We diſtinguiſh,' M. Guettard remarks,
two ſpecies of turf: The one is compoſed of
marine, and the other of terreſtrial plants. We
ſuppoſe the firſt to have been formed when
the ſea covered all thoſe parts of the earth
which are now inhabited. The ſecond is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have been ſuperinduced upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
According to this ſyſtem, it is imagined
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0195500109:242"/>
that the currents carried the ſea-plants into the
hollows formed by the mountains, which were
elevated above the waters, and, after being
toſſed about by the waves, were depoſited in
the hollows.'</p>
                  <p>'This origin of turf is not impoſſible: The
great quantity of ſea-plants is ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aenomenon. The Dutch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
alledge, that the goodneſs of their turf is
owing to the bitumen with which the ſea-water
is impregnated, and that they were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſea-weeds. . . . .'</p>

valley through which the river Eſſone runs;
and part of this valley extends from Roiſſy to
Eſcharcon. . . . . It is even near Roiſſy that
turfs were firſt dug. . . . . But thoſe near
Eſcharcon are the beſt. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'The meadows where turf is dug are open
and bad: They are filled with ruſhes, horſe-tail,
and other plants which grow in bad ſoils.
Theſe meadows are dug to the depth of eight
or ten feet. . . . . Next to the upper ſtratum,
there is a bed of turf about a foot thick, and
impregnated with river and land-ſhells. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'This bed of turf filled with ſhells is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
earthy: Thoſe which ſucceed are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the ſame thickneſs, and are always better
as we deſcend. Theſe turfs are of a blackiſh
brown colour, intermixed with reeds, ruſhes,

and other plants. We ſee no ſhells in theſe
beds. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'In maſſes of turf we ſometimes find the
ſtems of willow and poplars, and ſometimes
the roots of theſe and ſimilar trees. On the
Eſcharcon ſide, an oak was diſcovered at the
depth of nine feet. It was black and almoſt
corrupted. It crumbled into duſt, after being
expoſed to the air. Another was found, on the
Roiſſy ſide, between the ſoil and the turf, at
the depth of two feet. Near Eſcharcon, the
horns of a ſtag were found three or four feet
below the ſurface. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'Turfs are perhaps equally abundant in the
environs of Etampes, as near Villeroy. Theſe
turfs contain but very little moſs. Their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is a fine black. They are heavy, and
burn well in an ordinary fire. Good charcoal
might be made of them. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'The turfs in the neighbourhood of Etampes
may be conſidered as a continuation of thoſe
of Villeroy. In a word, all the meadows ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent

they were as beautiful and hard as agates.
Some ſpecimens of them were given by the

                  <p>Wood in its natural ſtate has likewiſe been
found at great depths. M. du Verny, an
officer of artillery, ſent me ſome ſpecimens of

160 feet, they found, at two different trials,
the augre filled with marl, intermixed with
numerous fragments of wood, which every

remarks, 'petrified wood of a prodigious
ſize. In the mountains of Miſnia, entire trees
have been dug out of the earth, which were
converted into very fine agate. The Imperial
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0195500109:246"/>
cabinet of Vienna contains many petrifications
of this kind. A great log of this wood was
ſent to the ſame cabinet: The part which had
been wood was changed into a beautiful agate
of a grayiſh black colour; and, inſtead of bark,
the trunk was ſurrounded with a belt of fine
white agate. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'The preſent Emperor wiſhed that a method
of aſcertaining the age of petrifactions might
be diſcovered. . . . . . He ordered his
ambaſſador at Conſtantinople to aſk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to take up from the Danube one of the
piles of Trajan's bridge, which is ſome miles
below Belgrade. This permiſſion being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
one of the piles was drawn up, which it
was imagined would have been petrified by
the water. But, after ſuch a lapſe of time, it
was diſcovered that the proceſs of petrifaction
had made very little progreſs. Though this
pile had remained in the Danube above 1600
years, the petrifaction had not proceeded above
three quarters of an inch, and even leſs. The
reſt of the wood was very little altered, and
had only begun to be calcined.'</p>
                  <p>'If a juſt concluſion, with regard to all other
petrifactions, could be drawn from this ſingle
fact, Nature would perhaps require fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years to change trees, of the ſize of thoſe
found petrified in certain places, into ſtones.
But, in particular ſituations, many cauſes may
concur in haſtening the proceſs of petrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. . . . .'</p>

'At Vienna there is to be ſeen a petrified

ſo rare as is commonly imagined; and that,
to diſcover it in many places, requires only
the nice eye of a naturaliſt. Near Mansfeld,
I ſaw a great quantity of petrified oak in a
place where many people daily paſs, without

                  <p>M. Clozier, who found different pieces of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
wood upon the hills in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Etampes, and particularly on that of
Saint-Symphorien, imagined that theſe frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
might have proceeded from ſome petrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
trunks in the mountains. He, therefore,
cauſed pits to be dug in a part of the mountain
of Saint-Symphorien that had been pointed out
to him. After digging ſeveral feet deep, he firſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0195500109:248"/>
diſcovered a petrified root, which led him to the
trunk of a tree of the ſame ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>This root, from its extremity to its junction
with the trunk, was, ſays M. Clozier, five
feet in length; there were other five roots, but
not equally long. . . . .</p>
                  <p>The middling and ſmall roots were not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified,
or at leaſt their petrification was ſo
brittle, that they remained in the ſand, where
the trunk was in the form of powder or aſhes.
It is reaſonable to think, that, when the proceſs
of petrifaction was communicated to theſe roots,
they had been almoſt corrupted, and that the
ligneous parts of which they were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
being too much ſeparated by petrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
could not acquire the degree of ſolidity
neceſſary to a genuine petrifaction. . . .</p>
                  <p>The thickeſt part of the trunk was near ſix
feet in circumference. Its length was three feet
ten inches, and its weight was from five to ſix
hundred pounds. The trunk, as well as the
roots, had all the appearance of wood, as the
bark, the inner rhind, the ſolid and corrupted
wood, the holes of large and ſmall worms, and
even the excrements of theſe worms. All theſe
parts were petrified, but were not ſo ſolid and
hard as the ligneous body, which had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

piece of petrified wood with the following hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
account:</p>
                  <p>'The piece of petrified wood, which I have
the honour of tranſmitting to you, was found
at the depth of more than 150 feet below the
ſurface. . . . Laſt year (1754) when digging
a pit in queſt of coal, at Notre-Dame-au-bois,
a village ſituated between Condé, Saint-Amand,
Mortagne, and Valenciennes, we found, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
600 fathoms from Eſcaut, and after paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
three water-levels, firſt ſeven feet of
rock or hard ſtone called <hi>tourtia</hi> in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of colliers; afterwards, when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at a marſhy earth, we found, at the depth
of 150 feet, as already remarked, the trunk of a
tree of two feet in diameter, which lay acroſs
the pit, and, of courſe, we were prevented
from meaſuring its length. It reſted upon a
large free-ſtone; and many pieces were cut
off from this trunk by the curious. The ſmall
fragment I have the honour of ſending you
was cut off from a ſpecimen given to M. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
a learned mechanic. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'This wood ſeemed rather to have been convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into coal than petrified. How could a tree be
ſunk ſo deep into the earth? Has the ſoil in
which the tree was found been formerly as low?
If that is the caſe, how could this ſoil be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
150 feet? From whence did all this
earth proceed?'</p>

You are ſo intimately acquainted with Nature,

Academy of Sciences, relates ſeveral facts
concerning petrified wood, which merit atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>'All the fibrous ſtones,' he remarks, 'which
have ſome reſemblance to wood, are not petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
wood. But there are many others which
muſt be recogniſed as ſuch, eſpecially if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the peculiar organization of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables. . . . .'</p>
                  <p>'Facts are not wanting to prove that wood
may be converted into ſtone, with as much
eaſe at leaſt as ſeveral other ſubſtances which
inconteſtibly undergo this tranſmutation. But
it is difficult to explain how this effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
I hope I may be permitted to hazard
ſome conjectures on the ſubject, which I ſhall'
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0195500109:252"/>
'endeavour to ſupport by facts and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.'</p>
                  <p>'We find wood which may be conſidered as
only half petrified, and not much heavier than
common wood. Specimens of this kind are
eaſily divided into plates, or even into fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
like certain corrupted timber. Others
are more petrified, and have the weight, the
hardneſs, and the opacity of free-ſtone. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whoſe petrifaction is ſtill more perfect,
admit the ſame poliſh as marble; while others
acquire that of fine oriental agates. I have an
excellent ſpecimen ſent from Martinico to M.
du Hamel, which is converted into a moſt
beautiful ſardonix. Laſtly, we find wood
changed into ſlate. Among theſe ſpecimens,
there are ſome which have retained the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization
of wood ſo completely, that we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
with a lens every appearance exhibited
in unpetrified wood.'</p>
                  <p>'We have ſeen ſome ſpecimens encruſted
with a ſandy iron ore, and others penetrated
with a ſubſtance which, being compoſed of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
and vitriol, makes them approach the
ſtate of pyrites. Some of them are, if we
may uſe the expreſſion, larded with a very
pure iron ore; and others are traverſed by
veins of very black agate.'</p>
                  <p>'We find pieces of wood, one part of which
is converted into a ſtone, and the other into
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0195500109:253"/>
agate: The part converted into ſtone is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
but the other has the hardneſs peculiar
to precious ſtones.'</p>
                  <p>'But, how ſhould certain pieces, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into hard agate, preſerve the diſtinct
characters of organization, as the concentric
circles, the inſertions, the extremities of the
tubes deſtined to tranſmit the ſap, the bark,
the inner rhind, and the wood? If the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſubſtance were entirely deſtroyed, we
ſhould only ſee an agate, without any of the
organic characters formerly mentioned. To
preſerve this appearance of organization, if we
ſuppoſe that the wood ſubſiſts, and that the
pores alone are filled with the petrifying juice,
it ſhould appear, that the vegetable parts might
be extracted from the agate. But I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make any progreſs in this operation: I,
therefore, think, that the ſpecimens in queſtion
retain no parts which have preſerved the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of wood. To give perſpicuity to my i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
I beg the reader to recollect, that, when
a piece of wood is diſtilled in a retort, the coal
which remains after diſtillation is not a ſixth
part of the original weight of the wood.
When this coal is burnt, we obtain only a
ſmall quantity of aſhes, which will ſtill dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
after the lixivial ſalts are abſtracted.'</p>
                  <p>'This ſmall quantity of aſhes being the only
fixed part, the chemical analyſis proves, that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0195500109:254"/>
the fixed parts of a piece of wood are really
very trifling, and that the greateſt portion of
vegetable matter is deſtructible, and may be
gradually carried off, as the wood corrupts.'</p>
                  <p>'Now, if we conſider that the greater part of
the wood is deſtroyed, and that what remains
is a light earth, and eaſily permeable by the
petrifying juice, its converſion into ſtone, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
or ſardonix, will not be more difficult to
conceive than that of bole, clay, or any other
earth. The only difference is, that the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
earth preſerves the appearance of organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,
and the petrifying juice inſinuates into
its pores, without deſtroying its original cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1759, p. 431.—452.</note>.'</p>

to have never been touched by the hand of

feet of clay; then 10 feet of ſand; then a bed

                  <p>M. de Grignon informed me, that, on the
borders of the Marne, near St Dizier, there is
a bed of pyritous wood, the organization of
which is apparent. This bed is ſituated under
a ſtratum of free-ſtone, which is covered with
a ſtratum of pyrites, and above the pyrites is a
ſtratum of lime-ſtone. The bed of pyritous wood
lie upon a blackiſh clay.</p>
                  <p>He likewiſe found, in the pits dug for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the ſubterraneous town of Châtelet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of iron with wooden handles. He
remarked that this wood was converted into a
genuine iron-ore of the hematites ſpecies. The
organization of the wood was not deſtroyed;
but it was brittle, and its whole texture was as
cloſe as that of the hematites. Theſe iron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
with wooden handles had been buried
in the earth ſixteen or ſeventeen hundred years.
The converſion of the wood into hematites had
been affected by the decompoſition of the iron,
which had gradually filled all the pores of the

                  <head>Of Bones ſometimes found in the interior parts of
the Earth.</head>
                  <p>'IN the pariſh of Haux, which is ſituated
between two ſeas, and about half a league
from the port of Langoiran, a point of a rock,
of 11 feet high, detached itſelf from the coaſt,
which was formerly 30 feet high. By its fall
it ſpread over the valley a great quantity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
bones or fragments of bones, ſome of
which were petrified. That they are bones is
unqueſtionable; but it is difficult to aſcertain the
animals to which they belong. The greateſt
number conſiſts of teeth; ſome of them perhaps
belong to the ox or horſe; but, without marking
the difference in figure, moſt of them are larger
than the teeth of theſe animals. There are
likewiſe thigh or leg-bones, and a fragment
of a ſtag or elk's horn. The whole are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with common earth, and ſituated between
two ſtrata of rock. We muſt ſuppoſe that the
carcaſſes of animals have been thrown into a
hollow rock, and, after the fleſh had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a rock of 11 feet high had been formed
above them, which would require the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many ages. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'The Gentlemen of the Academy of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,
who examined theſe bones with phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0195500109:257"/>
accuracy, diſcovered, that, when a
number of fragments were put on a very
briſk fire, they were converted into a fine Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois
blue; and that ſome portions became ſo
hard, that, when cut by a lapidary, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a fine poliſh. . . . It muſt alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
that bones which evidently belonged
to different animals were equally converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Turquois<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1719, p. 24.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>'On the 28th of January 1760,' ſays M. de
Guettard, 'there were found, 160 fathoms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the mineral baths, bones included in a
rock with a gray ſurface. This rock was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
laminated nor conſiſted of ſeparate ſtrata,
but was one continued maſs of ſtone. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'After having, by means of gun-powder, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated
five feet deep into this rock, we found
a great number of human bones belonging to
every part of the body, as jaw-bones with their
teeth, bones of the arms, thighs, limbs, ribs,
rotulae, &amp;c. jumbled together in the greateſt
diſorder. Entire ſkulls, or portions of them,
chiefly prevailed.'</p>
                  <p>'Beſide theſe human bones, we met with
ſeveral fragments which could not be aſcribed
to man. In ſome places, they are in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
maſſes, and in other more diſperſed. . .'</p>
                  <p>'When we arrived at the depth of four feet
and a half, we found ſix human heads in an
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0195500109:258"/>
inclined poſition. In five of theſe heads, the
occiput with its appendages, except the bones
of the face, were preſerved. This occiput was
partly encruſted with ſtone, its cavity was fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſtone, and had aſſumed the ſame mould
or figure. In the ſixth head, the face is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire:
It is broad in proportion to its length.
We eaſily diſtinguiſh the form of the fleſhy
cheeks. The eyes are ſhut, pretty long, but
narrow. The front is large, and the noſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
flat, but well formed; the middle line is
diſtinguiſhable. The mouth is well made,
and ſhut; the upper lip is a little thick in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the under. The chin is well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned,
and the whole muſcles are ſtrongly
marked. The colour of the head is reddiſh,
and reſembles thoſe of the Tritons feigned by
painters. Its ſubſtance is ſimilar to that of
the ſtone in which it was found; it is, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeaking, only the maſk of the natural
head.'</p>
                  <p>The above relation was ſent by M. le Baron
de Gaillard-Lonjumeau to Madame de Boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jourdain,
who tranſmitted it to M. Guettard, with
ſome ſpecimens of the bones. That theſe bones
were really human, is a very doubtful point;
'for every appearance in this quarry,' M. de
Lonjumeau remarks, 'announces that it has
been formed of relicks of bodies broken in
pieces, and which had been long toſſed about
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0195500109:259"/>
by the waves of the ſea before they were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
into one heap. As this maſs of bones
lies horizontally, and has been ſucceſſively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with ſtony matter, it is eaſy to conceive
how a maſk was formed on the faces of thoſe
heads, the fleſh having little time to corrupt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when the bodies were buried under the
water. We may, therefore, reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that theſe heads were not human. . . .
They rather ſeem to be the heads of thoſe fiſhes,
whoſe teeth are found in the ſame parts of
the ſtones along with the bones ſuppoſed to
belong to the human ſpecies.'</p>
                  <p>'It appears that the collection of bones in
the environs of Aix, are ſimilar to thoſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
ſome years ago by M. Borda near Dax
in Gaſcony. The teeth diſcovered at Aix, by
the deſcription given of them, ſeem to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thoſe found at Dax, of which an under
jaw is ſtill preſerved. This jaw unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
belongs to a large fiſh. . . . I muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
conclude, that the bones in the quarry of
Aix are ſimilar to thoſe diſcovered at Dax;. .
and that theſe bones, whatever they are,
ſhould be referred to the ſkeletons of fiſhes
rather than to thoſe of man. . . .'</p>
                  <p>'One of the heads in queſtion was about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and a half inches long by three and ſome
lines broad. Its figure is that of an oblong
globe, flat at the baſe, thicker at the poſterior
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0195500109:260"/>
than the anterior end, and divided in the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part by ſeven or eight bands from ſeven
to twelve lines wide. Each band is likewiſe
divided into two equal parts by a ſlight fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
The bands extend from the baſe to the
ſummit. Thoſe of one ſide are ſeparated from
thoſe of the other by another and deeper fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
which gradually enlarges from the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to the poſterior part.'</p>
                  <p>'From this deſcription we cannot recognize
the mould of a human head. The bones of
man's head are not divided into bands. The
human head is compoſed of four principal
bones, the figures of which appear not in the
mould above deſcribed. It has not an interior
creſt which extends longitudinally from the
anterior to the poſterior part, and divides it
into two equal parts, which might give riſe to
the furrow on the ſuperior part of the ſtony
mould.'</p>
                  <p>'Theſe conſiderations induce me to think,
that this ſubſtance is rather the body of a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilus
than a human head. There are nautili
actually divided into bands or bucklers like this
mould. They have a channel or furrow which
runs along the whole curvature, and divides
them into two, from which the ſtony furrow
might derive its origin<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1760, p. 209.—218.</note>,' &amp;c.</p>

                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0195500109:261"/>
I am perſuaded, as well as M. le Baron de
Lonjumeau, that theſe heads never belonged to
men, but to animals of the ſeal kind, to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otters,
and to ſea lions or bears. It is not at
Aix or Dax alone, that the heads and bones of
theſe animals are found in rocks and caverns.
His Highneſs the preſent Prince Marcgrave of
Anſpach, who to great affability unites a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
taſte for knowledge, has been ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging
as to give me, for the Royal Cabinet,
a collection of bones from the caverns of Gail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenrente
in his Marcgraviate of Bareith. M.
Daubenton has compared theſe bones with thoſe
of the common bear, from which they differ
only by being larger. The head and teeth are
longer and thicker; and the muzzle is longer
and more protuberant than in our largeſt bears.
In this collection, with which this noble Prince
has enriched our cabinet, there is a head which
naturaliſts have denominated <hi>the head of M. de
Buffon's ſmall ſeal</hi>; but, as we know not the form
and ſtructure of the heads of ſea lions, bears,
and large and ſmall ſeals, we ſhall ſuſpend our
judgment concerning the animals to which theſe
foſſil bones have appertained.</p>

Changes of Sea into Land, Vol. I. p. 483.</head>
               <p>IN traverſing the coaſts of France, we perceive
that a part of Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tany, Picardy, Flanders, and
Lower Normandy, have very recently been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by the ſea; becauſe, through all this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of country, we ſtill find great quantities of
oyſters, and other ſhells, in their natural ſtate.
We are certain, from experience, that, for a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
paſt, the ſea has been retiring from the
coaſt of Dunkirk. When the moles of this port
were conſtructing in the year 1670, the fort of
Good-hope, which terminate one of theſe moles,
was built upon piles a great way beyond the
low water-mark. But, at preſent, the water
never advances nearer this fort than 300 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.
In 1714, when the new harbour of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dik
was deepening, the moles were likewiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
beyond the low water-mark; but now,
when the tide is ebb, there is a dry ſpace of
more than 500 fathoms. If the ſea continues
thus gradually to retire, Dunkirk, like Aigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortes,
will, in a few centuries, be no longer a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0195500109:263"/>
ſea-port. If the ſea has loſt ground ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
in our times, how far muſt it have retired
ſince the beginning of the world<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. pour la ſubdelegation de Dunkerque, relativement à la Hiſt. nat. de ce canton.</note>?</p>
               <p>The bare inſpection of Saintonge is ſufficient
to convince us, that it was formerly covered by
the ſea. The ocean having abandoned theſe
lands, the Charente followed as the waters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
and formed a river where formerly there
was only a great lake or moraſs. The country
of Aunis, which was anciently covered by the
ſea and ſtagnant waters, is one of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
lands of France. It is even probable that
this territory was a moraſs about the end of the
fourteenth century<note n="†" place="bottom">Extrait de l'hiſt. de la Rochelle, art. 2. et 3.</note>.</p>
               <p>It appears, therefore, that the ocean, during
ſome centuries, has retired many feet from all
our coaſts; and if we examine thoſe of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,
from Rouſſillon to Provence, we
ſhall find that this ſea has likewiſe retreated
nearly in the ſame proportion. Theſe facts
render it evident, that the circumference of all
the coaſts of Spain and Portugal, as well as thoſe
of France, is greatly extended. The ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
has been made with regard to Sweden,
where ſome philoſophers have conjectured, that,
in the courſe of 4000 years, the Baltic, the depth
of which exceeds not thirty fathoms, will be
totally abandoned by the waters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0195500109:264"/>
If ſimilar obſervations were made in every
country, I am perſuaded, that, in general, the
ſea would be found to have retired from every
coaſt. The ſame cauſes which produced its firſt
retreat and ſucceſſive ſinking, are not abſolutely
annihilated. In the beginning, the ſea was two
thouſand fathoms above its preſent level. The
immenſe ſwellings on the ſurface of the globe,
which firſt ſubſided, made the waters ſink, at firſt
rapidly, and afterwards in proportion as the
more inconſiderable caverns gave way. The
ſea, of courſe, was proportionally depreſſed; and,
as many caverns ſtill exiſt, which muſt, from
time to time, ſink, either by the action of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's,
by the force of water, or by earthquakes,
we may with certainty predict, that the ocean
will continue to retire, and, conſequently, that
the extent of all our continents will be gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
augmented.</p>

               <p>THE treatiſe compoſed by the Count de

to eſtabliſh by facts and reaſoning, his
theory of the formation of the Planets<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. 1. p. 59. of this work.</note>. But
as this theory, however it may be reliſhed on
the Continent, is perhaps too fanciful to receive
the general approbation of the cool and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

to render it into Engliſh. Many of the facts,
however, are too important to be omitted. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead

               <p>The Count de Buffon begins his ſubject with
a preliminary diſcourſe, in which he endeavours
to unfold the different changes the terreſtrial
globe has undergone from is firſt projection out
of the ſun to the preſent time. In this diſcourſe
the author obſerves the following order: 1. He
mentions ſuch facts as may lead us to the origin
of Nature. 2. He marks thoſe monuments
which ought to be regarded as the evidences of
the firſt ages. 3. He collects ſuch traditions as
may convey ſome idea of the ages which ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
After which, ſays he, we ſhall endeavour
to connect the whole by analogies, and to form
a chain which, from the commencement of

                  <p>The firſt fact, namely, the elevation of the
globe at the Equator and its depreſſion at the
poles, has been mathematically demonſtrated and
phyſically proved by the theory of gravitation,
and by experiments with the pendulum. The
figure of the earth is preciſely the ſame which a
fluid globe revolving round its axis with equal
celerity would aſſume. Hence the matter of
which the earth is compoſed was in a ſtate of
fluidity the moment it aſſumed its form, and this
moment happened whenever it began to turn
round its own axis. Now, though heat is the
general cauſe of fluidity, ſince water itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heat, would form a ſolid maſs, we have two
methods of conceiving the poſſibility of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
fluid ſtate of the earth. The firſt is the
ſolution of terreſtrial matters in water; and
the ſecond is their liquefaction by fire. But
moſt of the ſolid matters of which the earth is
compoſed are not ſoluble in water; and, at the
ſame time, the quantity of water, in proportion
to that of dry and ſolid matter, is ſo ſmall, that
it is impoſſible the one could be diſſolved by the
other. Of courſe, as this ſtate of fluidity could
not be effected by diſſolution or maceration in
water, this fluidity muſt have been produced by
the operation of fire.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>This concluſion aſſumes a new degree of
probability from the ſecond fact, and is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
certain by the third. The internal heat
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0195500109:269"/>
of the globe, which ſtill ſubſiſts partially, and
is greater than that afforded by the ſun, ſhews
that this primitive fire is not yet nearly diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated.
The ſurface of the earth is colder
than its interior parts. Uncontrovertible and
reiterated experiments evince, that the whole
maſs of the globe has a heat proper to itſelf,
and totally independent of that of the ſun.
This heat is rendered evident by comparing

the waters of which, at equal depths, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
nearly the ſame heat as that of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
parts of the earth. 'Having plunged a
thermometer,' M. Marſigli remarks, 'into the
ſea in different places and at different times,
it was found that the temperature at 10, 20,
30, and 120 fathoms, was equally from 10 to
10¾ degrees<note n="†" place="bottom">L. Hiſt. phyſique de la mer par Marſigli, p. 16.</note>'. On this ſubject M. de Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
judiciouſly remarks, 'that the hotteſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which are at the greateſt depth, muſt, as
being the lighteſt, continually aſcend above
thoſe that are heavier. Hence, according to
Marſigli's obſervations, the temperature of this
immenſe body of water muſt be always near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
equal, except near the ſurface, which is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0195500109:272"/>
expoſed to the impreſſions of the air, where
the water ſometimes freezes before it has time
to deſcend by its own weight and coolneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſſert. ſur la glace, p. 69.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is eaſy to ſhow, that the fluidity of
the ocean ought not, in general, to be aſcribed
to the powers of the ſolar rays; ſince we learn
from experience, that the light of the ſun
does not penetrate the moſt limpid water above
ſix hundred feet; and, of courſe, that its heat
will not reach above a fourth part of that
depth, or one hundred and fifty feet. The
late M. Bouguer, a learned aſtronomer of the
Royal Academy of Sciences, found, that, when
ſixteen pieces of common glaſs were applied
to each other, and making a thickneſs of 9½
lines, the light, in paſſing through theſe ſixteen
pieces of glaſs, was diminiſhed 247 times. He
then placed ſeventy-four pieces of the ſame
glaſs, in a tube, and at ſome diſtance from
each other. When this experiment was made,
the ſun was 50 degrees above the horizon. A
very faint appearance of the ſun's diſk was ſtill
perceptible through theſe 74 pieces of glaſs.
The perſons who attended him could likewiſe
perceive, but with difficulty, a feeble light.
But, when other three pieces of glaſs were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the ſeventy-four none of them could
diſtinguiſh the ſmalleſt veſtige of light. Hence,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0195500109:273"/>
if we ſuppoſe eighty pieces of the ſame glaſs,
we have a thickneſs which will render it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
opaque.</p>
                  <p>From this analogy between the tranſparency
of glaſs and water, M. Bouguer found, that, to
render ſea-water, which is the moſt limpid of
all waters, perfectly opaque, a thickneſs of 256
feet is neceſſary, provided, by another experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the light of a flambeau was diminiſhed
in the proportion of 14 to 5 in traverſing 115
inches of water contained in a tube of 9 feet 7
inches in length. Hence, according to M. Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,
no ſenſible light can paſs deeper than 256
feet in water<note n="*" place="bottom">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ai d'Optique ſur la gradation de la lumiére, p. 85.</note>.</p>
                  <p>It appears to me, however, that the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
drawn by M. Bouguer is very diſtant from
the truth. His experiments ſhould have been
made with maſſes of glaſs of different thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and not with ſeparate pieces applied to
each other. I am perſuaded that the ſun's
light would penetrate a greater thickneſs than
that of theſe eighty pieces, which formed a
thickneſs of no more than 47½ lines, or near 4
inches. Now, though theſe pieces he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
were of common glaſs, it is certain that a
ſolid maſs of the ſame glaſs, of four inches thick,
would not entirely intercept the light of the
ſun, eſpecially as I know, by my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that light paſſes eaſily through 6 ſolid
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0195500109:274"/>
inches of white glaſs. I believe, therefore, that
the thickneſſes aſſumed by M. Bouguer ſhould
be more than doubled, and that the light of
the ſun penetrates 600 feet deep into the waters
of the ocean; for there is another inaccuracy
in M. Bouguer's experiments. He did not
make the light of the ſun paſs through his tube
of 9 feet 7 inches long: He employed the
light of a flambeau, and thence concluded the
diminution to be in the proportion of 14 to 5.
But I am perſuaded, that, if the light of the ſun
had been employed, this diminution would not
have been ſo great, eſpecially as the light of a
flambeau could only paſs obliquely, whilſt that
of the ſun, by paſſing directly, would have pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
deeper by its incidence alone, independent
of its purity and intenſity. Thus, taking all
circumſtances into conſideration, it appears, that,
to approach the truth as near as poſſible, we
ſhould ſuppoſe, that the light of the ſun pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
the ſea to the depth of 600 feet, and that
its heat reaches 150 feet deep. The light and
heat muſt here be underſtood as ſenſible degrees
only of theſe qualities.</p>
                  <p>That the heat of the ſun penetrates not above
150 feet deep in the waters of the ocean, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained
by analogy derived from an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which appears to be deciſive. With a
lens of 27 inches diameter by ſix inches thick
at the centre, I perceived, that, by covering the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0195500109:275"/>
middle part, the lens burnt only from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
as far as four inches thick, and that
all the thicker part ſcarcely produced any heat.
I then covered the whole lens, except an inch
round the centre, and I found, that, after paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this thickneſs of ſix inches of glaſs, the
light of the ſun had no influence on the thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.
Hence I am warranted to preſume, that
this ſame light, weakened by 150 feet thick of
water, would not produce a perceptible degree
of heat.</p>
                  <p>The light proceeding from the moon is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
a reflected light of the ſun. This
light, however, has no ſenſible heat, even when
the rays are collected into the focus of a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs.
Neither would the light of the ſun
have any heat, after paſſing through a certain
depth of water; becauſe it would then be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
feeble as that of the moon I am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
perſuaded, that, by allowing the rays of
the ſun to paſs through a large tube filled with
water, and only 50 feet long, which is no more
than a third of the depth I have ſuppoſed, this
feeble light would produce no effect upon the
thermometer, even though the liquor ſtood at
the freezing point. From whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that, though the light of the ſun pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
600 feet in the waters of the ocean, its
heat would not reach one fourth part of that
depth. All the waters below this point would
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0195500109:276"/>
neceſſarily freeze, unleſs there was an internal
heat in the earth, which alone can maintain
their fluidity. In the ſame manner, it is proved
by experience that the heat of the ſolar rays pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates
not above 15 or 20 feet deep in the
earth, ſince ice is preſerved at theſe depths du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the warmeſt ſummers. Hence, it is clear,
that, below the baſin of the ſea, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſuperior ſtrata of the earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

fluidity of the waters, and produces the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the earth. In the interior parts of
the earth, therefore, a heat exiſts which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to it, and which is totally independent of
that communicated by the ſun.</p>
                  <p>We might confirm this general fact by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of particular ones. Every man has remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the ſnow melts in all places where the
vapours of the interior parts of the earth have
a free iſſue, as over pits, covered aqueducts,
vaults, ciſterns, &amp;c. while in all other places,
where the earth, bound up by the froſt, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
theſe vapours, the ſnow not only remains,
but, inſtead of melting, freezes. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is alone ſufficient to ſhow, that theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations
from the internal parts of the earth
have a real and ſenſible degree of heat.</p>

be vitrified by the more intenſe heat of
burning glaſſes. Hence all the materials of this
globe, at leaſt all thoſe which are known to us,
have glaſs for their baſis, and may be ultimately
reduced to their primitive ſtate.</p>
                  <p>We have, therefore, proved the original li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefaction
by fire of the whole maſs of this
globe, agreeably to the moſt rigorous rules of
logic: 1. <hi>A priori,</hi> by the firſt fact, namely, the
elevation of the earth at the equator, and its
depreſſion at the poles. 2. <hi>Ab actu,</hi> by the
ſecond and third fact, namely, the internal

by the fourth fact, which ſhows the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this action of fire, <hi>i. e.</hi> glaſs in all terreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial
ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>But, though the materials which compoſe this
globe have originally been of a vitreous nature,
and may all be reduced to glaſs, they ought to
be diſtinguiſhed from each other with regard to
the different ſtates in which they are found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are converted into glaſs by the action
of fire. They ſhould, in the firſt place, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into vitrifiable and calcarious ſubſtances.
The firſt undergo no change by fire, unleſs it
be puſhed to ſuch a degree of intenſity as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0195500109:279"/>
to reduce them to glaſs; but an inferior
degree of heat reduces the others to lime. The
quantity of calcarious ſubſtances, though very
conſiderable, is ſmall when compared to thoſe
which are vitrifiable. The <hi>fifth</hi> fact above laid
down proves, that calcarious bodies have been
formed at a different period, and by another ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and we evidently perceive, that all the
matters which have not been produced by the
immediate action of the primitive fire, have been
formed by the intervention of water; becauſe
they are all compoſed of ſhells and other relicks
of marine bodies. Under the claſs of vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſubſtances are comprehended pure rock,
quartz, ſand, free-ſtone, granite, ſlates, clays,
metals, and metallic minerals. Theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
form the genuine baſis of the globe,
and compoſe its principal and greateſt part. The
whole of them have been originally produced
by the primitive fire. Sand is nothing but glaſs
in powder; ſlates, dried clays, pure rock, free-ſtone,
and granite, are only vitreous maſſes, or vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
ſand in a concreted form. Flints, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals,
metals, and moſt other minerals, are only
diſtillations, exudations, or ſublimations of the
firſt matters, all of which unfold their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
origin and their common nature, by their
aptitude of being converted into glaſs.</p>
                  <p>But calcarious ſand and gravel, chalk, brown
free-ſtone, marble, alabaſtar, calcarious ſpatha,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0195500109:280"/>
both opaque and tranſparent, in a word, every
ſubſtance which can be converted into lime,
do not at firſt exhibit their original nature.
Though, like all the others, they proceed from
glaſs, calcarious bodies have paſſed through fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,
which have changed their appearance.
They have been formed by water. They are
compoſed entirely of madrepores, ſhells, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
relicks of aquatic animals, which alone
are capable of converting fluids into ſolids, and
of transforming the water of the ſea into ſtone.
Common marble and other calcarious ſtones are
compoſed of entire ſhells and fragments of ſhells,
of madrepores, aſtroites, &amp;c. all the parts of which
are either ſtill evident, or eaſily recogniſable.
Gravel is nothing but broken fragments of
marble and calcarious ſtones which froſt and
the action of the air detach from the rocks;
and they are equally convertible into lime. Lime
may alſo be made of ſhells, chalk, and light
land-ſtone. Alabaſter, and thoſe marbles which
contain alabaſter, may be regarded as large
ſtalacti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es, which are formed at the expence of
other marbles and common ſtones. Calcarious
ſpatha is likewiſe formed by exudation or diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
from calcarious ſubſtances, in the ſame
manner as rock-cryſtal originates from vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiable
matters. All this may be proved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
theſe different ſubſtances, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining

Great quantities of ivory have been and

daily are found in Siberia, in Ruſſia, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
northern countries of Europe and Aſia.
Theſe tuſks of the elephant are found ſome
feet below the earth, or they are expoſed by
the waters when they break down the banks
of rivers. We find theſe tuſks and bones of
the elephant in ſo many places, and in ſuch
quantities, that they never could be brought
into ſuch cold regions by human power. From
inconteſtible and reiterated proofs, we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to acknowledge, that theſe animals were
formerly natives of the north, as they are now
of the ſouth. What renders this fact more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
and more difficult to explain, we find the
remains of thoſe animals, now peculiar to the ſouth
of the Old Continent, not only in our northern
provinces, but likewiſe in Canada and other
parts of North America. In the Royal cabinet
there are ſeveral tuſks and many bones of the
elephant, which were found in Siberia. We
have other tuſks and bones of the ſame animal
which were found in France; as well as teeth of
the hippopotamus diſcovered in America, near
the river Ohio. Hence theſe animals, which
cannot ſubſiſt in cold countries, have formerly
exiſted in northern climates. Of courſe, the
Frozen Zone was at that period equally warm as
our Torrid Zone is at preſent; for it is impoſſible
that the bodily conſtitution and real habits of
theſe animals, which are the moſt permanent and
invariable things in nature, ſhould ſo far change
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0195500109:285"/>
as to beſtow the temperature of the rain-deer upon
the elephant. Neither can we ſuppoſe that theſe
ſouthern animals, which require much heat for their
ſubſiſtence, could ever live and multiply in nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
regions, if the climate were equally cold as
it is at preſent. M. Gmelin, who travelled in Sibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
and there collected many bones of the elephant,
ſuppoſes that vaſt inundations in the ſouth had
driven the elephants to the north, where they would
all periſh at once by the rigour of the climate.
But this cauſe is not proportioned to the effect.
More ivory, perhaps, has already been brought
from the north than all the elephants of India now
exiſting could furniſh. Much more will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
when the vaſt deſerts of the north, which
are ſcarcely known, ſhall be peopled, and the
earth cultivated and dug by the hands of man.
Beſides, it is extremely improbable, that theſe
animals ſhould take the route which is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to their nature; for, if they were
puſhed by inundations from the ſouth, why did
they not rather fly to the eaſt and weſt? Why
did they fly as far as the ſixtieth degree of north
latitude, when they might have ſtopt on the
road, or turned aſide to more fortunate climates?
And how is it poſſible to conceive, that, by an
inundation from the ſouthern ocean, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
were chaſed a thouſand leagues into the
Old Continent, and more than three thouſand
into the New? It is impoſſible that an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Indian ocean ſhould drive the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0195500109:286"/>
into Canada, or even into Siberia; and
it is equally impoſſible, that they ſhould arrive
in ſuch numbers as are indicated by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
                  <p>Diſſatisfied with this explication, I imagined
that a more plauſible one might be given, and
which ſhould perfectly correſpond with my the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
of the earth. But, before exhibiting my
ideas on this ſubject, I ſhall, to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
remark, 1. That the ivory found in Sibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
and in Canada unqueſtionably belongs to
the elephant, and not to the morſe or ſea-cow,
as ſome voyagers have pretended. In the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
regions, we likewiſe find the foſſil ivory of
the morſe; but it is different from that of the
elephant; and they are eaſily diſtinguiſhed by
comparing their internal texture. The tuſks,
the grinders, the ſcapulae, the thigh-bones, and
other bones found in the northern climates, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
belong to the elephant; it is even impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to heſitate concerning the identity of
the ſpecies. The large ſquare teeth diſcovered
in the ſame northern countries, the grinding
ſide of which reſembles the ſpade painted on
cards, have every mark of the dentes molares
of the hippopotamus; and thoſe enormous teeth,
the grinding ſide of which is compoſed of large
blunt points or protuberances, have belonged
to ſome terreſtrial animal that now no longer
exiſts, like the great volutes called <hi>cornua ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
which at preſent exiſt not in the ocean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0195500109:287"/>
2. The bones and tuſks of theſe ancient ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
are every way as large as thoſe of the
Indian elephants, to which we have compared
them. This is a proof that theſe animals did
not inhabit the northern regions from any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
ſince they acquired, in that ſituation,
their full growth and complete dimenſions. Of
this fact we may be aſcertained by the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and dimenſions of them given by M.
Daubeuton under the article <hi>Elephant.</hi> But,
ſince that time, I have had tranſmitted to me an
entire tuſk and ſome fragments of foſſil ivory,
the length and breadth of which greatly exceed
the tuſks of the common elephant. I ſearched
all the ſhops of the Paris ivory-merchants; but
I found no tuſk which could be compared to
that in my poſſeſſion. But, of a great number, I
found only one equal to thoſe ſent from Siberia,
whoſe circumference at the baſe is nineteen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Ivory, which is taken from living ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
or from recent ſkeletons found in the
foreſts, is denominated <hi>raw ivory</hi>; and the
appellation of <hi>roaſied ivory</hi> is given to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from the earth, the quality of which is
more or leſs altered, according to the time it has
remained under ground, or according to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the earth in which it has been buried. Moſt
tuſks which come from the North are ſtill very
ſolid, and very fine works may be made of them.
The largeſt were ſent to us by M. de L'Iſle, an
aſtronomer, and member of the Royal Academy
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0195500109:288"/>
of Sciences. He collected them in his travels
through Siberia. In all the ſhops of Paris, there
was not a ſingle tuſk of raw ivory which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
nineteen inches in circumference: They
were all ſmaller. This tuſk was ſix feet and an
inch in length; and it appears, that thoſe in the
Royal Cabinet, which were found in Siberia,
were, when entire, more than ſix feet and a half:
But, as their extremities were cut off, we could
only make a near gueſs at their real length.</p>
                  <p>If we compare the thigh-bones found in the
ſame northern countries, we ſhall be ſatisfied that
they are at leaſt equally long, and conſiderably
thicker, than thoſe of the Indian elephants.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, as formerly remarked, we have made
an exact compariſon of the bones and tuſks ſent
from Siberia with thoſe of the ſkeleton of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant,
and we found that all theſe bones are
evidently the relicks of theſe animals. The Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berian
tuſks have not only the figure, but the
genuine ſtructure of elephant ivory, which M.
Daubenton deſcribes in the following terms.</p>
                  <p>'When an elephant's tuſk is cut tranſverſely,
we ſee, at or near the centre, a black point cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>heart.</hi> But, if the tuſk is cut where it
is hollow, there is only a round hole in the
centre. We perceive crooked lines which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in different directions from the centre to
the circumference, and, by croſſing, form ſmall
lozenges. At the circumference, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a narrow circular band. The crooked
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0195500109:289"/>
lines ramify in proportion as they recede from
the centre. Hence the ſize of the lozenges is
nearly the ſame throughout. Their ſides, or at
leaſt their angles, are of a more lively colour
than the areas, doubtleſs becauſe their ſubſtance
is more compact. The band at the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is compoſed of ſtraight and tranſverſe
fibres, which, if prolonged, would terminate in
the centre. It is the appearance of theſe lines
and points which is conſidered as the grain of
the ivory. This grain is perceptible in all ivories;
but it is more or leſs diſtinct in different tuſks;
and, when the grain is ſufficiently apparent, the
ivory gets the name of <hi>large grained,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
it from that whoſe grain is fine.'</p>
                  <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed that elephants could be
tranſported into Siberia by men; for the ſtate of
captivity alone, independent of the rigour of the
climate, would have reduced them to a fourth
or a third of the dimenſions which their remains
exhibit. Of this effect we have ſufficient proof
from the compariſon we have made between an
entire ſkeleton of an elephant in the Royal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet,
which had lived ſixteen years at Verſailles,
with the tuſks of other elephants brought from
their native country. This ſkeleton and theſe
tuſks, though of conſiderable ſize, are one half
ſmaller than the tuſks and ſkeletons of theſe
which live in freedom in Aſia or in Africa; and,
at the ſame time, they are at leaſt two thirds
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0195500109:290"/>
ſmaller than the bones of the ſame animals found
in Siberia.</p>
                  <p>3. The great quantities of ivory already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by accident in countries nearly deſert,
and where no man ſearches for it, ſhow, that it
is neither by one nor by ſeveral accidents, nor
at one and the ſame time, that ſome individuals
of this ſpecies have found their way into the
northern regions, but that the ſpecies had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
exiſted and multiplied there, in the ſame
manner as they now exiſt and multiply in ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
latitudes.</p>
                  <p>The only queſtion, therefore, which remains
to be ſolved, is, Whether there is or has been a
cauſe that could ſo change the temperature of
the different parts of the globe as to render the
northern regions, which are now extremely cold,
equally warm as the ſouthern climates?</p>
                  <p>Some philoſophers may imagine that this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
has been produced by the change in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquity
of the ecliptic; becauſe, at firſt ſight, this
change ſeems to indicate, that, as the inclination
of the axis of the globe is not permanent,
the earth might formerly revolve round an axis
ſo different from that on which it now turns, as to
make Siberia then lie immediately under the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator.
Aſtronomers have obſerved, that the
change in the obliquity of the ecliptic is about
45 ſeconds in a century. Hence, by ſuppoſing
this augmentation to be conſtant and ſucceſſive,
60 centuries would produce a diſtance of 45
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0195500109:291"/>
minutes, and 3600 centuries would produce a
change of 45 degrees. Such an alteration would
bring back the 60th degree of latitude to the
15th, <hi>i. e.</hi> the country of Siberia, where the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants
formerly exiſted, to the regions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
where they ſtill exiſt and multiply. Now,
it may be ſaid, we have only to admit this long
lapſe of time in order to account for the regular
abode of elephants in Siberia: It is 360,000 years
ago ſince the earth revolved round an axis 45
degrees diſtant from that upon which it turns at
preſent: The 15th degree of latitude was then
the 60th, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that this idea, and the mode of
explication which reſults from it, cannot, upon
examination, be ſupported. The change in the
obliquity of the ecliptic is not a conſtant and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
diminution and augmentation. On the
contrary, it is a limited variation, and ſometimes
on one ſide and ſometimes on the other;
and, conſequently, can never produce, on any
ſide, nor in any climate, this difference of 45
degrees of inclination; for the variation in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquity
of the earth's axis is occaſioned by
the action of the planets, which alter the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ecleptic, without affecting the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
To take the ſtrongeſt of theſe attractions,
which is that of Venus, it would require
126,000 years to make a change of 180 degrees
in the ecliptic of that planet, and, of courſe, to
produce an alteration of 6 degrees 47 minutes
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0195500109:292"/>
in the real obliquity of the earth's axis; ſince 6
degrees 47 minutes are the double of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the orbit of Venus. In the ſame
manner, the action of Jupiter cannot, in 93,6000
years, change the obliquity of the ecliptic above
2 degrees 38 minutes; and ſtill this effect is in
part compenſated by the preceding. Hence it
is impoſſible that this change in the obliquity of
the earth's axis ſhould ever amount to 6 degrees,
unleſs we ſuppoſe, that the orbits of all the
plane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſhould likewiſe change; a ſuppoſition
which we cannot nor ought not to admit, ſince
no cauſe exiſts which could produce this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>But I am enabled to ſolve this difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to deduce it from an immediate cauſe.
We have already ſeen, that the terreſtrial globe,
when it firſt aſſumed its form, was in a ſtate
of fluidity, and that the water being unable to
diſſolve terreſtrial bodies, this fluidity was a
liquefaction occaſioned by fire. Now, to paſs
from this burning and liquified ſtate to a mild
and temperate heat, time was neceſſary. The
globe could not at once cool to its preſent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.
Thus, during the firſt ages after its
formation, the heat proper to the earth was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
greater than that which it received
from the ſun; ſince it is ſtill much greater.
This immenſe fire being afterwards gradually
diſſipated, the polar, like all other climates, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
ſucceſſive changes from heat to cold.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0195500109:293"/>
Of courſe, a certain time, or rather a long tract of
time, exiſted, during which the northern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
after having burnt like all others, enjoyed
the ſame heat which at preſent is felt in the
ſouthern climates. Hence theſe northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
might and actually have been inhabited
by animals now peculiar to the ſouth, and to
whom this degree of heat is indiſpenſible.
The fact, therefore, inſtead of being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
perfectly accords with the other facts,
and is no more than a conſequence of them.
Inſtead of oppoſing my theory of the earth,
this fact, on the contrary, is an acceſſory proof
of its reality, and confirms the moſt obſcure
point I have advanced; <hi>i. e.</hi> when we attempt
to look back into that profundity of time
when the light of genius is apt to extinguiſh
itſelf, and when, for want of obſervations,
genius has no aid to lead us to a more remote
period.</p>
                  <p>A ſixth epoch, poſterior to the other five, is
that when the two Continents were ſeparated
from each other. It is certain, that they were
not ſeparated when the elephants lived equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the north of Europe, Aſia, and America;
I ſay, equally; for we find their bones in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,
in Ruſſia, and in Canada. Hence the
ſeparation of the two Continents happened po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior
to the abode of theſe animals in the
northern regions. But, as we likewiſe find the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0195500109:294"/>
tuſks of the elephant in Poland, in Germany,
in France, and in Italy, we muſt conclude,
that, in proportion as theſe northern regions
cooled, the elephants retired toward the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
zone, where the heat of the ſun, and
the greater thickneſs of the globe, compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated
the loſs of the earth's internal heat; and
that, in the progreſs of time, the temperate
zone having alſo become too cold, the elephant
gradually migrated to the climates under the
Torrid Zone, which alone have longeſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
by the greater thickneſs of the globe, a
ſuperior degree of internal heat. Theſe are
likewiſe the only climates where this interior
heat, united with that of the ſun, is ſtill ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſupport their exiſtence, and to permit
them to propagate their ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>Independent of the ſpecimens tranſmitted
from Ruſſia and Siberia, and which are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Royal cabinet, there are many others
in private collections. Vaſt numbers of them
are to be ſeen in the muſaeum of Peterſburg, as
appears from a catalogue printed in the year
1742. There are likewiſe many of them in the
Britiſh muſaeum, in that of Copenhagen, and
in ſome other collections in Britain, Germany,
and Italy. This northern ivory, like the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,
is uſed in manufacturing many articles of
hardware, &amp;c. Hence the great quantity of
the tuſks and bones of elephants found in Sibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0195500109:295"/>
and Ruſſia can no longer remain a doubtful
point.</p>
                  <p>M. Pallas, a learned naturaliſt, in his late
journey through Siberia, found a great quantity
of elephants bones, and an entire ſkeleton of a
rhinoceros, which was buried a few feet only
under the ſurface of the ground.</p>
                  <p>'Enormous bones of the elephant were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcovered at Swijatoki, ſeventeen verſts
from Peterſburg: They were found in a ſpot
which had long been covered with water.
Hence ſome prodigious revolution muſt have
changed the climate, the productions, and the
animals, in every quarter of the globe. Theſe
medals of Nature prove, that thoſe countries
which are now deſolated by the rigours of
intenſe cold, have formerly enjoyed all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of the ſouthern latitudes<note n="*" place="bottom">Journal de Politique et de Literature, 5. Jan. 1776, art. <hi>Peterſbourg.</hi>

from Fort du Queſne or Pitſburgh, he ſaw, in
the neighbourhood of a large ſalt marſh, where
the wild animals aſſemble at certain ſeaſons of

carefully examined the place, he diſcovered,
in a high bank on the ſide of the marſh, a

the bones and tuſks of elephants.'</p>
                  <p>'But, Sir, the large grinding teeth which I

There are others ſtill larger than theſe, which

we reconcile this paradox? May we not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that there formerly exiſted a large ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
which had the tuſks of an elephant and
the grinders of the hippopotamus? for theſe
large grinders are very different from thoſe of

and grinders which he ſaw, Mr Croghan thinks,
that there muſt have been at leaſt thirty of
theſe animals buried in this place. Elephants,
however, were never known in America; and
it is improbable that they could be brought

                              <p>'About a mile and a half from the river Ohio,
there are ſix enormous ſkeletons buried on end,
with tuſks from five to ſix feet long, and of
the ſame form and ſubſtance as elephants tuſks.
They were thirty inches in circumference at
the root. They tapered to a point. But, as they
were broken, we could not perceive how they
were joined to the jaws. A thigh-bone of the
ſame animals was found entire. It weighed a
hundred pounds, and was four and a half feet
in length. Theſe tuſks and thigh-bones ſhow
that the animal muſt have been of a prodigious
magnitude. Theſe facts have been confirmed
by Mr Greenwood, who ſaw the ſix ſkeletons
in the ſalt-marſh. In the ſame place, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
found large grinders, which appeared not
to belong to the elephant, but rather to the
hippopotamus. Some of theſe teeth he ſent to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0195500109:300"/>
London, among others, two of which together
weighed 9¼ pounds. He ſays, that the jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
was too heavy to be carried by two men.
The interval between the orbits of the two
eyes was eighteen inches. An Engliſhman,
who had been taken priſoner by the ſavages,
and conducted to this ſalt-marſh in order to
teach them how to make ſalt by evaporating
the water, declared, that, from a peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,

                  <p>Some time after writing theſe letters, Mr
Collinſon read to the Royal Society of London
two ſhort eſſays on the ſame ſubject, in which I
found ſome new facts, which I ſhall relate, and
add elucidations of ſuch things as may require
explanation.</p>
                  <p>'The ſalt-marſh where the elephants bones
are found is about four miles diſtant from the
banks of the river Ohio; but it is more than
ſeven hundred miles from the neareſt coaſt of
the ſea. There is a road beaten by the wild
oxen, or biſons, large enough to allow two
chariots to travel abreaſt. This road directly
leads to the great ſalt-marſh where theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
as well as ſtags and other ſpecies of the
deer, aſſemble at a certain ſeaſon of the year
to lick the earth and drink the ſalt water. . . . .
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0195500109:301"/>
The elephants bones are found in a bank of
about ſix or ſeven feet high, which ſurrounds
the marſh. There we ſee teeth and bones
which had formerly belonged to ſome animals
of a prodigious ſize. Some of the tuſks are
near ſeven feet in length, and conſiſt of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ivory; and therefore we cannot entertain
any doubt that they really belong to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
ſpecies. It is ſingular, however, that,
among theſe tuſks, we never meet with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
grinder of an elephant, but a vaſt number
of enormous teeth, each of which has five or
ſix blunt knobs, and muſt have belonged to
ſome animal of an immenſe ſize. Theſe ſquare
teeth have no reſemblance to the grinders of
the elephant, which are flat, and four or five
times broader than thick; ſo that theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous
grinders have no reſemblance to the
teeth of any known animal.'</p>
                  <p>This laſt remark of Mr Collinſon is extremely
juſt: Theſe large grinders are totally different
from thoſe of the elephant; and, by comparing
them with the grinders of the hippopotamus,
which they reſemble by their ſquare figure, we
ſhall perceive that they likewiſe differ in ſize,
as they are two, three, and even four times
more voluminous than the largeſt teeth of the
ancient hippopotami found in Siberia and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,
though theſe laſt teeth are three or four
times larger than thoſe of the hippopotami
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0195500109:302"/>
which now exiſt. All the teeth which I have
examined in four heads of theſe animals pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the Royal Cabinet, have the grinding
ſide hollowed in the form of a card-ſpade, and
thoſe found in Canada and Siberia have the ſame
character, and differ from them in ſize only.
But thoſe enormous teeth with large blunt knobs
have always four and ſometimes five rows;
whilſt the largeſt teeth of the hippopotamus have
only three, as may be ſeen by comparing the
figures of plate CII. CIV. and CV. with thoſe of
plate CVI. It ſeems, therefore, to be certain, that
theſe large teeth have never belonged either to
the elephant or to the hippopotamus: The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in ſize, though enormous, would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
us from regarding them as pertaining to
this laſt ſpecies, if all the characters in their
form were the ſame; ſince we know, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
remarked, other ſquare teeth three or
four times larger than thoſe of the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
hippopotami, and which, having the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
ſame characters, are unqueſtionably the
teeth of hippopotami that have been three times
larger than thoſe whoſe heads are in the Royal
Cabinet. I meant thoſe large teeth, which real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong to the hippopotamus, when I remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they were equally found in both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents,
as well as the tuſks of the elephant.
It is remarkable, however, that we not only
find real tuſks of the elephant, and real teeth of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0195500109:303"/>
the large hippopotamus, in Siberia and Canada,
but we likewiſe find in the ſame countries thoſe
enormous teeth with four rows of large blunt
knobs. We may, therefore, conclude, that this
immenſe animal no longer exiſts, and that the
ſpecies is entirely extinct.</p>

                     </gap> Compte de Vergennes, miniſter and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of ſtate, was ſo obliging as to give me, in
the year 1770, the largeſt of all theſe teeth, which
is repreſented in plates CII. and CIII.; it weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
eleven pounds four ounces. This immenſe
tooth was diſcovered in making a ditch in Little
Tartary. There were other bones which could
not be collected, and, among theſe, a thigh-bone,
of which one half only was entire, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of this half contained fifteen Paris pints of
water. M. l'Abbé Chappe, of the Academy
of ſciences, brought me from Siberia a ſimilar
tooth, but ſmaller, and which weighed only three
pounds twelve and a half ounces. (Plate CIV. fig.
1. and 2.) Laſtly, the largeſt of thoſe tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me by Mr Collinſon, and which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
(plate CV.) was found, among ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
near the river Ohio in America; and they
pertectly reſemble other ſpecimens brought
from Canada.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe facts it is apparent, that, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of the elephant and hippopotamus,
whoſe relicks are equally found in the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents,
another animal common to both has
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0195500109:304"/>
formerly exiſted, the ſize of which has greatly
exceeded that of the largeſt elephants; for the
ſquare form of theſe enormous grinders ſhows,
that they were numerous in each jaw; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
there were only ſix or even four in each
ſide of the jaws, we may form ſome notion of
the magnitude of a head which could contain
ſixteen grinders, each weighing ten or eleven
pounds. The elephant has only four grinders,
two on each ſide. They are flat, and occupy
the whole jaw; and theſe two flat grinders of
the elephant ſurpaſs by two inches only the
breadth of the largeſt ſquare tooth of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
animal, which is double the thickneſs
of thoſe of the elephant. Thus every cicum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
leads us to think, that this ancient ſpecies,
which ought to be regarded as the largeſt of all
terreſtrial animals, exiſted during the firſt ages
only; for an animal much larger than the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
could not be ſo concealed in any part
of the earth as to remain perfectly unknown.
Beſides, it is evident, from the figure of theſe
teeth, as well as from the enamel, and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their roots, that they have no relation to
the teeth of the cetaceous tribes; and that they
have really belonged to a land-animal whoſe
ſpecies made a nearer approach to that of the
hippopotamus than to any other.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of his eſſay. Mr Collinſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, that ſeveral members of the Royal
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0195500109:305"/>
Society were equally well acquainted with the
elephants tuſks daily found in Siberia, upon the
banks of the Oby, and other rivers of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
What ſyſtem, he adds, can be formed,
which will, with any degree of probability, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for thoſe bones of the elephant found in
Siberia and in America? He concludes with enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating
the weight and dimenſions of all the
teeth brought from the ſalt-marſh near the river
Ohio, the largeſt of which belonged to Captain
Ourry, and weighed ſix pounds and a half.</p>
                  <p>Mr Collinſon, in his ſecond eſſay, read before
the Royal Society of London December 10. 1767,
remarks, that, as one of the tuſks found in the
ſalt-marſh was ſtriated or furrowed near the
thickeſt end, he entertained ſome doubts whether
theſe furrows were peculiar to the elephant ſpecies.
To ſatisfy himſelf on this head, he viſited the
warehouſe of a merchant who dealt in all kinds
of teeth; and, after examining them, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
that there were as many tuſks furrowed
as ſmooth at the thick end; and, of courſe, he
had no difficulty in pronouncing, that the tuſks
found in America were, in every reſpect, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to thoſe of the African and Aſiatic elephants.
But, as the large American ſquare teeth have
no relation to the grinders of the elephant, he
thinks, that they are the remains of ſome enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
animal which had tuſks like an elephant,
and grinders peculiar to its own ſpecies, their
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0195500109:306"/>
magnitude and form being totally different from
thoſe of any known animal<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. 1767.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1748, M. Fabri, who had made
great excurſions into the northern parts of Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiana
and the ſouthern regions of Canada, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
me, that he had ſeen heads and ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
of an enormous quadruped, called by the
Savages the <hi>father of Oxen</hi>; and that the thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones
of theſe animals were from five to ſix
feet in length. Some time after, and previous
to the year 1767 ſpecimens of theſe large teeth
belonging to the unknown animal, as well as
thoſe of the hippopotamus, and bones of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant,
all found in America, were tranſmitted
to Paris. The number of them is too conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to leave any doubt that theſe animals for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
exiſted in the northern regions of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
as well as in thoſe of Europe and Aſia.</p>
                  <p>But elephants have likewiſe exiſted in all the
temperate countries of our Continent. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
tuſks found in Languedoc near Simore,
and thoſe diſcovered in Cominges in Gaſcony.
To theſe I ſhall add the largeſt and fineſt of the
whole, lately ſent to the Royal Cabinet by the
Duc de la Rochefoucauld, whoſe zeal for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
ſcience is a reſult of his general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
This excellent ſpecimen he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>found, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with M. Deſmarets of the Academy of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0195500109:307"/>
when viewing the fields in the environs
of Rome. This tuſk was divided into five frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which the Duc de la Rochfoucauld or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be collected. One of theſe fragments
was ſtolen by the porter who had the charge of
it, and there remained only four, which were
about eight inches in diameter. When laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
theſe four fragments were ſeven feet
in length; and we learn from M. Deſmarets,
that the fifth fragment, which was loſt, was
near three feet long. Hence the total length
of the tuſk muſt have been about ten feet. By
examining the broken ends, we diſcovered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
character of elephantine ivory; though, by
being long buried under ground, it has become
light and friable, like all other foſſil ivories.</p>
                  <p>M. Tozzetti, a learned Italian naturaliſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
that there were found, in the valleys of
Arno, the bones of elephants and other terreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial
animals in great quantities, ſcattered here
and there in the ſtrata of the earth. We may,
therefore, he remarks, conclude, that elephants
were formerly natives of Europe, and eſpecially
of Tuſcany<note n="*" place="bottom">Extrait d'une lettre du Docteur Tozzetti, Journal étran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, mois de Decembre 1755.</note>.</p>
                  <p>'We found,' ſays M. Caliellini, 'about the
end of November 1759, in a country eſtate
belonging to the Marquis de Petrella, ſituated
at Fuſigliano in the territory of Cortona, a

In the ſame manner, we find in France, and
in all the other nations of Europe, ſkeletons and
vertebrae of marine animals, which can only
ſubſiſt in the moſt ſouthern ſeas. The ſame
change of temperature, therefore, has happened
in the various parts of the ocean as well as in
thoſe of the land; and this ſecond fact, like the
firſt, as it proceeds from the ſame cauſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the whole.</p>
                  <p>When we compare thoſe ancient monuments
of the firſt age of animated nature with her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
productions, we evidently perceive that the
conſtituent form of each animal has remained
the ſame, and that there is no alteration in the
principal parts of their ſtructure. The type of
each ſpecies has ſuffered no change. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mould has invariably preſerved its form.
However long we may ſuppoſe the ſucceſſion of
time, whatever number of generations may have
paſſed, the individuals of each kind ſtill exhibit
the ſame forms as thoſe of the firſt ages, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the larger ſpecies, whoſe characters are
more fixed, and whoſe nature is more permanent;
for the inferior ſpecies have, as formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
been ſenſibly affected by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
cauſes of degeneration. We muſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
remark, with regard to the larger ſpecies,
ſuch as the elephant and hippopotamus, that, by
comparing their ancient remains with thoſe of
our times, we, in general, perceive that theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0195500109:310"/>
were then much larger than they are at
preſent. Nature was then in her primitive vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.
The internal heat of the earth beſtowed
on its productions all the vigour and magnitude
of which they were ſuſceptible. The firſt ages
produced giants of every kind. Dwarfs and
pigmies ſucceeded, after the earth had cooled;
and if, as other monuments ſeems to indicate,
ſome ſpecies of animals, which formerly exiſted,
are now loſt, this effect could only be produced,
becauſe their nature required a greater degree of
heat than what is now felt in the torrid zone.
Thoſe enormous and nearly ſquare grinders with
blunt knobs, thoſe large cornua ammonis, of
which ſome are ſeveral feet in diameter, and
many other foſſil fiſhes and ſhells, which no
longer have any living repreſentatives, exiſted
only in thoſe primitive times when the earth
and ſea were ſtill warm, and produced and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
animals to whom this degree of heat was
neceſſary, and who exiſt not at preſent, becauſe
they have probably periſhed by cold.</p>
                  <p>To know all the petrifactions of which there
are no living repreſentatives, would require long
ſtudy and an exact compariſon of the various
ſpecies of petrified bodies, which have been
found in the bowels of the earth. This ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is ſtill in its infancy. We are certain,
however, that there are many of thoſe ſpecies,
ſuch as, the cornua ammonis, ortoceratites, len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0195500109:311"/>
and numiſmal ſtones, belemnites, Judaic
ſtones, anthropomorphites, &amp;c. which cannot
be referred to any ſpecies now exiſting. We
have ſeen cornua ammonis of two and three feet
in diameter; and we have been aſſured by men
worthy of credit, that a cornua ammonis has been
found in Champagne larger than a mill-ſtone,
ſince it was eight feet in diameter and one foot
thick. I had an offer of its being ſent to me.
But the enormous weight of this maſs, which
is 8000 pounds, and its great diſtance from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
prevented me from accepting the preſent.
Theſe examples, and others which might be
given, are ſufficient to ſhow, that many ſpecies
of ſhell and cruſtaceous animals formerly exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſea, of which there are now no living
repreſentatives. The ſame obſervation is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to ſome of the ſcaly fiſhes. Moſt of
thoſe found in certain ſlates have ſo little reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to the fiſhes with which we are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that their ſpecies cannot be aſcertained. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thoſe in the Royal Cabinet, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
preſerved in maſſes of ſtone, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to any of our known ſpecies. It appears,
therefore, that the ſea formerly nouriſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
genera, whoſe ſpecies no longer exiſt.</p>
                  <p>But, with regard to terreſtrial animals, we
have only a ſingle example of a loſt ſpecies,
and it appears to have been the largeſt, without
excepting even the elephant: And, ſince the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0195500109:312"/>
examples of loſt ſpecies are more rare in land
than in marine animals, is it not probable, that
the production of the former was poſterior to
that of the latter?</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts and monuments we may
perceive ſix ſucceſſive epochs in the firſt ages of
Nature; ſix ſpecies of duration, the limits of
which, though indeterminate, are not the leſs
real; for theſe epochs are not, like thoſe of
civil hiſtory, marked by ſixed points, or limited
by centuries and other portions of time which
admit of an exact meaſurement. They may,
however, be compared between themſelves, and
their relative duration may be eſtimated by other
facts and monuments, which indicate contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
dates.</p>

is apparent in the whole circumference of

M. Lehman, a celebrated chymiſt, is the firſt
perſon who ſuſpected that metallic ſubſtances had
a double origin. 'Gold and ſilver,' he remarks,
'are found in maſſes only in the mountains
which have veins, and iron is found only in
thoſe mountains which have regular ſtrata.
All the ſmall pieces of gold and ſilver found
in the mountains with ſtrata have been detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from veins in the ſuperior mountains in
the neighbourhood of the former.'</p>
                  <p>'Gold is never in the form of ore. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found in a native or virgin ſtate, though
it is often ſcattered about in particles ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
that it cannot be diſtinguiſhed even by
the beſt microſcopes. In the mountains with
ſtrata, no gold, and very little ſilver, are to be
found. Theſe two metals belong excluſively
to mountains with veins. Sometimes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
we find ſilver in ſmall leaves, or under
the form of hair, in ſlate. Native copper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener
occurs in ſlate; and this copper is alſo
commonly in the form of threads or hair.'</p>
                  <p>'A few years after iron-ores have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the earth, they are reproduced.
They are not found in the mountains with

                  <p>'With regard to native tin, it has no exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                  <p>'Native mercury is found in ſtrata of fat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillaceous
earth, or in ſlate.'</p>
                  <p>'The ſilver ores found in ſlate are not nearly
ſo rich as thoſe found in the mountains with
veins. This metal is found in beds of ſlate;
and is always in the form of minute particles,
threads, or ramifications, but never appears in
large maſſes. Theſe beds of ſlate muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be adjacent to the mountains with veins.
The ſilver-ores found in ſtrata are never in a
ſolid or compact form. All the other ores,
which contain much ſilver, are peculiar to the
mountains with veins. There is a great deal
of ſilver in the ſtrata of ſlate; and it is alſo
ſometimes found in pit-coal.'</p>
                  <p>'Tin is the metal which moſt rarely appears
in ſtrata; lead is more common in that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We find it attached to ſlate, but never
to coal.'</p>
                  <p>'Iron is almoſt univerſally diffuſed, and is
found in beds under a number of different
forms.'</p>
                  <p>'Cinnabar, cobalt, biſmuth, and lapis cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris,

                  <p>'Pit-coal, jett, amber, and aluminous earth,

for we often find, above the ſtrata of
coal, wood which is not totally decompoſed; and

&amp;c. It is remarkable, that all theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
belong to foreign plants, and the wood
likewiſe appears to be foreign. Amber, which
ought to be regarded as a vegetable reſin, often
includes inſects, which, when attentively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,

                  <p>In the ſecond epoch of Nature, the Count
de Buffon remarks, 'that, in the northern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0195500109:320"/>
there are mountains compoſed entirely
of iron.' I mention, ſays he, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the iron mines near Taberg in Smoland,
a part of the iſland of Gothland in Sweden.
It is the moſt remarkable of thoſe mines, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mountains of iron which have the quality
of yielding to the attraction of the load-ſtone;
which proves that they have been formed by
the action of fire. The baſis of this mountain
is a very fine ſand. Its height is more than
400 feet, and its circumference about one league.
It is compoſed entirely of a rich ferruginous
matter, and we even find in it native iron, which
is another proof that it has undergone the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a violent fire. This ore, when broken,
exhibits ſmall ſhining particles, which ſometimes
croſs each other, and ſometimes are arranged
like ſcales. This mine has been wrought above
two hundred years.</p>
                  <p>The ore in this mountain is not diſpoſed in
regular beds; neither is the iron every where of
equal goodneſs. Through the whole mountain
there are fiſſſures ſometimes perpendicular, and
ſometimes horizontal: Theſe are all filled with
ſand, which contains no iron. This ſand is
pure, and of the ſame ſpecies with that on the
ſea-coaſt. In this ſand, we ſometimes find the
bones of animals, and the horns of ſtags, which
ſhows that the ſand has been carried thither by
the waters, and that the formation of this iron
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0195500109:321"/>
mountain by fire happened before the crevices
and the perpendicular and horizontal fiſſures
were filled with ſand.</p>
                  <p>The maſſes of ore are rolled down from the
top of the mountain; but, in other mines, the
minerals muſt be drawn up from the bowels of
the earth. This o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We are next informed, that there are moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of load-ſtone in ſome countries, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in thoſe of the North. From the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
example, we have ſeen that the iron
mountain of Taberg riſes 400 feet above the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
of the ſea. M. Gmelin, in his travels through
Siberia, remarks, that, in the northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of Aſia, almoſt all the metallic ores are
found on the ſurface of the earth, whilſt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
countries they are buried deep in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
parts of the earth. This fact, if generally
true, is a new proof that metals have been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the primitive fire, and that the globe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0195500109:322"/>
leſs thick in the northern regions, metals
were formed nearer the ſurface than in the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
countries.</p>
                  <p>M. Gmelin examined the great mountain of
loadſtone among the Baſchkires in Siberia.
This mountain is divided into eight parts by
valleys, of which the ſeventh part produces the
beſt loadſtone. The ſummit of this portion of
the mountain conſiſts of a yellowiſh ſtone, which
ſeems to partake of the nature of jaſper. We
there find ſtones that have the appearance of
free-ſtone, which weight from two to three
thouſand pounds; but they all have a magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
virtue. Though covered with moſs, they
fail not, at more than the diſtance of an inch,
to attract iron and ſteel. The ſides expoſed to
the air have the ſtrongeſt magnetic power, thoſe
covered with the earth being much weaker.
Thoſe parts which are expoſed to the injuries of
the air are ſofter, and, conſequently, leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for being armed. A large portion of load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
of the ſize above mentioned, is compoſed
of a number of other portions which act in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
directions. To work them properly,
they ſhould be ſeparated in ſuch a manner that
the whole portion, which includes the virtue of
each particular magnet, ſhould preſerve its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
By obſerving this rule, we would probably
obtain magnets of an uncommon ſtrength. But,
as they are cut without any foreſight, many
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0195500109:323"/>
portions are of no value, either becauſe they
contain little no magnetic power, or becauſe,
in a ſingle piece, there are two or three mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
united: Such portions have indeed a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic
virtue; but, as it is not directed to the
ſame point, a magnet of this kind muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to great variations.</p>
                  <p>The loadſtone of this mountain, except what
is expoſed to the air, is exceedingly hard, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with black, and full of little knots or protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances,
conſiſting of ſmall angular parts, like
thoſe often obſervable on the ſurface of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
from which it differs only in colour; but,
inſtead of theſe angular parts, we ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a kind of ochrey earth. In general, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones
with theſe angular parts have leſs power
than the other kinds. That part of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
where the loadſtones are found is compoſed
almoſt entirely of a fine iron ore, which lies in
ſmall portions among the loadſtones. The
whole ſection of the high part of the mountain
contains a ſimilar ore; but, in proportion as we
deſcend, the metal is more rare. Below the
ore of loadſtone, there are other ferruginous
ſtones, which, if melted, would produce very
little iron. Theſe ſtones have the colour of
metal, and are very heavy. Their interior
parts are irregular, and have nearly the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſcoriae. In their ſurfaces they pretty
much reſemble loadſtones; but they have no
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0195500109:324"/>
magnetic power. Between theſe ſtones there are
other pieces of rock which appear to be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of ſmall particles of iron. The ſtone itſelf
is heavy, but very ſoft. The interior parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
burned matter, and they have little or
no magnetic virtue. We likewiſe meet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
with a brown iron ore in beds of an
inch thick; but it yields very little metal<note n="*" place="bottom">Extrait d'Hiſt. generale des voyages, tom. 18. p. 141. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the mountains of Poias in Siberia, there
are ſeveral other mines of loadſtone. Ten
leagues off the road which leads from Catharin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg
to Salikamſkaia, there is a hill called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazinſki,</hi>
which is more than twenty fathoms
high, and is entirely compoſed of a loadſtone
rock. It has the brown colour and the denſity
of iron.</p>
                  <p>Twenty leagues from Salikamſkaia, we find
cubical loadſtones of a brilliant greeniſh colour.
When pulveriſed, the grains have the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of fire. It is worthy of remark, that load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
is found only in thoſe chains of mountains
which ſtretch from ſouth to north<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. tom. 19. p. 472.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the countries bordering upon Lapland, and
on the confines of Bothnia, two leagues diſtant
from Cokluanda, there is an iron-ore, from
which very fine loadſtones are extracted. 'We
admired,' ſays Regnard, 'the ſurpriſing effects

of this ſtone, when it remained in its natural

the large hammer employed remained ſo fixed
to the wedge in the ſtone, that the workman
required aſſiſtance to diſengage it. I tried the

which was ſo heavy that I could hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

it was attracted and ſupported with an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing

I advanced, from the authority of Woodward,
who firſt collected facts upon this ſubject, that
ſhells were likewiſe found on the tops of the

as well as thoſe of others, I know, that there
are ſhells in the Alps and Pyrennees at 900,
1000, 1200, and 1500 fathoms above the level
of the ſea; that they are likewiſe found in the
mountains of Aſia; and, laſtly, in the Cordeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres
of America, a bank of ſhells has lately been
diſcovered at the height of more than 2000 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
above the ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">M. le Gentil, of the academy of Sciences, wrote me the following letter, in December 1771: 'Don Antonia Ulloa deſired me, when departing from Cadiz, to ſend him two petrified ſhells, which, in the year 1761, he had dug out of the mountain that contains the quick ſilver mines. This mountain is in the government of Ouanca-Velica in Peru. Its ſouthern latitude is from 13 to 14 degrees. At the place where theſe ſhells are found, the mercury ſtood at 17 inches 1¼ line, which correſponds to the height of 2222⅓ fathoms above the level of the ſea.'
'At the top of the mountain, which is far from being the higheſt in this canton, the mercury ſtands at 16½ inches, which implies a height of 2337 2/8 fathoms.'
'In the town of Ouanca-Velica, the mercury ſtands at 18 inches 1½ line, which gives a height of 1949 fathoms.'
'Don Antonio Ulloa informed me, that he detached theſe ſhells from a very thick bank, the extent of which he did not know: The ſhells are of the large pilgrim or ſcallop kind.'</note>.</p>
                  <p>It is, therefore, certain, that, in all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts of the world, and even to the height
of 1500 or 2000 fathoms above the preſent le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0195500109:327"/>
of the ſea, the ſurface of the globe has been
covered with the waters, and that they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long enough for the production and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of ſhell-animals; for the quantity of
them is ſo great, that their ſpoils often form
large banks, which extend many miles in length.
They compoſe a conſiderable part of the exterior
ſtrata of the earth; for calcarious ſubſtances,
or the ſpoils of ſhells, are very common in moſt
countries. But, at high points of elevation,
<hi>i. e.</hi> above 1500 or 2000 fathoms, the ſummits
of the mountains generally conſiſt of pure rock,
granite, and other vitrifiable bodies produced
by the primitive fire, which contain no ſhells,
madrepores, or any thing that has a relation to
calcarious ſubſtances. We may, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the ſea has never reached, or at leaſt
for a ſhort time only, thoſe moſt elevated parts
of the earth.</p>
                  <p>To ſupport the teſtimony of Don Ulloa, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſhells found in the Cordelieres, we
ſhall add that of Alphonſo Barba. He tells us,
that, in the moſt mountainous part of Peru, there
are ſhells of all ſizes, ſome of them concave, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
convex, and the whole finely impreſſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Metallurgie d'Alphonſo Barba, tom. 1. p. 64.</note>.
Hence America, as well as the other quarters of
the globe, has been covered with the waters of
the ſea. The firſt obſervers were probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to think that no ſhells were to be found
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0195500109:328"/>
in the Cordelieres, becauſe moſt of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which are the higheſt on this globe, are
either active or extinguiſhed volcano's, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of which have covered all the adjacent
countries with burned ſubſtances: Of courſe,
all the ſhells which might have been found
there, are not only buried, but completely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
It is not, therefore, ſurpriſing that no
marine productions have been diſcovered around
theſe mountains, which either are at preſent, or
have formerly been volcano's; for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
which ſurround theſe mountains muſt
be compoſed entirely of aſhes, ſcoriae, glaſs, lava,
and other burned or vitrified bodies. Thus the
notion that the ſea never covered the mountains,
has no other foundation than this circumſtance,
that, on the tops of ſeveral of them, no ſhells or
other productions of the ſea are now to be ſeen.
But, as we find, in an infinite number of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and even as high as 1500 or 2000 fathoms,
ſhells and other ſea-bodies, it is evident, that
there are few ridges of mountains which have
not been covered with the ocean; and that the
ſpots where no ſhells appear only ſhow that the
animals which produce them have never dwelt
there, or that the motion of the waters has not
tranſported thither marine productions, as it has
done in every other part of the globe.</p>

There are many examples of plants growing in

fiſhes in water the heat of which was ſo great

earthy and ferruginous. Several baths are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
along this brook, and their degrees of
heat are proportioned to their diſtance from its
ſource. When I viſited the firſt bath, my
ſurpriſe was increaſed: In this water, which
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0195500109:330"/>
was ſo hot that I durſt not plunge my hand
into it, I ſaw fiſhes ſwimming. I uſed every

and the want of addreſs in the people,
prevented me from ſucceeding. I examined
them in the water; but I could not diſtinguiſh
their genus, on account of the vapour riſing
from the water. They had brown ſcales,
and the largeſt of them were about four inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
long. I could not learn how theſe fiſhes
had got into the baths.' The teſtimony of
M. Sonnerat is ſtrengthened by that of M. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt,

bones and teeth of a prodigious ſize: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

4 in length. Having conſulted the moſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
people of the country, they concluded
that the head could not be leſs than a yard
broad<note n="†" place="bottom">Waffer's travels in America, p. 367.</note>.</p>
                  <p>It is, perhaps, the ſame head which Acoſta
mentions: 'I ſaw,' ſays he, 'a grinder which
aſtoniſhed me by its enormous ſize; for it was
as large as a man's fiſt.' P. Torquemado, a
Franciſcan, relates, that he had in his poſſeſſion
a grinder, twice as large as a man's fiſt, and
which weighed two pounds. He adds, that, in
the city of Mexico, and in the Convent of St
Auguſtine, he ſaw a thigh bone ſo large, that the
individual to which it belonged muſt have been
from 11 to 12 cubits high, <hi>i. e.</hi> 17 or 18 feet;
and that the head muſt have been as big
as one of the large pitchers uſed in Caſtille
for holding wine.</p>
                  <p>Phillippe Hernandés informs us, that there
were found, at Tezcaco and Toſuca, ſeveral
bones of an extraordinary magnitude; and that
among theſe there are grinding teeth five inches
broad and ten high; from which he concludes,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0195500109:334"/>
that the ſize of the head muſt have been ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous
that two men could not have embraced
it with their arms. Don Lorenzo Boturini Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naduci
likewiſe tells us, that, in New Spain, and
particularly in the heights of Santa fé, and in
the territories of Puebla and Ttlaſcala, they find
enormous bones, and grinders, one of which,
preſerved in the Royal Cabinet, is a hundred
times larger than the largeſt human teeth<note n="*" place="bottom">Gigantologie Eſpagnole, par le P. Torrubia, Journal é<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranger, Nov. 1760.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The author of this Gigantologie Eſpagnole
attributes theſe enormous teeth and bones to
giants of the human ſpecies. But, is it credible
that men ever exiſted whoſe heads were eight
or ten feet in circumference? Is it not equally
aſtoniſhing that, in the ſpecies of the hippopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus
or elephant, there have been individuals
of this magnitude? We are, therefore, led to
think, that theſe enormous teeth are of the ſame
kind with thoſe lately found in Canada near the
river Ohio, which we aſcribed to an unknown
animal, whoſe ſpecies formerly exiſted in Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
in Siberia, and in Canada, and which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Illionois as far as Mexico. As
the Spaniſh authors mention not that elephants
tuſks were found in New Spain along with
theſe large grinders, it is probable that a ſpecies
different from that of the elephant formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0195500109:335"/>
there, to which theſe large grinders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
and that this ſpecies was diffuſed as far
as Mexico. Beſides, the large teeth of the hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popotamus
ſeem to have been anciently known;
for St Auguſtine tells us, that he ſaw a grinder
ſo large, that, if divided, it would have made a
hundred teeth of an ordinary man<note n="*" place="bottom">De Civitate Dei, lib. 15. cap. 9.</note>. Fulgoſa
likewiſe remarks, that teeth were found in Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
each of which weighed three pounds<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>John Sommer relates, that he found, near Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
in Canterbury, at the depth of ſeventeen
feet below the ſurface of the earth, monſtrous
bones, ſome of them entire, and others broken.
He likewiſe found four entire teeth, each of
them weighing more than half a pound, and
nearly as large as a man's fiſt. The whole
four were grinders, and, except in magnitude,
they pretty much reſembled human teeth. He
farther remarks, that Louis Vives mentions a
grinder ſtill larger, which was ſhewn him for a
tooth of St Chriſtopher. He adds, that Acoſta
ſaw in India a ſimilar tooth dug out of the earth,
along with ſeveral other bones, which, when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged
in proper order, repreſented a man of
a monſtrous ſtature. We might have formed
the ſame idea, ſays Mr Sommer, concerning the
teeth dug out of the earth near Canterbury, if
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0195500109:336"/>
bones had not been found in the ſame place,
which could not belong to the human ſpecies.
Several perſons who examined theſe bones, jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to be the bones and teeth of the hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popotamus.
Two of theſe teeth are engraved
in the philoſophical tranſactions, No. 272. fig. 9.</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts we may conclude, that moſt
of thoſe large bones found under the ſurface of
the earth belong to the elephant and hippopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:
But it ſeems to be certain, that, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the enormous teeth with blunt knobs,
with thoſe of the elephant and hippopotamus,
they have belonged to an animal much larger
than either, and that the ſpecies of this prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
animal no longer exiſts.</p>
                  <p>Among the preſent elephants it is extremely
rare to find a tuſk of ſix feet in length. The
longeſt are generally from five to ſix and a half
feet; and, of courſe, the ancient elephant, which
produced a tuſk of ten feet long, whoſe frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are in our poſſeſſion, was a gigantic ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
The immenſe thigh-bone in the Royal
Cabinet confirms the ſame concluſions.</p>
                  <p>The ſame remark is applicable to the ſpecies
of the hippopotamus. I cauſed two of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
grinders to be extracted from the largeſt
head of the hippopotamus in the Royal Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:
One of them weighed ten, and the other
nine and a half ounces. I then weighed two
teeth, the one found in Siberia, and the other in
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0195500109:337"/>
Canada. The firſt weighed two pounds twelve
ounces, and the ſecond two pounds two ounces.
Hence theſe ancient hippopotamis were gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
when compared with thoſe now exiſting.</p>
                  <p>The example already given of the enormous
petrified head of an ox, found in the environs
of Rome, proves, that there have likewiſe been
prodigious giants in this ſpecies of quadruped,
which we are alſo enabled to ſhow, by ſeveral
other monuments of antiquity. In the Royal
Cabinet, we have, 1. A fine greeniſh horn,
which is very ſmooth and well turned, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
belongs to the ox. The circumference
at the baſe is 25, and its length 42 inches. Its
cavity contains 11¼ Paris pints of liquor; 2.
The core, or internal bone of an ox's horn,
which weighs ſeven pounds; whilſt the largeſt
core of the horns of our oxen exceeds not the
weight of one pound: This internal bone was
preſented to the Royal Cabinet by M. le Comte
de Treſſan, a man of taſte, and a good Natural
hiſtorian; 3. Two internal bones of an ox's
horn attached to a portion of the crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
were found in beds of turf, at the depth
of 25 feet, between Amiens and Abbeville,
and tranſmitted to me for the Royal Cabinet.
The whole weighed 17 pounds; and each horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
when ſeparated from the cranium, weighed
at leaſt 7½ pounds. I compared the dimenſions,
as well as the weight of theſe different bones;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0195500109:338"/>
that of the largeſt ox to be found in Paris was
only 13 inches long, and 7 in circumference at
the baſe. But, of the two dug out of the earth,
the one was 24 inches long, and 12 in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
at the baſe, and the other 27 inches
in length, and 13 in circumference. Theſe facts
are more than ſufficient to ſhew, that, in the
ſpecies of the ox, as well as in thoſe of the hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popotamus
and elephant, prodigious giants have
formerly exiſted.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the human ſpecies, individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
giants have been produced not only in Aſia,
but in every climate; for, even in our own days,
we ſee gigantic men in every country. We
lately ſaw a giant who was born in Finland, on
the very confines of Lapland. But we are not
equally certain, that permanent races, and far
leſs entire nations of giants, ever exiſted. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the teſtimony of ancient authors, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
thoſe of Holy Writ, ſeem clearly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
that races of giants formerly exiſted in
Aſia. In the book of Numbers, chap. 13. verſe
33. it is ſaid, <hi>And there we ſaw giants, the
ſons of Anak, which came of the giants: and we
were in our own ſight as graſhoppers, and ſo
we were in their ſight.</hi> Though this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may have the appearance of exaggeration,
which is common in the oriental ſtyle, it is
plain that theſe giants were very large.</p>
                  <p>In 2 Samuel, chap. 21. verſe 20. a giant is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0195500109:339"/>
mentioned of the race and family of Goliah,
who had ſix fingers and toes on his hands and
feet: In the ſame book, there are ſeveral other
paſſages which prove the exiſtence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of giants.</p>
                  <p>In Joſhua, chap. 2. verſe 22. it is ſaid, that
<hi>there was none of</hi> the giants of the race <hi>of the
Anakims left in the land of the children of Iſrael;
only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Aſhdod, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Philo, St Cyrillus, and ſeveral other authors,
ſeem to think, that the word <hi>giants</hi> means only
proud and impious men, and not men of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſtature. But there is no foundation
for this opinion; ſince the amazing height and
ſtrength of theſe men are often deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The prophet Amos informs us, that the Lord
<hi>deſtroyed the Amorite, whoſe height was like the
height of cedars, and he was ſtrong as the oaks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ogg, king of Baſhan, was nine cubits high,
and Goliah ten cubits and one palm. Ogg's bed
was nine cubits, or thirteen and a half feet long,
and four cubits, or ſix feet, broad. The breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
of Goliah weighed 208 pounds 4 ounces,
and the blade of his lance 25 pounds.</p>
                  <p>Theſe evidences are ſufficient to prove, that
there formerly exiſted in the continent of Aſia,
not only individuals, but races of giants, who
have been deſtroyed, and the laſt of whom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the days of King David. Nature, who
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0195500109:340"/>
never loſes any of her rights, ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
her former powers of production; for, in
almoſt every climate, men of an extraordinary
ſtature, <hi>i. e.</hi> of ſeven and a half, eight, and even
nine feet high, occaſionally appear. Beſide the
examples already given, many others are to be
found, both in ancient and modern authors, of
giants of ten, twelve, fifteen, and eighteen feet
high. But theſe laſt dimenſions, I am perſuaded,
ought to be greatly reduced. The bones of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
have often been miſtaken for human
bones. Beſides, Nature, in her preſent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
preſents no ſpecies with ſuch great diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
except, perhaps, that of the hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamus;
for the teeth of thoſe found in the
bowels of the earth are at leaſt four times larger
than the teeth of the hippopotamus which now
exiſts.</p>
                  <p>The bones of the ſuppoſed king Teutobochus,
found in Dauphiny, gave riſe to a diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Habicot, a ſurgeon in Paris, and Riolan,
the favous anatomiſt. Habicot, in his <hi>Gigantoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie,</hi>
tells us, that theſe bones were taken out
of a brick ſepulchre, 18 feet below ground, and
ſurrounded with ſand. He neither gives an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
deſcription, nor the number of theſe bones.
He aſſerts that they are human, becauſe they
belonged to no other animal. He adds, that
ſome maſons, when working to Seignio Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
a gentleman of Dauphiny, on the 11th
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0195500109:341"/>
day of January 1613, diſcovered this tomb near
the ruins of the caſtle of Chaumont; that the
tomb was built with brick; that it was 30 feet
long, 12 broad, and 8 high; that is was covered
with a gray ſtone, on the middle of which was
engraved, <hi>Theutobochus rex</hi>; that, when the
tomb was opened, a human ſkeleton appeared,
which was 25½ feet long, 10 broad at the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and 5 thick; that, before touching theſe
bones, the head was meaſured, and it was 5 feet
in length, and 10 in circumference. Here it is
worthy of remark, that the proportion between
the length of a human head and that of the
body, is not a fifth, but a ſeventh and one half;
ſo that this head of 5 ſeet ſuppoſes the body to
have been 37½ feet in length. Laſtly, Habicot
tells us, that the under jaw was 6 feet round,
and the orbits of the eyes 7 inches; that each
clavicle was 7 feet long; and that moſt of
theſe bones, after being expoſed to the air, crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
into duſt.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year 1613, Dr Riolan publiſhed a
tract under the title of <hi>Gigantomachie,</hi> in which
he maintains, that Habicot, in his Gigantoſteol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
had given falſe meaſures of the body and bones
of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e pretended giant Teutobochus; that Riolan
meaſured the thigh-bone and the bone of the
leg together with the aſtragalus joined to the
calcaneum; that they exceeded not 6½ feet, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
including the os pubis; and, of courſe, that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0195500109:342"/>
the length of the giant could be only 13 feet,
inſtead of 25. He then gives his reaſons for
denying theſe bones to be human; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that the bones exhibited by Habicot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to man, but to the elephant.</p>
                  <p>A year after the publication of Habicot's
Gigantoſteologie and Riolan's Gigantomachie, a
pamphlet appeared under the title of <hi>the Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
concerning ſuppoſed human bones falſely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to King Teutobochus, diſcovered.</hi> In
this pamphlet, the bones are denied to be human,
and ſuppoſed to have been engendered by ſome
virtue in the earth. Another pamphlet was
publiſhed without a name, in which it is ſaid,
that, among theſe bones, ſome were human and
others not.</p>
                  <p>In 1618, Riolan publiſhed his <hi>Gigantologie,</hi> in
which he maintains, that the bones in queſtion
were not only not human, but that men, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
were never larger than they are at preſent.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year, Habicot replied to Riolan:
He ſays, that he preſented his Gigantoſteologie
to Louis XIII.; that, about the end of July in the
year 1613, the bones mentioned in this work were
expoſed to the eye of the public; and that they
are real human bones. He quotes a number of
examples from ancient and modern authors, to
prove that men of immenſe ſtature have exiſted.
He perſiſts in maintaining, that the calcaneum,
tibia, and femur of the giant Teutobochus, when
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0195500109:343"/>
joined to each other, were more than 11 feet in
length.</p>
                  <p>He next gives letters written to him at the
time theſe bones were diſcovered, and which
ſeem to confirm the reality both of the tomb
and of the bones of the giant Teutobochus.
From a letter written by Seignior de Langon,
dated St Marcellin, in Dauphiny, and another by
the Sieur Maſurier, a ſurgeon at Beaurepaire, it
appears, that ſilver coins were found along with
the bones. The firſt letter contains the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſage: 'As his Majeſty,' ſays Seignior de
Langon, 'is deſirous of having the remaining
bones of King Teutobochus, and the ſilver coins
found in the tomb, I declare, that your adverſaries
are ill informed, and that, if they knew the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more perfectly, they would not entertain
any doubts that theſe bones really belong to the
human ſpecies. The phyſicians of Montpellier
came here, and would have given any money
to purchaſe the bones. M. le Maréchal de
Leſdiguieres made them be carried to Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble;
and the phyſicians and ſurgeons of that
place recogniſed them to be human bones.
This fact, of courſe, can only be denied by
perſons who are ignorant of the real circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.'</p>
                  <p>In this diſpute, neither Riolan nor Habicot,
the one a phyſician and the other a ſurgeon,
have had ſenſe enough to give an exact deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0195500109:344"/>
of the bones in queſtion. Both of them,
actuated by paſſion and a party-ſpirit, have
written in a ſtyle which deſtroys all confidence
in their aſſertions. Hence it is extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to aſcertain the ſpecies to which theſe
bones really belonged. But, if they were found
in a brick tomb, with a ſtone cover, upon which
the words <hi>Teutobochus Rex</hi> were inſcribed; if
coins were found in this tomb; if it contained
but a ſingle ſkeleton of 24 or 25 feet in length;
and, if Seignior Langon's letter relates nothing
but truth, the general fact, <hi>i. e.</hi> the exiſtence of
a giant of 24 feet high, unleſs we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a very extraordinary concourſe of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
could not admit of a doubt. But the
fact is by no means proved, in a manner ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
as not to leave room for much heſitation.
It is true, that ſeveral authors, otherwiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of credit, have mentioned giants as large,
and even larger. Pliny relates<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 7. cap. 16.</note>, that, by an
earthquake in Crete, a mountain was ſplit, and
diſcovered a human body of 16 cubits long,
which ſome aſcribed to that of Otus, and others
to that of Orion. 16 cubits are equal to 24
feet, which is the ſame length with the ſkeleton
of King Teutobochus.</p>
                  <p>In a Memoir of M. le Cat, an Academician
of Rouen, we have an enumeration of ſeveral
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0195500109:345"/>
giants of enormous magnitude, namely, two,
whoſe ſkeletons were found near Athens, of
which one was 36 and the other 34 feet high;
another of 30 feet was found in Sicily near Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo,
in the year 1548; another of 33 feet
was likewiſe found in Sicily in the year 1550;
and another was alſo found in Sicily, near Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarino,
which was thirty feet long.</p>
                  <p>Theſe teſtimonies notwithſtanding, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to believe that men of 30 or 36 feet high
ever exiſted: It is perhaps too much to believe
in the exiſtence of giants of 24 feet high.
However, evidences multiply, become more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive,
and gradually increaſe, in proportion as
the dimenſions decreaſe. M. le Cat relates, that,
in the year 1705, there was found, near the
banks of the river Morderi, at the foot of Mount
Cruſſol, the ſkeleton of a giant which meaſured
22½ feet; and that the Dominicans of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
have part of the tibia with the joint of the
knee.</p>
                  <p>Platerus, a celebrated phyſician, aſſerts, that
he ſaw at Lucerne the ſkeleton of a man, which
was 19 feet in length.</p>
                  <p>The giant Ferragus, ſlain by Rolland, nephew
to Charlemagne, was 18 feet high.</p>
                  <p>In the ſepulchral caverns of the iſland of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriff,
a ſkeleton was found, which meaſured 15
feet, and in whoſe jaws were 80 teeth. Theſe
three facts, as well as the preceding, are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0195500109:346"/>
in M. le Cat's eſſay concerning giants. He
mentions another ſkeleton found in a ditch near
the convent of the Dominicans at Rouen, the
ſkull of which held a buſhel of corn, and the
bone of the leg was 4 feet long: The whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
of courſe, muſt have been from 17 to 18
feet in length. Upon the tomb of this giant,
the following inſcription was engraved: <hi>Here
lies the noble and puiſſant Seigniur le Chevalier
Ricon de Valmont, together with his bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Journal Littéraire of Abbé Nazari,
we are told, that, in High Calabria, in the
month of July 1665, there was dug out of
the gardens of Signior de Tiviolo, a ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of 18 Roman feet long; that the head was
2½ feet; that each grinder weighed about an
ounce and a third, and the other teeth three
quarters of an ounce; and that this ſkeleton
was bedded in a maſs of bitumen.</p>
                  <p>Hector Boethius, in his hiſtory of Scotland,
relates, that the bones of a man, ironically call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Little John,</hi> are ſtill preſerved, who was
ſuppoſed to have been 14 feet high.</p>
                  <p>In the Journal des Savans, <hi>anno</hi> 1692, there
is a letter from P. Gentil, profeſſor of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
at Angers, in which he ſays, that, having
been informed of a gigantic body diſcovered
nine leagues from the town of Laſſé, he went
to the ſpot to ſatisfy himſelf concerning the truth
of the fact. He learned from the curate of the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0195500109:347"/>
place, that, in digging his garden, a ſepulchre
was diſcovered which contained a body of 17
feet 2 inches long. There was no ſkin on the
body. This body had others between its arms
and legs, which might have been the perſon's
children. In the ſame place, there were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
fourteen or fifteen other ſepulchres, ſome
of them 10 feet, others 12, and others 14 feet
long, which contained bodies of the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions.
The ſepulchre of this giant continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
expoſed to the air more than a year; but, as
it attracted too many viſitors to the Curate, he
again covered it with earth, and planted three
trees in the place. Theſe ſepulchres were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
with a ſtone which reſembled chalk.</p>
                  <p>Thomas Molineux ſaw, in a cabinet at Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
a prodigious human frontal bone. From
its junction with the noſe to the ſagittal future, it
was 9 1/12 inches; its length was 12 2/10 inches, and
its thickneſs half an inch, <hi>i. e.</hi> in every dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

of M. Witreu at Amſterdam, a frontal bone,

in the ſame embarraſſment as myſelf, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the real exiſtence of giants of 24 feet
in length. I cannot perſuade myſelf, that at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time, or by any circumſtances whatever,
the human body could be elevated to ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
dimenſions. But, at the ſame time,
it is unqueſtionable, that giants of 10, 12, and
perhaps even of 15 feet high, have exiſted;
and it is almoſt certain, that, in the primaeval
ages of Nature, not only gigantic individuals,
but even permanent and ſucceſſive races of giants,
were produced, of which that of the Patagoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                  <p>M. Hoffman, when treating of ſlates, ſays,
that the petrified fiſhes found in theſe ſtones
have not only been living creatures, but that
the ſtrata of ſlate have originated from muddy
water, which, after fermenting and petrifying,
ſubſided in thin laminae or beds.</p>
                  <p>'In the ſlate of Angers,' ſays M. Guettard,
there are ſometimes impreſſions of plants and
fiſhes, which merit the greater attention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the impreſſions of the plants repreſent
marine <hi>fuci,</hi> or ſea-wreck, and thoſe of the
fiſhes repreſent different ſpecies of the cruſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
tribes, the impreſſions of which are
more rare than thoſe of ſcaly fiſhes, or ſhells.
He adds, that, after conſulting ſeveral authors
who treat of fiſhes and cruſtaceous animals,
he could not diſcover any of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled

The impreſſions of theſe fiſhes are generally
interſperſed with a whitiſh pyritous ſubſtance.
It is remarkable, that, in the ſlates of Angers,

               <div type="section">
                  <p>Many proofs might be given that all pit-coal
is compoſed of the ſpoils of vegetables, mixed
with bitumen and ſulphur, or rather with the
vitriolic acid, which is perceived when the coal
is burning. We often find a great quantity of
vegetables in the upper ſtrata of coal; and, in
proportion as we deſcend, we ſee traces of the
decompoſition of the ſame vegetables. There
are ſpecies of coal which are nót foſſil wood:
That found at Sainte-Agnés, near Lons-le-Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,
has a perfect reſemblance to logs or trunks
of fir, in which we diſtinctly perceive the marks
of each year's growth, as well as the pith.
Theſe trunks differ only from common fir by
being ſomewhat oval, and by their rings being
concentric ellipſes. They exceed not a foot in
circumference, and their bark is very thick and
full of furrows, like that of old firs. But the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0195500109:351"/>
bark of common firs, of the ſame ſize, is always
ſmooth.</p>
                  <p>'I found,' M. de Genſanne remarks, 'ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
veins of this kind of coal in the dioceſe
of Montpellier: Here the trunks are very
large; their texture reſembles that of cheſnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
from three to four feet in circumference.
Theſe foſſils, when burning, have only a ſlight
odour of aſphaltis. Their flame and embers
reſemble thoſe of wood. They are found
near the ſurface of the earth, and commonly
indicate the exiſtence of real pit-coal at great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
depths<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Nat. du Languedoc, par M. de Genſanne, tom. 1. p. 20.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>Theſe ligneous coals ought to be regarded as
wood depoſited in a bituminous earth, from
which they derive their foſſil quality. They
are found only in earths of this kind, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
near the ſurface. They ſometimes form
the ſtratum immediately above the ſeams of real
coal. Some of them, which have been impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with a ſmall quantity only of bitumen, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ſhades and colour of wood. 'I found
this ſpecies,' ſays M. de Genſanne, 'at Cazarets,
near Saint-Jean-de-Culcul, four leagues from
Montpellier. But, when broken, this foſſil
commonly preſents a ſmooth ſurface, perfectly
ſimilar to that of jet. In the ſame canton,
near Aſeras, there is foſſil wood changed into
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0195500109:352"/>
a white ferruginous pyrites. The mineral
matter occupies the heart of the wood; and
we diſtinctly perceive the woody ſubſtance
furrowed and partly diſſolved by the mineral
acid<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Nat. du Languedoc, tom. 1. p. 54.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>After ſuch proofs, related by M. de Genſanne
himſelf, who is otherwiſe a good mineralogiſt,
I acknowledge, that I was ſurpriſed to ſee him
aſcribe the origin of coal to clay more or leſs
impregnated with bitumen. This notion is not
only refuted by his own facts, but we ſhall be
convinced by thoſe I am about to relate, that we
ought to attribute the origin of every ſpecies of
coal to the ſpoils of vegetables mixed with bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>I agree with M. de Genſanne, that neither
this foſſil wood, nor turf, can be conſidered as
coal completely formed. That found near Lons
le-Saunier has been recently examined by the
Preſident de Ruffey, a learned Academician of
Dijon: He remarks, that this foſſil wood
makes a near approach to the nature of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal;
and that it is found within two or three
feet of the ſurface through an extent of two
leagues; that it is from three to four feet thick;
that we eaſily diſtinguiſh the ſpecies of wood
to be oaks, horn-beams, and trembling poplars;
that this wood is ſometimes in the form of bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
or faggots; that the bark of the logs is well
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0195500109:353"/>
preſerved; that the annual circles, the cuts
made by the axes, and, at different diſtances, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of chips, are plainly diſtinguiſhable;
that this wood converted into coal is excellent
for ſoldering iron; that, when burning, it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
a fetid odour; and that allum has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from it<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. de l'Acad. de Dijon, tom. 1. p. 47.</note>.</p>
                  <p>'Near the village called <hi>Beichlitz,</hi> about a
league from the town of Halle, two ſtrata,
compoſed of a bituminous earth and foſſil
wood, (of which there are ſeveral mines in the
country of Heſſe,) were diſcovered. It is ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to that found in the village of Sainte-Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nés
in Franche-comté, two leagues from
Lons-le-Saunier. This mine is in the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Saxe. The firſt ſtratum lies at the depth
of three fathoms and a half, and is from eight
to nine feet thick. To arrive at it, we cut
through a white ſand, then a whitiſh gray clay,
which is three feet thick: Still deeper, we
meet with a conſiderable thickneſs both of ſand
and clay, which cover the ſecond ſtratum.
This ſtratum is only from three and a half to
four feet thick. We ſounded deeper, but
found no other ſtrata of that kind.'</p>
                  <p>'Theſe ſtrata are horizontal; but they ſink
or riſe nearly in the ſame manner as common
ſtrata. They conſiſt of a brown bituminous
earth, which is friable when dry, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0195500109:354"/>
corrupted wood. Pieces of wood of all
ſizes are found, which, when taken from the
mine, where they are ſoft, muſt be cut with an
ax. This wood, when dry, breaks eaſily.
When broke, it ſhines like bitumen; but
we diſtinctly perceive in it the whole organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
of wood. It is leſs abundant than the
bituminous earth, and the workmen lay it
aſide for their own uſe.'</p>
                  <p>'A buſhel or two quintals of bituminous
earth ſells for eighteen or twenty French
ſous. In theſe ſtrata there are pyrites; they
are of a vitriolic nature; when expoſed to the
air they effloreſce and turn white: But the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous
matter is of little value, as it gives
but a feeble heat<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyages Metalurgiques de M. Jars, p. 320.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>Hence this ſpecies of foſſil wood, found ſo
near the ſurface of the earth, muſt be a much
more recent production than common pit-coal,
which is almoſt conſtantly ſunk very deep. But
this idea does not preclude the ancient coal from
being formed of the ſpoils of vegetables; ſince,
in the deepeſt coal-mines, we recogniſe woody
ſubſtances, and ſeveral characters which belong
to vegetables only. Beſides, there are ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of foſſil wood found in large maſſes, and
in extenſive beds, under ſtrata of free-ſtone and
calcarious rocks. Hence there is no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0195500109:355"/>
between real pit-coal and theſe charred
woods, but what ariſes from the degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſition,
and from a greater or ſmaller im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation with bitumen. The baſis of their
ſubſtance is the ſame, and both derive their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin
from the ſpoils of vegetables.</p>
                  <p>M. le Monnier, one of the King's phyſicians,

the ſurface of the earth on the weſt ſide;
and that, in every continent of the globe, the
declivity is more rapid on the weſt than on the
eaſt coaſts. This is evident in the continent
of America, the declivities of which are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rapid and abrupt toward the weſtern ſeas;
but, towards the eaſtern coaſts, the lands ſtretch
by a gentle declivity, and generally terminate in
large plains. In Europe, the line that forms
the ſummit of Great Britain, which runs from
north to ſouth, is much nearer the weſtern than
the eaſtern ocean: For the ſame reaſon, the
ſeas to the weſt of Britain and Ireland are much
deeper than the ſea which ſeparates Britain and
Holland. The ridge of Norway is much near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the ocean than the Baltic ſea. The mountains
which form the general ſummit of Europe are
much higher toward the weſt than the eaſt;
and, if we take a part of this ſummit, from
Switzerland to Siberia, it is much nearer the
Baltic and White Seas, than the Black Sea and
the Caſpian. The Alps and Apennines are
nearer the Mediterranean than the Adriatic ſea.
The chain of mountains which runs from Tirol

all Arabia, ſkirt the Mediterranean and the Red
Seas; and that, to the eaſt, there are vaſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
where the long courſed rivers run, and
at laſt empty themſelves in the Perſic Gulf.
The ſummit of the famous mountains of Gate
approaches nearer to the weſtern than the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
ſeas. The ridge which extends from the
weſt frontiers of China to the point of Mallacca,
is nearer the weſt than the eaſt ſea. In Africa,
the chain of Mount Atlas ſends rivers to the ſea
of the Canaries, whoſe courſes are much ſhorter
than thoſe which run into the interior parts of
the Continent, and, after traverſing vaſt tracts
of country, loſe themſelves in lakes or great

and ſtretch as far as the Cape of Good Hope,
occupy pretty uniformly the middle of Africa:
We will perceive, however, on examining the
ſea to the eaſt and weſt, that the ſea on the
eaſt is not deep, and is interſperſed with a great

nearer the weſt than the eaſt ſeas; that the plains
of theſe continents are always lengthened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

that the ſeas on the weſt coaſts are deeper, and

Count de Buffon, I can give a ſtriking exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
The Maillés, a ſmall ſavage nation in
Guiana, near the mouth of the river Ouaſſa,
have no other habitation than trees, upon which
they dwell during the whole year, becauſe their
country is always more or leſs covered with
water. They never deſcend from theſe trees,
except when they go in canoes in queſt of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.
This is a ſingular example of a ſtupid
attachment to a native country; for theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,
in order to procure habitations on land,
have only to remove a few leagues from thoſe
drowned ſavannahs which gave them birth, and

in the ſouth is that of the loſs of Taprobana,

ſeem to indicate the ſummits of countries that

                  <p>It likewiſe appears, that the iſlands of Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar

and revolutions in the ſouthern ſeas have been
produced by the ſinking of caverns, by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
and by exploſions of ſubterraneous fires.
But lands have alſo been carried off by the ſlow

                  <p>In Guiana, our author remarks, the rivers
are ſo near each other, and at the ſame time ſo
ſwelled and rapid during the rainy ſeaſon, that
they carry down immenſe quantities of mud,
and depoſit them on all the low grounds and on
the bottom of the ſea. The coaſts of French
Guiana are ſo low, that they may rather be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as beaches totally covered with mud, and
having an almoſt imperceptible declivity. This
mud extends to a great diſtance at the bottom
of the ſea. Large veſſels cannot approach the
river Cayenne without ſtriking; and ſhips of
war are obliged to remain two or three leagues
from the land. This mud extends along the
whole margin of the ſea from Cayenne to the
river of the Amazones. In this great extent of
mud there is no ſand, and berry-bearing alders
are frequent all along the coaſt. But, ſeven or
eight leagues above Cayenne, weſtward as far
as the river Marony, we find ſome creeks, the
bottoms of which conſiſt of ſand and rocks,
which give riſe to breakers. The mud, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
covers the greater part of theſe rocks, as
well as the beds of ſand; and it is thicker in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as it recedes from the margin of the ſea.
Theſe ſmall rocks prevent not the ground from
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0195500109:363"/>
having a very gentle deſcent for ſeveral leagues
on land. This part of Guiana, which, to the
north-weſt of Cayenne, is more elevated than
the lands to the ſouth-eaſt. Of this fact we
have good evidence; for all along the borders
of the ſea, we find large drowned ſavannahs,
moſt of which are dry in the north-weſt, whilſt
they are totally covered with ſea-water in the
ſouth-eaſt parts. Beſide theſe lands actually
drowned by the ſea, there are others more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
which have likewiſe been formerly drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In ſome places we alſo find ſavannahs of
freſh water; but they produce no alders, but
many palm-trees. On all theſe low coaſts, not
a ſtone is to be ſeen. The tide riſes ſeven or
eight feet, though it is oppoſed by the currents;
for they are all directed toward the Antilles.
When the waters of the rivers are low, the tide
is very perceptible, as high up the rivers as forty
and even fifty leagues. But, during the rainy
ſeaſon, when the rivers are ſwelled, the tide is
ſcarcely perceptible at the diſtance of a league
or two, ſo great is the rapidity of the waters;
and their impetuoſity is greateſt during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux.</p>
                  <p>Upon the ſandy bottoms of theſe creeks, the
ſea-turtles depoſit their eggs; and they never
frequent the muddy places; ſo that, from Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne
to the river of the Amazones, there are no
turtles; and the people go to fiſh them from
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0195500109:364"/>
the river Courou to the Marony. The mud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to gain ground daily on the ſand; and,
in the progreſs of time, the north-weſt coaſt of
Cayenne will be covered with it as well as
the ſouth-eaſt; for the turtles, who will depoſit
their eggs in ſand only, gradually retire from
the river Courou; and, for ſome years paſt, the
fiſhers are obliged to ſearch for them near the
river Marony, the ſands of which are not yet
covered.</p>
                  <p>Beyond the ſavannahs, ſome of which are
dry and others drowned, there is a chain of hills
that are all covered with a great depth of earth,
and every where planted with foreſts. Theſe
hills are generally from 350 to 400 feet high.
But, about ten or twelve leagues farther up the
country, they are perhaps double this height.
Moſt of theſe mountains are evidently extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
volcano's. At the top of one of them,
called <hi>la Gabrielle,</hi> there is a ſmall lake, in which
are a number of alligators, whoſe ſpecies ſeems
to have been preſerved from the time that the
ſea covered this hill.</p>
                  <p>Beyond Mount Gabrielle, we find only ſmall
valleys, little hills, and volcanic matters, not in
large maſſes, but in ſmall blocks. The moſt
common ſtone, blocks of which are carried down
by the waters as far as Cayenne, is that called
<hi>beetle-ſtone.</hi> It is not a ſtone, but the lava of
a volcano. It has received the name of <hi>beetle-ſtone,</hi>

                  <p>In the higheſt regions of the Alps, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which proceed from the annual meltings of
the ſnow, freeze in every direction, and on all the
points of the mountains from their baſes to their
ſummits, and eſpecially in the valleys, and on
the declivities of thoſe that are collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in groups: In this manner, the waters
have formed in theſe valleys ſome mountains
which have rocks for their nucleus, and others
that conſiſt entirely of ice: Theſe mountains
are ſix, ſeven, and even eight leagues long by
one in breadth, and often from a thouſand, to
twelve hundred fathoms high. Theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
maſſes of ice are continually extending
farther along the valleys; for though, in warm
and rainy ſeaſons, their progreſs is not only
ſtopped, but their ſize diminiſhed, the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the glaciers is perpetually augmenting.</p>
                  <p>Under the equator, the point of congelation,
in detached mountains, is fixed at the height of
2440 fathoms. But this is no rule for groups
of mountains which are frozen from their ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0195500109:366"/>
the point of congelation in detached mountains
is aſcertained to be at the height of 1500 fathoms,
and all below this point thaws completely. But
thoſe which are grouped together freeze at a
ſmaller height, and thaw from their top to their
baſe; which ſhows how much the degree of
cold is augmented by immenſe maſſes of congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
matter confined within a narrow compaſs.</p>
                  <p>The whole frozen mountains of Switzerland,
when taken together, occupy an extent of 66
leagues from eaſt to weſt, meaſured in a ſtraight
line from the weſtern borders of the canton of
Vallis towards Savoy, to the eaſtern borders of
the canton of Bendner towards Tirol. They
form an interrupted chain, ſeveral arms of which
extend, from north to ſouth, about 36 leagues.
The great Gothard, the Fourk, and the Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
are the higheſt mountains in this quarter:
They occupy the center of thoſe chains which
divide Switzerland into two parts. They are
perpetually covered with ſnow and ice; from

                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0195500109:367"/>
The valleys of ice are thoſe depreſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the mountains which are much more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated
than the inhabited valleys. They are
always filled with ſnow, which accumulates,
and forms maſſes of ice ſeveral leagues in length.
Theſe maſſes join the high mountains.</p>
                  <p>The fields of ice, or frozen ſeas, which lie
along the mountains, have a gentle declivity.
They cannot be called valleys, becauſe they are
not ſufficiently depreſſed. They are covered
with a great thickneſs of ſnow. Theſe fields
receive water from the melting of the ſnow,
which deſcends from the mountains, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
freeze. The ſurface of theſe fields alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
melts and freezes; and the whole are
covered with thick beds of ſnow and ice.</p>
                  <p>The gletchers are heaps of ſlakes or plates of
ice formed by the ſnows, and precipitated from
the mountains. Theſe ſnows freeze again, and
are interwoven in various manners: This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
has given riſe to the diviſion of glet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
into mounts, mantlings, and walls of ice.</p>
                  <p>The mounts of ice riſe between the ſummits
of the high mountains: They themſelves form
mountains; but they contain no rocks. They
are compoſed entirely of ice, and are ſometimes
ſeveral leagues in length, one league broad, and
half a league thick.</p>
                  <p>The mantlings are formed in the ſuperior
valleys, and upon the ſides of the mountains,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0195500109:368"/>
which are covered with ice, having folds reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
drapery: They ſend their ſuperfluous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into the lower valleys.</p>
                  <p>The walls of ice are rugged mantlings which
terminate the flat valleys, and appear, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
like troubled ſeas, whoſe waves have
been ſuddenly arreſted and frozen. Theſe walls
conſiſt not of irregular points: They often form
columns, pyramids, and enormous towers compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of ſeveral ſides. Theſe towers are ſometimes
hexagonal, and of a blue or greeniſh colour.</p>
                  <p>On the ſides, and at the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
maſſes of ſnow are formed, which are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
moiſtened with the water from the
melted ſnows, and then covered with freſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulations.
We likewiſe ſee plates of ice col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in heaps, which belong neither to the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
valleys nor the mountains of ice. Their
poſition is either horizontal or inclined. Theſe
detached heaps are called <hi>beds</hi> or <hi>ſtrata</hi> of ice.</p>
                  <p>Several of theſe mountains of ice are undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the interior heat of the earth, which
gives riſe to currents of water that melts their
inferior ſurfaces. They then, by their own
weight, ſink inſenſibly, and their height is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
by the waters, ſnow, and ice, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſucceſſively cover them. Theſe ſinkings
often produce horrible craſhings. The crevices
which open in the ice form precipices which are
both numerous and full of danger. Theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſes
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0195500109:369"/>
are the more treacherous and baneful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are generally covered with ſnow.
Travellers, and hunters who chaſe the fallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer,
the chamois goat, &amp;c. or thoſe who ſearch
for cryſtals, are often ſwallowed up by theſe
gulfs, and again thrown upon the ſurface by
the waters which run at their bottoms.</p>
                  <p>Gentle rain quickly diſſolves ſnows: But all
the water which proceeds from them falls not
into theſe gulfs. A great part of it freezes on
the ſurface of the ice and augments its volume.</p>
                  <p>The warm ſouth winds, which generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in the month of May, are the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
agents in deſtroying the ſnows and ice.
Their melting is announced by the craſhing of the
frozen lakes, and the dreadful noiſe produced
by the ſhock of ſtones and ice, which in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
confuſion roll down from the tops of the
mountains, and by torrents of water that fall
from the rocks of more than 1200 feet high.</p>
                  <p>The heat of the ſun has little effect upon the
ſnow and ice. Experience has proved, that ice
which has exiſted a long time under an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
weight, and in accumulated degrees of
cold, is ſo denſe and ſo completely deprived of
air, that, when ſmall pieces of it are expoſed to
the greateſt heat of the ſun, during a whole
day, they ſcarcely melt.</p>
                  <p>Though the glaciers melt partially every ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
though the winds and the heat of certain
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0195500109:370"/>
years deſtroy the accumulation of ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
years; yet it is certain, that theſe <hi>gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers
conſtantly augment in all their dimenſions.</hi>
This fact is aſcertained by the annals of the
country, by authentic deeds, and by invariable
tradition. Independent of theſe authorities, and
of daily obſervation, the progreſſive increaſe
of the glaciers is proved by <hi>foreſts of trees
which have been abſorbed by the ice, ſome of
whoſe tops ſtill appear above the ſurface of the
glaciers</hi>: Theſe, as well as <hi>the tops of ſteeples
belonging to a village</hi> that had been buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſnows, and which are ſtill viſible after
uncommon meltings, are irrefragable evidences
of the gradual progreſs of the glaciers. This
progreſſion can proceed from no other cauſe
than an augmentation in the degree of cold,
which increaſes in proportion to the maſſes of
accumulated ice. It is likewiſe certain, that, in
the glaciers of Switzerland, the cold is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
more intenſe, though it continues ſhorter,
than in Iceland, the glaciers of which, as
well as thoſe of Norway, have a great relation to
thoſe of Switzerland.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the frozen mountains of
Switzerland is ſimilar to that of all other high
mountains. The nucleus is a vitreous rock
which reaches to their ſummit. The parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
which had been covered with the ocean,
are compoſed of calcarious ſtone, as well as the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0195500109:371"/>
whole ſubſtance of the mountains of an inferior
order, which are diſpoſed in groups at the foot
of the primitive glacier mountains. Laſtly, theſe
calcarious maſſes have ſlate, produced by the
ſediments of the waters, for their baſis.</p>
                  <p>The vitreous maſſes are pure rock, granite,
and quartz. Their fiſſures are filled with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
ſemi-metals, mineral ſubſtances, and cryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
                  <p>The calcarious maſſes are lime-ſtone, marbles
of every ſpecies, chalk, gypſum, ſpar, alabaſter,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The ſlaty maſſes conſiſt of ſlates of various
qualities and colours, which contain plants and
fiſhes, and are often ſituated at conſiderable
heights. Their ſtrata are not always horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
They are often inclined, ſometimes ſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and in particular places perpendicular.</p>
                  <p>We cannot entertain a doubt concerning the
ancient abode of the ſea upon the glacier moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.

mountains, fully aſcertain this point. Theſe
ſhells are either diſtributed in tribes, or different
ſpecies are blended together, and they are found
at very great heights.</p>
                  <p>It is probable, that, at a very remote period,
the glaciers had not been formed on theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
not even when the ocean abandoned
them; though it appears by their great diſtance
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0195500109:372"/>
from the ſea, which is near a hundred leagues,
and by their exceſſive height, that they were the
firſt that aroſe above the water in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
of Europe. They have likewiſe had their
volcano's. Mount Myſſenberg, in the canton
of Schwitz, ſeems to have been the laſt volcano
that was extinguiſhed. The two principal ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
which are very high and detached, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in cones, like all the mouths of volcano's;
and we ſtill ſee the crater of one of theſe cones,
which is very deep.</p>
                  <p>M. Bourrit, who had the courage to make a
number of expeditions in the glaciers of Savoy,
remarks, 'That the increaſe of all the glaciers in
the Alps is unqueſtionable; that the quantity

that which melts in the ſummers; that the

                  <p>The ſame indefatigable obſerver, when treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>glatchers</hi> or glaciers with prominent

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0195500109:373"/>
that the growth of the ice is evident, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this place, but in ſeveral others; that the
inhabitants remembered a former communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
between Chamounis and Val-d'Aoſt,
which is now totally ſhut up by the ice; that
the ice, in general, muſt have firſt accumulated
by ſtretching from ſummit to ſummit, and then
from one valley to another; and that, in this
manner, a communication has been formed

                  <head>Of the North-Eaſt paſſage.</head>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding what has been advanced by
the Ruſſians, it is extremely doubtful that they
ever doubled the northern point of Aſia. M.
Engel, who regards the north-weſt paſſage by
Hudſon's and Baffin's bay, as impoſſible, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
on the contrary, to be perſuaded, that a
ſhorter and more certain paſſage will be found
by the north-eaſt. To the feeble reaſons he
gives in ſupport of this opinion, he adds a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
of M. Gmelin, who, when ſpeaking of
the experiments made by the Ruſſians, in order
to diſcover this north-eaſt paſſage, ſays, 'that
the manner in which they proceeded in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
theſe diſcoveries will aſtoniſh the whole
world, after an authentic relation of them
ſhall be made public, which depends ſolely
on the pleaſure of the Empreſs.'—'There
can be nothing aſtoniſhing,' ſays M. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
'in this ſubject, except it be to learn that
a paſſage, which was formerly regarded as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
is now found to be extremely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.
This is the only fact,' he adds, 'which
can ſurpriſe thoſe whom the Ruſſians have
endeavoured to terrify by relations publiſhed

I ſhall, in the firſt place, remark, that we
ought to be well aſcertained with regard to
facts, before we throw an imputation of this
kind upon the Ruſſian empire. In the ſecond
place, the remark ſeems to be ill founded; for
the words employed by M. Gmelin may admit
of an oppoſite interpretation from that given of
them by M. Engel, namely, That we will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed
when we ſhall learn that no practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
paſſage exiſts by the north-eaſt. Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the general reaſons I have given, I am
confirmed in this opinion by the following cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance:
The Ruſſians themſelves, in their
late experiments, uniformly aſcend by Kampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatka,
and never deſcend by the point of Aſia.
Captains Bering and Tſchirikow, in the year
1741, reconnoitered the coaſt of America as far
as the 59th degree; but neither of them ſailed
northward along the coaſts of Aſia. This fact
is a ſufficient proof, that the paſſage is not ſo
practicable as M. Engel ſuppoſes; or rather,
that the Ruſſians are ſatisfied that it is not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable;
for, if otherwiſe, their navigators would
have been ſent by this route, inſtead of making
them take their departure from Kamptſchatka,
in order to diſcover the weſt of America.</p>
                  <p>M. Muller, who was ſent by the Empreſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with M. Gmelin, to Siberia, is of a very
different opinion from M. Engel. After compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the relations on this ſubject, M. Muller
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0195500109:376"/>
concludes by remarking, that there is only a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſmall ſeparation between Aſia and America;
and that this ſtrait contains ſeveral iſlands,
which ſerve as common ſtations to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
of both continents. This opinion, I believe,
is well founded; and, in ſupport of it, M.
Muller has collected a great number of facts.
In the ſubterraneous abodes of the inhabitants
of the iſland of Karaga, we ſee beams made of
large pines, which neither this iſland, nor the
adjacent countries of Kamtſchatka, produce.
The inhabitants ſay, that this wood is driven
upon their coaſts by the eaſt wind. On the
coaſts of Kamtſchatka, boards of ice are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for ſeveral days together, during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
At certain ſeaſons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lights of birds arrive,
and, after ſtaying ſome months, return to the
eaſt, from whence they came. Hence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
oppoſite to that of Aſia, toward the
north, deſcends as far as Kamtſchatka. This
continent muſt be the weſt of America. M.
Muller<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 18. p. 484.</note>, after giving an abridgement of five or
ſix voyages attempted by the north ſea, with a
view to double the north point of Aſia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that every circumſtance announces the
impoſſibility of this navigation, which he
proves by the following arguments. This na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
muſt be performed in ſummer: The
diſtance from Archangel to the Oby, and from
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0195500109:377"/>
this river to Jeniſey, requires a whole ſeaſon.
The paſſage by Waygait has coſt infinite labour
to the Britiſh and Dutch. In going through
this icy ſtrait, we meet with iſlands which block
up the road; and the continent, which forms
a cape between the rivers Piaſida and Chatanga,
and advances beyond the 76th degree of latitude,
is likewiſe bordered with a chain of iſlands,
which ſcarcely leave a paſſage for navigation.
If we want to remove from the coaſts, and
to reach the open ſea toward the Pole, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
immoveable mountains of ice found at
Greenland and Spitzbergen, ſeem to indicate a
continuity of ice as far as the Pole. If we want
to go along the coaſts, <hi>this navigation is more
difficult now than it was a hundred years ago.</hi>
There the waters of the ocean are ſenſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed:
We ſtill ſee, at a diſtance from the
ſhoals along the Frozen Sea, wood that had been
thrown upon the lands which formerly bounded
the ocean. Theſe ſhoals have ſo little depth,
that very flat boats can alone be uſed in them:
ſuch boats are too weak to reſiſt the ice; neither
can they contain proviſions ſufficient for a long
navigation. Though the Ruſſians have reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for ſailing theſe cold ſeas ſuperior to thoſe of
moſt other European nations, yet in none of the
voyages attempted upon the Frozen Sea has a
paſſage been diſcovered between Europe or Aſia
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o America. It is only by departing from
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0195500109:378"/>
Kamtſchatka, or ſome other more eaſterly point
of Aſia, that the weſterly coaſts of America have
ever been diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Captain Bering took his departure from port
Awatſcha in Kamtſchatka, on the 4th day of
June 1741. After ſailing ſouth-eaſt, and then
north-eaſt, he diſcovered, on the 18th of July,
the continent of America in latitude 58° 28′.
Two days after, he anchored near an iſland in
the mouth of a bay, from whence he diſcovered
two capes, the one to the eaſt he called Saint-Elie,
and the other to the weſt Saint-Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene.
He then diſpatched Chitrou, one of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
to reconnoitre the gulf which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
They found that it was interſperſed with
iſlands, on one of which they ſaw deſerted cabins
made of planks well joined, and even chamfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They conjectured that this iſland might
have been inhabited by ſome people from the
continent of America. M. Steller, who was
ſent to make obſervations on theſe new diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lands, found a cave, in which were a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of ſmoked ſalmon, ropes, furniture, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
utenſils. Advancing ſtill farther, he ſaw
the Americans flying from him. He next per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a fire on a diſtant hill. The ſavages had
unqueſtionably retired thither: A rugged and
ſteep rock covered their retreat<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 19. p. 371.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0195500109:379"/>
After relating theſe facts, it is eaſy to perceive,
that it is only by taking their departure from
Kamtſchatka that the Ruſſians can carry on
commerce with China and Japan, and that it is
equally difficult, if not impoſſible, for the other
nations of Europe to paſs by the north-eaſt ſeas,
the greater part of which are entirely frozen.
Hence I cannot heſitate in repeating, that the
only poſſible paſſage is by the north-weſt, at
the bottom of Hudſon's bay, and that this is
the place where all future attempts to diſcover
this uſeful paſſage ought to be made.</p>
                  <p>After the preceding ſheets had been printed,
I received from M. le Comte Schouvaloff, that
great ſtateſman whom all Europe eſteems and
reſpects, an excellent memoir compoſed by M.
de Domaſcheneff, preſident of the Imperial So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Peterſourg, and to whom the Empreſs
has aſſigned the department of every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to arts and ſciences. This illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
has likewiſe ſent me a copy of the chart
drawn by the pilot Otcheredin, in which are
repreſented the tracks and diſcoveries he made
in the years 1770 and 1773, between Kamt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatka
and the continent of America. M. de
Domaſcheneff, in his memoir, remarks, that
this chart of the pilot Otcheredin is moſt exact,
and that the one publiſhed in the year 1773 by
the Academy of Peterſburg, requires ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments,
eſpecially with regard to the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0195500109:380"/>
of the iſlands and the pretended Archipelago,
which are repreſented between the Aleutes or
Aleoutes iſlands, and thoſe of Anadir, otherwiſe
called Andrien. The chart of Otcheredin ſeems
to ſhow, that theſe two groups of iſlands, the
Aleutes and the iſlands of Andrien, are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an open ſea of more than a hundred
leagues broad. M. de Domaſcheneff aſſures us,
that the great general chart of the Ruſſian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
publiſhed in the year 1777, gives an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
repreſentation of all the coaſts on the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
extremity of Aſia inhabited by the Tſchut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis:
He ſays, that this chart was executed from
the moſt recent diſcoveries made in the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
of Major Pawluzki againſt that people.
'This coaſt,' ſays M. de Domaſcheneff, 'bounds
the great chain of mountains which ſeparate
Siberia from the ſouth of Aſia, and terminates
by dividing itſelf between the chain that ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
through Kamtſchatka, and thoſe which
occupy the territories between the rivers that
run to the eaſt of the Lena. The known
iſlands between the coaſts of Kamtſchatka and
thoſe of America are mountainous, as well as
the coaſts of Kamtſchatka and thoſe of the
continent of America. Hence there is a diſtinct
continuation between the chains of mountains
belonging to both continents, the intervals of
which, perhaps leſs conſiderable formerly, may
have been enlarged by the decaying of rocks,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0195500109:381"/>
by the perpetual currents which run from the
Frozen Sea toward the ſouthern ocean, and by
the revolutions which the earth has undergone.'</p>
                  <p>But this ſub-marine chain which joins the lands
of Kamtſchatka to thoſe of America is more
ſoutherly, by ſeven or eight degrees, than that
of the iſlands of Anadir or Andrien, which,
from time immemorial, have ſerved the Tſchutſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis
as a paſſage to America.</p>
                  <p>According to M. de Domaſcheneff, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that this voyage from the point of Aſia to
the continent of America, is performed by oars,
and that theſe people go there to diſpoſe of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
iron-works to the Americans; that the
iſlands in this paſſage are ſo frequent, that the
ſailors may ſleep every night on land; and that
the continent of America, with which the
Tſchutſchis traffick, is mountainous, and covered
with foreſts, which are full of foxes, martins,
and ſables, the qualities and colours of whoſe
furs are totally different from thoſe of Siberia.
Theſe northern iſlands, ſituated between the
two continents, are known to the Tſchutſchis
only. They form a chain between the moſt eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
point of Aſia and the continent of America,
under the 64th degree of latitude; and this chain
is divided by an open ſea, from the other more
ſouthern chain formerly mentioned, which lies
between Kamtſchatka and America, and is under
the 56th degree. The iſlands of this ſecond chain
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0195500109:382"/>
the Ruſſians and inhabitants of Kamtſchat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka
frequent in queſt of ſea-otters, and black
foxes, whoſe furs are very precious. Before
the year 1750, even the moſt eaſtern of the
iſlands which compoſe this chain were known.
One of theſe iſlands bears the name of Captain
Bering, and another, adjacent to the former, is
called the iſland of Medenoi. We next meet
with the iſlands of Aleutes or Aleoutes. The
two firſt are ſituated a little above, and the laſt a
little below the 55th degree of latitude. About
the 56th degree, we find the iſlands of Atkhou
and Amlaïgh, which are the firſt of the chain
called the Iſlands of Foxes: They extend as far
to the north-eaſt as the 61ſt degree of latitude.
Theſe iſlands have received their denomination
from the prodigious number of foxes found in
them. The two iſlands of Captain Bering and
Medenoi were uninhabited when firſt diſcovered.
But, in the iſlands of Aleutes, though advanced
farther to the eaſt, more than ſixty families were
found, whoſe language had no relation either
to that of Kamtſchatka or to any of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
languages of Aſia: It is a dialogue of the
language ſpoken in the other iſlands adjacent to
America, which ſeems to indicate that they have
been peopled by the Americans, and not by the
Aſiatics.</p>
                  <p>The iſlands called by Captain Bering's crew
Saint-Julian, Saint-Theodor, and Saint-Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0195500109:383"/>
are the ſame with thoſe which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the name of Aleutes. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the iſlands of Chommaghin and Saint-Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat,
diſcovered by this navigator, form a part
of thoſe now called the Iſlands of Foxes.</p>
                  <p>'The great diſtance,' ſays M. de Domaſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neff,
'and the open and deep ſea between the
iſlands of Aleutes and thoſe of Foxes, joined
to the different direction of the latter, render
it probable, that theſe iſlands never formed one
continued chain, but that the former, with
thoſe of Medenoi and Bering, make a chain
which comes from Kamtſchatka; that the
Iſlands of Foxes exhibit another paſſage to
America; and that both of theſe chains generally
loſs themſelves in the depth of the ocean, and
are promontories to the two continents. The
courſe of the Iſlands of Foxes, ſome of which
are of great extent, is intermixed with rocks
and breakers, and continues without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as far as the continent of America. But
theſe moſt adjacent to this continent are very
little frequented by the Ruſſian hunters; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are very populous, and it would be
dangerous to ſojourn in them. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
iſlands in the neighbourhood of America
which are ſtill little known. Some ſhips, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
have penetrated as far as the iſland of
Kadjack, which is very near the continent
of America. We are aſſured of this fact by the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0195500109:384"/>
relation of the iſlanders; and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
confirm the truth of their aſſertion: All
the iſlands that lie more to the weſt, produce
only dwarfiſh and miſ-ſhapen ſhrubs, which
the winds from the open ſea prevent from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
higher. The iſland of Kadjack, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and the ſmall adjacent iſlands, produce
groves of alder-trees, which ſeem to indicate
that they are leſs expoſed, and that they are
ſheltered on the north and eaſt by a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
continent. Beſides, in Kadjack, we
find freſh water otters, which appear not
in the other iſlands; and we likewiſe find a
ſmall ſpecies of marmot, which ſeems to be the
marmot of Canada. Laſtly, we diſcover, in
that iſland, traces of the bear and wolf; and
the inhabitans clothe themſelves with rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers
ſkins brought to them from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of America, to which they lie very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous.'</p>
                  <p>'From a voyage to the iſland of Kadjack, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by one Geottof, we learn, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
of America is called <hi>Atakthan</hi> by the
iſlanders: They ſay, that this great land is
mountainous and covered with foreſts; that
it is ſituated to the north of their iſland; and
that the mouth of a great river there goes by
the name of <hi>Alaghſchak.</hi> Beſides, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable,
that Bering, as well as Tſchiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kow,
actually reached this great continent;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0195500109:385"/>
for, at Cape Elie, where Bering moored his
frigate, they ſaw the coaſt riſe into a chain
of mountains which were covered with thick
foreſts. The ſoil was of a nature totally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that of Kamtſchatka; and Steller
collected a number of American plants.'</p>
                  <p>M. de Domaſcheneff farther obſerves, that all the
Iſlands of Foxes, as well as thoſe of Aleutes
and Bering, are mountainous; that their coaſts
are rocky, often terminate in precipices, and
are ſurrounded to a conſiderable diſtance with
rocks; that the country riſes, from the coaſts
to the middle of theſe iſlands, into rugged
mountains, which form ſmall chains through
the whole length of each iſland. Beſides, there
have been, and ſtill are, volcano's in ſeveral of
theſe iſlands; and in thoſe where the volcano's
are extinguiſhed, there are fountains of hot
water. In the iſlands with the volcano's, no
metals are found, but only calcedons and
ſome other coloured ſtones of no value. In theſe
iſlands, the inhabitants have no other wood but
what is floated into them by the ſea, and the
quantity is not great. More wood arrives in
the iſland of Bering and the Aleutes. This
floated wood ſeems to come from the ſouth;
for the camphor tree of Japan has been found
on the coaſts of theſe iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants are pretty numerous; but, as
they lead a wandering life, and tranſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0195500109:386"/>
from one iſland to another, it is not
poſſible to aſcertain their number. It has been
remarked, in general, that the larger the iſlands
are, they are the nearer America, and the more
populous. It likewiſe appears, that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Iſlands of Foxes are of the ſame
nation, to which thoſe of the Aleutes and the
iſlands of Andrien may alſo be referred, though
they differ in ſome cuſtoms. All theſe people,
in their manners, modes of living, and of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
have a great reſemblance to the Eſquimaux
and the Greenlanders. <hi>Kanaghiſt,</hi> the name of
theſe iſlanders in their own language, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
corrupted by the mariners, has ſtill a
great affinity to <hi>Karalit,</hi> the denomination of
the Eſquimaux and their brethren the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.
Among the inhabitants of all the iſlands
between Aſia and America, no other utenſils
were found but ſtone-hatchets, flint-knives, and
the ſhoulder bones of animals ſharpened to cut
herbage. They have likewiſe darts armed
with ſharp flints, and moſt artfully cut. They
have now a great many implements of iron,
which they have obtained from the Ruſſians.
They make canoes like the Eſquimaux; ſome
of them are ſo large that they contain twenty
perſons. They are made of light wood, and are
entirely covered with the ſkins of ſeals and
other ſea-animals.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe facts, it appears, that, from
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0195500109:387"/>
time immemorial, the Tſchutſchis, who inhabit
the eaſtern point of Aſia between the 55th and
70th degree of latitude, have had commerce
with the Americans; that this intercourſe was
the more eaſy to a people accuſtomed to all the
rigours of cold; and that the voyage, which
perhaps exceeds not a hundred leagues, might
be performed in ſimple canoes, conducted by
oars in ſummer, and probably on the ice in
winter, by landing daily upon a different iſland.
America, therefore, might be peopled by Aſia
under this parallel; and every circumſtance
ſeems to indicate, that, though there are now
intervals of ſea between theſe iſlands, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
conſtituted but one continent, by which
America was joined to Aſia. It is likewiſe
probable, that, beyond the iſlands of Anadir or
Andrien, <hi>i. e.</hi> between the 70th and 75th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of latitude, the two continents are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united, though that track of land is perhaps
entirely covered with ſnow and ice. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the regions beyond the 70th degree is an
enterpriſe worthy of the great Sovereign of the
Ruſſias, and it ought to be entruſted to a navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator
equally intrepid as Captain Phipps. I am
perſuaded, that they would find the two conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
united; but, if otherwiſe, and if there
is an open ſea beyond the iſlands of Andrien,
it appears to be certain, that they would find the
projections of the great Polar glacier at the 81ſt
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0195500109:388"/>
or 8d degree, as Captain Phipps diſcovered them
at the ſame latitude between Spitzbergen and
Greenland.</p>

                  <head>Concerning that period when the powers of Man
aided thoſe of Nature.</head>
                  <p>The firſt men were witneſſes of the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
motions of the earth, which were then fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and terrible. For a refuge againſt inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
they had nothing but the mountains,
which they were often forced to abandon by the
fire of volcano's. They trembled on ground
which trembled under their feet. Naked in
mind as well as in body, expoſed to the injuries
of every element, victims to the rapacity of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious
animals, which they were unable to
combat, penetrated with the common ſentiment
of terror, and preſſed by neceſſity, they muſt
have quickly aſſociated, at firſt to protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by their numbers, and then to afford mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
aid to each other in forming habitations
and weapons of defence. They began with ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
into the figure of axes thoſe hard flints,
thoſe <hi>thunder-ſtones,</hi> which their deſcendants i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
to have been produced by thunder, and
to have fallen from the clouds, but which, in
reality, are the firſt monuments of human art.
They would ſoon extract fire from theſe flints
by ſtriking them againſt each other.</p>

                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:0195500109:389"/>
To deſtroy the bruſhwood and the foreſts,
they would employ the flames derived from vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's,
or from their burning lavas; for, with
the aſſiſtance of this powerful element, they
cleared and purified the grounds which they
choſe to inhabit. With the axes of ſtone, they
cut trees, and fabricated thoſe weapons and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils
of which neceſſity firſt ſuggeſted the uſe;
and, after being provided with clu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s and other
heavy armour, would not theſe firſt men diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the means of making lighter weapons to
annoy at a diſtance? The tendon of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
the fibres of aloes, or the pliant bark
of ſome ligneous plant, would ſerve them for
a cord to unite the extremities of an elaſtic
branch; with which they made their bow:
To arm their arrows, they employed ſmall
ſharp flints. In a ſhort time they would have
thread, rafts, and canoes; and in this ſtate
they would remain till little nations were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Theſe nations were compoſed of a few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
or rather of the deſcendants of the ſame
family, which is ſtill the condition of thoſe ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
who live independent in ſuch open and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
territories as afford them game, fiſhes,
and fruits. But, in territories which are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
by waters, or confined by high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
theſe ſmall nations, after a great increaſe
of population, were obliged to divide the land
among themſelves; and, from this moment,
the earth became the inheritance of man. He
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0195500109:390"/>
took poſſeſſion of it by his labour and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the attachment to a native ſoil follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rapidly the firſt acts of property. As indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
intereſt conſtitutes a part of national or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
government and laws muſt have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſociety muſt have aſſumed ſtrength and
conſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, theſe men, deeply affected with
the miſeries of their original ſtate, and having
ſtill before their eyes the ravages of inundations,
the conflagrations of volcano's, and gulfs open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſuccuſſions of the earth, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a durable, and almoſt eternal, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the calamities the world has ſuffered.
The idea, that it muſt periſh by an univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
or by a general conflagration; the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for certain mountains upon which they
had been ſaved from inundations; their horror
at others which threw out fires more dreadful
than thoſe of thunder; the view of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
between the earth and heavens, which gave
riſe to the fable of the Titans, and of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
againſt the Gods; the notion of the real
exiſtence of a malevolent being, with the terror
and ſuperſtition which it unavoidably produced;
all theſe ſentiments, founded upon fear, took
an unconquerable poſſeſſion of the human mind.
Even at preſent, men are not entirely emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
from theſe ſuperſtitious terrors by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of time, by the tranquillity which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0195500109:391"/>
thoſe ages of convulſions and ſtorms,
nor by the knowledge of the effects and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Nature, a knowledge which could not
be acquired till after the eſtabliſhment of ſome
great ſociety in a tranquil land.</p>
                  <p>It is neither in Africa, nor in the moſt ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
regions of Aſia, that great ſocieties or nations
could be firſt formed. Theſe countries were
ſtill burning and deſert. Neither could this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
happen in America, which, except its
chain of mountains, is evidently a new country;
nor even in Europe, which very lately derived
its learning from the Eaſt, where the firſt civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
men were eſtabliſhed; for, before the
foundation of Rome, the happieſt countries in this
part of the world, ſuch as Italy, France, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
were then peopled with men more than half
ſavage. Tacitus, in his Manners of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
exhibits a picture of thoſe of the Hurons,
or rather of men juſt emerging from a ſtate of
nature. Hence the ſource of human knowledge
muſt have ariſen in the northern countries of
Aſia; and power is a neceſſary reſult of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
The more man knows, the more he can
perform; and the leſs he has done, the leſs he
knows. All this implies an active people in a
happy climate, living under a pure ſky and in
a fertile country, remote from inundations and
volcano's: It muſt alſo have been a high coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and, of courſe, more anciently temperate
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0195500109:392"/>
than the more ſouthern regions. Now, all theſe
conditions, all theſe circumſtances, are united in
the centre of Aſia, from the 40th to the 55th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of latitude. The rivers which run into the
North Sea, into the Eaſtern Ocean, and into the
South and Caſpian Seas, take their riſe from
this elevated region, which at preſent compoſes
the ſouthern part of Siberia and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>artary. It
is, therefore, in this country, which is more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated
than all the others, ſince it ſerves them
as a centre, and is near five hundred leagues
from any ocean; it is in this privileged country
that the firſt people worthy of notice were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
and they merit our eſteem as the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of arts, ſciences, and every uſeful inſtitution.
This truth is equally evident from the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of natural hiſtory, and from the almoſt
inconceivable progreſs of aſtronomy. How
could men ſo new invent the luniſolar period of
ſix hundred years? I confine myſelf to this
ſingle fact, though many others equally wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and permanent might be produced. Theſe
people, therefore, knew as much of aſtronomy as
was known in the days of Caſſini, who firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
the reality and exactneſs of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of ſix hundered years; a knowledge of
which the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks,
were perfectly ignorant; a knowledge which
preſuppoſes that of the exact movements of the
earth and moon, and requires great perfection in
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0195500109:393"/>
the inſtruments neceſſary to make obſervations;
a knowledge, which, as it implies the acquiſition
of every thing derived from a long ſucceſſion of
aſtronomical ſtudy and reſearch, muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at leaſt two or three thouſand years exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the human mind.</p>
                  <p>Theſe firſt people, becauſe they had become
very learned, muſt have been proportionally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
They muſt have enjoyed many ages of
peace and leiſure, which are neceſſary for the
cultivation of ſcience. Before they could enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a ſuſpicion concerning the period of ſix
hundred years, at leaſt twelve hundred years of
aſtronomical obſervations were requiſite; and,
to aſcertain the fact, more than double that
number of years were neceſſary. Thus we
have already about three thouſand years employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in aſtronomical ſtudies: Neither ſhould this
circumſtance ſurpriſe us; for, in reckoning from
the Chaldean aſtronomers to the preſent day, an
equal time has been employed in diſcovering
this period of ſix hundred years. Beſides, theſe
three thouſand years of aſtronomical obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
muſt neceſſarily have been preceded by
many ages in which ſcience was unknown. Nay,
are ſix thouſand years from the preſent time
ſufficient to diſcover the moſt noble epoch in
the hiſtory of man, or even to trace his gradual
progreſs in the arts and ſciences?</p>
                  <p>But, unhappily theſe ſublime and beautiful
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0195500109:394"/>
ſciences are loſt: We can only recogniſe their
paſt exiſtence by deformed and imperfect frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The invention of the <hi>formula</hi> by which
the Brahmins calculate eclipſes, preſuppoſes as
much ſcience as the conſtruction of our Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides;
and yet theſe Brahmins have not the
ſmalleſt idea of the ſtructure of the univerſe.
They poſſeſs only ſome falſe notions concerning
the motion, magnitude, and poſition of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
They calculate eclipſes without knowing
the theory of them. This operation they are
enabled to perform by machines or tables found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon learned formulae, which they do not
comprehend, and which, probably, were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by their anceſtors; becauſe they have
never brought any thing to perfection, and
have not tranſmitted the ſmalleſt ray of ſcience
to their deſcendants. In their hands, theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulae
are only practical methods; but they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
profound knowledge, of which theſe people
have not preſerved the ſlighteſt veſtige, and
which, of courſe, they have never poſſeſſed.
Hence theſe methods could only proceed from
that ancient people, who had reduced into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulae
the motion of the ſtars, and who, by a
long courſe of obſervations, could not only
predict eclipſes, but, what is much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
they recogniſed the period of ſix hundred
years, and, of courſe, were acquainted with all
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0195500109:395"/>
thoſe aſtronomical facts which this diſcovery ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
required.</p>
                  <p>I may affirm, that the Brahmins never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
theſe formulae; becauſe all their phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
ideas are contrary to the theory on which
theſe formulae depend. If they had compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
this theory, even at the time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
its reſults, the ſcience would have been
preſerved, and they would not, as they do at
preſent, have entertained the moſt abſurd and
ignorant notions concerning the ſyſtem of the
univerſe; for they believe that the earth is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
and is ſupported by a mountain of
gold; that the moon is eclipſed by aerial dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons;
that the planets are ſmaller than the
moon, &amp;c. It is therefore evident, that they
never had the firſt elements of aſtronomical the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
nor the ſmalleſt knowledge of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
upon which the methods they employ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend<note n="*" place="bottom">For a more complete view of this ſubject, I refer the reader to an excellent account of ancient aſtronomy lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Bailly, whoſe ideas perfectly coincide with mine.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Chineſe, who are a little more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
than the Brahmins, calculate eclipſes in a
very rude manner, and they have continued to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
them in the ſame manner for two or three
thouſand years. As they bring nothing to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they can never invent. Hence ſcience neither
originated in China nor in India. Though equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
near as the Indians to the firſt learned people,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0195500109:396"/>
the Chineſe appear not to have derived any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from this favourable ſituation. They
are not even poſſeſſed of thoſe aſtronomical for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulae
of which the Brahmins have preſerved
the uſe, and which conſtitute the firſt great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of the knowledge and happineſs of
man. Neither does it appear that the Chaldeans,
Perſians, Egyptians, or Greeks, received any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from this firſt enlightened race of
men; for, in theſe Levant countries, the new
aſtronomy muſt be aſcribed to the indefatigable
aſſiduity of the Chaldean obſervers, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the labour of the Greeks, which can
only be dated from the foundation of the Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian
ſchool. This ſcience, however, after the
culture of two thouſand years, and even till theſe
two or three laſt centuries, was very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
It ſeems, therefore, to be certain, that theſe
people, who firſt invented, and for a long ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of ages ſo happily cultivated aſtronomy,
have left nothing but ſome fragments, ſome
reſults of the ſcience, which might be retained
in the memory, ſuch as that of the period of ſix
hundred years, which has been tranſmitted to us
by Joſephus the Jewiſh hiſtorian, who did not
underſtand its value or import.</p>
                  <p>The loſs of the ſciences, that firſt wound to
humanity inflicted by the ſword of barbarity,
muſt have been the effect of ſome direful revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
which, in a few years perhaps, deſtroyed
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0195500109:397"/>
the labours and the ingenuity of many ages; for
thoſe firſt powerful and learned people muſt
have continued long in a ſtate of ſplendour and
proſperity, ſince they made ſo great progreſs in
the ſciences, and, of courſe, in all the arts
which the ſtudy of them neceſſarily require.
But it is extremely probable, that, when the
regions to the north of this happy country, had
become too cold, their inhabitants, ſtill igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
ferocious, and barbarous, would pour in
upon this rich and cultivated country. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
aſtoniſhing, that theſe barbarians ſhould have
been able to annihilate not only the principles,
but the remembrance of all ſcience. Three
thouſand years of ignorance, perhaps, followed
the three thouſand years of light and knowledge
which had preceded them. Of all theſe firſt and
beautiful fruits of the human genius, there now
remains nothing but a meta phyſical religion,
which, being incomprehenſible, required no
ſtudy, and could neither be altered nor loſt but
by a defect of memory, which never fails when
it is ſtruck with the marvellous. From this firſt
centre of the Sciences, the ſame metaphyſical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

ſtill farther, and is adopted as an article of
faith by the Indians, the Aethiopians, and the
Atlantes. The ſame notions, a little diſguiſed,
were received by the Chineſe, Perſians, Greeks,
and Romans. Every circumſtance concurs in
proving, that the firſt common ſtem of human
knowledge aroſe in this region of Aſia<note n="*" place="bottom">The learned M.

that its barren or degenerated branches extended

                  <p>The paſt ages of barbarity are for ever buried
in profound darkneſs. Men were then ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with ignorance, that human nature was
hardly recogniſable: For rudeneſs, followed by
the neglect of duty, began to relax the bonds of
ſociety, which were afterwards torn aſunder by
barbarity; the laws were deſpiſed or proſcribed;
manners degenerated into habits of ferocity;
the love of ſociety, though engraven on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
heart, was totally effaced; in a word, man,
without education, without morals, was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to lead a ſolitary and ſavage life, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the high dignity of his nature, preſented
the picture of a being degraded below the brutes.</p>

However, after the loſs of the ſciences, the
uſeful arts to which they had given birth were
preſerved. The cultivation of the earth, which
became more neceſſary in proportion to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of population; all the arts and practices
which this culture requires, as well as all thoſe
employed in the conſtruction of buildings, in
the fabrication of idols and arms, in the weaving
of ſtuffs, &amp;c. ſurvived the ſciences. Theſe arts
were gradually diffuſed and brought to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
They followed the courſe of population.
The ancient empire of China firſt aroſe, and
nearly at the ſame time that of the Atlantes in
Africa. The empires on the continent of Aſia,
thoſe of Egypt and Aethiopia, were ſucceſſively
eſtabliſhed, and, laſtly, that of Rome, to which
our Europe owes its civil exiſtence. Hence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three thouſand years only have elapſed
ſince the power of man united with that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſpread over the greateſt part of the
earth. Before this period, the treaſures of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
were buried. The other reſources of man,
ſtill more profoundly interred, could not elude
his reſearches, but have become the reward of
his labours. When he conducted himſelf with
wiſdom, he followed the leſſons of Nature;
he derived advantage from her examples; he
employed her means, and, from the immenſity
of her productions, ſelected all thoſe objects from
which he could derive either utility or pleaſure.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0195500109:400"/>
By his intelligence the animals were ſubdued,
tamed, and reduced to perpetual ſlavery. By
his labours, the marſhes were drained, the rivers
were reſtrained, and their cataracts effaced, the
foreſts were cleared, and the earth cultivated.
By his reflection, times were computed, ſpaces
were meaſured, the celeſtial motions were recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed,
combined, and repreſented, the heavens
and the earth were compared, the univerſe was
augmented, and the Creator worthily adored.
By his art, which is an emanation of ſcience,
the ſeas have been traverſed, and the mountains
overcome; nations have been united; a new
world has been diſcovered; a thouſand other
detached lands have been reduced under his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
laſtly, the whole face of the earth
at preſent exhibits the marks of his power,
which, though ſubordinate to that of Nature,
often exceeds, at leaſt, ſo wonderfully ſeconds
her operations, that, by the aid of his hands, her
whole extent is unfolded, and ſhe has gradually
arrived at that point of perfection and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
in which we now behold her.</p>
                  <p>Compare rude with cultivated Nature. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the ſmall ſavage nations of America with
thoſe of our civiliſed people, or even with thoſe
of Africa, who are only half cultivated. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the condition of the lands which
thoſe nations inhabit, and you will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the inſignificance of men who have made
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0195500109:401"/>
ſo little impreſſion on their native ſoil. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from ſtupidity or indolence, theſe brutiſh
men, theſe unpoliſhed nations, great or ſmall,
give no ſupport to the Earth; they ſtarve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fertilizing her; they devour every thing,
and propagate nothing. The ſavage ſtate, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is not the moſt deſpicable condition of
mankind, but that of thoſe nations who have
juſt begun to be poliſhed, who have always been
the real ſcourges of human nature, and who,
even at preſent, can hardly be reſtrained by the
people who are completely civiliſed. They have,
as formerly remarked, ravaged the firſt happy
land. They have torn up the germs of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and deſtroyed the fruits of ſcience. How
many invaſions have ſucceeded this firſt irruption
of barbarians? From theſe ſame northern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
where every human virtue formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted,
all our evils afterwards proceeded. How
often have we ſeen theſe irruptions of animals
with human faces, who always come from the
north, ravage the countries of the ſouth? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the annals of all nations, and you will find
twenty ages of deſolation, for a few years of
eaſe and tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>Nature required ſix hundred ages to conſtruct
her great works, to temper the earth, to faſhion
its ſurface, and to arrive at repoſe: How many
ages would men require before they ceaſed to
diſturb and deſtroy each other? When will they
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0195500109:402"/>
learn, that the peaceble poſſeſſion of their own
country is ſufficient for their happineſs? When
will they be wiſe enough to give up their falſe
pretenſions, to renounce imaginary dominions,
and diſtant poſſeſſions, which are often ruinous,
or at leaſt coſt more than their value? The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
empire in Europe is as extenſive as that of
France, and ten times larger in America; Is it
ten times more powerful? Is it even as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as if this bold and great nation were limited
to derive from its own happy country all the
benefits which it could furniſh? Have not the
Britiſh, a people ſo ſenſible, and ſuch profound
thinkers, committed a great error by extending
too far the limits of their colonies? The ancients
appear to have had more correct ideas with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to theſe eſtabliſhments. They never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
emigrations till their population was too
great, and their territory and commerce were
not ſufficient to ſupply their wants. Have not
the invaſions of barbarians, which we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with horror, had cauſes ſtill more preſſing,
when they found themſelves too numerous in
ungrateful, cold, and naked countries, and at
the ſame time ſurrounded with fertile and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
lands, which produced every article they
required? But, what quantities of blood, what
calamities, what loſſes, have accompanied and
followed theſe direful conqueſts?</p>
                  <p>We ſhall dwell no longer on the diſmal ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of thoſe revolutions of death and devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0195500109:403"/>
which are the genuine effects of ignorance.
Let us entertain the agreeable hopes, that the
balance, though imperfect, which ſubſiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
cultivated nations, will continue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
even more ſtable in proportion as men
ſhall have better notions of their real intereſt;
that they will learn the value of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil
happineſs; that the acquiſition of this object
will be the chief aim of their ambition; and
that Princes will diſdain the falſe glory of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
and deſpiſe the little reſtleſs vanity of
thoſe who excite them to ſuch dreadful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe the world in peace, and take
a nearer proſpect of the influence of man's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over that of Nature. Nothing appears to be
more difficult, not to ſay impoſſible, than to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſucceſſive cooling of the earth, and to
warm the temperature of a climate; yet this
feat man can and has performed. Paris and
Quebeck are nearly under the ſame degeee of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
Paris, therefore, would be as cold as
Quebeck, if France and the adjacent countries
were as thinly inhabited, and as much covered
with wood and water as the territories in the
neighbourhood of Canada. The draining, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and peopling a country, will give it a
warmth which will continue for ſome thouſand
years; and this fact will prevent the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0195500109:404"/>
objection which can be made againſt my
opinion, that the earth is gradually cooling.</p>
                  <p>According to your ſyſtem, it may be ſaid, the
whole earth muſt be cooler now than it was two
thouſand year ago: But tradition proves the
contrary. France and Germany formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
rain-deer, lynxes, bears, and other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
which have ſince retired to more northerly
regions. This progreſs is very different from
what you maintain, namely, from north to
ſouth. Beſides, hiſtory informs us, that the
river Seine was annually frozen during a part
of the winter. Are not theſe facts a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the gradual cooling of the earth?
They would, I acknowledge, if France and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
were now in the ſame ſtate; if we had
not cut down the foreſts, drained the marſhes,
confined the torrents, directed the rivers, and
cleared all the lands which were overgrown
with unprofitable plants. But we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that the heat of the globe diminiſhes in
an imperceptible manner; that ſeventy-two
thouſand years were neceſſary to cool it to a
proper temperature, and that an equal portion
of time muſt elapſe before it is ſo cold as to be
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it for the nouriſhment of animals and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.
We muſt conſider the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this ſlow cooling of the earth and the
ſudden colds produced in the atmoſphere; and
we muſt nevertheleſs recollect, that the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0195500109:405"/>
between the greateſt heat of our ſummers,
and the greateſt cold of our winters, exceeds not
a thirty-ſecond part. From theſe conſiderations
it is apparent, that external cauſes have a much
greater influence upon the temperature of every
climate than the internal cauſe, and that, in all
thoſe climates where the cold of the ſuperior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the air is attracted by moiſture, or puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the winds towards the ſurface, the effects
of theſe particular cauſes are much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than that produced by the general cauſe.
Of this we ſhall give an example, which will
remove every doubt, and at the ſame time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
every ſimilar objection.</p>
                  <p>In the immenſe territories of Guiana, which
are covered with thick foreſts, where the ſun
can hardly penetrate, where great tracts of
country are overflowed with water, where the
rivers are very near each other, and are neither
reſtrained nor directed, where it rains continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
during eight months of the year, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
about a century ago, began to clear the
country arround Cayenne, which is a very ſmall
canton of theſe vaſt foreſts. The difference of
temperature in this little diſtrict is already ſo
perceptible, that the people are too warm during
the night; but, in all the lands which are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with wood, the nights are ſo cold that ſires
are neceſſary in the houſes. The ſame effect is
produced with regard to the quantity and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0195500109:406"/>
of the rains: They ceaſe ſooner and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
later at Cayenne than in the interior parts
of the country; neither are they ſo heavy, nor
ſo frequent. At Cayenne, there are four months
of abſolute drineſs: But, in the interior parts of
the country, the dry ſeaſon laſts only three
months; beſides, a daily rain is brought down
by the ſouth winds, which is pretty violent. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
circumſtance merits attention: It ſeldom
thunders at Cayenne; but, in the interior parts,
where the clouds are black, thick, and very low,
the thunder is violent and very frequent. Theſe
facts ſhow, in the cleareſt manner, that, in this
country, the eight months of perpetual rain
might be diminiſhed, and the heat greatly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
if the foreſts were cut down, if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were reſtrained, and the rivers properly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and if the cultivation of the earth,
which ſuppoſes the movements of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men and animals, baniſhed that cold and
ſuperfluous moiſture which is attracted and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
by the immenſe quantity of vegetables.</p>
                  <p>As every action, every movement, produces
heat, and as all beings endowed with the faculty
of progreſſive motion, may be conſidered as ſo
many little fires, it is in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men and animals, that (every thing elſe
being equal) the local temperature of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
country depends. The former diffuſe heat,
the latter nothing but cold and moiſture. The
perpetual uſe men make of fire adds greatly to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0195500109:407"/>
the artificial temperature of all populous terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.
In Paris, during great colds, the ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometers
at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré ſtand
two or three degrees lower than thoſe at the Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg
Saint-Merceau; becauſe the north wind is
heated in paſſing over the numerous chimneys
of that great city. A ſingle foreſt in any country
is ſufficient to produce ſome change in its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.
Trees attract the cold; by their ſhade
they diminiſh the heat of the ſun; they produce
moiſt vapours that form clouds and fall down in
rain, which is always colder from the greater
height it deſcends. When theſe foreſts are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
to Nature alone, the old trees fall and
coldly corrupt; but, when under the dominion
of man, they are uſed as fewel to the element
of fire, and become the ſecondary cauſes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular heat. In meadows, before the
herbage is cut down, there are always copious
dews, and often ſmall ſhowers of rain, which
ceaſe as ſoon as the graſs is carried off. Theſe
ſmall rains would become more abundant and
more durable, if our meadows, like the ſavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs
of America, were always covered with the
ſame quantity of herbs, which, inſtead of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
muſt increaſe by the accumulating ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
of all thoſe that die and corrupt on the
ſurface.</p>
                  <p>Many other examples might be given, all
concurring to ſhow that man can have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0195500109:408"/>
on the climate he inhabits; and; in a
manner, fix its temperature at any point that
may be agreeable to him; and; what is ſingular,
it is more difficult for him to cool than to heat
the earth. He is maſter of the element of fire;
which he can augment and propagate at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but not of the element of cold, which he
can neither lay hold of nor communicate. The
principle of cold is not a real ſubſtance, but a
ſimple privation, or rather diminution of heat;
a diminution which ought to be very great in
the high regions of the air, and which, at the
diſtance of a league from the earth, converts the
aqueous vapours into hail and ſnow. For the
emanations of the heat proper to the globe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ſame law as all other phyſical quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or qualities which proceed from a common
centre; and, as their intenſity decreaſes in the
inverſe ratio of the ſquare of the diſtance, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be certain, that the atmoſphere is four
times colder at the height of two leagues than
at that of one; each point of the earth's ſurface
being conſidered as a centre. On the other
hand, the interior heat of the globe, in every
ſeaſon, is conſtantly ten degrees above the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
point. Hence the earth can never be cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than ten degrees above this point, except by
the fall of cold matters upon its ſurface from the
ſuperior regions of the air, where the effects of
the internal heat of the globe diminiſh in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0195500109:409"/>
to the height. Now, the power of man
extends not ſo far. He cannot make cold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
as he makes heat aſcend. He has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mode of defending himſelf from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the ſun's rays, but by forming a ſhade.
But it is more eaſy to cut down the foreſts of
Guiana, in order to heat the humid earth, than
to plant trees in Arabia to refreſh the burning
ſands. A ſingle foreſt, however, in the midſt
of theſe parched deſerts, would be ſufficient
to render them more temperate, to attract
the waters from the atmoſphere, to reſtore all
the principles of fertility to the earth, and, of
courſe, to make man, in theſe barren regions,
enjoy all the ſweets of a temperate climate.</p>
                  <p>It is upon the difference of temperature that
the ſtronger or weaker energies of Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
The growth, and even the production,
of all organized beings, are only particular effects
of this general cauſe: Hence man, by modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
this cauſe, may in time deſtroy what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures
him, and give birth to every thing that is
agreeable to his feelings. Happy are thoſe
countries where all the elements of temperature
are balanced, and ſo fortunately combined as to
produce only good effects! But, has any
country, from its origin, ever enjoyed this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege?
Is there any country where the power
of man has not aided that of Nature, either by
attracting or diſſipating the waters, by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0195500109:410"/>
noxious or ſuperfluous vegetables, and by
taming and multiplying uſeful animals? Of
three hundred ſpecies of quadrupeds, and fifteen
hundred ſpecies of birds, man has ſelected nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or twenty<note n="*" place="bottom">The elephant, the camel, the horſe, the aſs, the ox, the ſheep, the goat, the hog, the dog, the cat, the lama, the vigogne, the buffalo; the hen, the ſwan, the guiney hen, the duck, the peacock, the pheaſant, and pigeon.</note>; and theſe twenty ſpecies
make a greater figure in Nature, and are more
uſeful to the earth than all the others: They
make a greater figure, becauſe they are directed
and prodigiouſly multiplied by man. By co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating
with him, they produce all the benefits
which could be expected from a wiſe diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of powers in cultivating the earth, in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the articles of commerce, in augmenting
proviſions, in ſupplying all the wants, and in
miniſtering to the pleaſures of their only maſter
who can reward their ſervices by his induſtry
and attention.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſmall number of animals ſelected by
man, the hen and the hog ſpecies, which are the
moſt prolific, are likewiſe the moſt generally
diffuſed, as if the aptitude for great multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were accompanied with that vigour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
which braves every danger or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
ariſing from difference of climate. The
hen and the hog have been found in the moſt
unfrequented regions of the earth, in Otaheite
and other ſouthern iſlands, which are the moſt
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0195500109:411"/>
remote from any continent, and have, till very
lately, remained for ever unknown. It appears
that theſe ſpecies have followed man in all his
emigrations. In ſouth America, where none of
our animals could poſſibly arrive, we find the
pecari and wild hen, which, though ſmaller and
a little different from the hog and hen of our
continent, muſt be regarded as a ſpecies ſo much
allied that they might eaſily be reduced to a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
ſtate. But ſavage man, having no idea
of ſociety, is not ſollicitous about that of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
In the regions of ſouth America, the
ſavages have no domeſtic animals. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
indifferently the good with the bad ſpecies.
They ſelect none for the purpoſes of rearing and
multiplying them; while a ſingle fertile ſpecies,
like that of the <hi>hocco</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">A large and very prolific bird, whoſe fleſh is as good as that of the pheaſant.</note>, which is at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
would furniſh them, with very little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
more ſubſiſtance than they can procure
by their laborious and painful huntings.</p>
                  <p>Thus the firſt mark of man's civilization is
the empire he aſſumes over the animals; and
this firſt mark of his intelligence becomes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the greateſt evidence of his power over
Nature: For it is only after he ſubjugates and
tames animals, that he is enabled, by their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to change the face of the earth, to convert
deſerts into fertile ground, and heath into corn.
By multiplying uſeful animals, he augments
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0195500109:412"/>
the quantity of life and motion on the ſurface
of the earth; he, at the ſame time, improves
the whole race of beings, and ennobles himſelf,
by tranſforming the vegetable into the animal,
and both into his own ſubſtance, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
diffuſes itſelf by a numerous multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He every where produces plenty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
which is always ſucceeded by great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation.
Millions of men exiſt in the ſame
ſpace which was formerly occupied by two or
three hundred ſavages, and millions of animals
where only a few individuals exiſted. By him,
and for his uſe, all the precious germs are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded;
the productions of the nobleſt kinds
are alone cultivated; upon the immenſe tree of
fecundity the fruitful branches are alone brought
to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Grain, of which man makes bread, is not the
gift of Nature, but the fruit of his reſearches
and of his knowledge in the firſt of all arts. In
no quarter of the earth has wild corn been ever
found: It is evidently an herb brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by his care and induſtry. This precious
plant he muſt have ſelected out of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.
He muſt have ſown and reaped a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of times, in order to diſcover its fertility,
which is always proportioned to the manure
and culture beſtowed upon the ſoil: And the
ſingular quality poſſeſſed by wheat of reſiſting,
in its early ſtate, the cold of our winters,
though, like all other annual plants, it periſhes
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0195500109:413"/>
after yielding its ſeed, and its no leſs wonderful
qualities of being nutritious and agreeable to all
men, to many animals, accommodated to almoſt
every climate, and can be long preſerved without
corruption, and without loſing its power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production;
all theſe circumſtances concur in
proving that it is the moſt happy invention ever
diſcovered by man; and, however ancient it may
be ſuppoſed, it muſt have been preceded by the
art of agriculture founded upon ſcience, and
brought to perfection by experience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>If more modern and even recent examples of
man's power over the nature of vegetables are
required, we have only to compare our pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs,
our flowers, and our fruits with thoſe of
the ſame ſpecies as they exiſted fifty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.
This compariſon may be inſtantly made,
by inſpecting the great collection of flowers,
which was begun in the time of Gaſton d'Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,
and continued to this day, in the Royal
Garden. We ſhall then perceive, perhaps with
ſurpriſe, that the moſt beautiful flowers of that
period, as the ranunculi, pinks, tulips, auricula,
&amp;c. would now be rejected, not by floriſts alone,
but by the moſt vulgar gardeners. Theſe flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
though then cultivated, were not far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from their natural ſtate. A ſingle row of
petals or flower leaves, long ſtamina, and hard
or diſagreeable colours, without variety, and
without delicate ſhades, are the ruſtic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0195500109:414"/>
of ſavage nature. Our pot-herbs conſiſted
of a ſingle ſpecies of ſuccory, and two of lattuce,
both very bad; but we have now more than
fifty kinds of lattuce and ſuccory, all of which
are good. Our beſt fruits and nuts, which are
ſo different from thoſe formerly cultivated, that
they have no reſemblance but in the name,
muſt likewiſe be referred to a very modern
date. In general, ſubſtances remain, and names
change with times. But, in this caſe, names
remain, and ſubſtances are changed. Our peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
our apricots, our pears, are new productions
with ancient names. To remove every doubt
upon this ſubject, we have only to compare our
flowers and fruits with the deſcriptions, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notices of them, tranſmitted to us by the
Greeks and Romans. All their flowers were
ſingle, and all their fruit trees were wild ſtocks,
and their ſpecies very ill choſen: Their fruits, of
courſe, were ſmall, dry, ſour, and had neither
the flavour nor the beauty of ours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe new and good ſpecies originally ſprung
from the wild kinds; but, how many thouſand
times have their ſeeds been ſown before this
happy effect was produced? It was only by ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and rearing infinite number of vegetables
of the ſame ſpecies, that ſome individuals were
recogniſed to bear better and more ſucculent
fruit than others; and this firſt diſcovery, which
ſuppoſes much care and obſervation, would have
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0195500109:415"/>
remained for ever uſeleſs, if a ſecond had not
been made, which implies an equal degree of
genius as the firſt required of patience; I mean the
mode of multiplying by engrafting thoſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inviduals, which unfortunately cannot propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
or tranſmit their excellent qualities to their
poſterity. This fact alone ſhows that theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are purely individual, and not ſpecific; for
the ſeeds of theſe excellent fruits, like the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
kinds, produce nothing but wild ſtocks,
which are eſſentially different.</p>
                  <p>By means of engrafting, however, man has
in a manner created ſecondary ſpecies, which
he can multiply at pleaſure. The bud or ſmall
branch, when united to the wild ſtock, retains
that individual quality which it could not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
by its ſeed; and, in order to produce the
ſame fruit as its original parent, it requires only
to be developed. The fruits receive none of
the bad qualities of the wild ſtock; becauſe it
has not contributed to their formation: It is not
their mother, but their nurſe, which only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
their growth by conveying nouriſhment to
them.</p>
                  <p>In the animal kingdom, moſt of thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which appear to be individual, are propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and tranſmitted in the ſame manner as their
ſpecific qualities. It was, therefore, more eaſy
for man to have influence upon the nature of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
than upon that of vegetables. Particular
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0195500109:416"/>
races in any ſpecies of animals are only conſtant
varieties which are perpetuated by generation.
But, in the vegetable kingdom, there are no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
no varieties ſo conſtant, as to be perpetuated
by reproduction. In the ſpecies of the hen and
pigeon, a great number of races have been very
lately produced, all of which propagate their
kinds. In other ſpecies, we daily rear and improve
races by croſſing the breeds. From time to time,
we naturalize and tame foreign or wild ſpecies.
All theſe recent examples ſhow, that it was long
before man knew the greatneſs of his power,
and that he is not yet fully acquainted with its
extent: It depends entirely on the exerciſe of
his intellect. Thus the more he ſhall obſerve
and cultivate nature, the more expedients he will
diſcover for making her ſubmit, and for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from her boſom freſh ſources of riches,
without diminiſhing the inexhauſtible treaſures
of her fertility.</p>
                  <p>What influence might not man acquire over
his own ſpecies, if his inclinations were always
directed by his intelligence? Who knows to what
degree he might improve his moral as well as
his phyſical nature? Is there a ſingle nation who
can boaſt of having arrived at the beſt of poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
governments, a government which would
render all men not equally happy, but leſs une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
miſerable, by attending to their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by ſoftening their labours, and ſparing
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0195500109:417"/>
their blood by cultivating peace and procuring
abundance of proviſions: This is the moral end
of every ſociety of men who are anxious to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their condition: And, with regard to the
phyſical part of our nature, have the medical
and other arts, whoſe objects are health and
preſervation, made an equal progreſs as the arts
of deſtruction invented for the purpoſes of war
and carnage? In all ages, it appears that man
has reflected deeper and made more reſearches
concerning evil than good. In every ſociety
there is a mixture of both; and as, of all ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which affect the multitude, fear is the
moſt powerful, great talents in the art of doing
miſchief were the firſt which ſtruck the mind of
man; he was afterwards occupied with the arts
of amuſement; and it was not till after long
