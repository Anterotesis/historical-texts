            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WHEN ſly Jemmy Twitcher had ſmugg'd up his face</l>
               <l>With a lick of court white-waſh, and pious grimace,</l>
               <l>A wooing he went, where three Siſters of old</l>
               <l>In harmleſs ſociety guttle and ſcold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Lord! Siſter, ſays Phyſic to Law, I declare</l>
               <l>Such a ſheep-biting look, ſuch a pick-pocket air,</l>
               <l>Not I, for the Indies! you know I'm no prude;</l>
               <l>But his noſe is a ſhame, and his eyes are ſo lewd!</l>
               <l>Then he ſhambles and ſtraddles ſo oddly, I fear—</l>
               <l>No; at our time of life, 'twould be ſilly, my dear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I don't know, ſays Law, now methinks, for his look,</l>
               <l>'Tis juſt like the picture in Rocheſter's book.</l>
               <l>But his character, Phyzzy, his morals, his life;</l>
               <l>When ſhe died, I can't tell, but he once had a wife.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>They ſay he's no Chriſtian, loves drinking and whoring,</l>
               <l>And all the town rings of his ſwearing and roaring,</l>
               <l>His lying, and filching, and Newgate-bird tricks:—</l>
               <l>Not I,—for a coronet, chariot and ſix.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Divinity heard, between waking and dozing,</l>
               <l>Her ſiſters denying, and Jemmy propoſing;</l>
               <l>From dinner ſhe roſe with her bumper in hand,</l>
               <l>She ſtroked up her belly, and ſtroked down her band.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What a pother is here about wenching and roaring!</l>
               <l>Why David loved catches, and Solomon whoring.</l>
               <l>Did not Iſrael filch from th' Aegyptians of old</l>
               <l>Their jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold?</l>
               <l>The prophet of Bethel, we read, told a lie:</l>
               <l>He drinks; ſo did Noah: he ſwears; ſo do I.</l>
               <l>To refuſe him for ſuch peccadillos, were odd;</l>
               <l>Beſides, he repents, and he talks about G--.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Never hang down your head, you poor penitent elf!</l>
               <l>Come, buſs me, I'll be Mrs. Twitcher myſelf.</l>
               <l>D--n ye both for a couple of Puritan bitches!</l>
