            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I AM well aware that ſome of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Letters to be met in this Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will, at firſt Glance, appear too trivial for Publication; and that Perſons, who limit their Peruſal to them, will be apt to pronounce unfavourably of the whole. I therefore think it neceſſary to aſſign my Reaſons for including them, and, at the ſame Time, give a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Work in general.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters are truly, what they are announced in the Title-page, <hi>Genuine.</hi> The Lady, to whom they were written, entruſted me with the Publication. On my firſt Peruſal of them, I thought they contained Matter much too good to be loſt. The moral Leſſons, wherewith they abound, being chiefly calculated for younger Minds, I took the Liberty in my Propoſals to recommend the Work as a
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0720200201:14"/>
proper Companion to the Time of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in both Sexes. Thoſe Letters, which contain Critiques on many celebrated Writers, appeared to me not unworthy the Notice of Men of Reading and Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I reviſed and tranſcribed thoſe on <hi>Homer,</hi> in particular, with the Original, and <hi>Pope</hi>'s Tranſlation at my hand, and can, at leaſt, venture to affirm there is a great Deal of <hi>New</hi> in Mr. <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. I declare, with great Truth, that I have his Reputation at Heart, more than my own Emolument, and therefore hope, for his Sake, my weak Judgment may not be called in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>My Motive for retaining thoſe initiatory Letters, which ſeem leſs conſequential, were partly in hope that they might have the ſame good Effect on other Pupils, which they had on his. It may be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they contain Rules which are to be found in every French Grammar. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But, to uſe a Maxim of our Writer's, may not a Precept or two, ſcattered in this light, epiſtolary Manner, have more Force than all the formal Documents that ever were penned? What has been, may be. I am a Witneſs that his Pupil,
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0720200201:15"/>
profited excellently by this Mode of Inſtruction; I therefore think the Inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them cannot be wholly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; beſide that it gives an Opportunity of admiring that kind and eaſy Pliancy with which a Man of Learning and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius deſcended to the Level of a puerile Comprehenſion.</p>
            <p>I lament that it has not been in my Power to obtain a Sight of the young Lady's Letters. We have her Tutor's Word for her being poſſeſſed of good Senſe and a Quickneſs of Apprehenſion. Her Remarks therefore could not but be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, if not inſtructive; in-as-much as they came pure and genuine from the Heart, unſophiſticated with caſuiſtical Reaſonings or Pedantry of Expreſſion. He frequently mentions the Pleaſure her Letters afford him; unfortunately they are all wanting: ſhe had the Affliction to loſe her Friend and Inſtructor, when he was many Miles diſtant from her, and all Attempts to recover his Papers proved fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>To account for the endearing Terms in which the Tutor ſometimes addreſſes his Pupil, be it known he was her <hi>God-Father</hi>;
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0720200201:16"/>
and his unremitted Attention to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of her Mind demonſtrates how conſcientiouſly he regarded that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Office he undertook at her Baptiſm, which is too often, by the Generality of Mankind, as iniquitouſly neglected, as it inconſiderately aſſumed.</p>
            <p>For the Gratification of ſuch Readers, as wiſh to be more nearly acquainted with Mr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> I have prevailed on the Lady, to ſketch his Character, which I hereunto ſubjoin.</p>
            <p>I have little more to ſay. I mean to give an uſeful Work to the Publick. Should I fail in my Judgment, my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at leaſt, is good; and however weak my Abilities may be, I have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Reflection, that they are dedicated to a <hi>moral Purpoſe</hi>; to which Important End I wiſh that all my little Labours ſhould conduce, as moſt ſuitable to my Inclination, and moſt conſiſtent with my Profeſſion.</p>

            <head>LETTER To the EDITOR.</head>
            <p>YOU aſk me for a Character of my rever'd Mr. <hi>P.</hi> You tell me I muſt haſten, for that the Publication is in great forwardneſs. Alas, what a Taſk have you given me! already have I ſuffered extreme Pain on a Re-peruſal of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which, ſince his Death, I have never dared to look into, till you encouraged me, by ſaying they might be of the ſame Service to others, which they had once been to me. Flattered by this Opinion, I ventured to read them again; all my Affection, all my Gratitude, all my Reſpect awakens; but all embittered by the Recollection of my Loſs; he lives and dies to me again, on this Review of what I owe to him. I am now leſs equal to the Taſk you require of me, than I was, when I firſt delivered the Papers to your Hands. I then deferred writing
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0720200201:18"/>
what you wiſhed, through a Conſciouſneſs of Incapacity, and a Shame at delivering my Sentiments intentionally to the Preſs. That Conſciouſneſs, that Shame, is now abſorbed in my Fears for the ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of my beloved Teacher; what will an idle, a diſſipated Public ſay of theſe valuable Letters? Should they be treated with Scorn, or even Diſreſpect, I ſhall never forgive myſelf. Is it not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Perſons, without a Tythe of his Underſtanding, his Education, or his Virtue, will ſet themſelves up for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners of his Senſe, his Literature, and his Morals? Have not I treſpaſſed on the Duty I for ever owe his Memory in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch a Riſque? My Motive muſt be my Apology; and if the Departed know any thing of the Actions of Survivors, he will know I mean but to purſue his own Plan, of doing as extenſive Good as my Power will let me. To that Public, who will ſhortly receive them, I can only ſay, the favoured Individual, to whom they were addreſſed, owes all the little Merit, you, and her other partial Friends have ever aſcribed to her (under Heaven) to the Leſſons ſhe received from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe Letters; naturally petulant
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0720200201:19"/>
capricious, obſtinate, he knew, with happy Art, how to turn even her Failings to Account; and ſkillfully uſed even the <hi>Curvings</hi> of her Temper as Inſtruments to the Improvement of her Mind. The Letters truly are, what you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them, Genuine; the Writer was a Gentleman of an antient and honourable Family, once of affluent Fortunes; the Name, you have adopted in lieu of his own, indicates the Misfortune of his Life. He was accounted a Man of the firſt Senſe among Men of Senſe; his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was compleat, his Literature deep, yet poliſhed; his Taſte nice, yet not <hi>cavillous</hi>; (if I may uſe the Word) his Wit was as ſound as his Judgment, and as ſweet as his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; his Humour was infinite, and harmleſs as it was pleaſant. This was his Character from Men of Standard Judgment; for it is not to be ſuppoſed that <hi>I,</hi> at any Time, could be capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding this Part of it, much leſs at Sixteen, at which Age I had the Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to loſe him; but what I have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is no more than I have heard of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aſſerted by Perſons of eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for Skill in what they ſpoke of; But his Heart—to deſcribe that, is <hi>properly</hi>
               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0720200201:20"/>
my Province. Yet how ſhall I be equal to it? Pious as a primitive Chriſtian, Chearful in the ſame Degree he was pious; Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in the moſt extenſive Senſe of the Word; Beneficent, as far as a limited Power would let him; Mild in his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Strict in his Actions, Charitable in Thought, Word, and Deed; Merciful even to an Infect; Kind not only in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Act, but his very Addreſs was Kindneſs pourtrayed; yet was he, to uſe his own Words, ſpeaking of Mrs. K. <q>very reſentful, if he conceived himſelf ſlighted.</q> A ſtrong Trait of his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the Pliancy, with which he yielded to his fallen Fortunes, and the <hi>un</hi>-yielding Spirit with which he ſupported an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in deſpight of them. If it would not appear too fanciful I ſhould ſay he united in his Temper the poetical Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Ivy and the Oak. The Misfortune hinted at (owing to Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Principles of his Family early imbibed) in the youthful Part of his Life, depriving him of the Means of providing for a Family equal to their Birth and his Spirit, kept him a ſingle Man; my Father and himſelf, (involved
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0720200201:21"/>
in the ſame Cauſe, and the ſame Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences) were the moſt intimate Friends; he prevailed on Mr. P. to take Charge of me as a God-Child, an Office he held ſo ſacred, that he never took it on him but for me; and, from that Time, he looked on me as his own, and, I'm ſure, felt all the Affection of a Father for me; nor did I ever feel the Loſs of one (my own dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while I was an Infant) till I loſt him.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to fulfil your Requeſt; and be aſſured that neither my Affection or my Gratitude have impelled me to flatter the Character of a Man, whoſe Worth exceeds the Power of Words. That the precious Depoſit, I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your Care, may meet with ſuch a Reception as the Gentleneſs of your own Heart and the Goodneſs of your Intention induces you to think it will, is at preſent the moſt fervent Wiſh</p>

               <p>MY laſt was by Thurſday's Poſt. I received yours Yeſterday, in which you excuſe the Faults of your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, by pleading, that they are not committed through Careleſſneſs; but ſurely you don't look into your Grammar, elſe you would ſpell more correctly, and obſerve the Differences of the Numbers and Tenſes better.</p>
               <p>Your Letters and Tranſlations give me great Pleaſure, there is ſomething ſo much of the French Turn in them.</p>
               <p>They are only the moſt common Things which you overſee. You ſpell
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0720200201:38"/>
Engliſh as well as a Man of Learning does, and much better than the moſt Part of your Sex. I would have you as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at ſpelling French. I don't expect that your Tranſlations ſhould be equal to the Original. How can that be, when the Tranſlation that I ſend you, and which you are to render again into the Original, is ſo widely different from the Original itſelf? But then I would have you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Difference nicely, as it would make a laſting Impreſſion on your Mind. I would have you make ſome Paper up in different Folds; then write your own Phraſe on one Side, and the French Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal on the other, if the Difference is worth noticing; for inſtance, in this Manner:</p>
               <p>

               <p>Yours is not bad French, but then the other is better. If you'll take this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, it will infix the moſt proper and elegant Expreſſion deep in your Mind.</p>
               <p>I ſhall detain you no longer, having many Letters to write.

               <p>I Received yours of the 4th inſtant. I am charmed with the Tranſlation. It is the beſt you have done, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I expected. It is impoſſible
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0720200201:41"/>
that it can be ſo good French, as that of ſo great a Maſter as <hi>Monſ. Perrault</hi>; but, by ſetting them in Oppoſition, you ſee the Difference; and if you will mind it, and keep the Copies, that you may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to them on occaſion, I do not know a better Way to attain to the Purity of the French Language.</p>
               <p>In your Letter you ſay, "La Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration de cela que vous <hi>faire</hi> pardonner, &amp;c." inſtead of "que vous <hi>fait</hi> pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner," and ſo on, in many Inſtances, uſing the Infinitive for the Imperfect of the Indicative Mood. "Ma Tante vous <hi>faire</hi> les Compliments," for vous <hi>fait.</hi>" Theſe Miſtakes are ſo obvious, that nothing but Careleſſneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">She has endeavoured to exculpate herſelf from the Charge of Careleſſneſs, yet here ſhe is again arraigned for it. Probably ſhe was unconſcious of it. She did not mean to be inattentive, and was only hurried on by early Warmth, and wiſhed, if poſſible, to attain the Eſſence of Learning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the neceſſary Forms that lead to it. Such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are not uncommon.</note> can make you fall into
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0720200201:42"/>
them. Vous ne devez pas vous pleindre de peu de Capacité, parceque vous l'avez belle et bonne; et vous en etes bien rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable à Dieu.</p>
               <p>You ſhould carefully remark the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Differences between the French and Engliſh Manner of Speech. This is what we call different <hi>Dialects.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to enumerate them, they are ſo many; but the greateſt ariſe out of theſe Particles <hi>ou, en, du, des, de,</hi> &amp;c. When we would ſay, A thing is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, we uſe this indefinite Expreſſion, "It is ſaid," or. "They ſay." The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0720200201:43"/>
French ſay, "On dit." We say "At that time." They ſay, "Du temps." We ſay, <hi>"In Europe."</hi> They ſay, "Of <hi>Europe."</hi> We ſay, "I have got a Fever." They ſay, "A Fever has taken me." Then the Uſe of <hi>à</hi> or <hi>de</hi> before the Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is very hard to be diſtinguiſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Care; as you will ſee by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the laſt Tranſlation with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. In like Manner, the Difference is difficult between <hi>en</hi> and <hi>dans</hi>; when the Adverb <hi>ne</hi> is to be uſed, and when not. We ſay, "He is richer than you think, &amp;c." The French ſay, "He is richer than you don't think." Then we have an auxiliary Verb, which they want, and which adds great Force and Energy to our Expreſſion on ſome Occaſions; and that is the Verb <hi>do.</hi> When we aver a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0720200201:44"/>
Thing with Vehemence, we ſay, "I <hi>do</hi> ſay ſo—I <hi>do</hi> think ſo." This is much ſtronger than to utter ſimply, "I ſay ſo—I think ſo." You may obſerve the Force of this auxiliary <hi>do</hi> in many other Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

               <p>I HAVE the Pleaſure of yours of the 20th and ſhewed it to your Mama, who was writing to you in the mean Time, but I ſuppoſe her Letter don't reach you till this Night.</p>
               <p>You certainly do not remark the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Original and your Tranſlation, or you would not fall ſo often into Faults which are ſo obvious. You frequently mix Subſtantives and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectives of different Genders together, and Nouns and Verbs of different Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. I have reproved you twice for that word <hi>mis,</hi> which you uſe both in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0720200201:51"/>
the ſingular and plural Number, and yet you have it twice in the laſt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I remarked to you formerly, that you uſed the perfect Time, when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect was more proper; and if you had but compared the Original with your own Tranſlation, you would have found it, as I ſaid. You are to obſerve, as I told you before, when you ſpeak of a particular Thing done ſome time ago, you ſhould uſe the perfect: but when you ſpeak of a Thing uſually done, the imperfect. For Example:</p>
               <p>"Elle mettoit l'Ordre dans la Maiſon du Roi." That is, ſhe <hi>uſed</hi> to do it. But when it is only a peculiar Action done <hi>once</hi> or at a <hi>certain</hi> Time,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0720200201:52"/>"Elle mit l'Ordre," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Obſerve alſo, that they do not uſe the Word <hi>avec</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in ſo extenſive a Senſe, as we do <hi>with</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> What we tranſlate into <hi>with</hi> is ſometimes à, ſometimes <hi>de</hi> in French.<note n="*" place="bottom">As the true Idiom of a Language is generally the laſt Point which is learned, and requires a greater Degree of Comprehenſion than is neceſſary for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding a plain grammatical Rule, I hope this Paſſage will not be deemed too trifling to have been retained. It is poſſible that a young Mind might receive a deeper Impreſſion from meeting a Rule thus in the Courſe of a Letter, than in the formal Mode of Inſtruction.</note> Remark too they ſay, <hi>La Cadette de ces deux,</hi> we ſay, "The youngeſt of the three." The Senſe is the ſame, though the Expreſſion is ſomewhat different; for <hi>Cadette</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies properly, one that is younger. <hi>Le Cadet,</hi> for Example, is <hi>the younger Brother,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0720200201:53"/>
whereas <hi>Cadette</hi> in this Place, implies <hi>the Siſter, who was younger than the other two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they talk of any Thing that we learn they uſe <hi>ſcavoir,</hi> inſtead of <hi>pouvoir,</hi> as you may ſee in the Original, and it is worth your Obſervarion.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay but the Tranſlation has the <hi>true Spirit</hi> of French in it; for this reaſon, it vexes me to ſee you fail in the commoneſt Things. I ſhall not trouble you with a new Exerciſe till Saturday, that you may conſider what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked in this and my fomer Letters, with Care and Diligence.</p>

               <p>I Have the Pleaſure of yours of the 26th. I have not yet ſeen your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; when I do, I ſhall deliver her your Letter.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not diſpute your Care; but there is a wide Difference between taking Care, and taking due Care. We may exerciſe a great deal, but if it is not rightly conducted, it may be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. If you would ſurvey your Verbs with Attention, you would not

I do not expect that you ſhould fall upon the beſt Phraſes in the French Language; that is impoſſible; but when you compare the Originals with your Tranſlations, you ſhould do it with ſo much Accuracy, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the French Phraſes and Idioms ſtrongly on your Mind. Remember what I wrote to you about the Exerciſe <note n="*" place="bottom">The Character of <hi>Finette.</hi>
                  </note> on the other Side; when you lay that and the Original together, you will have a good Opportunity to remark the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Uſe of the perfect and imperfect Tenſe.</p>

               <p>YOU ſtill continue to uſe the ſingular Verb for the plural. Is not this Negligence in the higheſt Degree? Theſe little Faults apart, the Tranſlation is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, by far the beſt you ever made, and you improve in every one. I grant it is your Application to write fine French, that makes you neglect common Things; but then it looks ugly to ſee ſuch good French defective in the very firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that a Beginner would be aſhamed of. I do not think <hi>il cauſoit,</hi> for <hi>il faiſoit,</hi> good French. Pray obſerve the Arange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Original, and compare it with your Tranſlation.

l'Infidelité de cet Homme de retomber</hi>—They ſay, <hi>il fit retomber l'Infidelité,</hi> &amp;c. Hence you may remark that they put as few Words as they can between the Infinitive and the Verb that governs it. After <hi>faire</hi> they never uſe the Particle; for Example, <hi>je le ferai entrer,</hi> and not <hi>d'entrer,</hi> or <hi>à en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trer.</hi>

               <p>I would have you, by all Means, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the <hi>Archbiſhop of Cambray's Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues des Morts,</hi> with the Fables and Lives of the antient Philoſophers: they are all bound up together in one Volume.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0720200201:71"/>
of old Philoſophers, yet you cannot fail of finding many Things, which will be of vaſt Advantage to you, if you duly obſerve them. You will perceive that even the greateſt Men were ſubject to groſs Failings and Follies; but the main Points to claim your Obſervation, are thoſe wiſe Rules and Maxims that were eſtabliſhed among them, ſome by one, ſome by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſalutary Obſervations they made of Men and Things. Theſe, if you conſider them, will be of great Service to you in the Conduct of Life.</p>
               <p>I would have you, my Dear, to read often the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes, Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> and the <hi>Wiſdom of the Son of Sirach.</hi> There are few Books, which I know, fit to be compared

               <p>I would likewiſe recommend to you the 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th Satires of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and the 2d of <hi>Perſius</hi>; and that you would think well and often on them.</p>

will be then no Danger but that you will find People who will love and eſteem you, nay, very probably, even pique themſelves on ſerving you, and be proud to be thought your Friends and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>
               <p>Let me hear from you often, my Dear: write freely. Let me always know what you are about, and what happens to you.

               <p>I Have your agreeable Letter of the 14th inſtant, and would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it before, but that I have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged lately in a little Buſineſs, which has prevented my writing to you ſo often as I intended.</p>
               <p>You want to have long Letters from me; I want the ſame Thing from you. I wiſh you had been particular about your Viſit to Mr. and Mrs. F—, and that you had let me know the Subject your Converſation turned upon. You don't tell me if Mr. W—has ſent the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0720200201:78"/>
of Cambray</hi>'s Book, nor what you think of <hi>Rochefoucault</hi>'s Maxims; but as you are deeply engaged in <hi>Homer,</hi> I can eaſily excuſe that.</p>
               <p>There are infinite Beauties in <hi>Homer</hi>; and though all Tranſlations muſt, in ſome Reſpects, fall ſhort of ſo great an Original, yet I think Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Life and Soul, and Fire of it, in a great Degree. There is not ſuch a vaſt Warmth and Ardour in <hi>Virgil,</hi> but then there is ſuch a Beauty, and, I may ſay, Lovelineſs in him, as paſſes all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; nor is it poſſible for the Heart of a Reader, who is ignorant of this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, to form any Manner of Idea of it. When you read <hi>Pope</hi>'s Tranſlation, you read ſomething like <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf; but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0720200201:79"/>
when you read <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Tranſlation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> you can ſcarce have any Notion or Image of his genuine Excellencies. No Painter ever gave more fine and lively Expreſſion to a Picture, or with more Exactneſs and Judgment, than <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> gives to his Deſcriptions. Nay, if you ſaw the Thing itſelf repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, it would ſcarcely make a deeper Impreſſion. Yet I do not hereby preſume to aver that <hi>Dryden</hi> was a Poet inferior to <hi>Pope,</hi> but he was old, and not à <hi>ſon Aiſe,</hi> when he tranſlated <hi>Virgil.</hi> A bet-Excuſe however may be brought for him; namely, that neither our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor (to my Belief) any other Language in the World, can come up to the Beauty, Elegance and Energy of the matchleſs Original.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0720200201:80"/>Though no one can read <hi>Homer,</hi> who has any (though ever ſo little) Elevation of Fancy, without being charmed with him, yet if we are let into his great Deſign, the Structure and Contrivance of his Fable, the Plot, Conduct, and Execution of the Whole, with what the Criticks call the Characters, the Sentiments, Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Figures, Deſcriptions, &amp;c. I ſay, when theſe Things are duly known, we ſhall have a much greater Pleaſure in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, than otherwiſe we can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attain.</p>
               <p>If you will read <hi>Pope</hi>'s Introduction to the <hi>Iliad,</hi> with Care, it will prove of great Uſe to you. You ſhould alſo make yourſelf acquainted with his Notes; but in order to have a juſt Conception of this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0720200201:81"/>
Stile of Writing. it is neceſſary to pay great Attention to <hi>Boſſu</hi>'s Treatiſe of Epick Poetry. It is commended as the moſt judicious Eſſay on that Subject, that ever was written; and though it be of little Uſe to us, till we are ſomewhat acquainted with Epick Poetry, yet, once dipped into that excellent Way of Writing, it is of infinite Service to give us a true Taſte for it. We ſhould experience the Advantage of it, in a high Degree, through the <hi>Iliad,</hi> the <hi>Odyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi> Many other Epick Poems are written, which perhaps may as well be let alone as read. I except ſome proſe Performances, ſuch as <hi>Telemaque. Taſſo</hi>'s <hi>Jeruſalem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered</hi> has been recommended to me
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0720200201:82"/>
well worth reading: it was originally written in Italian<note n="*" place="bottom">I am apt to think Mr. <hi>Preſton</hi> was not ſingular in having lived many Years ignorant of this beautiful Production. Within the ſmall Circle of my Acquaintance, I have been amazed, on quoting <hi>Taſſo's Jeruſalem,</hi> to find ſeveral Perſons of exquiſite Taſte, and Lovers of reading, utter Strangers to the very Name. It is ſurely an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Poem, and ſhould be univerſally known.</note>. There is, however, I am told, an old Tranſlation of it into Engliſh, by <hi>Edward Fairfax,</hi> which I am going to read forthwith. A Friend, on whoſe Taſte and Judgment I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, aſſures me it is an admirable Work, abounding with exquiſite Poetry, and all the Spirit of an Original. <hi>Statius,</hi> who certainly had a great poetic Genius, wrote an Heroic Poem in Latin, called the <hi>Thebaid</hi>; but it falls ſo infinitely ſhort of <hi>Virgil</hi> in ſome Particulars, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0720200201:83"/>
perhaps in <hi>all</hi> (except in his Fire, of which <hi>Statius</hi> had a large Portion) that his Poem and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s are often oppoſed to each other in <hi>Boſſu,</hi> by way of contraſt; ſo that you may there ſee cloſe and nice Examples of Judiciouſneſs and Injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Beauties and Defects. It might be of great Advantage to you, to have <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> before you, when you read <hi>Boſſu,</hi> that you might immediately conſult the Originals, when any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Quotation is made. There is ſome Part of the <hi>Thebaid</hi> tranſlated by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> but I do not know if the whole is rendered into Engliſh by any Hand. Now if you are inclined to read <hi>Boſſu,</hi> I will ſend it to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0720200201:84"/>There are ſome noble Beauties in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> which I have, with great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, obſerved. Perhaps the chief of them may have been noticed by other People; however as they are <hi>my own,</hi> and not borrowed from, though they may reſemble, others, I flatter myſelf they may not be unwelcome to you.</p>
               <p>To begin with <hi>Homer.</hi> We are to conſider in the firſt Place, what was his Deſign or End in writing an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Poem, abſtracted entirely from the Tendency of the Work.</p>
               <p>The End this Poet propoſed to himſelf, perhaps, was to procure Praiſe, perhaps, Profit. The latter has been too often the Caſe of Poets, and if the Tradition be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0720200201:85"/>
true, that <hi>Homer</hi> was blind and poor, it might have been the ſame with him. <hi>Horace</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſes of himſelf,
<q>
                     <l>Paupertas impulit audax</l>
                     <l>Ut Verſus facerem—<hi>to wit,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Poverty, which is impudent, compelled me</l>
                     <l>to write Verſes.</l>
                  </q>
Yet when we conſider the Sublimity, and almoſt Divinity of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Writings, we are ſurely tempted to think that he was not poor; if he was, how much is he to be admired and revered, who ſcorned to ſtoop to low diſgraceful Subjects, by which, however, he might poſſibly have obtained an eaſier and more plentiful Subſiſtence, than by producing ſuch a laborious, ſublime and uſeful Work!</p>
               <p>It is probable that the <hi>Aeneid</hi> was wrote with a Deſign to compliment <hi>Auguſtus

                  <hi>Virgil</hi> founds, his Subject on the Actions and Sufferings of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> till he ſettled, a new Empire in <hi>Italy</hi>; and the Leſſon, to be deduced from it, ſeems to be, the great Efficacy of a due Mixture of active and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0720200201:88"/>
paſſive Virtues. His <hi>Aeneas</hi> is wiſe, juſt, pious, valiant, good-natured, patient, and firm to his Purpoſe. Theſe Virtues carry him, at laſt, through all his Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; but his Patience and Piety, ſeem moſt important to him. This is nicely judicious in the Author, to make the Hero owe his Happineſs to his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining Endurance of Hardſhips, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Submiſſion to the Will of Heaven, and his pious Affection for his Father, his Son, his Friends, and his People; hence he is beloved of them all; and we find, notwithſtanding his long Sufferings, he was the peculiar Care of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Man is not a faultleſs Being. <hi>Virgil</hi> therefore did not chuſe to draw his Hero out of Nature. He has deſcribed him with the Imperfections of a human Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0720200201:89"/>
He is very culpable in his Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to <hi>Dido.</hi> This is his great Fault; but you ſee, the Author has judiciouſly attributed that to him, which the greateſt of Men are liable to, and the beſt of Men ſometimes fall into. <hi>Aeneas</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever acted not half ſo bad a Part by <hi>Dido,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did with reſpect to <hi>Bathſheba</hi> and <hi>Uriah</hi>; and yet you ſee, it coſt <hi>Aeneas</hi> very dear, and it was not without great Grief and Anguiſh of Heart, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated himſelf at laſt. Suppoſing the Story to be true, a Man of ſo much Goodneſs of Diſpoſition as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> muſt have had many bitter Reflections, during the whole Courſe of his Life, for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the fatal Event which attended it.</p>

of Virtue expoſes herſelf to, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to give way, though ever ſo ſlightly, to the firſt Advances towards illicit Love. To your Sex ſhe ſhould be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Warning. It is worth your while to ſet the Picture before you. We will forget the <hi>Queen,</hi> and conſider her as more Woman. We find her ſtruggle with her Inclination, at firſt, and even ſwear againſt giving way to her Paſſion; yet ſhe liſtened with Pleaſure to every thing <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſaid. By Degrees ſhe is overcome. She then throws off all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and Shame; neglects her Affairs, gadds about with him from Place to Place, throwing aſide all the Decorum of her Sex and Situation; rides and hunts with him. At length, poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! ſhe finds he is going to forſake her.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0720200201:91"/>
She ſtorms and threatens, weeps, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats by Fits; now ſends a reſentful, now a ſubmiſſive Meſſage. He anſwers all with Reſpect, and Good-manners, but at he ſame Time, with Coldneſs and Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. This Treatment fills her with Agony unſpeakable. Reſt and Sleep are utter Strangers to her. At length, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from <hi>Carthage</hi>; then ſhe becomes diſtracted, expoſes herſelf to the whole City, execrates herſelf for not having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him, his Son and herſelf; ſhe then ſinks again into Complaints and Lamentations, till ſhe is loſt in Deſpair, and reſolves to ſacrifice her Life. Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this horrid Determination, ſhe becomes outrageous, and flies through her Apartments with the Looks and Fury

of a Fiend, devoting him and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to endleſs Torments. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents he had made her then meet her Eyes; ſhe diſſolves into Tears at the Sight, and moans, in painful Recollection, over the happy Hours ſhe had paſſed with him. Unable longer to endure the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Torments that ſurround her, ſhe ſlays herſelf with a Sword, which had belonged to the Author of them, and in the Agonies of Death throws her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the rich Apparel he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. Be it not forgot that, in this Act of Deſpair, ſhe placed the Picture <note n="*" place="bottom">It is remarkable, that in ſome capital Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Death of <hi>Dido,</hi> this very natural and ſtriking Circumſtance of the Picture is omitted by the Artiſts.</note> of her Lover on the funeral Pile.

               </opener>
               <p>THE Beauties, and various Incidents in the Fourth Book of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> engaged me ſo cloſely, as to make me
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0720200201:95"/>
poſtpone what I ſhould before have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, namely the Tendency of this moſt noble Poem. I now come to it.</p>
               <p>Near the Beginning of the firſt Book, <hi>Virgil</hi> makes this Reflection, "So great a Taſk was it to found the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Tantae Molis erat Romanam condere Gentem;</q> 
                     <p>So it runs in the Original, and in <hi>Dryden</hi>;</p> 
                     <q>
                        <l>Such Time, ſuch Toil requir'd the Roman Name,</l>
                        <l>Such Length of Labour for ſo vaſt a Frame.</l>
                     </q>
                  </note>." From which I am of Opinion that the immediate and particular Deſign of his Work was to imprint on the Minds of the <hi>Romans,</hi> his Countrymen, a great Eſteem for themſelves, a paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love for their Country, and a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0720200201:96"/>
Piety and Gratitude towards the Gods; thoſe Gods, who had fought for them, who had led them through ſo many Dangers and Difficulties, and, after ſuch ſevere Encounters with other Nations, and even with ſome of the Deities themſelves who were Enemies to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> had, at laſt, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled them in that fine Country of <hi>Italy,</hi> and from ſmall Beginnings had enabled them to grow up to ſuch a Height as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the World had never ſeen before, nor ever ſhall again.</p>
               <p>If this was <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Deſign (and ſurely it is very probable) how agreeable is it to what we find in holy Writ! <hi>Jacob</hi> ſays,</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0720200201:97"/>I have paſſed over this Brook with my Staff, and now I am become two Bands.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the Iſraelites, that they were the feweſt of all People, and God had made them a mighty and a ſtrong Nation. This is in order to excite in them Gratitude and Piety. <hi>David,</hi> in a hundred Places, mentions the Aſſiſtance of God, whereby, from a low and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>picable Eſtate, he was become great and mighty.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I am poor and needy, but the Lord careth for me.</p>
                  <p>He teacheth my Hands to fight.</p>
                  <p>A Bow of Braſs is broken by my Arms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0720200201:98"/>By my God I ſhall leap over a Wall.</p>
                  <p>He ſubdueth the People under me.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <q>As the Lord liveth, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed my Soul out of all Adverſity.</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Virgil,</hi> when he wrote his <hi>Aeneid,</hi> ſeems to have been poſſeſſed of the ſame Sentiments as thoſe of <hi>David, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> It appears manifeſtly ſo by the Spirit, which runs through his whole Work.</p>
               <p>We find him every where in love with Piety, Prudence, Patience, Conſtancy of Mind, Modeſty, Humanity, Candour and in ſhort with all that is praiſe-worthy. He has beſide a Paſſion for the Belles-Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0720200201:99"/>
and Arts and Sciences, in general; and by his Maxims, recommends a ſober, induſtrious Life and Contentment with a little, rather than we ſhould proſtitute our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and our Principles for Gain; ſo that this noble Work is not only a fine Poem, but moreover a compleat Syſtem of Morality.</p>
               <p>Not only the Virtues above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are recommended, and placed in a favourable Light, throughout the whole Work, but their contrary Vices are branded with Infamy and Deteſtation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hurtful, if not fatal to the Perſons, poſſeſſed of them. The Author makes Virtue and Piety carry People through all Difficulties; that is, in moſt Inſtances, but he has peculiar Exceptions. He knew too much of the World and of Nature,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0720200201:100"/>
to make it always ſo. This would have been contradictory to Experience, and even his own Maxims; for he frequently gives us plain Intimations, that it often pleaſes Providence to do, and bring about Things, which we cannot account for. You may remember, for Inſtance, that at the Burning of <hi>Troy, Aeneas</hi> loſt his wife, <hi>Creuſa,</hi> in the Confuſion. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and went again through all his Dangers, in queſt of her. At laſt, ſhe <hi>appears</hi> to him, and deſires him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy no more Sollicitude about her, for he was never to ſee her again. She adds, that ſuch Things do not happen but by the Will and Ordination of Heaven; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that it was the great Mother of the Gods, who had detained her in thoſe Parts, purpoſely that ſhe might not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0720200201:101"/>
be enſlaved by the Greeks. Laſtly, ſhe recommends, with great Earneſtneſs, their Son <hi>Aſcanius</hi> to his Care, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pledge of their Love. Now, to aſk why a virtuous affectionate Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be ſo dreadfully ſeparated, and why <hi>Creuſa</hi> ſhould periſh in <hi>Troy,</hi> who had not deſerved it by any Crime, were to aſk a preſumptuous and an impious Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, allowing the Story to be true. It was undoubtedly to anſwer ſome great and better Purpoſe, intentionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from our weak Judgments; and this is the Leſſon, which <hi>Virgil</hi> means to give us. <hi>Creuſa</hi>'s tender Concern for her Child is moſt affectingly natural, and the Reality has been verified in the Deathbed Farewel of many worthy Wives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0720200201:102"/>Will you permit me to digreſs one Moment, to mark to you a Beauty of this Kind in our great dramatic Bard, our <hi>Shakeſpeare?</hi> In the third Act of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> when the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> appears to the Prince and his Mother in the Cloſet, "to whet his almoſt-blunted Purpoſe," he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaks from that, to a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and Compaſſion for the Queen's Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0720200201:103"/>To return to <hi>Virgil:</hi> don't you think, Nancy, that if he had lived ſince Popery came into the World, the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics would have ſaid that the Mother of the Gods detaining <hi>Creuſa,</hi> meant that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> had taken her into her eſpecial Service?</p>
               <p>Whenever this Author makes virtuous Perſons ſuffer, it is neceſſary that you ſhould obſerve, he makes them guilty of ſome Fault, which naturally brings on their Diſtreſſes; and it is to ſuch Fault yon muſt attribute them, abſtractedly from their good Qualities. I ſhall give you a ſhort Inſtance or two.</p>
               <p>The hopeful, the beautiful, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Pallas,</hi> was killed untimely, in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0720200201:104"/>
the very Bloom of his Youth; ſo was the charming young <hi>Euryalus,</hi> the only Joy of his Mother, as the other was the only Hope of his Father, <hi>Lauſus</hi> met alſo the ſame Deſtiny, the worthy Son of an unworthy Father.</p>
               <p>Now while you pity them, conſider they were all three too raſh. The Heat of Youth carried them beyond the Bounds of Prudence: they all loved their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and were beloved by them with great Tenderneſs; but that Heat and Impetuoſity rendered them diſobedient. <hi>Pallas</hi>'s Eagerneſs made him <hi>break his Promiſe</hi> to his Father. The Caſe was much the ſame with <hi>Lauſus</hi>; after he had ſaved his Father's Life, his Eagerneſs prevented his attending him, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and often ſent for. <hi>Euryalus</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0720200201:105"/>
an Exploit above his Years, and that without taking Leave of an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Mother. Much is to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from theſe Examples; for though <hi>Virgil</hi> does not expreſſly ſay, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on theſe Accounts, yet he plainly inſinuates it. Again, the impious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Lauſus</hi> is forced to confeſs that his Wickedneſs was the original Cauſe of his Son's Loſs, and owns it to be a juſt Judgment on him.</p>
               <p>By theſe Examples <hi>Virgil</hi> teaches us how dangerous it is to fail in a Point of Duty to Parents, albeit through the mere Frailty of our Nature, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Contempt nor Stubbornneſs of Temper.</p>

               <p>THE infinite Beauties of <hi>Virgil</hi> have carried me ſo much farther than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that, if I can prevail upon myſelf, I ſhall contract what I have to ſay further on this Subject into a narrow Compaſs; though there are ſo many Charms in this glorious Poem, that I ſcarce know how to quit it.</p>
               <p>To point out all the Excellencies of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> it would be neceſſary to repeat the whole Poem. I will therefore only touch on ſome of thoſe Paſſages
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0720200201:107"/>
which pleaſe me moſt, and are, what I judge, the chief Beauties.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Book, we may remark his meeting with his Mother under the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Huntreſs, his going to <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Reception which the Queen gave him, and her becoming enamoured of him; and the Artifice which <hi>Venus</hi> uſed for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Story of <hi>Sinon,</hi> in the ſecond Book, the Return of <hi>Aeneas</hi> to ſeek his Wife, his Interview and Converſation with her Spirit, and the affectionate Care and Anxiety he teſtified for his Father, his Son and whole Family, are very affecting.</p>
               <p>How ſtriking are his Adventures and Diſtreſſes through the whole third Book,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0720200201:108"/>
but particularly his Encounter with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi> and <hi>Andromache!</hi> How natural was all that happened on that Event! The Story of <hi>Achaemenides,</hi> the <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> and the Deſcription of <hi>Aetna!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth Book, the whole Proceſs of the Loves of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido,</hi> with their fatal Conſequences, are beyond all Parallel, all Power of Imitation.</p>
               <p>In the fifth, the funeral Games are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in Honour of <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Mock-fight of the Children, called Ludus Trojanus. Theſe are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the burning of the Ships and Behaviour of the Matrons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0720200201:109"/>The whole ſixth Book is inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fine; his meeting with <hi>Dido,</hi> and their mutual Behaviour thereon; his encountering <hi>Deiphobus</hi> and his Father, and having the Ghoſts of his Poſterity ſhewn him, are all moſt awefully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting. <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> ſeems to have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated this laſt Circumſtance in his <hi>Macbeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How well does he deſcribe the Joys of Heaven and Hell, and what Sort of Inhabitants are to be found in each Place! The chief in Heaven are thoſe, who have ſuffered Wounds and Death for their Country; Prieſts who have lived a holy Life, becoming their Profeſſion; and Bards who have written and sung in pious Strains, not unworthy of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0720200201:110"/>
Gods; intimating, that thoſe who proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute ſuch ſublime Talents to mean and vitious Purpoſes, deſerve nor the Care of Heaven. Next in Degree to theſe are Perſons who have employed their Life in Arts and Inventions, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Mankind, and ſuch as have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed themſelves by doing good.</p>
               <p>In the other State, he allots the greateſt Share of Miſery to thoſe, who, when alive, hated their Brethren. Herein the Writer agrees exactly with what our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> about forgiving his Brother, and what is likewiſe inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many other Parts of Scripture. St. <hi>John</hi> ſays,</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0720200201:111"/>He that ſayeth he loveth God, and hateth his Brother, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</q>
               <p>We next behold thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their Parents, defrauded their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, and deceived ſuch as confided in them; after which come thoſe who have ſate brooding over their Gold, and refuſed to ſhare it with the needy; thoſe who have ſold their Country for mercenary Ends, have wreſted the Laws, and deſtroyed the Conſtitution; and thoſe who have dared to be guilty of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Inceſt. To what noble Purpoſes, my dear Nancy, does this viſionary Scene conduce! How admirably has <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Fancy and Morality gone Hand in Hand!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0720200201:112"/>Do you not admire that charming De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, in the ſeventh Book, of the different Nations who came as Allies to the War, which was impending? Their Behaviour, Habits, Arms, Cuſtoms, how infinitely entertaining! and particularly, the charming Picture of <hi>Camilla,</hi> the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Warrior, and her Troop of Ladies.</p>
               <p>The great Events in the enſuing Part of the Work are, <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Viſit to <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the Converſation and Conſequences, the ſimple Way of Life purſued by that old Prince, the Story of <hi>Cacus,</hi> and that of <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> the Praiſes of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> the Speeches of <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Dran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and the Deaths of <hi>Pallas, Camilla,</hi> and <hi>Lauſus.</hi> What noble Fire and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit does he diſplay, when he deſcribes the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0720200201:113"/>
Conflict between <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus!</hi> and how ſublime are the Sentiments of the latter, when he diſcovers that he had been purſuing a Spectre, inſtead of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and again, when he is about to expire. Theſe, my dear Nancy, are ſuch great and beautiful Paſſages, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to riſe in your Eſtimation, the more you conſider, and the oftner you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe them.</p>
               <p>It is worth your while alſo to obſerve how humane a Man, and how fine a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>Virgil</hi> appears throughout his whole Work. With what Pleaſure does he dwell on Inſtances of Piety, pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Love, filial Duty, conjugal Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Humanity, Hoſpitality, and every ſocial Virtue! With what apparent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0720200201:114"/>
does he ſpeak of a lovely Child, or a promiſing Youth! We ſee Inſtances of this in his <hi>Aſcanius, Aſtyanax, Eurya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Pallas,</hi> and <hi>Lauſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſeems to deſcribe, with no leſs Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Joy, Examples of fond ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Parents, in <hi>Aeneas, Evander, Creuſa Andromache, Amata,</hi> and the Mother of <hi>Euryalus.</hi> He inſtructs us in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human Nature, (wherein he was deeply ſkilled) by painting the Love and Concern for a worthy Son, in the ſavage and impious Mind of <hi>Mezentius.</hi> We may hence derive ſome very important Truths and Leſſons. We learn firſt that Love to our Children is ſo inherent, that Perſons who acknowledge no other Claim, who feel no other Call of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0720200201:115"/>
and who are actually guilty of great Faults, in other Reſpects, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Duty and Affection here. We learn beſide that Worth and Goodneſs will always be beloved and admired, and extort ſome Degree of Approbation, even from the moſt unfeeling Heart. Had the Son of <hi>Mezentius</hi> been leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, probably his Father would not have mourned his Loſs to ſuch Exceſs; <hi>Aeneas</hi> not ſo ſtrongly regretted having killed him; nor would <hi>Virgil</hi> have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed him in ſuch Terms, as (to uſe the Expreſſion of <hi>Horace</hi>) "were worth his dying for." He loſt his Life through his Exceſs of Virtue; he was alarmed with Grief and Fear at Sight of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Danger, ruſhed between him and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and preſerved his Parent. By
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0720200201:116"/>
this we are taught another uſeful Truth; namely, that no Fault of a Parent can ſuperſede the Duty of a Child. He might have eſcaped, after he had preſerved his Father; but Raſhneſs, ſo incident to Youth, drove him to venture beyond his Strength. <hi>Aeneas</hi> fore-warned him; he was deaf to this humane Advice, and his Death was the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>How finely natural is the Interview between <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Andromache,</hi> the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Hector</hi> and Mother of <hi>Aſtyanax!</hi> It is worth your while to place them plainly and exactly before you. She weeps; he ſtands amazed, and can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>hiſs</hi> out (ſuch is the literal Meaning of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Expreſſion) a few Words.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0720200201:117"/>
When ſhe has Power of Utterance, ſhe expatiates on many Subjects at once; ſhe relates the Story of her Life ſince the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> then enquires of his; then queſtions him about his Son, if he was not a promiſing Youth, if he did not copy after him and his Uncle <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?</hi> and if he did not take to Heart the Death of his Mother? At parting from <hi>Aeneas,</hi> ſhe takes Leave of <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>; ſhe calls him the very Picture of her poor <hi>Aſtyanax:</hi> ſhe diſcovers the ſame Countenance, Eyes, and Hands, and that, had he happily ſurvived, he would have been of the ſame Growth. This is the very Strength and Beauty of Nature, whoſe Workings and Effects are the ſame in all Degrees of Life. Our Stations may be different, but our Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0720200201:118"/>
                  <hi>Virgil</hi> not only dwells upon the Duty of Children to their Parents, but even to their Nurſes, to thoſe who have had the Care of their Infancy. He recommends this, and exalts the Character of his Hero, at the ſame Time. That Part of the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Nurſe of <hi>Aeneas</hi> was buried, was called after her Name, and the pious Hero beſtowed on her an honourable Funeral.</p>
               <p>How pleaſing is the Deſcription of <hi>Anna</hi>'s Nurſe (whom <hi>Dido</hi> treated with the ſame Tenderneſs as ſhe would her own, who was deceaſed) with an Intent and buſy Air labouring to execute the Queen's Orders; <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Expreſſion is "Studio anili;" that is, with that Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0720200201:119"/>
and Concern, ſo peculiar to her Age and Office.</p>
               <p>Our Author appears alſo as partially fond of his old Men, who are good and pious; his <hi>Priam, Anchiſes, Evander,</hi> and <hi>Butes. Priam</hi> is the firſt Man to encourage <hi>Sinon,</hi> and <hi>Anchiſes</hi> is the ſame to <hi>Achaemenides.</hi> You ſee the Care and Attention which the Tutor of <hi>Aſcanius</hi> ſhews his Pupil. Thus <hi>Virgil</hi> paints Mankind in every Stage and Station of Life, and in all with equal Propriety: his Judgment never fails him.</p>
               <p>I had forgot to recommend two very fine Paſſages; the Meeting between <hi>Alecto</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> and the Story of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Shield, made by <hi>Vulcan.</hi> Had I

nothing to divert me from this my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Employ of inſtructing you, my Obſervations ſhould be more copious and diſtinct; but ſtill I hope they are what will be of ſome Uſe. If I have not tired you, I will employ another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on this ſame Subject, ſo difficult do I find it to leave this admirable Writer; ever deſiring you to retain in your Mind, that it is not in Order to make you a Critic, only to enable you to read theſe two incomparable Poems, the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Aeneid,</hi> with Pleaſure and Profit.</p>

               <p>I Received yours of the 23d inſtant; it gave me more Pleaſure than I can expreſs. Your Sentiments of particular Paſſages in <hi>Homer,</hi> ſo far as you have read, are juſt and fine, and I deſire you will give me your Thoughts on all the Remainder, as you proceed. <hi>Homer</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſtrikes us more than <hi>Virgil,</hi> at firſt. He ſurpaſſes almoſt all Writers in Loftineſs, in Strength, in Fire, and in a boundleſs Fancy. But more of this at Length, when we come to have him before us, and make him our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0720200201:122"/>
mutual Topic; though, in Truth, you have prevented a good deal of what I ſhould have had to ſay on him, and will continue ſo to do, as you go on. I will now conclude my Obſervations on the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and that in as few Words as poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virgil</hi> makes his Hero not only do hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Offices to his Friends, his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to his Nurſe, but even to his Servants. His Care of the Funerals of <hi>Miſenus</hi> his Trumpeter, and <hi>Palinurus</hi> his Pilot, are Inſtances of this.</p>
               <p>When he deſcribes a funeral Pomp, a Sacrifice, the Admiſſion of an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, the Conſecration of a Trophy, the Celebration of a Feſtival, the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0720200201:123"/>
at declaring War, or concluding Peace, or any Ceremonial whatſoever, it is not only moſt beautifully delivered, but we may be aſſured, he lets us, at the ſame time, into the exact Manners and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans,</hi> on all ſuch Occaſions, ſo that Delight and Inſtruction go Hand in Hand.</p>
               <p>Not only every word in <hi>Virgil</hi> is a Jewel, but they are all ſo put together, that every Sentence may be ſaid to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a String of Jewels ſet to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and the whole <hi>Aeneid</hi> is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, one Part ſo connected with another, that they tend to illuſtrate each other in the moſt ſtriking Colours, and follow in ſuch natural Order and Proceſs, as renders
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0720200201:124"/>
the whole Work beautiful, and places it in the moſt becoming Point of Sight.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that <hi>Virgil</hi> never uſes an idle Word. Although there are ſome things, the Purpoſe whereof we do not perceive, at a firſt reading, yet on nearer obſervation, before, or by the Time we reach the End of the Poem, we plainly diſcover it. I'll give you an Inſtance of this fine Addreſs in <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He makes his Hero not only the greateſt Character in his Work, but alſo the moſt beautiful and virtuous. This is the Reverſe of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Proceeding, who ſeems to make <hi>Hector</hi>'s Character the moſt lovely of his Heroes; (and perhaps both Poets were in the Right, as I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0720200201:125"/>
endeavour to make appear, when we come to compare Notes on the Greek) <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribes <hi>Turnus</hi> fierce and haughty; when he kills <hi>Pallas,</hi> he does it with Pleaſure; he inſults over him, and diſpatches a cruel Meſſage to his Father. He indeed ſends back the Body (for this Author ſeems reſolved not to make <hi>Turnus</hi> ſo ſavage as <hi>Achilles</hi>) but ſpoils him of his Armour, and puts it on himſelf, together with the gorgeous Belt, which <hi>Pallas</hi> wore. Now we ſhould be apt to ſuppoſe, at this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Criſis, that there was nothing more implied herein, than that it was cuſtomary for great Warriors to wear the Arms of Adverſaries, whom they had ſubdued. But we find afterwards
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0720200201:126"/>
that <hi>Virgil</hi> had a particular Uſe to make of this Belt, which he had ſo eſpecially mentioned. <hi>Turnus</hi> puts it on, and wears it in Triumph; whereon the Poet makes a uſeful Reflection, and, at the ſame time, gives us a Hint of what will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. "The Mind of Man," ſays he, <q>elated with Proſperity, is incapable of behaving with Moderation, and blind to Futurity. The Time will come when <hi>Turnus</hi> will ſorely regret that ever he aſſaulted <hi>Pallas.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I will break off here, leſt my Letter ſhould be too long, and give you one more on this Subject.</p>
               <p>The Lines, you have quoted,<note n="*" place="bottom">"As when the Moon, refulgent Lamp of Night," &amp;c. l. 687 to l. 698.</note> are in my Opinion the moſt beautiful in the

               <p>YOUR Letter of the 27th came ſafe to my Hand on the 29th. I really cannot tell you particularly when I ſhall be in Town; but believe it will be ſome Time this Month. My comings depends on the Receipt of ſome Letters from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0720200201:128"/>As you intend to read the <hi>Aeneid</hi> again, there are many things, that I ſhall paſs over, becauſe I would not foreſtall the Pleaſure you are to have, if you read it with due Attention, I ſhall only finiſh the Remark I began about <hi>Pallas</hi>'s Belt.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Aeneas</hi> vanquiſhes <hi>Turnus,</hi> at the latter Part of the Poem, <hi>Turnus</hi> ſues for his Life. Now it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to grant it; and the Nicety was, how to make <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who was ſo famous for Humanity, and a merciful Diſpoſition, not comply with the Requeſt, and yet preſerve his own Character. Behold this very Belt is made uſe of, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and critically meets his Eye at the very Inſtant when his Anger begins to relent and his Heart to melt. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fires, with freſh Reſentment, on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0720200201:129"/>
recollection of the cruel Inſults which <hi>Turnus</hi> was guilty of, when he flew <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.</hi> Hence a noble Indignation, Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and even Compaſſion for the Fate of <hi>Pallas</hi> occaſions the Death of <hi>Turnus</hi>; and thus the Poet, by a beautiful Stroke of Fancy, makes that great Event the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of Friendſhip and Pity, which otherwiſe had been an Act of Cruelty. We learn alſo, from the Inſtance before us, this fine Leſſon, "That what People are moſt proud and vain of, is often the Occaſion of their Ruin." There is a noble Reflection to this Purpoſe at the End of the tenth Satire of Juvenal. All that I have further to ſay about the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> is, to point out to you ſome charming Compariſons, and then I have done with it. This I ſhall do in my next
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0720200201:130"/>

               <p>I would have you, my dear, look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lives of the ancient Philoſophers; and particularly regard their Obſervations made on Life; they will be of great Uſe to you.</p>
               <p>You do not tell me what you think of the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault's</hi> Maxims, and Obſervations.</p>
               <p>I am now going through Ovid's Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſes anew, and the more I read, the more I am charmed with it. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you do not proceed in that Work. No Man ſurely had ever ſo eaſy, ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo charming a Manner of telling a Story.

                  <salute>My Dear Nancy,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Wrote to you on the 1ſt inſtant, with a ſmall Encloſure, which I hope is come ſafe to Hand. It will enable you
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0720200201:132"/>
to buy the <hi>Iliad,</hi> ſince you love it ſo well, and furniſh you with a little Pocket money over and above.</p>
               <p>You neither write me, if you have been to ſee the Lady I recommended, again, nor how you like <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> nor the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray's</hi> Lives of the Philoſophers; but, I fancy, <hi>Homer</hi> engages all your Attention at preſent.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all that I have to ſay about <hi>Virgil,</hi> with pointing out ſome few ſtriking Compariſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0720200201:133"/>In the firſt Book of the <hi>Aeneid, Neptune,</hi> reproving the Winds and the Waves, is well compared to a Man of Merit and Authority ſpeaking to an enraged Mob. In the Fourth, <hi>Dido</hi> to a wounded Deer—and <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to two diſtinct Conflagrations in different Parts of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or two Torrents pouring down a ſteep Hill. When <hi>Aeneas,</hi> after the Arrow was drawn out with which he was wounded, is returning to the Place of Battle, with the whole Corps de Reſerve, while Clouds of Duſt ariſe, and the Earth trembles with the Beating of the Horſes Feet, his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſtruck with Terror, are nobly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Huſbandmen, who ſee a black Storm coming acroſs the Sea, that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens univerſal Ruin, deſtroys the Trees, and lays waſte the Fruits of the Earth.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0720200201:134"/>
The Poet makes it ſtill more terrible by one peculiar Circumſtance, which is a <hi>whiſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Wind, a certain Fore-runner of ſuch a dreadful Storm, as he there deſcribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> purſuing <hi>Turnus,</hi> and not being able to overtake him, is aptly likened to a Hound purſuing a Deer; and this is ſo lively a Repreſentation to one who has ſeen ſuch a Chace, as nothing can ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. ☞ Again <hi>Turnus,</hi> in his Engagement with <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when confounded with Fear and the bad Omens he had met with, and perſuaded the Gods were againſt him, fights indeed, but in ſuch a Manner, as one imagines one does in a Dream. How forcibly pictureſque! But read it. That exceeds all Deſcription.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0720200201:135"/>There is, however, a Compariſon in <hi>Milton,</hi> which is far beyond all I ever read in <hi>Virgil, Homer,</hi> or any where. That is, the Compariſon of <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> to two black Clouds, that fill up the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of the Sky, big with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Lightening and Tempeſt, and at laſt diſcharge their whole Artillery at each other.</p>
               <p>The laſt Obſervation I ſhall make on <hi>Virgil,</hi> is, that he has been a great Lover of what is called the Belles Lettres. We can perceive that be admired Painting himſelf, by what he relates of <hi>Aeneas</hi> admiring the Paintings in <hi>Dido</hi>'s Palace before he broke through the Cloud, and by his charming Deſcription of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Shield. You will find too he loved Statuary
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0720200201:136"/>
Muſick, and Architecture; and you may diſcern the ſame of <hi>Ovid,</hi> in a hundred Places. We ſee two Inſtances of his Skill in the Conteſt between <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Arachne,</hi> and beſide, how nicely he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Art of weaving Arras. I am reading him over, juſt now. He has ſo many beautiful Stories, that I wonder you do not take more Delight in him, than you appear to do. You love Novels; and I never read any ſo beautiful as his, <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thiſbe; Medea</hi> and <hi>Jaſon; Scylla</hi> and <hi>Minos; Cephalus</hi> and <hi>Procris; Ceyx</hi> and <hi>Alcyone; Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda</hi>; the Fable of <hi>Niobe; Pallas</hi> and <hi>Arachne</hi>; the <hi>Muſes</hi> and the <hi>Pierides; Meleager</hi> and <hi>Atalanta,</hi> and a Hundred more, are Stories the moſt exquiſitely told that are any where to be found, and are withal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0720200201:137"/>
Images of Nature. You may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcern through all how the Poet is delighted with whatever is good and virtuous, worthy and laudable; and, on the other Hand, how he deteſts all kind Vice of and Wickedneſs, nay even every Degree of Rudeneſs and Ill-manners.</p>
               <p>It is clear to me that <hi>Ovid</hi> was not only one of the greateſt Wits, and one of the beſt of Men, but one of the beſt-natured, beſt-humoured, and beſt-bred Gentlemen in the World. He wrote indeed with a Sort of Careleſſneſs, and his unhappy Baniſhment hindered him to correct his admirable Poem, the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſes</hi>; which has ever ſince continued the great Fund, whence Sculptors, Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Writers of Operas, and ſome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0720200201:138"/>
other Dramatic Authors have derived their Subjects.</p>

               <p>JUST now I have the Pleaſure of yours of the 28th. You mentioned a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Thirteenth Book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> which was the laſt, on that Subject. I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0720200201:150"/>
am juſt now reading the Obſervations on the Firſt Book. I hope to ſee you on Thurſday Night, or Friday Morning, and when I come, we ſhall compare Notes. I do not mean to be guilty of a Pun here, though it ſounds much like it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall go to-morrow to a Gentleman's Houſe, about twelve miles from this, where I ſhall ſtay three Days, and thence ſet out for London.</p>
               <p>My intended Viſit is not the Call of Buſineſs, but mere Matter of Ceremony, which you know I am not over fond of; yet I think it a kind of Duty to comply with it. The Gentleman was here for a Week, during which Time I converſed with him frequently. He is ſenſible, and his Character good. He preſſed me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0720200201:151"/>
to give him my Company ſome Days at his Retreat, An earneſt Intreaty is a warm Compliment; and as my Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of Humour, namely a diſlike to Strangers, was my ſtrongeſt Objection, I held it incumbent on me, by the Rule of Politeneſs, to ſubmit my own Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity to his. There are many Punctilios, which we ought to give way to, as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Society, if a more important Claim does not interfere.</p>
               <p>Give my Service to the Perſons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in your Letter, and write me by next Poſt. After that, I hope to ſee you before you will have occaſion to write again.</p>

               <p>I WENT to Bed Yeſternight, that is to ſay, this Morning, about two. I was wakened about Five, and in the Coach near half an Hour after Seven. We got to Uxbridge before Twelve, where we took Breakfaſt; but I had wiſely drank
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0720200201:153"/>
three Diſhes of Coffee, and eaten a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Toaſt before-hand.</p>
               <p>We arrived here before Five. We dined; and now after finiſhing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Letter, I write you this, deſiring you not to neglect the Encloſure. My Health is not clever, but I hope to ſleep well to-night, and then I ſhall be right again. To Children, and Perſons advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Life, Sleep is a Medicine for many Ills; and ſurely the pleaſanteſt of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. Did you ever read <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>'s Tragedy of <hi>Macbeth?</hi> if not get it, and ſend me your Opinion of it. I will tranſcribe his Paſſage on Sleep, which, for the luxuriant Variety of ſweet and no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble Images, is ſcarce to be equalled.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0720200201:154"/>
                  <l>The innocent Sleep,</l>
                  <l>Sleep that knits up the ravell'd Sleeve of Care,</l>
                  <l>The Death of each day's Life, ſore Labour's Bath,</l>
                  <l>Balm of hurt Minds, great Nature's ſecond Courſe,</l>
                  <l>Chief Nouriſher in Life's Feaſt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>What a Group of beautiful Images are here! Nor has the great Bard aſſembled them merely to indulge his fine Fancy; no, they are of a Piece with the great Action of the Scene, and anſwer an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant moral End; for by how much he endears to us the ineſtimable Bleſſing of Sleep, by ſo much he aggravates the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Crime of Murder, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion whereof <hi>Macbeth</hi> is but juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. Obſerve too the firſt Epithet which he gives to Sleep, <hi>innocent</hi>; it is very copious. It not only implies that Sleep is innocent in itſelf, that while we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0720200201:155"/>
ſleep, we are free from Guilt, but that Sleep moſt naturally dwells with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and undiſturbed Minds.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt but I ſhall dream of you to-night for I have been dreaming of you all Day. I ſhall write you again on Sunday, and include a ſmall Miſſive to Mr. K—, which you will deliver when you think fit. Give my humble Service to your Mama and Aunt, and believe me to be moſt truly</p>

               <p>I HAD the Pleaſure of yours of the 25th, the next Day after it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. I have very little to ſay at preſent
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0720200201:158"/>
and believe I ſhould not write at all till another Occaſion, were it not for the Pleaſure I take in converſing with you, and for fear you ſhould think I forget you, which I never do.</p>
               <p>I greatly approve your not going to Mr. K—, till you have an abſolute Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for that was the Purpoſe of giving you the Credit. You know, my dear, young as you are, I have not ſcrupled to acquaint you exactly what I hold in truſt for you; and it would be Folly to laviſh away in Trifles what is meant for mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Uſes; beſides you would neither have the Satisfaction nor Advantage that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, if you were to miſemploy your little Fortune. But I am counſelling one, who wants no Advice in theſe Points. My
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0720200201:159"/>
Letter of Credit is not in Force till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow; but you did not know that, and I am pleaſed you did not; as in that Caſe, your poſtponing your Claim had been the Conſequence of my Advice, which is now the Reſult of your own Prudence. Purchaſe the Capuchin you mention, if you have a Fancy for it, be the Price what it may. There is no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a trifling Oeconomy in Matters which are real Neceſſaries of Life. To retrench in Superfluities is our chief Duty, and ought to be our conſtant Care. Were this Point generally attended to, I believe moderate Incomes would go much farther than they do at preſent.</p>
               <p>Have you made the Improvements in your Apparel, which I recommended? Have you ſeen your agreeable Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?

               <p>I Should begin this Letter with <hi>Homer,</hi> and proceed in Form and Order, but I have ſo many Letters to write this Day,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0720200201:161"/>
that I dare not venture on it. I ſhall only mark out two or three Paſſages in the Fourth Book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> which I have juſt now read, and which I think pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly fine.</p>
               <p>The firſt is at Line 492:
<q>
                     <l>As when the fleecy Flocks un-number'd ſtand</l>
                     <l>In wealthy Folds, and wait the Milker's Hand,</l>
                     <l>The hollow Vales inceſſant Bleating fills,</l>
                     <l>The Lambs reply from all the neighb'ring Hills.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is at Line 516:
<q>
                     <l>As Torrents roll, increas'd by num'rous Rills,</l>
                     <l>With Rage impetuous down their echoing Hills,</l>
                     <l>Ruſh to the Vales, and, pour'd along the Plain,</l>
                     <l>Roar thro' a thouſand Channels to the Main;</l>
                     <l>The diſtant Shepherd trembling hears the Sound,</l>
                     <l>So mix both Hoſts, and ſo their Cries rebound.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0720200201:162"/>Theſe are two fine Compariſons, and at the ſame Time, are noble Deſcriptions. I the rather quote them to you, becauſe you might poſſibly paſs them over, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding them ſo much, as you never ſaw the Originals, of which theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions are a Picture; but if you had ſeen them, as I have often done (being born and bred up all my younger Days in a very mountainous Country) you would own that nothing can be more natural or beautiful.</p>
               <p>To underſtand the firſt Compariſon rightly, it is neceſſary to know that when the Lambs arrive at a certain Age, they are weaned, and put in a ſeparate Flock by themſelves. The Ewes are put in Folds to be milked. That reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0720200201:163"/>
Deſire which the Ewes and Lambs have to be together, makes them bleat inceſſantly, and, when within hearing, they regularly anſwer each other; thoſe Sounds the Hills-echo back, and fill the whole Valleys, or Glens (as we call them in <hi>Scotland)</hi> with a very agreeable Noiſe, even Muſick is ſcarcely more agreeable; at leaſt, to me.</p>
               <p>How exceedingly fine is the Deſcription of Diſcord, Line 503,
<q>Small at her Birth and riſing every Hour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<q>The Beginning of Strife is like the letting in of Water;</q>
for if we will make but a ſmall Paſſage for Water to enter at, it will itſelf enlarge it ſufficiently. We have this expreſſive Proverb in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <q>The Mother of Miſchief is no greater than a Midge's Wing,</q>
that is, a Gnat's Wing—intimating how ſmall a Circumſtance, how worthleſs and inconſiderable, may occaſion much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and great Miſchief.</p>

                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0720200201:165"/>The Moral, on the whole is, <hi>Avoid Strife as much as poſſible,</hi> and, as the Apoſtle ſays excellently,
<q>Seek Peace with all Men.</q>

               <p>I HAD a Letter from you by yeſterday's Poſt, which gave me great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0720200201:166"/>I ſhould now begin to explain to you the Nature of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid</hi>; but I do not know if you have yet made any Progreſs in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Treatiſe on Epick Poetry, by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Boſſu.</hi> If you have read, and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him attentively, I could omit many Things, as needleſs, and yet write a great deal more, that you would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and be pleaſed with. But this would not be proper, before you have read that compleat Treatiſe, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds the whole Art and Myſtery of the Epick Poem.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> I think, ſays, that the <hi>Iliad</hi> points out the Effects of Anger; the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> thoſe of Patience and Wiſdom. The Effects of Anger and Reſentment, are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0720200201:167"/>
raſh, mad, and fooliſh Actions, tending to Miſery and Deſtruction. The Effects of Patience and long Suffering are well-adviſed Actions, terminating in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of our Wiſhes and leading to Happineſs. <hi>Horace,</hi> who knew Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as well, perhaps, as any Man, who lived before or ſince his Time, (except ſome few whom we meet in the Holy Writings) ſays, that "He who violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſtens his Revenge, renders the very End he would attain, ineffectual." The <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſey</hi> are two great Examples of the Truth of this. In the former we ſee the Rage and Reſentment of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> fruſtrate the very Deſign, for which they came to <hi>Troy;</hi> to wit, the Deſtruction of the Town. What Miſeries did they not occaſion? What loſs of gallant Men? And <hi>Achilles,</hi> who
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0720200201:168"/>
even got the better in the Conteſt between him and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> paid dear for it in the Loſs of his beloved <hi>Patroclus.</hi> What though he had the Satifaction, or rather Triumph, of killing <hi>Hector,</hi> (a much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier Man than himſelf) yet that did not remove his Grief and Miſery; for, after that, we ſtill find him in the Agonies of Sorrow; ſo true is it, that even when our blind and mad Deſires are granted, we find ourſelves as far from Happineſs as we were before. Again, what did the Satisfaction of killing <hi>Hector</hi> coſt him? In the firſt Place, we ſee he was forced to forego the ſavage Pleaſure, he took in abuſing the Body of that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Chief; in ſpite of his Teeth, as we ſay, <hi>Jove</hi> compelled him to forego it. He was even obliged to do honour to the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0720200201:169"/>
Corpſe. Furthermore we find his own Fate was attached to that of <hi>Hector. Hector</hi> told him, at his Death, <q>the Gods would not let his Death paſs unreven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</q> 
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> accordingly met <hi>Achilles</hi> at the <hi>Scean</hi> Gate, and revenged it home; and, to his utter Diſgrace, made him fall at laſt by a far leſs worthy Hand than that of <hi>Hector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall take Notice of this Particular more at length, in ſome following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

the <hi>Iliad</hi> the Preference. I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what he ſays on that Head, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to his own Words; they are in the <hi>Dialogues des Morts.</hi>

                  <salute>My dear,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YEſterday's Poſt brought me yours of the 9th, in which your Hurry makes you leave out ſome Words, and miſplace others; this I wiſh you to guard againſt. It is a Neglect unworthy of you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0720200201:171"/>Before you proceed in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> I muſt beg you to read <hi>Boſſu,</hi> at leaſt ſome Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Beginning of his admirable Treatiſe. They will give you a proper Idea of the Nature and Plan of this, and every other Heroick Poem. There is alſo a ſhort Diſcourſe on Epick Poetry prefixed to the laſt Engliſh Tranſlation of <hi>Telemaque,</hi> which is well worth your Attention; though I cannot agree with the Writer in preferring <hi>Telemaque</hi> to <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not recommend theſe Books, in order to make you a nice Critick, but to enable you to read ſuch Works as the <hi>Iliad, Odyſſey, Aeneid, Paradiſe Loſt</hi> and <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> with greater Pleaſure and Profit. You may add to the Liſt, <hi>Toſſo</hi>'s <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0720200201:172"/>
which I have juſt finiſhed (a fine Poem indeed, and admirably tranſlated) and <hi>Ramſay</hi>'s <hi>Travels of Cyrus,</hi> about which we will talk when I come to Town.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other Works, ſome of which you have, that will be of great Service towards forming a true Idea of thoſe noble Authors, and likewiſe of all other kinds of Poetry; ſuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Art of Poetry, Roſcommon on Tranſlated Verſe, Horace, Vida,</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>'s <hi>Art of Poetry, Rapin</hi>'s and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier</hi>'s <hi>Diſcourſes on Eloquence and Poetry, Dryden</hi>'s and <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Diſcourſes, Pope</hi>'s <hi>Art of Criticiſm,</hi> the moſt excellent <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Cambray</hi>'s <hi>Diſcourſe on Eloquence,</hi> and the <hi>Spectators on Milton. Congreve</hi>'s <hi>Letter on Humour</hi> is alſo moſt excellent and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0720200201:173"/>
judicious, ſo are <hi>Dr. Trapp</hi>'s <hi>Diſcourſes on Virgil.</hi> Theſe Writings will give you a true Notion of Tragedy, Comedy, Satire, Paſtoral, Ode, Elegy, and Song, as well as of Epick Poetry; which laſt indeed, together with Tragedy and Comedy, are the three great Species of Poetry.</p>
               <p>I will now ſuppoſe that you have formed, or procured, a right Notion of the Nature of an Heroick Poem, and of the Action; that it muſt be one great, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, marvelous, but not incredible Piece; of a juſt Length, inſtructive and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; I will preſume likewiſe that you have a Notion of the Characters, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Sentiment and Diction, and of the ornamental Aid of Figures, Epiſodes, Deſcriptions, and Similes or Compariſons,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0720200201:174"/>
by which thoſe Characters and Manners are ſet off to Advantage.</p>
               <p>This being all pre-ſuppoſed, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what <hi>Homer</hi> propoſes to do in his two matchleſs Poems, and then examine the End and Tendency of that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>We will begin with the <hi>Iliad.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſays, that the Subject of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is the ſhorteſt, that ever was undertaken, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Anger of <hi>Achilles.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> if I am not miſtaken, ſays that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Propoſition or Subject, is far preferable to the former. The one is the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> the other is the Eſtabliſhment of a noble Empire, the nobleſt, perhaps, that the World ever ſaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0720200201:175"/>Now I cannot agree altogether either with <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Dryden;</hi> for, in the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is not the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered, that <hi>Homer</hi> propoſes for the Buſineſs of his Poem, but the Delays, Diſappointments, and Calamities, which attended the Greeks in Conſequence of the Anger and Reſentment of <hi>Achilles.</hi> This is the Plan which he lays down, and on which he promiſes to proceed; and the particular Moral, that naturally ariſes from it, is the moſt proper and uſeful that could be offered to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. The Grecians were compoſed of many little States; it was therefore their Intereſt to be unanimous, and cloſely united, when engaged in a common Cauſe. How apt then was his Moral! He wiſhed them to learn that their Safety
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0720200201:176"/>
conſiſted in their Union, and that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Diſſenſion would be their Ruin; this was in the Courſe of Time, actually verified. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> overthrew and enſlaved them; and the Means he purſued to bring it about, was firſt by ſowing Diſſenſion among them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding one State from the other. So divided, he found them an eaſy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The ſame Thing has happened a thouſand Times ſince, not only in ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign States and Kingdoms, but even in private Families. One of our Saviour's Tenets, is, <q>A Kingdom divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand;</q> and this is the grand Moral, which ariſes out of the particular Subject of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next Place, if we conſider the Tendency of the Poem, I do not ſee but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0720200201:177"/>
it may be deemed of as great Conſequence as that of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> though it may not be ſo ſpeciouſly agreeable. The Tendency of the one is to ſhew by what Means, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and worthy Qualities, a mighty Empire was founded: The Tendency of the other, to point out the Miſconduct, the Vices, and Follies, by which a great Undertaking was almoſt ruined (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had been entirely ſo, but for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Accident) and the whole Force of <hi>Greece</hi> overpowered. This laſt is ſurely as uſeful a Leſſon as the firſt; and ſtrictly juſtifiable in <hi>Homer,</hi> in-as-much as he propoſed to write another Poem, wherein he was to demonſtrate the great and good Effects of Virtue; for ſuch is the Purport of the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0720200201:178"/>I think it is Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> who ſays that, beſide the grand particular Moral, that ariſes out of an Epick Poem, or that which the Poet had chiefly in view, there are many others, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently reſult from the Fable. This is certainly true; it appears manifeſtly in <hi>Homer</hi>; and perhaps it was as much his Intention to ſhew theſe, as the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral above-mentioned. In my enſuing Letters I will occaſionally mark out ſome of theſe, and deſcribe what I conjecture to be the greatuniverſal Intention of the Author. At preſent, I fear I haved tired you, ſo ſhall trouble you no more for two or three Days.</p>

               <p>I HAVE ſome few Remarks to make in this Letter, on the Sixth Book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> but they are very few. <hi>Pope</hi> has given us ſo many fine Obſervations, that little is left for any other Pen. You have alſo contributed to leſſen what I might have had to ſay, by ſending ſome of your own, which I am much pleaſed with.</p>
               <p>The Speech, which <hi>Hector</hi> makes to his Mother, is admirable;

               <p>BY yeſterday's Poſt, I received yours of the 14th, but cannot much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Writing. I do not deſire you to write me, when you are in ſo very great a Hurry; rather put it off, till you have more Leiſure.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not trouble you with a long Letter of Particulars at preſent, but give you my Opinion of the <hi>Iliad</hi> in general.</p>
               <p>Beſide the great Moral thereof, there are many other Things which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Poem was meant to ſet forth.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0720200201:185"/>
We are ſhewn the ill Effects of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Love, vain Glory, Pride, Injuſtice, Breach of Faith, Diſſimulation, Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Inſtance, in <hi>Paris, Agamemnon, Aſius, Pandarus, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and many others. Hence as the <hi>particular</hi> Intent of this wonderful Poem, is to ſhew the fatal Conſequences of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion and Anger among Princes, ſo the main and general Deſign ſeems cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to point out the bad Effects of ungoverned Paſſions and Appetites in all Mankind; to ſet forth, that our giving way to them leads into Sin, that one Sin leads into another, and the whole into Miſery and Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The great Moral ariſing from it, is, (to give it you in the Greek)
<q>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0720200201:186"/>

                     </gap>.</q>
that is to ſay, "So the Counſel of the Gods was perfected, or fulfilled." This is the very Beginning of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has tranſlated it,
<q>Such was the ſov'reign Will, and ſuch the Deom of <hi>Jove.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Homer</hi> is much ſhorter, more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſublime; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>I was very well pleaſed the other Day when I found the above Sentence called, in <hi>Pope</hi>'s Notes, the <hi>grand Moral</hi> of the Poem; for, in Truth, though I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought ſo, I did not know that any one had ſaid it.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0720200201:188"/>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> ſhews us there is a neceſſary natural Connection between giving way to our inordinate Appetites and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tranſgreſſing our Duty to God and Man; and thence a conſequential Tendency to Miſery and Puniſhment. It is in this Senſe that one of the minor Prophets fays, "Is there Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?" teaching us thereby that no Miſchief or Evil befalls an impious City or People, but what happens by the wiſe Counſel and Will of God.</p>
               <p>There are two Ways, whereby the great Author of the <hi>Iliad</hi> ſhews us the Connection between Miſery and Sin, and between Sin and inordinate Affections. The one is, the natural Connection we

               <p>I Wrote you on Friday the 17th, and thought I might poſſibly hear from you on Sunday, but perhaps my Letter did not come Time enough to your Hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has obſerved, that, through the <hi>Iliad, Homer</hi> has, in a Manner, made every thing done by Divine Providence. Some Deity always aſſiſts the Hero who gets the better, except <hi>Ajax</hi> alone. When <hi>Hector</hi> breaks through the Grecian Wall, and ſets fire to their Ships, <hi>Jupiter</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts him. When he is killed, <hi>Jupiter</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0720200201:192"/>
has abandoned him, and <hi>Pallas</hi> aſſiſts <hi>Achilles.</hi> In a Word, in all Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in all Actions, where any Point is to be gained by Valour, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or Wiſdom, the ſupreme Power aſſiſts; in Defeat and Diſappointment, that Power deſerts them. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable ſtill to the holy Writings, where God is ſaid, "To put Wiſdom into the Heart, to ſtrengthen it;" and on the contrary, "To make blind, and to harden the Heart."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virgil</hi> has often ſaid, that ſuch and ſuch an Event came about by Chance, by the Viciſſitude of Fortune, and by the Inſtability of human Affairs. Perhaps he meant the ſame with <hi>Homer,</hi> (ſince he has often mentioned the Fates, or Decrees
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0720200201:193"/>
of the Gods in very expreſs Terms) though his Meaning is not ſo clearly pointed; but <hi>Homer</hi> is peculiarly ſtrict in his Expreſſions, for he always makes the Will or Counſel of the Supreme to be the Diſpoſer of every thing; by which we may learn what worthy Sentiments he had of the true God, and that all Things muſt be regulated by his wiſe Counſel, howſoever they may appear mere Chance to <hi>us,</hi> who, by reaſon of our human Blindneſs and Weakneſs, can neither foreſee nor avoid Thouſands of Events, that fall out every Day and every Hour.</p>
               <p>This, perhaps, you will reckon a Digreſſion, and it is ſo; but it opens

               <p>HOMER's Intention, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, is to ſhew us that inordinate Affections lead to Sin, and Sin to Miſery. He gives us a hundred
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0720200201:195"/>
Inſtances to prove this, but the chief is, <hi>The Wrath of Achilles</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The great Deſign and Tendency of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is repeatedly ſet forth and illuſtrated by Mr. <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; yet I cannot preſume it was through Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to what he had once ſaid; it was certainly his Intention ſo to do, in order to make a ſtrong and laſting Impreſſion on his Pupil's Mind.</note>.</p>
               <p>Beſide the Inſtances themſelves, the beautiful Order and natural Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he diſpoſes them, fully illuſtrate his Propoſition; and, from the whole Tenor of his Story, this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion naturally ariſes, that the Counſel and wiſe Diſpoſition of God is fulfilled in every thing. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has ſhewed this in his Notes on many particular Paſſages throughout the <hi>Iliad</hi>; but if we take a ſhort View of the Fable or Story,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0720200201:196"/>
we ſhall then ſee it in the cleareſt Light.</p>
               <p>Though the Author begins with the <hi>Wrath of Achilles,</hi> yet, in the Courſe of his Works, he takes care to ſhew us the Source of <hi>all</hi> the Miſeries which he has painted in his moſt admirable Poem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> was a Youth of royal Blood, beautiful and amorous; he ſung and played; he ſeduced from her Huſband the moſt beautiful Woman in the World, perhaps as amorous as himſelf. Her Huſband, who had hoſpitably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him, reſents this Uſage : he aſks the Aſſiſtance of his Friends, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States. They ſail to <hi>Troy,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0720200201:197"/>
the Country, and, at laſt, ſit down before the Town. The Daughter to the Prieſt of <hi>Apollo</hi> was made a Captive. Her Father goes to redeem her. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> refuſes his moſt juſt Suit, threatens and ill-treats him. The Prieſt complains to his God, who ſends Plagues firſt upon the Grecian Cattle, then upon the People. The Cauſes hereof are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; the Prophet is afraid of the King, but being aſſured of Protection from <hi>Achilles,</hi> proclaims aloud the Cauſe of the Diſpleaſure of Heaven. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> inſults him. Hereupon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enſues between <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> wherein they ill-treat each other. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> threatens to take <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Captive, <hi>Briſeis,</hi> from him, and actually does it; on which <hi>Achilles</hi> refuſes to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0720200201:198"/>
fight for the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The <hi>Trojans</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many Advantages by this Refuſal. A Duel is propoſed by <hi>Paris,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted on the Terms propoſed. <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> is treacherouſly wounded. The <hi>Trojans</hi> refuſe to reſtore <hi>Helen,</hi> or ſtand to the Terms agreed on; and though <hi>Priam</hi> was certainly of the ſame Opinion with <hi>Antenor,</hi> that ſhe ought to be given up, yet, through Indulgence to his Son, he ſubſcribes to a Breach of the Agreement. Hereupon Battle on Battle enſues. Both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> are miſerably deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and conſequently many Proofs are given of Courage, Wiſdom, Piety, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Patience, Friendſhip, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as alſo of Cowardice, Raſhneſs, Brutality, Vanity, Cruelty, and almoſt of all Virtues and Vices. The ſeveral
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0720200201:199"/>
Incidents are managed with great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Honourable Embaſſies are ſent to <hi>Achilles</hi> to return to the Service of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> He is inexorable till <hi>Hector</hi> kills his Friend. This gets the better of his Reſolutions; he returns to the Fight, from a Principle of Revenge, and kills <hi>Hector.</hi>

ſo naturally and orderly depending on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that each Part ſerves to ſtrengthen and illuſtrate the other; and the whole leads to a Demonſtration of the Author's firſt Propoſition, to wit, that the Wrath of <hi>Achilles</hi> occaſioned many and grievous Miſeries to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Hence we are taught, that Strife and Diſſention, as I have obſerved before, are the certain Ruin of any common Cauſe, State, Kingdom, or Family; that inordinate Affections lead to Vice; that Vice increaſes in its Courſe, inſomuch that one Sin, if I may be allowed the Expreſſion, begets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and conſequently, ſuch Perſons as give way to their Paſſions and Luſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gradually degenerate, fall from bad to worſe, till they are irrecoverably plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Guilt and Unhappineſs.</p>

                  <hi>Homer</hi> ſhews us alſo, that the Wrath of God hangs over the Head of the wicked, whether a Nation, King, or private Perſon. God ſends his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them, withdraws his Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, fights againſt them, ſends judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Blindneſs and Hardneſs of Heart upon them, and aſſiſts their Enemies to overthrow them; who, in executing the ſecret Will of Heaven, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſometimes, guilty of the ſame Crimes he made them the Inſtruments to puniſh, and are, in their Turn, chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, he ſhews how much good Men, engaged in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Cauſe, are favoured by Heaven. The Way to obtain this Favour he points

               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0720200201:203"/>I told you in my laſt except one, that <hi>Homer</hi>'s Purpoſe in his <hi>Iliad</hi> is to ſhew us that inordinate, ungoverned, unreſtrained Paſſions and Appetites are the Means of leading us into Sin, and conſequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Miſery; and that the Order and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of the Story helps to ſet this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the ſtrongeſt Light. I gave you likewiſe a ſhort Sketch or Argument of the <hi>Iliad.</hi> Now let me comment a little on it, and we ſhall thereby not only ſee <hi>Homer</hi>'s great and accurate Judgment, but diſcover ſome very valuable Truths, on which if we will well obſerve, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, happy will it be for him or her who does it.</p>
               <p>The Source of all this Miſchief, the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and of the whole
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0720200201:204"/>
royal Race of that Kingdom, of infinite Woes and Miſeries to their Allies, as well as to the Grecians, was <hi>an unlawful Amour.</hi> The Cauſe which <hi>Homer</hi> aſſigns, to wit, <hi>The Wrath of Achilles againſt Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> is but an intervening, not the original Cauſe. <hi>The Seduction of Helen,</hi> and Breach of Hoſpitality, in carrying her off during her Huſband's Abſence, that Huſband who had entertained the Seducer kindly, who was a Perſon too of ſuch Diſtinction, no leſs than a King, theſe, I ſay, were the original Source of all thoſe Woes and Devaſtations.</p>
               <p>Here we cannot but admire the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Excellency of his Fable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0720200201:205"/>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> was a King's Son, <hi>Helen</hi> a Queen, two of the handſomeſt Perſons in the known World. <hi>Homer</hi> would teach us herein that handſome Men and Women are ſubject to much greater Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this kind, than others. Such a Man has great Advantages over the fair Sex, and ſuch Women are more liable to Flattery, and the Danger of having their Morals ſpoiled by falſe Suggeſtions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing Men; who never fail, when they meet with a Woman of Virtue, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reaſon her out of it, before they can hope for Succeſs. Not half ſo much Pains is ordinarily taken on Women who are but homely; and we ſee daily that more fine Women are ruined, than others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> choſe for his Purpoſe two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch exalted Condition, ſo highly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0720200201:206"/>
bred, alike poſſeſſed of ſome Virtues, and yet made the Crime very black for the following Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Had they been Perſons of mean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or abandoned Principles, they would not have made ſo deep an Impreſſion on our Minds; nor ſhould we have had that Care or Concern, at leaſt, not that Pity for them, which, in the preſent Caſe, we feel every now and then, to return upon us.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Paris</hi> had been a downright Ruffian, and <hi>Helen</hi> a low diſſolute Wretch, they could not have been of any Uſe to the Poet then, or to us now. What can be learned from two People quite ſunk in Debauchery? But theſe, though bad enough, had yet great Remorſes; at leaſt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0720200201:207"/>
                  <hi>Helen</hi>; and <hi>Paris</hi> was not a Ruffian, though he was a Seducer. Now where ſome good Qualities are mixed with bad, where Virtue and Sin ſtruggle together, and ſometimes Honour, ſometimes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Frailty, gets the better, the Poet can ſhew Human-kind as it is, and place it in a very inſtructive Light; otherwiſe, he cannot.</p>
               <p>It was abſolutely neceſſary to make the Crime very provoking, and the Perſon injured of a very diſtinguiſhed Character, elſe the Poet could not, with any due Probability, have brought all <hi>Greece</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Arms, to revenge the Injury. Had <hi>Helen</hi> been a Perſon of mean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Kings and Princes would not have leagued together to reſent her Huſband's
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0720200201:208"/>
Wrongs; had the Injury been ſlight, it could not have borne a Quarrel; nor could <hi>Homer</hi> have vindicated his Greeks, whom he is ſo fond of, nor the Gods themſelves, had he built his beautiful Poem on a ſlight Event. Again, if <hi>Paris</hi> had been of low Extraction, whom could the Greeks fight againſt? Not <hi>Troy</hi>—for the whole State and their Allies could not have engaged in the Defence of one who was leſs then a King's Son. In the one Caſe, <hi>Homer</hi> could not have had his Greeks to fight, in the other, he could nor have had the Trojans to fight againſt. On the whole, therefore, I hope you will agree with me, that the Bard was moſt judicious in chuſing two Perſons of great Diſtinction, of great Beauty, and guilty of a great Crime, to be the Originals,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0720200201:209"/>

               <p>I Have the Pleaſure of yours of the 22d, and am very glad to hear you are in good Health. I preſume both your Aunt and Mother are well, ſince you mention nothing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>It would be very agreeable to me that you write of the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi> Your laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on <hi>Homer</hi> was of the 14th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>; ſo that Correſpondence has been

long ſuſpended. In my next I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume my Obſervations on the <hi>Iliad</hi>; but ſhall now contract them as much as poſſible, there being many Things in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Remarks, which anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate what I ſhould otherwiſe have obſerved.</p>
               <p>I did indeed expect a longer Letter from you, at leaſt two or three ſhort ones—a Method that I ſhall purſue hereafter. Nothing damps the Spirit, wherewith a Correſpondence ſhould be kept alive, ſo much as neglecting to write a little, becauſe you have not Leiſure for a great deal. Remember this Maxim, and purſue it.</p>

               <p>PUrſuant to my Promiſe of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I ſit down to give you only a ſhort Letter. I now return to <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have you read over my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obſervations on this Subject, when you peruſe this Letter. In the tenth Year of the War between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we have ſeen the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſit down
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0720200201:212"/>
before <hi>Troy. Homer</hi>'s Poem begins here, and the Circumſtance wherewith he opens it, is the Diſſention which happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles.</hi> This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Difference had almoſt ruined the <hi>Greeks.</hi> It aroſe, you remember, from <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Refuſal to accept Ranſom for the Prieſt of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Daughter, only becauſe he loved her better than his own Wife. He affronts the Prieſt, abuſes and threatens the Augur <hi>Calchas,</hi> calling him a falſe Interpreter of the Will of Heaven. Hereupon a Quarrel ariſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and <hi>Achilles.</hi> They inſult and defy each other, till, in the End, <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> takes from him his Captive Briſeis.</p>
               <p>What we have to remark on this Event is well worth Notice: we ſee <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>

fall into the very Crime which he came to revenge. How highly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural! There is nothing more common in ordinary Life, than to ſtumble into the ſame Faults and Errors, for which we condemn others. How blind and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial are we to ourſelves!

               <p>THOSE human Frailties I was upon in my laſt, Partiality to ourſelves and Uncharitableneſs to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are the Cauſes of more than half the Miſchief that happens in the World. Hence it was, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually preached the Non-Reſentment and Forgiveneſs of Offences. Nothing can ſo much contribute to the Peace of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. To return to <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee this inordinate Affection in <hi>Agamemnon</hi> betrayed him into Paſſion, Rudeneſs, and Injuſtice; and theſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0720200201:215"/>
brought on Miſery. What Inſults did he not undergo? What ſtinging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches did he not endure? To what Grief, Shame, and Repentance, was he not expoſed? In what Calamities did he not involve his Army? How was he conſtrained to court and ſue to <hi>Achilles?</hi> And how were his Supplications reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his Proffers ſcorned? Here is a natural Connection between his Crime, and the ſad Effects of it.</p>
               <p>Obſerve likewiſe, his Crime was not only puniſhed in its own Conſequences, but by the abſolute Interpoſition of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Plague is ſent upon the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and Burials are heaped on Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials. This is exactly conformable to what our holy Religion teaches; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that one Sin naturally draws on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0720200201:216"/>
and that the End and Wages of Sin, are Death or Miſery. Beſide this inherent Puniſhment, God ſometimes ſends immediate Vengeance. Being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially merciful, he begins with milder Judgments; but upon Obſtinacy and Impenitence he pours forth the Fullneſs of his Wrath. In <hi>Pope</hi>'s Notes, you ſee the Conformity of the Procedure in this Plague, to that inflicted on <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> fell into a Crime of the ſame Nature with that of <hi>Paris,</hi> but not near ſo heinous in Degree: the Puniſhments therefore were only proportionable, <hi>Troy</hi> was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed, for the atrocious Crime of that People, and their obſtinate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in it. The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſuffered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0720200201:217"/>
but were not deſtroyed; for-as-much as their Crime, or Perſeverance therein, was not ſo flagrant.</p>
               <p>We gather alſo from this excellent Poem, that People are oft involved in the Vices and Puniſhments of their Princes. A wicked King is not only a Plague in himſelf to his Subjects, but, in his Sins, he calls down Judgments upon them. This is confirmed in the Scriptures, as well as in <hi>Homer.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the 2d Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> Chap. xxiv. we read,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Surely at the Commandment of the <hi>Lord</hi> came this upon <hi>Judah,</hi> to remove them out of his Sight, for the Sins of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> according to all that he did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0720200201:218"/>And alſo for the innocent Blood that he ſhed, (for he filled <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with innocent Blood) which the <hi>Lord</hi> would not pardon.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The holy Writings teach us that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are puniſhed for the Faults of their Parents. <hi>Homer</hi> ſhews us the ſame.</p>
               <p>We often ſee Children unaccountably (as far as Appearance goes) involved in the Faults of their Parents, and ſuffering on their Account; it appears ſtrange, at firſt, but on due Reflection, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there is nothing more natural, in the common Courſe of Things, than that the Sins of a Parent ſhould fall heavy on a Child. There is ſuch a Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them, the one is ſo much a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0720200201:219"/>
Part of the other, that this Conſequence can hardly be avoided; at leaſt, in many Inſtances.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures teach us, that <hi>God</hi> makes one People the Inſtrument of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on another, and again contrary-wiſe. <q>
                     <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall deſtroy <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh Ephraim</hi>;</q> and it is ſaid to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>You ſhall be a Scourge and a Plague to the Heathen that are about you, and they ſhall be a Scourge to you.</q>
               <p>Nothing can be more natural or more juſt, with reſpect to two guilty Nations. <hi>Homer</hi> enforces the ſame; the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> are both guilty, but not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0720200201:220"/>
equally; they are both puniſhed, but not equally; only in Proportion to the Size and Aggravation of their Crimes, and they were made reciprocally the Means of each other's Puniſhment. Through the whole Bible, particularly in the Prophets, and more eſpecially in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> this Doctrine is ſtrongly inculcated.</p>
               <p>How amazingly great then is <hi>Homer!</hi> We find a Heathen, through the Strength and Juſtneſs of his own Conceptions and Sentiments, agree almoſt in every Point with "the Word of God." And by the Tenor of the whole, his <hi>grande Morale</hi> is fully evinced; namely,</p>

               <p>I'LL let <hi>Homer</hi> ſtand ſtill a while, and give you a ſhort Deſcription of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Road from <hi>London,</hi> we come firſt within Sight of the City, at about two Miles Diſtance, on the Top of a pretty high Hill, called <hi>Shoot-over-Hill.</hi> Here we have a View of the River, with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0720200201:222"/>
the plain Country embanking it, and on either Hand a Range of Hills. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver below <hi>Oxford</hi> is called the <hi>Thames,</hi> but at <hi>Oxford</hi> there are two Rivers, that on the Weſt is called the <hi>Iſis,</hi> that on Eaſt the <hi>Cherwell.</hi> The one comes from the North, the other, to wit, <hi>Iſis,</hi> from the North Weſt. They meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which ſtands in the Point between them, on a little riſing Ground, ſurrounded with Rivers and Meadows on the Eaſt, Weſt, and South, and with fine Corn Fields on the North. Beyond thoſe Meadows and Rivers are two Tracts of pretty high Hills, covered with Paſture, Corn, and Woods intermixed. When you come within View of the Town from <hi>Shoot-over-Hill,</hi> it ſtrikes you very agreeably with a great Number of public Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0720200201:223"/>
ſuch as Churches, Colleges, Schools, the Theatre, Printing-Houſe, Dr. <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe</hi>'s Library, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſt as you enter <hi>Oxford</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> you croſs the <hi>Cherwell</hi> by a Bridge, thence aſcend gradually to the Middle of the Town; then you deſcend as gradually, till you come to the <hi>Iſis,</hi> over which you paſs by ſeveral Bridges. The many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, into which theſe two Rivers have been cut, have been the Occaſion of ſo many Bridges about <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their private Buildings are but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; but the great Number of public Buildings, the Squares, Avenues of Trees, the Gardens, Groves, fine Walks, and beautiful Country around, make it a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0720200201:224"/>
moſt delightful Place in Summer. The Streets, for the chief Part, are clean and dry.</p>
               <p>This Deſcription, though but faint, is enough to give you a Sort of Taſte of the Beauties of <hi>Oxford.</hi> If you wiſh to be more particularly informed, let me know, and I will do the beſt I can to ſatisfy you. I ſubjoin a Sort of Sketch or Plan of <hi>Oxford</hi>

I ſhould have told you that the two Rivers are very unlike each other; the <hi>Cherwell</hi> is deep, flow and muddy, with many Turnings and Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Banks overgrown, conſequently
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0720200201:225"/>
the Water not eaſily to be come at in many Places. The <hi>Iſis</hi> has a ſtrait Courſe, runs pretty ſwift, the Water clear, the Bottom gravelly and firm, and the Banks ſmooth, clean, and diſengaged from Woods or Shrubs.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0720200201:226"/>The <hi>Univerſity</hi> here is one of the moſt famous in the World: it is a Place for Education in all the liberal Sciences. For this Purpoſe, there are no leſs than ſeventy Colleges, and five or ſix Halls, where Inſtructors in theſe reſpective Branches reſide; namely, for Divinity, Logic, Phyſic, Anatomy, Aſtronomy, Law, Rhetoric, and Languages. Each of theſe Colleges is a Building by itſelf, and many of them are very ſtately. Each is likewiſe a ſeparate Society by itſelf, governed by its own Laws and Cuſtoms, under its own particular Charter; and the whole, incorporated into one great Body, is called the <hi>Univerſity.</hi> Hence they derive great Privileges. The City of <hi>Oxford</hi> is ſubject to them: they ſend Members to Parliament; and every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0720200201:227"/>
has a particular Founder, as a King, Queen, or other diſtinguiſhed Perſonage.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have built and firſt ſettled Endowments on Colleges, are called the Founders; thoſe who have left Sums of Money, Lands, or Books, ſince their Foundation, are ſtiled Benefactors.</p>
               <p>The Halls were originally Buildings belonging to ſome particular Colleges, though ſeparated from them, and were erected for the Conveniency of lodging Students, when the Colleges were too much crowded; or for the Reception of the Sons of great Men, who did not like to be confined to ſtrict College-Hours. But now Things are altered.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0720200201:228"/>
Some of the Halls have been turned into Colleges, and others are wholly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of them.</p>
               <p>You deſire, perhaps, to know the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe Buildings.</p>
               <p>A College is a Body corporate within themſelves, who have a Charter of their own, and can buy and ſell, take and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy by Gift or Legacy, in their own Name. The Charter is a Grant from the King.</p>
               <p>A Hall has one Head or Chief, in the ſame Manner as a College, and, like that, is alſo a Part of the Univerſity. It has its own Rules, Orders, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but no Charter, conſequently is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0720200201:229"/>
not a Body Corporate within itſelf. The Society poſſeſs no Lands nor Rents, nor can they take and enjoy, like a College, in their own Name. When any thing is given or bequeathed for their Uſe, they cannot hold it themſelves, but muſt lodge it in the Univerſity for their Uſe.</p>
               <p>There are many good Schools in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but not an Univerſity. The Reaſon is plain. <hi>London</hi> is a Place of great Hurry and Buſineſs, full of Temptations and Avocations. <hi>Oxford</hi> is a retired Place, ſurrounded with Gardens, Woods, Groves, Hills, Meadows, and Rivers.

               <p>I TOOK Notice to you formerly, that not alone the fine Moral, and the great and important Subject of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poem was to be admired, but alſo his judicious Manner of conducting it, and the Beauty of the whole Contexture of his Fable or Story; whence it is not only pleaſant as well as profitable, but from being pleaſant, it makes a deeper Impreſſion on our Memories, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect it with continual Satisfaction<note n="*" place="bottom">The Writer ſeems admirably to have adopted this agreeable Precept in his own Practice. He catches hold of every Opportunity to throw in that Simplicity and Playfulneſs, which make Inſtruction moſt engaging. A Tribute of this Kind is paid to the Memory of Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> in an elegant Latin Inſcription, in the Cloiſter of <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey.</hi> The Monument is ſaid to be erected by the Scholar of that Foundation. From this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription I have taken my Motto for this Work, the Turn of it being ſo immediately adapted to our Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Diſpoſition. May I be forgiven, if I here ſubjoin the whole, and preſume to add an humble Imitation of it in Engliſh, which I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to attempt, merely from the Delight I have taken in the Original? <q>

                  <hi>Homer</hi> has made uſe of wonderful Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems for this Purpoſe. The Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Ships, the Names of the Commanders, the geographical Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral Countries they came from; the characteriſtic Diſtinction of the Leaders; the nice Plot contrived to give us an Idea even of the Make and Shape of their Perſons, in bringing <hi>Helen</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0720200201:233"/>
to deſcribe them to old <hi>Priam</hi>; the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Menelaus</hi> firſt, then of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> in ſingle Battle; the manifeſt Advantage he gives to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus,</hi> and a ſort of Advantage to <hi>Ajax,</hi> though not great; the <hi>Trojans</hi> breaking
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0720200201:234"/>
the Truce, wounding <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to reſtore <hi>Helen</hi>—All theſe ſerve to vindicate the Greeks, and aſcribe Blame to the Trojans.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that, though ſeveral of the Grecian Heroes have, now and then, the Advantage over <hi>Hector,</hi> yet he, in his Turn, has the Advantage over every one of them. This is, that the Poet may give the greater Honour to <hi>Achilles,</hi> who is the only Man deſigned at laſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Hector</hi>; and not even then without the Aſſiſtance of a Deity, nor till Heaven had abandoned <hi>Hector.</hi> We ſee too that <hi>Hector,</hi> though the beſt Man among all the Heroes, either Greek or Trojan, and the Man whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> loves for his Piety and other Virtues, was yet involved
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0720200201:235"/>
in the common Calamity. He fought, 'tis true, from Love to his Country and Family, but he fought on the wrong Side. How agreeable this to the holy Scripture! There we find national Sins draw down Judgments on ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons as are, no Matter by what Means, involved therein.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of good old <hi>Priam</hi> ſeems to be the ſame with that of good old <hi>Eli.</hi> Though <hi>Priam</hi> approved not of his Son <hi>Paris</hi>'s Crime, yet he was indulgent to him, and did not compel him to do Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Herein his Default was parallel to that of <hi>Eli,</hi> of whom the Lord ſays to <hi>Samuel,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>I will judge his Houſe for ever, for the Iniquity which he knoweth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0720200201:236"/>
his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not. <bibl>

               </q>
               <p>It is worth your while to read this whole Chapter and that preceding it.</p>
               <p>In Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Notes you will read the ſeveral Inſtances of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the whole Conduct of his Story, ſo I need not repeat them. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only two.</p>
               <p>You know it is a Proof of great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a Poet, to ſuit every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with Propriety, and to make his Perſonages act in Character. There is an Inſtance of the former, when <hi>Homer,</hi> to relieve us from the Fury of a Battle,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0720200201:237"/>
brings in his Heroes in a ſort of Parley, as that between <hi>Glaucus</hi> and <hi>Diomede,</hi> to which I refer you. Another Inſtance is in his fit Diſpoſal of Time, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has obſerved, in that buſy Night, which preceded <hi>Hector</hi>'s breaking in upon the Grecian Intrenchments.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate his Perſons acting up to Character, conſider the Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Neſtor</hi> is in, when the Embaſſy is ſent to <hi>Achilles.</hi> You know the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors were <hi>Ulyſſes, Phoenix,</hi> and <hi>Ajax.</hi> Obſerve their different Characters, their different Modes of Behaviour; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Impreſſions their Speeches made on <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the different Treatment he gave them. Again, obſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Demeanour of the Grecian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0720200201:238"/>
on that melancholy Night, when (as the Poet expreſſes it)
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Hector</hi>'s Approach in ev'ry Wind they hear,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Hector</hi>'s Fury ev'ry Moment fear.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>All this is worthy to be remarked with the utmoſt Care. It is admirably fine, and proves to what a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <hi>Homer</hi> has kept up to what the Critics call MORES, the MANNERS.</p>

                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0720200201:239"/>You ſee, through the whole <hi>Iliad,</hi> that the Gods always refuſed the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications of wicked Men, eſpecially thoſe who continued in their wicked Courſes. I need not quote Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amples. We ſee the ſame verified in many Paſſages of the Scripture, and it is confirmed by no leſs an Author than <hi>Our Saviour.</hi>

                  <p>The great Moral of the <hi>Iliad</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ſad Experience of After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and one would almoſt think that <hi>Homer</hi> had foreſeen for <hi>Philip</hi> of

                     <hi>Macedon,</hi> as well as the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Romans, after taking Advantage of the Diſſenſions that aroſe among the Greeks, or of thoſe they ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, themſelves fell a Prey to other Nations at laſt; and this will certainly happen to be the Caſe of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> one Time or other, unleſs they continue to be more wiſe and virtuous than any States ever were, united in the ſame Manner as they <hi>are.</hi>
                  </p>

               </opener>
               <p>I DARE ſay you are beginning to be weary of <hi>Homer,</hi> as well as you love him, and of the many Obſervations we have made, therefore we will drop him after this and my next Letter—at leaſt for ſome Time, and find another Subject for our epiſtolary Converſation.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time, pleaſe to obſerve that when <hi>Achilles</hi> was reconciled to <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> it was not either that his Anger was abated, or that the Love of his Country or his Countrymen got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0720200201:243"/>
of it, but another Piece of Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Deſire of Revenge got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the former, as it was incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the other. And this new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of his was ſtill more furious than the firſt, and much more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; for certainly <hi>Hector</hi> was in the right to kill <hi>Patroclus</hi>; and though <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> might lament the Death of his Friend, yet there was no Reaſon for his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing ſuch a brutal Paſſion againſt a fair Enemy.</p>
               <p>You will find this very agreeable to the Accounts we have in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Diſpenſations of God, who makes every thing, even the Sins and Follies of People, contribute to advance and bring about the Completion of his
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0720200201:244"/>
ſacred Purpoſes and Will. It ſtill ſerves too to illuſtrate his <hi>grande Morale,</hi> which he never loſes Sight of,
<q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Jews, when they cried out againſt our Saviour, <hi>Crucify him, crucify him,</hi> little dreamed that they were forwarding the Salvation of Mankind; nor had <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> any ſuch Deſign when he betrayed him; neither did the High Prieſt know the grand Import of his own Words, when he ſaid, <q>It was expedient for one Man to die for the People.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Providence puniſhed the Greeks by the Fierceneſs of <hi>Achilles</hi>; and by that very Fierceneſs ſaved them, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to them. Many are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0720200201:245"/>
of this Kind in the ſacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>David</hi> ſays,</p>
               <q>The Wrath of Man ſhall turn to thy Praiſe, and the Reſidue thereof thou ſhalt reſtrain.</q>
               <p>Another Thing very well worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and which is ſtill a great Proof and Illuſtration of the Truth of the above Moral, is this: <hi>Homer</hi> never brings any great Event to bear, any fortunate Act to be performed, or noble Virtue exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, without the Aſſiſtance of a divine Power. When his Heroes fail, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Gods</hi> have forſaken them. Do they ſucceed? It is becauſe the <hi>Gods</hi> are with them. Do they act prudently? The <hi>Gods</hi> inſpire them. Do they act fooliſhly?
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0720200201:246"/>
The <hi>Gods</hi> blind them. But then it is as obſervable, that this is the Reſult of their own Conduct and Principles. There is a Something in their Minds which renders them either dear or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable to the Deities. This is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the whole Tenour of the Old Teſtament, as you may read in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Inſtances of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael, Juda, Syria,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, you ſee the Means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Favour of the Supreme was, next to a virtuous Life, beſpeaking him by Prayer. This is the Practice of all <hi>Homer</hi>'s great Men; and the Succeſs of their Undertakings was always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Sacrifices of Praiſe and Thankſgiving. This was underſtood to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0720200201:247"/>
be an indiſpenſable Return of Duty and Gratitude to the Gods. When <hi>Hector</hi> eſcapes ſafe from <hi>Diomede,</hi> the latter cries out,
<q>
                     <l>Once more thank <hi>Phoebus</hi> for thy forfeit Breath,</l>
                     <l>Well by <hi>Apollo</hi> are thy Pray'rs repaid.</l>
                  </q>
And <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſays, in more Places than one, when ſpeaking in <hi>Hector</hi>'s Favour, <q>That he had offered many Sacrifices to the Deities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus as theſe Heroes imputed the Eſcape of their Enemies to ſome God, ſo when they expreſſed their Hopes of getting the better of them, they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently accuſtomed to ſay, <q>If ſuch or ſuch a God aſſiſt me.</q> Herein they conformed to the Phraſe in Scripture; <q>They did not put their Truſt in their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0720200201:248"/>
own Swords or Bows.</q> 
                  <hi>Virgil</hi> has given us an Inſtance of an Hero, 'tis true, who did put his Truſt in his own Strength. I mean <hi>Mezentius.</hi> 
                  <q>My own right Hand (ſays he) is my God, and the Dart I am going to throw.</q> But <hi>Virgil</hi> took Care beforehand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him a moſt impious Wretch, and a Tyrant, and makes his End ſuitable to his bad Character.</p>
               <p>Now, my dear, fearing I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently tired you, I will add no more, but that I am</p>

               <p>THIS ſubſequent Letter may more properly be ſtiled a Poſtſcript to to the foregoing; wherein I forgot to obſerve to you, that when the Purpoſe of Heaven was fulfilled by the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Achilles</hi> againſt <hi>Hector,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was checked in his Career before the half of his Reſentment was ſatisfied. He had doomed the Body of <hi>Hector</hi> to be without Burial and funeral Honours; to be left a Prey to Dogs and Vultures; but <hi>Jove</hi> and the other Gods would not permit that. <hi>Hector</hi> was dear to them on Account of his Piety. <hi>Jove</hi> would
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0720200201:250"/>
have him buried honourably, and <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was obliged to let go his Hold. Herein the Reſidue of his Wrath was reſtrained, Heaven having no further Uſe for it; and herein alſo is verified another Paſſage in Scripture,</p>

                  <salute>My dear,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I SAID, in a former Letter, that I had done with <hi>Homer,</hi> but I find I have not.</p>
               <p>In order to make his Morals, or the Application of his Doctrine, reliſh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he has beautifully diverſified his Story. He has introduced many Epiſodes that are very delightful: for Example, that which <hi>Glaucus</hi> tells to <hi>Diomede,</hi> that which <hi>Phoenix</hi> tells to <hi>Achilles,</hi> that which <hi>Neſtor</hi> relates, and many others. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve too, they are always told in a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0720200201:252"/>
proper Place, and always recommend ſome Virtue, or arraign ſome Vice.</p>
               <p>Many of his Epiſodes and other Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have alſo the ſame Tendency with the great Deſign; that is to ſay, to ſhew the ill Effects of Diviſion, Reſentment, and obſtinate Revenge, particularly that of <hi>Phoenix</hi> to <hi>Achilles</hi>; or to ſhew us that inordinate Luſts, Affections, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, lead to Sin and Miſery; or to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the <hi>grande Morale,</hi> 
                  <q>That God's Will muſt be accompliſhed, and his Counſel muſt ſtand.</q> And by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually mixing theſe Stories in his Work, he calls up our Attention to the great Purpoſe of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides this great Purpoſe, he gives us occaſional Precepts; Inſtances of what
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0720200201:253"/>
is fit, decent, prudent, and of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. He ſets before our Eyes many beautiful and uſeful Things in Nature, as of the Heavens, the Earth, rural Labours, Winter, Summer, Harveſt, Rocks, Mountains, Rivers, Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as likewiſe of artificial Things, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of War, Peace, Commerce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I refer you to what Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has ſaid hereon.</p>
               <p>The laſt Thing that I ſhall deſire you to obſerve, is this. Though the main Deſign of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is to ſhew us that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery flows from Sin, and Sin from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Appetites, yet he therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with many Inſtances of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Succeſs flowing from doing our Duty; and contrary-wiſe in the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0720200201:254"/>
though the main Tendency of that Poem be to ſhew that Happineſs ſlows from a Diſcharge of our Duty to God and Man, (which is the Conſequence of ſubduing our Paſſions) yet he mixes, in the Courſe of his Story, frequent Inſtances of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ariſing out of Sin.</p>
               <p>To conclude—I fancy to myſelf that I ſee <hi>Homer,</hi> like a moſt renowned old Philoſopher, or one of the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, preaching to his Countrymen in this Manner—"Learn, O my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that all Unhappineſs proceeds from Sin, and Sin proceeds from inordinate Affections. Learn that all Happineſs proceeds from Virtue, and Virtue from hearkening to the Dictates of Reaſon; that in the one Caſe God will aſſiſt you,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0720200201:255"/>
in the other, deſert you. To obtain his Aſſiſtance, you muſt depend on him; you muſt aſcribe all to him that you do well; you muſt apply to him by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer; and not that alone, but you muſt leave Vice and embrace Virtue, otherwiſe God will not hearken to you, though you make many Prayers; and when he bleſſes and aſſiſts you, you muſt render him the Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving."</p>
               <p>"To confirm the firſt of theſe my Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, I will tell you a Story of the Wrath of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the Quarrel that happened between him and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> ſupreme Leader of the Grecians, at the Siege of Troy; which, beſides confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my firſt Doctrine, will plainly prove
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0720200201:256"/>
that Diviſions and Diſſenſions among People united in a common Cauſe and Intereſt, though they may conſiſt of many little independent States and Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, muſt probably be the Ruin of them all. This may be the Caſe of Greece; and you may be ſwallowed up by ſome great Prince or other, if Diviſions be raiſed and encouraged among you."</p>
               <p>"To prove my ſecond Doctrine, to wit, that bridling your Paſſions, acting with Patience, Prudence, and Piety, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently having God to favour you, will lead you to Succeſs through the greateſt Difficulties, I will tell you a Story of the Travels of <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> And from both you may derive this important Truth; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that every thing whatſoever is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0720200201:257"/>
diſpoſed, governed, conducted, and eſtabliſhed, by the all-wiſe, all-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and immutably-certain Will of God, and muſt be brought to the Period that he has ſet and determined."</p>
               <p>If you have <hi>Creech's Horace</hi> at Hand, read the ſecond Epiſtle of his firſt Book of Epiſtles. It is inſcribed to <hi>Lollius.</hi> You will ſee there in what View he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders theſe two Poems.</p>

There are many more. Some you have ever at Hand. If you would now and then read the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes,</hi> the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi>'s Dialogues, Fables, and Lives of the Philoſophers, they could not miſs to furniſh you with Abundance of Reflections, equally proper for Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Converſation; and this they would do without its being neceſſary that you ſhould comment on every Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage you read there, or write down every Reflection that preſents itſelf; only ſuch
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0720200201:261"/>
as moſt ſtrongly and naturally affect you.</p>
               <p>I am pleaſed with your Obſervations on many of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Beauties. I have gone through the Author, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined them. Theſe added to thoſe of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> who has been ſo copiouſly excellent, leave very little for me to ſay; but I will oblige you wherever I can. Nothing has occurred to me till now, with the 9th Book open before me. It would be endleſs to point out every Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage I think excellent; I ſhall only confine myſelf to ſuch as I fancy will admit ſome particular Remark or Illuſtration.</p>
               <p>The Complaint againſt <hi>Jove,</hi> at Line 25, is what Mankind in general is too
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0720200201:262"/>
guilty of. We lay to the Charge of God what is our own Fault. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſeems to have been exactly in this Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he ſays, "Why art thou to me as a Lyar? <hi>&amp;c."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At Verſe 47, <hi>Diomede</hi> ſays to <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi>

               <p>He recollects the Reproach caſt on him in a former Book, though at that Time he made no Reply to it. Hence we learn <hi>to take Care what we ſay</hi>; for though we may fancy an Expreſſion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, it may return, and be of bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when we leaſt expect it.</p>

               <p>NEptune's Progreſs to aſſiſt the Greeks, in Book the Thirteenth, is admirably deſcribed; and Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has ſhewn us the Affinity between that and a Paſſage in the ſixty-eighth Pſalm, but there are many other Places in the holy Writings wherewith it may be compared. It would be endleſs to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate them: they will occur to you in your Peruſal of that ſacred Volume, which is abſurdly given as a Taſk-Book

to Children indiſcriminately of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, when it is an Exerciſe for the moſt adult and experienced Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<note n="*" place="bottom">What Mr. Preſton ſays here is ſurely no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to his having recommended the <hi>Bible</hi> to his Pupil, though ſo early as at 10 Years of Age. Be it obſerved that, by his excellent Inſtructions, ſhe had then read other Authors, and was more than capable of digeſting what he propoſed, namely, the <hi>Proverbs, Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>If I may be excuſed for ſaying it, I think there are ſome few Faults in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Tranſlation and Notes in theſe two Books. In Book xiii. Verſe 890,

<q>Ill-fated Paris, Slave to Womankind, &amp;c.</q>
is not accompanied with his uſual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Hector</hi> indeed is bold and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient—ſo far he may reſemble <hi>Achilles,</hi> but he is neither violent nor unjuſt.

               <p>I HAVE now re-peruſed the 15th and 16th Books of the <hi>Iliad.</hi> Your own Obſervations on theſe are remarkably good; therefore I have very little to ſay.</p>
               <p>In Verſe 86. Book xv. the Swiftneſs of a God Compared to that of the Thought of Man, is inimitably beautiful. Mr.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0720200201:268"/>
                  <hi>Pope</hi> has juſtly remarked it, but a much inferior Genius could not have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked it.</p>
               <p>In Verſe 428, we find <hi>Neſtor</hi> placing the Confidence of his Prayer in his Piety towards the Gods, which confirms one of <hi>Homer</hi>'s great moral Rules, and which I have touched upon in a former Letter.</p>
               <p>Book xvi. Verſe 9. This Simile is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſtriking. Literally rendered from the Greek it would run thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>No Child that runs after its Mother, and holds her faſt by the Robe, and hinders her from proceeding, and looks up in her Face, weeping to make her take it in her Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0720200201:269"/>
You cannot imagine how beautiful it is in the Original.</p>
               <p>In Verſe 40. <hi>Homer</hi> now makes the ſame Implication in the Perſon of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus,</hi> that he did formerly in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Phoenix</hi>; namely, the Obſtinacy of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the ill Conſequences thereof. This is an Epitome of the whole Scope of the Poem, which, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> remarks, <hi>Homer</hi> every now and then introduces, to fix our Attention to his great Deſign.</p>
               <p>In my preceding Letter I endeavoured to diſtinguiſh the Diſpoſition of <hi>Hector</hi> from that of <hi>Achilles.</hi> In Verſe 122. we have a ſtrong Inſtance of the ſavage Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the latter. How unlike the pious <hi>Hector!</hi>

                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0720200201:271"/>The Conflict at Verſe 418. Book xvii. about the Body of <hi>Patroclus</hi> is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fine. How naturally is it compared to Fires, that riſe and ſink by Turns! <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems fond of the Image him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for he repeats it in Book xviii. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole Struggle, from the Time <hi>Patroclus</hi> was killed, till <hi>Achilles</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is moſt admirably deſcribed.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This Picture of <hi>Achilles</hi> is moſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fine. But here I will preſume to ſay we may prove Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> to have been wrong in his Remark on a former Book, where he avers, "It was Jealouſy of his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0720200201:272"/>
Honour, that made <hi>Achilles</hi> lay his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on <hi>Patroclus</hi> not to fight with <hi>Hector.</hi>" We ſee here that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately imagines him to have been ſlain; whence it appears more probable, that his warning him to ſhun <hi>Hector</hi>'s Force, was from Apprehenſion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, not Jealouſy of the Motive.</p>
               <p>Verſe 547. Here are four admirable Lines. The Deſcription of the Shield is admirable throughout. What Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf has ſaid about it, and what he has quoted from others, will, in great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, give you a true Taſte of Sculpture and Painting, and deſerves to be read often.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE now gone through another Book of <hi>Homer,</hi> and made the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remarks.</p>
               <p>Book xix. Verſe 57. <hi>Achilles</hi> confirms the Obſervation I formerly made; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was not the Love of his Country, but a new Reſentment, that incited him; and though he preaches here againſt Reſentment and obſtinate Fury, yet it is obſtinate Fury which here poſſeſſes him, and actually makes him preach againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0720200201:274"/>Verſe 81. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in his Speech confirms your Obſervation, laying the Blame of his Folly on Fate, and the Gods, and thinks thereby to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Imputation. I think the Story he tells here, though to the Purpoſe, might have been ſpared. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves very juſtly, that <hi>Homer</hi> always regards due Decorum. He makes <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> riſe, but <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſit ſtill.</p>
               <p>Verfe 281. Here <hi>Achilles</hi> imputes the Blame of his own Folly to <hi>Jove,</hi> as <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> did before; and herein, as in other Inſtances, it may be ſaid that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> means to remind us of the great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his Poem; for he tells us, it was the high Will of <hi>Jove</hi> that doomed their Strife, and doomed the Greeks to fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0720200201:275"/>Book xx. Verſe 335. I think what <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Halicarnaſſus</hi> has ſaid in this Note is very reaſonable, and as ſtrong as any thing Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has ſaid againſt it. How the Fact really was is hard to know at this Diſtance of Time.</p>
               <p>I ſhalt finiſh what I have to ſay on the <hi>Iliad</hi> in two more Letters, I believe, and hope to conclude this Week.</p>

               <p>AT the Beginning of Book the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-firſt, the Deſcription of the Flood endeavouring to drown <hi>Achilles</hi> is the Produce of a vaſt Imagination. The Compariſon at Verſe 14, is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is alſo the Conflagration, and the Effect it had on the Fiſhes.</p>
               <p>But, with Submiſſion, I think all the Scuffle between <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi> Verſe 558, very ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Verfe 608. This Compariſon, and the Note upon it, proves, what I have often
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0720200201:277"/>
obſerved, a Conformity between <hi>Homer</hi> and our Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Book xxii. Verſe 221. A further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation how dear are pious Men to God.</p>
               <p>Verſe 278. Read the Notes here. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Euſtathius</hi> overacts the Defence of <hi>Homer</hi> in this Place<note n="*" place="bottom">The Note here entirely belongs to <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius; Pope</hi> is not actually, only negatively, involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, merely by not having contradicted what was aſſerted by the other.</note>. They explain the ſupernatural Aſſiſtances which <hi>Achilles</hi> receives, into Allegory; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the like, when ſhewn to <hi>Hector,</hi> to be real, merely to favour, or rather to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize the Valour of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0720200201:278"/>Verſe 628. Here is ſurely one of the moſt beautiful Paſſages in the whole <hi>Iliad</hi>; and what <hi>Andromache</hi> obſerves and complains of, we find verified to this Day. It ever has, and will be ſo.</p>
               <p>The Lamentations of <hi>Priam, Hecuba,</hi> and <hi>Andromache,</hi> in this Book, and thoſe of <hi>Hecuba, Helen,</hi> and <hi>Andromache,</hi> in the laſt, are all different; they ariſe from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Motives, and each Perſon utters what immediately belongs to his or her Character and Circumſtances; a further Proof how judiciouſly <hi>Homer</hi> has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the <hi>Manners</hi> throughout his Poem. It is again evinced in Book xxiii. Verſe 41. The Behaviour of <hi>Achilles</hi> in this Place how very conſiſtent! The Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Ghoſt of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and all that paſſes, is extremely fine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0720200201:279"/>In the Detail of Prizes given to the Racers, at the funeral Games, obſerve the following Lines;
<q>
                     <l>A Woman for the firſt, in Beauty's Bloom,</l>
                     <l>Skill'd in the Needle and the lab'ring Loom.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Do they not imply, with many other Paſſages in this Poem, that Women, how beautiful ſoever, are not prized, without ſome uſeful and laudable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification?</p>
               <p>Verſe 369. Here we have a beautiful Picture of an old Man inſtructing his Son how to win the Prize; and we alſo diſcern with what an extenſive Genius <hi>Homer</hi> was bleſſed; for the Rules that <hi>Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> gave, being univerſally uſeful, are as much in Force now as they were then.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0720200201:280"/>The Obſervation on Line 817, by Madame <hi>Dacier,</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi>'s ſubjoined Sneer, are, in my Opinion, equally non-ſenſical.</p>
               <p>The Note on Verſe 973, beginning at theſe Words, <q>But alſo his Deſign might be to compliment the Greeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> is by no Means juſt, and even contradicts what the Author has often ſaid of <hi>Ajax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To return to the very firſt Note on this Book, I cannot concur with Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Opinion in Defence of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Conduct, in carrying on his Work for two Books after the Death of <hi>Hector.</hi> He urges that <hi>Homer</hi>'s Undertaking was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and as that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0720200201:281"/>
Anger did not die with <hi>Hector,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted even his Remains, ſo the Poet ſtill keeps up to his Subject. But Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> with Deference I ſpeak it, is miſtaken; it is not ſimply the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that is <hi>Homer</hi>'s Subject, but that particular Anger and Reſentment which was ſo deſtructive to <hi>Greece,</hi> and took Birth from his Diſſenſion with <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon.</hi> This Subject, after the Death of <hi>Hector,</hi> is entirely exhauſted, and the Revenge then purſued is of a different Nature from the <hi>Wrath</hi> which <hi>Homer</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſing; for inſtead of being deſtructive, it then becomes advantageous to the Greeks.</p>
               <p>In my next I ſhall give you my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Reaſons which induced the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0720200201:282"/>
Author to protract his Work beyond the Death of <hi>Hector.</hi> I thought to have done it here, and ſo have finiſhed this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Letters, but the Aſſizes are now held in this City. Some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from London engage my Time, and an Acount I have juſt received of the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Death unnerves my Spirits.</p>

               <p>I HAVE now read the <hi>Iliad</hi> to an End, and have but few Remarks to make on the two laſt Books.</p>
               <p>Book xxiii. Verſe 41.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The huge Ox bellowing falls; with feebler Cries</l>
                  <l>Expires the Goat; the Sheep in Silence dies.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Theſe two Lines are a juſt Picture of the Nature of the reſpective Animals. How characteriſtically affecting is the laſt to a tender Mind!</p>
               <p>Ver. 120. Here are eight fine Lines, and they ſhew us what was the Creed at that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0720200201:284"/>
Time. The laſt, I think, much exceeds the Original.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Notes eſcaped me when I wrote laſt, as many other Things do; and indeed Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Excellence in Criticiſm has left very little in the Power of any ſucceeding Commentator. I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom repeat to you what he has ſaid, unleſs I think it ſo remarkable as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your peculiar Attention.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to the twenty-fourth Book, and ſhall conſequently very ſoon put an End to this Subject, which has entertained us ſo long.</p>
               <p>Verſe 5. This Deſcription of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Lamentation is admirable, though the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0720200201:285"/>
Lines 17 and 18, are not, in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo full and ſo expreſſive as in the Original, which is as follows, if literally rendered:</p>
               <q>Sometimes he lay on his Side, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he turned quickly on his Back, then he lay prone on his Face, and then he ſtood ſtrait up on his Feet.</q>
               <p>Verſe 291. This is an exceeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Picture of a Perſon, particularly one in Years, overwhelmed with Grief. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Note is moſt judicious, and well worthy Attention. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common than for a Parent, in the firſt Tranſports of Affliction, to prefer a Child that is dead, to all who remain alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0720200201:286"/>I have done now with particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; and though we have dwelt on this Subject ſo long, I yet feel a Deſire to communicate my general Sentiments, I mean my Opinion of <hi>Homer</hi>'s continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Poem beyond the Reconciliation of <hi>Achilles</hi> with <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> Perhaps I may not expreſs myſelf ſo well as to be underſtood, or my Arguments may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too ſubtle; not ſolid enough. Be that as it may, I ſhall expect an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Account of your Senſe of them, and what your Sentiments really and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly are on the ſame Point.</p>

               <p>IN theſe my general Sentiments on our great Bard, I muſt be very frank, and the rather to induce you to be ſo in your Anſwer. I profeſs myſelf of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinion from Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſons which induced <hi>Homer</hi> to carry on his Work beyond the Death of <hi>Hector.</hi> I am apt to think the true Reaſon was, that the Poet had many more beautiful Things to ſay, which he was unwilling ſhould be loſt; and truly I am glad they were not. But then the Queſtion is, whether he has done
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0720200201:288"/>
judiciouſly in protracting the Work, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to cloſe it with the Death of <hi>Hector,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> has finiſhed the <hi>Aeneid</hi> with that of <hi>Turnus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To form a right Judgment hereon, we ſhould conſider the Subjects of the reſpective Poems; that is, what thoſe two great Poets propoſed by them.</p>
               <p>The Subject of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements as well as Sufferings of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> till he brought about a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a new Kingdom, for himſelf, his Family, and the People in <hi>Italy.</hi> To the Accompliſhment of all this there was no Obſtruction but the Rivalſhip of <hi>Turnus</hi>; conſequently, on his Death, all
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0720200201:289"/>
is compleated. There was no need to carry the Work further; though one <hi>Maſshoeus</hi> has added a thirteenth Book, wherein <hi>Aeneas</hi> is married to <hi>Lavinia.</hi> But this is ſuperfluous. The great Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being removed, the Poet leaves us to imagine all the reſt. What he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was entirely fulfilled; to wit, all the Sufferings his Hero had to undergo with Seas and Winds, with Men and Gods, and all the croſs Accidents he had to wreſtle with, and bravely ſubdue by his Patience or Exploits. But it is not ſo in the <hi>Iliad.</hi> The Poet there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to ſing the fatal <hi>Conſequences</hi> of the Reſentment of <hi>Achilles.</hi> It was therefore very juſtifiable in him to carry on his Work beyond the Time that Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laſted. If it ought to have ended
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0720200201:290"/>
with that, there was no Need to make him kill <hi>Hector</hi>; for that Event fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Period of his Reſentment to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> which is the Ground-work of his Poem. But the Poet certainly deſigned to ſhew not only the ſad Diſaſters that befel the <hi>Greeks</hi> through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of <hi>Achilles,</hi> but to give ſtill a ſtronger Impreſſion of the bad Effects of Diſſenſion among Chiefs, as well as other Perſons, whoſe Intereſts are united. He paints the great Change of the Grecian Affairs for the better, on his Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Leader of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Ships are ſaved, <hi>Hector</hi> is killed, the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans are repulſed, and driven within their Town. What follows, namely, the dragging the Coarſe of <hi>Hector</hi> round <hi>Troy,</hi> the Grief and Behaviour of <hi>Achilles</hi> on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0720200201:291"/>
the Loſs of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> the Inſtitution of the <hi>Games</hi> at his Funeral, all this is in order to compleat the Character of his Hero; to ſhew us his Virtues as well as his Vices. He makes him an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Perſon both Ways; and yet of vaſt, nay of abſolute Importance to the ſucceſsful Iſſue of the War. He has probably given him this mixed Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a Leſſon how Princes and Rulers ought to manage Perſons of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who have ſtrong Qualities, both good and bad; ſo that they may turn the former to their Advantage, and, by a cautionary Prudence, divert any bad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from the latter.</p>
               <p>To point out the Importance of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> ſtill ſtronger, it was neceſſary to ſet
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0720200201:292"/>
forth that of <hi>Hector.</hi> Though this is done throughout the whole Work, while <hi>Hector</hi> lived, it is not ſufficient. The Poet does not ſtop there. The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Death, the Lamentations of his Father, Mother, Wife, Siſter, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and the whole People, the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and indeed <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>'s own Speech, after he had killed him, render him ſtill more important, than all that had been ſaid or deſcribed of him before.</p>
               <p>Add hereunto the Approbation in which he was held by <hi>Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury,</hi> and almoſt all the Gods; their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Achilles</hi> on his Account; their compelling the Body to be delivered up to honourable Burial, and <hi>Achilles</hi> himſelf lifting it on the Bier.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0720200201:293"/>I am apt to think that Piety, which <hi>Homer</hi> has all along recommended, was the great Leſſon he propoſed to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, by this laſt Book. The Praiſes of <hi>Hector</hi> for his Piety occur ſo thick, and the Concern of the Gods for his Death is ſo ſtrongly painted, that one would be tempted to believe <hi>Hector</hi> was as much his Hero as <hi>Achilles,</hi> only of another Kind; and though the Poet condemns the Cauſe he was concerned in, and makes him ſuffer for it, yet he ſeems to be more in Love with him, than with his profeſſed Hero. He does ample Juſtice to his Virtues, and ſeems to make him, much rather than <hi>Achilles,</hi> a Pattern for Imitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0720200201:294"/>Remember you are to ſend me your free Opinion on all I have ſaid. I don't deſire you to write very long Letters. Write two or three ſhort ones at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Times, and then put them all under one Cover.</p>

read the two Plays you deſired me, <hi>Sir Fopling Flutter</hi> and <hi>Sir Courtly Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Man of Mode,</hi> or <hi>Sir Fopling Flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> was firſt written. The Author was a high-bred Gentleman; his Characters are well drawn; the Dialogue is eaſy, natural, and genteel; there is a great deal of Wit and good Senſe in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation among the principal Characters, eſpecially between <hi>Dorimant</hi> and <hi>Loveit,</hi> and between the ſame Gentleman and <hi>Harriet. Old Bellair</hi> is very entertaining; he is good-natured, pleaſant, open, and ſincere: in a Word, he is a downright Country Gentleman, of the beſt Sort.</p>
               <p>If I miſtake not, the <hi>Spectator,</hi> long ago, cenſured this Play, as being built
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0720200201:296"/>
on a wrong Foundation; for, ſays he, "the End of it is to promote Vice." <hi>Dorimant,</hi> his fine Gentleman, is a Wit, well bred, of excellent Senſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely engaging, but totally devoid of Faith and Honour. <hi>Harriet,</hi> the fine Lady, is perpetually deſpiſing her Mother. The Scene of the Orange-Woman and drunken Shoemaker is too groſs, and ought not to have been brought into ſuch polite Company. A Lady of good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a fine young Heireſs, lodging in an Orange-Woman's Houſe, is, I think, wrong judged; and <hi>Dorimant</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his Intention of marrying <hi>Harriet</hi> was to repair his Fortune, is, in my Opinion, out of Character; unleſs that, as a Rake, he thought Shame to own that he was really in Love; but,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0720200201:297"/>
ſurely, even that is driving the Rake too far for <hi>Dorimant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spectator,</hi> after having remarked ſome Paſſages in this Comedy, adds, <q>This whole celebrated Piece is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contradiction to good Manners, good Senſe, and common Honeſty. Nothing but being loſt to a Senſe of Innocence and Virtue can make any one ſee it, without obſerving more frequent Occaſion to move Sorrow and Indignation, than Mirth and Laughter.</q> He had great Reaſon indeed for what he ſaid. The Sufferance of ſuch immoral Pieces perverts the true Intent of the Stage, which was meant to be a Place of inſtructive Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not empty Diſſipation. That Mr.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0720200201:298"/>
                  <hi>Addiſon</hi> conſidered it in this Light, is evident, from the two Pieces he gave to the Theatre, <hi>Cato,</hi> and the <hi>Drummer.</hi> The Growth of licentious Pieces is principally, if not altogether, to be aſcribed to the vitiated Taſte of an Audience. The vulgar Expreſſion, <q>If there were no Receivers, there would be no Knaves,</q> may be here not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly alluded to: <q>If there were no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers of immoral Pieces, none ſuch would be repreſented.</q> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but the Regulator of a Theatre would rather deſire to ſee it a Seat of Decorum, than of Licentiouſneſs, or that an Actor would be better pleaſed to utter Sentiments of Truth and Virtue, than thoſe of Vice and Immorality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0720200201:299"/>The other Play, <hi>Sir Courtly Nice,</hi> ſeems to be an Imitation of <hi>The Man of Mode,</hi> though a faint one. Notwithſtanding there are ſome good Things in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet the Characters are not by far ſo genteel, nor is there ſo much Wit or good Senſe in the Dialogue, as in the latter. <hi>Farewel</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Dorimant,</hi> only not vicious. <hi>The Aunt</hi> is a Copy of <hi>Lady Woodvill,</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> of <hi>Harriet.</hi> The Contraſt between <hi>Hothead</hi> and <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> is diverting, but I cannot think they are naturally brought in. <hi>Sir Courtly Nice</hi> is well drawn, but not ſo delightful a Fop as <hi>Sir Fopling</hi>; nor do I think his Foppery ſavours ſo much of the "Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman." I do not know what to make of <hi>Lord Belguard.</hi> I think him in the main a ſilly Fellow, though perhaps
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0720200201:300"/>
with ſome Smattering of good Senſe and Breeding. <hi>Hothead</hi>'s Behaviour to him is quite <hi>outrée, Crack</hi>'s Character appears overdone, and the unravelling of the Plot not entirely natural. <hi>Surly</hi> altogether is too groſs, though ſome Part of what he he ſays is entertaining enough. There are certainly many worſe Plays. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Tendency of this Piece being rather good than otherwiſe, gives it, in my Opinion, one material Aſcendancy over <hi>The Man of Mode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps what I have ſaid may engage you to read them over again, and then I ſhall be glad to have your Opinion of them.</p>

               <p>I Received a Letter from you juſt as I had finiſhed my laſt, and ſince that I have received yours of the 8th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>I am exceedingly pleaſed with your Obſervations on the <hi>Odyſſey</hi>; I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that you have not made more, and have gone ſo quickly through it. In a late Letter I reminded you of ſome Books which I had mentioned formerly, ſuch as the Bible and Apochrypha, <hi>Rochefau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault,</hi> &amp;c. where you might find very good Subjects for our Converſation.</p>

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0720200201:302"/>I have begun to read the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> but ſhall only, at this Time, take notice of the Obſervation you make on the Anſwer <hi>Telemachus</hi> gives to <hi>Mentes</hi> about the Doubtfulneſs of his Legitimacy. <hi>Pope</hi> ſays, <q>Whatever Truth there may be in the Reply, there is very little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in it.</q> I muſt own myſelf of a different Opinion; I think <hi>Telemachus</hi> rather means a Compliment, than a Reflection on his Mother. The Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Author, in my Conception, amounts to this. <hi>The Certainty of our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy depends on the Word and Honeſty of our Mothers. Penelope avows me to be her Son by Ulyſſes; and conſidering the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Character of my Mother, there is no Doubt to be made of my being ſo; her Avowal of it amounts to abſolute Proof.</hi>

               <p>I Have read over the third and fourth Books of the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Advice which <hi>Mentor,</hi> or rather <hi>Pallas</hi> in his Shape, gives to <hi>Telemachus,</hi> at the Opening of the third Book, is moſt admirably prudent and juſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0720200201:309"/>Verſe 62 and 63, are very poetical and inſtructive, to all Degrees of Life.</p>
               <p>Verſe 282. Notwithſtanding what Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſays here about the Force of Deſtiny, I think no other Defence can be made for <hi>Telemachus,</hi> than his Youth, and that Impatience which naturally ariſes from a long Endurance of Afflictions. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>Pallas,</hi> which is moſt admirable, certainly points it out.</p>
               <p>Verſe 333. What a charming Inſtance have we here of the Power of good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when delivered in a pleaſing amiable Way! Poetry and Muſic, united with divine or moral Precepts, conſpire to keep the Mind from giving way to Temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0720200201:310"/>Verſe 429. Beſides that this is a very judicious Obſervation in the Poet, for the Reaſons which Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> aſſigns in his Note, it includes an excellent moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to Mankind.</p>
               <p>Verſe 496 to 515. What an admirable Picture is given us of <hi>Neſtor</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily!</p>
               <p>Book iv. Verſe 437. I cannot but think it ſomewhat indecent in <hi>Telemachus</hi> to ſtile his Father <hi>the Man</hi>; but perhaps this is the Fault of the Tranſlator. I have not the Original by me at preſent to determine it.</p>
               <p>The Stanza at Line 475, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I have often remarked
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0720200201:311"/>
to be one great Point through the whole Work; and at Verſe 635, we ſee it again.</p>
               <p>Book v. I agree with you that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more beautiful than the Grotto of <hi>Calypſo,</hi> and the Environs; but Verſe 177, I think, is a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; the frequent Repetition of the Word <hi>HE,</hi> without a Diſtinction, ſeems to make it ſo. It runs,
<q>Go then he may; he muſt, if HE ordain;</q>
would it not have been better thus,
<q>Go then he may; he muſt, if JOVE ordain;</q>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay I am cavilling at Words, but I <hi>feel</hi> the Objection ſtrongly. I think too that calling <hi>Ulyſſes the Man,</hi> Verſe 186, is not ſo well;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0720200201:312"/>
would not <hi>the Prince,</hi> or <hi>the Chief,</hi> have done better?
<q>
                     <bibl>Ver. <hi>294.</hi>
                     </bibl>
Ulyſſes rob'd him in the Cloack and Veſt,</q>
appears to me not particular enough.
There is ſomething too inconſequential
for the Hero.</p>
               <p>Verſe. 311. Notwithſtanding all that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has ſaid in Defence of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> being able to compleat his Boat in four Days Time, from the Deſcription of it, I think it is hardly probable.</p>
               <p>The Critics have been very ſevere on theſe Words, "the well-fought Wall," Verſe 395.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0720200201:313"/>You ſee, my Obſervations on this Book are rather employed in finding Faults, than diſcovering Excellencies; and I really think Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has made more Eſcapes herein, than in any I have read yet.</p>
               <p>The Note upon Verſe 454. is very fine, and merits particular Notice.</p>
               <p>Book VI. is charming throughout. It gives us a delightful Picture of the Good-nature, Hoſpitality, paternal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and Simplicity of the Manners of the Antients. Verſe 247 and 248, perfectly agree wich the holy Pſalmiſt, where He ſays, "Whoſo giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord." Pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Verſe 100. and read the Note

               <p>I thought, my Dear, I ſhould have been able to get through a Book or Two more; for I find what is in the Notes, and what you have obſerved will cut my Work very ſhort; but your Letter is juſt come to Hand, which I have read with vaſt Pleaſure; only I think you go too faſt through <hi>Rochefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault.</hi> I hope to have another from you ſoon on that Subject.</p>

            <p>This little Tract has been in great Eſtimation for theſe Fifty Years paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has gone thro' many Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Ireland. The Remedies it preſcribes are ſimple, and eaſily obtained, and never fail of a Cure, where the Diſorder is curable; and no Man who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues his Horſe, ſhould preſume to travel without it.</p>
            <p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p>
            <p>It may not be unneceſſary to acquaint the Reader, that theſe Preſcriptions have not been haſtily jumbled together, but are experimentally efficacious. A great many Books have been written on Farriery, of which <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s is undoubtedly the beſt, but his Rules are too tedious for the Pocket. Such a Book therefore as this, is neceſſary on a journey, in order to refer to, as Occaſion requires, and it contains as much as is known by any of our common Farriers.</p>
            <p>As ſmall as this Tract may appear, it will be found to inform Gentlemen, Firſt, What Methods are beſt to be uſed, if their Horſes fall lame. Secondly, What Medicines are proper to give them when ſick. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, How to direct the Operations, and eſcape the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ignorant Men. In ſhort, by the Help of this Treatiſe, Gentlemen will be able to prevent a Groom or Farrier from injuring their Horſes, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Applications, and miſtaking one Diſtemper for another.</p>
            <p>The Receipts are few, naked and cheap: the Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice but one, and contrived on purpoſe to prevent
<pb facs="tcp:0720200201:319"/>
Trouble, and ſave Time and Charges, by pointing out the beſt Remedies at firſt, ſuch as are eaſieſt to be got, and ſuch as make the ſpeedieſt Cures; and the Reader may be aſſured they have been experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by a Practice of thirty Years. The Book is drawn up in a Manner calculated for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Pocket, ſuppoſing him upon a Journey; and no Man, who values his Horſe ſhould travel without it.</p>

            <q>The Public is here preſented with a new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of that fine old Romance BARCLAY's AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENIS. The Original has been well known to the Learned theſe 150 Years; and for the Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mere Engliſh Readers, two Verſions of it, in our Language, were given in the Courſe of the laſt Century; but the Style of theſe is grown too obſolete for the preſent Age.</q>
            <q>The Editor as ſhe chuſes to ſtyle herſelf, rather than Tranſlator, has prefixed to the Work, a very judicious Account of the Author's Deſign, and of the Merit of his Performance: which is, as ſhe well obſerves, A Romance, an Allegory, and a Syſtem of Politics, Conſidered as an Inveſtigation of the various forms of Government, and of the moſt proper remedies for the political Diſtempers of a State, it will certainly be thought a Work of great Merit, if we make due allowance for the time in which it was written. But if regarded only as a Work of moral Entertainment, it will be allowed to ſtand in the foremoſt Rank of the old Romances, ſacred to Chivalry and Virtue. In Brief, to uſe the Words of the ingenious Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,—Barclay's Argenis affords ſuch Variety of Entertainment, that every kind of Reader may find in it ſomething ſuitable to his own Taſte and Diſpoſition: the Stateſman, the Philoſopher, the Soldier, the Lover, the Citizen, the Friend of

               </gap>ork (of which there are many) that undertake to give an Account of New Books. As theſe Opinions will be ranged under each other, Gentlemen will thus be better able to judge of the Merit of any Piece, than by a ſight of a few ill-choſen Extracts, ſelected by one prejudiced or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Reviewer. Beſides, as the Authors of this Work do not intend to confine themſelves to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number of Pages, no Publication of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Month will be omitted; an Advantage the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic has not hitherto experienced, as Books have not been reviewed till ſome Months after they have been out.</p>
            <p>To render this Work further Uſeful as well to the Trade as to every Man of Reading, Eight Pages of Letter-Preſs will be regularly added, by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, that may be Bound up ſeparately; giving a ſhort Account of every Volume that has hitherto been publiſhed, the various Editions through which it has gone, the Improvements that have been made, the Sizes of thoſe Editions, the Prices, the Authors Names, as far as they are known, the Years in which they were publiſhed, and the Names of the Publiſhers, and whether they are in Print or out of Print; a Work whoſe univerſal Utility muſt be ſelf-evident. At the End of each Year, the Books will be alphabetically

ranged by way of Index, and an alphabetical Table will be given of Authors Names, referring back to all the Pieces they have ever written.</p>
            <p>Note, Each Number will contain near 200 Articles being double the Number comprehended in any other Publication of double the Price.</p>

            <p>Containing alſo a ſhort Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of National Freedom, from the Invaſion of Julius Caeſar to the preſent Times.</p>
            <q>This is a very uſeful Publication, particularly at the preſent Period, when the Nature of our Conſtitution is ſo much the Subject of Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. The Author, together with the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Charter, has given an Engliſh Tranſlation for the Benefit of his unlearned Readers, and a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Account of the manner in which this ſacred Palladium of Engliſh Liberty was originally obtained from King John. He compleats the Whole, with an Eſſay on Parliaments from their Origin in England, and their half-yearly Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, to their Septennial Duration, and diſplays no leſs an extenſive Fund of Knowledge, than a laudable Exactneſs in the courſe of his Relation.</q>
