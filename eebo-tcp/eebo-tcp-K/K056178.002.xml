            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O EMILY! How inconſiſtent is a heart in love! I entreated Mr. Mandeville not to write to me, and am chagrined at his too exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: I think if he loved as I do, he could not ſo eaſily obey me. He writes to Lady Anne, and though by my deſire,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0276901102:4"/>
I am aſhamed of my weakneſs—But I wiſh he wrote leſsoften: there is an air of gaiety in his letters which offends me—He talks of balls, of parties with ladies—Perhaps I am unjuſt, but the delicacy of my love is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his knowing a moment's pleaſure in my abſence; to me all places are equal where he is not; all amuſements without him are dull and taſteleſs. Have not I an equal right to expect, Emily! He knows not how I love him.</p>
            <p>Convinced that this mutual paſſion is the deſignation of heaven to reſtore him to that affluence he loſt by the partiality of an anceſtor, and the generous loyalty of his family, I give way to it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; I regard my love as a virtue; I am proud of having diſtinguiſhed his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without thoſe trappings of wealth, which alone can attract common eyes. His idea is for ever before me; I think with tranſport of thoſe enchanting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—Emily,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0276901102:5"/>
that week of tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is all my life, the reſt is not worth numbering in my exiſtence.</p>
            <p>My father to-night gives a ball to Lord Melvin, with whom I am again, unwillingly, obliged to dance. I wiſh not to dance at all; to make this ſacrifice to the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of men: Why have I not courage to avow my ſentiments, to declare he alone—This Lord Melvin too, I know not why, but I never ſee him without horror.</p>
            <p>O Emily! How do all men ſink on the compariſon? He ſeems of a ſuperior rank of beings. Your Julia will never give her hand to another; ſhe ſwears this to the dear boſom of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>This deteſted Lord Melvin is at the door; he will not let me proceed; he tells me it is to a lover I am writing; he ſays
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0276901102:6"/>
this in a manner, and with a tone of voice—he looks at me with an earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—Lady Anne has alarmed me—Should my father intend—yet why ſhould I fear the moſt cruel of all acts of tyranny from the moſt tender and indulgent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents!</p>
            <p>I feel a dejection of ſpirits on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which does injury to my father's goodneſs: perhaps it is no more than the natural effects of abſence on a tender and unexperienced heart.</p>
            <p>Adieu! I am forced to finiſh my letter. All good angels guard and preſerve my Emily!</p>

            <head>To the Earl of BELMONT.</head>
            <p>WITH all my affection for Lord T— I am hourly ſhocked by that moſt unworthy of all faults, his haughtineſs to inferior fortune, however diſtinguiſhed by virtue, talents, or even the more ſhining advantage of birth. Dreſs, equipage, and the over-bearing aſſurance which wealth inſpires, ſtrike him ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that there is no room in his ſoul for that eſteem which is a debt to modeſt merit.</p>
            <p>We had yeſterday to dine Mr. Herbert, one of the moſt amiable men I ever ſaw; his perſon was genteel, his countenance at once expreſſive of genius and worth, which were rendered more touching to me, by that penſive look and irreſolute air, which are the conſtant attendants on an adverſe fortune. Lord T— returned his bow
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0276901102:8"/>
almoſt without looking at him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued talking familiarly to a wretch with whom no gentleman would converſe, were he not maſter of ſix thouſand a year: the whole company, inſtructed in his ſituation by the ſupercilious air of the maſter of the houſe, treated him with the ſame neglect, which I endeavoured to conſole him for by every little civility in my power, and by confining my attention intirely to him; when we parted, he aſked me to his houſe with a look full of ſenſibility; an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſhall take the firſt opportunity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting.</p>
            <p>When the company were gone, I aſked Lord T— the character of this ſtranger. Why, really, ſays he, I believe he is in himſelf the moſt eſtimable man in my neighbourhood; of a good family too; but one muſt meaſure one's reception of people by the countenance the world ſhews them; and he is too poor to be greatly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0276901102:9"/>
there. Beſides I am not fond of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with unhappy people, they are very apt to aſk favours.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, ſaid I, my Lord, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him haſtily, you can avow ſentiments like theſe? Why are you raiſed by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence above others? Why entruſted with that wealth and conſequence which might make you a guardian angel to the unhappy? Where is my chaiſe? I will return to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, where affliction ever finds a ready audience; where adverſity is ſure of being heard, though pomp and equipage wait.</p>
            <p>Lord T— ſmiled at my earneſtneſs, and praiſed the generoſity of my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he aſſured me were his at my age: he owned he had been to blame; but in the world, ſaid he, Harry, we are carried away by the torrent, and act wrong every moment mechanically meerly by ſeeing others do the ſame. However I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0276901102:10"/>
ſtand corrected, and you ſhall have no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reaſon to complain of me.</p>
            <p>He ſpoke this with an air of good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which reconciled us, and has promiſed to accompany me in my viſit to Mr. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, which I have inſiſted ſhall be the firſt we pay, and that he ſhall beg his pardon for the behaviour of yeſterday.</p>
            <p>Is it not ſtrange, my Lord, that men whoſe hearts are not bad, can avoid thoſe whoſe characters do honor to their ſpecies, only becauſe fortune denies them thoſe outward diſtinctions which wealth can give to the loweſt and moſt deſpicable of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
            <p>Surely of all human vices, Pride is the moſt deteſtable!</p>

            <head>TO HENRY MANDEVILLE, Eſquire.</head>
            <p>CAN I play with the anxiety of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart? Certainly, or I ſhould not be what I am, a coquet of the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Setting aſide the pleaſure of the thing, and I know few pleaſanter amuſements, Policy dictates this conduct; for there is no poſſibility of keeping any of you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out throwing the charms of dear variety into one's treatment of you: nothing cloys like continual ſweets; a little acid is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>I am juſt come from giving Lady Julia ſome excellent advice on the ſubject of her paſſion for you. Really, my dear, ſaid I, you are extremely abſurd to bluſh and look fooliſh about loving ſo pretty a fellow as Harry Mandeville, handſome, well made, lively, elegant; in the true claſſical ſtile,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0276901102:12"/>
and approved by the connoiſſeurs, by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame le Comteſſe de — herſelf, whom I look upon to be the greateſt judge of male merit on the face of the globe.</p>
            <p>It is not for loving him I am angry with you, but for entertaining ſo ridiculous a thought as that of marrying him. You have only one rational ſtep to take; marry Lord Melvin, who has title and fortune, requiſites not to be diſpenſed with in a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and take Harry Mandeville for your Ceciſbeo. The dear creature was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely diſpleaſed, as you, who know the romantic turn of her imagination, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive.</p>
            <p>O, I had almoſt forgot: yes, indeed, you have great right to give yourſelf jealous airs: we have not heard of your coquetry with Miſs Truman. My cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent tells me there is no doubt of its being a real paſſion on both ſides, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0276901102:13"/>
that the Truman family have been making private enquiries into your fortune. I ſhewed Lady Julia the letter, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how prettily ſhe bluſhed.</p>
            <p>But to be grave, I am afraid you have nothing to fear from Lord Melvin. You muſt forgive my making uſe of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; for, as I ſee no poſſibility of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting the obſtacles which oppoſe your union with Lady Julia, I am too much a friend to both, not to wiſh earneſtly, to break a connexion which has not a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of hope to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>But a truce to this ſubject, which is not a pleaſant one to either of us.</p>
            <p>I told you in my laſt I had ſomething to ſay to you. As I am your confidente, you muſt conſent to be mine, having a little preſent occaſion for your ſervices. You are to know, my dear Harry, that with all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0276901102:14"/>
my conquetry I am as much in love as your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and with almoſt as little proſpect of ſucceſs: this odious money is abſolutely the bane of us true lovers, and always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives to ſtand in our way.</p>
            <p>My dear ſpouſe then, who in the whole courſe of our acquaintance did but one obliging thing, being kindly determined I ſhould neither be happy with him nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, obligingly, tho' nobody knows this but myſelf, and the Caro Belville, made my jointure what it is, on condition I never married again: on obſervance of which condition it was to be in my power to give the eſtate to whoever I pleaſed at my death; but on a proof of my ſuppoſed future mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, it was to go immediately to a niece of his, who at his death was in a convent in France, who is ignorant of this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whoſe whole preſent fortune ſcarce amounts to fifteen hundred pounds. She is both in perſon and mind one of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0276901102:15"/>
moſt lovely of women, and has an affection for me, which inclines me to think ſhe would come into meaſures for my ſake, which I ſhall make it her intereſt to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in for her own.</p>
            <p>Belville's fortune is extremely mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and if I marry him at preſent, I ſhall not add a ſhilling to it; his income will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ſtatu-quo, with the incumbrance of an indigent woman of quality, whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are a little derange, and amongſt whoſe virtues oeconomy was never one of the moſt obſervable. He would with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port marry me to-morrow, even on theſe hard conditions; but how little ſhould I deſerve ſo generous a paſſion, if I ſuffered it to ſeduce him to his ruin? I have wrote to my niece to come to England, when I ſhall tell her my paſſion for Belville, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to her a private agreement to divide the fortune, which will be forfeited to her on my marriage, and which it is in my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0276901102:16"/>
power by living ſingle to deprive her of for ever. Incapable, however, of injuſtice I have at all events made a will, dividing it equally between her and Belville, if I die unmarried: I have a right to do this for the man I love, as my father left thirty thouſand pounds to Mr. Wilmot, which in equity ought to be regarded as mine, and which is all I deſire, on the diviſion: ſhe, therefore, by my will, has all ſhe ever can expect, even from the ſtricteſt juſtice: and ſhe can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I think, heſitate between waiting till my death, and at my mercy, and receiving the utmoſt ſhe could hope then, at the preſent.</p>
            <p>I have heard from the lady to whom I encloſed my letter, which ſhe has returned, my niece having left France a year ago, to accompany a relation into Italy. What I, therefore, have to aſk of you is, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to find her out, by your Italian friends, as I will by mine at the ſame time, that I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0276901102:17"/>
may write to her to return immediately to England, as I will not run the hazard of mentioning the ſubject in a letter. She is the daughter of the late colonel Haſtings, once abroad in a public character, and is well known in Italy.</p>
            <p>Belville is not at all in the ſecret of my ſcheme; nor did I ever tell him I would marry him, though I ſometimes give him reaſon to hope.</p>
            <p>I am too good a politician in love mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ever to put a man out of doubt till half an hour before the ceremony. The moment a woman is weak enough to promiſe, ſhe ſets the heart of her lover at reſt; the chace, and of conſequence the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is at an end; and he has nothing to do but to ſeek a new object, and begin the purſuit over again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0276901102:18"/>
I tell you, but I tell it in confidence, that if I find Bell Haſtings, if ſhe comes into my ſcheme, and my mind does not change, I may, perhaps, do Bellville the honor. And yet, when I reflect on the matter; on the condition of the obligation, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"ſo long as ye both ſhall live"</q>—Jeſu Maria! Only think of promiſing to be of the ſame mind as long one lives. My dear Harry, people may talk as they will, but the thing is utterly impoſſible.</p>

            <head>TO GEORGE MORDAUNT, Eſquire.</head>
            <p>I Have already told you I came hither with a view of engaging Lord T—'s intereſt in ſupport of thoſe views, on which all my hopes of happineſs depend. The friendſhip he has ever profeſſed for me has been warm as that of a father. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with him at Rome, and he there

            <p>On revolving my ſcheme as I approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, it appeared ſo romantic, ſo void of all rational hope, that I had not reſolution to mention it, and determined at leaſt to ſuſpend it till better digeſted, and more fitted to bear the cool eye of impartial reaſon: in theſe ſentiments I ſhould ſtill have remained, had not a letter from Lady Anne Wilmot, by giving me jealouſy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0276901102:20"/>
me not to defer one moment a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on which all my happineſs depended.</p>
            <p>I, therefore, with ſome heſitation, this morning opened all my heart, and the real ſtate of my circumſtances, to Lord T—, concealing only what related to Lady Julia. He heard me with great coolneſs, careleſsly lolling on a ſettee; his eyes fixed on a new Chineſe ſummer-houſe, oppoſite the window near which he ſat, and made me the following anſwer; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Your views, Mr. Mandeville, ſeem rather ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, for a man who has no party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, and ſo little parliamentary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. However, you are of a good family, and there are things to be had in time if properly recommended. Have you no friend who would mention you to the miniſter?"</q> He then rang the bell haſtily for his valet, and retired to dreſs, leaving me motionleſs with aſtoniſhment and indignation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0276901102:21"/>
We met no more till dinner, when he treated me with a diſtant civility, the meaning of which was eaſily underſtood. He apologized with an air of ceremony on his being forced to go for a fortnight to Scarborough, with a party, who being all ſtrangers, he was afraid would not be agreeable to me; but at his return he ſhould be glad of the honor of ſeeing me again. I bowed coldly, and took no other notice of what he ſaid, than to order my chaiſe immediately; on which he preſſed my ſtay to-night, but in vain. The ſervants leaving the room, he was a little diſconcerted, but obſerved, he was ſorry for me; my caſe was really hard; he always thought my fortune much larger; wondered at my father's indiſcretion in educating me ſo improperly—People ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their circumſtances—It was pity I had no friend—Lord Belmont, if he pleaſed, but he was ſo abſurdly fond of his independence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0276901102:22"/>
During this harangue I intirely reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my preſence of mind, and with an air of great eaſe and unconcern told his Lordſhip, I was much obliged to him for curing me of a purſuit ſo improper for a man of my temper: that the liberal offers of ſervice he had formerly made me at Rome, had betrayed me into a falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the friendſhip of great men; but that I was now convinced of what value ſuch profeſſions are, and that they are only made where it ſeems certain they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be accepted. That it was impoſſible his Lordſhip could judge properly of the conduct of a man of my father's character; that I was proud of being ſon to the moſt exalted and generous of mankind; and would not give up that honor to be firſt miniſter to the firſt prince on earth. That I never ſo ſtrongly felt the value of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence as at that moment, and did not wonder at the value Lord Belmont ſet on ſo ineſtimable a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0276901102:23"/>
I came away without waiting for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſtopped at an inn about ten miles off, where I am now waiting for one of my ſervants, whom I left behind to bring me a letter I expect to-day from Lady Anne Wilmot.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Mordaunt, what will become of your unhappy friend? The flattering hopes I fondly entertained are diſperſed like a flitting cloud. Lord T—'s behaviour has removed the veil which love had ſpread over the wildneſs of my deſign, and convinced me that ſucceſs is impoſſible. Where or to whom ſhall I now apply? Lord T— was him on whoſe friendſhip I moſt depended; whoſe power to ſerve me was greateſt, and whoſe profeſſions gave me moſt right to expect his ſervices.</p>
            <p>I here for ever give up all views—Can I then calmly give up the hopes of Lady
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0276901102:24"/>
Julia? I will go back, confeſs my paſſion to Lord Belmont, and throw myſelf on that goodneſs whoſe firſt delight is that of making others happy. Yet can I hope he will give his daughter, the heireſs of ſuch affluence—Diſintereſted and noble as he is, the falſe maxims of the world—Mordaunt, I am born to wretchedneſs—What have I gained by inſpiring the moſt angelic of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with pity? I have doomed to miſery her for whoſe happineſs I would ſacrifice my life.</p>
            <p>The ſervant I left at Lord T—, is this moment arrived; he has brought me a letter—I know not why, but my hand trembles, I have ſcarce power to break the ſeal.</p>

                  <p>I have long, my dear Mr. Mandeville, ſuſpected my Lord's deſign in favour of Lord Melvin, of which there is not now the leaſt doubt. Our coming away from his father's, on his arrival, was a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0276901102:30"/>
which then ſtruck me extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Lady Julia's ſtay there, on this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, would have been ill ſuited to the delicacy of her ſex and rank. Yet I am aſtoniſhed my Lord has not ſooner told her of it; but there is no accounting for the caprice of age. How ſhall I tell my dear Mr. Mandeville my ſentiments on this diſcovery! How ſhall I, without wounding a paſſion which bears no reſtraint, hint to him my wiſhes, that he would ſacrifice that love, which can only by its continuance make him wretched, to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Julia's peace of mind! That he would himſelf aſſiſt her to conquer an inclination which is incompatible with the views which the moſt indulgent of parents entertains for her happineſs? Views, the diſappointment of which, he has declared, will embitter his laſt hours! Make one generous effort, my amiable friend: it is glorious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer where conqueſt is moſt difficult: think of Lord Belmont's friendſhip; of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0276901102:31"/>
parental care of your fortune; of the pleaſure with which he talks of your virtues; and it will be impoſſible for you to continue to oppoſe that deſign on which his hopes of a happy evening of life are founded. Would you deny a happy evening to that life to which thouſands owe the felicity of theirs?</p>
                  <p>It is from you, and not Lady Julia, I expect this ſacrifice: the conſideration which will moſt ſtrongly influence you to make it, will for ever prevent her; it pains me to wound your delicacy, by ſaying I mean the difference of your fortunes. From a romantic generoſity ſhe will think herſelf obliged to that perſeverance, which the ſame generoſity now calls loudly on you to decline. If you have greatneſs of mind to give up hopes which can never be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, time and abſence may aſſiſt Lady Julia's filial ſweetneſs, and bring her to a compliance with her father's will. Believe,

that whilſt I write, my heart melts with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for you both; and that nothing but the tendereſt friendſhip could have urged me to ſo painful a taſk.</p>

            <p>O Mordaunt! till now I was never truly wretched. I have not even a glimpſe of hope remaining.

            <p>But Lady Julia—Heaven is my witneſs, to make her happy, I would this moment give up all my rights in her heart. I would myſelf lead her to the altar, though the ſame hand the next moment—Mordaunt, I will promiſe, if ſhe requeſts

it, to conſent to her marriage; but I will not to ſurvive it. My thoughts are all diſtraction—I cannot write to Lady Anne—I will write to the moſt lovely of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—She knows not the cruel requeſt of of her friend—Her love diſdains the low conſideration of wealth—Our hearts were formed for each other—She knows every ſentiment of my ſoul—She knows, that were I monarch of the world—O Mordaunt! is it poſſible—Can the gentle, the indulgent Lord Belmont;—but all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires to undo me: the beſt, the moſt mild of mankind is turned a tyrant to make me wretched. I will know from herſelf if ſhe conſents; I will give up my own hopes to her happineſs; but let me firſt be convinced it is indeed her happineſs, not the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of her father, to which I make ſo cruel a ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>I have wrote to Lady Julia, and am more calm: I have mentioned Lady Anne's
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0276901102:34"/>
queſt. I have told her, that though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, if I am ſtill bleſt in her affection, I will never reſign her but with life: but if ſhe can be happy with Lord Melvin, if ſhe aſks it, ſhe is this moment free. I have entreated her to conſult her own heart, without a thought of me; that I would die this moment to contribute to her peace; that the firſt purpoſe of my life is her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, with which my own ſhall never come in competition; that there is nothing I will ever refuſe her, but to ceaſe to think of her with adoration; that if ſhe wiſhes to marry Lord Melvin (Great Heaven! is it poſſible ſhe can wiſh it) I will return to Italy, and carry far from her a paſſion which can never ceaſe but in the grave.</p>
            <p>I will wait here an anſwer, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine where to go.</p>

            <p>WE have been all extremely buſy to-day, celebrating a harveſt-home; a long proceſſion of our village youths, all dreſt gaily in fine ſhirts, adorned with ribbands, paired with the handſomeſt of the country girls, in white jackets and pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats, garlands of flowers and wheat-ears on their heads, their rakes ſtreaming with various coloured ribbands, which glittered in the ſunbeams, preceded the harveſt cart; on which, in a bower of green boughs, ſtood a beautiful little girl, dreſt in the rural ſtile, with inimitable elegance, by the hands of Lady Julia herſelf. The gay proceſſion walked ſlowly through the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; a tabor and pipe playing before them, till they came before the houſe, where they danced a thouſand little ruſtic dances, the novelty of which charmed me extremely:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0276901102:40"/>
they then adjourned to the hall, where a plentiful feaſt was provided, and where the whole village were that night my Lord's gueſts.</p>
            <p>Lord Belmont is extremely fond of all theſe old cuſtoms, and will ſuffer none of them to be left off on his eſtate. The proſpect of this feſtivity, he ſays, chears them in their labor, and is a laudable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of gladneſs to that beneficent being, to whoſe bounty we owe the full reward of our toil, the plenteous harveſt, and who rejoices in the happineſs of his creatures.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſays my Lord, all theſe amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments encourage a ſpirit of matrimony, and encreaſe the number of my people.</p>
            <p>And pray, my dear Lord, do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage no other ſpirit!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0276901102:41"/>
No, Madam; Lady Belmont's anger and mine would, in ſuch a caſe, they know, contrary to that of the world, fall chiefly where it ought, on the ſeducer, who would be for ever expelled my eſtate, the heavieſt puniſhment I could poſſibly inflict. Then, as I am a declared enemy to intereſted mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, the young people are allowed to chuſe for themſelves, which removes the temptation to vice, which is generally cauſed by the ſhameful avarice of parents.</p>
            <p>Our example too is of great ſervice, and and allures them to a regular behaviour; they think that muſt be the happieſt life, which we, who have the power of chuſing, prefer; and therefore it is the faſhion amongſt them to be regular, and ſeek their happineſs, as we do, at home.</p>

            <p>AS I was ſitting alone this morning at the inn looking out at a window, I ſaw ride into the yard Mr. Herbert, the gentleman to whom I took ſo ſtrong an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination at Lord T—'s, and for whoſe character I have the higheſt eſteem. He ſaw me, and ſpringing eagerly from his horſe, ſent to know if I would admit him. He came, and after expreſſing ſome ſurprize at ſeeing me there, on my telling him I had left Lord T—'s, and waited there a few days for letters, he inſiſted on my ſpending that time at his houſe, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which it was impoſſible for me to refuſe. As we rode, he apologized for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0276901102:44"/>
I ſhould meet with; wiſhed for a larger ſhare of the gifts of fortune that he might receive his friends in a manner more ſuited to his deſires; but ſaid, if he knew me, the heart of the hoſt was all I ſhould care for; and that I ſhould reliſh the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meat of chearful friendſhip, as well as the ſplendid profuſion of luxury and pride.</p>
            <p>We arrived at a neat houſe, with a little romantic garden behind it, where we were received by Mrs. Herbert with that hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table air which is inſeparable from real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of heart. Her perſon was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pleaſing, and her dreſs elegantly plain. She had a little boy ſitting by her, lovely and playful as a Cupid.</p>
            <p>Neatneſs and propriety preſided at our frugal meat; and after a little deſert of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruit from their garden, Mr. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert took me the tour of his eſtate, which conſiſts of about ſeventy acres, which he culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0276901102:45"/>
himſelf, and has embelliſhed with every thing that can make it lovely: all has the appearance of content and peace: I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this to him, and added, that I infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely envied his happineſs. He ſtopped and looked earneſtly at me; I am indeed, ſaid he, happy in many things, and though my fortune is greatly below my birth and hopes, I am not in want; things may be better, till then I bear them as I can: my wife, whoſe worth outweighs all praiſe, combats our ill fate with a ſpirit I cannot always imitate; for her, Mr. Mandeville, for her, I feel with double keenneſs the ſtings of adverſity.</p>
            <p>I obſerved him too much affected to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſubject farther, I therefore changed it, and returned to the houſe: but I will not leave him till I am inſtructed how to draw the worm of diſcontent from one of the worthieſt of human boſoms.</p>

            <p>I AM charmed with Lady Mary; her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is eaſy, polite, attentive; ſhe is tall, brown, well made, and perfectly graceful; her air would inſpire awe, if not ſoftened by the utmoſt ſweetneſs and affability of behaviour. She has great vivacity in her looks and manner; her hair is quite white; her eyes have loſt their luſtre; yet it is eaſy to ſee ſhe has been very handſome; her hand and arm are yet lovely, of which ſhe is not a little vain: take her for all in all, ſhe is the fineſt ruin I ever beheld.</p>
            <p>She is full of anecdotes of the queen's time, choſe with judgment, and told with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0276901102:47"/>
which make her converſation infinitely amuſing. She has been ſaying ſo many fine things of Harry, who by the way ſtrongly reſembles her, that I begin to think the good old lady has a matrimonial deſign upon him : really not amiſs ſuch a ſcheme; fine remains, an affluent fortune, and as to years, eighty is abſolutely the beſt age I know for a wife, except eighteen. She thinks him, what is extremely in his favor, very like her brother, who was killed at the battle of Almanza.</p>
            <p>She has the talkativeneſs of age, which, where there is ſenſe and knowledge of the world, I do not diſlike; ſhe is learned in genealogy, and can tell you not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarriages, but the family virtues and vices of every ancient houſe in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as to the modern ones, ſhe does not think them worth ſtudying. I am high in her favour, becauſe my blood has never been contaminated by a city marriage. She
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0276901102:48"/>
tells me the women of my family have always been famous for a certain eaſe and bon air, which ſhe is glad to ſee is not loſt; and that my grand-mother was the greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Queen Mary's court.</p>
            <p>She has a great contempt for the preſent race of beauties, ſays the very idea of grace is almoſt loſt, and that we ſee nothing now but meer pretty women; that ſhe can only account for this, by ſuppoſing the trifling turn of their minds gives an inſignificance to their perſons; and that ſhe would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to learn to think and act, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being able to look and move, with dignity. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You, nephew, ſhe ſays, who remember each bright Churchill of the Galaxy, will readily come into my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion."</q> She does me the honor, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to ſay I am the moſt graceful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhe has ſeen ſince the Queen's time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0276901102:49"/>
She is a great politician, and ſomething inclined to be a tory, though ſhe profeſſes perfect impartiality; loves the king, and idolizes the queen, becauſe ſhe thinks ſhe ſees in her the ſweet affability ſo admired in her favourite Queen Mary—For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives the cits for their oppoſition to peace, becauſe they get more money by war, the criterion by which they judge of every thing: but is amazed nobles, born guardians of the juſt rights of the throne, the fountain of all their honors, ſhould join theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Change-alley politicians, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, from private pique, to weaken the hands of their ſovereign: But adds, with a ſigh, that mankind were always alike, and that it was juſt ſo in the Queen's Time.</p>

               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"But, pray nephew, this Canada;—I remember when Hill was ſent againſt it in the Queen's time, it was thought of great conſequence; and 2 or 3 years ago pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets were wrote, I am told, by men very well

            <head>TO GEORGE MORDAUNT, Eſquire.</head>
            <p>I AM ſtill with Mr. Herbert, whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, learning, and goodneſs of heart, make him an honor to human nature itſelf: I ſhall never know peace till I find a way to render his ſituation more worthy of his character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0276901102:52"/>
It was with great difficulty I drew from him the following ſhort account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in my paſt life but what is, I fear, too uſual to be worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating. Warmth of temper, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of youth, ſeduced me into a circle of company not to be kept up by one of my fortune, at a leſs price than ruin; and the ſame vanity, with inexperience, and a falſe opinion of mankind, betrayed me into views not leſs deſtructive.</p>
            <p>My father unhappily died when I was about nineteen, leaving me at college, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my own actions, of the little eſtate you ſee, and of four thouſand pounds; a ſum I then thought inexhauſtible. The reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a ſum in my own power, drew about me all the worthleſs young men of ſaſhion in the univerſity, whoſe perſuaſions and examples led me into a train of expence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0276901102:53"/>
to which my fortune was far from being equal; they flattered thoſe talents of which I thought but too well myſelf, and eaſily perſuaded me I only wanted to be known in the great world to riſe to what height I pleaſed. I accompanied them to town, full of the idea of raiſing my fortune, to which they aſſured me nothing ſo much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted as the appearance of being perfectly at eaſe. To this end I launched into every expence they propoſed, dreſs, equipage, play, and every faſhionable extravagance. I was well received every where, and thought my deſigns in a proſperous way. I found my fortune however decaying at the end of two years, but had not courage to enquire into particulars, till drawing upon my banker for money to pay ſome debts I had unwarily contracted, he told me he had already paid the whole.</p>
            <p>It was ſome time before he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of this; but finding his accounts
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0276901102:54"/>
had all the appearance of exactneſs, I was obliged to acquieſce, and went home in an agony of deſpair. Unable to quit a way of life which was become habitual, and which it was now impoſſible to ſupport without diſhoneſty, there is no deſcribing my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. After revolving a thouſand different ſchemes in my imagination, I determined to conceal the ſituation of my affairs, to ſell my eſtate, and before that money was gone, preſs my great friends to ſerve me.</p>
            <p>I applied to my banker, who undertook to ſend me a purchaſer; but before I had compleated my deſign I received by the poſt a bank note of five hundred pounds, the ſum I was indebted in town; with a letter, in a hand unknown to me, repreſenting in the moſt delicate manner, the imprudence of my paſt conduct, the madneſs of my views, and the certain conſequences of my parting with this my laſt ſtake: intreating me by the memory of my parents, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0276901102:55"/>
this ſacred depoſit, this little remain of what their tender care had left me.</p>
            <p>Melted with this generoſity, ſtruck with the juſt reproof, yet chained down to that world which had undone me; convinced, yet irreſolute; I ſtruggled with my own own heart to determine on retiring into the country; but to poſtpone as long as poſſible a retreat, which I could not bear to think of, reſolved firſt to try my great friends, and be certain of what I had to hope for. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them the neceſſity of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately attempting in earneſt to puſh my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and preſſing them cloſely, found their promiſes were air. They talked in general terms of their eſteem for me, of my merit, and each of them expreſſed the warmeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing me ſerved by any means but his own. As a means to animate their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid friendſhip, I diſcovered to them the real ſtate of my affairs; and from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment found myſelf avoided by them all;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0276901102:56"/>
they dropped me by degrees; were never at home when I called; and at length ceaſed even to bow to me in public; aſhamed of their own baſeneſs in thus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly deſerting me, after leading me into ruin, moſt of them ſought to excuſe it by blackening my character; whilſt the beſt of them affected coldly to pity me, as a vain fooliſh fellow, who had undone himſelf by forgetting his own primeval ſituation, and arrogantly preſuming to live with them.</p>
            <p>Burning with indignation, I determined at once to break the bands which held me captive; I ſold my equipage, diſcharged my debts, and came down to this place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to find out to whom I had been ſo obliged; and, by living on half my income, to repay this generous benefactor.</p>
            <p>I took lodgings in a farm-houſe, and ſoon found that peace of mind to which I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0276901102:57"/>
had long been a ſtranger. I tried every method to find out to whom I was indebted for an act of ſuch exalted friendſhip, but in vain; till one day, a relation being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of whom I had ſome ſuſpicion, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſtory, as of another, keeping my eyes fixed upon him; he remained perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unmoved; but happening to turn my head, I ſaw a confuſion in the air of a young lady in the room, with whom I had been bred in the greateſt intimacy, which excited all my attention. She ſaw me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her, and a bluſh overſpread her cheeks, which convinced me I had found the object of my ſearch. I changed the ſubject; and the next morning made her a viſit, when I with great difficulty drew from her a confeſſion, that having long had a tender eſteem for me, ſhe had, by a friend in a town, watched all my actions: that my banker had applied to that very friend to purchaſe my eſtate; on which, ſeeing me on the brink of abſolute ruin, ſhe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0276901102:58"/>
had taken what appeared to her the moſt probable means to prevent it; and was ſo happy as to ſee ſhe had ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay I need not tell you this noble creature was my dear Mrs. Herbert, the ſmalleſs of whoſe fortune added infinitely to the generoſity of the action, what ſhe had ſent me being within a trifle her all.</p>
            <p>I loved, I addreſſed her, and at length, was ſo happy as to call her mine. Bleſt in the moſt exalted paſſion for each other, a paſſion which time has rather encreaſed than abated, the narrowneſs of our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances is the only ill we have to complain of; even this we have borne with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the hope of happier days. A late accident has, however, broke in upon that tranquillity with which Heaven has hitherto bleſt us. It is now about ſix months ſince a lady, who tenderly eſteemed us both, ſent for me, and acquainted me ſhe had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0276901102:59"/>
procured for me of a gentleman, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily had been obliged to her, a living of above three hundred pounds a year, in a beautiful ſituation; and deſired I would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take orders. As I was originally educated with a view to the church, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with inexpreſſible joy, bleſſing that Heaven, which had thus rewarded my Sophia's generous affection, and given us all that was wanting to compleat our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. I ſet out for London with an exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart; where, after being ordained, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the preſentation, and went down to take poſſeſſion. The houſe was large and elegant, and betrayed me into furniſhing it rather better than ſuited my preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; but as I determined on the utmoſt frugality for ſome years, I thought this of little conſequence. I ſet men to work in the garden; and wrote my wife an account of our new reſidence, which made her eager to haſten her removal. The day of my coming for my family was fixed,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0276901102:60"/>
when my patron came down to his ſeat, which was within ſight of the rectory; I waited on him, and found him ſurrounded by wretches, to whom it was ſcarce poſſible to give the name of human; profligate, abandoned, loſt even to the ſenſe of ſhame; their converſation wounded reaſon, virtue, politeneſs, and all that mankind agree to hold ſacred. My patron, the wealthy heir of a Weſt Indian, was raiſed above them, only by fortune, and a ſuperior degree of ignorance and ſavage inſenſibility. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me with an inſolence, which I found great difficulty in ſubmitting to: and after ſome brutal general reflexions on the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, dared to utter expreſſions relating to the beauty of my wife, which fired my ſoul with indignation; breathleſs with rage, I had not power to reply: when one of the company ſpeaking low to him, he anſwered aloud, Hark, you Herbert, this blockhead thinks a parſon a gentleman; and wonders
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0276901102:61"/>
at my treating, as I pleaſe, a fellow who eats my bread.</p>
            <p>I will ſooner want bread, Sir, ſaid I, riſing, than owe it to the moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mankind. Your living is once more at your diſpoſal; I reſign all right to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this company.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure of having acted as I ought, ſwelled my boſom with conſcious delight, and ſupported me till I reached home; when my heart ſunk at the thought of what my Sophia might feel from the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our affairs too were a little em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſed, from which miſery I had hoped to be ſet free, inſtead of which my debts were encreaſed. Mr. Mandeville, if you never knew the horrors of being in debt, you can form no idea of what it is to breathe the air at the mercy of another; to labor, to ſtruggle to be juſt, whilſt the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0276901102:62"/>
cruel world are loading you with the guilt of injuſtice.</p>
            <p>I entered the houſe, filled with horrors not to be conceived. My wife met me with eager enquiries about our future reſidence; and with repeated thanks to that God who had thus graciouſly beſtowed on us the means of doing juſtice to all the world. You will imagine what I felt at that moment: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of replying, I related to her the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had met with, and the character of him to whom we were to be obliged; and aſked her, what ſhe would wiſh me to do? Reſign the living, ſaid ſhe, and truſt to that Heaven whoſe goodneſs is over all his creatures. I embraced her with tears of tender tranſport, and told her I had already done it. We wrote to the lady to whoſe friendſhip we had been obliged for the preſentation; and ſhe had the greatneſs of mind not to diſapprove my conduct. We have ſince practiſed a more ſevere frugality,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0276901102:63"/>
which we are determined not to relax till what we owe is fully diſcharged: time will, we hope, bring about this end, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the load which now oppreſſes my heart. Determined to truſt to Heaven and our own induſtry, and to aim at indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence alone, I have avoided all acquaintance which could interfere with this only rational plan: but Lord T— ſeeing me at the houſe of a nobleman, whoſe virtues do honor to his rank; and imagining my fortune eaſy from my cordial reception there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me earneſtly to his ſeat; where, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I ſuppoſe, been ſince undeceived as to my ſituation, you were a witneſs of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy treatment of me; of one deſcended from a family noble as his own, liberally educated, with a ſpirit equally above mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pride, and a heart which feels too ſenſibly to be happy in a world like this.</p>
            <p>Oh Mr. Mandeville! What can you think of him, who, inſtead of pouring out his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0276901102:64"/>
ſoul in thankfulneſs to Heaven for thoſe advantages he enjoys by its goodneſs above his fellow-creatures, makes uſe of them to wound the boſom of the wretched, and add double bitterneſs to the cup of adverſity.</p>
            <p>The real evils of a narrow fortune are trifling; its worſt pangs ſpring from the unfeeling cruelty of others; it is not always that philoſophy can raiſe us above the proud man's contumely, or thoſe thouſand inſults<q>
                  <l>" Which patient merit of th' unworthy takes."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You, Mr. Mandeville, are young, and full of probity; your own heart will miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead you, by drawing too flattering a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of others; the world is gay before you; and blinded by proſperity, you have never yet ſeen it as it is. I have heard you with infinite concern hint deſigns too like my own; let me intreat, let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0276901102:65"/>
you, to profit by my example; if peace is worth your care, be content with your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fortune, however ſmall; nor by raſhly launching on the flattering ſea of hope, hazard that ſhipwreck which I have ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Mordaunt! Is not this the voice of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? I will return to the boſom of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and give up deſigns in which it is almoſt impoſſible for modeſt worth to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>My father is in town; I will go to him when he returns; his advice ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my future conduct.</p>
            <p>A letter from Lady Julia: my ſervant has this moment brought it from Lord T—'s, whither I deſired it be directed, not chuſing to let them know I have put an end to my viſit, leſt Lord Belmont ſhould inſiſt on my return.</p>

                  <p>My duty, my gratitude to the beſt of parents, forbids my entering into preſent engagements without his knowledge; nor will I make future ones, which would have in view an event on which I cannot think without horror: but his commands, were he capable of acting ſo inconſiſtently with his paſt indulgent goodneſs, would be inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make me give my hand to Lord

Melvin, when my heart is fixedly ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's.</p>
                  <p>I may, perhaps, aſſume courage to own my ſenſibility, a ſenſibility juſtified by ſuch merit in the object, to the tendereſt of mothers and friends: in the mean time defer your return to Belmont, and hope every thing from time, my father's friendſhip, and my unalterable eſteem—Eſteem did I ſay? Where did I learn this coldneſs of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Let me own, though I am covered with bluſhes whilſt I write, it is from my love, my ardent love, from a paſſion which is the pride and boaſt of my life, that the moſt charming of mankind has every thing to hope; if his happineſs depends on my affection, he is happy.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall hear from me by Lady Anne, and my beloved Emily; at preſent you will not aſk to hear from me. Adieu!</p>

O Mordaunt! How ſhall I reſtrain the wild tranſports of my heart! Her love, her moſt ardent love—How could I ſuſpect her truth?—No, my friend, I aſk no more, I will not return to Belmont; certain of her tenderneſs, I ſubmit, without repining, to her commands.</p>
            <p>Unable, however, to reſiſt the deſire of being near her, I will go privately to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farm, four miles from Belmont, of which it has a view, which is rented by an old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of my father's, whoſe ſon is in love with one of Lady Belmont's maids, and from whom I ſhall hear daily accounts of Lady Julia; as it is near the road, I may even have a chance of ſeeing her paſs by.</p>

            <p>Mordaunt! ſhe loves me, ſhe will never be another's.</p>
            <p>This paſſion abſorbs me wholly: I had almoſt forgot my friend; go to my banker's, take a hundred pounds, and ſend it by the poſt to Mr. Herbert, without letting him know from whom it comes. Why is this trifle all that is in my power to do for worth like his? If a happier fate—But let me not encourage the fanguine hopes of youth.</p>

            <p>A Pretty ſentimental letter your laſt, and would make an admirable figure in a true hiſtory of Celadon and Urania. Abſolutely, though, Belville, for people who have ſenſibility, and ſo little proſpect of coming together in an honorable way, we are a moſt extraordinary pair of lovers. And yet the world—apropos to the world, a French author I am reading, ſays, a wiſe writer, to divert the fury of criticiſm from his works, ſhould throw it now and then an indiſcretion in his conduct to play with, as ſeamen do a tub to the whale.</p>
            <p>Do not you think this might be a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hint to us beauties? If I treat the good old ladies ſometimes with a little impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0276901102:71"/>
in regard to you, my complexion may eſcape the better for it.</p>
            <p>We are juſt returned from a party on the water, which, like moſt concerted parties, turned out exceedingly dull: we had gilded barges, excellent muſick, an elegant repaſt, and all that could invite pleaſure amongſt us; but whether her ladyſhip be a true coquette, flying faſteſt when purſued, or what is the reaſon I know not, but certain it is, one ſeldom finds her when one goes to ſeek her; her viſits are generally ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous and unexpected; ſhe rejects all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, and comes upon you in her own way, by ſurprize. I ſet off in high ſpirits, my heart beating with expectation, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſt a more languid day; I fancied every moment would be pleaſanter, but found the laſt hour as ſpiritleſs as the firſt. I ſaw chagrin and diſappointment in the eyes of half the company, eſpecially the younger part of it. Lady Julia's ſeemed to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0276901102:72"/>
ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"All this would be charming if Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mandeville was here."</q> My own ideas were ſomething ſimilar, I could not keep my imagination from wandering a little to Groſvenor-ſtreet; moſt of the miſſes were in the ſame ſituation, whilſt the good old people ſeemed perfectly ſatisfied; which convinces me that at a certain time of life there is no pleaſure without the heart; where that is untouched, and takes no part in your amuſements, all is ſtill life and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: it is in vain to expect enjoyment from outward objects, where the ſoul is from home.</p>
            <p>I miſſed my ſweet Harry exceedingly, for though not a lover, he is a divine fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and there is ſomething vaſtly amuſing in having ſo agreeable an object before one's eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0276901102:73"/>
Whenever I make a party of pleaſure, it ſhall conſiſt all of lovers, who have not met of a twelvemonth.</p>
            <p>Who ſhould we meet on our return, but Fondville, in a ſuperb barge, full of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, dying at the feet of the Cittadina, who was ſinging a melting Italian air. Yes, we are to be Lady Viſcounteſs Fondville, all is agreed, the clothes beſpoke, our very garters interwoven with coronets. I ſhall get off before the days of viſitation, for there will be no ſupporting Madame la Viſcomteſſe.</p>
            <p>I have been taking half an hour tete à tete with Lady Mary; and have let her into the ſecret of little Weſtbrook's paſſion for Harry: She drew up at the very mention, was aſtoniſhed, that a creature of yeſterday, could think of mixing his blood with that of Mandeville, declared ſhe knew but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houſes in Europe into which ſhe ſhould ever conſent to Harry's marrying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0276901102:74"/>
I took this opportunity of giving a hint of his inclination for Lady Julia, but am doubtful whether ſhe underſtood me. Oh! that he had Lord Melvin's expectations! But why do I wiſh for impoſſibilities? Let me rather wiſh, what is next to impoſſible, that Lord Belmont would overlook the want of them!</p>

            <p>O CIEL! Une avanture! Making uſe of the ſweet liberty of Belmont, which has no rule but that of the Thele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, <q rend="inline">"Do what thou wilt,"</q> I left them after dinner to ſettle family affairs, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my chariot to take a ſolitary airing: an old cat, however, arriving juſt as it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0276901102:75"/>
came to the door, who is a famous profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in ſcandal, a treat I am abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of at Belmont, I changed my mind, and aſked her to accompany me, that I might be amuſed with the ſecret hiſtory of all the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>She had torn to pieces half a dozen of the prettieſt women about us, when paſſing through a little village about ſix miles from Belmont, I was ſtruck with the extreme neatneſs of a ſmall houſe and garden near the road; there was an elegant plainneſs in the air of it, which pleaſed me ſo much, that I pulled the ſtring, and ordered the coachman to ſtop, that I might examine it more at leiſure. I was going to bid him drive on, when two women came out of an aroor, one of whom inſtantly engaged all my attention.</p>
            <p>Imagine to yourſelf in ſuch a place all that is graceful and lovely in woman; an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0276901102:76"/>
elegance of form and habit; a dignity of deportment; an air of delicate languor and ſenſibility, which won the heart at a look; a complexion inclining to pale; the fineſt dark eyes; with a countenance in which a modeſt ſorrow and dignified dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave the ſtrongeſt indications of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merit.</p>
            <p>My companion ſeeing the apparent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, with which I beheld this amiable object, began to give me a hiſtory of her, embittered by all the virulence of malice; which, however, amounted to no more, than that ſhe was a ſtranger, and that as nobody knew who ſhe was, they generouſly concluded ſhe was one whoſe intereſt it was not to be known.</p>
            <p>They now drew nearer to us; and the charming creature raiſing her eyes, and then firſt ſeeing us, exclaimed, Good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! Lady Anne Wilmot! Is it poſſible!
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0276901102:77"/>
I now regarded her more attentively, and though greatly changed ſince I ſaw her, knew her to be Bell Haſtings, Mr. Wilmot's niece, whom I had been long endeavouring to find. I ſprung from the chariot to meet her, and need not tell you my tranſport at ſo unexpected a rencounter.</p>
            <p>After the common enquiries on meeting, I expreſſed my ſurprize at finding her there, with a gentle reproach at her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs in being in England without letting me know it. She bluſhed, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed embarraſſed at what I ſaid; on which I changed the ſubject, and preſſed her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me immediately to Belmont, the place on earth where merit like hers was moſt ſure of finding its beſt reward, eſteem. She declined this propoſal in a manner which convinced me ſhe had ſome particular reaſon for refuſing, which I doubted not her taking a proper time to explain, and therefore gave it up for the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0276901102:78"/>
preſent. I inſiſted, however, on her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to go with me to town; and that nothing but a matrimonial engagement ſhould ſeparate her from me. There is no deſcribing the exceſs of her gratitude, tears of tender ſenſibility ſhone in her eyes; and I could ſee her boſom ſwell with ſenſations to which ſhe could not give utterance.</p>
            <p>An hour paſſed without my having thought of my meagre companion at the gate. I was not ſorry for having acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally mortified the envious wretch for her ſpite to poor Bell. However, as I would not deſignedly be ſhocking, I ſent to her, and apologized for my neglect, which I excuſed from my joy at meeting unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly with a relation for whom I had the tendereſt friendſhip. The creature alighted at my requeſt; and to make amends for the picture ſhe had drawn of my amiable niece, overwhelmed her with civilities and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of eſteem, which would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0276901102:79"/>
my contempt for her, if any thing in nature could.</p>
            <p>After tea we returned, when I related my adventure, and, though ſo late, could ſcarce prevail on Lady Belmont to defer her viſit to Bell till to-morrow. She hopes to be able to prevail on her to accompany us back to Belmont.</p>

            <p>I Write this from my new abode, a little ſequeſtered farm, at the ſide of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic wood: there is an arbor in the thickeſt grove of intermingled jeſſamines and roſes.

            <p>Not certain Lady Julia would forgive my being ſo near her, or a concealment which has ſo guilty an air, I have enjoined William ſecrecy even to his Anna, and bribed it by a promiſe of making him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. My letters therefore come round by Mr. Herbert's, and it is three days before I receive them. I have not yet heard from Belmont, or my father. I am ſuppoſed to be ſtill at Lord T—'s.</p>
            <p>Ever an enthuſiaſt, from warmth of heart and imagination, my whole ſoul is devoted to Lady Julia. I paſs my days in carving that loved name on the rinds of the ſmootheſt trees: and when the good old man retires to his reſt, William and I ſteal

            <p>Since I left Belmont, I have never known happineſs like what I now feel. Certain of her tenderneſs, tranquillity is reſtored to my ſoul: for ever employed in thinking of her; that painful reſtraint which company brought is removed; the ſcenes around me, and the dear ſolitude I enjoy, are proper to flatter a love-ſick heart; my paſſion is ſoothed by the artleſs expreſſion of Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's; I make him ſit hours talking of his Anna: he brings me every day intelligence of my angel; I ſee every hour the place which ſhe inhabits.

I walk in theſe ſweet ſhades, ſo reſembling thoſe of Belmont, I look round as if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to behold her; I ſtart at every ſound, and almoſt fancy her lovely form in my view.</p>

                     <p>BEFORE I abſolutely accept or refuſe your ladyſhip's generous invitation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to account to you for my being in a place where you ſo little expected to find me, but which I am convinced you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in my continuing in, when you know the motives which induced me to make choice of it.</p>

When my uncle married your ladyſhip, you may remember he left me in a convent at Paris, where I ſtaid till his death. I ſhould then have returned, but having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a very tender friendſhip for a young lady of the firſt quality in England, ſhe preſſed me to continue there till her return, which was fixed for the year following. About three months before we intended to leave Paris, her brother arrived, on which occaſion ſhe left the convent, and went to ſpend her remaining time with an aunt who then reſided in France, and who being told I had ſtaid the laſt year in complaiſance to her amiable niece, inſiſted on my accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying her: to ſpare a long narrative of common events, the brother of my friend became paſſionately in love with me, and I was ſo unhappy as to be too ſenſible to his tenderneſs: he intreated me to conceal our attachment from his ſiſter for the preſent; profeſſed the moſt honorable deſigns; told me he did not doubt of bringing his father to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0276901102:85"/>
conſent to a marriage to which there could be no objection that was not founded in the moſt fordid avarice, and on which the happineſs of his life depended.</p>
                     <p>The time of our intended return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land drawing near, he employed, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, the power he had over my heart, to influence my acceptance of an invitation given me, by a friend of my mother's, to accompany her to Florence, where I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſtay till his return from Rome.</p>
                     <p>Too much in love, as he ſaid, and I weakly believed, to ſupport a longer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he came in a few months to Florence; we were then in the country with a Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine nobleman, whoſe lady was related to my friend, to whom he was ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and who gave him an invitation to his villa; which I need not tell you he accepted. We ſaw each other continually, but under a reſtraint, which, whilſt it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0276901102:86"/>
our mutual paſſion, was equally painful to both. At length he contrived to give me a letter, preſſing me to ſee him alone in the garden at an hour he mentioned. I went, and found the moſt beloved of men waiting for me in a grove of oranges. He ſaw me at a diſtance: I ſtopped by an involuntary impulſe; he ran to me, he approached me with a tranſport which left me no room to doubt of his affection.</p>
                     <p>After an hour ſpent in vows of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, he preſſed me to marry him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, which I refuſed with an air of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but little ſuited to the ſtate of my heart, and proteſted no conſideration ſhould ever induce me to give him my hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of his father.</p>
                     <p>He expreſſed great reſentment of a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which he affirmed was inconſiſtent with a real paſſion; pretended jealouſy of a young nobleman in the houſe, and artfully
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0276901102:87"/>
hinted at returning immediately to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; then ſoftening his voice, implored my compaſſion, vowed he could not live without me, and ſo varied his behaviour from rage to the moſt ſeducing ſoftneſs, that the fear of diſpleaſing him, who was dearer to me than life, aſſiſted by the tender perſuaſive eloquence of well diſſembled love, ſo far prevailed over the dictates of reaſon and ſtrict honor, that unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his deſpair, I conſented to a clandeſtine marriage: I then inſiſted on returning im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the houſe, to which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, though unwillingly, and leaving me with all the exulting raptures of ſucceſsful love, went to Florence to prepare a prieſt to unite us, promiſing to return with him in the morning: the next day paſſed, and the next, without my hearing of him: a whole week elapſed in the ſame manner: convinced of his affection my fears were all for his ſafety, my imagination preſented danger in every form, and no longer able to ſupport
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0276901102:88"/>
terrors of my mind filled with a thouſand dreadful ideas, I ſent a ſervant to enquire for him at the houſe where he lodged, who brought me word he had left Florence the very morning on which I expected his return. Thoſe only who have loved like me can conceive what I felt at this news; but judge into what an abyſs of miſery I was plunged, on receiving a few hours after a letter from his ſiſter, preſſing me to return to her at Paris, where ſhe was ſtill wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in compliance with orders from home, for her brother, who was to accompany her to England directly to marry an heireſs for whom he had been long intended by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſhe added that I muſt not loſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that her brother would, before I could receive the letter, be on the road to Paris.</p>
                     <p>Rage, love, pride, reſentment, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now tore my boſom alternately. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a conflict of different paſſions, I determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0276901102:89"/>
on forgetting my unworthy lover, whoſe neglect appeared to me the contemptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of ſuperior fortune: I left the place the next day, as if for Paris, but taking the neareſt way to England, came hither to a clergyman's widow, who had been a friend of my mother's, to whom I told my ſtory, and with whom I determined to ſtay concealed, till I heard the fate of my lover. I made a ſolemn vow, in the firſt heat of my reſentment, never to write to him, or let him know my retreat, and, though with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difficulty, I have hitherto kept it. But what have I not ſuffered for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which, though my reaſon dictates, my heart condemns! A thouſand times have I been on the point of diſcovering myſelf to him, and at leaſt giving him an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of vindicating himſelf. I accuſe myſelf of injuſtice in condemning him unheard, and on appearances which might be falſe. So weak is a heart in love, that though when I choſe my place of retreat, I was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0276901102:90"/>
of that circumſtance, it was with pleaſure, though a pleaſure I endeavoured to hide from myſelf, that I heard it was only ten miles from his father's ſeat. I ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to have changed it on this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but find a thouſand plauſible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the contrary, and am but too ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in deceiving myſelf.</p>
                     <p>Convinced of the propriety of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in avoiding him, I am not the more happy. My heart betrays me, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him continually to my imagination in the moſt amiable light, as a faithful lover, injured by my ſuſpicions, and made wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my loſs.</p>
                     <p>Torn by ſentiments which vary every moment; the ſtruggles of my ſoul have impaired my health, and will in time put an end to a life, to the continuance of which, without him, I am perfectly indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</p>

Determined, however, to perſiſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which, whatever I ſuffer from it, is certainly my duty, I cannot, as I hear he is returned, conſent to come to Belmont, where it is ſcarce poſſible I ſhould fail meeting a man of his rank, who muſt undoubtedly be of Lord Belmont's acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>Till he is married, or I am convinced I have injured him, I will not leave this retreat; at leaſt I will not appear where I am almoſt certain of meeting him whom I ought for ever to avoid.</p>
                     <p>O Lady Anne! How ſevere is this trial! How painful the conqueſt over the ſweeteſt affections of the human heart! How mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying to love an object which one has ceaſed to eſteem! Convinced of his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, my paſſion remains the ſame, nor will ever ceaſe but with life: I at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and adore him: yes, my tenderneſs is, if poſſible, more lively than ever; and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0276901102:92"/>
though he has doomed me to miſery, I would die to contribute to his happineſs.</p>
                     <p>You, Madam, will, I know, pity and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the inconſiſtencies of a heart aſhamed of its own weakneſſes, yet too ſincere to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe or palliate them. I am no ſtranger to your nobleneſs of ſentiment; in your friendſhip and compaſſion all my hopes of tranquillity are founded. I will endeavour to conquer this ill-placed prepoſſeſſion, and render myſelf more worthy your eſteem. If his marriage with another makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to ſuppoſe I throw myſelf deſignedly in his way, I will go with you to town in the winter, and try if the hurry of the world can eraſe his image from my boſom. If he continues unconnected, and no accident clears up to me his conduct, I will continue where I am, and for ever hide my folly in this retreat.</p>

Poor Bell! how I pity her! Heaven certainly means love for our reward in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, it ſo ſeldom makes it happy in this. But why do we blame heaven? It is our own prejudices, our rage for wealth, our cowardly compliance with the abſurd opinions of others, which robs us of all the real happineſs of life.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad to know who this deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable fellow is: though really it is poſſible ſhe may injure him; I muſt know his name, and find out whether or not ſhe is torturing herſelf without reaſon. If he bears ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing, our plans may coincide, and my jointure make us all happy; if not, he ſhall have the mortification of knowing ſhe has an eaſy fortune; and of ſeeing her, what it ſhall be my buſineſs to make her next winter, one of the moſt faſhionable women, and celebrated toaſts, about town.</p>

After all, are we not a little in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine ſtyle, not to be able to withdraw our love when our eſteem is at an end? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one might find a philoſophical reaſon for this in Newton's Laws of Attraction. The heart of a woman does, I imagine, naturally gravitate towards a handſome, well-dreſſed, well-bred fellow, without enquiry into his mental qualities. Nay, as to that, do not let me be partial to you odious men; you have as little taſte for mere internal charms as the lighteſt coquette in town. You talk ſometimes of the beauties of the mind; but I ſhould be glad, as ſomebody has ſaid very well, to ſee one you of in love with a mind of threeſcore.</p>
               <p>I am really ſorry for Bell, but hope to bring her out of theſe heroics by Chriſtmas. The town air, and being followed five or ſix weeks as a beauty, will do wonders. I know no ſpecific for a love-fit like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant crowd of pretty fellows.</p>
               <p>

The world, I dare ſay, will ſoon reſtore her to her ſenſes; it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould ever regain them in a lonely vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, with no company but an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>How dearly we love to nurſe up our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies! Bell, I dare ſay, fancies vaſt merit in this romantic conſtancy to a man who, if he knew her abſurdity, would laugh at it.</p>
               <p>I have no patience with my own ſex, for their want of ſpirit.</p>

               <p>All this is very ſtrange to me.

I am glad to hear this laſt circumſtance, and hope Bell has wronged him by her ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>But who can this be that is intended for Lady Julia?

            <p>O Mordaunt!

My heart beat with unutterable tranſport; it was with difficulty I reſtrained myſelf.</p>

            <p>CAN the moſt refined of her ſex, at the very moment when ſhe owns her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhocked at Mrs. H—'s malicious inſinuation, refuſe to ſilence her by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me happy? Can ſhe ſubmit to one of the keeneſt evils a ſenſible and delicate mind can feel, only to inflict torment on the man whoſe whole happineſs depends on her, and to whoſe tenderneſs ſhe has owned herſelf not inſenſible?</p>
            <p>Seeing your averſeneſs to marriage, I have never preſſed you on a ſubject which ſeemed diſpleaſing to you, but left it to time and my unwearied love, to diſſipate thoſe unjuſt and groundleſs prejudices, which ſtood in the way of all my hopes: but does not this reſpect, this ſubmiſſion,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0276901102:103"/>
demand that you ſhould ſtrictly examine thoſe prejudices, and be convinced, before you make it, that they deſerve ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?</p>
            <p>Why will you, my deareſt Lady Anne, urge your paſt unhappineſs as a reaſon againſt entering into a ſtate of which you cannot be a judge? You were never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; the ſoft conſent of hearts, the tender ſympathy of yielding minds, was wanting: forced by the will of a tyrannic father to take on you an inſupportable yoke, too young to aſſert the rights of humanity; the freedom of your will deſtroyed; the name of marriage is profaned by giving it to ſo deteſtable an union.</p>
            <p>You have often ſpoke with pleaſure of thoſe ſweet hours we paſt at Sudley Farm. Can you then refuſe to perpetuate ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? Are there no charms in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved converſe of the man who adores
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0276901102:104"/>
you? Or can you prefer the unmeaning flattery of fools you deſpiſe, to the animated language of faithful love?</p>
            <p>If you are ſtill inſenſible to my happineſs, will not my intereſt prevail on you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent? My uncle, who has juſt loſt his only ſon, offers to ſettle his whole eſtate on me, on condition I immediately marry; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it depends on you alone whether I ſhall comply with. If you refuſe, he gives it on the ſame terms to a diſtant relation, whoſe miſtreſs has a leſs cruel heart. Have you ſo little generoſity as to condemn me at once to be poor and miſerable; to loſe the gifts both of love and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?</p>
            <p>I have wrote to Lady Belmont to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for me, and truſt infinitely more to her eloquence than my own.</p>
            <p>

The only rational objection to my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs my uncle's eſtate removes; you will bring me his fortune, and your own will make Bell Haſtings happy: if you now refuſe, you have the heart of a tygreſs, and delight in the miſery of others.</p>

               <salute>My dear Col.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY a clauſe in the patent, which has been hitherto kept ſecret in our part of the family, it is provided that on default of heirs male in the younger branch, the title of Earl of Belmont ſhould go to the elder: in favor alſo of this diſpoſition, the greateſt part of the eſtate then in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, which is about half what I now enjoy, is, by a deed, in which, however, my lawyer tells me there is a flaw, which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0276901102:117"/>
makes it of no effect, annexed to the title for ever. Julia being the only child we ever had, it is very probable the eſtate and title will be yours: Heaven having bleſt you with a ſon, it would be infinitely agreeable to me, and would keep up the ſplendor of our name, to agree on an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage between our children. I would have you educate your ſon with this view, and at an expence becoming the heir of the titles and poſſeſſions of our family: but as it is poſſible I may yet have a ſon, in that caſe, Lady Mary our relation, whoſe heart is greatly ſet on this marriage, will ſettle her eſtate on yours, and I will give him my daughter, with twenty thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>I inſiſt on being at the whole expence of his education as my heir; as the eſtate will probably be his own, it is only anticipating his rents a few years, and does not lay him under the ſhadow of an obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0276901102:118"/>
I have mentioned above, that there is a defect in the deed, which puts it in my power to rob you of your right in the eſtate: but, as the deſign of our anceſtor is clear, I take no merit to myſelf from not being the moſt infamous of mankind, which I ſhould be, were I capable of making uſe of ſuch a circumſtance to your diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>But, could I reconcile ſo baſe an action to myſelf in a private light, no conſideration could make it eaſy to me in a public one: I know nothing ſo dangerous to our happy conſtitution as an indigent nobility, chained down to a neceſſity of court dependence, or tempted, by making faction the tool of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to diſturb the internal peace of their country. Men who are at eaſe in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are generally good ſubjects; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of what they have is a powerful tie of obedience: it is the needy, the diſſolute, the Caeſars, the Catilines of the world,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0276901102:119"/>
who raiſe the ſtorms which ſhake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of government.</p>
            <p>You will imagine, my dear friend, I only intend this alliance to take place, if their ſentiments, when of age to judge for themſelves, correſpond with our intentions for their happineſs: that this may be the caſe, let us educate them with the utmoſt care, in every accompliſhment of mind and perſon, which can make them lovely in the eyes of each other.</p>

            <p>I AM greatly obliged to your Lordſhip for a propoſal which does my ſon ſuch honor; and for a conduct towards us both ſo noble and worthy your character.</p>
            <p>The diſpoſition you mention is what I have ſometimes hoped, but knew your Lordſhip's honor and integrity too well to think it neceſſary to make any enquiry; convinced, if a ſettlement was made in my favor, you would in due time make me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it: till ſome probability ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of its taking place, it was, perhaps, better concealed than diſcloſed.</p>
            <p>The alliance your Lordſhip propoſes, if it ever takes place, will make me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of mankind: having, however, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved marriages made by parents in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0276901102:121"/>
childhood of the parties, to be generally diſagreeable to the latter, whether from the perverſeneſs of human nature, or the free ſpirit of love impatient of the leaſt controll, will intreat our deſign may be kept ſecret from all the world, and in particular from the young people themſelves: all we can do, is to give them ſuch an education as will beſt improve the gifts of nature, and render them objects of that lively and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate affection which alone can make ſuch a connexion happy. Perhaps it may be beſt to ſeparate them till the time when the heart is moſt ſuſceptible of tenderneſs, leſt an habitual intercourſe ſhould weaken that impreſſion which we wiſh their perfections to make on each other. Both at preſent promiſe to be lovely, and, if we guard againſt other attachments, the charm of novelty, added to what nature has done for them, and thoſe acquired graces which it is our part to endeavour to give them, can
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0276901102:122"/>
ſcarce fail of inſpiring a mutual paſſion, which ones ſeeming to deſire it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably prevent.</p>
            <p>If I am ſo happy as to have your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's concurrence in theſe ſentiments, I will remove my ſon immediately from your neighbourhood, and educate him in town; at a proper time he ſhall go, with a private tutor of birth and merit, to the univerſity, and from thence make the tour of Europe, whilſt Lady Julia is advancing in every charm under the eye of the moſt excellent of mothers.</p>
            <p>Men, who act a conſpicuous part on the ſtage of life, and who require a certain au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity and ſelf-poſſeſſion to bring their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents into full light, cannot, in my opinion, have too public an education: but women, whoſe lovelieſt charm is the roſy bluſh of native modeſty, whoſe virtues bloſſom faireſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0276901102:123"/>
in the vale, ſhould never leave their houſhold gods, the beſt protectors of innocence.</p>
            <p>It is alſo my requeſt, that my ſon may be educated in a total ignorance of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in our favor, both becauſe the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it may poſſibly be deſtroyed by your Lordſhip's having a ſon, and becauſe he will taſte the pleaſures of a diſtinguiſhed ſtation, if he ever arrives at it, with double reliſh, if bred with more moderate expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He will by this means too eſcape the pernicious ſnares of flattery, the ſervile court of intereſted inferiors, and all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious miſchiefs which poiſon the minds of young men bred up as heirs to great eſtates and titles: he will ſee the hatefulneſs of pride and arrogance in others before he is tempted to be guilty of them himſelf; he will learn to eſteem virtue without thoſe trappings of wealth and greatneſs which he will never hope to be poſſeſſed of: he will ſee the world as
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0276901102:124"/>
it is by not being of conſequence enough to be flattered or deceived.</p>
            <p>His education, his company, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, ſhall, however, be ſuited to the rank he may one day poſſibly fill; my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with foreign courts enables me to introduce him every where to thoſe of the firſt rank and merit; his equipage and attendance ſhall be ſuch as may ſecure him general reſpect.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip's generous offer of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expence of his education, deſerves my ſincereſt gratitude; but oeconomy will enable me to ſupport it without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to my affairs: half my income, which I will ſpare to him, with his mother's fortune, which ſhall all be devoted to this purpoſe, will be ſufficient to give him an education becoming the heir of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's fortune and honors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0276901102:125"/>

               <p>THIS joy is a prodigious enemy to ſleep. Lady Julia roſe this morning with the ſun; I dare ſay ſhe never thought he looked ſo bright; before he ſets ſhe will ſee the moſt charming of mankind. My Lord yeſterday ſent an expreſs to Lord T—'s,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0276901102:126"/>
with orders to follow Harry wherever he was, and bring him this evening to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont: Lady Mary is to have the pleaſure of making him acquainted with his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: the diſcovery was only delayed till convinced of their paſſion for each other.</p>
               <p>Colonel Mandeville is in town, directing the drawing of the writings; and comes down in a few days to have them executed.</p>
               <p>I have had a ſecond letter from Lord Melvin, as reſpectful as the pride of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can deſire: a poſtſcript from Lord Rochdale having ſatisfied me in point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum, I allow his ſon to viſit here when he pleaſes. My niece and Emily Howard come this evening; Lady Julia is now with them; I ſuppoſe we ſhall ſee Lord Melvin to-morrow: if he is very preſſing they may, perhaps, be married with Lady Julia.</p>

Heavens! Bellville! What a change in all our affairs! The matrimonial ſtar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails; it would be ſtrange if I ſhould be betrayed into the party: and yet, Lady Mary has drawn ſo bewitching a plan of a wedding-day, as might ſeduce a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined coquette: if one could be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for that day only—Or if one was ſure of pleaſing for ever like Lady Belmont—<q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Dear madam, ſaid I, if your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would lend one your Ceſtus.'</q>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">  "You are already poſſeſſed of it, my dear Lady Anne, the delicacy and purity of a bride will always give you the charms of one."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I believe her Ladyſhip may be in the right; it is not the ſtate, but the fooliſh conduct of people who enter into it, that makes it unhappy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0276901102:128"/>
If you ſhould come down with Colonel Mandeville, it is impoſſible to ſay what may happen.</p>
               <p>Abſolutely, Bellville, if I do condeſcend, which is yet extremely doubtful, we will live in the ſtyle of lovers, I hate the dull road of common marriages: no imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent preſuming on the name of huſband; no ſaucy freedoms; I will continue to be courted, and ſhall expect as much flattery, and give myſelf as many ſcornful airs, as if I had never honored you with my hand.</p>
               <p>I give you warning, I ſhall make a moſt intolerable wife; but that is your buſineſs, not mine.</p>
               <p>This very day ſe'nnight, which is Lady Julia's birth-day, is intended for her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; the houſe is to be full of company invited to celebrate the day, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what further account; nobody is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0276901102:129"/>
even to ſuſpect them to be lovers; they are to go privately out of Lady Mary's apartment into the chapel, where my Lord chuſes the ceremony ſhould be performed. We are to have a maſquerade in a grand open pavillion, on Corinthian pillars, built for this happy occaſion in the garden oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the houſe; which is to be in view finely illuminated: the intermediate ſpace is to be adorned with lamps, intermixed with feſtoons of flowers in the trees, round which are to be ſeats for the villagers, who are never forgot on theſe days of annual rejoicing.</p>
               <p>Lady Mary, who is miſtreſs of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and who inſiſts on joining all our hands that day, has engaged you for the ball to Lady Julia, Harry to Bell Haſtings, and Lord Melvin to me: our ſituation is to be kept ſecret for a week, which is to be filled up with various ſcenes of feſtivity; after which we are to go to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0276901102:130"/>
town to be preſented, and from thence on a tour of ſix months to Italy. This is her ſcheme, but it depends on Bell Haſtings and me whether it ſhall be executed in full: ten thouſand to one but our cruelty ſpoils the prettieſt myſterious plan of a wedding that can be. Abſolutely Lady Mary has a kind of an idea of things—I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how ſhe came by it—Not the leaſt ſymptom of an old maid in this plan—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo fanciful and like a love affair—It is a thouſand pities her Ladyſhip ſhould not be be of the party herſelf. Do you know never a ſprightly old courtier of the Queen's time?</p>
               <p>My Lord is ſo pleaſed with the thought of ſeeing us all happy, that he has given orders for building a temple to Love and Friendſhip at a little villa which the colonel has given him, and which is almoſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical in reſpect to all our houſes; here we
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0276901102:131"/>
are to meet once a week, and exclude the reſt of the world.</p>
               <p>Harry and Lady Julia are to live at Lady Mary's ſeat, about ten miles from hence, and I have fixed on a houſe, which is to be ſold, at about the ſame diſtance.</p>
               <p>And now, Bellville, to be very ſerious, I ſhould be the happieſt creature in the world in this proſpect, if I was not afraid of my own conduct. I am volatile, light, extravagant, and capricious; qualities ill ſuited to matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial life. I know my faults, but am not able to mend them: I ſee the beauty of order in the moral world, yet doat to exceſs on irregularity.</p>
               <p>Call on Colonel Mandeville, and concert your journey together. Heaven and earth I What have I not ſaid in that permiſſion? With all my affection for you there is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity in the idea—O Bellville! ſhould I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0276901102:132"/>
ever become leſs dear to you! ſhould cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelſs, ſhould indifference ever take place of that lively endearing tenderneſs—I will throw away the pen for a moment—</p>
               <p>The moſt amiable of men will forgive the too anxious fears of exceſſive love: I with tranſport make him the arbiter of my future days. Lady Julia is come back, and has brought me the encloſed bond, by which Bell Haſtings engages to pay you thirty thouſand pounds on the day of my marriage. Her letter to you will explain this further.</p>

him ſtrongly to me laſt night for a huſband. I heard her with the utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and when ſhe had finiſhed her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, bluſhed, looked down, heſitated, and denied the thing with ſo pretty a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that ſhe is gone away perfectly convinced I am to be Lady Anne Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and will tell it as a ſecret all round the country. I am not ſorry for this, as it will take away all ſuſpicion of what is really intended, and ſecure that ſecrecy we wiſh on the occaſion. The good old Lady went away infinitely delighted at being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a quality ſecret, which in the country gives no little importance; pleaſed too with her own penetration in diſcovering what nobody elſe has ſuſpected: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive a happier being than ſhe is at preſent.</p>

                  <p>YOU will receive this from the hands of that ſon I have before had the honor of recommending to your eſteem.</p>
                  <p>I have accompanied him myſelf hither, where being perfectly ſatisfied with his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, and convinced that generous minds are beſt won to virtue by implicit confidence, I have diſmiſſed the tutor I intended to have ſent with him to Italy, ſhall return to England

myſelf, and depend for his conduct on his own diſcretion, his deſire of obliging me, and that nobleneſs of ſentiment which will make him feel the value of my friendſhip for him in its utmoſt extent.</p>
                  <p>I have given him letters to the moſt worthy perſons in every court I intend he ſhould viſit, but as my chief dependence for the advantages of this tour, are on the count and yourſelf, I have adviſed him to ſpend moſt of his time at Rome, where, honored by your friendſhip, I doubt not of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that laſt finiſhing, that delicate poliſh, which, I flatter myſelf, if not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fondneſs of a parent, is all he wants to make him perfectly amiable.</p>
                  <p>To you, Madam, and the count I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him; defend him from the ſnares of vice, and the contagion of affectation.</p>

You receive him an unexperienced youth, with lively paſſions, a warm and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate heart, an enthuſiaſtic imagination, probity, openneſs, generoſity; and all thoſe advantages of perſon and mind, which a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral education can beſtow. I expect him from your hands a gentleman, a man of honor and politeneſs, with the utmoſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſentiment and character, adorned by that eaſy elegance, that refined ſimplicity of manner, thoſe unaffected graces of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment ſo difficult to deſcribe, but which it is ſcarce poſſible to converſe much with you without acquiring.</p>
                  <p>Senſible of the irreſiſtible power of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I think it of the utmoſt conſequence with what part of the female world he converſes. I have from childhood habituated him to the converſation of the moſt lovely and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite amongſt the beſt part of the ſex, to give him an abhorrence to the indelicacy of the worſt. I have endeavoured to impreſs on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0276901102:139"/>
his mind, the moſt lively ideas of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beauty of virtue; and to cultivate in him that elegance of moral taſte, that quick ſenſibility, which is a nearer way to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than the dull road of inanimate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
                  <p>Continuing the ſame anxious cares, I ſend him to perfect his education, not in ſchools or academies, but in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt charming amongſt women: the ardent deſire of pleaſing you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming worthy your eſteem, inſeparable from the happineſs of knowing you, will be the keeneſt ſpur to his attainments, and I ſhall ſee him return all the fond heart of a parent can wiſh, from his ambition of being honored with your friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>To you, Madam, I ſhall make no ſecret of my wiſh, that he may come back to England unconnected. I have a view for him beyond his moſt ſanguine hopes, to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0276901102:140"/>
which, however, I entreat he may be a ſtranger; the charms of the Lady cannot fail of attaching a heart which has no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, from which, I conjure you, if poſſible, to guard him. I ſhould even hear with pleaſure you permitted him, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree, to love you, that he might be ſteeled to all other charms. If he is half as much in love with you as his father, all other beauties will lay ſnares for him in vain;</p>

               <p>It is now a week ſince I have heard from Belmont; not a line from Emily Howard, or Lady Anne; the unhappy have few friends; Lord Melvin is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of fortune; he has taken my place in their eſteem.</p>
               <p>The time is paſt, and my friend is not here, he has therefore no letters from Lord Belmont; I rated his diſintereſtedneſs too

               <p>Yet am I not too raſh? May not ſome accident have retarded my friend? I will wait patiently till evening; I cannot believe Lord Belmont—May he not have ſeen me, and ſuſpecting ſome clandeſtine deſign—Yes, my folly has undone me; what can he think of ſuch a concealment—</p>

Lady Julia is intended for Lord Melvin; the moſt ſplendid preparations are making; all is joy and feſtivity at Belmont; a wretch like me is below their thoughts; meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are hourly coming and going from Lord Rochdale's: it is paſt, and I am doomed to deſpair: my letter has only haſtened my deſtruction; has only haſtened this deteſted marriage: over-awed by pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal authority, ſhe gives me up, ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries another: ſhe has forgot her vows, thoſe vows which ſhe called on Heaven to witneſs: I have loſt all for which life was worth my care.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>Great God! to what a ſcene have I been witneſs! How ſhall I relate the ſhocking particulars?</p>
               <p>Lady Julia and I were advanced about a quarter of a mile from the houſe, bleſſing Providence, and talking of the dear hope of future happy days; ſhe was owning her paſſion with bluſhes, and all the tremor of modeſt ſenſibility, when we were interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the claſhing of ſwords behind ſome trees near us; we turned our heads, and ſaw Lord Melvin, diſtraction in his air, his ſword bloody, ſupporting Harry Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0276901102:147"/>
pale, bleeding, motionleſs, and to all appearance in the agonies of death. Lady Julia gave a ſhriek, and fell ſenſeleſs in my arms. My cries brought ſome of the ſervants, who happened to be near; part of them, with Lord Melvin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed Harry to the houſe; whilſt the reſt ſtaid with me to take care of Lady Julia.</p>
               <p>Harry was ſcarce out out of ſight when ſhe recovered her ſenſes; ſhe looked wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the place where ſhe firſt ſaw him, then ſtarting from me, raiſing her eyes to Heaven, her hands claſped together—Oh, Bellville! never ſhall I loſe the idea of that image of horror and deſpair—ſhe neither ſpoke nor ſhed a tear—there was an eager wildneſs in her look, which froze my ſoul with terror: ſhe advanced haſtily towards the houſe, looking round her every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if expecting again to ſee him, till having exhauſted all her ſtrength, ſhe ſunk down breathleſs on one of the ſeats, where I ſupported her till my Lord's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0276901102:148"/>
which I had ſent for, came up, in which I placed myſelf by her, and we drove ſlowly towards the houſe: ſhe was put to-bed in a burning fever, preceded by a ſhivering, which gives me apprehenſions for her, which I endeavor to conceal from the wretched parents, whoſe ſorrows mock all deſcription.</p>
               <p>My Lord is juſt come from Lord Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, who inſiſted on being his priſoner, till Harry was out of danger; diſdaining to fly from juſtice, ſince my Lord refuſes his ſtay at Belmont, he intreats to be given into the hands of ſome gentleman near. My Lord has accepted this offer, and named his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord Rochdale for the truſt. He is gone under the beſt guard, his own honor, in which Lord Belmont has implicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
               <p>I have been into Lady Julia's room; ſhe takes no notice of any thing. Emily
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0276901102:149"/>
Howard kneels weeping by her bedſide. Lady Belmont melts my ſoul when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her; ſhe ſits motionleſs as the ſtatue of deſpair; ſhe holds the hand of her love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daughter between hers, ſhe preſſes it to her boſom, and the tears ſteal ſilently down her cheeks.</p>
               <p>Unable to bear the ſight, I am returned to my apartment.</p>
               <p>Oh, Bellville! How is this ſcene of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs changed? Where are now the gay tranſporting hopes which warmed our hearts this morning?</p>
               <p>I have with difficulty prevailed on Lady Mary, who droops under this weight of affliction, and whoſe years are ill ſuited to ſcenes of horror, to ſet out this evening for her own ſeat; my niece, whoſe ſorrow you may eaſily imagine, is to accompany her thither: if Mr. Mandeville dies, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0276901102:150"/>
by the hand of him with whoſe fate hers is connected, never muſt ſhe again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe hoſpitable doors.</p>
               <p>Bellville! how is the gay ſtructure of ideal happineſs fallen in one moment to the ground!</p>
               <p>The meſſenger who was ſent to Lord T—'s is returned, and has brought my Lord's letter; he went from thence to Mr. Herbert's, where Mr. Mandeville was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be, but found nobody there but a ſervant, from whom he could get no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. The family had been gone five days to London, being ſent for expreſs to a relation who was dying.</p>
               <p>Oh Bellville! how many accidents have conſpired—I myſelf have innocently contributed to this dreadful event, miſled by my Lord's equivocal expreſſions, which ſeemed to point ſo plainly at Lord Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin—If

of giving her to him, and of the whole plan of purpoſed happineſs, which his impatience, irritated by a ſeries of unforeſeen accidents, had ſo fatally deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Till now he had appeared perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; but from the moment my Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak, a wildneſs had appeared in his countenance, which roſe before he ended to little leſs than diſtraction; he raved, he reproached Heaven itſelf; then melting into tears, prayed with fervor unſpeakable for Lady Julia's recovery: the agitation of his mind cauſed his wounds to bleed afreſh; ſucceſſive faintings were the conſequence, in one of which he expired.</p>
               <p>Lord Belmont is now writing to Colonel Mandeville. How many has this dreadful event involved in miſery!</p>
               <p>Who ſhall tell this to Lady Julia, yet how conceal it from her? I dread the moſt

fatal effects from her deſpair, when return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſon makes her capable of knowing her own wretchedneſs; at preſent ſhe is in a ſtate of perfect inſenſibility; her fever is not the leaſt abated; ſhe has every ſymptom which can indicate danger. Lady Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont and Emily Howard have never left her bedſide a moment. I have with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty perſuaded them to attempt to reſt a few hours, and am going to take Lady Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont's place by her bedſide.</p>

               <p>The phyſician is gone; he thinks Lady Julia in danger, but has not told this to the family: I am going again to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſhe has not yet taken notice of any body.</p>
               <p>I had been about half an hour in Lady Julia's room, when, having ſent the laſt attendant away for ſomething I wanted, ſhe looked round, and ſaw we were alone;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0276901102:159"/>
ſhe half raiſed herſelf in the bed, and graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hand, fixed her enquiring eyes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently on mine. I too well underſtood their meaning, and unable to hide my grief, was riſing to leave the bedſide, when catching hold of me, with a look and air which froze my ſoul; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Lady Anne, ſaid ſhe, does he live?"</q> My ſilence, and the tears which I could not conceal, explained to her the fatal truth, when raiſing her ſtreaming eyes and ſupplicating hands to heaven—Oh Bellville! no words can deſcribe the exceſs of her ſorrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; fearful of the moſt fatal inſtant ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I was obliged to call her attendants, of whoſe entrance ſhe took not the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. After remaining ſome time abſorbed in an agony of grief, which took from her all power of utterance, and made her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to all around her, the tears which ſhe ſhed in great abundance, ſeemed to give her relief: my heart was melted, I wept with her: ſhe ſaw my tears, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0276901102:160"/>
preſſing my hand tenderly between hers, ſeemed to thank me for the part I took in her afflictions: I had not oppoſed the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of her deſpair; but when I ſaw it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding, endeavored to ſoothe her with all the tender attention, and endearing ſympathy of faithful friendſhip; which ſo far ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, that I have left her more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed than I could have imagined it poſſible ſhe ſhould ſo ſoon have been; ſhe has even an appearance of tranquillity which amazes me; and ſeeming inclined to take reſt, I have left her for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>May Heaven reſtore her to her wretched parents, whoſe life is wrapt in hers! May it inſpire her with courage to bear this ſtroke, the ſevereſt a feeling mind can ſuffer. Her youth, her ſweetneſs of temper, her unaffected piety, her filial tenderneſs, ſometimes flatter me with a hope of her recovery; but when I think on that melting ſenſibility, on that exquiſitely tender heart,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0276901102:161"/>
which bleeds for the ſorrow of every human being, I give way to all the horrors of deſpair.</p>
               <p>Lady Julia has ſent to ſpeak with me: I will not a moment delay attending her. How bleſt ſhould I be if the ſympathizing boſom of Friendſhip could ſoften by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking her ſorrows!</p>
               <p>Oh Bellville! what a requeſt has ſhe made! my blood runs back at the idea.</p>
               <p>She received me with a compoſed air, begged me to ſit down by her bedſide, and ſending away her attendants, ſpoke as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You are, I doubt not, my dear Lady Anne, ſurprized at the ſeeming tranquil manner in which I bear the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all misfortunes—Yes, my heart doated on him, my love for him was unutterable—But it is paſt; I can no longer be deceived by the fond deluſion

               <p>This dreadful viſit is yet unpaid: three times ſhe approached the door, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as often to her apartment, unable to enter the room; the third time ſhe fainted away: her little remaining ſtrength being exhauſted, ſhe has conſented to defer her

               <p>I have been enquiring at Lady Julia's door; ſhe is in a ſweet ſleep, from which we have every thing to hope: I fly to tell this to Lady Belmont.—She will live; Heaven has heard our prayers.—</p>

                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0276901102:166"/>
We found her ſtill in a gentle ſleep, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at that of an infant; we approached the bed; Dr. Evelin took her hand, he ſtood ſome time looking on her with the moſt fixed attention, when, on my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my hopes from her ſleep, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Madam,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"it is with horror I tell you, that ſleep will probably be her laſt; nature is worn out and ſeeks a momentary repoſe before her laſt dreadful ſtruggle."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Not able to bear this, I left the room.—Bellville! is it poſſible! Can Heaven thus overwhelm with affliction, the beſt, the nobleſt of its creatures? Shall the amiable, the reverend pair, the buſineſs of whoſe lives has been to make others happy, be doomed in age to bear the ſevereſt of all ſorrows?

Dr. Evelin is now with the wretched parents, breaking to them the danger of their child: I dread ſeeing them after this interview; yet he will not ſure plunge them at once into deſpair.</p>
               <p>She is awake; I have been with her: her looks are greatly changed: her lips have a dying paleneſs; there is a dimneſs in her eyes which alarms me: ſhe has deſired to ſpeak a moment with Dr. Evelin; ſhe would know how long he thinks it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe may live.</p>

She felt her approaching diſſolution, of which ſhe had been warned, at her own ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſt, by Dr Evelin; ſhe ſummoned us all to her apartment; ſhe embraced us with the moſt affecting tenderneſs; ſhe called me to her, and giving me her pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for Col.

               <p>She begged forgiveneſs of her wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parents, for the only inſtance in which ſhe had ever forgot her duty, and for which ſhe now ſo ſeverely ſuffered: entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſubmit to the hand of Heaven, and not give way to immoderate affliction; to conſider that, if they were about to loſe a child, thouſands were at that moment ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering under the ſame diſtreſs; that death

was the common portion of humanity, from which youth was not more exempt than age; that their ſeparation was only temporary whilſt their re-union would be eternal: then, raiſing her blameleſs hands, prayed fervently to Heaven for them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored their laſt bleſſing; and turning to her agonizing mother, ſpeechleſs with exceſs of ſorrow, conjured her to reflect on the paſt goodneſs of Heaven, and the many years of happineſs ſhe had already paſt with the beſt of men, that this was the firſt misfortune ſhe had ever known; then embracing her fondly, weeping on her neck, and thanking her for all her goodneſs, preſſed her to her boſom, and expired.</p>
               <p>Let me draw a veil over the enſuing ſcene, to which words cannot do juſtice. With difficulty have we forced Lady Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont from the body.

Sinking under his own diſtreſs, and unable to ſupport the ſight of hers, my Lord is retired to his apartment. May Heaven look with pity on them both, and enable them to bear this blow to all their hopes!</p>

               <p>How perſuaſive is ſuch a preacher! I gaze on that once matchleſs form, and all vanity dies within me: who was ever love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like her, yet ſhe lies before me a clod of ſenſeleſs clay; thoſe eyes, which once gave

love to every beholder, are now robbed of their living luſtre; that beauteous boſom is cold as the marble on the ſilent tomb; the roſes of thoſe cheeks are faded; thoſe vermillion lips, from whence truth and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ever proceeded—Bellville, the ſtarting tears—I cannot go on—</p>
               <p>Look here, ye proud and be humble! which of you all can vie with her? Youth, health, beauty, birth, riches, all that men call good were hers: all are now of no a vail; virtue alone bids defiance to the grave.</p>
               <p>Great Heaven! Colonel Mandeville is at the gate; he knows not the cup of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which awaits him; he cannot yet have received my Lord's letter.

               <p>YOUR letter, my dear Bellville, gave me all the conſolation it is poſſible to receive amidſt ſuch a ſcene of wretchedneſs and deſpair; the tender ſympathy of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying friendſhip is the beſt balm for every woe.</p>
               <p>The delicacy with which you decline mentioning a ſubject ſo improper for the time, would encreaſe my eſteem for you, if that was poſſible. I know the goodneſs, the tender ſenſibility of your heart, too well to doubt your approving my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give ſix months to the memory of my angelic friend, and the ſad taſk of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to ſoften the ſorrows of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Her dying voice adjured me not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0276901102:177"/>
to leave them to their deſpair: I will not forget the ſad taſk her friendſhip impoſed.</p>
               <p>The agony of Lady Belmont's grief begins to give place to a ſorrow more reaſonable, though, perhaps, not leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. The violence of her emotions abate; ſhe ſtills weeps, but her air is more calm; ſhe raiſes her eyes to Heaven, but it is with a look of patient reſignation, which, whilſt it melts my ſoul to behold, gives me hopes ſhe will not ſink under her afflictions; Lord Belmont ſtruggles with his own grief, leſt is ſhould encreaſe hers; he attempts to comfort her; he begs her, with an irreſolute air, to conſider the hand from whence the ſtroke proceeded; unable to go on, his voice trembles; his boſom ſwells with unutterable anguiſh; he riſes; he leaves the room; the tears trickle down his reverend cheeks.</p>

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0276901102:178"/>
Theſe, Bellville, theſe are the ſcenes I have perpetually before my eyes.</p>
               <p>Colonel Mandeville indulges his ſorrow alone; ſhut up continually in his apartment, a prey to ſilent diſtreſs, he ſeems to fly from all human converſe: if entreated, he joins our ſad party a moment, he enters with a dejected air, his eyes are bent ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to the ground; he ſits motionleſs, inattentive, abſorbed in reflexion on his own miſery; then ſtarting up exclaims, <q rend="inline">"All elſe I could have borne,"</q> and retires to give himſelf up to his deſpair.</p>
               <p>I am now convinced Emily Howard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that preference Lady Julia gave her over me in her heart, of which I once ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly complained; I lament, I regret, but am enough myſelf to reaſon, to reflect; Emily Howard can only weep.</p>
               <p>

Far from being conſoled for the loſs of her lovely friend, by the proſpect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting Lord Belmont's fortune, to which after Colonel Mandeville ſhe is intitled, ſhe ſeems incapable of taſting any good in life without her; every idea of happineſs her gentle mind could form included Lady Julia's friendſhip; with her ſhe wiſhed to ſpend all her days; ſhe was all to her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Emily; without her ſhe finds the world a deſart.</p>
               <p>She is changed beyond conception by her grief, a grief which has not a moment's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion: the almoſt dying paleneſs of her cheeks is a witneſs of the exceſs of her affliction; yet this very paleneſs has a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand charms; her diſtreſs has ſomething in it unſpeakably lovely; adorned by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſhe puts me in mind of what Young deſcribes woman in general;

               <p>Bellville, I have been walking in a little wilderneſs of flowering ſhrubs once pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly happy in Lady Julia's favor; there is a roſe which I ſaw planted by her hand; it ſtill flouriſhes in youthful bloom, whilſt ſhe, the faireſt flower Heaven ever formed, lies cropped by the cruel hand of Death.</p>
               <p>What force has the imagination over the ſenſes! How different is the whole face of nature in my eyes! The once ſmiling ſcene has a melancholy gloom, which ſtrikes a damp through my inmoſt ſoul: I look in vain for thoſe vivid beauties which once charmed me; all beauty died with Lady Julia.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0276901102:181"/>
In this ſpot, where we have ſo often walked together, I give way to all the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs of ſorrow; I recall thoſe happy days which are never to return; a thouſand tender ideas ruſh on my memory; I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thoſe dear moments of confidence and friendſhip engraved for ever on my heart; I ſtill hear the ſweet accents of that voice, ſtill behold that matchleſs form; I ſee her every moment before me, in all the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of youth and innocence; I ſee her parents gazing on her as ſhe paſſes, with that lively tranſport a parent only can know.</p>
               <p>It was here her riſing bluſhes firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to me the ſecret of her heart: it was here the lovelieſt of mankind firſt implored me to favor his paſſion for my ſweet friend.</p>
               <p>Pleaſed with the tender ſorrow which poſſeſſed all my ſoul, I determined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge it to the utmoſt; and revolving in my imagination the happy hours of chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0276901102:182"/>
friendſhip, to which that ſmiling ſcene had been witneſs, prolonged my walk till evening had, almoſt unperceived, ſpread its gloomy horrors round; till the varied tints of the flowers were loſt in the deepening ſhades of night.</p>
               <p>Awaking at once from the reverie in which I had been plunged, I found myſelf at a diſtance from the houſe, juſt entering the little wood ſo loved by my charming friend; the every moment encreaſing dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gave an awful gloom to the trees; I ſtopped, I looked round, not a human form was in ſight; I liſtened and heard not a ſound but the trembling of ſome pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the wood; I called, but the echo of my own voice was the only anſwer I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; a dreary ſilence reigned around, a terror I never felt before ſeized me, my heart panted with timid apprehenſion; I breathed ſhort, I ſtarted at every leaf that moved; my limbs were covered with a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0276901102:183"/>
a cold dew; I fancied I ſaw a thouſand airy forms flit around me, I ſeemed to hear the ſhrieks of the dead and dying; there is no deſcribing my horrors.</p>
               <p>At the moment when my fears had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deprived me of ſenſe, I ſaw Colonel Mandeville approach; I concealed from him the terrors of my ſoul, leſt they ſhould add to the ſorrow which conſumed him: he addreſſed me in a faltering voice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me to the houſe almoſt without ſpeaking, and leading me into the ſaloon—Oh Bellville! How ſhall I deſcribe what I felt on entering the room?</p>
               <p>Is not Death of itſelf ſufficiently dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that we thus clothe it in additional terrors, by the horrid apparatus with which we ſuffer it to be attended? The room was hung with black, lighted up to ſhow the affecting objects it contained, and in the midſt, in their coffins, the breathleſs bodies
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0276901102:184"/>
of the hapleſs lovers: on a couch near them, ſupported by Emily Howard, the wretched mother wringing her hands in all the agony of deſpair. Lord Belmont ſtanding by the bodies, looking at them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately, weeping over his child, and raiſing his deſponding eyes to Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the God of Mercy to relieve him from this load of miſery, and to put a ſpeedy period to that life which was now robbed of all its happineſs.</p>
               <p>I approached Lady Julia's coffin, I gazed eagerly on her angel countenance, ſerene as that of a ſleeping infant; I kiſſed her lifeleſs lips, which ſtill wore the ſmile of innocence and peace. Bellville, may my laſt end be like hers! May I meet her in the regions of immortality! Never ſhall I forget her gentle virtues, or the delight I found in her friendſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0276901102:185"/>
She was wrapped in a looſe robe of white ſattin: her head covered with a veil of gauſe: the village maids, who laid her in the coffin, had adorned herwith the freſheſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they ſtood at an awful diſtance, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hard fate and their own: they have entreated to watch around her this night, and to bear her to-morrow to the grave.</p>
               <p>I had ſtood ſome time looking on the dear remains of Lady Julia, when Colonel Mandeville took my hand, and leading me to the coffin in which his ſon's were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited; <q rend="inline">"Lady Anne, ſaid he, you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got your once favored friend, your once gay, once lovely Harry Mandeville. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all that Death has left of the darling of a fond parent's heart! The graces of that form are loſt, thoſe lips have ceaſed to utter the generous ſentiments of the nobleſt heart which ever beat; but never will his varied perfections be blotted from the mind of his father."</q>

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0276901102:186"/>
I approached the moſt lovely of men; the traces of ſorrow were viſible on his counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he died in the moment when he heard the happineſs which had been vainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for him. My tears ſtreamed afreſh when I beheld him, when I remembered the ſweet hours we had paſſed together, the gay ſcenes which hope had painted to our hearts; I wept over the friend I had ſo loved, I preſſed his cold hand to my lips.</p>
               <p>Bellville! I am now accuſtomed to horrors.</p>
               <p>We have prevailed on the wretched parents to retire: Emily Howard and I, have entreated to watch our angel friends till midnight, and then leave them to the village maids, to whom Lady Julia's weeping attendants inſiſt on being joined.</p>
               <p>I dread the riſing of to-morrow's ſun; he was meant to light us to happineſs.</p>

               <p>I Am juſt come from chapel with Lady Belmont, who has been pouring out the ſorrows of her ſoul to her Creator, with a fervor of devotion which a mind like hers alone can feel: when ſhe approached the ſeat once filled by Lady Julia, the tears ſtreamed involuntarily down her cheeks; ſhe wiped them away, ſhe raiſed her eyes to Heaven, and falling on her knees, with a look of pious reſignation, ſeemed to ſacrifice her grief to her god, or at leaſt to ſuſpend the expreſſion of it in his preſence.</p>
               <p>Next Sunday ſhe goes to the pariſh church, where the angelic pair are interred; I dread her ſeeing the vault, yet think ſhe cannot too ſoon viſit every place which muſt renew the exceſs of her affliction; ſhe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0276901102:191"/>
will then, and not till then, find, by degrees, the violence of her ſorrow ſubſide, and give way to that pleaſing melancholy, that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regret, which, however ſtrange it may appear, is one of the moſt charming ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the human heart.</p>
               <p>Whether it be that the mind abhors no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a ſtate of inaction, or from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſe I know not, but grief itſelf is more agreeable to us than indifference; nay, if not too exquiſite, is in the higheſt degree delightful; of which the pleaſure we take in tragedy, or in talking of our dead friends, is a ſtriking proof; we wiſh not to be cured of what we feel on theſe occaſions; the tears we ſhed are charming, we even indulge in them; Bellville, does not the very word <hi>indulge</hi> ſhew the ſenſation to be pleaſureable?</p>
               <p>I have juſt now a letter from my niece; ſhe is in deſpair at this dreadful event; ſhe ſees the amiable, the venerable parents, whoſe happineſs was the ardent wiſh of her
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0276901102:192"/>
ſoul, and from whom ſhe had received every proof of eſteem and friendſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the extremeſt miſery, by the hand of him ſhe loves: for ever excluded from Belmont, for ever to them an object of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſhe ſeems to herſelf guilty of their wretchedneſs, ſhe ſeems to have ſtruck the fatal blow.</p>
               <p>Since Mr. Mandeville's death ſhe has left Lady Mary, whoſe tears ſhe fancied were redoubled at her ſight.</p>
               <p>Nor is ſhe leſs wretched on Lord Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's account, ſhe is diſtracted with her terrors for his life, which is however ſafe by Mr. Mandeville's generous care, who when expiring gave teſtimony to his innocence.</p>
               <p>You will oblige me by begging of Lady Betty to take her at preſent under her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: it ill ſuits the delicacy of her ſex and birth to remain in London alone
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0276901102:193"/>
and unconnected: with your amiable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe cannot fail of being happy.</p>
               <p>I had perſwaded Lady Belmont to walk in the garden, ſhe went with me, leaning on my arm, when the door being opened the firſt object that ſtruck her ſight was the pavillion raiſed for the marriage of her daughter, which none of us had thought of having removed.</p>
               <p>She ſtarted, ſhe returned haſtily to her apartment, and throwing herſelf on a couch, gave a looſe to all the anguiſh of her ſoul.</p>
               <p>Bellville, every object ſhe meets will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind her of the darling of her heart.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Colonel Mandeville are together, they are projecting a tomb for their lovely children: a tomb worthy the ardour of their own parental affection; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to perpetuate the memory of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

our loſt child will be ever at our hearts: when I remember her filial ſweetneſs, her angel virtues, her matchleſs perfections—the only view we had in life was to ſee her happy: that is paſt, and all is now a dreary wild before us; time may blunt the keen edge of ſorrow, and enable us to bear the load of life with patience; but never muſt we hope the return of peace.</p>
            <p>The ſhortneſs of life, and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how much of our own is paſt, are the only conſolations we can receive: it cannot be long before we rejoin our beloved child: we have only to pray for that ardently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected hour which will re-unite us to all we love.</p>
            <p>Why will man lay ſchemes of laſting felicity? By an over ſolicitude to continue my family and name, and ſecure the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my child, I have defeated my own purpoſe, and fatally deſtroyed both.</p>
            <p>

Humbled in the duſt, I confeſs the hand of Heaven: the pride of birth, the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of my houſe, had too great a ſhare in my reſolves!</p>
            <p>Oh, my friend! but I conſider the hand which directed the blow, and ſubmit to the will of my God.</p>

            <head>To Colonel BELLVILLE.</head>

            <p>I AM deſired by my Lord to aſk you hither, and to beg you will bring my niece with you. Lady Belmont joins in the requeſt; her nobleneſs of ſentiment has conquered the reluctance ſhe had to ſee her; ſhe has even promiſed to endeavor to bear the ſight of Lord Melvin, but I fear this is more than is in her power; ſhe fainted when the requeſt was firſt made. Lady Mary is expected here this evening.</p>
            <p>Bellville, you are coming to Belmont, once the ſmiling paradice of friendſhip, Alas! how changed from that once happy abode! Where are thoſe blameleſs pleaſures, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivialjoy, thoſe ſweet follies, which once gave ſuch charms to this place? For ever gone,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0276901102:204"/>
for ever changed to a gloomy ſadneſs, for ever buried with Lady Julia.</p>
            <p>Lady Belmont ſtruggles nobly with her grief; ſhe has conſented to ſee her friends, to ſee all who will hear her talk of her child: a tender melancholy has taken place of thoſe horrors, which it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible long to ſupport and live.</p>
            <p>Colonel Mandeville is to ſtay at Belmont, they are to indulge in all the voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſorrow; they are to ſit all day and talk of their matchleſs children, and count the hours till they follow them to the grave. They have invited all who will join in tears with them; the coach is gone to-day for Mr. and Mrs. Herbert.</p>
            <p>Emily Howard and I bend our whole thoughts to find out means to ſoften their ſorrows; I hope much from your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the endearing ſenſibility of your ſoul; it is not by reſiſting, but by ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0276901102:205"/>
grief, that we muſt heal the wounded heart.</p>
            <p>There is one pleaſure to which they can never be inſenſible, the pleaſure of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſeries of others: to divert their attention from the ſad objects which now engroſs them, we muſt find out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats of wretchedneſs; we muſt point out diſtreſs which it is in their power to alleviate.</p>
            <p>Oh, Bellville! But in vain does the pride of human wiſdom ſeek to explore the counſels of the Moſt High! Certain of the paternal care of our Creator, our part is ſubmiſſion to his will.</p>
