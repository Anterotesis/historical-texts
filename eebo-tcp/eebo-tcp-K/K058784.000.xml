            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But thoſe, Sir, are not the reaſons I ſhall aſſign for not replying to Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s full Anſwer. The true reaſon is, that he ſeems at bottom a facetious man, who under the colour of an opponent writes on my ſide of the Queſtion, and really believes no more than I do of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Doctrine about Fluxions, which he expoſes, contradicts, and confutes with great skill and humour, under the maſque of a grave vindication.</p>

               <p>II.

It muſt be owned, in an Age of ſo much ludicrous humour, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one can at firſt ſight diſcern a Writer's real deſign.

in the Affirmative, and very weak and puzzled in the argumentative Parts of your Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance?

How ſucceſsfully Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> hath practiſed theſe Arts, and how much to the honour of the great Client he would ſeem to take under his protection, I ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly examine throughout every Article of his full Anſwer.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <p>IV. FIRST then, ſaith Mr. <hi>Walton,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">I am to be asked, whether I can conceive Velocity without Motion, or Motion without Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Extenſion without Magnitude?</q> To which he anſwereth in poſitive Terms, that he can conceive Velocity and Motion in a Point (<hi>P.</hi> 7). And to make out this, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to demonſtrate, <q rend="inline">that if a thing be moved by an Agent operating continually with the ſame force, the Velocity will not be the ſame in any two different Points of the deſcribed Space. But that it muſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0220200700:7"/>
upon the leaſt change of Space.</q> Now admitting thus much to be demonſtrated, yet I am ſtill at a loſs to perceive, how Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s Concluſion will follow, to wit, <q rend="inline">that I am greatly miſtaken in imagining there can be no Motion, no Velocity in a Point of Space</q> (<hi>P.</hi> 10). Pray, Sir, conſider his Reaſoning. The ſame Velocity cannot be in two Points of Space; therefore Velocity can be in a Point of Space. Would it not be juſt as good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning to ſay, the ſame man cannot be in two Nutſhels; therefore a Man can be in a Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel? Again, Velocity muſt vary upon the leaſt change of Space; therefore there may be Velocity without Space. Make Senſe of this if you can. What have theſe Conſequences to do with their Premiſes? Who but Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> could have inferred them? Or how could even he have inferred them, had it not been in jeſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <p>V. SUPPOSE the Center of a falling Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deſcribe a Line, divide the time of its Fall into equal Parts, for inſtance into minutes. The Spaces deſcribed in thoſe equal parts of Time will be unequal. That is, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0220200700:8"/>
Points of the deſcribed Line you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a minute's deſcent, you will ſtill find it a different Space. This is true. But how or why from this plain truth a Man ſhould infer, that Motion can be conceived in a Point, is to me as obſcure as any the moſt obſcure myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that occur in this profound Author. Let the Reader make the beſt of it. For my Part, I can as eaſily conceive Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> ſhould walk without ſtirring, as I can his Idea of Motion without Space. After all, the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not whether Motion could be proved to exiſt in a Point, but only whether it could be conceived in a Point. For, as to the proof of things impoſſible, ſome men have a way of proving that may equally prove any thing. But I much queſtion whether any Reader of common Senſe will undertake to conceive what this pleaſant Man at Inference undertakes to prove.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <p>VI. IF Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> really meant to defend the Author of the Fluxionary Method, would he not have done it in a Way conſiſtent with this illuſtrious Author's own Principles? Let us now ſee what may be Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Notion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0220200700:9"/>
about this matter. He diſtinguiſheth two ſorts of motion, abſolute and relative. The former he defineth to be a Tranſlation from abſolute place to abſolute place, the latter from one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative place to another. <note n="*" place="bottom">See <bibl>
                        <hi>Schol. def. viii. Philoſ. Nat. Princip. Math.</hi>

                  </note> Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s is plainly neither of theſe ſorts of Motion, but ſome third kind, which what it is, I am at a loſs to comprehend. But I can clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that, if we admit Motion without Space, then Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Account of it muſt be wrong: For place by which he defines Motion is, according to him, a part of Space. And if ſo, then this notable Defender hath cut out new Work for himſelf to defend and explain. But about this, if I miſtake not, he will be very eaſy. For, as I ſaid before, he ſeems at bottom a back Friend to that great Man; which Opinion you will ſee further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Sequel.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="section">
               <p>VII. I SHALL no more ask Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> to explain any thing. For I can honeſtly ſay, the more he explains, the more I am puzzled. But I will ask his Readers to explain, by what Art a Man may conceive Motion without
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0220200700:10"/>
Space. And ſuppoſing this to be done, in the ſecond place to explain, how it conſiſts with Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Account of Motion. Is it not evident, that Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> hath deſerted from his old Maſter, and been at ſome pains to expoſe him, while he defends one Part of his Principles by overturning another? Let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reader tell me, what Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> means by Motion, or if he can gueſs, what this third kind is, which is neither abſolute nor relative, which exiſts in a Point, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd without Space. This learned Profeſſor ſaith, <q rend="inline">I have no clear Conception of the Principles of Motion</q> (<hi>P.</hi> 24). And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place (<hi>P.</hi> 7.) he ſaith,  <q rend="inline">I might have conceived Velocity in a Point, if I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and conſidered the nature of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> I believe I am not alone in not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Principles.

               <p>VIII. BEING now ſatisfied, that Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s aim is not to clear up or defend Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Principles, but rather to contradict and expoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0220200700:11"/>

And if the Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of naſcent and evaneſcent Quantities, <hi>i. e.</hi> abſtracted from time and ſpace, may not be comprehended, how can we comprehend and demonſtrate their Proportions? or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their <hi>rationes primae &amp; ultimae.</hi> For to conſider the Proportion or Ratio of Things implieth that ſuch Things have Magnitude: That ſuch their Magnitudes may be meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Relations to each other known. But, as there is no meaſure of Velocity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Time and Space, the proportion of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities being only compounded of the direct proportion of the Spaces and the reciprocal Proportion of the Times; doth it not follow,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0220200700:12"/>
that to talk of inveſtigating, obtaining, and conſidering the proportions of Velocities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively of Time and Space, is to talk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligibly?</q> Apply now, as I ſaid, Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s full Anſwer and you will ſoon find how fully you are enlightened about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fluxions.</p>

            <div n="9" type="section">
               <p>IX. IN the following Article of Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s full Anſwer, he ſaith divers curious things, which, being derived from this ſame Principle, that motion may be conceived in a point, are altogether as incomprehenſible as the Origine from whence they flow.

But admitting the Velocities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, yet how can any one conceive a Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular

Surface to be produced from a line mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by Velocity, otherwiſe than by ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch line multiplied by a line or Increment, which ſhall be exponent of or proportional to ſuch Velocity? You may try to conceive it otherwiſe. I muſt own I cannot. Is not the Increment of a Rectangle it ſelf a Rectangle? muſt not then <hi>Ab</hi> and <hi>Ba</hi> be Rectangles? and muſt not the Coefficients or Sides of Rectangles be lines? conſequently are not <hi>b</hi> and <hi>a</hi> lines or (which is the ſame thing) Increments of lines? theſe Increments may indeed be conſidered as proportional to and exponents of Velocity. But excluſive of ſuch exponents to talk of Rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles under lines and velocities is, I conceive, to talk unintelligibly. And yet this is what Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> doth, when he maketh <hi>b</hi> and <hi>a</hi> in the Rectangles <hi>Ab</hi> and <hi>Ba</hi> to denote mere Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>

And yet we may often obſerve, that the exponents of Fluxions or notes repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fluxions are confounded with the Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions themſelves.
