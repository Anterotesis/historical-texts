            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am very Senſible of the Reſpect
that is due to the Profeſſion, and
Character of the Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
againſt <hi>Inoculating the Small
Pox</hi>; but am no leſs ſenſible of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
I lye under to vindicate my own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
which a violent Fit of Sickneſs
hath hitherto hinder'd me from doing. And
I can do it with the more Freedom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am conſcious to my ſelf, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
this Practice in <hi>England</hi> with the ſame
View to the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> with which, I
hope, the Learned Author condemns it. I
muſt take the Liberty to ſay, that allowing
the Doctor's Abilities to be as great as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in his own Profeſſion, he ſeems not
quite ſo well qualify'd to write upon this
Subject; becauſe of the Narrowneſs of his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0090401000:5"/>
Experience (as far as appears by his Letter)
and his partial Credulity, or Incredulity in
Matters of Fact, which he takes from others;
and laſtly, becauſe of ſtrong Prejudices, which
impoſe upon his moſt excellent Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and draw him into Reaſonings, which
either are inconſequential, or conclude
ſtrongly for the Practice of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> which
they are brought to overturn. All theſe, I
believe, will appear very plain to any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Reader, in the following <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,</hi>
in which I will endeavour to be
as ſhort as the Subject will allow.</p>
            <p>The Letter pretends to be an Admonition
to Phyſicians not to meddle in this Practice
of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> 'till they are better aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
by Experience, of the Succeſs of it:
At the ſame Time, it is a moſt warm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive,
not only to Phyſicians, but to all
Sorts of People, not to practiſe it at all;
and conſequently, to deprive them of all
Poſſibility of coming by Experience. Would
it not found ſomewhat abſurd, if any one
ſhould ſay to a young Phyſician, Pray, Sir,
don't Practiſe 'till you have Experience? But
it is ſtill more ſo in this Caſe, becauſe in
a Practice that is entirely to be laid aſide,
you can neither have the Benefit of your
own, nor other Peoples Experience.</p>
            <p>As to Phyſicians meddling with this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> I can only ſay, it may
favour too much of Novelty to be bigotly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0090401000:6"/>
zealous for it; and too much of a Faculty-Intereſt
to be ſo violent againſt it. Phyſicians
cannot ingraft People againſt their own, or
their Parents Conſent; and a Phyſician would
be out of his Duty, who ſhould perſuade them
to it contrary to their Inclinations: On the
other Hand, If a Perſon, from the Experience
of the Fatality of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or in his own Family in particular,
ſhould reſolve to ingraft his Child, any
Phyſician, who ſhould diſſuade him from it,
might, in a great meaſure, be chargeable
with the fatal Conſequences of the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of a Method, which the Parent had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
as the only Moans to ſave his Child's
Life: And he would be ſtill as much to
blame, if when the Parent had reſolv'd to
ingraft his Child, he ſhould refuſe to attend
him. It is very common with Parents, not
only to leave their Children in Houſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> but to bring
them into the Room, where their Brethren
or Siſters lye ill of them; and a Parent who
does ſo, conveys the Infection to his Child
as deliberately, and according to the Doctor,
certainly more than he, who orders him to be
<hi>Inoculated.</hi> Would it not then be equally,
impertinent in the Phyſician to deny his
Attendance in either Caſe?</p>
            <p>I muſt put the Doctor in Mind, that there
are very few of the moſt uſeful Diſcoveries
in Phyſick, that have not been ſtrenuouſly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0090401000:7"/>
oppos'd by many of the Faculty upon their
firſt Appearance. There is extant a Decree
of the College of Phyſicians at <hi>Paris,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Uſe of Antimonial Vomits: It
were eaſy to aſſign many Inſtances of the
like Nature.</p>
            <p>As the Doctor is ſurpriz'd, <hi>that an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
practis'd only by a few ignorant
Women, amongſt an illiterate and unthinking
People, ſhould on a Sudden, and upon a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Experience, ſo far obtain in one of the
Politeſt Nations in the World, as to be receiv'd
into the Royal Palace.</hi> I hope he has not
forgot, that the Practice of Curing Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Fevers by the BARK, was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
of a Sudden, by a barbarous <hi>Indian,</hi>
if not into the Royal Family, into the Family
of a Viceroy; and thence tranſmitted to us.</p>
            <p>Page 7.] The <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh if
we ſpeak of it as National, is the Product
of the richeſt Dyet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> to bring 'em
to a ſpare Dyet before they have the <hi>Small
Pox,</hi> muſt be extremely dangerous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
This muſt be the Doctor's Concluſion:
mine, I own, would be the direct contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
If the Inflammatory State of the Blood,
ariſing from the Richneſs of the Dyet, makes
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in <hi>England</hi> very mortal; That
Practice, which either takes the Advantage
of a contrary State of the Blood, or by a
Spare Dyet introduces it, muſt be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0090401000:8"/>
Page 8.] <hi>The fineſt, the moſt Volatile, and
indeed, Inſenſible Particles of the Animal
Juices, are the moſt penetrating, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the moſt contagious.</hi> And for the
ſame Reaſon, the moſt <hi>noxious:</hi> Does it
follow therefore, To convey the Infection
by the groſſer and ſenſible Parts, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
unfit and dangerous? I confeſs, I
ſhould have inferr'd the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Symptoms are more or leſs, and the
Diſtemper appears in a greater, or a leſs
Degree, according to the State of the Blood
at the Time of Infection.</hi> Therefore the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Inoculation</hi> is highly to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
becauſe it either finds, or puts the
Blood into a good State, before the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
ſeems to be a more natural Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
than the contrary One.</p>
            <p>Page 10.] <hi>If we could be aſſur'd, that the
Diſtemper would not be equally uncertain by</hi>
Inoculation, <hi>according to the Nature of the
Injected Matter, or the Diſpoſition of the
Fluids, in the Perſon who receives it; ſo
that it would conſtantly prove of the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Kind,</hi> Inoculation <hi>would, no doubt, be
a very rational and uſeful Practice.</hi> The
Doctor ſurely will not affirm, that a Perſon
<hi>Inoculated</hi> is equally uncertain of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
mention'd, with one who catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by the common Way of
Infection. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He may be aſſur'd, if the
<hi>Inoculation</hi> takes Place, of the Time when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0090401000:9"/>
he ſhall have the <hi>Small Pox. Secondly,</hi> That
he has not the Infection by the inſenſible
Particles, which the Doctor owns to be the
moſt contagious; or which is near the ſame
Thing, convey the Contagion the ſtrongeſt,
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> He may be as ſure, as his Operator
is careful, that he is infected by a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Kind. And, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He may be much
more ſure of the Diſpoſition of his Fluids,
than a Perſon who catches them by Chance,
after a Surfeit, or a Debauch: And after all
this, he may be aſſur'd, if he has not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Certainty, (which, I believe, one has
hardly in Blood-letting) that he has a much
greater Probability to eſcape, which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Ground for human Prudence to act
upon: If the Doctor will deny thoſe Things,
I think it is Folly to reaſon upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
any longer: And if, as the Doctor ſays,
Inoculation <hi>may be a more uncertain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to give the Contagion, than that which
Nature has purſu'd</hi>; it may be, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that, much more ſafe.</p>
            <p>Page 11.] <hi>The very Choice that is made
of a thick purulent Matter, to intermix im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
with the Blood, ſeems a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to our Reaſon, ſince we know, that
the Particles have ſuch a different Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſuch different Powers to Attract.</hi>
It may proceed from my Ignorance, or Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but, I confeſs, I do not eaſily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Meaning of this Sentence; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0090401000:10"/>
by <hi>the Particles</hi> he means the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of purulent Matter, or the Particles of
Blood; or whether the Particles of purulent
Matter have different attractive Powers, from
thoſe of the Blood, is not obvious from the
Conſtruction of the Sentence. I chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to underſtand him in the laſt Senſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has afterwards very ſagaciouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
<hi>That the blended Particles of Blood
with Blood, may, in all Reaſon, be thought
more likely to unite, and leſs liable to raiſe
Commotions.</hi> But it happens unluckily in the
Caſe of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> the Deſign is to <hi>raiſe a
Commotion</hi>; and the purulent Matter, for
the Reaſon mention'd by him, is fitteſt for
that Purpoſe; And his Obſervation, that <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Medicines injected into the Blood will
Purge,</hi> does not prove, that the <hi>Pus</hi> of the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> mix'd with the Blood, may not
raiſe the <hi>Small Pox.</hi> What he ſays in this
Paragraph, as likewiſe in the following, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Experiment of the <hi>Mangey Dog,</hi>
proves, that <hi>Pus</hi> is a more proper Vehicle
to convey Infection than Blood; I cannot
find any more in it.</p>
            <p>Page 13.] <hi>It never came into the Heads</hi>
of the Practitioners above-mention'd <hi>to raiſe
Diſtempers by Art in a human Body.</hi> Then
I will be bold to ſay, it never came into
their Heads to practiſe Phyſick; which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
in a true Light, is founded upon that
ſingle Principle of Curing <hi>Natural,</hi> by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0090401000:11"/>
               <hi>Artificial Diſeaſes.</hi> What is Bleeding,
but an artificial Haemorrhagy; Purging, but
raiſing an artificial Diarrhaea? Does the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
produc'd by a Surfeit, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
by a Medicine differ ſo much, as that
the One muſt be call'd a Diſeaſe, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not? Are not Bliſters, Iſſues, and Setons,
artificial <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Impoſthumations? I hope he has
not forgot the of his great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Hippocrates.</hi> The Wounds and Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Surgeons, differ only from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Ones, by the Manner and Intention;
<hi>Morbus eſt ille corporis ſtatus qui functiones
Animales laedit:</hi> And it may be likewiſe
obſerv'd, that Phyſicians produce thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
in their Patients often by Way of
Prevention as well as Cure; and in this
they do nothing but imitate Nature, which
often attempts the Cure of one Diſeaſe by
another.</p>
            <p>Page 14.] His next Argument is taken
from <hi>the fatal Conſequences of this very
Matter it ſelf returning into the Blood, in
the very Height of the</hi> Small Pox, <hi>where
there ſeldom is a full and ſufficient Diſcharge
by the Skin,</hi> &amp;c. One would imagine, that
the natural Inference from this, would be
to the Advantage of <hi>Inoculation</hi>; For if
there are terrible Symptoms, which ariſe
from Want of a ſufficient Diſcharge of the
purulent Matter in the <hi>Small Pox</hi>; <hi>Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
which provides for ſuch a Diſcharge,

by artificial Out-lets, muſt needs be uſeful;
and ſeems more proper than the Bliſters,
which the Phyſicians apply on that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
As to the <hi>fatal Conſequences ariſing for
Want of a ſufficient Diſcharge upon the Skin,</hi>
I am affraid the Caſe is quite different from
what the Doctor repreſents; for the more
Matter is diſcharg'd upon the Skin, the more
is often return'd into the Blood; witneſs the
<hi>confluent</hi> Kind of <hi>Small Pox,</hi> where the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
upon the Skin, as well as the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
ariſing from the Return of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Blood, are both the greateſt:
And I believe it will be found, the leſs the
Diſcharge upon the Skin, the leſs will be
the Danger from theſe Symptoms. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
ſays, <hi>That one may always obſerve in
this artificial Method (even where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
is the faireſt and moſt kindly) that
the Puſtules ſcarce ever plump up to that
Degree, or contain ſo laudable a Matter, as
they do in the natural Sort.</hi> Here is an odd
Jumble of the Words <hi>always, ſcarce ever:</hi>
Suppoſe for <hi>ſcarce ever</hi> one put <hi>ſeldom,</hi> then
the Sentence runs thus; <hi>One may always
obſerve the Puſtules ſeldom plump up,</hi> &amp;c.
What happens but ſeldom, happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
and to obſerve <hi>always That</hi> not to
happen, which happens ſometimes, is odd,
or oddly expreſs'd. I would be glad to know
how many Caſes the Doctor has obſerv'd,
to frame this ſo general a Propoſition upon;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0090401000:13"/>
of the contrary of which, Hundreds of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
about this Town, who know the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
perfectly, have been Eye-Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Page 16.] The Doctor foreſees ſome Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
that muſt happen, from thoſe <hi>viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Particles</hi> intermixing with the Blood,
without undergoing the common Alterations
of Aliment. But they have that in common
with the <hi>Volatile</hi> and moſt <hi>Inſenſible Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
But then they are <hi>viſcid,</hi> and therefore,
(according to the Doctor's Reaſoning) don't
convey the Infection ſo ſtrong: But they <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
great Diſorders</hi>; Not ſo great as the
<hi>Inſenſible</hi> and <hi>Volatile Particles.</hi> At laſt,
they <hi>break through the Glands of the Skin:</hi>
If only the ſmall Quantity of purulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that mixes with the Blood, break thro'
the Pores of the Skin, the Eruption, indeed,
would be very ſmall; But to cauſe an Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is the very Intention of the Operation;
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> cannot be produc'd without
it: And if the Doctor ſtill inſiſts, that it is
<hi>only like the</hi> Small Pox; all I can ſay is, If
he had been pleas'd to attend Multitudes of
Caſes of <hi>Inoculated Perſons,</hi> here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in <hi>England,</hi> ſince this Practice began,
he muſt have been convinc'd, that the <hi>Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
produc'd by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> are the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Small Pox.</hi> If his Arguments ſo far
prevail, as to hinder any future <hi>Inoculation,</hi>
he muſt for ever continue in his Miſtake; If
the Patient recovers, then it was only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0090401000:14"/>
like the <hi>Small Pox</hi>; If any one dies,
then to be ſure it was the <hi>Small Pox</hi> catch'd
by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> and of the worſt Sort. In
this Paragraph it is no <hi>Small Pox</hi>; by and
by, it is a <hi>Small Pox</hi> ſo bad, that it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>ſpreading the</hi> Small Pox through <hi>a
whole City; and an artificial Way of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulating
a whole Country.</hi> This Way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
is a very plain Proof of the ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
the Doctor lyes under; and that as he
has taken up his Opinion early, he is reſolv'd
to defend it obſtinately.</p>
            <p>Page 20.] The <hi>Inoculators</hi> are charg'd with
<hi>Acting like Empirics,</hi> becauſe <hi>they are not
aſcertain'd of the different Doſes for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Adults.</hi> There does not ſeem to
be any great Matter in this Nicety, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
as it ſtands hitherto; a ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
will communicate the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and
a greater has been found not to do hurt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one Inſtance. If the <hi>Inoculation</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by Inciſion, the different Apertures
will anſwer that Intention: However, there
is a great Difference between recommending
Caution, and forbidding the Practice: It is
ſtill more ſtrange to forbid the Practice, 'till
that is determin'd, which can only be found
out by Practice. According to this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it had been impoſſible ever to have
found out any Thing in Medicine; for he
that gave the firſt Doſe of a Vomiting, or
Purging Medicine, or of any other, could
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0090401000:15"/>
never be ſure of the proper Doſe; nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to this Doctrine, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to give any Body their firſt Doſe of any
Medicine: For who can tell what is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Doſe for any particular Perſon, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often Singularities in every one's Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
In all theſe Matters, Mankind ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
govern themſelves by common Senſe,
and ſtrong Probabilities; there being no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Certainty in any human Affairs.</p>
            <p>Page 25.] The Doctor returns to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Point, that it is <hi>not the Genuine</hi> Small
Pox, <hi>and conſequently no Security againſt that
Diſeaſe.</hi> The Matters of Fact I will anſwer
by themſelves; all I ſhall ſay at preſent is,
that if the Symptoms of the Ingrafted <hi>Small
Pox</hi> are more mild, than thoſe of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sort, I hope the Doctor will not bring
that as an Objection againſt the Practice. I
believe the Patient, in this Caſe, has juſt as
great Certainty for not having the <hi>Small Pox</hi>
again, as any other Perſon who has had them;
<hi>which is no abſolute one.</hi> Thoſe who are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by any Method, I believe, are much
in the ſame Condition, as to their Security
from the Diſeaſe for the future; for which,
I will give the Doctor this one plain Proof,
which is ſufficient to eſtabliſh a moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
This Practice of <hi>Inoculation</hi> has been
continu'd for many Years in ſeveral Countries;
if the <hi>Inoculated</hi> had been ſubject to catch
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> a ſecond Time, ſomething
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0090401000:16"/>
of this Kind muſt have happen'd; and a very
few Inſtances of this, muſt have put an End
to the whole Practice: For can any one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that People in their Senſes would have
continu'd a troubleſome Experiment, which
was not effectual for the Purpoſe for which
it was deſign'd? I will take the Freedom to
ſay, that this ſingle Reflection is a ſtronger
Proof of this Point, than all the Doctor's
Doubts and Suggeſtions, who knows nothing
to the contrary; as I ſhall ſhew by and
by. May it not at leaſt be adviſeable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a Truce in the Diſpute, 'till an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
Caſe of that Kind happens?</p>
            <p>Page 28.] But, Innoculation <hi>does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
take Place and produce the Diſeaſe:</hi>
is Therefore the Practice to be left off? There
are ſome Perſons, who by a Speciality of
their Conſtitutions, ſeem hardly ſuſceptible
of the Diſtemper; and others, who have had
the Diſeaſe, but it has been miſtaken, or
forgot. They go farther in <hi>Turky,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the very running Sores are a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
againſt the <hi>Small Pox.</hi> There may be,
indeed, a ſtrong Preſumption, that Perſons,
who have had ſo ſevere a Tryal as <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
may not be ſuſceptible of the Diſtemper.
Beſides, there are ſeveral Incidents in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Operation, which may not be carefully
attended to; if the Patient has not the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> there is little Hurt done. There
are ſome, whom a very ſtrong Doſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0090401000:17"/>
will not purge: What then? muſt we
never afterwards give a Purge?</p>
            <p>If the Doctor's Aphoriſm, laid down, <hi>Page</hi>
36, That an <hi>Experiment, to make it uſeful,
always muſt be nearly uniform</hi>; there muſt
be no ſuch Thing as the Practice of Phyſick;
unleſs by the Word <hi>nearly</hi> he allows a very
great Latitude.</p>
            <p>I cannot allow it as a ſolid Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Inoculation,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
have not begun it; no more, than that
the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> has never been <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated.</hi>
Were the Doctor's Letter publiſh'd
in <hi>Italian</hi> too, as it is in very elegant <hi>French,</hi>
both Nations, to be ſure, will be ſufficiently
frighten'd from ever attempting this Practice:
And to make the Antidote ſtill more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
let us have it in <hi>Sclavonic</hi> and <hi>High-Dutch,</hi>
               <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>What the Doctor ſays, <hi>Page</hi> 44, of <hi>the
Attention that is to be given to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Weakneſſes of the Conſtitutions of the
Perſons</hi> Inoculated, is a very proper Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and perhaps Miſcarriages, if any ſuch
there be, may be owing to the Neglect of
it. But, as I hinted before, if the leaſt ill
Succeſs, even in the moſt innocent Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of the Practice of Phyſick, ariſing from
Want of Care, or Skill, ſhould be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>Bar</hi> to the Repitition of them, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
muſt leave off to Purge, Vomit, Bleed,
or even to cut Corns, of which Operation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0090401000:18"/>
ſeveral die in a Year within the Bills of
Mortality.</p>
            <p>Page 45.] But it is <hi>poſſible, and even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
the Matter of the</hi> Small Pox <hi>may
communicate the Diſeaſes of the People
from which it is taken.</hi> This is hard! The
Doctor will ſcarcely allow, that the Matter of
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> will communicate the <hi>Small
Pox</hi>; but it is <hi>probable,</hi> that it will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
any other <hi>Diſeaſe. Que vive</hi> Thomas
Diaphoinus, <hi>il n'a Jamais ete vaincu en diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute!</hi>
How are we ſure, that the Aliment,
or Drugs, both for External and Internal U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
don't communicate the Diſeaſes; nay,
the very natural Qualities of thoſe Animals
from which they are taken? I think, indeed,
the Election of wholſome Subjects to <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
from,</hi> is a proper Caution; but the
Doctor demands abſolute Certainty, which
cannot be found in any human Affair, and
leſs ſtill in any Medical or Chyrurgical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
Mankind in all thoſe Matters govern
themſelves by the ſtrongeſt Probabilities; and
that theſe are on the Side of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> I
ſhall plainly demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>Page 51.] The Doctor's Argument from
the <hi>jarring Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Innoculators</hi>; if
all he ſays were true, is juſt as ſtrong againſt
the Practice of Phyſick in General: For if
no Body was to take any Medicine 'till <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
ceaſe to differ,</hi> I believe the Faculty
would ſtarve: May we not with more Truth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0090401000:19"/>
affirm, that the <hi>Anti-inoculators</hi> (a Word
more ſonorous, and longer by two Syllables
than that of <hi>Inoculators</hi>) are as inconſiſtent
and changeable in their Opinions? One
while they aſſerted, that it was impoſſible to
give the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by this Method; when
Experience had convinc'd them, ſome of 'em
at leaſt, of the Untenableneſs of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
then they allow'd, if it prov'd mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
that it was the <hi>Small Pox</hi>; if they eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
to be ſure they would have them again;
If it was a favourable Sort, then there was
ſome inveterate Diſtemper tranſplanted with
it; If any Boils or Impoſthumations appear'd
at the going off of the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> thoſe were
the Effect of the <hi>Inoculation,</hi> not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in General, or
of the Conſtitution of the Patient. Theſe
are certainly, not the Reaſonings of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
and inquiſitive Philoſophers, but the
Cavils of intereſted Diſputants; and it would
be ridiculous, for any Man to be determin'd
by the jarring Opinions, either of the one
Side or t'other.</p>
            <p>There is nothing material in the Way of
Argumentation, 'till we come to <hi>Page</hi> 62.
There this <hi>Practice</hi> is condemn'd, as it tends
to propagate and continue an Infection in
any Place: Here again it is the <hi>Small Pox</hi>;
elſe why ſhould it ſpread the <hi>Small Pox?</hi>
I anſwer, if it be true, that the Generality
of Mankind have the <hi>Small Pox</hi>; if they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0090401000:20"/>
are rare in ſome Years, they muſt be riſe in
others; becauſe a new Stock of Subjects
ſuſceptible of the Diſtemper is produc'd; and
the Operation of this Diſtemper upon the
Maſs of Mankind in any particular Place, is
nearly uniform. When this general Run of
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> happens; I take it to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to the Maſs of the Inhabitants of any
Place in general, except in this one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that when the Diſeaſe is produc'd by a
bad Conſtitution of Air, as it is moſt Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,
ſo it is then moſt mortal. Now if
this Diſtemper ſhould happen to be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an artificial Method in a favourable
Seaſon, would not this be rather an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to Mankind than otherwiſe? For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
The Doctor alledgeth that hardly one
of a hundred hath dy'd of the natural Sort
this Year; would it not then have been
highly profitable to Mankind, that a general
Run of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> had happen'd in ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
a Seaſon; and this would ſtill ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
more ſtrongly for the Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
if not only the Seaſon, but the Method
of Propagation had ten to one of odds of
producing a mild Sort. So that this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Doctor's has the Misfortune,
with a great many of the reſt, to prove the
Contradictory of his Concluſion: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking the Advantage of the Doctor's
hardy Aſſertion, that hardly one of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
have dy'd this Year of the <hi>Small Pox:</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0090401000:21"/>
I will examine it a little by Numbers. I
have not all the Bills of Mortality by me,

Years about 1/12 of the whole Mortality in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
For 21,788 is near 1/12 of 274,615.
During this Term of Years, <hi>London</hi> wanted
an Addition of near 22000 People yearly to
keep it equally full. If all Mankind had the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> then 22000 People, one Year
with another had it; of which 1/12 dy'd; If
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0090401000:22"/>
one half of Mankind had the <hi>Small Pox,</hi>
then 1 out of 6, who had the <hi>Diſtemper,</hi>
dy'd of it. Which, by the way, ſhows the
Doctor to be out in his Calculation; for if
only 1000 die this Year, as perhaps may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the Bills, 100,000 muſt have been
ſick of the <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> to make his Aſſertion
true, <hi>that one only of a hundred dy'd:</hi> If he
means it only of Children, it is a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for <hi>Inoculation,</hi> becauſe it allows that
to be a favourable Age.</p>
            <p>By the Bills of Mortality of <hi>Breſlaw</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the Maſs of Mankind loſe above
25 <hi>per Cent,</hi> before they are a Year old; that
is, of a 100 that are born, more than 25 die
that firſt Year: I may ſay with great Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that not 1/9 of thoſe have the <hi>Small Pox</hi>
at all; but die of other <hi>Diſeaſes</hi>; and that
in the Account, as it ſtands before us 8 of 9
of Infants may be reckon'd neither Subjects
of the <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> nor of this Practice, but
as it were <hi>non-Entities.</hi> Therefore out of
the 22000 People, the yearly Recruits of
<hi>London</hi> abovemention'd, ſubſtracting 4000,
there remains 18000, of which yearly there
died above 1800 of the <hi>Small Pox</hi>; that is,

enough to ſay, that Phyſicians (like the

But to proceed, If, as I ſaid, all Mankind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

a Year old have the <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> I out
of 10 dies of it; If one half, then 1 out of 5,
which have the <hi>Diſtemper</hi> the natural way,
dies of it: If ¼ of Mankind have the <hi>Small
Pox</hi> once in their Life, then of them 2 out
of 15 die: If 5/6, then 3 out of 25, which have
the <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> die of it. According to D. <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton</hi>'s
Calculation; out of 1245 who had
the natural <hi>Small Pox</hi> in ſome Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is about 22 out of a hundred. As to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential

to leſſen the Dread and Danger of this
terrible Peſtilence.</p>
            <p>By the Accounts of the <hi>Inoculation in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and the <hi>Plantations,</hi> tho' it is an early
Practice, and has not been manag'd with due
Care and Circumſpection; out of about 500
on whom it has been perform'd, the Enemies
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0090401000:24"/>
of the Practice have not produc'd the Names
of above 3 Perſons that have died; allowing
their Deaths chargeable on this Practice,
which I believe is not in Fact true: A Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
which brings the Mortality of the <hi>Small
Pox</hi> from one in ten to one in a hundred, if
it obtain'd univerſally would ſave to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London</hi> at leaſt 1500 People yearly;
and the ſame Odds wou'd be a ſufficient pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Motive to any private Perſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon, abſtracting from the more occult
and abſtruſe Cauſes which ſeem to favour
this Operation. It is a ſelf evident Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that a Perſon who receives the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> has a much fairer
Chance for his Life, than he who takes it
the natural Way; unleſs it can be affirmed,
that the having the Election of all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comſtances
of the Diſeaſe, is of no manner
of Advantage. For Example, it muſt be of
ſome Benefit, to know that one is to have
the Diſtemper nine or ten Dayes before it
comes; rather than to be ſurpris'd, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
miſtaken in it. To have it at an Age
when it is not ſo mortal: To take it when
the Body is in a temperate and cool State, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in a contrary one: When the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Air is favourable, rather than
malignant: After a cool Dyet and other due
Preparations, rather than after a Surfeit or a
drunken Bout. For if the principal Strokes
towards the Cure, are in the Regimen, in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0090401000:25"/>
Beginning of a Diſtemper; it muſt be ſtill
more ſo, in a Regimen before it begins. If
the Doctor will deny theſe Truths, I have
done. But if the having all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
abovemention'd in one's Power be of
ſome Advantage, then the <hi>Practice of Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi>
cannot be hurtfull but beneficial to
Mankind in general: Then why muſt an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
already practis'd with Succeſs in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Country, that bids fair to ſave the
Lives of Multitudes, be entirely laid aſide
and cruſh'd in the Bud? Cannot the learned
Phyſicians, who ſo zealouſly oppoſe it, have
a little Patience, and Time will clear up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Things in it, which perhaps may be now
doubtful? Therefore ſince this Practice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be hurtful but beneficial to Mankind in
general, it ought not to be diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>As to the Inconſiſtencies and Miſtakes, the
Doctor is pleas'd to charge me withall: I ſhall
always be ſo ingenuous as to own ſuch, as
my Inadvertency or Want of Experience
have ſubjected me to. What I wrote was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the beſt Information or Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
I had at that Time. General Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
in practical Matters, are not to be
underſtood in the Strictneſs of a Logical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality.
The Symptoms from which I
exempted the Inoculated <hi>Small Pox,</hi> are to
be underſtood in a Comparative Senſe, with
regard to thoſe of the natural Sort; the
Word <hi>uſual</hi> will juſtify this Meaning, in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0090401000:26"/>
which any Reader, not quite Captious, will
interpret them. If with all theſe Reſtrictions
I cannot be favourably underſtood, I beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
and as I ſaid before, I ſhall be always
willing to recant any Miſtake. But as on the
one hand, I ſtudy to keep myſelf free from
Prejudices, ſo as to be ſuſceptible of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Conviction, which may ariſe from <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>;
ſo I wou'd not ſubmit a Point al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
eſtabliſh'd, to the ſilly Cavils of thoſe
who have none.</p>
            <p>I am ſure, I am not miſtaken in the
Account of the <hi>Inoculation</hi> at <hi>Newgate</hi>;
but the Doctor is. I referr the Reader
to my printed <hi>Journal</hi>; whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the Operation was fairly and
equally perform'd on all: And I can with
great Truth, declare, that I had no Intention
to make any Difference in the Inciſions; nor
was there, indeed, any made. The Doctor
not having ſeen <hi>Evans,</hi> the Man who had
had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> before, till next Day, when
they were partly heal'd, this might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
his Miſtake. Nor was the Matter taken
from a violent Flux-kind, but from a full
diſtinct Coherent kind, and at the proper
Time. Mrs. <hi>Tompions</hi> Boil (as he call's it)
on her Arm; was not the ſame from the firſt
Day of the Eruption; nor the only one ſhe
had: But was a fair, regular Puſtule of the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> of which alſo ſhe had others, if
he had been pleas'd to examine. <hi>Alcock,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0090401000:27"/>
who had the <hi>Goal-Diſtemper,</hi> had alſo 60
Puſtules, at leaſt, of the <hi>Genuine Small Pox</hi>;
with a gentle Fever before the Eruption.
As to all of them, having had but few Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
I hope, that is no Objection againſt
the Practice. And as to the Time and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their Puſtules going off; they were
much the ſame, as in the gentler Sort of
<hi>Small Pox:</hi> Only that <hi>Alcock</hi> opening his
with a Pin, made them fall off ſooner. The
Doctor might have taken Notice, that <hi>Eliz.
Harriſon,</hi> who had them as gently, at leaſt,
as any of them; has been employ'd ſince in
Nurſing above 20 People in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi>
and never has catch'd them: Which any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Perſon will judge to be a better Proof
of the Genuinneſs of the Diſtemper, than all
his Obſervations can evince to the contrary.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi>'s Caſe, it is true. But
the Inference is only, that there was one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
on whom the <hi>Inoculation</hi> did not take
place. I hope the Doctor has not forgot that
he own'd to me that Mr. <hi>Colt</hi>'s Children had
the true <hi>Small Pox</hi>; tho' their Caſe differ'd
in nothing from thoſe in <hi>Newgate</hi>; but in
the Degrees of the Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>As to the Experiment in St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,</hi>
after two vaſtly large Inciſions, and
an immoderate Quantity of the Matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd;
three Days and Nights Confinement
of the Patient to his Bed, without opening
his Bandage, a warm Regimen, in a hot Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0090401000:28"/>
I viſited him, (to know the Truth of
the Noiſe that was made) on the ſixth Day
after the Operation, and ſaw no Eruptions,
nor had he any; nor were his Inciſions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted:
I took the Freedom to ask Doctor
<hi>Wadſworth</hi> then preſent, whether the Sores
(pointing at them) were like thoſe he ſaw
at <hi>Newgate?</hi> And he fairly own'd, he cou'd
not ſay they were. I again ſaw this Patient
a Week after, but ſtill no Eruption; If any
Eruptions happen'd between theſe Times,
they could not be the <hi>Small Pox:</hi> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
none who ſaw and attended both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
can truly ſay, they were like thoſe
in <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I own that it ſeem'd probable that the ſix
Perſons in Mr. <hi>Batt</hi>'s Family might have
catch'd the <hi>Small Pox</hi> of the Girl that was
<hi>Inoculated</hi>; but it is well known that the
<hi>Small Pox</hi> were rife not only at <hi>Hertford,</hi>
but in ſeveral Villages round it, many
Months before any Perſon was <hi>Inoculated</hi>
there: Witneſs Mr. <hi>Dobb</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Chriſt's
Hoſpital</hi> Buildings, where he himſelf died
of the worſt Sort with Purples; and his
Children had it. Some other Families there,
and particularly Mrs. <hi>Moſs</hi>'s, where the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-named
<hi>Elizabeth Harriſon, Inoculated</hi>
in <hi>Newgate,</hi> attended ſeveral Perſons under
it, to prove whether ſhe would catch the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
by Infection; Both <hi>Latin Boarding-Schools</hi>;
Mr. <hi>Stout</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Loyd</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0090401000:29"/>
Mr. <hi>John Dimſdale</hi>'s Coachman and
his Wiſe; and Mr. <hi>Santoon</hi>'s Maid-Servant,
who was brought to the ſame Houſe, and
died of the Confluent kind of the <hi>Small Pox</hi>;
I took Matter from the ſaid Coachman to
<hi>Inoculate</hi> Mr. <hi>Batt</hi>'s Daughter in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Farm Houſe, the <hi>firſt</hi> Ingrafted in that
Country. After this I took Matter alſo from
Mr. <hi>Stout</hi>'s Maid-Servant to <hi>Inoculate</hi> Mrs
<hi>Heath</hi>'s two Sons; which were all I <hi>Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi>
in that Town. Beſides all theſe there
were a great many more, whoſe Names I
cannot at preſent call to mind both in Town
and Country about it, who had the <hi>Small
Pox,</hi> and ſeveral died of it, the Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I began this Practice: Theſe are Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, which the Doctor's Author can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               </gap> that Town, upon two ſingle Boys who
were <hi>Inoculated</hi> in a Court in a manner ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from all the reſt of the Town, which
was fuller of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> before than after
the <hi>Inoculation,</hi> is not agreeable to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
which the Doctor ſeems to demand
of his Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of Mr. <hi>De Grave</hi>'s Daughter
which fills up three or four Pages in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and upon which the Doctor lays the
Foundation of his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the Reader may
pleaſe to take from her Father's own Words
in his Letter annex'd. From which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0090401000:30"/>
that the Girl had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> but
once, of the favourable kind; and in all
Probability by <hi>Inoculation.</hi> So far the Caſe
is ſingular, that it did not take place till ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Weeks after the Operation; and untill
the Blood was put into a Ferment by violent
Motion. Here the Doctor triumphs in his
<hi>Dilemma, Either ſhe had, or ſhe had not the</hi>
Small Pox <hi>by Inoculation</hi>; If the firſt, then it
is plain <hi>Inoculation</hi> is no <hi>preventive</hi> of the
<hi>Diſeaſe</hi>; If the ſecond, the <hi>Experiment</hi> is
good for nothing. I think in this way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation,
to make it concluſive, there
ought to be a perfect <hi>Enumeration</hi>; but here
is a <hi>Third</hi> Caſe, and the real one, not enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated;
which is, that the Girl had the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> and that but once, by <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;
tho' not at the ſame Time when the
Doctor lays the Scene of his <hi>Dilemma.</hi> But
to conſider the Second Branch; allowing
that this <hi>Small Pox</hi> was the natural Sort,
and not produc'd by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> of which,
I think, the contrary is plain; ſure it is a
ſtrange Inſerence to ſay, that becauſe <hi>Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
has not taken Effect in one Subject, it
is therefore good for nothing. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
excellent Judgment will inſtruct him
to reaſon with more Temper and Solidity in
other Matters of his Profeſſion; and not
make Uſe of his <hi>Aphoriſm, That one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
is as good as a thouſand in Matters of
Experience. What the Doctor ſays of his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0090401000:31"/>
Fears of a great Claſs of Hypothetical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
is all vaniſh'd, and the Girl is very
well. I refer the Doctor upon this Head
of the Preventive Power of <hi>Inoculation,</hi>
to the Letter which he lays ſo much Streſs
upon, from <hi>Boſton</hi>; where his Ally in
this Diſpute owns, <hi>That not one of the</hi> Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
(being about three Hundred) <hi>during
the Space of five or ſix Months,</hi> in a general
Run of the <hi>Small Pox, has had the</hi> Small
Pox <hi>the natural Way, as far as we know:</hi>
But of this more afterwards.</p>
            <p>As for his ſecond Story of Captain <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,</hi>
it requires only a bare Reading to make
it ridiculous; For no unprejudic'd Perſon of
common Senſe can believe that one, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been <hi>Inoculated</hi> twice without any Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
would try it a third Time: But after a
third Time, to try it a fourth, fifth, and ſixth
Time, paſſeth all Degrees of Credibility. But
it ſeems this Captain was not very certain,
whether it was five or ſix Times; one <hi>Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
had quite ſlipt out of his Memory: he
wanted one Quality, which the Proverb de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

whether a Bill, or an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

my Reader with any Reflection; but
refer him to the Matter of Fact here ſubjoin'd,
as it is teſtify'd by the Surgeon and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
that attended him.</p>

                  </gap>ts</hi>'s Servant,
I refer to the Account ſubjoin'd.</p>
            <p>He is juſt as much miſinform'd of the Caſe
of Lord <hi>F<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>'s Son, who had a favourable
Sort of <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and was in no Danger
of his Life; as the Phyſician who attended
him will readily own.</p>
            <p>As to the unfortunate Accidents which
have happen'd to ſome of the Firſt Rank by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0090401000:34"/>
this <hi>Ingrafting Method</hi>; if I gueſs right who
he means, one of them is perfectly well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any unfortunate Accident; and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumation,
which had no Dependance nor
Communication with the Inciſion, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cur'd without any Exfoliation of the
Bone, or any <hi>Hectic Fever.</hi> But it is hard to
charge the common Accidents of the <hi>Small
Pox</hi> in general, upon this Method in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>It is no leſs a Miſinformation, that the
Children of a Nobleman, underſtood in his
Letter, were <hi>Ingrafted</hi> from a bad Sort of
<hi>Small Pox.</hi> As to what he ſays of the poorer
Sort of <hi>People of</hi> Scotland, <hi>running about
with the</hi> Small Pox <hi>upon them, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Shoes or Stockings</hi>; the Doctor ſeems
here to intend a Reflection, but I chooſe to
avoid all Reflections, either National or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick.
I believe the People of <hi>England,</hi> as
well as thoſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the moſt Part,
neither wear <hi>Shoes</hi> nor <hi>Stockings</hi> in the <hi>Small
Pox:</hi> As to their Cuſtom or Ability of <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about,</hi> they are much in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as they are here; ſome have them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably,
ſome otherwiſe, and every one has
Conveniencies and Helps according to their
Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>As for the three Letters from <hi>Boſton</hi> in
<hi>New England,</hi> printed by Way of <hi>Appendix</hi>
to the Doctor's, It might ſuffice to ſay, that
they are only a ſevere, and perhaps a juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0090401000:35"/>
againſt the Clergy and others, for
meddling in this Branch of the Phyſicians
Practice: Upon which Encroachment, ſome
of the Faculty invoke the Vengeance of the
Civil Magiſtrate; and threaten the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as <hi>Poiſoners</hi> and <hi>Spreaders of Infection,</hi>
with Priſons and Gibbet's: And if the Laws
in being are ſomewhat deficient, modeſtly
call, as ſome others have done, upon the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature
for new Ones. This general Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
is ſufficient to invalidate the Credit
of any Thing that is ſaid by a Perſon ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſted: But ſo great is the Force of
Truth, that it has extorted enough from this
partial Complainant to juſtify the Practice,
which he ſo bitterly inveighs againſt. For
firſt he owns, that the whole Practice of <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi>
was manag'd by unskillful Perſons;
and that many <hi>who dy'd or ſuffer'd much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
Inoculation, <hi>if they had had better Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
might have had better Fate.</hi> That
the Practitioners neglected <hi>as trivial both the
Advantages of a ſuitable Seaſon, and a well prepared
Body; That they</hi> Inoculated <hi>all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Conſtitutions from the Beginning;
That they</hi> Inoculated <hi>Women with Child, and
Hyſterical people:</hi> And after all, <hi>They pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
it at firſt with indifferent good Succeſs:
That it had been practis'd, ſince the Middle
of</hi> June <hi>to the Date of his Letter,</hi> Dec. 20.
<hi>upon above two hundred Subjects with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Succceſs.</hi> He tells you in his ſecond Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0090401000:36"/>
               <hi>That they had at that Time the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of two or three Hundred</hi> Inoculated:
And after all this, in all his three Letters, he
gives you only two Letters of the Name of
one <hi>Inoculated</hi> Perſon who dy'd, Mrs. <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>l.</hi>
He ſays at Random, <hi>that others dy'd of it,
whom Time may bring to Light.</hi> Were the
Bodies of thoſe <hi>Inoculated</hi> Perſons hid under
Dunghills? Had they not Chriſtian Burial?
It is wondrous ſtrange, that in a Place, where
the Practitioners in Phyſick and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
both were againſt <hi>Inoculation,</hi> he could
not come at the Knowledge of a Mortal
Caſe but one, the <hi>Inoculated</hi> Mrs. <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>l,</hi>
who is trump'd up upon all Occaſions: He
ſays, <hi>many of the</hi> Inoculated <hi>ſuffer much,</hi>
Page 2. What then? A Perſon that has the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> even in the gentleſt Sort, muſt
ſuffer, And at laſt, Page 10, he ingenuouſly
acknowledges, <hi>That the</hi> Small Pox (acquir'd
by <hi>Inoculation</hi>) <hi>is frequently more favourable
than in the common Way, and not altogether
ſo mortal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That not one of the</hi> Inoculated
<hi>during the Space of five or ſix Months has
had the</hi> Small Pox <hi>in the natural Way, ſo
far as we know</hi>; that is, of about three
hundred People <hi>Inoculated,</hi> ſome of which,
no doubt, had only thoſe Eruptions, which
they will not allow to be the genuine <hi>Small
Pox</hi>; In a Time, when the <hi>whole Town
and Country was an Hoſpital of People ſick</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0090401000:37"/>
               <hi>of the Diſtemper, and few Perſons exempt
from its Rage, for the Space of five or ſix
Months,</hi> not ſo much as one had the <hi>Small
Pox,</hi> for <hi>ought they knew:</hi> I ſay, if ſuch a
Caſe had happen'd, it is not probable it could
have been conceal'd; and that this Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
from one, who is ſo zealous an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to the Practice, is a ſtronger Proof of
the Efficacy of it, for the Purpoſe intended,
than all the <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>May-be's</hi> of this or any
other Letter-Writer.</p>
            <p>It had been fair in this Gentleman to have
given in the Numbers that dy'd of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sort of <hi>Small Pox,</hi> during that Seaſon;
or to have ſtated the Caſe fairly between two
or three Hundred ſick of the natural Sort, and
as many of the <hi>Inoculated</hi> Kind, both under
the Care and Direction of unskillful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd
People: And then, perhaps, as in
the <hi>Inoculated</hi> Kind, he could inſtance, by
Name, only One that dy'd; In the other Sort
he would have been puzzled to find the
Names of thoſe who eſcap'd.</p>
            <p>But to this he will ſay, that the <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Small Pox</hi> propagated the Mortality of
the natural Sort. There is a full Anſwer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to this Objection of ſpreading Infection
before. I think it is hard to exclude Men
from the Means of ſecuring themſelves from
a great Peſtilence, upon a meer Suggeſtion:
The Influence of the natural <hi>Small Pox</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Mankind, in any Place, in a Circle of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0090401000:38"/>
Years, may be affirm'd to be uniform with
ſtrong Probability; and if the Air of any
Place, in a contagious <hi>Seaſon,</hi> is ſuch, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Diſtemper very mortal, it is a ſtrong
Motive for People to take the Advantage of
a good Seaſon, and ſecure themſelves in
Time from a Plague, which is ſo likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them: And if Prudence only were to
be conſulted, it would perhaps be much more
the Duty of the Legiſlature to order, than to
forbid this Practice. And no doubt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Acknowledgment of the Enemies
of this Practice, they would, by this Method,
diminiſh the Mortality, and encreaſe the
Number of their People; and the Magiſtrate
is forc'd often upon more arbitrary Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in any Peſtilence: But as that would
ſeem too great an Encroachment upon the
natural Rights of Mankind, I ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of it. But on the other Hand, it would
be a moſt Tyrannical Encroachment upon
the ſame Rights, to debar Mankind from the
lawful Means of ſecuring themſelves from
the Fear and Danger of ſo terrible a Plague.</p>
            <p>As for the particular <hi>Faetor,</hi> that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Letter, <hi>attends the Sores of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated</hi>;
it is much of a Piece with the
Story of the <hi>Kentiſh Long - Tayls:</hi> It ſhews
him to be an utter Stranger to the whole
Practice; and makes one doubt, whether he
ever ſaw a Caſe of <hi>Inoculation</hi> quite through.
And the <hi>Pointing at the</hi> Inoculated <hi>in the</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0090401000:39"/>
               <hi>Streets,</hi> is as great an Inſtance of Barbarity,
as the other is of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>There is a Letter in Town from the Revd.
Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> at <hi>Boſton</hi> of a later Date, which
has ſeveral remarkable Paſſages in it. <hi>The
Diſtemper</hi> (meaning the Small Pox) <hi>has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
viſited and ranſacked the City of</hi> Boſton;
<hi>and in little more than half a Year, of about
five thouſand Perſons, that have undergone
it, near nine hundred have died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how many Lives might have been
ſav'd, if our unhappy Phyſicians had not poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
and bewitch'd our People with a blind
Rage, that has appear'd, very like a Satanick
Poſſeſſion, againſt the Method of Relief and
Safety in the way of the</hi> Small Pox <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
I prevail'd with one Phyſician (and for
it, I have had bloody Attempts made upon
my Life by ſome of our Energumens) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
the Practice; and the Experiment
has been made upon almoſt three hundred Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in our Neighbourhood, young and old,
from one Year to ſeventy; weak and ſtrong,
Male and Female, white and black; in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer,
in Autumn and Winter: And it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to Admiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot learn that any one has died of it,
tho' the Experiment has been made under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and marvellous Diſadvantages. Five
or ſix have died upon it or after it; but from
other Accidents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0090401000:40"/>
He mentions afterward <hi>that Cats had it</hi>;
<hi>and takes notice of the ſame thing in Doctor</hi>
Leigh's <hi>Hiſtory of</hi> Lancaſhire; <hi>and ſubjoins,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>it was generally complain'd that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon-houſes
of the City continu'd unfruitful;
and the Pigeons did not lay or hatch, as they
us'd to do, all the while that the</hi> Small Pox
<hi>was in its Epidemical Progreſs: And it is
very ſtrongly affirmed, that our Dunghill
Fowl felt much of the like upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt concludes; <hi>with the great Benefit
they have found by Bliſters early apply'd and
continu'd in the natural</hi> Small Pox, <hi>and is
ſorry it was ſo late before they fell into this
Way; but it has conſtantly proſper'd: I
know not, ſays he, that it has once miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſince we came into it.</hi> I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his Letter annex'd.</p>
            <p>It appears by this Letter, that ſomewhat
more than one out of five, and leſs than one
out of ſix died of the Diſtemper. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
by the Effects mention'd upon Animals,
that the general Contagion was owing to a
bad Diſpoſition of the Air; and not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
upon <hi>Inoculation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, notwithſtanding the unfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Conſtitution of the Air, the <hi>Inoculated</hi>
did well.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but the impartial Reader is
now ſatisfy'd that this Practice of <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
may be ſtill beneficial to Mankind, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
any thing that the Doctor has
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0090401000:41"/>
adduc'd to the contrary, either by way of
Argument or Fact. And that by the ſame
zealous Partiality, it had been eaſy to have
cruſh'd any, the moſt uſeful Practice in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
in the Beginning. It is pretty remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable,
that in a Neighbouring Nation, where
Agues are the beſt Branch of the Phyſicians
Practice, the Uſe of the Bark has been, and
is ſtill in a great Meaſure, ſuppreſs'd by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
not much unlike what are us'd againſt
<hi>Inoculation</hi>; and indeed every one of the
Doctor's Arguments would have concluded
more ſtrongly againſt the Uſe of the <hi>Cortex,</hi>
than againſt this Practice. I will ſuppoſe any
Stickler againſt the Bark to have reaſon'd
thus in the Doctor's Strain. <hi>A Drug that
has been only us'd among Slaves, an illiterate
unthinking People, who have the Advantage
of a warm Climate, and a Spare Dyet, is not
fit to be immediately diſpens'd to the</hi> Engliſh,
<hi>whoſe Blood, ſpeaking of it as National, is
the Product of the Richeſt Dyet: Is it not
plain by the Diſeaſes that it often leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it, that it ſpoils the Conſtitution? Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the Jaundice, Tumours of the Legs, and
other Cachexies that are often ſubſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. Beſides none but Empirics can give
a Medicine of which they are not ſure of the
Doſe; Is it not plain that it will not anſwer
the Deſign of preventing the Diſeaſe for the
future? For notwithſtanding the Uſe of this
Drug, the Patient ſuffers many a Relapſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0090401000:42"/>
               <hi>there are not only one or two, but innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Inſtances of People who have died
after the Uſe of it; and others, who have
had a diſeaſed Conſtitution all the reſt of their
Lives. The Diſpenſers of this Medicine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree
widely among themſelves, both as to
the Manner of its Operation and the Doſe;
Some give it in Tincture; ſome in Subſtance;
ſome in greater, ſome in leſſer Quantities, &amp;c.
In fine, there are three Letters from a Friend
in</hi> New England, <hi>which inform me that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who have taken the Bark have ſuffer'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much; and Mrs.</hi> D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>l, <hi>who had taken
great Quantities of it, actually died, &amp;c. Tho'
I have not my ſelf made Uſe of this Medicine,
nor ſeen much of the Effects of it; I am well
aſſur'd, that not a fourth part of the Diſeaſes
it pretends to cure, are Genuine Agues: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had ſeen the Practice of this Medicine,
I affirmed, that is was impoſſible, it would cure
an Ague; but I am willing to retract that
Opinion, being convinc'd by an Experiment,
that it does ſo ſometimes.</hi> It were eaſy to
carry this Parallel reaſoning thro' the whole
Letter, not only with equal, but more
Strength in moſt Places.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, in appearing with ſo great
Zeal againſt this Practice, is not the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
of the whole Faculty. For there
are many of them who from their Diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtedneſs
and Innate Love to Mankind, are
willing, that an Experiment ſhould go on,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0090401000:43"/>
which, in Proportion to the Extenſiveneſs of
the Practice, muſt neceſſarily diminiſh the
Mortality of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in general: This
is a candid, as well as decent Way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
At the ſame Time, I only blame the
Author of the Letter, and thoſe who take
part with him, for their too early and ſtrong
Prejudices; being unwilling to Cenſure
their Intentions, which I hope, are for the
Good of Mankind, as well as my own.</p>
            <p>But there is ſtill a ſtronger <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Maſſey's Sermon,</hi> Page 6.</note> Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this Practice; <hi>That it is unlawful, and
firſt introduc'd by the Devil, who Ingrafted</hi>
Job <hi>of the Confluent Sort of</hi> Small Pox.</p>
            <p>From uſeful Diſcoveries, there can always
be drawn important Conſequences. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
Hence learn we, that the <hi>Small Pox</hi> is an
ancient Diſeaſe; for if it was convey'd to
Job <hi>by ſome ſuch Way as</hi> Inoculation, the
Matter muſt have been taken from ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Infected with the Diſtemper. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That <hi>Sydenham</hi> was not the firſt that began
the <hi>cool Regimen</hi>; for <hi>Job</hi> fat down upon
the Aſhes in the open Air; <hi>his Friends ſaw
him afar off. Thirdly,</hi> That his Friends were
tardy, above three Weeks before they came
to ſee him; for in the Genuine Confluent
Kind of <hi>Small Pox,</hi> it will be that Time
before they can bear ſcraping with a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0090401000:44"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Beloved, this confluent Sort
of <hi>Small Pox</hi> were more gentle, to be ſure,
than the common natural Ones; for he ſeems
neither to have had Delirium, ſore Throat,
nor Shortneſs of Breath; he talk'd diſtinctly
and good Senſe.</p>
            <p>Now here a Queſtion ariſeth, Whether an
honeſt Man can do that which the Devil has
done? I anſwer in the Affirmative; there are
three things mention'd; of the Devil's Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
himſelf (as in this Place) with the Sons
of God; Believing, and Quoting of Scripture.
All theſe Things a good Man may not only
do, but is bound to do.</p>
            <p>I readily agree with this Reverend Divine,
that if <hi>Inoculating</hi> the <hi>Small Pox</hi> be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Action, it cannot be juſtify'd by the
Good which may enſue from it; but that
it is unlawful, muſt be prov'd, either by ſome
natural or poſitive Law: That this Reverend
Gentleman has brought no ſuch Proof, either
from natural or reveal'd Religion, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
plain upon a very ſhort Review of his
Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Page 13.] He ſays he will attempt to prove,
<hi>That Diſeaſes are utterly unlawful to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by any who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians:</hi>
He terms it very right; for it is an Attempt
to Prove, and no more. By reſtraining the
Prohibition to Chriſtians, one would think,
there was ſome poſitive Command in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
againſt it; but he has brought none, which,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0090401000:45"/>
by the moſt forc'd Conſtruction, can prove
<hi>Inoculation</hi> to be prohibited by the Chriſtian
Diſpenſation. I know of no Immorality that
is forbid to a Chriſtian, the Practice of which
is allow'd to an Infidel. Indeed Morality is
more clearly taught and more ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
by Rewards and Puniſhments amongſt
us; but it does not change its Nature amongſt
the reſt of Mankind. He does not wonder,
that the Practice of <hi>Inoculation</hi> ſhould obtain,
where the Doctrine of <hi>Fatality</hi> is believ'd; but
the Misfortune is, that the Matter of Fact is
quite otherwiſe: For if he had carefully pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus'd
Dr. <hi>Wagſtaffe</hi>'s Diſcourſe, which he ſo
much commends, that would have inform'd
him, <hi>That no Body pretends to give us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of an</hi> Inoculated Turk. And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Belief of a Fatality makes them
neglect very much the ordinary Helps of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
for preſerving their Lives.</p>
            <p>Page 14.] The Inſtances which he gives
of Almighty God's having given a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Power to Mankind to inflict Diſeaſes
for their Puniſhment, does not prove, that
He has not given them an ordinary one for
their Benefit.</p>
            <p>And his ſaying, [Pag.15] <hi>That no Man was
ever yet condemn'd to an immediate Sickneſs,
for Want of ſufficient Authority</hi>; is, without
any Proof. Diſeaſes are External, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>;
the Magiſtrate very often inflicts both:
That Criminals are lawfully puniſh'd with the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0090401000:46"/>
Mutilation of their Body, I ſuppoſe he will
allow to be common. Is not that inflicting
a Diſeaſe with a Witneſs? And are there not
many Executions perform'd by Poiſon, which
is inflicting an Internal mortal Diſeaſe? And
here his own Argument turns upon him; for
<hi>if Diſeaſes are ſent for the Puniſhment of
our Sins,</hi> then it would ſeem to follow, that
the Magiſtrate, who has a Power from God to
puniſh our Crimes, has likewiſe a Power to
inflict Diſeaſes, <hi>for Sins that are manifeſt to
him and all the World.</hi> The greater Power
of inflicting Death, certainly includes the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
in the Choice of the Means: If, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
there ſhould be a Law made to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the <hi>Inoculators</hi> with the <hi>Inoculation</hi> of
ſome Diſeaſe, I fancy this Reverend Divine
would not think it ſinful or unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>Page 16.] He ſpends a long Paragraph, to
prove what no Body ever deny'd; That a
Man cannot lawfully do all that is in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to do: And another as evident, That the
Means, as well as the Intention, muſt be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
but theſe are only general Propoſitions;
The Subſumption, that inflicting Diſeaſes for
a good Purpoſe is unlawful, is only ſuppos'd,
not prov'd.</p>
            <p>Page 18.] He <hi>doubts whether the Life of
Man be a Good or not.</hi> If the Life of Man is
no Good, then, indeed, to act for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of it, is not to act for any good
End; and conſequently, not only this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0090401000:47"/>
but all others in Medicine, and many
other charitable Actions, muſt be given up.
The reſt of the Argument of this Paragraph,
is grounded upon the Inſufficiency of this
Method for the Purpoſe intended. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
might have remember'd, from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of his Text, <hi>Job</hi> had the <hi>Small Pox</hi>
by <hi>Inoculation</hi> from the Devil, even of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Sort; that he recover'd of them,
and never had them again. But in this he muſt
forgive me, if I put him in Mind, that he is
out of his Sphere; and that notwithſtanding
his Profeſſions to the contrary, he lays aſide
the Divine, and takes upon him the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
The Queſtion here is, Whether giving
a Diſeaſe with a good Intention, be in it ſelf
an unlawful Action.</p>
            <p>Page 20.] Another Argument is, <hi>That a
Law which forbids the Evil, forbids alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that has a Tendency to it; therefore
all cauſeleſs and voluntary Mutilations are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid:</hi>
And yet, notwithſtanding this Law againſt
Mutilation, more expreſs than any againſt <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noculation,</hi>
Surgeons cut off Peoples Limbs.
Here the Intention hallows the Action, which
is in itſelf expreſly forbid; and which is more,
I believe no Surgeon will affirm, that in all
Caſes, where Limbs are cut off, there is a
direct Impoſſibility to ſave the Patient's Life
otherwiſe; or that the Operation is always
ſucceſsful. A Surgeon who cuts a Perſon for
the <hi>Stone,</hi> even if his Patient dies of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0090401000:48"/>
does not think he has committed
a mortal Sin, in inflicting a mortal Diſeaſe;
and yet the Patient perhaps might have liv'd
many Years, and not dy'd of the Diſtemper at
laſt. The Difference of the two Caſes, the
one being for Cure, the other for Prevention,
does not change the State of the Queſtion;
which, in general Terms, is this, Whether
Mankind have a Lawful Power of inflicting
Diſeaſes for good Purpoſes? A Perſon who
has not had the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> may be very
juſtly conſider'd, as having the Seeds of a
mortal Diſtemper within him; and the Dread
of it is ſurely a Suffering, that will juſtify the
Lawfulneſs of uſing Means, which have the
greateſt Probability of ſaving him from a
Danger, which, for ought he knows, may
be nearer and greater, than that of a Stone
in the Bladder. Anxiety and Bodily Pain,
don't differ ſo much, as to make an Action
lawful in one Caſe, ſinful in the other.</p>
            <p>Page 21.] But it ſeems <hi>it is a Tempting of
Providence.</hi> And there is no great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the <hi>Devil's Propoſal to our
Saviour, to caſt himſelf down headlong, and
that of</hi> Inoculation. It is wonderful, into
what Abſurdities, Zeal for an Opinion, will
drive a Man, even to aſſert that there is no
Difference between a Man's running into a
Danger abſolutely unneceſſary, and from
which nothing but a direct Miracle can ſave
him; and a Venturing on a ſmall Hazard to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0090401000:49"/>
avoid a much greater. The Caſe put it as
diſadvantagiouſly as poſſible, more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that of a Perſon who leaps out of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
for fear of Fire, and ſurely that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be reckon'd a Miſtruſt of Providence,
even if he did it before he was much in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
for no body can ſay that God Almighty
may not ſave a Man from Fire in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Courſe of his Providence; And if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who being prompted by his too early
Fears had taken this Courſe, and loſt his Life
by the Fall; no body will arraign him of
<hi>Self-murder:</hi> He might have done an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but not a ſinful Action. The Parents
who ſuffer their Children to converſe with
their infected Relations; which differs in no
Moral Point from the Caſe of <hi>Inoculation,</hi>
would think it very hard to be treated as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micides
or Murderers of their Children, when
the very Action proceeds from, the contrary
Principle, extreme Tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>Pag. 22.] In the former Page, it was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
Truſt; in this, it is an intire Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
of Providence. He is ſure to have the
<hi>Inoculators</hi> ſome way or other.</p>
            <p>Pag. 23.] They cannot pray for a Bleſſing
upon their Endeavours; becauſe Prayer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the Uſe of lawful Means.</p>
            <p>I believe the contrary is true, for as a
Perſon, who is <hi>Inoculated,</hi> puts himſelf more
immediately into the Hands of God, if he
has any Senſe of Religion, cannot avoid
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0090401000:50"/>
praying for a Bleſſing upon the Means, which,
to be ſure, he thinks lawful, and has not yet
been prov'd to be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Page 24.] His Argument to prove that
<hi>Inoculation</hi> tends to promote Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
is the moſt extraordinary of all.
This it does, by taking off the Dread of
the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and conſequently the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints
of Sobriety that Mankind lie under
upon that Account. This Reverend Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
has very juſtly found fault with one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim,
to <hi>do Evil that Good may come of it:</hi>
But he has eſtabliſh'd one, juſt as dangerous
in the room of it, <hi>not to do Good leaſt Evil
come of it.</hi> For if the Diminiſhing the Fear
of Dying of Diſeaſes catch'd by Irregularity,
is an Evil, then an able Phyſician is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Nuiſance. We have reaſon to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that there are a ſufficient Number left,
who cannot be charg'd with being Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Vice and Immorality, upon this Score.
This Principle in its full Extent would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
all Works of Charity and Mercy; for
the Hope of Forgiveneſs is an Encouragment
to do Injuries; and the Hope of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
in Want is a Diſcouragement to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
            <p>I am touch'd with the devout Reflections
upon Providence, that are all along ſpread
thro' his Sermon, to which I ſubſcribe with
all my Heart; but I cannot ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Diſtorting thoſe great and ſolemn
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0090401000:51"/>
Truths of our Holy Religion to mantain lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Party Intereſts and faſhionable Opinions.
The Text that is quoted Pag. 22. that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hairs of our Head are numbred; I take to
be a ſtronger Argument againſt Periwigs and
Shaving; than all that the Sermon contains
againſt <hi>Inoculation:</hi> Our Hairs of our Beards
were given us for an Ornament by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and it is known, that many have
catch'd great Colds with mortal DiſEaſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
upon them by Shaving. Is not a Man
anſwerable for all the bad Effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon an unwarrantable Action that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
the very Intention of Providence?</p>
            <p>The Peroration Page 29, is equal to any
Piece of the whole Performance, <hi>Let the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt and the Scoffer, the Heathen and the
Unbeliever diſclaim a Dependance upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
Let them</hi> Inoculate <hi>and be</hi> Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think this clinches the whole
Matter; and this Reverend Gentleman has
furniſh'd us with a new, ſenſible and religious
Teſt, an Atheiſt or Infidel can be found out,
as a Witch, by the Marks upon his Body: And
that, as it has been intimated already, that the
Devil was the firſt <hi>Inoculator</hi>; I think, it is
not impoſſible that the next zealous Preacher
upon this Subject may prove the Cicatrices
of <hi>Inoculation</hi> to be the Mark of the Beaſt.
Thus it appears, that the Doctors Poſition, of
the Unlawfulneſs of inflicting Diſeaſes for
good Purpoſes, is groundleſs, and contrary
to the common Uſages of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0090401000:52"/>
I have been oblig'd to be the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in anſwering this <hi>Sermon,</hi> becauſe the
Charge in it againſt the <hi>Inoculators,</hi> is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>
than that in the Letter, in as much as
immorality is a greater Fault than bad Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in Phyſick.</p>
            <p>From all that I have ſaid, I will draw this
one Concluſion; that there does not appear
as yet any Objection of Weight enough to
ſtop the Progreſs of the Practice of <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
But if upon future Trials, it ſhould
be found that the Inconveniencies do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the Advantages of it; I ſhall then
be as ready to condemn, as I am now to
juſtify it.</p>

                  <head>The CASE of Mr. DEGRAVE'S
Daughter, in a LETTER to Mr.
MAITLAND.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Find my Daughter's Caſe has made ſome
Noiſe in Town; and has been miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.
It was thus: She was <hi>Inoculated</hi> the
23d of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1721-2; and as I ſaw her daily
during the three Weeks that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
after the <hi>Inoculation,</hi> ſo I can affirm, no
<hi>Small Pox</hi> ever appear'd uponher during that
Time, but only Heats and Fluſhings, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſometimes with Heavineſs and Pain in her
Head, and a little more Quickneſs of Pulſe
than uſual, and oftentimes without any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
at all: None of thoſe Heats and Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ever came to Perfection, or to any thing
like the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> which gave my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome Uneaſineſs; and the rather, that the
other Perſons, who had been <hi>Inoculated</hi> at
the ſame Time, and in the ſame Houſe with
her, had a very fair diſtinct <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and
yet had leſs Sickneſs than She: Nor did
the Inciſions in her Arms diſcharge ſo much
and ſo long as theirs did; and therefore were
compleatly heal'd in leſs than three Weeks
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0090401000:55"/>
Time, when the Sores of the other Perſon,
were yet large and running. Thus all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of her having the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by the
<hi>Inoculation</hi> being over, ſhe was purg'd once
or twice, and then diſcharg'd from her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
the 17th of <hi>March</hi> following:
Nay, it was believ'd, ſhe never would have
that Diſtemper; for having been very much
expos'd to the Infection, when the was but
two Years of Age, and yet more when the
was about Eight, without contracting it, this
laſt Tryal being unſucceſsful, ſeem'd to give
a tolerable Ground for this Opinion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my Daughter continu'd diſcompos'd, and
out of Order, when the came Home; the
Heats and Fluſhings abovemention'd
ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
on her, though in a leſſer Degree; her
Stomach loathing Fleſh-meats, and her Reſt
diſturb'd with Dreams and Horrors. She had
likewiſe two ſmall Boils, one under her Arm,
and another on her Side: But none of theſe
Accidents were troubleſome enough to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her Attendance on her accuſtom'd Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
within and without the Houſe: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
theſe continuing for about two Months
after ſhe came Home, the was purg'd once or
twice, in order to remove them; but ſtill they
ſubſiſted upon her, not to any Degree, 'till
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> broke out upon her, which
happen'd in this Manner: Three Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſhe had heated herſelf extraordinarily;
the firſt, by going to the <hi>Camp</hi> and back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0090401000:56"/>
on Foot, in a very warm Day; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
by walking heartily to the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi>
to ſee her Brother and returning
Home; and the third Day in going and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the <hi>Play-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</hi>
As ſhe ſat at this laſt Place, the <hi>Small
Pox</hi> broke out upon her: at leaſt, I never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it upon her, 'till her Return; at which
my Daughter was ſurpriz'd, ſhe having had no
Illneſs whatever, that could hinder her Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
at the Play, and her walking Home;
or any ſuch precurſory Warnings of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
which I hear have been divulg'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
As ſoon as the <hi>Small Pox</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
ſhe recover'd her Stomach for thoſe
Fleſh-meats ſhe had loath'd before; and came
to that natural compos'd Sleep, of which ſhe
had been depriv'd ſince the <hi>Inoculation</hi>; And
ſhe having gone through the moſt favourable
Periods of that Diſtemper, ſhe got well in
Eight Days from That I perceiv'd the firſt
Eruption; ſo that I muſt conclude, from the
Symptoms which my Daughter was by Times
afflicted with, during Eleven Weeks after
ſhe had been <hi>Inoculated,</hi> that it appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to me, the <hi>Small Pox</hi> ſhe had then, was
the Effect of the <hi>Inoculation,</hi> although it has
ſhew'd itſelf much later than is uſual, after
that Operation. As to the <hi>Itch,</hi> that appear'd
upon her about the ſame Time with the
<hi>Small Pox:</hi> I can only account for it thus;
She had been Infected by her Brother, about
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0090401000:57"/>
three Months before ſhe was <hi>Inoculated,</hi> and
I thonght her cur'd of it by the ſame Means
that were Efficacious for the Cure of her
Brother. It is certain that when ſhe was, there
was no Appearance ſubſiſting of that Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
nor any Shew of it, 'till that Time the
<hi>Small Pox</hi> appear'd upon her. However, ſhe
is perfectly cur'd of the <hi>Itch,</hi> by the ſame
Means that were us'd at firſt: And I thank
God, my Daughter is at preſent as well, if
not better, in every Reſpect, than ever ſhe
was in her Life.</p>

only to add, that ſince I writ to Dr. <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
I have made the <hi>Inſition</hi> upon about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Perſons, who have all had the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
very favourably, and got thro' it with a

great deal of Eaſe. As nothing uncommon

Caſes, it will not be neceſſary to trouble you

the Royal Society did communicate to the
World ſome Letters from two very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Phyſicians reſiding in <hi>Turky,</hi> whoſe
good Senſe or Integrity we had no reaſon to
call in queſtion; theſe Gentlemen did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
aſſure us, that the Method of <hi>Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
had been for many Years practis'd in
thoſe Parts of the World, with almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Succeſs. I had, as well as all others
who have been engaged in, the Practice, with
ſufficient Sorrow and Concern, been called
to many in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> whoſe Caſes were
ſo deplorable, as to admit of no Relief. And
therefore I could not but be very thoughtful
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0090401000:59"/>
about this Method, which promiſed to carry
Perſons thro' that cruel Diſtemper, with ſo
much Eaſe and Safety. I was ſo far from
knowing that it was a Crime, that I always
thought it the Duty of our Profeſſion, to do
what we could to preſerve the Lives of thoſe
who commit themſelves to our Care. And
I know no Reaſon, why we ought not, with
all humble Thankfulneſs to Almighty God,
to make Uſe of any Means, which his good
Providence ſhall bring to Light conducing to
that End. This Matter, tho' of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
lying dormant ſo long after it was
known, is, I preſume a ſufficient Proof, that
none have been very forward to try Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.
But when we had the Account in the
publick Papers, that it had by their <hi>Royal-Highneſs</hi>'s
Command been done with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
at <hi>London,</hi> I could not be ſatisfy'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trying it here. I was ſoon convinced,
that it would be of very great Uſe; and the
more Experience I have had of it ſince, the
more I am confirm'd in the ſame Opinion. I
believe all others, who have ſeen any thing of
this Practice, are in the ſame Sentiment, and
there is no doubt, but in a few Years the
World will acknowledge the Service, which
the Royal Society have done to Mankind, in
firſt revealing to this Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> a Thing
ſo beneficial as it will certainly prove; for
tho' ſome few unfortunate Accidents may
ſometimes happen, yet theſe will be very rare
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0090401000:60"/>
in compariſon of the many ſad and diſaſtrous
Events, which this Diſtemper has been, and
ever will be very fruitful of, while it is left
to rage in its full Force and Violence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I doubt not but when you Love col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
a ſufficient number of Obſervations for
it, you will be able to demonſtrate, that the
Hazard in this Method is very inconſiderable,
in proportion to that in the ordinary way by
accidental Contagion, ſo ſmall, that it ought
not to deter any body from making uſe of it.
In order to ſatisfy my ſelf, what Proportion
the Number of thoſe that die of the <hi>Small
Pox,</hi> might bear to the whole Number that
is ſeized with the Diſtemper; in the Natural
way, I have made ſome Enquiry hereabouts,
and I ſhall take the Freedom to tranſmit the
Accounts to you, becauſe I believe you may
depend upon their being taken with ſufficient
Care and Impartiality. In <hi>Halifax</hi> ſince the
Beginning of laſt Winter, 276 have had the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> and out of that Number 43 have
died. In <hi>Rochdale,</hi> a ſmall Neighbouring
Market Town, 177 have had the Diſtemper,
and 38 have died. In <hi>Leeds,</hi> 792 have had
the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and 189 have died. It is
to be noted, that in this Town, the <hi>Small
Pox</hi> have been more favourable this Seaſon
than uſual, and in <hi>Leeds</hi> they have been more
than uſually mortal; but upon a <hi>Medium</hi> in
theſe three Towns, there have died nearly 22
out of every hundred, which is above a <hi>fifth</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0090401000:61"/> 
                     <hi>Part,</hi> of all that have been infected in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
way. I have in theſe Accounts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
my ſelf to the Limits of the Towns.
The Numbers that have had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in
the Country round about, is vaſtly greater;
but the Proportion of thoſe that die is much
the ſame. I have made the Enquiry in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Country Villages hereabouts, in ſome I
found the Proportion to be greater, in others
leſs, but in the main it is nearly the ſame.</p>

                  <p>SO conſiderable a Part of Mankind fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
periſhing by the <hi>Small Pox</hi>; and
many more of us grievouſly ſuffering by
that miſerable Diſtemper, you will allow me
to entertain you with a few more Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,

Letter upon it.</p>

The <hi>Diſtemper</hi> has lately viſited and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack'd
the City of <hi>Boſton</hi>; and in little more
than half a Year, of more then five thouſand
Perſons that have undergone it, near nine
hundred have died. But how many Lives
might have been ſaved, if our unhappy <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,</hi>
had not <hi>poiſon'd and bewitch'd</hi> our
People with a <hi>blind Rage,</hi> that has appear'd
very like a <hi>Satanick Poſſeſſion,</hi> againſt the
Method of Relief and Safety in the way of
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> Inoculated.</p>
                  <p>I prevail'd with one Phyſician, (and for it
I have had bloody Attempts made upon <hi>my
Life</hi> by ſome of our <hi>Energumens</hi>) to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Practice; and the Experiment has
been made upon almoſt three hundred Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in our Neighbourhoud, Young and Old;
(from one Year to ſeventy) weak and ſtrong;
Male and Female, White and Black; in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer,
in Autumn, in Winter, and it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to Admiration.</p>
                  <p>I cannot learn that any one has died of it;
tho' the Experiment has been made under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and marvellous Diſadvantages. Five or
ſix have died upon it, or after it, but from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſeaſes or Accidents; chiefly from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken the Infection in the common way,
by Inſpiration, before it could be given them
in this way of <hi>Tranſplantation.</hi> However at
preſent I need ſay no more of this, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

To them who are under the <hi>Inoculation</hi> of
the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> we commonly give a <hi>Vomit,</hi>
in the time of their <hi>Decumbiture,</hi> a Day or
two before the expected Eruption. One of
our Patients not vomiting ſo freely as he
would have done, thruſt a Finger or two into
his Throat, which fetch'd up, what was to be
diſcharg'd from his uneaſy Stomach; He had
but a few of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and the Puſtules
were ſufficiently of the <hi>diſtinct Sort,</hi> as it
uſes to be where they have the <hi>Small Pox In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated</hi>;
but the Fingers that had been thus
employ'd, prov'd as full as they could hold, of
the <hi>confluet Sort,</hi> which he now thought his
whole Body would have been, if we had not
in this Way prevented it.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Leigh</hi> in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> of
<hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> counts it an Occurrence worth
relating, that there were ſome Catts known
to catch the <hi>Small Pox</hi>; and paſs regularly
thro' the State of it, and then to die. We
have had among us the very ſame Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>It was generally obſerv'd and complain'd,
that the Pigeon-<hi>Houſes</hi> of the City continu'd
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and the <hi>Pigeons</hi> did not <hi>hatch</hi> or
<hi>lay</hi> as they uſed to do, all the while that the
<hi>Small Pox</hi> was in its Epidemical Progreſs:
And it is very ſtrongly affirm'd that our
Dunghil Fowl felt much of the like Effect
upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0090401000:64"/>
We have ſo many among us, who have
been viſited with the <hi>Plague</hi> in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
many Years ago, and who have never
been arreſted with the <hi>Small Pox</hi> after it, tho'
they have been expoſed as much as any other
People to it; that it now begins to obtain a
Belief with us, that they who have had the
<hi>Plague,</hi> will never have the <hi>Small Pox</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it.</p>
                  <p>I will add but one Thing more. For Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
under the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> where Life is in
Danger, after all the Methods and Medicines,
that our <hi>Sydenham</hi> and others rely upon; I
can aſſure you, we have yet found nothing ſo
ſure as this; Procure for the Patient, as early as
may be, by <hi>Epiſpaſtiks</hi> a plentiful Diſcharge
at the <hi>Hand-writs,</hi> or Ancles, or both, (I ſay
as early as my be) and keep them running
till the Danger is over. When the Venom
of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> makes an evident or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Invaſion on the Nobler Parts this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<hi>does wonderfully.</hi> I am ſorry it was
ſo late before we fell into this Way; but it
has <hi>conſtantly proſper'd:</hi> I know not that it
has once miſcarried, ſince we came into it.</p>

came from <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> to My Lord's Houſe in
<hi>London</hi> about the Time that his Children had
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> on them, with an Intent to be
Inoculated; but Matter could not be found ſo
ſoon as deſired, and the Fellow in the mean
time liv'd among the Servants that attended
on My Lord's Children: Whether he had
contracted any Infection by that Commerce
is not determin'd; or whether the Diſorder
he had on him three or four Days before he
was Inoculated, may be aſcribed to that, as
ſome have thought, or to a Change of Dyet
and Air, or only to a Cold caught; 'tis moſt
certain he complain'd then of Pain in his
Head and Bones; and was feveriſh. Doctor
<hi>Mead</hi> was conſulted, and order'd him to be
blooded, vomited, and other Medicines for
his Relief; and that the Inoculation ſhould
be Poſtpon'd till after his Recovery: For this
End he was remov'd out of My Lord's Houſe
to a Nurſe, who takes People in for the <hi>Small
Pox.</hi> He got well of his Complaints the 28<hi>th
April</hi>; and 'twas thought proper to Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

him than what is uſual before the Eruption of
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> after Inoculation. On the 6<hi>th</hi>
the Eruptions were plain of the diſtinct large
Kind, and he was relieved on that Account;
but at Night his Complaints returned on him,
and were rather more ſevere than they had
been, he having then a kind of <hi>Dilirium,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Vomitings and Stools; Theſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
the 7<hi>th,</hi> Doctor <hi>Arbothnot</hi> was call'd
to his Aſſiſtance. Doctor <hi>Mead</hi> ſaw him alſo
the next Day. They preſcrib'd ſeveral things,
which had the deſir'd Succeſs; but at this
Time his Body was cover'd with <hi>Small Pox,</hi>
and moſt of it of the confluent Sort. He
continu'd in a tolerable good Way till the
11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> when his Fever was ſharper on
him, with a <hi>Dilirium</hi> and Difficulty of
Breathing. He was then blooded and bliſterd,
but without any Effect. He died the 12<hi>th,</hi>
and was open'd the 13<hi>th.</hi> Then upon Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the Outſide of his Body, the Face and
Limbs were found as full of <hi>Small Pox</hi> as
they could hold; as were alſo two Places in
his Breaſt and Shoulders; they all appearing
of the Confluent Sort. Nothing Material
was obſerv'd in the Diſſection of his Body,
ſaving that the Lungs were Inflamed and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified;

there was a pretty large Quantity of bloody
