            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION.</head>
            <p>THE AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE has been publicly ſupported and encouraged by <hi>the Legiſlature of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> for near a century laſt paſt; ſo that the <hi>monſtrous deſtruction of the Human Species,</hi> which is <hi>annually</hi> occaſioned thereby, may certainly be eſteemed a <hi>National Crime</hi> of the moſt aggravating kind, which (according to the uſual courſe of God's Providence in the World) will probably draw down ſome exemplary vengeance upon the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Inhabitants of this Iſland! And, with reſpect to the <hi>Britiſh Colonies,</hi> the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1184900300:5"/>uncharitable practice of <hi>Slave-holding,</hi> eſpecially in the Weſt-India Iſlands and the more Southern Colonies, is grown up into a more enormous and deſtructive <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> (whether we view the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious multitudes of the <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> or the unconſcionable ſeverity of the <hi>Oppreſſors</hi>) than perhaps ever diſgraced any other Nation at any one period of time!</p>
            <p>The ſeveral attempts that have lately been made to juſtify theſe two branches of abominable National Iniquity by the Holy Scriptures, and eſpecially by the permiſſion therein granted to <hi>the Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>purchaſe</hi> and <hi>retain Slaves</hi> among them, have induced me to collect, from the Hiſtory of <hi>the Jews</hi> in the ſeveral Books of Holy Scripture, ſome plain examples of God's Vengeance upon that particular Nation, expreſsly for this kind of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;</hi> which, I hope, will ſufficiently prove that <hi>Slavery</hi> was ever deteſtable in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1184900300:6"/>the ſight of God, and conſequently that a ſpeedy Reformation is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary (as well with reſpect to the <hi>African Slave-trade,</hi> encouraged in this Kingdom, as the <hi>Toleration of Slavery</hi> in the Britiſh American Dominions) if we mean to entertain the leaſt hope of eſcaping a ſevere <hi>National Retribution,</hi> which (if we may judge by our preſent Civil Diſſentions and horrid <hi>mutual</hi> Slaughters of <hi>National Brethren</hi>) ſeem ready to burſt upon us!</p>
            <p>I am well aware, indeed, how very unfaſhionable it is, now-a-days, to quote <hi>Scripture,</hi> when matters of <hi>Law, Politics,</hi> or <hi>Trade</hi> are called in queſtion; yet I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf that the following examples, drawn from thence, are perfectly ſuitable to my preſent point, and conſequently muſt have weight to convince all perſons, who ſincerely acknowledge the <hi>Truth of the Scriptures,</hi> that we have the greateſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1184900300:7"/>reaſon to apprehend the infliction of ſome heavy Judgement from Almighty God upon theſe Kingdoms, on account of the monſtrous load of Guilt which the Britiſh Subjects, <hi>on each ſide of the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> have incurred by the <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>In ſome former Tracts I have already ſhewn that the Servitude which the Jews, by the Moſaic Law, were permitted to exact of <hi>their Brethren</hi> (even when the latter were <hi>ſold</hi> to them) was very much <hi>limited;</hi> that they were not to be treated as <hi>Bond Servants</hi> 
               <note n="(1)" place="bottom">
                  <q>If thy <hi>Brother</hi> (that dwelleth) by thee be waxen poor, and be <hi>ſold unto thee,</hi> thou ſhalt not compel him to ſerve as <hi>a Bond Servant:</hi> but as an Hired Servant, and as a Sojourner, he ſhall be with thee,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Levit. xxv. 39, 40.</note> but as <hi>Hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> that the <hi>Servitude</hi> could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be extended beyond <hi>ſeven years</hi> 
               <note n="(2)" place="bottom">
                  <q>If thou buy an Hebrew Servant, ſix years he ſhall ſerve, and in the ſeventh he ſhall go out free for nothing.</q> Exod. xxi. 2.</note>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1184900300:8"/>unleſs the Servant loved <hi>his Maſter</hi> and Condition, and voluntarily demanded<note n="(3)" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>And if the Servant ſhall <hi>plainly</hi> ſay, <hi>I love</hi> my Maſter, my Wife, and my Children; <hi>I will not go out free:</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exod. xxi. 5. Thus it is evident that the Jews could not acquire <hi>any right</hi> to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Service of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> John or Thomas, except by virtue of <hi>a voluntary Contract,</hi> which is ſomething ſimilar to that Clauſe in the Habeas Corpus Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Contract, which I thought myſelf obliged to acknowledge in my former Tract as an exception to the idea of Univerſal <hi>Freedom</hi> in this Kingdom. But in neither caſe can the <hi>Contract</hi> for Service be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;</hi> for in the latter the Contract muſt be <hi>in writing,</hi> and the ſigning be clearly proved to be <hi>a voluntary act,</hi> without the leaſt ſuſpicion of <hi>Dureſs;</hi> and in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſe it was neceſſary that the Servant ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, in <hi>a Court of Record,</hi> that he was <hi>willing</hi> to enter into ſuch a Contract; for the Hebrew <hi>Servant</hi> could not be made a <hi>Slave,</hi> unleſs he would <q>
                        <hi>plainly ſay,</hi> I love my Maſter,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>I WILL NOT GO OUT FREE: Then</q> (ſays the Text) <q>his Maſter ſhall bring him <hi>unto the</hi> JUDGES</q> (which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the public <hi>Acknowledgement</hi> neceſſary in the other caſe to be made in <hi>a Court of Record</hi>) for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this the Hebrew Maſter had no authority to bore the Servant's Ear in token of Bondage. Exod. xxi. 5, 6.</p>
               </note> of him to continued in his Service; and that, in every other caſe, it was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1184900300:9"/>abſolutely unlawful to hold a Brother Hebrew in Slavery.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe ſhewn, that, under the glorious Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, we are abſolutely bound to conſider our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as <hi>Citizens of the World;</hi> that every Man whatever, without any <hi>partial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction</hi> of Nation, Diſtance, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, muſt neceſſarily be eſteemed <hi>our Neighbour,</hi> and <hi>our Brother;</hi> and that we are abſolutely bound in Chriſtian Duty to entertain <hi>a Diſpoſition</hi> towards <hi>all Mankind</hi> as charitable and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> as that which was required of the Jews, under the Law, towards their <hi>national Brethren;</hi> and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it is abſolutely unlawful for thoſe, <hi>who call themſelves Chriſtians,</hi> to exact of <hi>their Brethren</hi> (I mean <hi>their Brethren of the Univerſe</hi>) a more burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Service than that to which the Jews were limited with reſpect to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1184900300:10"/>
               <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Houſe of Iſrael; and the Slavery, or involuntary Bondage, of <hi>a Brother Iſraelite</hi> was abſolutely forbid.</p>
            <p>Theſe premiſes naturally lead us to conſider the ſevere NATIONAL JUDGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS which the Jews brought upon themſelves principally <hi>by exceeding theſe very limitations</hi> which I have here ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and the inevitable concluſion to be drawn from theſe examples is, that we are <hi>abſolutely</hi> in danger of THE LIKE JUDGEMENTS, if we do not immediately put a ſtop to all <hi>ſimilar Oppreſſion</hi> by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Authority:</hi> becauſe an uncharitable extenſion of the <hi>ſaid limits,</hi> by thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians, will certainly be, at leaſt, <hi>as heinous in the ſight of God</hi> as the OPPRESSION OF BRETHREN under the Law; and probably much more ſo, if we conſider the purity and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which is required of all Men under the Goſpel Diſpenſation: and I have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1184900300:11"/>clearly proved (I truſt) that the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Iſraelites, to keep <hi>Bondmen of the Heathen</hi> (or more properly the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But <q>when Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, and <hi>all his Army, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth, of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and all the People, fought againſt Jeruſalem, and againſt all the Cities thereof</hi>
               </q> —then God ordered his Prophet to remind Zedekiah of that dreadful Vengeance, Defeat and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1184900300:31"/>which had ſo often before been denounced as the neceſſary conſequences of <hi>Oppreſſion and Injuſtice!</hi> — <q>Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of Iſrael</q> (<hi>viz.</hi> to Jeremiah): <q>Go, and ſpeak to Zedekiah King of Judah, and tell him, Thus ſaith the Lord; behold, I will <hi>give this City into the hand</hi> of the King of Babylon; and he ſhall burn it with fire.

            <p>The impending <hi>Vengeance</hi> being then become <hi>viſible,</hi> and conſequently more tremendous, by the near approach of the Babylonian Army, that irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtrument in the hand of God, by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1184900300:32"/>which the Jews had ſo often been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the King's ſtubborn heart began to relent, and his <hi>military confidence</hi> to forſake him, which had before encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his <hi>Injuſtice;</hi> his firmneſs in <hi>Worldly Politics</hi> was ſhaken, and yielded to a ſenſe of Guilt! It was upon this return of Conſcience and right Reaſon that Zedekiah ſent two Meſſengers, Paſſur and Zephaniah, to Jeremiah, ſaying, <q>Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us; for Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon maketh war againſt us; if ſo be the Lord will <hi>deal with us</hi> according to <hi>all his wondrous works,</hi> that he may go up from us,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See chap. xxi. ver. 1 and 2. But a very unwelcome anſwer was given to the Meſſengers, to be returned to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; for the Prophet confirmed all the heavy Judgements<note n="(12)" place="bottom">
                  <p>

And afterwards, in the 11th verſe, one of the principal cauſes of GOD's <hi>Vengeance</hi> is mentioned:—<hi>"Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence"</hi> (ſaid the Prophet) <q>is riſen up into <hi>a Rod of Wickedneſs:</hi> none of them ſhall remain, nor of their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, nor of any of their's; neither ſhall there be wailing for them.

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And again, in the 23d verſe:— <hi>"Make a Chain"</hi> (ſaid the Prophet); <q>for the Land is full of <hi>bloody Crimes,</hi> and the City is full of <hi>Violence.</hi> Wherefore <hi>I will bring the worſt</hi> of the Heathen, and they ſhall poſſeſs their houſes,</q>

               </q> Ezek. xii. 19. The nature of this baneful <hi>Violence,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned their <hi>deſtruction,</hi> is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1184900300:36"/>deſcribed by the ſame Prophet, in chap. xxii. ver. 7.— <q>

            <p>Oh that the Subjects of the Britiſh Empire would ſeriouſly compare theſe crimes with their own practices! they would then, ſurely, be ſenſible of their danger; and that they have reaſon to expect the like, or rather much heavier, Judgements, than thoſe denounced againſt the Jews!

            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, God was pleaſed to offer the Jews a Choice in <hi>their Fate,</hi>—either to forſake their wicked King (who had forfeited all right to govern, by his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Natural Right</hi>) and to fall away to the King's Enemies, the Chaldeans; or elſe to periſh miſerably in the City, and partake of it's Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!—"And unto this People" (ſaid God to the Prophet Jeremiah) <q>thou ſhalt ſay, Thus ſaith the Lord; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I ſet before you the way of <hi>Life,</hi> and the way of <hi>Death.</hi> He that abideth in this City ſhall die by the Sword, and by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence: but he <hi>that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that beſiege you, he ſhall live, and his Life ſhall be unto him for a Prey,</hi>

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Jer. xxi. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1184900300:40"/>The Prophet, however, was directed to add to his meſſage a word of advice to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> which ſhews that a ſeaſonable repentance might, even then, have ſaved the State, and turned away the impending <hi>Vengeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was ſuch advice, too, as every other Monarch, who tolerates any <hi>unnatural Bondage</hi> or <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> in his Dominions, ought ſeriouſly to conſider, becauſe the event proved it to be the beſt means of averting God's Anger, if the King had but perſevered in it.— <q>And touching <hi>the Houſe of the King of Judah</hi>
               </q> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Prophet) <q>ſay,—Hear ye the Word of the Lord, O Houſe of David—thus ſaith the Lord; <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgement</hi> in the morning, and <hi>deliver him that is ſpoiled</hi> out of the hand of the <hi>Oppreſſor,</hi> leſt my Fury go out like Fire, and burn that none can quench <hi>(it),</hi> becauſe of the evil

            </p>
            <p>The ſame advice was, by God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, repeated by the Prophet to <hi>the King himſelf</hi> IN HIS PALACE (ſee the next chapter):— <q>Thus ſaith the Lord; Go down to THE HOUSE of the King of Judah, <hi>and ſpeak</hi> THERE <hi>this word,</hi> and ſay, Hear the word of the Lord, <hi>O King of Judah,</hi> that fitteſt <hi>upon the Throne of David,</hi> thou, and thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and thy People that enter in by theſe Gates" (that is, all Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that <hi>enter in by</hi>

                        </q> can be more <hi>oppreſſive</hi> than that of detaining him in an <hi>involuntary Servitude,</hi> WITHOUT WAGES, in a miſerable, wretched <hi>Bondage,</hi> worſe than that of <hi>brute Beaſts!</hi>

                  <p>When a ſimilar warning was given by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophet to a wicked and inconſiderate Predeceſſor of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> concerning <hi>God's impending Vengeance</hi> for his miſconduct, the haughty Monarch, puffed up with vain notions of his Royal Importance, arrogantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſilence on the Prophet, becauſe he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the office of <hi>an Adviſer</hi> or <hi>Counſellor</hi> to the King without <hi>the etiquette</hi> or formality of a Court Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: —<hi>"Art thou made of the King's Council?"</hi> (ſaid the Monarch:) <q>forbear; why ſhouldeſt thou <hi>be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?</hi>
                     </q> —Upon which the Prophet <hi>forbore</hi> indeed <hi>to reaſon with him;</hi> but immediately pronounced upon him the ſevere ſentence of God's Condemnation, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>I know that God hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt done this, and haſt not hearkened unto <hi>my Counſel:</hi>

               </note>;" for he boldly warned the Monarch by the tremendous examples of God's Judgements upon three of his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Predeceſſors in the Kingdom; two of whom were <hi>his own Brothers,</hi> the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1184900300:45"/>Sons of King Joſiah; and the third <hi>his own Nephew,</hi> whom he immediately ſucceeded. They were all particularly mentioned by him in the proper order of their reſpective reigns, as we find by the copy of his Meſſage or Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, preſerved in the Collection of his Prophecies; and, throughout the ſaid Remonſtrance, frequent alluſions are made to the principal cauſes of the failure and deſtruction of each of them, which afford a moſt ſtriking and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting Leſſon to Kings and Governors <hi>in general;</hi> but it muſt have been <hi>more particularly</hi> affecting to Zedekiah, if we conſider his critical ſituation at the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1184900300:46"/>time the Meſſage was delivered to him, and that the Examples of <hi>Vengeance,</hi> to which the Prophet referred him, were <hi>actually accompliſhed</hi> in the Perſons of his <hi>neareſt Relations</hi> and <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> who were ſucceſſively <hi>deprived of their Royal Dignity,</hi> and carried away IN CHAINS into a <hi>ſlaviſh Captivity;</hi> the very fate which, the Prophet aſſured him, was to be his own!</p>
            <p>But before I recite the remainder of God's Meſſage to <hi>the Court of Zedekiah,</hi> it will be neceſſary for me to give ſome general account of that Monarch and of his immediate Predeceſſors, in order that the Remonſtrance, in which they are all diſtinctly mentioned, may be more eaſily underſtood by the generality of Readers. It will likewiſe be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to prove, that the whole 22d Chapter of Jeremiah is included in that <hi>Meſſage,</hi> or <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1184900300:47"/>the Prophet was then to deliver in the preſence of the <hi>whole Court</hi> of Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah.

            <p>Zedekiah was the Son of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince Joſiah King of Judah, on whoſe account, expreſsly, <hi>the dreadful Vengeance,</hi> due to that wicked Nation, was poſtponed for ſeveral years, <hi>viz.</hi> till after his death.</p>

                  <p>—"this <hi>Johanan</hi>" (ſays Biſhop Patrick) <q>is thought by many to be the ſame with <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Joſiah</hi> in the Throne.

                     </q> (This is God's <hi>Law of Retribution, Evil</hi> for <hi>Evil, Meaſure</hi> for <hi>Meaſure,</hi> which nothing but Repentance and Conformity to God's Laws could avert.) <q>And thou ſhalt ſay unto them, Thus faith the LORD; <hi>if ye will not hearken to me,</hi> TO WALK IN MY LAW, which I have ſet <hi>before you,</hi> to hearken to the words of my Servants the Prophets, whom I ſent unto you, both riſing up early and ſending <hi>(them),</hi> but ye have not hearkened.

            <p>In the ninth year of Zedekiah the impending Vengeance became viſible by the near approach of the Babylonian Army, as I have before remarked in page 28: for then began to be fulfilled what had been foretold not only in the fourth year of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> but, probably,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1184900300:127"/>alſo in the reign of Joſiah. Compare Jer. i. 15. with xxv. 9. In the former, God declares,— <q>
                  <hi>I will call all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Kingdoms of the North,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the latter, <q>Behold, <hi>I will ſend and take all the Families of the North,</hi> ſaith the Lord</q> (thereby marking his abſolute direction of them), <q>and Nebuchadrezzar the King of Babylon MY SERVANT, and will bring them <hi>againſt this Land,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And accordingly, after Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar had ſtrengthened his Empire, by reducing to his obedience all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> as well as the <hi>Syrian</hi> Dominion (which latter lay to <hi>the North</hi> of Judaea, and extended quite up to <hi>Armenia,</hi> the <hi>Armenians</hi> themſelves being no other than <hi>Syrians;</hi> for <hi>Aram</hi> is the proper name in Scripture for <hi>Syria</hi>), he compelled the conquered Nations to aſſiſt him in reducing others to a like

            </p>
            <p>Commentators have generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Divine Meſſage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the 22d chapter (from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the 19th verſe at leaſt), was not delivered to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> but to <hi>Jehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akim,</hi>

(1 John iii.8.)—And though Men are not ſo loſt to Common Senſe in theſe more enlightened Days of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as perſonally to worſhip at the Shrines of <hi>Demons</hi> or <hi>Devils,</hi> yet they ſerve the <hi>Devil</hi> as <hi>effectually as ever</hi> to the Deſtruction of their own Souls, by yielding to his temptations, whether through <hi>Mammon</hi> or <hi>Carnal Luſt!</hi>—For— <q>

The dangerous prevalency of the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Empire in theſe kingdoms, through the <hi>ſervice</hi> of <hi>Mammon</hi> and of <hi>Carnal Luſt,</hi> may be known by the following general Marks. 1ſt. By the ſhameful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Time-ſerving, Venality,</hi> and <hi>Private Intereſt,</hi> which is every where predominant, to the deſtruction of <hi>true Loyalty</hi> and National Independence. 2dly, By the increaſed number of notorious <hi>Gaming Houſes,</hi> which are frequented by the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom for Days and Nights together! 3dly, By the multitudes of poor female <hi>Proſtitutes</hi> which ſwarm in the publick Streets; and alſo by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Maſquerades and Midnight Balls, which apparently afford, to the idle and vicious part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the moſt dangerous opportunities of triumphing over unwary virtue, and of ſpreading the baneful taint of <hi>Proſtitution</hi> amongſt females of ſuperior Rank, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many perſons of Rank and figure in the gay World are become almoſt as notoriouſly <hi>dedicated</hi> (as it were) to <hi>Venus,</hi> or the Aſſyrian Goddeſs <hi>Mylitta</hi> (See Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Lib. i. p. 83.) as ever the Heathens were of old! But the greateſt mark of <hi>National Infamy,</hi> and of Satan's Empire amongſt us, (and that, indeed, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I am engaged more particularly to oppoſe) is the ſhameful public encouragement given to the <hi>African Slave Trade;</hi> wherein the Service of <hi>Mammon</hi> and of the <hi>Devil</hi> is rendered apparent by the <hi>horrible deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the human Species</hi> which it annually occaſions!

We are now daily taking up the principal negroes of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent gangs; ſome of the are HANGED, ſome BURNT, and others BEHEADED, after being firſt STRANGLED. Their HEADS ARE FIXED ON POLES ALONG THE HIGH ROADS, as a warning to the reſt.</q>

                        <p>A Friend of mine aſſured me that he was preſent ſome years ago at one of theſe horrid executions; when a poor negro man was abſolutely BURNT ALIVE! The unfortunate man was faſtened down to the ground with forked ſticks drove into the earth, and ſire was placed at his feet, and was gradually removed nearer to the vital parts as the limbs were conſumed! The poor fellow bore the exquiſite Torture without the leaſt complaint, looking great part of the time on thoſe who ſtood near him with a ſullen contempt.</p>

                  <p>— "Wicked men" (ſaid he) <q>may be happy and proſperous here, and good men may ſuffer many afflictions and tribulations, without any the leaſt reflection on the juſtice or goodneſs of the great Governor of the World: becauſe there is a farther day reſerved for the adjuſting all men's rewards, according to their works.

            <p>The whole tenour of the Scriptures teaches us, that SLAVERY was ever <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable in the ſight of God,</hi> inſomuch that it has generally been denounced (and, of courſe, inflicted) as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt abandoned Sinners; of which I have already given a great variety of inſtances.</p>

            <p>Nay, THE VENGEANCE was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced particularly againſt the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans (and the cauſe of it, alſo, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) <hi>long before they were guilty of the offence,</hi> as I have before remarked, even while the Jews, the Nation vindicated by this puniſhment, were exerciſing that <hi>Tyranny</hi> at home for which they

                        <p>The learned Judge Blackſtone, in his Commentaries, book I. c. 11. p. 377. informs us, that <q>ELECTION <hi>was, in</hi> VERY EARLY TIMES, <hi>the uſual mode of Elevation to the</hi> EPISCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAL CHAIR <hi>throughout all Chriſtendom; and this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>was promiſcuouſly performed by the</hi> LAITY, <hi>as well as by the</hi> CLERGY,</q> ("<hi>per</hi> CLERUM <hi>&amp;</hi> POPULUM:") for which he cites very ample authorities. But afterwards a complaint of <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Elections,</hi> together with the ſuppoſed Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of granting the Inveſtiture of <hi>Temporalities</hi> (though the <hi>Temporalities,</hi> being originally granted to ſupport the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the Office, cannot reaſonably be ſo far drawn from the firſt intention, as to deprive the Office of that real <hi>Dignity</hi> which ariſes from a free Election) ſerved the deſigns of Emperors and Kings as <hi>a pretence</hi> to invade <hi>the Freedom of Election;</hi> and the ſame <hi>pretence</hi> of TUMULT proved equally favourable to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite deſigns of Popes; ſo that theſe jarring intereſts ſeemed united, however, in their endeavours (as it were by one Spirit of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>) to deprive the Church of her <hi>ancient Right,</hi> which
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:1184900300:337"/>(had it been maintained) would probably have prevented moſt of the future uſurpations of the <hi>Papal Antichriſt;</hi> and therefore <q>
                              <hi>the Policy of the Court of Rome at the ſame time began by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to</hi> EXCLUDE THE LAITY <hi>from any ſhare in theſe</hi> ELECTIONS,</q> (ſays the learned Judge Blackſtone,) <q>

                           </q> 1 Blackſtone, c. 11. p. 378. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ground for the complaint of <hi>tumult</hi> in theſe <hi>Elections</hi> was probably occaſioned by the neglect of that unexceptionable Apoſtolic mode of Election deſcribed in Acts i. 15 to 26; for when Chriſtianity began to be corrupted by Vows of <hi>Celibacy,</hi> and other Popiſh and Diabolical Doctrines, the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> began to have oppoſite intereſts to ſerve (which ought never to be) in the Choice of their Biſhop, and, of courſe, the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties would reciprocally depend upon their own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, zeal, or addreſs for ſucceſs in the <hi>Election;</hi> ſo that <hi>Tumult</hi> (the old complaint) muſt be the neceſſary conſequence; whereas had it been an indiſpenſible form to nominate TWO qualified perſons (viz. either <hi>two</hi> by the promiſcuous ſuffrages of both parties, or <hi>one</hi> by each party), and afterwards, <hi>in ſolemn prayer,</hi> to ſubmit the final deciſion to the Providence of God by a Lot (as in the <hi>Apoſtolic Election</hi>), there could be no room for conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the undue influence and partiality of <hi>Individuals</hi> would be effectually checked; and, above all, the joint prayers of <hi>both parties,</hi> in an appeal to God's deciſion, would certainly add <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity</hi> (inſtead of <hi>Tumult</hi>) to the <hi>Election,</hi> if not alſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional

Teſt. p. 460. This remark opens to us a very ſatisfactory reaſon why the Apoſtles diſcontinued the primitive mode of <hi>Election,</hi> and took upon themſelves the appointment of <hi>Biſhops:</hi> for while they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with manifeſt <hi>ſupernatural power</hi> in working Miracles, their authority to <hi>appoint Biſhops,</hi> without the formulary precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the firſt precedent, could not be queſtioned, becauſe their appointment of Biſhops was clearly the appointment of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> but when theſe <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts ceaſed in the Church, the primitive mode of Election became once more deſirable, as being beſt ſuited to the <hi>ordinary</hi> ſtate of the Church in all ſucceeding ages. This is not a ſingular opinion of my own: the learned Bengelius (p. 459) refers us not only to thoſe who have thought as I do, but alſo to examples of it's having been really practiſed in Epiſcopal Elections:— <q>

                              <hi>Proceſſu au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtemporis</hi> ULSTANUS (ELECTO <hi>ad Archiepiſcopatum Ebora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſem</hi> ALDREDO) <hi>unanimi conſenſu, tam</hi> CLERI <hi>quam</hi> TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS PLEBIS, <hi>Rege inſuper ut quem vellent ſibi eligerent prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulem &amp; animarum Paſtorem annuente,</hi> IN EPISCOPUM <hi>ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem loci</hi> ELIGITUR.</q> P. 20. And even in later times, when <hi>the Romiſh Corruptions</hi> had ſo far prevailed as to exclude the LAITY from Elections, yet the Clergy ſtill enjoyed <q>
                              <hi>the free right of electing their Prelates, whether Abbots or Biſhops;</hi>
                           </q> for the learned Judge Blackſtone informs us, that <hi>this right</hi> was granted in a charter <q>
                              <hi>to all the Monaſteries and Cathedrals in the Kingdom</hi>
                           </q> by King John, ſee vol. i. p. 379; and alſo that <q>
                              <hi>this grant was expreſsly recognized and confirmed in King John's</hi>

                           <hi>Ibid.</hi> This Statute firſt gave <hi>parliamentary authority,</hi> indeed, to the King's <hi>Congé D' Eſlire</hi> (though it was in uſe long before), and acknowledges the King's Right of <hi>Aſſent</hi> or Approbation <hi>"after the Election;"</hi> yet it contains nothing which can remove the prudent and reaſonable limitation to which that <hi>Aſſent</hi> or <hi>Approbation</hi> was formerly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>viz.</hi> that it <q>WAS NOT TO BE DENIED WITHOUT A REASONABLE AND LAWFUL CAUSE.</q> Judge Blackſtone, b. i. c. 11. p. 379. And this very Act (which was manifeſtly ordained to reſtrain the ſimoniacal practices and ſhameful uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Biſhops of Rome) expreſsly acknowledges the Right of FREE ELECTIONS in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                           <q>that the FREE ELECTIONS of the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and all other Dignities and Benefices ELECTIVE <hi>in England,</hi> ſhall hold,</q>
