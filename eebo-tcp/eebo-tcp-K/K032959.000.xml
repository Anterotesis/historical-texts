            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Samſon, failed from the Downs on the 23d. of April, 1755, in Company with the Pelham, the Houghton, the Streatham, and the Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, all in the Service of the Eaſt India Company, and in about ſeven Days got clear of the Channel; during this Time C. pt. Samſon perceived that his Ship failed faſter than any of the others, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It now app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ared either that he had been miſtaken in ſuppoſing

his Ship to out ſail the reſt of the Fleet, or that he had loſt Time by the Courſe he ſteered, for he found the Pelham and the Streatham had reached the Bay two Hours before him. The Houghton arrived ſoon afterwards, but the Edgecourt did not come till the 26th.</p>
            <p>On the 27th of May, the Doddington, Pelham, Streath am and Houghton, having taken in their Water, proceeded on the Voyage together, leaving the Edgecourt in the Road: they continued in Company ſteering S. by E. S E. till the 28th. when Capt. Samſon thinking the Courſe too far eaſterly, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doddington to be kept South, which again ſepareted her from the reſt of the Fleet, and after a fine Voyage of ſeve-Weeks ſhe made the Land of the Cape of Good Hope. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt doubled the Cape, a new Departure was taken from de Agulhas on the 8th of July; and the Veſſel having ſteered Eaſtward about 24 Hours, between the Latitude of 35d, 30 m, and 36d. the Captain ordered her to be kept E. N. E.</p>
            <p>In this Courſe ſhe continued till about a Quarter before One in the Morning of Thurſday, July 17, when ſhe ſtruck: The Officer from whoſe Journal this Account is taken, was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in his Cabin, but being ſuddenly awaked from the Shock, he ſtarted up in the utmoſt Conſternation, and made all the haſt he could to get upon Deck; here all the Terrors of his Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ruſhed upon him at once, he ſaw the Men daſhed to and fro by the Violence of the Sea that rolled over them, and the Ship breaking to Pieces at every Stroke of the Surge; he crawled over, with great Difficulty, to the larboard Side of the Quarter-deck, which lay the higheſt out of Water, and there he found the Captain, who ſaid very little more than they muſt all periſh; in a few Minutes a Sea parted them, and he ſaw him no more. He made ſhift to get back to the Quarter-deck, but he was very much bruiſed, and the ſmall Bone of his Left Arm was broken; all the reſt of the Ship was under Water, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0090500800:4"/>
ſhattered to Pieces. In this dreadful Situation, expecting every Moment to be ſwallowed up he heard ſomebody cry out Land! Upon this he looked eagerly about him, but tho he ſaw ſomething which he ſuppoſed was taken for Land, he believed it to be only the Range of the Sea on the other Side of the Breakers; at the ſame Moment the Sea broke over him with great Violence, and not only forced him from his Hold, but ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ed him by a violent Blow upon his Eye; tho' from this Time he lay inſenſible 'till after Day light, yet he continued upon the Wreck, and when he recovered he found himſelf made faſt to a Plank by a Nail that had been forced into his Shoulder; beſides the Pain that he felt from his Wounds and Bruiſes, he was now ſo benumbed with Cold, that he could ſcarce move either hand or foot; he called out as loud as he could, and was heard by the People on the Rocks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they could give him no Aſſiſtance, ſo that it was a conſiderable Time before he could diſengage himſelf and crawl on Shore.</p>
            <p>This Shore was a barren uninhabitod Rock, in the Lat. of 33d. 44. m. South, and diſtant about 250 Leagues Eaſt of the Cape of Good Hope. Here were now met Mr. Evan Jones, Chief Mate, Mr. Jobn Collet 2d, Mr. William Webb 3d, and Mr. S, Powel 5th Mate; Richard Topping, Carpenter; Neal Bothwell and Nathaniel Chiſholm, Quarter Maſters; Daniel Ladova, the Captain's Steward; Henry Sharp, the Surgeon's Servant; Thomas Arnold, a Black, and John Mackdowal, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Captain.

Theſe Perſons being 23 in Number, were all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of 276 Souls that were on board when the Ship ſtruck.</p>
            <p>Their firſt Care was to ſearch among the Things which had been thrown upon the Rocks from the Ship, for ſomething to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0090500800:5"/>
cover them, in which they ſucceeded beyond their Hopes. The next Thing they felt the Want of was Fire, and this was not ſo eaſily ſupplied. ſome of them attempted to kindle two Piecee of Wood, by rubbing them together, but wirhout Succeſs; others went peeping about among the Rocks to pick up fome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might ſerve for a Flint and Steel; after long Search they ſound a Box that contained two Gun Flints. and a broken File; this was a joyful Acquiſition, but ſtill they had nothing that would kindle from a Spark, and till ſomething like Tinder could be procured, the Flint and Steel were uſeleſs; a farther Search was therefore undertaken with inexpreſſible Sollitude and Anxiety; a Cask of Gunpowder was at laſt diſcovered, but to their great Diſappointment it proved to be wet, however, upon a a near Examination, a ſmall Quantity was ſound at the Bottom of the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, which had ſuffered no Damage; ſome of this they bruiſed on a Linnen Rag, which ſerved them very well ſor Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a Fire was ſoon made; the bruiſed and wounded ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about it, and the reſt went in Search of other Neceſſeries, without which the Rock could afford them but a ſhort Reſpite from Deſtruction. In the Afternoon a Box of Wax C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndles, and a Caſe of Brandy were brought in, both were extremely welcome, eſpecially the Brandy, of which every one thought it adviſeable to take a Dram; ſoon after ſome others of the Party, returned with an Account that they had diſcovered a Cask full almoſt of freſh Water, which was yet of more Conſequence than the Brandy, and Mr. Jones brought in ſome Piece of Salt Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k, and ſoon after others arrived driving before them ſeven Hogs, which had come on Shore alive; ſome Casks of Beer, Water, and Flour, were alſo ſeen at a Diſtance. But it was not then poſſible to get them over the Rocks: the Approach of Night made it neceſſary to provide ſome Shelter, all Hands therefore were employ'd to make a Tent of ſome Canv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s that had been thrown on Shore, which was at laſt effected, though it was ſo ſmall for want of more Sail Cloth, that it would not hold them all. The Iſland was much frequented by a kind of Water-f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul,

ſomething larger than a Duck, called a Gannet and the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of it was covered with their Durg; upon this Part they were obliged to build their Tent, for fear of being overflowed, and they placed thoſe who could not walk, under the Tent, and kindled a Fire near them; but as they had paſſed the Day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Food, they paſſed the Night without Reſt beſides, that they were ſunk a Foot in the Fowl's Dung, the Night was ſo tempeſtious that the Wind blew away their Fire, and before it could be ſcraped together again, the Rain put it out.</p>
            <p>In the Morning, which was Friday July the 18th, thoſe that were able went again about the Rock, to ſee what could be ſaved from the Wreck but to their great Mortification, they found all the Casks which they had ſeen the Night before, except one of Beer, and one of Flour, ſtaved to Pieces againſt the Rocks; ſoon after theſe were ſecured the Tide flowed up and put a Stop to the Work of that Day. The Company therefore was called together to eat their firſt Meal, and ſome Raſhers of Pork were broiled upon the Coals for Dinner,</p>
            <p>The ſitting down thus deſolare and forlorn, to a Repaſt, which they uſed to ſhare in the convivial Charfulneſs, which naturally aroſe from the conſciouſneſs of preſent Plenty, and the Hope of future, ſtruck them them with ſuch a Senſe of their Condition, that they burſt into paſſionate Lamentations, wringing their Hands and looking round then with all the Wildnſs of Deſpair; in ſuch Tumult of Mind, our Thoughts hurry from one Object to another, to fix if poſſible, upon ſomething that may afford Comfort; and one of the Company recollecting, that as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter was among them they might build a Sloop, if they could procure Materials and Tools, mentioned this as a Subject of Hope to the reſt; every Man's Attention was immediately turned upon the Carpenter, who declared that he had no doubt but he ſhould be able to build a Sloop that would carry them all to ſome Port of Safety, if Tools and Materials could be found; at that Time
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0090500800:7"/>
indeed, they had no rational Proſpect of procuring either, any more than or being able to vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſſibility, than they ſeemed to think it neither Improbable nor Difficult; they began to eat without farther repining, and from that Moment the Boat engroſſed their whole Converſation, and they not only debated upon the Size and Manner of Rigging her but to what Port they ſhould ſteer her, whether the Cape or Delegoa.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they had finiſhed their Repair, ſome went in ſearch of Tools, and others to mend the Tent, no Tools however were found that Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, July</hi> 19. They ſecured four Butts of Water, one Cask of Flower, one Hogſhead of Brandy, and one of their little Boats, which had been thrown up by the Tide, in a ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Condition; but they found no Tools except a Scraper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, July</hi> 20 They had the good Fortune to find a Hamper, in which there were Files, Sail-needles, Gimblets, and an Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth Compas Card. They alſo found two Quadrants, a Car-Penter's Adze, a Chiſſel, and three Sword-blades, and a Cheſt of Treaſurer This ſearch was made very early in the Morning, as there had been a prodigious Surf rolling in all the Day before, by which it was reaſonable to ſuppoſe ſomething would be thrown up. At Ten o'Clock they all aſſembled to Prayers, and did not go out again till after Dinner, when they found moſt of the Packets of Letters belonging to the King, and the Company; theſe they carefully dried and laid by.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day, as they were ſearching about the Beach, they found the Boly of a Gentlewoman, which they knew to be that of Mrs. Collet, the Wife of their ſecond Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Having thus paid the Deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On Monday, July 21, they ſecured ſome more Water and Pork, and found ſome Timber, Plank, Cordage, and Canvas. Theſe they ſecured with great joy for the Boat, though as yet they were in want of many Implements, without which it was impoſſible for the Carpenter to work. He had juſt finiſhed a Saw, but he had neither Hammer nor Nails. It happened, however, that one of the Seamen, Hendrick Scantz, a Sweed, having picked up an old Pair of Bellows, brought them to his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and told them, that he had been by Profeſſion a Smith, and that with theſe Bellows and a Forge, which he hoped they would be able, by his Direction, to build, he could furniſh the Carpenter with all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k. In the mean time they ſaw their Friends ſtill driving out to Sea at a great Rate, and were juſt giving them up to inevitable Deſtruction. when the Carpenter ſent them Word, that he would make the little Boat ſo tight, that ſhe ſhould not take in Water faſter than one Man could lave it out. This gave them freſh hope, and every one was ready to venture out for the deliverance of their Friends. The Carpenter diſpatched the Boat in about a Quarter of an Hour, and ſhe ſoon overtook the Float, and took Collet and Yets on Board. They ſoon found, however, that the Water gained very ſaſt upon them; notwithſtanding their utmoſt Efforts, and when ſhe came in, ſhe was ſo full of Water, that in a few Minutes ſhe muſt have ſunk.</p>

On this Day, therefore, Bothwell, Roſenbury, and Taylor, ſet out on the Diſcovery, and at Night the People on ſhore made a large Fire on the higheſt Part of the Rock, as a Signal to them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Sept.</hi> 6. The Weather having been fair for 40 Hours, they impatiently expected the Return of the Boat. At Moon they became very uneaſy at having ſeen nothing of her; but juſt as they were ſitting down to Dinner, they were agreeably ſurpriſed by two of their People, who came running over the Rocks crying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut <hi>the Boat! the Boat!</hi> They all ſtarted up overjoyed at the Sound, and ran to ſee her come in, with great Hopes that ſhe had ſucceded; but they ſoon diſtinguſhed, that ſhe was rowed only by one Man, who plied both Oars: They concluded, therefore, that the other two were loſt or detained; but preſently they ſaw another get up from the Boottom of the Boat, where it was ſuppoſed he had lain down for ſome ſhort Refreſhment, and then the Boat came forward ſomewhat faſter, though ſtill at a ſlow Rate. The Dinner was now entirely forgot, and after they had waited an Hour on the Beach with the ut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſt Impatience, the Boat came in. The two Men were Roſenbury and Taylor, who, the Moment they ſtept on Shore, threw themſelves on their Knees, and in a ſhort but earneſt Ejaculation returned Thanks to God for having once more ſet them ſafe upon this Place, which barren and deſolate as it was, they now conſidered as an Aſylum from a Situation of much greater Diſtreſs. Having exerted their utmoſt Effort to bring the Boat in, their Strength foreook them at once, and they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0090500800:13"/>
and Water. They dreſſed them ſome Fiſh, with as much haſte as they could, and perceiveing that they were quite exhauſted with Watching and Labour, they left them when they had eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Meat, without asking any Queſtions, and they immediately fell aſleep. The Behaviour of theſe honeſt Sailors to their Meſs-mates, was an uncommon Inſtance of hearty Kindneſs, and generous Self-denial; the Impatience of their Curioſity muſt have been both encreaſed and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Proportion, as they were intereſted in the Account that was to gratify it; yet even this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, in which Life itſelf was concerned, they had the kindneſs and the Fortitude to repreſs, rather than delay the Refreſhment of others for its Gratification.</p>
            <p>The Account which was given by the two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers when they awoke was to this Effect:</p>
            <p>About three o'Clock on the Day they ſet out, they got round a Point, about ſix Leagues Eaſt of the Rock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Bothwell was drowned, and the other two, who reached the Shore in an exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſeeble Condition, were left deſtitute of every kind of Proviſion, except a ſmall Keg of Brandy, As ſoon as they had a little recovered their Strength, they crawled along the Shore to ſeek for the Boat, having no other hope of ſhelter from the wild Beaſts, which might be expected to come abroad in the Night. After ſome Search they found her, but they were too weak to get her up, and Darkneſs coming on, they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to lie down upon the Sand, with no other Covering than the Branches of a Tree, and in this Condition they paſſed the Night. As ſoon as the Morning dawned, they went again to look for the Boat, which the Surf had driven from where they left her. As they walked along the Coaſt they ſaw a Man and advanced towards him, upon which he ran away into the Woods that lay near the Beach, and were very thick. They went on, and ſoon after diſcovered the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their Companion, Bothwell, which had been dragged up the ſand a conſiderable diſtance from the Water, and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to Pieces by ſome wild Beaſt. This terified them exceedingly, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the Beat, the dread of paſſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Night on Shore; detirmined them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to return. They were, however, prevented
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0090500800:15"/>
in the Attempt by a Freſh Gale at Weſt, and before they could put back, the Boat overſet with them a Second time, and drove with them along Shore. After much ſtruggleing and Swimming they got once more ſafe on the Land; but as they had now been faſting ever ſince Three o'Clock the Day before, they were fainting with Hunger and Fateigue. It happened, however, that they met with a Fruit reſembleing an Apple, which they eagerly gathered and eat, without knowing either its name or its Quality. By good forune, it did them no harm; and being ſomewat refreſhed by their antidiluvian Repaſt, they made ſhift to haul the Boat on Shore, and turning it upſide down, they crept under it to ſleep, being thus very well ſheltered from the Sun, and ſecured againſt the wild Beaſts. Thoſe who know the irreſiſtable Power of Sleep, after long Watching and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Labour, will not conclude that their firſt Slumber was ſhort, becauſe their ſituation was incommodious or inſecure; they waked, however, before the next Morning, and peeping under the Edge of the Boat, they could diſcern the Feet of ſeveral Creatures, which by their Claws they ſuppoſed to be Tygers, paſs by them to and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This was a ſufficient Motive to remian in their reſting Place till the Morning, when they looked out again, and ſaw the Feet of a Man. Upon this Diſcovery they came from under the Boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Savage, and two other Men and a Boy, who were at ſome Diſtance. When they had got all together, and were a little recovered from their Surprize, they made Signs to the Sailors to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which they endeavoured to do, though they were able to move but very ſlowley</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before they had gone far from the Boat, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Number of the Natives ran down upon them with their Lances. It happened that Roſenbury had picked up the Maſt of the Boat, and a Piſtol which had been waſhed on Shore, as he went along; being thus armed, when the Indians came down upon him, and being beſides unable to run, he imprudently turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, and exerting all his Strength, advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in a threatening Manner, ſuppoſing that they would have been ſeized with a Panic, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into the Woods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happended, however, that he was miſtaken; for inſtead of running away, they ſurrounded him, and began to whet their Lances. Taylor thought it was now Time to try what could be done by Supplication; he therefore threw himſelf on his Knees, and in a piteous Tone cried out for Mercy; but Roſenberry took Refuge in the Water. The Savages immediately came up to Taylor, and began to ſtrip him: he ſuffered them quierly to take his Shoes and his Shirt, but when they attacked his Trowſers he made ſome Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0090500800:17"/>
and by his Geſtures, intreated they would not leave him quite naked, upon which they thought fit to deſiſt. They then made Sings for Roſenberry to come to them, who was all this while ſwimming about in the Sea; but he refuſed, and made Signs that they would kill him. They then pointed to Taylor, intimating that they had not killed him: Upon this he came forward, and having firſt thrown them his Piſtol, and all his Cloaths but his Shirt, he ventured to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into their Hands, When he came up they offered him no Violence, only held the Boat's Maſt and the Piſtol to him, by Way of deriding the Folly of his Attempt to fright them. They ſeemed to be very much pleaſed with the Cloathes, which they divided among them as far as they would go. They then began to rifle the Boat, and having taken all the Rope they could find, and the Hook by which the Rudder hung to the Stern-poſt, they began to knock the ſtern to peices, for the Iron which they ſaw was about it. Next to knocking the poor Wretches on the Head, this was the worſt Thing they could do, and, rough as they were, they burſt into Tears at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>njury that was offered to their Boat, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Savages to deſiſt, with ſuch Agony of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that they ſuffered the Boat to remain as they found it. Encouraged by this Appearance of Placability and Kindneſs, and urged by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they asked by Sings, for ſomething to eat,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0090500800:18"/>
this Requeſt was alſo granted, and having given them ſome Roots, they again made Signs for them to depart; upon which they once more launched their Boat, and go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into it, but the Wind blowing ſtrong from the Weſt, they could not put off. The Natives perceiving that they were willing to comply with their Deſires, but not able, covered them with the Boat to ſleep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and left them as they had ſound them. The next Morning, the Weather being fine, and the Wind eaſterly, they launched the Boat a third Time, and returned back to the Rock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From this Time till</hi> Sunday <hi>the 29th of</hi> Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>the Carpenter and Smith continued to work upon the Boat, and the People were buſy in getting in from Time to Time what was thrown up from the Wreck, particularly Cordage and Canvas, to rig the Boat, and ſome Casks of freſh Water, which they were very ſolicitous to keep for Sea Stores, as their Eſcape in the Boat ſcarce depended leſs upon freſh Water than upon the Sails themſelves. On this Day, after they had been at Prayers, a Duty which was regularly and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly performed every Sunday, the Officers diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Cheſt of Treaſure had been broke open, and the greater Part of it taken away and concealed. It may perhaps be thought ſtrange, that People, whom Danger had made religious, ſhould at the ſame Time be guilty of Theft; but, upon this Occaſion, it ſhould be remembred, that as ſoon as a Ship is loſt, the Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0090500800:19"/>
loſe their Pay, and the Captain his Command; every Diſtinction and Subordination that ſubſifled on Ship-board is at an End; and whatever is caſt aſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e from the Wreck is, by the Sailors, conſidered as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Property. The Men, therefore, who thought fit ſecretly to take what they deemed their Share of this Treaſure, were not, in their own Opinion, guilty of Diſhoneſty, but intended only to ſecure what they feared the Officers would monopolize, and by this Means prevent Diſputes, which, in their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, might produce fatal Effects. The Officers, however, when they diſcovered what had been done, and found that nodody would own they knew any Thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, propoſed to write the Form of an Oath, and adminiſter it ſeparately to every Individual, the Officers to take it firſt. But to this the Majority immediately objected; for tho' they might not ſuppoſe they had committed a Crime by taking the Treaſure, they knew it would be not only immoral, but impious, to ſwear they had not taken it. As the Minority were not in a Condition to ſupport their Motion, the Affair was ſuffered to reſt, without farther Enquiry or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 6th of October they found a Fowling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; this was a joyful Acquiſition, and though the Barrel was much bent, it was ſoon made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable by the Carpenter, and uſed with great Succeſs in ſhooting the Birds, which before they had no way of taking, but by knocking them down with a Stick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0090500800:20"/>
               <hi>On Friday October</hi> II. <hi>they perceived the Gannets, which had of late forſaken them, to hover again about the Rock in great Numbers, and were in hopes they would ſettle to lay their Eggs, in which, to their great Joy, they were not diſappointed; for after this Time they were conſtantly ſupplied with Eggs in great Plenty, till the beginning of January, when the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of laying was paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Sunday October 20. Mr. Collet, Mr. Web, and two others, ventured out once more on the Float, but the Wind ſpringing up very freſh, the Float broke looſe, and drove with them to the other ſide of the Rocks. The Wind ſtill riſing, and the Sea running very high, it was impoſſible for the Boat to put out; they were therefore obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to remain all Night among the Seals on the Rocks, without any Shelter or Refreſhment. But in this Situation, how dreadful, they received great Comfort from reflecting how much more dreadful it would have been, if inſtead of being driven to the Rocks, their Float had been carried out to Sea. It was Noon, the next Day before the Wind abated, and then the Boat ventured off; but as the Waves ſtill ran high, it could bring in no more than two at a time, leaving the Float be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. They had now ſome rainy Weather, which proved very acceptable, as they contrived to ſave ſome of the Water for Sea Stores; but they were ſtill in great want of Bread, having lived
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0090500800:21"/>
many Days on ſhort Allowance. As a laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, they thought of building an Oven, for they had ſome Burrels of Flower, though they had no Bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d: In this Attempt they ſucceeded, beyond their Expectations, and were able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their Flower into tolerable Biſcuit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Biſcuit, however, was at length ſo mar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that they were obliged to live upon a few Ounces a Day, without Brandy, of which only a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>available for the Uſe of the Carpenter. They were alſo ſo ſhort of Water, that of this they were allowed but Half a Pint a Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Condition, however, they happily in a great Degree preſerved their Health and Vigour, and on the 16th of February they launched their Boat, and called her the <hi>Happy Deliverance.</hi> On the 17th they got their little Pittance of Stores on Board, and on the 18th they ſet ſail from the Rock, on which they had lived juſt ſeven Months, and to which at parting they gave the Name of <hi>Birds Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they embarked in their boat, the <hi>Happy Deliverance,</hi> at <hi>Berd Iſland,</hi> they were two and twenty in number, and had on board two buts and four hogſheads of water, two of the hogs that had come on ſhore from the ſhip alive, one firkin of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0090500800:22"/>
butter, about 90 ponnd of biſcuit, and about ten ten days ſalt proviſions, at two ounces a man per day, but this was quite rotten and decayed.</p>
            <p>The joy which they felt at putting off from this dreadful ſeat of ſamine and deſolation was too great to be expreſſed; but it was of very ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, for as ſoon as they got to the mouth of the little channel which led to the rock, the grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nails came home, and they were inſtantly driven on the rocks where their boat, which had coſt ſeven months inceſſant labour, and was the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all their hopes, ſtruck ſo often and with ſuch violence, that they were thrown into the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſternation, and expected every moment ſhe would be broken to pieces. It was a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their diſtreſs, that no efforts of their own could at all contribute to extricate or relive them, ſo that they could only gaze at each other, and wait, helpleſs and inactive, for the moment of Deſtruction. In this condition, however, it pleaſed him whom the winds and waves obey, to relieve them; a ſwell of the ſea took the boat ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, that it lifted her from the rock on which ſhe was beating, and carrying over her the bar, left her in four fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m calm water. Here they immedately anchored, to repair their damage by ſecuring the grapnails, and this was not effectually done till noon the next day.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of February, at about one in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0090500800:23"/>
afternoon, they weighed and ſtood to the eaſtward, in order to make the river St. Lucia, on the coaſt of Africa, about 300 leagues to the north-eaſt of the Cape, their firſt port. In this attempt they perſiſted till the ſecond of March, being no leſs than twelve days and nights, without getting one mile on their courſe; for the currents, by which their ſhip had been driven out of her way, and which not being allowed for, had produced a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal error in their reckoning, now run ſo ſtrong to the weſtward, that a fair wind, inſtead of carrying them forward, ſcarce enabled them to keep their ground. In the mean time, their proviſions was very near exhauſted, and being at once expoſed both to ſhipwreck and famine, they determined to deliver themſelves up to the courſe of the current, which they had endeavoured in vain to ſtem, and ſo get back to the Cape.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of March, therefore, they bore away to the weſtward, but the very next day the wind, which, till then had been eaſterly, blew a ſtrong gale from the weſt, ſo that the wind now counteracted the force of the current, and continuing to riſe all that day and the following night, the next morning, Thurſday, March 4, it it blew a ſtrom. They now endeavoured to lie too, but they ſhipped ſuch heavy ſeas, that they were in perpetual danger of being daſhed to pieces, and were therefore compelled to ſend away under
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0090500800:24"/>
their topſail only. They were thus driven before the tempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, at a great rate, till the next morning about three o'clock, and then the weather became fine.</p>
            <p>This courſe they continued till Wedneſday, March the 10th, when the wind ſhifting to the eaſtward, they anchored in twelve fathom water, at the diſtance of about half a mile from the ſhore. In the evening many of the natives came down to the water-ſide, hallowing and making ſigns that they ſhould land, which they many times attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but found it impracticable. In the morning the natives appeared again, repeating their ſignals, and driving down great numbers of cattle, but the poor wretches on board were ſtill tantalized by the ſight of plenty, which they could not reach, for no place to land could yet be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>—On Monday the 15th of March, they determined, at all events, to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to get the ſloop into river; having waited therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>The natives had now come again to the ſhore, and the people on board got together ſome braſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of all kinds were procured in great plenty at the ſame rate, particularly milk, and a ſmall grain that reſembled Guinea wheat. This grain they attempted to bake into into biſcuit for ſea ſtores, but could not ſucceed; however they found an excellent expedient, by boiling it wich their meat, which anſwered the ſame purpoſe as bread, and made very good food.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They continued on ſhore at this place near a fortnight, and found the natives an honeſt, open, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0090500800:26"/>
pleaſure which no ſelfiſh gratification can produce. Their manner of living and appearance were the ſame that have been ſo often deſcribed by thoſe who have accounts of the people called Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots, who inhabit the Cape of Good Hope, except that as theſe had not been uſed to any commerce with Europeans, they were more innocent, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, and ſincere. It is, however, remarkable, that among theſe people, who are all black, and woolly haired, there was a youth of about 12 or 14 years, who was quite white, and had regular European features, with fine light hair. The people of the ſloop obſerved, that he was treated as a ſervant, being ſent on errands, and ſometimes not permitted to eat till the reſt had done. They alſo took notice, that he diſappeared a few days before they left the coaſt, and therefore they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the natives were afraid they ſhould carry him off with them, nor was one of the natives themſelves to be ſeen the morning they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On Monday, March</hi> 29, <hi>having laid in great plenty of proviſions, they got ſafe over the bar, and made ſail for the river St. Lucia, where they arrived on Tueſday the 6th of April, having found the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent more favourable than before, and no other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence having happened that was worth relating.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having got into the river, and anchored in three
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0090500800:27"/>
fathom water, they went on ſhore, but they found the people very different from thoſe with whom they laſt traded. When the braſs buttons and bits of old iron were offered them, they refuſed them, and taking up ſome of the ſand from the beach, they poured it out of one hand into the other, by which they might perhaps intend to intimate, that they wanted ſtrong lipuors, tho' the ſloop's people did not underſtand it; and, if they had, thep had no ſtrong liquors for them. They made ſigns alſo, that they wanted ſome braſs rings, big enough to ſerve as collars; but in this too their viſitants were equally unable to gratify them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Among other things, howiver, which they offered to barter, was a braſs handle of a cheſt, and a peice of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>The natives of this part of the coaſt, by their frepuent dealings with Europeans, had learned to be cleanly in their perſons and food, dreſſing their hair up very neatly, and laying aſide the greaſe and garbage, with which the others anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adorned themſelves; but at the ſame time they had learnt to be proud, crafty, deceitful,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0090500800:28"/>
and diſhoneſt. However, the adventures ſtayed with them till Sunday the 18th of April, and then getting all on board, they weighed and made ſail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hitherto they had been united by adverſity in the bond of friendſhip; but as they had now a near proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hect of deliverance, their minds were leſs tender, and their different peculiarities of temper and opinion were indulged with leſs reſtraint. As they were ſailing down the river, a diſpute aroſe about the time and manner of croſſing the bar, which was then very near, and it was carried ſo high, that ſome of them hawled down the ſails, and lel go the grapnail cloſe to the brake of a ſand; nine of them then hoiſted out the little boat, and went on ſhore, ſwearing that they would ſooner take their chance of getting to De la Goa by land, than be drowned in attempting to get over the bar. Thoſe who remained in the ſloop were by this accident reduced to very great diſtreſs; for being prevented by the delay they had ſuffered, from getting over the bar at high water, and the wind and tide both ſetting out of the river at a great rate, they were very ſoon forced on the breakers, where there was then but</hi> 8 <hi>foot of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the veſſel drawing 5, ſhe muſt inevitably have been grounded and beaten to pieces, before the river was half empty.</hi>

than half an hour the ſurface of the water became ſmooth, and, by the vigorous efforts of thoſe on board, the veſſel was brought ſafely out of the river.</p>

            <p>Here they found the Roſe galley, Captain Chandler, trading for beef and ivory, and moſt of them begged a paſſage with him to Bombay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After they had contunied here about three weeks three of the nine men who had deſerted them at St. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, were brought up the river in a ſmall boat of the country, and reported, that the other ſix were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without any covering but a ſhirt and of drawers, onthe other ſide of the bay of Delagoa, waiting for a boat to bring them over.</hi>
            </p>

common proprity. The officers who had ſecured the remainder for the company, and who, till now, had no means of recovering the reſt, told Capt. Chandler what had happened, and having conſulted with him what to do, they enticed four or five of thoſe who were on board the ſloop, on ſhore, and two others on board the Roſe galley: they then took Captain Chandler's pinnace, well manned and armed, and went on board their ſloop, where they ſecured all the money, plate, and packets they could find, without oſſerin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
