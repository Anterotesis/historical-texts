            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS Health is the nobleſt bleſſing of this life, the method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it ſhould be our principal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. While poſſeſſed of it, we ſeldom pay a proper attention to its importance; when loſt, we become ſenſible of its value, but are frequently careleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its recovery. The reaſons are plain; while we have it we trifle with it till it flies us; when fled, we trifle with our misfortune, becauſe we ſuppoſe the recovery to be either impoſſible or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.</p>
            <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0490100900:4"/>
            <p>For the benefit of mankind, we here furniſh the public with ſome of the beſt and eaſieſt methods of recovering and ſecuring health, and of preſerving life, which comprehend the greateſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in the Medical Art. Theſe will equally ſuit all ranks of people; the <hi>Poor,</hi> becauſe the Remedies may be <hi>cheaply</hi> obtained; and the <hi>Rich,</hi> becauſe they may be <hi>eaſily</hi> put in practice. Hence <hi>Health</hi> may be recovered with <hi>Facility,</hi> and a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the powers of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine obtained without <hi>Difficulty.</hi> So that our readers may at once ceaſe to be <hi>Patients</hi> themſelves, or, if they pleaſe, become <hi>Practical Phyſicians</hi> to others.</p>

                  <head>SCURVY.</head>
                  <p>THE Scurvy being the principal diſeaſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the inhabitants of Great Britain, and the ſource from whence many of their other diſorders flow, we thought it neceſſary to commence this ſalutary Work, with an account of the nature of, and the remedies againſt, this fatal foe to ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONS.</p>

               <div type="symptoms">
                  <head>SYMPTOMS.</head>
                  <p>THE ſymptoms or ſigns of this dangerous diſeaſe are a frequent lazineſs and lowneſs of ſpirits, pains in various parts of the body, ſometimes livid ſpots, often a ſallow complexion, a continual itching of the blood, difficulty of breathing, ſwelling of the legs, bleeding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0490100900:6"/>at the noſe, and ſpongy gums, ſubject to pains and bleedings. But it is to be obſerved, that as conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions differ, the ſigns or ſymptoms of the diſeaſe vary; and people, according to their years, ſituations in life, and manner of living, are attacked by this diſeaſe, under ſeveral appearances; but ſome of the above ſymptoms always attend it according to the conſtitution of thoſe afflicted; for whoſe benefit we ſhall point out the moſt approved and certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of cure hitherto diſcovered.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="cure">
                  <head>REMEDIES.</head>
                  <p>A Milk diet, with weak whey, greens of all kinds, freſh vegetables, fruits, acids, ſcurvy-graſs ale, freſh beer and cyder, tar water taken twice a day, with camphire, one ſcruple, aethiops mineral, half an ounce, powder of gum-guaiacum, two drachms, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, one ounce, mix and make an electuary, and take the bigneſs of a nutmeg every night going to reſt. The patient may likewiſe drink the decoction of the woods. Drinking ſea-water will be found extremely beneficial, as will bathing in the ſea.</p>
                  <p>But for the eaſieſt and moſt efficacious remedy for this dreadful diſeaſe, we may thank Capt. Cook, who in his late voyage round the world, by the command of his preſent MAJESTY in the ſhip <hi>Reſolution,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf and all his men from the Scurvy, by the uſe of a very ſimple medicine; though he paſſed through the temperature, the frigid and the torrid zones, was abſent from England three years and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, and went through ſuch a variety of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, as were ſufficient to make the ſevereſt attacks on the moſt robuſt conſtitution. But as his methods of proceeding will appear with moſt propriety in his own words, we ſhall preſent our readers with his Letter to Sir <hi>John Pringle,</hi> Bart, Preſident of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> which letter is dated <hi>March</hi> 5, 1776;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0490100900:7"/>and for which Captain Cook received a Premium Medal.</p>

                        <opener>
                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>"AS many gentlemen have expreſſed ſome ſurprize at the uncommon good ſtate of health which the crew of the <hi>Reſolution,</hi> under my command, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced during her late voyage; I take the liberty to communicate to you the methods that were taken to obtain that end. Much was owing to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary attention given by the Admiralty, in cauſing ſuch articles to be put on board, as either by experience or conjecture were judged to tend moſt to preſerve the health of ſeamen. I ſhall not treſpaſs upon your time in mentioning all thoſe articles, but confine myſelf to ſuch as were found the moſt uſeful.</p>
                        <p>"We had on board a large quantity of malt, of which was made ſweet-wort, and given (not only to thoſe men who had manifeſt ſymptoms of the ſcurvy, but to ſuch alſo as were, from circumſtances, judged to be moſt liable to that diſorder) from one to two or three pints in the day to each man, or in ſuch proportion as the ſurgeon thought neceſſary; which ſometimes amounted to three quarts in the twenty-four hours. This is without doubt one of the beſt antiſcorbutic ſea-medicines yet found out; and if given in time will, with proper attention to other things, I am perſuaded, prevent the ſcurvy from making any great progreſs for a conſiderable time: but I am not altogether of opinion, that it will cure it in an advanced ſtate at ſea.</p>
                        <p>"Sour-krout, of which we had alſo a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, is not only a wholeſome vegetable food, but, in my judgment, highly antiſcorbutic, and ſpoils not by keeping. A pound of it was ſerved to each
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0490100900:8"/>man, when at ſea, twice a week, or oftener when it was thought neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>"Portable ſoup, or broth, was another eſſential article, of which we had likewiſe a liberal ſupply. An ounce of this to each man, or ſuch other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as was thought neceſſary, was boiled with their peas three days in the week; and when we were in places where freſh vegetables could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, it was boiled, with them and with wheat or oatmeal, every morning for breakfaſt, and alſo with dried peas and freſh vegetables for dinner. It enabled us to make ſeveral nouriſhing and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meſſes, and was the means of making the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eat a greater quantity of greens than they would have done otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>"Further, we were provided with rob of lemons and oranges; which the ſurgeon found uſeful in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes.</p>
                        <p>"Amongſt other articles of victualling, we were furniſhed with ſugar in the room of oil, and with wheat inſtead of much oatmeal, and were certainly gainers by the exchange. Sugar, I imagine, is a very good antiſcorbutic; whereas oil, ſuch at leaſt as is uſually given to the navy, I apprehend has the contrary effect. But the introduction of the moſt ſalutary articles, either as proviſion or medicines will generally prove unſucceſsful, unleſs ſupported by certain rules of living.</p>
                        <p>"On this principle, many years experience, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome hints I had from Sir Hugh Palliſer, the Captains Campbell, Wallis, and other intelligent officers, enabled me to lay down a plan whereby all was to be conducted. The crew were at three watches, except upon ſome extraordinary occaſions. By this means they were not ſo much expoſed to the weather as if they had been at watch and watch; and they had generally dry cloaths to ſhift themſelves when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0490100900:9"/>they happened to get wet. Care was alſo taken to expoſe them as little as poſſible. Proper methods were employed to keep their perſons, hammocks, bedding, cloaths, &amp;c. conſtantly clean and dry. Equal pains were taken to keep the ſhip clean and dry between decks. Once or twice a week ſhe was aired with fires; and when this could not be done, ſhe was ſmoaked with gunpowder moiſtened with vinegar or water. I had alſo frequently a fire made in an iron pot at the bottom of the well, which greatly purified the air in the lower parts of the ſhip. To this and cleanlineſs, as well in the ſhip as amongſt the people, too great attention cannot be paid; the leaſt neglect occaſions a putrid offenſive ſmell below, which nothing but fires will remove; and if theſe be not uſed in time, thoſe ſmells will be attended with bad conſequences. Proper care was taken of the ſhip's coppers, ſo that they were kept conſtantly clean. The fat, which boiled out of the ſalt beef and pork, I never ſuffered to be given to the people, as is cuſtomary; being of opinion that it promotes the ſcurvy. I never failed to take in water wherever it was to be procured, even when we did not ſeem to want it; becauſe I look upon freſh water from the ſhore to be much more wholeſome than that which has been kept for ſome time on board. Of this eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial article we were never at an allowance, but had always abundance for every neceſſary purpoſe. I am convinced that with plenty of freſh water, and a cloſe attention to cleanlineſs, a ſhip's company will ſeldom be much afflicted with the ſcurvy, though they ſhould not be provided with any of the antiſcorbutics before-mentioned. We came to few places where either the art of man or nature did not afford ſome ſort of refreſhment or other, either of the animal or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table kind. It was my firſt care to procure what could be met with of either, by every means in my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0490100900:10"/>power, and to oblige our people to make uſe thereof, both by my example and authority; but the benefits ariſing from ſuch refreſhments ſoon became ſo obvious, that I had little occaſion to employ either the one or the other.</p>

                        <q>"I entirely agree with you, that the dearneſs of the rob of lemons and oranges will hinder them from being furniſhed in large quantities, but I do not think this ſo neceſſary; for though they may aſſiſt other things, I have no great opinion of them alone. Nor have I an higher opinion of vinegar: my people had it very ſparingly during the late voyage; and towards the latter part, none at all; and yet we experienced no ill effects from the want of it. The cuſtom of waſhing the inſide of the ſhip with vinegar I ſeldom obſerved, thinking, that fire and ſmoak anſwered the purpoſe much better."</q>

                  <p>To the above we ſhall ſubjoin the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on Captain Cook's judicious procedure; with ſome other intereſting particulars; being a ſummary of the diſcovery of the great antiſcorbutic virtues of ſweet-wort by Dr. Macbride, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>"CAPTAIN COOK begins his lift of ſtores with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0490100900:11"/>
                        <hi>malt:</hi> "Of this," he ſays, "was made ſweet-wort, and given not only to thoſe men who had manifeſt ſymptoms of the ſcurvy, but to ſuch alſo as were judged to be the moſt liable to it."</q> Dr. Macbride, who firſt ſuggeſted this preparation, was led, as he ſays, to the diſcovery by ſome experiments that had been laid before the Royal Society; by which it appeared, that the air produced by alimentary fermentation was endowed with a power of correcting putrefaction. The fact he confirmed by numerous trials, and finding this fluid to be <hi>fixed air,</hi> he juſtly concluded, that whatever ſubſtance proper for food abounded with it, and which could be conveniently carried to ſea, would make one of the beſt proviſions againſt the ſcurvy; which he then conſidered as a putrid diſeaſe, and as ſuch to be prevented or cured by that powerful kind of antiſeptic. Beer, for inſtance, hath always been eſteemed one of the beſt antiſcorbutics; but as that derived all its <hi>fixed air</hi> from the malt of which it is made, he inferred, that malt itſelf was preferable in long voyages, as it took up leſs room than the brewed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and would keep longer ſound. Experience hath ſince verified this ingenious theory, and the malt hath now gained to much credit in the navy, that there only wanted ſo long, ſo healthful, and ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a voyage as this, to rank it among the moſt indiſpenſable articles of proviſion. For though Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook remarks, that <q>"a proper attention to other things muſt be joined, and that he is not altogether of opinion, that the wort will be able to cure the ſcurvy in an advanced ſtate at ſea; yet he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that it is ſufficient to prevent that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from making any great progreſs, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time;"</q> and therefore he doth not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to pronounce it, <q>"one of the beſt antiſcorbutic medicines yet found out."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſalutary <hi>gas,</hi> or <hi>fixed air,</hi> is contained more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0490100900:12"/>or leſs in all fermentable liquors, and begins to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe putrefaction as ſoon as the working or inteſtine motion commences.</p>
                  <p>In wine it abounds, and perhaps no vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is more replete with it than the fruit of the vine. If we join the grateful taſte of wine, we muſt rank it firſt in the liſt of antiſcorbutic liquors. Cyder is likewiſe good, with other vinous produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from fruit, as alſo the various kinds of beer. It hath been a conſtant obſervation, that in long cruizes or diſtant voyages, the ſcurvy is never ſeen whilſt the ſmall-beer holds out at a full allowance; but that when it is all expended, the diſorder ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. It were therefore to be wiſhed, that this moſt wholeſome beverage could be renewed at ſea; but our ſhips afford not ſufficient convenience. The Ruſſians however make a ſhift to prepare at ſea, as well as at land, a liquor of a middle quality between wort and ſmall-beer, in the following manner. They take ground malt and rye meal in a certain proportion, which they knead into ſmall loaves, and bake in the oven. Theſe they occaſionally infuſe in a proper quantity of warm water, which begins ſo ſoon to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in the ſpace of twenty-four hours their brewage is compleated, in the production of a ſmall, briſk, and acidulous liquor, which they call <hi>quas,</hi> palatable to themſelves, and not diſagreeable to the taſte of ſtrangers. The late Dr. Mounſey, member of the Royal Society, who had lived long in Ruſſia, and had been <hi>Archiater</hi> under two ſucceſſive ſovereigns, ſays, that the <hi>quas</hi> was the common and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome drink both of the fleets and armies of that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and that it was particularly good againſt the ſcurvy. He added, that happening to be at Moſcow when he peruſed the "Obſervations on the Jail-Fever," publiſhed here, he had been induced to compare what he read in that treatiſe with what he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0490100900:13"/>ſhould ſee in the ſeveral priſons of that large city: but to his ſurprize, after viſiting them all, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them full of malefactors, for the late empreſs then ſuffered none of thoſe who were convicted of capital crimes to be put to death, yet he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover no fever among them, nor learn that any acute diſtemper peculiar to jails had ever been known there. He obſerved that ſome of thoſe places of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had a yard, into which the priſoners were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to come for the air; but that there were others without this advantage, yet not ſickly: ſo that he could aſſign no other reaſon for the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition of thoſe men than the kind of diet they uſed; which was the ſame with that of the common people of the country, who not being able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe fleſh-meat live moſtly on rye-bread, (the moſt aceſcent of any bread) and drink <hi>quas.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with ſaying, that upon his return to Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, he had made the ſame enquiry there, and with the ſame reſult.</p>
                  <p>Thus far my informer: from whoſe account it would appear, that the rye-meal aſſiſted both in quickening the fermentation, and adding more fixed air; ſince the malt alone could not ſo readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo acidulous and briſk a liquor. And there is little doubt, but that whenever the other grains can be brought to a proper degree of fermentation, they will more or leſs in the ſame way become uſeful. That oats will, I am ſatisfied, from what I have been told by one of the intelligent friends of Captain Cook. This gentleman being on a cruize in a large ſhip, in the beginning of the late war, and the ſcurvy breaking out among his crew, he bethought himſelf of a kind of food, he had ſeen uſed in ſome parts of the country, as the moſt proper on this occaſion. Some oatmeal is put into a wooden veſſel, hot water is poured upon it, and the infuſion continues until
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0490100900:14"/>the liquor begins to taſte ſouriſh; that is, till a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation comes on, which in a place moderately warm may be in the ſpace of two days. The water is then poured off from the grounds, and boiled down to the conſiſtence of a jelly. This he ordered to be made, and dealt out in meſſes, being firſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with ſugar, and ſeaſoned with ſome prize-wine he had taken, which, though turned ſour, yet improved the taſte, and made this aliment no leſs palatable than medicinal.</p>

                     <p>THE urine of the perſon afflicted is high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, and has a ſandy ſediment of a reddiſh caſt; the part affected looks red and is ſwelled. The pain is exceedingly acute, as if the bone was broken and, is ſucceeded by a ſlight fever, and a chilneſs or ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſeizes the great toe, ancle, heel, calf of the leg, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>BEFORE the afflicted go to bed at night, they ſhould take a tea ſpoonful of volatile tincture of guaiacum in a glaſs of water: keep themſelves warm, and drink ſack whey. Exerciſe is very requiſite for thoſe afflicted with this diſorder.</p>
                     <p>As the duke of Portland's Gout Powder is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably efficacious in the cure of this diſorder, we ſhall here tranſcribe the receipt for making it.</p>
                     <p>TAKE of round birthwort root and gentian root, of the tops and leaves of germander, ground pine, and centaury: take of all theſe, well dried, powdered and ſifted as fine as poſſible, an equal quantity; mix them well together, and take one drachm of this mixed powder every morning faſting in a cup of wine and water, broth, tea, or any other vehicle you like beſt;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0490100900:15"/>keep faſting an hour and an half after it. Continue this medicine for three months without interruption, then diminiſh the doſe to three quarters of a drachm for three months longer, then to half a drachm for ſix months more, taking it regularly every morning if poſſible. After the firſt year, it will be ſufficient to take half a drachm every other day. As this medicine operates inſenſibly, it will take, perhaps, two years before you receive any great benefit; ſo you muſt not be diſcouraged, though you do not perceive at firſt any great amendment; it works ſlow but ſure: it doth not confine the patient to any particular diet, if he lives ſoberly, and abſtains from thoſe meats and liquors that have always been accounted pernicious in the gout; as champaign, drams, high ſauces, &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>SYMPTOMS.</head>
                     <p>THERE are two principal ſources of fevers, one comprehends the cauſes which render the blood and other fluids of the body too thick; the other includes thoſe which make them too thin. Let us now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how one ſort may be diſtinguiſhed from the other.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould be obſerved, that in all fevers of every kind, there is a morbid or malignant quality intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and ſubſiſting in the blood as the productive cauſe; and the proper means for curing them are ſuch methods and medicines as by experience have been found effectual for removing their morbid qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and recovering the ſick in the ſhorteſt time.</p>
                     <p>In ſome perſons, when there is too much blood, ſuch bleeding may be adviſed as will draw off the exceſs, except in peſtilential diſtempers, in which blood-letting has proved almoſt always mortal, even in the bodies fulleſt of blood; this evacuation muſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0490100900:17"/>be moderately uſed in pleuriſies, as the extremity of pain and difficulty of breathing ſhall acquire it.</p>
                     <p>That the common people (who generally know when perſons have fevers) may have a little more knowledge of theſe acute diſeaſes, and how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh one kind of them from the other; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is to direct for the ſick, ſhould carefully enquire into the ſtate of his body; he ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his pulſe. Let him feel the pulſe of two or three that are in health, and his own pulſe; and then compare them with the pulſe of the patient, and thereby he will come nearly to know how much it differs from the healthful ſtandard, as to quickneſs or ſlowneſs, and as to its ſtrength and weakneſs, and be able to deduce ſome concluſions which may guide his conduct; then let him learn the degree of febrile heat; and one way to do this may be by feeling the ſide of the neck below the ears (through which the large blood veſſels paſs to and from the brain) and thus the degree of the heat of the blood may be known; and the other ſymptoms of the patient ſhould be particularly enquired into.</p>
                     <p>If the heat of the body be exceſſive, the pulſe quick and ſtrong, the fleſh very dry, the pores of the ſkin very cloſe, and the thirſt very great, it may be concluded that the cauſe which produced that fever has rendered the blood too thick.</p>
                     <p>If the pulſe is too quick, and not ſtrong, and the heat of the body not great; if the tongue is very black or dry, and the thirſt is great, or it the patient voids blood by urine, or ſpitting, or at his noſe, or by ſtool; or if he has flat ſpots on his ſkin, black or reddiſh in colour, or if he has a great looſeneſs, with watery or thin ſtools; or if he has profuſe ſweats, with a ſenſible ſinking of his ſpirits, and decreaſe of ſtrength, it may be inſerted, that the fever is of a putrid kind.</p>

                     <head>REMEDIES.</head>
                     <p>THE following general rules ſhould be obſerved: to drink as plentifully as poſſible ſome diluting liquor whenever thirſty, ſuch as barley-water, mint and balm and ſage tea, thin water-gruel, or beef tea made as follows:</p>
                     <p>Take a pound of lean beef, out it ſmall, pour upon it two quarts of water, boil it for the ſpace of five minutes, then keep for uſe.</p>
                     <p>To uſe ſuch nutritious food, as moſt freely may be taken, becauſe it abates the acrimony of the blood, repairs the waſte of the body, and is one of the beſt cordials; ſmall whey made with Canary or Mountain wine may be frequently uſed.</p>
                     <p>It may be neceſſary, before we proceed farther, to premiſe that in liquid, by four table ſpoonfuls, is meant half a gill, or two ounces; two ſpoonfuls one ounce, one ſpoonful half an ounce, or four drachms.</p>
                     <p>If ſeized with any feveriſh complaint, take the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing mixture.</p>
                     <p>Salt of wormwood, two drachms, lemon juice, or any acid, a ſufficient quantity to make a neutral me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, ſugar about two drachms, common water about half a pint, and about two ounces of nutmeg water, or any ſpirit; mix together, and take two ſpoonfuls every three hours.</p>
                     <p>At night take a little ſweat going to reſt, and the next morning continue the mixture. Or if incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to make up the above medicine, or too poor to get it, we recommend Salt Petre as an efficacious as well as cheap remedy.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall mention one inſtance of its utility. A poor woman aſked advice for her huſband (a man about forty years of age) who had a fever, with a violent pain in his ſide, and was light-headed at times.</p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0490100900:19"/>
                     <p>We adviſed her to get an ounce of ſalt-petre, and powder it; then to divide it into four equal parts, and each of them into four others for ſo many doſes, each of which will contain about half a drachm, directing that ſhe ſhould give one of them, diſſolved in a coffee diſh of ſage tea, ſweetened with ſugar to his palate every three or four hours; and when he had taken this ſalt, ſhe came and ſaid, that his fever was gone; but that his cough remained. We then adviſed her to give him about twenty drops of balſam capivi, with powder ſugar, night and morning; and he happily recovered.</p>
                     <p>But if troubled with a cough, add, of ſperma-ceti in powder two drachms; diſſolved with the yolk of an egg, to be taken in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>Or, if that cannot be had, the following powder.</p>
                     <p>Take ſperma-ceti in powder, half an ounce; ſugar and ſalt-petre each two drachms; mixt together, and take as much as will lay on a ſhilling every three or four hours in any liquid.</p>
                     <p>If bound, take the following opening mixture.</p>
                     <p>Take two drachms of ſenna leaves, boil in ten ounces of common water to eight ounces; ſtrain off, and add manna half an ounce, tincture of ſenna one ounce; mix, and take two table ſpoonfuls every three hours, till it operates.</p>
                     <p>This medicine is eaſily prepared, and very handy on many occaſions, eſpecially when the body calls for a remedy of this nature; it is cooling as well as lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative; waſhes its paſſage through the bowels, without any griping or diſorder, and ſtands in need at the ſame time of no over ſtrict regimen.</p>
                     <p>Thus far fevers in general; proceed we therefore to thoſe more particular.</p>

                        <p>THE young, robuſt plethoric habit, will ever be moſt liable to inflammations; whilſt, on, the contrary,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0490100900:20"/>in the weakly and infirm, the circulation cannot readily be worked up to ſuch a pitch as is requiſite to conſtitute a diſeaſe of an inflammatory kind; in both, cold or obſtructed perſpiration is almoſt the only occaſional cauſe. This fever may be eaſily known from the conſtitution of the ſick perſon; a quick, full and tenſe pulſe, hard beyond its natural ſtate; florid countenance, with great heat and thirſt, acute pains in the head, back and loins, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>To the cure of an inflammatory fever therefore it is neceſſary, firſt, to take away about ſix or eight ounces of blood, then give about fifteen grains of Ipecacuanha in a cup of any liquid, and work it off with camomile flower tea, having nothing after it that night, but a little mulled wine to ſettle the ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>Tartar emetic two grains, diaphoretic antimony, ten grains, barley water, eight ounces; mix and take two ſpoonfuls every four hours; and every now and then about as much ſalt-petre as will lay on a ſhilling diſſolved in the drink.</p>
                        <p>If all this ſhould not open the body, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to add an emollient clyſter.</p>
                        <p>If at the end of the diſeaſe the pulſe ſhould flag, diſcontinue the medicines, and uſe cordials.</p>
                        <p>If an intermiſſion ſhould happen, with gentle ſweats, and turbid urine; the bark in ſmall doſes or rather a decoction of it, may be thrown in.</p>

                        <p>In the one it becomes neceſſary to lower the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus of the circulation, by evacuations and coolers; in the other, the warm cordial, the ſtimulating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are by all means adviſeable to excite the vis vitae, and promote ſuch a degree of fever as may ſuffice for its expulſion.</p>
                        <p>Evacuations of blood, and by ſtool, can then be, of no ſervice in the cure of a low fever, but a great detriment. A gentle vomit in the beginning, and a breathing ſweat throughout its continuance will be uſeful.</p>
                        <p>A warm, light, nouriſhing diet, and plenty of generous wine will be expedient, with bliſters and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napiſms, or muſtard plaiſters and other drawers of the feet, for the relief of the ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then give the ipecacuanha vomit, with the mulled wine as before deſcribed; and going to bed, half a drachm of mithridate. The next day the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing mixture.</p>
                        <p>Take Venice treatle, two drachms, ſyrup of ſaffron, half an ounce, ſimple mint water, eight ounces, ſtrong cinnamon water, two ounces, volatile tincture of valerian, two drachms, mix, and take two ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls every three or four hours.</p>
                        <p>To theſe may be added, as occaſion requires, a little opiate camphire, contrayerva, valerian, cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal, warm aromatics, and ſome volatile ſalts; and when better, the gum pills; but if towards the latter end of the diſeaſe, when gentle ſweats break out, and the urine becomes turbid or thick, the bark will be attended with great advantage, though there ſhould appear no intermiſſion.</p>

                     <p>TO cure an intermiſſion, the following is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable.—Beſt bark, one ounce, finely bruised; ſnake root, two drachms, finely bruiſed; boil in common water from a pint and a half to one pint, ſtrain it off, and take four ſpoonfuls every three or four hours. If it ſhould purge, add to each doſe five or ſix drops of liquid laudanum; if it ſhould bind, about five or ſix grains of powdered rhubarb; if want of appetite, about five or ſix drops of elixir of vitriol.</p>
                     <p>A variety of different medicines have been found to ſucceed, but the preference has ever been given to the bark; twelve drachms of which generally puts by the fit, though it is neceſſary to continue a few doſes more to prevent a return.</p>

                     <p>Intermitting Fevers, thoſe eſpecially whoſe fits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn every other day, have been often cured with a few doſes of cochineal, by taking about half a drachm of it in powder, ſome time before the acceſſion of each fit; and others have been recovered, by taking five, ſix, or ſeven grains of the Virginian ſnake root, three times on the days of intermiſſion, at about four or five hours diſtance; and I have with ſucceſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſome of the poor to drink a quarter of a pint of tea, made with the root of burdock, every third or fourth hour, during the intermiſſions, ſweetened with ſugar, or not ſweetened, as the patient chuſes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſort of intermittents allow a good opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for taking the Peruvian bark, and that the poor, thoſe great objects of our compaſſion and charity, may have the benefit of that excellent remedy, at the leaſt expence, adviſe the following method, viz.</p>

                     <p>If the patient can take a drachm of the bark for a doſe, without finding his ſtomach loaded, let that quantity be the doſe; and when he has taken one

                     <p>The ſymptoms, which are obvious, and neceſſary conſequences of an ulcerated ſtate of the lungs, are a cough, a copious ſpitting of a purulent-like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is thrown up night and morning, and if tried, ſinks in water.</p>
                     <p>Oppreſſion of the breaſt, bad appetite, thirſt great, hectic fever, colliquative ſweats, which ſucceed night and morning alternately, a lowneſs, and great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of urine, the pulſe becomes quick and ſharp, the body pines, and is emaciated, and its ſeveral functions totally impaired and decayed.</p>

                     <p>THE air where the patient lies ought to be free and pure, the conſtitution muſt be kept in action, and take as much exerciſe every day as it can bear.</p>
                     <p>Horſe-riding, giving the body motion with little fatigue, if convenient, is preferable to any carriage, which ſhould be before dinner, elſe it proves hurtful. Great care muſt be taken to prevent catching cold by damp things or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>A ſouthern voyage by ſea frequently cures, when all things elſe fail, provided the proviſions are freſh; and as milk cannot there be eaſily obtained, fruits, broths and balſamics muſt ſupply the place.</p>
                     <p>A proper regimen, with the patient's own endeavours,

                     <p>Firſt, I would recommend for diet, light, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative, and diluting drink. Milk, aſſes milk, (if obtainable) water-gruel made of meal, or fine white flour, with a little butter or ſugar, or cyder whey, or barley water, or ground-ivy tea ſweetened with ſugar or honey, acidulated with the juice of lemon, or an apple boiled in a pint of water, with one large ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of brandy, and ſweetened as before directed, as neceſſary to promote the ſpitting up the phlegm.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to remove the fever, give the following medicine:</p>
                     <p>Salt-petre, two drachms; cochineal, half a drachm; pure water, half a pint; ſyrup of balſam, or ſugar, or honey, ſufficient to pallate; brandy, or rather rum, two ounces; mix theſe and take two ſpoonfuls every third or fourth hour.</p>
                     <p>If there ſhould be a flux, then the following:</p>
                     <p>Tincture of roſes, one pint; liquid laudanum, twenty grains; drink a cupful often.</p>

For common drink milk and water, or a decoction of marſhmallow roots, parſley and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice may be uſed; but if the perſon has been uſed to ſtrong liquors, ſmall punch, made without acid, may be drank ſparingly.

                     <p>The patient ought to drink no more of any liquor than is ſufficient to quench his thirſt, and he ſhould hold his water as long as he can without great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, that it may have the longer time to act in the ſtone.</p>

Or take the large leaves that grow upon the ſtem of the artichoak, wipe (not waſh) them; bruiſe them in a mortar, and ſtrain out the juice through a linen cloth, forcing it out; then put a pint of the juice into a quart bottle, with a pint of Madeira wine, or Mountain, if you cannot get good Madeira.

However, when the humour becomes more active, the ſwelling ſuddenly grows large, livid, round, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, painful, then breaks, and ſharp ſtinking ſores ſucceed, which eat away the ſound parts, when the lips of the wound become exceeding diſguſtful to the ſight. This diſorder generally affecs the breaſts, but ſometimes attacks the privities, ears, noſe, and arm-pits.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. In removing the body to a convenient place, great care muſt be taken that it be not bruiſed, nor ſhaken violently, nor roughly handled, nor carried over any one's ſhoulders with the head hanging down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, nor rolled upon the ground, or over a barrel, nor lifted up by the heels, except with the greateſt caution. For experience proves, that all theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods are injurious, and often deſtroy the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of life. The unfortunate object ſhould be cautiouſly conveyed by two or more perſons, or in a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0490100900:52"/>carriage upon ſtraw, lying as on a bed with the head a little raiſed, and kept in as natural and eaſy a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The body being well dried with a cloth, ſhould be placed in a moderate degree of heat, but not too near a large fire. The windows or door of the room ſhould be left open, and no more perſons be admitted into it than thoſe who are abſolutely neceſſary, as the life of the patient greatly depends upon their having the benefit of a pure air. The warmth moſt promiſing of ſucceſs is that of a bed or blanket, properly warmed. Bottles of hot water ſhould be laid at the bottoms of the feet, in the joints of the knees, and under the arm-pits; and a warming-pan, moderately heated, or hot bricks, wrapped in cloths, ſhould be rubbed over the body, and particularly along the back. The natural and kindly warmth of a healthy perſon lying by the ſide of the body, has been found in many caſes very efficacious. The ſhirt or cloaths of an attendant, or the ſkin of a ſheep freſh killed, may alſo be uſed with advantage. Should theſe accidents happen in the neighbourhood of a warm bath, brew-houſe, baker, glaſs-houſe, ſaltern, ſoap-boiler, or any fabric where warm lees, aſhes, embers, grains, ſand, water, &amp;c. are eaſily procured, it would be of the utmoſt ſervice to place the body in any of theſe, moderated to a degree of heat, but very little exceeding that of a healthy perſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The ſubject being placed in one or other of theſe advantageous circumſtances, as ſpeedily as poſſible, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtimulating methods ſhould next be employed. The moſt efficacious are, to blow with force into the lungs, by applying the mouth to that part of the patient, cloſing his noſtrils with one hand, and gently expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the air again by preſſing the cheſt with the other, imitating the ſtrong breathing of a healthy perſon: the medium of a handkerchief or cloth may be uſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0490100900:53"/>to render the operation leſs indelicate. Whilſt one aſſiſtant is conſtantly employed in this operation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhould throw the ſmoak of tobacco up by the fundament into the bowels, by means of a pipe or fumigator, ſuch as are uſed in adminiſtering clyſters: a pair of bellows may be uſed until the others can be procured. A third attendant ſhould, in the mean time, rub the belly, cheſt, back and arms, with a coarſe cloth or flannel dipped in brandy, rum, gin, or with dry ſalt, ſo as not to rub off the ſkin: ſpirits of hartſhorn, volatile ſalts, or any other ſtimulating ſubſtance, muſt alſo be applied to the noſtrils, and rubbed upon the temples very frequently. The body muſt at intervals be ſhaken alſo, and varied in its poſition.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If there be any ſigns of returning life, ſuch as ſighing, gaſping, twitching, or any convulſive motions, beating of the heart, the return of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural colour and warmth; opening a vein in the arm or neck may prove beneficial, but the quantity of blood taken away ſhould not be large; nor ſhould any artery ever be opened, as profuſe bleeding has appeared prejudicial, and even deſtructive to the ſmall remains of life. The throat ſhould be tickled with a feather, in order to excite a propenſity to vomit; and the noſtrils alſo with a feather, ſnuff, or any other ſtimulant, ſo as to provoke ſneezings. A tea-ſpoonful of warm water may be adminiſtered now and then, in order to learn whether the power of ſwallowing be returned: and if it be, a table-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of warm wine, or brandy and water, may be given with advantage, but not before, as the liquor might get into the lungs before the power of ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returns. The other methods ſhould be continued with vigour, until the patient be gradually reſtored.</p>
                  <p>We have been as circumſtantial as poſſible in the above directions, that if one conveniency ſhould be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0490100900:54"/>wanting, the attendants may not be at a loſs for others. Where the patient has lain but a ſhort time ſenſeleſs, blowing into the lungs or bowels has been, in ſome caſes, found ſufficient; yet a ſpeedy recovery is not to be expected in general. On the contrary, the above methods are to be continued with ſpirit for two hours, or upwards, although there ſhould not be the leaſt ſymptoms of returning life. The vulgar notion; that a perſon will recover in a few minutes, or not at all; and the ignorant, fooliſh ridiculing of thoſe who are willing to perſevere, as if they were attempting impoſſibilities, has moſt certainly cauſed the death of many who might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the above rules are happily of ſuch a nature, that they may be begun immediately, and that by perſons who are not acquainted with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical art; yet it is always adviſeable to ſeek the aſſiſtance of ſome regular practitioner as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; not only as bleeding is proper, and frequently neceſſary; but as it is to be preſumed that ſuch a one will be more ſkilful and expert, and better able to vary the methods of procedure as circumſtances may require.</p>
                  <p>N. B. It is proper to obſerve, that theſe means of reſtoration are applicable to various other caſes of apparent deaths; ſuch as hanging, ſuffocation by damp and noxious vapours, whether proceeding from coal-mines, the confined air of wells, ciſterns, caves, or the muſt of fermenting liquors; to thoſe ſeized with apoplectic and convulſive fits, and alſo to the frozen.</p>
                  <p>Wherever any good has been produced by the means recommended, the perſon who has ſuperintended the cure is deſired to write a circumſtantial account of it to James Horsfall, Eſq; Treaſurer, Middle Temple, or Mr. M. Robinſon, Garden-Court, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Temple, Secretary to the Society.</p>

               <p>EVERY, perſon, who ſees others languiſhing under any ſickneſs or diſtemper, if he has a mind to preſerve himſelf from the infection, ought always to diſcharge his ſaliva, or ſpittle, and never ſwallow it, whilſt he remains in the ſphere of infected vapours; for the ſaliva is the firſt thing that very readily attracts the infected vapours, which being ſwallowed with it, are carried, as it were, by this vehicle into the ſtomach, where they occaſion moſt fatal effects.</p>
               <p>The greater part of diſtempers, and particularly malignant fevers, are contagious. This contagion, ariſing from the ferment that proceeds from the ſick perſon, diffuſes itſelf as a vapour in the ambient air, and infects every thing to a certain diſtance; ſo that theſe infected vapours, being drawn into the mouth by reſpiration, are capable of corrupting the ſaliva, which being ſwallowed, infects the ſtomach, and afterwards the reſt of the body. But when one ſpits, the body is ſecured from infection.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon tobacco, or ſpicey ſubſtances, or of a ſtrong ſmell, kept in the mouth and chewed, for exciting the ſaliva, may be of great ſervice to all thoſe who viſit infected perſons.</p>

               </head>
               <p>OF all the remedies recurred to in relieving the diſeaſed part of mankind, there are none of ſuch general ſervice and advantage, as that of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as there is no one, on the other hand, attended with more pernicious conſequences when indirectly and injudiciouſly ordered. A number of illneſſes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0490100900:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>are abſolutely owing to too great a quantity of blood; in which caſe there is ever of courſe an indiſpenſable neceſſity for proportionably draining this fluid.</p>
               <p>In all inflammatory diſtempers, it is next kin to a ſacrilege to omit it: as it is, on the contrary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the patient to the utmoſt hazard, to injoin it in a low, languid, depreſſed ſtate, where the ſpirits before were too much exhauſted, and nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, unable to ſupport the leaſt evacuation.</p>
               <p>In a word, wherever prevail ſore-eyes, a ſciatic, a dry, huſky cough, an head-ach, inflammations of the womb, or bladder, a virulent gonorrhoea, cordee, venereal ſtricture, inflamed piles, hot rheumatiſm, dry gripes, ſore throat, an aſthma, cholic, ſtrangury, gravel, nephretic pains, haemorrhages, an inveterate itch, and the like, the opening of a vein is of peculiar ſervice. But in dropſies, a jaundice, the gout, and all complaints ariſing from too great a relaxation of the veſſels, or obſtruction of them, remedies adapted to the reſpective diſorders muſt be ſought for from other ſpecific quarters, without the leaſt thought of increaſing thoſe diſorders, by abrupt and prepoſterous bleeding.</p>
