            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is ſufficient evidence that he had ſtudied botany and anatomy at <hi>Baſil,</hi> during the time that <hi>Caſpar</hi> BAUHINE held the profeſſorſhip in thoſe ſciences, for whom a chair was firſt erected in that city, in 1589. This celebrated profeſſor enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates Dr. CARGILL among thoſe who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0179600402:10"/>
tranſmitted ſeeds and ſpecimens to him. GESNER records the ſame ſervices on his part. At home, LOBEL, in his "<hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaria,</hi>" acknowledges the like communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and repeatedly ſpeaks of him in very reſpectable terms, as a philoſopher, and as well ſkilled in the ſciences of botany and anatomy. He appears to have been living in the year 1603; at which time he ſent to <hi>Caſpar</hi> BAUHINE ſpecimens of the <hi>Fucus digitatus,</hi> with the deſcription, which is ſeen in the "<hi>Prodromus</hi>" of that author. I know not of any publication from Dr. CARGILL, neither am I acquainted with any ſucceſsful efforts in the way of natural hiſtory, before the time of the BALFOURS.</p>
               <p>The founding of the Botanical Garden and the <hi>Muſeum</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> BALFOUR, may be conſidered as the introduction of natural hiſtory into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert</hi> SIBBALD, the friend and colleague of Sir <hi>Andrew</hi> BALFOUR, and who himſelf added to the ſtores of the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum,</hi> has written "<hi>Memoria Balfouriana,</hi>" purpoſely to commemorate the liberal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactions and encouragements given to

literature, by Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> and Sir <hi>Andrew</hi> BALFOUR.</p>
               <p>The Garden was eſtabliſhed about the year 1680; and, in 1683, was ſo ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cultivated by <hi>James</hi> SUTHERLAND, the-intendant, that it is ſaid to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained 3000 ſpecies of plants, diſpoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to MORISON's method. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it was publiſhed under the title of "HORTUS MEDICUS EDINBURGEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIS; or, a Catalogue of the Plants in the Phyſic Garden at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> containing their moſt proper <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> names." By <hi>James</hi> SUTHERLAND. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. pp. 367. Varieties, however, occupy a large ſhare of this Catalogue, and very few of the native plants of <hi>Scotland</hi> are found in it. It was to Sir <hi>Robert</hi> SIBBALD that the firſt attempts towards indigenous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany were owing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert</hi> SIBBALD was a fellow of the College of Phyſicians at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the firſt medical profeſſor inſtituted in that univerſity, about the year 1685. He was knighted by <hi>Charles</hi> II. and had alſo the title of king's phyſician and geographer
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0179600402:12"/>
royal conferred upon him, and was a man of very conſiderable and various learning. To the knowledge of his profeſſion, he added that of natural hiſtory, and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He was, if not the firſt, among the earlieſt, who wrote on the antiquities of his country, on which he publiſhed ſeveral learned works, to illuſtrate, more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the hiſtory of <hi>Scotland</hi> during the time of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He publiſhed, "SCOTIA ILLUSTRATA; <hi>ſive,</hi> PRODROMUS HISTORIAE NATURA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS SCOTIAE: <hi>in quo regionis natura, inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum ingenia et mores, morbi iiſque medendi methodus, et medicina indigena explicantur, et multiplices naturae partus, in triplici ejus reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, vegetabili ſcilicet, animali, et minerali ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicantur.</hi>" 1684, folio; and 1696, folio.</p>
               <p>In this volume, which, he tells us, was the work of twenty years, one part is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the indigenous plants of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> it contains obſervations on the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal and oeconomical uſes.

Dr. SIBBALD having thrown out ſome ſtrictures on the mathematical principles of phyſic, for which the learned Dr. PIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAIRN was a ſtrenuous advocate, the latter wrote a ſevere ſatire on this work, under the title "<hi>De Legibus Hiſtoriae Naturalis.</hi>" Edin. 1696. But it contains nothing ſolid, and was thought by ſome to have been the reſult of party, if not perſonal diſlike.</p>
               <p>Among the "<hi>Miſcellanea quaedam eruditae Antiquitatis</hi>" of Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> publiſhed in 1710, there is a Diſſertation on the <hi>Chara</hi> of CAESAR<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>In the zoological way, Dr. SIBBALD publiſhed ſeparately, "<hi>Phalainologia nova:</hi>" 1692. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. or, "Obſervations on ſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of the Whale Genus, lately thrown on the Shores of <hi>Scotland.</hi>" This tract had merit enough to entitle it to a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, ſo lately as in the year 1773. He meditated a <hi>Caetologia,</hi> together with the hiſtory of the other marine animals of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in his ſecond volume of the "<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromus.</hi>"</p>
               <p>In the year 1706, he communicated to the Royal Society an accurate deſcription, accompanied with a figure of the animal, and its ſhell, named <hi>Balanus Balenae,</hi> or <hi>Pediculus Ceti</hi> of BOCCONE (<hi>Lepas Diadema</hi> of LINNAEUS, <hi>Syſt.</hi> 1108.) Theſe were publiſhed in vol. xxv. of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> p. 2314.</p>
               <p>Although Sir <hi>Robert</hi> SIBBALD did not carry his reſearches ſo far, as to rank high in the character of the naturaliſt; yet, as

having led the way in that branch, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly promoted the ſtudy of the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his country, he is juſtly entitled to that honourable ſtation he bears among the writers of <hi>North-Britain</hi>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> ALSTON, as we are informed by Dr. HOPE, was the ſon of Mr. <hi>Alſton,</hi> of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0179600402:17"/>
                  <hi>Eddlewood;</hi> a gentleman of ſmall eſtate in the weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and allied to the noble family of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who, after having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died phyſic, and travelled with ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, declined the practice of his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and retired to his patrimony. His ſon <hi>Charles</hi> was born in the year 1683; and, at the time of his father's death, was at <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi> applying with great aſſiduity to his ſtudies. On this event, the Ducheſs of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> took him under her patronage, and wiſhed him to have choſen the department of the law; but his inclination for botany, and the ſtudy of phyſic, ſuperſeded all other ſchemes; and, from the year 1716, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted himſelf to phyſic.</p>
               <p>At the age of thirty-three, he went over to <hi>Leyden,</hi> to ſtudy under BOERHAAVE, where he remained near three years. At that place, he contracted an intimacy with the late celebrated Dr. <hi>Alexander</hi> MONRO; and, with him, on their return to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> projected the revival of medical lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; where, but little had been done in that department, ſince the firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the medical profeſſorſhips in 1665,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0179600402:18"/>
under Sir <hi>Robert</hi> SIBBALD, and Dr. PIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAIRN. The plan was modelled by that of <hi>Leyden.</hi> MONRO was appointed to give lectures in anatomy, and ſurgery; and AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STON in botany, and the <hi>materia medica.</hi> RUTHERFORD, SINCLAIR, and PLUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER, were ſoon after appointed to fill up the other departments: and, to the ſpirited endeavours of theſe celebrated names, the univerſity of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> owes the riſe of that reputation, which has ſince ſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly raiſed it to be one of the firſt ſchools of phyſic in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. ALSTON continued to teach botany, and the <hi>materia medica,</hi> with unwearied aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, until the time of his death, which took place Nov. 22, 1760, in the 77th year of his age.</p>
               <p>In 1740, Dr. ALSTON publiſhed for the uſe of his pupils, "INDEX PLANTARUM <hi>praecipue</hi> OFFICINALIUM, <hi>quae in Horto Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico Edinburgenſi, Studioſis demonſtrantur.</hi>" 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</p>
               <p>In 1752, "INDEX MEDICAMENTORUM SIMPLICIUM TRIPLEX." 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. pp. 172. 1. <hi>Alphabetical;</hi> the officinal names, with numerous ſynonyms, from the beſt botani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

A table of the doſes of emetics and purgatives.</p>
               <p>In botany, Dr. ALSTON's chief perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was, his "<hi>Tirocinium Botanicum Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgenſe.</hi>" 1753. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> It contains a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of his "<hi>Index,</hi>" firſt printed in 1740; to which he now added the "<hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenta Botanica</hi>" of LINNAEUS. But the bulk of the work is a profeſſed attempt to explode the ſyſtem of the <hi>Swede,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to invalidate all his arguments for the <hi>ſex</hi> of plants. This part of it was tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by himſelf, and publiſhed the next year in the firſt volume of "Eſſays and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, phyſical and literary." 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Could the doctrine of the <hi>ſexes</hi> of plants have been eaſily ſhaken, the learning and abilities of ALSTON were ſufficient to have effected his purpoſe. But as it was not at that time ſupported by hypotheſis alone, ſo it has ſince gained additional ſtrength, by new
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0179600402:20"/>
experiments, and ſound inductions, reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them. Nurtured from his early years in the ſyſtems of TOURNEFORT, RAY, and BOERHAAVE, to the firſt of which he had even given improvement, it is not ſtrange, that, at an advanced age, Dr. ALSTON rejected a ſyſtem of ſo much novelty, as that of LINNAEUS preſented. We do not willingly unlearn at ſixty, what has been cheriſhed from our earlieſt youth.</p>
               <p>Dr. ALSTON's medical papers are, "A Diſſertation on <hi>Tin</hi> as an Anthelmintic;" "A Diſſertation on <hi>Opium;</hi>" and "A Caſe of extravaſated Blood in the <hi>Pericardium.</hi>" Theſe are printed in the <hi>Edinburgh Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Eſſays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1743, he diſcovered a property in quick lime, which led him to believe, that the power of lime was not exhauſted by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affuſions of water to the ſame lime; he adds, even for twenty or thirty times. The firſt notices of this paradox, as he then called it, were communicated to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and were printed in the forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeventh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0179600402:21"/>
volume of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</hi> This opinion was conteſted, and drew him into a controverſy with his friend and colleague, Dr. WHYTT. Having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his experiments, and enlarged his obſervations, he publiſhed, in 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>2, his "Diſſertation on Quick-Lime and Limo Water;" republiſhed in 1754, and in 1757; in which he replies to Dr. WHYTT's Strictures; and, after enumerating a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of diſeaſes, in which lime water has proved efficacious, confirms the opinion of his colleague, relating to its lithontriptic powers.</p>
               <p>Dr. ALSTON's Lectures on the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> were prepared for the preſs before his deceaſe, and were publiſhed under the following title:</p>
               <p>"Lectures on the <hi>Materia Medica;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Natural Hiſtory of Drugs, their Virtues and Doſes: alſo, Directions for the Study of the <hi>Materia Medica;</hi> and an Appendix on the Method of Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing.

of Botany, and the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> in the Univerſity of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> By <hi>John</hi> HOPE, M.D. Profeſſor of Medicine and Botany in that Univerſity." In two vol. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1770. pp. 544 and 584.</p>
               <p>The firſt eleven lectures conſiſt of preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary diſcourſes; on the riſe and progreſs of this knowledge; on the operation of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; of errors concerning the <hi>materia medica;</hi> on claſſing ſimples according to their virtues; and ſome account of authors who have written on ſimples.</p>
               <p>In treating on each ſubject, after reciting the officinal name, and the principal <hi>ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma,</hi> the deſcription, and place of growth, Dr. ALSTON gives, in his own words, the ſenſible qualities, powers, and uſes of each ſimple; after which follows, in the words of the authors themſelves, a copious detail of the opinions of reſpectable writers, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to each; concluding with a recital of all the officinal compounds into which each ſimple enters. Add to this, the reader will meet with a variety of collateral, and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical information, which is highly gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0179600402:23"/>
to all ſuch as wiſh to extend their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries beyond the mere nomenclature, and quality of each ſubſtance; and which could otherwiſe be acquired only from laborious reſearches.</p>
               <p>Although the reader will not find the author giving implicit belief to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and vaunted powers, attributed to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs ſimples, through almoſt all preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing writers; but on the contrary, will meet with judicious doubts, obſervations, and experiments, yet, Dr. ALSTON's <hi>Materia Medica</hi> muſt be conſidered, on the whole, as exhibiting rather the ſtate of it, as it has been, than as it is, in the works of LEWIS, BERGIUS, MURRAY, and CUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN. It is but of late that philoſophers and phyſicians have exerciſed that degree of ſcepticiſm on the power of tmedicines, which muſt ever influence the mind, when experiments alone form the foundation of medical practice.</p>
               <p>Were it within my plan to extend my obſervations, I ſhould, with grateful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, expatiate on the improved ſtate of

               <p>IT has been the fate of many learned men, who have deſerved highly of the republic of letters, to have the private cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and occurrences of their lives, in a few years, ſo far involved in obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that almoſt their immediate poſterity, howſoever deſirous of gratifying a natural and laudable curioſity, and of rendering to their memory that tribute which their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices have demanded, have been almoſt wholly fruſtrated in their endeavours to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue them from oblivion.</p>

If I miſtake not, the truth of this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtrongly exemplified, in the perſon, of whom, in the order of time, I am next to ſpeak. Of Dr. <hi>Leonard</hi> PLUKENET, as far as I can find, there are ſcarcely any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, but what are to be collected from the prefaces of his works; and they afford indeed very ſcanty information. He has told us, that he was born in 1642; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was of <hi>Engliſh</hi> origin, and of what family, does not certainly appear; though it has been conjectured, that he was of <hi>French</hi> extraction. Where he received his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic education, or at what place he took degrees in phyſic, I am not able to aſcertain. Some light would be thrown on this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance indeed, by determining, where his two friends, <hi>William</hi> COURTEN, Eſq. and the Rev. Dr. UVEDALE, of <hi>Enfield,</hi> were educated; ſince he ſpeaks of both theſe gentlemen, as having been his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pupils: probably it was at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as he had a ſon, named <hi>Richard,</hi> purſuing his ſtudies in that univerſity, at the publication of his <hi>Almageſtum,</hi> in 1696. Be that as it may, his writings ſufficiently teſtify his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0179600402:27"/>
knowledge of the learned languages. He dates the prefaces to his works, from Old Palace Yard, <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> where, from a circumſtance mentioned in his <hi>Phytogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> it may be inferred, that he had a ſmall garden. I know not that he ever attained to any conſiderable eminence as a practical phyſician. The contrary may rather be preſumed, as I do not find his name in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral liſts of the College of Phyſicians, printed in the firſt years of this century: neither in thoſe of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> at the ſame period.</p>
               <p>His ardour for his favourite purſuit was remarkably ſtrong; <hi>Ut pene nullus, ſic ardeo,</hi> was his motto. It does not appear, that he ever had an opportunity of gratifying his taſte by travelling in ſearch of plants. He ſeems to have devoted all his leiſure to his work of the <hi>Phytographia;</hi> ſparing no pains to procure ſpecimens of rare, and new plants. He had correſpondents in all parts of the world; and had acceſs to the gardens of the curious, in the environs of <hi>London,</hi> and to that at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> which was in a flouriſhing ſtate, from the care which the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0179600402:28"/>
king and queen beſtowed on it. The Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> alſo, had ſo much reliſh for exotics, as to have repeatedly ſent <hi>Jacob</hi> REEDE to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> to collect cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious productions for the Royal Garden. PLUKENET was one of thoſe to whom Mr. RAY was indebted for aſſiſtance in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the ſecond volume of his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and that eminent man, every where bears the ſtrongeſt teſtimony to his merit. Nevertheleſs PLUKENET wanted that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, to which his learning, and ſcience, entitled him; and he ſeems, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, to have ſeverely felt it. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his life, he appears to have been at variance with SLOANE and PETIVER; two of the firſt characters of the age, for knowledge in his own ſtudies. He cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures their writings, it muſt be confeſſed, in a ſtile of too much aſperity. Whether this alienation from thoſe of whom he had before ſpoken in terms of friendſhip, and reſpect, had its origin in jealouſy on the one hand, or what is more probable, on the other, in that indignant loftineſs, which too often accompanies the conſciouſneſs of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0179600402:29"/>
neglected merit; or whether from other ſources, I cannot determine. It was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever probably unfavourable to PLUKENET, ſince SLOANE was at that time riſing faſt into reputation, and influence. In the mean while, no obſtacles damped the zeal of PLUKENET; he was himſelf at the expence of his engravings, and printed the work at his own charge, until the publication of the laſt part, his <hi>Amaltheum,</hi> when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a trifling ſubſcription from a few of the nobility, amounting to about fifty-five guineas. Towards the cloſe of his life, he is ſaid to have been aſſiſted by the queen, and to have obtained the ſuperintendency of the garden at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the title of Royal Profeſſor of Botany.</p>
               <p>I cannot diſcover the exact time of his deceaſe; but it is probable he did not long ſurvive his laſt publication, in 1705.</p>
               <p>There is a copper-plate print of Dr. PLUKENET, done in the 48th year of his age, prefixed to the <hi>Phytographia;</hi> with his arms, field ermine, bearing a bend dexter engrailed gules.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0179600402:30"/>
PLUKENET had all that enthuſiaſm, without which, few attain pre-eminence; and as the riches of <hi>Flora</hi> were daily pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Britain,</hi> from all quarters of the globe, he failed not to avail himſelf of every opportunity of adding to his ſtores. Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genous ſubjects were, equally with exotics, the objects of this induſtrious, and learned collector. Hence at length, his <hi>Herbarium</hi> conſiſted of eight thouſand plants; an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing number for a private, unopulent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual to collect! Of theſe, the <hi>Phytogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> is to be conſidered as the delineation of the new and rare kinds; and the <hi>Almageſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Mantiſſa,</hi> and <hi>Amaltheum,</hi> as the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the whole.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phytographia</hi> was publiſhed at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times. The firſt part under the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing title:</p>

PLUKENET's work contains upwards of 2740 figures. Moſt of them were engraved from dried ſpecimens, and many from ſmall ſprigs, deſtitute of flowers, or any parts of fructification, and conſequently not to be aſcertained: ſeveral of theſe, nevertheleſs, as better ſpecimens came to hand, are figured a ſecond time, in the ſubſequent plates. As he employed a variety of artiſts, they are very unequally done: thoſe by <hi>Vander Gucht</hi> have uſually the preference. The imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this work, however, are, in a great degree, thoſe of the times; yet it cannot but be regretted that PLUKENET had it not in his power to have given his figures on a larger ſcale. There are unqueſtionably many varieties exhibited as real ſpecies; and one great defect runs nearly through the whole work, that the new plants are no further deſcribed, than by the ſpecifical definitions, which, under the want of true generical characters, were then inſufficient.</p>
               <p>It is, notwithſtanding, a large magazine of botanical ſtores; inaſmuch as, no work before publiſhed by one man, ever exhibited ſo great a number of new plants. And as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0179600402:35"/>
many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpecies are here figured, for the firſt time, it has been equally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the lovers of indigenous, as of exotic botany.</p>
               <p>LINNAEUS, and others, mention a new edition of PLUKENET's works in 1720. But this was nothing more than the uſual artifice of the bookſeller; who, having purchaſed the remaining copies, placed a new title-page. They were, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and divided into four volumes, in 1769, with the addition of a few plates, that were wanting in ſome copies of the fourth part of the <hi>Phyiographia.</hi> Thoſe who occaſionally conſult this author, will regret, that this opportunity had not been taken, of inſerting the additions from the <hi>Mantiſſa</hi> into the <hi>Almageſtum,</hi> by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them in a ſmaller character, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the pages for both in the margin. The <hi>Herbarium</hi> of PLUKENET came into Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE's poſſeſſion, and is now in the <hi>Britiſh Muſeum.</hi>

               <p>In 1779, an <hi>Index Linnaeanus</hi> to the tables was publiſhed by Dr. GISEKE, profeſſor of poetry, and natural philoſophy, in the <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſium</hi>

               <p>Dr. PLUKENET has not failed to record the names of a numerous ſet of benefactors, by whoſe communications he was, from time to time, enabled to amplify his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and introduce many new plants to the knowledge of the curious.

Some of theſe I ſhall have occaſion to commemorate in ſeparate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; but I regret that I cannot collect any material anecdotes relating to his friend and fellow collegian, — UVEDALE, LL.D. of whom PLUKENET ever ſpeaks in a ſtile which indicates that he held him in great eſteem.</p>

               <p>CONTEMPORARY with PLUKENET lived Mr. <hi>James</hi> PETIVER, of whom too little intelligence is remaining.</p>
               <p>It appears that he was apprenticed to Mr. <hi>Feltham,</hi> apothecary to <hi>St. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew's Hoſpital.</hi> He entered into buſineſs for himſelf in <hi>Alderſgate Street,</hi> where he lived the remainder of his days. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came apothecary to the <hi>Charter Houſe,</hi> and obtained a conſiderable ſhare of practice in his profeſſion.</p>
               <p>He had an early propenſity to theſe ſtudies, and, excepting Mr. COURTEN, and Dr. SLOANE, ſeems to have been the <hi>only</hi> one, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0179600402:39"/>
the TRADESCANTS, who made any conſiderable collection in natural hiſtory. PETIVER engaged the captains, and ſurgeons of ſhips, to bring home ſpecimens, and ſeeds of plants, birds, ſtuffed animals, and inſects; and he directed their choice, and enabled them to judge, in ſome meaſure, of proper objects, by diſtributing printed liſts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections among them. He was not leſs anxious to procure, what his native country afforded, and was ſo ſucceſsful in his efforts, that Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, who afterwards purchaſed it, offered PETIVER four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds for his <hi>Muſeum,</hi> ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death: which offer, although it may be conſidered as a proof of the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Sir <hi>Hans,</hi> is equally ſo of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the collection.</p>
               <p>The allurement of ſuch uncommon cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities as Mr. PETIVER exhibited, ſoon obtained him conſiderable diſtinction, and his name became well known, both at home and abroad. He was elected into the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> and as his particular attachment was to plants, he became early the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent of Mr. RAY, who acknowledges
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0179600402:40"/>
his aſſiſtance in arranging the ſecond vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of his "Hiſtory of Plants;" and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where owns his high obligations to him, for the extent and freedom of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications.</p>
               <p>In the year 1692, preparatory to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of his firſt work, PETIVER took a tour into the midland counties of England. I recollect, on this occaſion, the pleaſure I had in my youth, in ſeeing the <hi>Lichen ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus</hi> growing on the ſpot, where, I believe, he firſt diſcovered it, on the higheſt rocks in <hi>Charley Foreſt, Leiceſterſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. PETIVER's firſt publication was, "MUSEI PETIVERIANI <hi>Centuriae decem.</hi>" 1692-1703. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Containing the names, and ſynonyms of various rare animals, foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, and plants; among which, ſeveral cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious articles, the produce of <hi>England,</hi> are here firſt exhibited; particularly ſome of the <hi>Cryptogamous</hi> claſs, in the inveſtigation of which he was very ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>"GAZOPHYLACII NATURAE <hi>et</hi> ARTIS <hi>Decades decem.</hi>" 1702. tab. 100. fol. A book of great value at the time of its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being the engravings, accompanied with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0179600402:41"/>
ſhort deſcriptions, of animals of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vegetables, and foſſils: among theſe are many <hi>American</hi> ferns, plants of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and from the <hi>Cape of Good Hope;</hi> all, either very rarely ſeen before, or nondeſcripts. It will retain its value while LINNAEUS's wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are in uſe.</p>
               <p>Among the provincial liſts of plants, printed in Biſhop GIBSON's edition of CAMDEN in 1695, Mr. PETIVER com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the <hi>Middleſex</hi> plants. All the others were drawn up by Mr. RAY, as was obſerved under his article.</p>
               <p>Next to the <hi>Gazophylacium</hi> in the order of time, although not a diſtinct work, was publiſhed, in Mr. RAY's third volume of his Hiſtory of Plants, "PLANTAE RARIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RES CHINENSES, MADRASPATANAE <hi>et</hi> AFRICANAE, <hi>à Jacobo</hi> PETIVERO, <hi>ad Opus conſummandum collatae: cum ejuſdem Catalogo Plantarum in Hortis ſuis ſiccis conſervatarum, quae vel ineditae, aut hactenus obſcurè deſcriptae ſunt: adjicitur Farrago Stirpium Indicarum, et Americanarum incertae Sedis.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe catalogues amounts to 184 plants: thoſe of the <hi>Hortus ſiccus,</hi> to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0179600402:42"/>
more than 800 ſpecies: the laſt to 75. Although doubtleſs great numbers of theſe muſt have been varieties only, theſe liſts will yet remain a laſting teſtimony of the early and extreme diligence of this indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable collector.</p>
               <p>In 1709, he publiſhed, without his name, "A Catalogue of Plants found on the mountains about <hi>Geneva,</hi> the <hi>Jura, La Dole, Saleve;</hi> with others growing in the fields, &amp;c. as obſerved by GESNER, the BAUHINES, CHABRAEUS, and RAY."</p>

The ferns occupy ſixteen of theſe tables. Among theſe are contained moſt of Father PLUMIER's ferns. The four remaining tables are of ſubmarine productions.</p>
               <p>Mr. PETIVER neglected no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of augmenting the <hi>Engliſh Flora.</hi> He was the firſt diſcoverer of many <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants, as well as of other natural produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome of which he figured in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zophylacium;</hi> but he meditated, and in part executed, (a work that had not been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0179600402:43"/>
before) a ſet of diſtinct figures of <hi>Britiſh</hi> plants. Unfortunately he lived not to finiſh it.</p>
               <p>This work, which diſtinguiſhes PETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER as an auxiliary to <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany, bears the title of "A Catalogue of Mr. RAY's <hi>Engliſh Herbal,</hi> illuſtrated with Figures." fol. 1713. t. 50; and continued "with the four-leaved flowers," t. 51-72. fol. 1715. Twelve plants are engraved on each plate. The work ends with the ſeventeenth claſs. The figures are little more than outlines, but they are neat; and though they have the defect of the old herbals, in being all on a ſimilar ſcale, were valuable, and eſpecially as pointing out many of the varieties in the <hi>Synopſis</hi> of RAY, particularly among the <hi>Apetalous</hi> and <hi>Syngeneſious</hi> tribes. A new impreſſion of theſe plates was made under the inſpection of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, in 1732.</p>

               <p>Mr. PETIVER was among the firſt who purſued the idea that the virtues of plants might be determined, in general, by their agreements in natural characters and claſſes. I ſay purſued, becauſe the idea had been ſuggeſted long before. Even CAESALPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS, the inventor of ſyſtem, hints that the virtues of plants are pointed out by their ſtructure, and alliance to each other. Theſe are his words: <hi>Tandem et facultates, quas medici maxime quaerunt, tanquam proprietates innoteſcunt ex naturarum cognitione: quae enim generis ſocietate junguntur, plerumque et ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les poſſident facultates</hi>

               <p>PETIVER and PLUKENET, as far as I can find, were the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> writers, who followed the example of PLUMIER in giving perſonal names to new <hi>genera.</hi> PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVER is, however, ſeverely reprehended by LINNAEUS, for having conferred this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on ſome who did not merit it: He obſerves juſtly, that it is due to ſuch alone, as have ſignalized themſelves in the ſcience. I take this opportunity to remark the riſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0179600402:52"/>
and progreſs of this euſtom, which appears to be of high antiquity, ſince there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it among the antient poets, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and phyſicians.</p>
               <p>Poetry has conſecrated, in this way, the names of <hi>Adonis, Daphne, Hyacinthus, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus,</hi> and others. PLINY informs us, that <hi>Eupatorium</hi> is ſaid to be the cognomen of MITHRIDATES, who firſt diſcovered the uſes of that plant. <hi>Gentiana,</hi> we are told, is derived from GENTIUS, king of <hi>Illyria: Lyſimachia,</hi> from LYSIMACHUS, king of <hi>Sicily: Telephium,</hi> from TELEPHUS, king of <hi>Myſia: Teucrium,</hi> from TEUCER, king of <hi>Troy: Clymenum,</hi> from CLYMENUS: <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſia,</hi> from the wife of king MAUSOLUS: <hi>Helenium,</hi> from HELENA, the wife of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus: Euphorbium,</hi> from EUPHORBUS, phyſician to <hi>Juba</hi> II. king of <hi>Mauritania;</hi> though SALMASIUS avers, that this name had been in uſe at a much earlier period. Many other inſtances might be adduced.</p>
               <p>In ſucceeding ages, the devotion of the monks led them to conſecrate a variety of plants to the ſaints of the kalendar. Thus we have the <hi>Herba Sancti</hi> ANTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NII,

               <p>The reſtorers of botany, in a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, revived the practice. GESNER, had he lived to finiſh his plan in his "Hiſtory of Plants," intended to have perpetuated the names of his friends, by monuments of this kind. It appears, that he had requeſted GUILANDINUS, <hi>John</hi> BAUHINE, KENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN, CAMERARIUS, and our celebrated countryman Dr. CAIUS, to ſelect from his new ſpecies, ſuch as they choſe to bear their names, or allow to him the privilege of adopting what he thought moſt congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. By the ſame kind of tribute we learn, from his letters, that he propoſed to record the names of his friends GASSERUS, OCCO, ARETIUS, and ſeveral others.</p>
               <p>MATTHIOLUS, however, actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the uſage, by the application of the term <hi>Cortuſa</hi> to a new plant, in honour of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0179600402:54"/>
CORTUSUS, the ſucceſſor of GUILANDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS, in the garden of <hi>Padua;</hi> and CLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIUS followed his example, by calling the <hi>Contrayerva</hi> of the ſhops <hi>Drakaena,</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> DRAKE; from which time it was ſparingly practiſed, until after the invention of ſyſtem; and the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of generical characters, at the latter end of the laſt century. TOURNEFORT, PLUMIER, and PETIVER, led the way, and have been followed by all ſucceeding writers of note, and by none more than by LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS himſelf. It may be ſtiled the <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis</hi> of botaniſts; and LINNAEUS may be compared to the high prieſt, who has thus immortalized a numerous group of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated men.</p>
               <p>The practice, however, was ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſome of the older botaniſts, who objected, that theſe names, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the form, nature, habit, or properties of the plant, conveyed no idea of diſtinction. But the objection, if duly weighed, is of no force; ſince there is not, perhaps, a ſingle appellation, even among the beſt, of <hi>Greek</hi> etymology, however aptly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0179600402:55"/>
framed, which conveys any character of the genus, that might not with equal propriety have been applied to a multitude of others.</p>
               <p>The free uſe that PLUMIER made of this privilege, in honouring ſo great a number of Engliſhmen, does equal credit to his own diſcernment, and impartiality, and to the merit of thoſe on whom he beſtowed this laurel. On this account, I hope it may not be ungrateful to the reader, to digreſs ſo far, as to introduce a ſhort notice of this liberal-minded foreigner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> PLUMIER was born at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> in the year 1646; and, after a claſſical edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, devoted himſelf to a religious life; and, at the age of ſixteen, entered into the order of the <hi>Minime Friars.</hi> Being early inclined to mechanics and philoſophy, he ſtudied mathematics, at <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> under <hi>Pére Maignan,</hi> a celebrated profeſſor of the ſcience, and of the ſame order. In ſome of his leiſure hours, he amuſed himſelf in the practice of Turning, having been taught theart by his father; and became ſo great
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0179600402:56"/>
a proficient, that he wrote a book on the ſubject. Under <hi>Pére Maignan,</hi> he alſo learned to make lenſes, mirrors, micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes, and other inſtruments of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and early acquired the arts of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and painting. He was ſoon after ſent by his ſuperiors to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his cloſe application to his ſtudies, and to theſe arts, together with optics and mathematics, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged his health. In this ſituation, he ſought for relaxation in the ſtudy of botany, under the lectures of <hi>Pére</hi> SERGEANT, in a convent at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the inſtructions of <hi>Francis de</hi> ONUPHRIIS, an Italian phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and of <hi>Sylvius</hi> BOCCONE, a Sicilian. By theſe connections, he was inſenſibly led to devote himſelf to his new ſtudy. Being recalled by his order into <hi>Provence,</hi> he was placed in a convent near <hi>Hyeres,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave of his ſuperiors to ſearch the coaſts of that country, and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alps, for plants. At this time, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a deſign of forming a new <hi>Pinax,</hi> or "General Hiſtory of Vegetables," for which he had made many drawings, and collected materials; but his ſubſequent deſtination

               <p>Thus qualified, and while he was herbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing on the coaſt of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> he was choſen as the aſſociate of SURIAN, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the French ſettlements in the Weſt Indies.

He paſſed two years in thoſe iſlands, and on the neighbouring continent; but made <hi>Domingo</hi> his principal reſidence. He made deſigns and paintings of many hundred plants, on a ſcale as large as the life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides numerous figures of birds, fiſhes, and inſects.</p>

On his return from his ſecond voyage, by the intereſt of M. PONTCHARTRAIN, he procured the firſt ſpecimen of his labours to be publiſhed at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> under the title of "<hi>Deſcription des Plantes de l' Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique.</hi>" Fol. 1695. pp. 94. tab. 108. The firſt fifty of theſe tables repreſent Ferns; the remainder, divers ſpecies of the <hi>Arum</hi> genus; the <hi>Piper, Paſſiflorae, Rajania, Dolichos,</hi> and various others. The figures conſiſt of little more than outlines; but being as large as the life, and drawn with great accuracy and freedom, they have a very fine effect. The deſcriptions are in French.</p>
               <p>On his return from the third voyage, he ſettled at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the character of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and, in 1703, publiſhed his "<hi>Nova Plantarum Genera.</hi>" 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

               <p>In the year 1704, he was prevailed on by M. FAGON, to undertake a voyage to <hi>Peru,</hi> to diſcover and delineate the <hi>Peruvian Bark</hi> tree. Nothing but the greateſt zeal for ſcience, could induce a man at the age of fifty-eight, to attempt ſo perilous a voyage.

               <p>We are informed by Dr. LISTER, that PLUMIER left behind him drawings of plants, ſufficient to make ten volumes, equal to the firſt book above mentioned. They are ſaid to have amounted to 1400. Some of theſe remained in the convent at <hi>Paris,</hi> to which PLUMIER belonged: others were in the King's library. From the latter, BOERHAAVE procured copies of 508 ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, done by AUBRIET, under the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of VAILLANT. Theſe were publiſhed in 1755-1760, by Profeſſor BURMAN, at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in ten <hi>faſciculi,</hi> accompanied with 262 plates, on which are engraven upwards of 400 ſpecies: and Dr. BLOCH, of <hi>Berlin,</hi> has procured many of the fiſhes for his late ſplendid work on ichthyology.</p>

                  <hi>JOHN</hi> BANISTER, is mentioned by Mr. RAY in very high terms, as a man of talents in natural hiſtory. He firſt made a voyage to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time; but was afterwards fixed in <hi>Virginia.</hi> In that country he induſtriouſly ſought for plants, deſcribed them, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf drew the figures of the rare ſpecies: he was alſo celebrated for his knowledge of inſects, and meditated writing the natural hiſtory of <hi>Virginia,</hi> for which, Mr. RAY
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0179600402:63"/>
obſerves that he was every way qualified, He ſent to RAY, in 1680, "A Catalogue of Plants obſerved by him in <hi>Virginia;</hi>" which was publiſhed in the ſecond volume of RAY's Hiſtory, p. 1928.</p>
               <p>The world was deprived of much of the fruit of his labours, by his untimely death. BANISTER increaſed the liſt of martyrs to natural hiſtory. In one of his excurſions, in purſuit of his object, he fell from the rocks, and periſhed. His <hi>Herbarium</hi> came into the poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, who thought it a conſiderable acquiſition.</p>

               <head>VERNON AND KREIG.</head>
               <p>About the ſame time with BANISTER, as I conjecture, Mr. <hi>William</hi> VERNON, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of St. Peter's College, <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Dr. <hi>David</hi> KREIG, a German phyſician, led by their genius for botany, made a voyage to <hi>Maryland.</hi> They returned, after having collected an <hi>Herbarium</hi> of ſeveral hundred new and undeſcribed plants. Theſe came into the poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, by whoſe liberal communication they were inſerted in the "Supplement" to RAY's Hiſtory. Mr. VERNON is alſo ſpoken of by RAY, as not leſs ſkilful and aſſiduous in the purſuit of <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0179600402:65"/>
and of all other branches of natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. His diſcoveries in the <hi>Cryptogamia</hi> claſs were numerous.</p>
               <p>Of Dr. KREIG, I can give no further account than that he was of <hi>Saxony.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that after his return from <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he retired into his native country. He was the friend and correſpondent of DALE, who, in his <hi>Pharmacologia,</hi> introduces his name in the moſt reſpectful manner, for notices communicated by him; and ranks him among the few eminent men of the time, who excelled in the knowledge of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica</hi> and Chemiſtry. Dr. KREIG was not living when DALE publiſhed the third edition of the above-mentioned work, in 1737.</p>
               <p>Dr. KREIG communicated to the Royal Society, "An Account of Cobalt and the Preparation of Smalt and Arſenic," ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proceſs uſed at the mines of <hi>Shneebergh,</hi> in <hi>Hermanduria.</hi> It was printed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 293.

               <head>CUNNINGHAM.</head>
               <p>In the period we are now ſpeaking of, but few voyagers poſſeſſed any conſiderable knowledge of nature; or a ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, powerful enough to induce them to ſacrifice their avocations, from intereſted purſuits, to the ſtudy of natural hiſtory. SLOANE, BANISTER, and a few others, were indeed exceptions; and, in this ſketch, it would be injurious to his memory, not to add the name of <hi>James</hi> CUNNINGHAM, to whom RAY, and particularly PLUKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET and PETIVER, acknowledge important obligations, for his copious communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of new plants.</p>
               <p>The merit of Mr. CUNNINGHAM would juſtly demand a more complete gratification of curioſity concerning his life and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, than I can ſupply. I can only collect, that he went out in 1698, as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to the factory, eſtabliſhed by the Eaſt India Company at <hi>Emuy,</hi> or <hi>Amoy,</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>China;</hi> and afterwards, made a

ſecond voyage in the ſame capacity, to the ſubſequent eſtabliſhment at <hi>Kuſan,</hi> or <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> in 1700, on which iſland he reſided ſome time.</p>
               <p>I conjecture alſo, that he was afterwards fixed at <hi>Pulo Condore,</hi> and was the perſon to whom we owe the account of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the <hi>Macaſſars,</hi> at that factory, in 1705, as related in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Part of the <hi>Univerſal Hiſtory,</hi> vol. x. p. 154; edit. 1759. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</p>
               <p>Mr. CUNNINGHAM kept a journal of the weather in both his voyages to <hi>China;</hi> and during his reſidence on the iſle of <hi>Chuſan,</hi> he appears to have been very active in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the productions of that place. He ſent over to PLUKENET and PETIVER a very large number of new plants, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from an inſpection of their writings. In the "<hi>Amaltheum</hi>" of PLUKENET, his name occurs in almoſt every page.</p>
               <p>From the iſland of <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> Mr. CUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NINGHAM tranſmitted to PETIVER an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the plants, and ſhells, he obſerved there. He ſent a journal of his voyage,

It conveys many intereſting particulars to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader, relating to the inhabitants, their fiſheries, agriculture, and arts.

               <p>AT the ſame period of time, lived RAY, MORISON, PLUKENET, PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVER, SLOANE, and SHERARD, under whoſe countenance, and culture, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature received the moſt rapid and ſubſtantial improvement, which it had ever experienced. In this period, ſyſtem had been revived and improved by MORISON, RAY, HERMAN, TOURNEFORT, and RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINUS. In this period alſo, RHEDE, RUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIUS, PLUMIER, and SLOANE, publiſhed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0179600402:73"/>
thoſe great works in exotic botany, which have immortalized their names. This pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod was the cloſe of the laſt century; which, as it has been called by the elegant and learned author of the "Eſſay on the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Writings of Pope," <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Age of Learning in <hi>England;</hi>"</q> ſo has LINNAEUS named it, in his Allegorical Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Riſe and Progreſs of this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, "The GOLDEN AGE OF BOTANY;" and SLOANE was one of its brighteſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Of the life of this great patron of natural ſcience, it would be ſuperfluous in me to attempt a detailed account; ſince this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute has been paid to his memory in the "Eloge of the <hi>French</hi> Academy," in the "<hi>Biographia Britannica,</hi>" the "Biographical Dictionary," and other collections of that kind, in daily uſe. Hence, I ſhall, from theſe publications, extract only the outlines of his life, as they are connected with, and tend to clucidate, his general character, his acquirements in natural hiſtory, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical publications.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE was deſcended from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0179600402:74"/>
parents, originally of <hi>Scottiſh</hi> extraction, and was born at <hi>Killileagh,</hi> in the county of <hi>Down,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> April 16, 1660. His younger years were marked by a ſtrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the works of nature. At ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, his ſtudies were interrupted by ill health, in conſequence of a ſpitting of blood, which confined him for three years. On his amendment, he ſtudied the preliminary branches of phyſic in <hi>London,</hi> for four years; chemiſtry, under a pupil of the great STAHL; his favourite ſcience, at <hi>Chelſea</hi> Garden, then but juſt eſtabliſhed; and, young as he was, contracted during that time, an acquaintance with BOYLE and RAY. Mr. SLOANE afterwards, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Mr. <hi>Tancred</hi> ROBINSON, and another ſtudent, viſited <hi>France</hi> for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At <hi>Paris,</hi> he attended TOURNE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORT and DU VERNEY; and is ſuppoſed to have taken his degrees in medicine at <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier;</hi> ſome ſay, at <hi>Orange.</hi> He returned to <hi>London</hi> at the latter end of the year 1684, and became the favourite of Dr. SYDEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, who took him into his houſe, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly promoted his intereſt. In November
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0179600402:75"/>
1684, he was elected a fellow of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> and, in April 1687, entered into the college of phyſicians. Theſe early ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements in the profeſſional line, are the ſtrongeſt preſumptions in favour of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior knowledge, and promiſing abilities. Yet theſe flattering proſpects he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, to gratify his ardour for natural knowledge.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of September 1687, and in the 28th year of his age, he embarked for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> as phyſician to the Duke of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle;</hi> and touched at <hi>Madeira, Barbadoes, Nevis,</hi> and <hi>St. Kitt's.</hi> The Duke dying on the 19th of December, ſoon after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> Dr. SLOANE's ſtay on the iſland did not exceed fifteen months. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time, however, ſuch was his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that, in the language of his <hi>French</hi> eulogiſt, had he not converted, as it were, his minutes into hours, he could not have made thoſe numerous acquiſitions, which contributed ſo largely to extend the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature; while they laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own future ſame and fortune.</p>
               <p>Here I am led to obſerve, that ſeveral
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0179600402:76"/>
circumſtances concurred reſpecting the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Dr. SLOANE to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which rendered it peculiarly ſucceſsful to natural hiſtory. He was the firſt man of learning, whom the love of ſcience alone had led from <hi>England,</hi> to that diſtant part of the globe; and, conſequently, the field was wholly open to him. He was already well acquainted with the diſcoveries of the age. He had an enthuſiaſm for his object, and was at an age, when both activity of body, and vivacity of mind, concur to vanquiſh difficulties. Under this happy coincidence of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it is not ſtrange that Dr. SLOANE returned home with a rich harveſt. In fact, beſides a proportional number of ſubjects from the animal kingdom, he brought from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and the other iſlands they touched at, not fewer than 800 different ſpecies of plants. A number, very far beyond what had been imported, by any individual into <hi>England</hi> before.</p>
               <p>Dr. SLOANE returned from his voyage on the 29th of May 1689; and, fixing in <hi>London,</hi> ſoon became eminent. He was choſen phyſician to Chriſt's Hoſpital, in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0179600402:77"/>
1694. In the preceding year, he had been elected ſecretary to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and had revived the publication of the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Tranſactions,</hi> which had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the year 1687. This office he held till 1712, and was then ſucceeded by Dr. HALLEY.</p>
               <p>In 1695, Dr. SLOANE married <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> daughter of Alderman <hi>Langley,</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> She died in 1724. She brought him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a ſon, and daughter, who died young, two other daughters, who ſurvived, and were advantageouſly married; the eldeſt to <hi>George Stanley,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of the county of <hi>Hants;</hi> and the younger to Lord <hi>Cadogan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was about this time that he became an active member of the college, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the plan of a diſpenſary for the poor; which was at length carried into effect. The feuds excited on this occaſion gave riſe to the celebrated ſatire from Dr. GARTH.</p>
               <p>It was not till the year 1696 that Dr. SLOANE publiſhed the <hi>Prodromus</hi> to his Hiſtory of <hi>Jamaica</hi> Plants, under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM QUAE IN
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0179600402:78"/>

               </p>
               <p>This volume, intrinſically valuable as it is, my yet be conſidered as only the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menclature, or ſyſtematic index to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent work. The arrangement of the ſubject (and which was ſtrictly followed in "The Hiſtory,") is nearly that of Mr. RAY; vegetables being thrown into twenty-five large natural claſſes, or families. Among botaniſts of that time, generical characters had not attained any remarkable preciſion; and SLOANE, like PLUKENET, was little farther anxious, than to refer his new plants to ſome genus already eſtabliſhed, without a minute attention to the parts of fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, farther than as they formed part of the character drawn from habit: yet with this defect, the figures and deſcriptions of SLOANE proved ſufficiently accurate to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0179600402:79"/>
his ſucceſſors to refer almoſt all his ſpecies, to the appropriate places in the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the preſent day.</p>
               <p>By this neglect of conſtructing <hi>genera,</hi> SLOANE nevertheleſs threw into the hands of PLUMIER the grateful opportunity which he embraced, of naming the plants of his inveſtigations after celebrated botaniſts. In juſtice, however, to PLUMIER, it has been before obſerved, that he was not parſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in the diſtribution of theſe favours, to the merit of <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is worthy of obſervation, that among theſe claſſes, there are only two plants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Umbelliferous</hi> tribe, and but one genus of the <hi>Aſperifoliae,</hi> namely, the <hi>Heliotropium.</hi> The ferns, on the other hand, are very numerous all over the <hi>Weſt India</hi> iſlands. SLOANE has above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſpecies; and PLUMIER, a few years afterwards, detected many more.</p>
               <p>In this volume, however ſmall in bulk, yet vaſt in labour, there is a circumſtance much to the credit of SLOANE, which muſt be obvious to every intelligent naturaliſt. It is the care which the author has taken to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0179600402:80"/>
conſult every poſſible reſource, in order to diſcriminate his plants, and avoid an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary multiplication of ſpecies, by deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as new, which was before known. So numerous a ſet of ſynonyms had never been inſerted in any local catalogue; and SLOANE greatly enhanced its value, by a moſt commendable addition; having, with incredible labour, referred to every traveller of note for all the vegetables renowned for utility in medicine, arts, or oeconomy. In this inſtance, it is much to be regretted that ſo praiſe-worthy an example has not been more frequently imitated by ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing botaniſts.</p>
               <p>Before I diſmiſs this volume, I muſt mention an inſtance of the liberality of its author, in allowing Mr. RAY the free uſe of his manuſcripts of the <hi>Jamaica</hi> plants, on the publication of the third volume of his "Hiſtory," in 1704. Accordingly, we find all SLOANE's new plants, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions at large, inſerted in that work. He alſo communicated a liſt of <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants, which he had obſerved ſpontaneouſly growing in <hi>Jamaica.</hi> This was printed in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0179600402:81"/>
the ſecond edition of the <hi>Synopſis,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by DILLENIUS in the third.</p>
               <p>Dr. SLOANE began early to form a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum, and it was, by the collections made in his voyage, become conſiderable; but the aera of its celebrity was not till 1702, when it received the augmentation of Mr. COUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEN's valuable ſtores. United by ſimilar taſte, Dr. SLOANE had formed, with this gentleman, an early and ſtrict friendſhip; and a perpetual interchange of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and good offices, had ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; of which Sir <hi>Hans</hi> himſelf bears public teſtimony in his writings. It is not poſſible, at this time, to aſcertain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Mr. COURTEN's collection; but it is ſufficiently certain that it was very ample: the acquiſition of it added new ardour and diligence to our naturaliſt, in the augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it. He has himſelf exhibited a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtatement of the contents of his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum, twenty-two years after its enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the above-mentioned collection. By this it appears, that the ſubjects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hiſtory alone, excluſive of two hundred volumes of preſerved plants, amounted to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0179600402:82"/>
more than 26,200 articles. They were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards augmented to upwards of 30,600; as may be ſeen by "A General View of the Contents," publiſhed a year before his death.—And here I cannot but obſerve, that the curious are under ſingular obligation to the author of the article COURTEN, in the fourth volume of the new edition of the <hi>Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Britannica,</hi> who has, with great labour, brought to light ſo many intereſting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs relating to Mr. COURTEN, and his family. His truly laborious reſearches have done equal juſtice to that gentleman, and to Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, by reſcuing the hiſtory of their connexion from great miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Hence we learn, that Dr. SLOANE, as executor to his friend, ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the acceſſion of Mr. COURTEN's muſeum <hi>at a dear rate,</hi> as had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the preceding edition, obtained it at a price greatly under its original, and real value.</p>

               <p>IN the year 1701, Dr. SLOANE was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated doctor of phyſic at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and was aſſociated member of ſeveral aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies on the continent. In 1707, he publiſhed the firſt volume of his hiſtory, under the following title:</p>
               <p>"A VOYAGE to the Iſlands <hi>Madeira, Barbadoes, Nevis, St. Chriſtopher's,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica;</hi> with the Natural Hiſtory of the Herbs and Trees, four-footed Beaſts, Fiſhes, Birds, Inſects, Reptiles, &amp;c. To
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0179600402:84"/>
which is prefixed an Introduction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is an Account of the Inhabitants, Air, Waters, Diſeaſes, Trade, &amp;c. of that Place; with ſome Relations concerning the neighbouring Continent and Iſlands of America." Vol. i. 1707. fol. pp. 254. tab. 156.</p>
               <p>This volume is dedicated to the queen. The introduction contains 154 pages, and is replete with matter of an intereſting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and evidently diſplays the great pains the author took to collect materials for this work. It comprehends a general account of the diſcovery of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and of the iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> in particular: the geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, the climate, and ſoil; food, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and economy of the various inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: deſcription of a tour the author made to various parts of the country, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the ruins of <hi>Sevilla,</hi> with an account of the church built by <hi>Peter Martyr:</hi> a liſt of more than fifty European vegetables, principally of the culinary tribe, cultivated in the gardens of <hi>Jamaica.</hi> He concludes with an hiſtory of the diſeaſes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of many caſes which came under his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0179600402:85"/>
own obſervation. Then follows the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the voyage; with ample deſcriptions of the marine animals obſerved in the courſe of it: the plants obſerved at <hi>Madeira,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of which are figured in the work itſelf: obſervations of the like kind made at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes.</hi> The remainder of the volume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a methodical arrangement, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, of all the ſubmarine, and herba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous plants, natives of the iſland; amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 550 and upwards. Very few ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms are here introduced; but references, in general, made to the copious collection of them in his "Catalogue." To each plant the author has ſubjoined, from medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal authors, and from travellers, the moſt ample account of their ſeveral uſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond volume</hi> was not publiſhed till the year 1725, and was dedicated to the king. The reaſons of this delay are aſſigned in the introduction, and were, principally, the care, the arrangement, and deſcription of his muſeum. The acceſſion of Mr. COURTEN's collection has been remarked above; and that of PETIVER, in 1718, gave Sir <hi>Hans</hi> much employment. PETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0179600402:86"/>
had amaſſed a greater quantity of the productions of nature, than any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: but he had not preſerved them with a care equal to the zeal with which he acquired them; and it demanded extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diligence to recover them from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they had ſuſtained. It is in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to this volume that Sir <hi>Hans</hi> gives a general inventory of his Library, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum, as it ſtood in the year 1725, which has been noticed before; and, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which with later eſtimates, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears how greatly he increaſed it after that time.</p>
               <p>This ſecond volume comprehends five hundred pages, and completes the vegetable part, and the animal kingdom. The new plants are nearly all figured. The plates are continued to the number of 274. The laſt forty belong to the animals, of which, ſome of all the claſſes, the <hi>Mammalia</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, are here exhibited.</p>
               <p>To the curious botaniſt, it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that out of 800 vegetables, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in theſe volumes, above 100 are <hi>Ferns;</hi> and that of the others, more than 250 ſpecies are of the <hi>arboreſcent</hi> kind.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0179600402:87"/>
Subſequent voyagers have eſtabliſhed it as a fact, that in the warmer and intertropical regions, this latter claſs conſtitutes, in a general way, the third part of the vegetable productions of nature. Abundantly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of this takes place in temperate and cold climates.</p>
               <p>In theſe volumes Sir <hi>Hans</hi> has introduced all his quotations at length from the books of travels mentioned in the "Catalogue," to illuſtrate the various uſes of each vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. They exhibit a proof of the author's induſtry, which, I conceive, it is difficult to parallel in any other work. The tables, which were principally engraved by <hi>Vander Gucht,</hi> although on a large ſcale, yet hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſadvantage of being done from dried ſpecimens, want thoſe natural atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes which grace more modern perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. In this volume, Sir <hi>Hans</hi> takes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occaſions to defend himſelf from the ſtrictures of PLUKENET; and, in his turn, criticiſes that author, though in a language much leſs cenſurable than that of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The voyage of Dr. SLOANE was produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of much ſubſequent benefit to ſcience,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0179600402:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by exciting an emulation, both in <hi>Britain</hi> and on the continent. Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> RAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON, upon viewing his ſplendid collection, ſent <hi>James</hi> HARLOW, a ſkilful gardener, to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> who returned with a ſhip al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt laden with plants, in a vegetating ſtate; and with a great number of dried ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens. Of the latter, SLOANE had all ſuch as were new, before he publiſhed his firſt volume. Many of the living plants ſucceeded in the garden of Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> at <hi>Moyra,</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and many were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into the garden of the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> at <hi>Fulham;</hi> Dr. UVEDALE's, at <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field;</hi> the <hi>Chelſea</hi> Garden; and eſpecially into that of her Grace the <hi>Ducheſs</hi> of BEAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORT, at <hi>Badminton,</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire:</hi> the botanic gardens of <hi>Amſterdam, Leyden, Leipſic,</hi> and <hi>Upſal,</hi> ſhared theſe rarities. TOURNEFORT ſent Dr. GUNDELSCHEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER, his aſſociate in his oriental journey, into <hi>England,</hi> to view SLOANE's plants; and this gave occaſion to PLUMIER's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into the <hi>Caribbee</hi> Iſlands.</p>
               <p>Dr. SLOANE entered very early into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Mr. RAY. His firſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

In 1719, Sir <hi>Hans</hi> was elected Preſident of the College of Phyſicians, which ſtation he held ſixteen years, and during that time he gave ſignal proofs of his zeal for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of that body.</p>
               <p>On purchaſing the manor of <hi>Chelſea,</hi> he gave the fee ſimple of the <hi>Botanial Garden</hi> to the Company of Apothecaries, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which will more properly be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in a ſubſequent part of this work.</p>
               <p>On the death of Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> NEWTON, in 1727, Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE was advanced to the preſidency of the Royal Society of <hi>London,</hi> the intereſt of which no man had ever more uniformly promoted. He made the Society a preſent of 100 guineas, and a buſt of the founder, King <hi>Charles</hi> II. Thus, in the zenith of proſperity, he preſided, at the ſame time, over the two moſt illuſtrious ſcientific bodies in the kingdom: and, while he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the reſpective duties of each ſtation, with credit and honour, he alſo enjoyed the moſt extenſive and dignified employment as a phyſician. He occupied theſe important ſtations from the year 1719 to 1733, when he reſigned the preſidency of the College of Phyſicians; and, in 1740, at the age of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0179600402:91"/>
fourſcore, that of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> having formed the reſolution of withdrawing from the buſtle of life into retirement at <hi>Chelſea.</hi> In 1741, he removed his Library, and Muſeum; and, on the 12th of May, fixed at his new manſion, where, occaſionally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by his friends, and by all men of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from abroad, he paſſed in ſerenity, and in the conſtant exerciſe of benevolence, the laſt twelve years of his life, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Jan. 11, 1752, O.S.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE was tall, and well made in his perſon; eaſy, polite, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in his manners; ſprightly in his converſation; and obliging to all. To fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners he was extremely courteous, and ready to ſhew and explain his curioſities to all who gave him timely notice of their viſit. He kept an open table once a week for his learned friends, particularly thoſe of the Royal Society. In the aggregation of his vaſt collection of books, he is ſaid to have ſent his duplicates, either to the Royal College of Phyſicians, or to the Bodleian Library.</p>
               <p>He was governor of almoſt every hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0179600402:92"/>
in <hi>London;</hi> and to each, after having given an hundred pounds in his life-time, he left a more conſiderable legacy at his death. He was ever a benefactor to the poor, who felt the conſequences of his death ſeverely. He was zealous in promoting the eſtabliſhment of the colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> in 1732; and formed, himſelf, the plan for bringing up the children in the Foundling Hoſpital, in 1739.</p>
               <p>In the exerciſe of his function as a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, he is ſaid to have been remarkable for the certainty of his prognoſtics; and the hand of the anatomiſt verified, in a ſignal manner, the truth of his predictions, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeat of diſeaſes. By his practice, he not only confirmed the efficacy of the <hi>Peruvian Bark</hi> in intermittents, but extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its uſe in fevers of other denominations, in nervous diſorders, and in gangrenes and hemorrhages. The ſanction he gave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation, by performing that operation on ſome of the royal family, encouraged, and much accelerated its progreſs throughout the kingdom. His ointment for the <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coma</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0179600402:93"/>
has not yet loſt its credit with many reputable names in phyſic.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſſed of affluence, entirely the reward of his own merit, Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, through a long life, every ſatisfaction that ſcience could beſtow; and, in the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Muſeum,</hi> has not only erected the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt monument to his own fame, but a temple alſo to the culture of learning and of ſcience, which will tranſmit his dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to future ages, as a ſignal inſtance of the munificence of a private individual.</p>
               <p>That the liſt of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE's wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings may be complete, I ſhall, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with my general plan in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, recite thoſe papers which were printed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions.</hi> Many of theſe convey ſuch intereſting lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary information, and abound with ſuch facts and obſervations, as will long give them a value, with all who remember the eminent abilities and ſervices of the author, and have a reliſh for the like reſearches.</p>

All new objects of curioſity; all new books, at home and abroad; new diſcoveries throughout all nature, inceſſantly offered themſelves; and thus, not only tended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the prejudices that too ſtrongly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt the ſtudies of nature in that age, but, in the event, excited a paſſion in the public, which was ſo ſucceſsfully exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in improving, not natural hiſtory alone, but real and uſeful ſcience at large, that it will not be conſidered as an exaggerated encomium to aſſert, that more effectual advancement was made by the influence of this illuſtrious body in one century, than had before taken place from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt ages.

               <head>CHELSEA GARDEN.</head>
               <p>I proceed further to obſerve, that, among the aſſiſtances which the ſcience has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from public bodies of men, muſt be mentioned alſo that which ſprung from the Phyſic Garden, founded by the Company of Apothecaries at <hi>Chelſea;</hi> an inſtitution which reflected the higheſt honour on that reſpectable ſociety. This took place in the year 1673, although the inſcription over the entrance imports, that the Garden was not effectually conſtructed till the year 1686.</p>
               <p>From the time of JOHNSON, the editor of GERARD, a cuſtom had prevailed among the <hi>London</hi> Apothecaries to form a ſociety
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0179600402:107"/>
each ſummer, and make excurſions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate plants. The <hi>Itinera,</hi> publiſhed by JOHNSON, may be conſidered as the fruit of ſuch expeditions in his day. But they had been diſcontinued, as I apprehend, for many years. After the foundation of the Garden, this laudable practice was revived, and the aſſociations fixed to ſtated periods, and put under regulations; the herborizings being now diſtinguiſhed into private and general. The firſt, intended to excite a taſte for botany among the apprentices of the Company, begin on the ſecond Tueſday of April, and are held monthly, on the ſame day, till September incluſively, in ſome of the villages in the immediate neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>London.</hi> At the end of the ſeaſon, the premium of a copy of RAY's <hi>Synopſis,</hi> (ſince changed for Mr. HUDSON's <hi>Flora Anglica</hi>) is preſented to the young man who has been the moſt ſucceſsful in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and inveſtigating the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of plants. The general herborization is annual only, in July; when the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator, and others of the Court of Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, belonging to the Company, make an excurſion to a conſiderable diſtance from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0179600402:108"/>
the city, collect the ſcarce plants, and dine together near <hi>London;</hi> on which occaſion they are frequently accompanied by other gentlemen, who are fond of the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.</p>
               <p>This inſtitution at <hi>Chelſea</hi> was rendered more ſtable, and received permanency, from the liberality of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE; who, ſoon after his purchaſe of the manor, in 1721, gave the freehold of the ground, near four acres, to the Company, on condition that the demonſtrator ſhould, in the name of the Company, deliver annually to the <hi>Royal Society</hi> fifty new plants, till the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould amount to 2000, all ſpecifically different from each other; the liſt of which was publiſhed yearly, in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions.</hi> The firſt was printed in the year 1722, and the catalogues have been continued till the year 1773, at which time the number 2550 was completed. Theſe ſpecimens are duly preſerved in the archives of the Society, for the inſpection of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>Under excellent ſuperintendants, <hi>Chelſea Garden</hi> has flouriſhed; having been excelled, perhaps, by no public inſtitution of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0179600402:109"/>
kind in <hi>Europe,</hi> for the number of curious exotics it contains. Of this, the Dictionary, and Figures of the late Mr. MILLER, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſufficient proofs. The advantages, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of this inſtitution are obvious; and even Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his obligations to it in the early part of his life.</p>
               <p>In juſtice to the memory of thoſe who have eminently filled the place of lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, and demonſtrators, in the <hi>Chelſea Garden,</hi> I recite their names, from the time of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE's donation; not being able to aſcend above that period. <table>

Mr. EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LYN, both by his writings, and example, encouraged the ſame taſte. He cultivated a garden and plantations at <hi>Saye's-Court,</hi> near <hi>Deptford;</hi> and his <hi>Sylva</hi> remains a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his learning, and patriotic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which cannot ſoon be ſuperſeded.</p>

Dr. UVEDALE, of <hi>Enfield;</hi> of Mr. DU BOIS, an <hi>Eaſt India</hi> merchant; of Mr. COURTEN, and others, were of the firſt notice; and afforded much aſſiſtance to the labours of RAY, PLUKENET, and PETIVER.

               <head>BISHOP COMPTON.</head>
               <p>Among thoſe I have juſt enumerated, Dr. <hi>Henry</hi> COMPTON, Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> claims peculiar notice; ſince we learn from Mr. RAY, and PLUKENET, that he joined to his taſte for gardening, a real and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific knowledge of plants; an attainment not uſual among the great, in thoſe days.</p>
               <p>This eminent prelate, ſo diſtinguiſhed for his zeal in the cauſe of Proteſtantiſm, and for the active part he took in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Revolution, was born in the year 1632. He was entered a nobleman of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0179600402:113"/>
Queen's College, <hi>Oxford,</hi> in 1649, where he continued about three years; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards travelled abroad. After the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he entered into the army; but very ſoon quitted it for the church. In the year 1666, he became Rector of <hi>Cottenham,</hi> in <hi>Cambridgeſhire;</hi> and, after poſſeſſing various emoluments in the church, was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the year 1674; and the year after, tranſlated to the See of <hi>London,</hi> which he held to the time of his death, in the year 1713, at the age of 81.</p>
               <p>In his retirement at <hi>Fulham,</hi> Biſhop COMPTON amply gratified himſelf in his favourite amuſement. The circumſtances of the times, above mentioned, aided by his own zeal, and a reſidence of thirty-eight years on the ſame See, enabled him, finally, to collect a greater variety of Green-houſe rarities, and to plant a greater variety of hardy Exotic Trees, and Shrubs, than had been ſeen in any garden before in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This repoſitory was ever open to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the curious and ſcientific; and we find RAY, PETIVER, and PLUKENET, in numerous inſtances, acknowledging the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0179600402:114"/>
aſſiſtances they received from the free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of rare and new plants out of the garden at <hi>Fulham.</hi> Many of PLUKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET's figures were engraved from ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens out of the Biſhop's garden; and ſome from a book of drawings in his poſſeſſion, quoted under the name of <hi>Codex Comptoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis.</hi>

DOODY, the contemporary and friend of RAY, PLUKENET, and SLOANE, who all hear teſtimony to his merit. I regret the want of more information relating to this aſſiduous man; of whom I can only ſay, that he was born in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> was an apothecary in <hi>London,</hi> and a fellow of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi> He was choſen ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and demonſtrator of the Garden at <hi>Chelſea;</hi> an office he held for ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, which took place in 1706.</p>
               <p>As Mr. DOODY lived in <hi>London,</hi> and there is room to believe he was in very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable buſineſs, his excurſions could not ordinarily extend far from that city. In its neighbourhood, his diligence was beyond any other example. He ſtruck out a new path in botany, by leading to the ſtudy of that tribe, which comprehended the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect plants, now called the <hi>Cryptogamia</hi> claſs. In this branch he made the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous diſcoveries of any man in that age, and in the knowledge of it ſtood clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled. The early editions of RAY's <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> were much amplified by his labours; and he is repreſented by Mr. RAY, as a man
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0179600402:116"/>
of uncommon ſagacity in diſcovering and diſcriminating plants in general. The learned ſucceſſor of <hi>Tournefort,</hi> M. JUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIEU, ſpeaks of him as <hi>inter Pharmacopoeos Londinenſes ſui temporis Coryphaeus.</hi> In truth, he was the DILLENIUS of his time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>EDWARD</hi> LLHWYD was one of the moſt learned and celebrated antiquaries of the laſt century, and a ſkilful naturaliſt. According to Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> he was the ſon of <hi>Edward</hi> LLHWYD, or <hi>Lloyd,</hi> of <hi>Kidwell,</hi> in <hi>Carmarthenſhire;</hi> but, as <hi>Boyer</hi> relates, of <hi>Charles Llhwyd,</hi> of <hi>Lanvordia,</hi> in <hi>Salop,</hi> Eſq. He was born in 1670, and became a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Jeſus College</hi> in 1687, of which Dr. PLOT was a member, and under whom Mr. LLHWYD was in a great meaſure edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0179600402:118"/>
On the reſignation of Dr. PLOT, he ſucceeded him as keeper of the <hi>Aſhmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laean</hi> Muſeum, about 1690. He travelled repeatedly all over <hi>Wales;</hi> went through the North of <hi>Scotland;</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which kingdom he ſeems to have made ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable abode. He ſpent ſome time in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> and in <hi>Britany</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in ſearch of antiquities, and materials to carry on the extenſive deſigns he had formed.</p>
               <p>In all theſe journies he was conſtantly attentive to the objects of natural hiſtory, foſſils, plants, and any remarkable phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena of nature. Such of his remarks as are publiſhed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> are full of curious and new informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on theſe ſubjects. His knowledge of the plants of his own country, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe of <hi>Wales,</hi> juſtly entitles him to remembrance in theſe pages, although he was not profeſſedly an author on the ſubject of them.</p>
               <p>LLHWYD firſt brought to light ſeveral of the rare plants of <hi>Wales;</hi> many of which, till of late years, were conſidered as natives of no other part of Britain. He diſcovered
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0179600402:119"/>
ſeveral very ſcarce ſpecies in <hi>Cornwall:</hi> all theſe he communicated to Mr. RAY, who inſerted them in the editions of his <hi>Synopſis,</hi> with due acknowledgments. After having made very large collections for the antiquities of <hi>Wales,</hi> and formed great deſigns in litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he died before he could digeſt them into order for publication, in July 1709.</p>
               <p>Excluſive of large communications, made to Biſhop GIBSON's edition of <hi>Camden,</hi> on the antiquities of <hi>Wales,</hi> he formed, from the fruit of his own inveſtigations, the <hi>Liſt of Plants</hi> ſubjoined to the account of that country.</p>
               <p>He publiſhed, "LITHOPHYLACII BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANNICI ICHNOGRAPHIA." 1699. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>cum tab.</hi> 25. This work, which is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical catalogue of the figured foſſils of the <hi>Aſhmolean</hi> Muſeum, conſiſting of 1766 articles, was printed at the expence of Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> NEWTON, Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, and a few others of his learned friends. As only 120 copies were printed, a new edition of it was publiſhed in 1760 by Mr. <hi>Huddesford;</hi> to which were annexed ſeveral letters from Mr. LLHWYD to his learned friends, on the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0179600402:120"/>
ſubject of Foſſils; his <hi>Praelectio de Stellis Marinis Oceani Britannici, et Aſteriarum, Entrochorum, et Encrinorum Origine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Mr. RAY's correſpondence, we meet with thirteen letters, written by LLHWYD; all, except one, bearing date in 1690, and the four ſubſequent years. They run chiefly on the ſubject of Foſſils. In October 1692, he informs Mr. RAY, that he was employed in drawing up a Catalogue of Mr. ASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOLE's <hi>Legacy</hi> of Books, Medals, and Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In the liſt of his printed works, we find <hi>Catalogus Librorum Manuſcriptorum in Muſeo Aſhmoleano,</hi> in 10 ſheets, folio, without date. In 1707, he publiſhed "AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHAEOLOGIA BRITANNICA," fol. Vol. I. <hi>Gloſſography.</hi> A work by which he will long be remembered among the lovers of antiquity.</p>
               <p>From private information, I have learned that Mr. LLHWYD left a very conſiderable library, a large collection of manuſcripts and ſpecimens; that in the year 1728, theſe were all in the cuſtody of Dr. FOWLKES, of <hi>Lhanher,</hi> who died ſoon after that time. They were undiſpoſed of ten years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;

for their knowledge in botany, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out publiſhing profeſſedly on this ſubject, <hi>Thomas</hi> LAWSON, by whoſe diſcoveries the <hi>Engliſh Flora</hi> was enlarged, muſt not be forgotten.</p>
               <p>Of Mr. LAWSON I can only collect, that he lived at <hi>Great Strickland,</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland,</hi> at the time he tranſmitted to Mr. RAY "A Catalogue of the Rare Plants of the North of <hi>England;</hi>" which is printed in the "Philoſophical Letters," p. 213. This liſt clearly evinces, that the author muſt have paid great attention to his ſubject; and, in fact, Mr. LAWSON firſt introduced ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants into notice. It is to him that we owe the botanical part of ROBIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON's "Eſſay on the Natural Hiſtory of <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The very frequent mention of his name in the writings of Mr. RAY, and the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the <hi>Catalogue of Rare Plants,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by him at ſo early a period, in the North of <hi>England,</hi> ſufficiently confirm the character that eminent naturaliſt gives him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"of a diligent, induſtrious, and ſkilful botaniſt."</q> It appears that he travelled
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0179600402:125"/>
into various parts of <hi>England;</hi> ſince he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites plants collected by him on <hi>Saliſbury</hi> Plain; and, if I miſtake not, he made an excurſion into the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conjecture that he ſurvived Mr. RAY ſeveral years: but he was not living at the publication of the third edition of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſis Stirpium,</hi> although he left papers, of which DILLENIUS availed himſelf on that occaſion.</p>

               <p>Theſe letters, and the publications of Dr. ROBINSON, in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,</hi> prove him to have been a man well acquainted with various parts of learning; to which he added alſo an intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of natural hiſtory, and in which he muſt have been very early initiated; ſince RAY, in the Prefaces to his <hi>Hiſtoria Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum,</hi> in 1686, acknowledges, in ſtrong terms, his obligations to him, for his care and aſſiduity in correcting and enriching his work; adding, that he had exerted himſelf with a zeal that could not have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, had the work been entirely his own.</p>

                  <hi>SAMUEL</hi> DALE, of <hi>Braintree,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the friend and neighbour of Mr. RAY, eminent for his knowledge of botany; but better known as a writer on the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part of the ſcience, its application to the purpoſes of phyſic. I am not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with any anecdotes concerning this reſpectable writer, further than, that he practiſed as an apothecary at <hi>Braintree,</hi> until about the year 1730; about which time he became a Licentiate of the College of Phyſicians, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At this time, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, he ſettled at <hi>Bocking,</hi> and practiſed as a phyſician until his deceaſe, June 6th
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0179600402:130"/>
1739, in the eightieth year of his age. He was buried in the Diſſenter's burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground at <hi>Bocking.</hi> A print of him may be ſeen before the third edition of his <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macologia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He publiſhed PHARMACOLOGIA, ſ. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuductio ad Materiam Medicam.</hi> It was firſt printed in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, 1693, with the ſanction of the College of Phyſicians, and we find four editions of it printed abroad. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed at London in 1705 and 1710, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, and a third time in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, in 1737, pp. 460; which edition is much improved and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. The arrangement of the work is that of RAY; and, to each chapter, throughout the vegetable kingdom, he has prefixed the characters of the genus, from the <hi>Methodus Emendata</hi> of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. He has moreover, with great labour, conſtructed a <hi>Syllabus,</hi> or ſynoptical view of all the articles under each ſection or claſs, on a more amplified plan, than that of RAY.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Materia Medica</hi> of DALE, in its firſt edition, may be ſaid to have been one of the earlieſt rational books on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0179600402:131"/>
In an interval of more than forty years, between the firſt and laſt editions, much of that credulity which had obtained, reſpecting the powers of ſimples, among the writers of the laſt century, had abated. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral excellent publications had taken place abroad, which, aided by improvements at home, enabled DALE to ſelect better materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and give his laſt edition the importance of a new work. Scarcely in any author is there a more copious collection of ſynonyms, a circumſtance which, independent of much other intriſic worth, will long continue the uſe of the book, with thoſe who wiſh to purſue the hiſtory of any article through all former writers on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>In 1730, Mr. DALE publiſhed, "The ANTIQUITILS of HARWICH and DOVER COURT," in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 464. tab. 14. writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Silas</hi> TAYLOR, <hi>Gent.</hi> about the year 1676, with large notes, amounting to much the greater part of the book. Howſoever reſpectable our author may appear as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary in this volume, he is equally ſo as a naturaliſt, in general. His Hiſtory of the Figured Foſſils of the Cliff is very exact,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0179600402:132"/>
and copious; and the view he has given, in a ſhort compaſs, of the various opinions relating to the origin of theſe bodies, as held by the writers of the laſt, and the beginning of the preſent century, is very ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Synopſis</hi> of the animals and vegetables of the neighbouring ſea and coaſt, proves his intimate and critical knowledge of his ſubjects; and being embelliſhed with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good copper-plates, renders his book a real acquiſition to ſcience.</p>
               <p>It is highly probable, that, from their vicinity to each other, DALE owed to Mr. RAY, his attachment to natural hiſtory, and the great proficiency he ſo early made in that ſtudy. We find Mr. RAY acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his aſſiſtance in collecting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricating the ſynonyms of plants, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing errors, and ſupplying omiſſions, for his <hi>Hiſtoria Plantarum,</hi> of which the <hi>imprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> bears date 1685, when DALE could not be more than 26 years old.</p>
               <p>DALE was the author of ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications to the Royal Society, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0179600402:133"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>RICHARD</hi> BRADLEY, a popular writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on Gardening and Agriculture, in the early part of this century, was one of the firſt who treated theſe ſubjects in a philoſophical manner; and, as he poſſeſſed conſiderable botanical knowledge, is entitled to a place in theſe Anecdotes. He firſt made himſelf known to the public by two papers, printed in the xxixth Volume of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions.</hi> One "on the Motion of the Sap in Vegetables<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. xxix. p. 486.</note>:" the other, "on the quick Growth of Mouldineſs on Melons<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 490.</note>." He became a Fellow of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0179600402:137"/>
was choſen Profeſſor of Botany in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in 1724. BRADLEY was the author of more than twenty ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate publications; chiefly on Gardening and Agriculture, publiſhed between the years 1716 and 1730.</p>
               <p>His "New Improvement of Planting and Gardening, both Philoſophical and Practical," 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, 1717, went through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated impreſſions; as did his Gentleman's "and Gardener's Kalendar," (which was the fourth part of the preceding book) both at home, and in tranſlations abroad. His "Philoſophical Account of the Works of Nature," 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1721, was a popular, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, and entertaining work, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in repute ſeveral years. The ſame may be ſaid of his "General Treatiſe of Huſbandry and Gardening," 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2 Vol. 1726; and of his "Practical Diſcourſes concerning the four Elements, as they relate to the Growth of Plants." 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1727. His "<hi>Dictionarium Botanicum.</hi>" 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1728, was, I believe, the firſt attempt of the kind in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. BRADLEY was not eminent for any diſcoveries relating to the indigenous plants
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0179600402:138"/>
of <hi>England;</hi> but exotic botany was indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for an undertaking, which there is reaſon to regret he was not enabled to purſue and perfect. I mean his book on <hi>Succulent Plants.</hi> As this tribe is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being advantageouſly preſerved in a <hi>Hortus Siccus,</hi> there is no part of botany that calls more eſſentially for a ſeparate publication. His work bears the following title, "HISTORIA PLANTARUM SUCCU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENTARUM, <hi>complectens haſce inſequentes Plantas, Aloen ſcilicet, Ficoiden, Cereos, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locardium, aliaſque ejus generis quae in Horto ſicco coli non poſſunt, ſecundum Prototypum puta naturam in tabellis aeneis inſculptas, earum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Deſcriptiones huc accedunt et Cultura.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1716. t. 50. It was publiſhed in <hi>Decads,</hi> at different times, between the years 1716 and 1727; of which only five were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted. The whole was republiſhed in 1734. The deſcriptions are in Latin and Engliſh, and the figures extremely well done in the ſtile of the time. It preſerves its value, as being cited by LINNAEUS, and as containing ſome plants not figured in any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0179600402:139"/>
A ſpecies of <hi>Sedum</hi> is the only indigenous plant contained in it.</p>
               <p>BRADLEY gave a courſe of Lectures on the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1729, which he publiſhed in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding year. He died at the latter end of 1732.</p>
               <p>Although BRADLEY's writings do not abound in new diſcoveries, yet they are not deſtitute of intereſting knowledge, collected from contemporary gardeners, and from books. He was an advocate for the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſap, and made ſeveral new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the ſexes of plants, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the production of hybrid ſpecies, by which he added ſtrength to that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. He wrote inſtructively on the gems of trees; on bulbs; on grafting; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, on the methods of producing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated and double flowers.</p>
               <p>On the whole, BRADLEY's writings, coinciding with the growing taſte for gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening, the introduction of exotics, and improvements in huſbandry, contributed to excite a more philoſophical view of theſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0179600402:140"/>
arts, and diffuſe a general and popular knowledge of them throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>The induſtry and talents of BRADLEY were not mean; and though unadorned by learning, were ſufficient to have ſecured to him, that reputable degree of reſpect from poſterity, which it will ever juſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from him who fails to recommend ſuch qualifications, by integrity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of conduct. In theſe, unhappily, Mr. BRADLEY was deficient. We learn, from the account given of him by Mr. MARTYN, that he procured the profeſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a clandeſtine and fraudulent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and afterwards neglected to perform the duties of it. The Univerſity, nevertheleſs, allowed him to retain the nominal diſtinction of Profeſſor, and appointed Dr. MARTYN to give the lectures. Near the concluſion of his life, his conduct was ſo unbecoming, that it was in agitation to deprive him of this nominal title.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> BLAIR was a native of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and practiſed phyſic and ſurgery at <hi>Dundee;</hi> where he made himſelf firſt known as an anatomiſt, by the diſſection of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which died near that place, in 1706. He was a Nonjuror, and ſo far attached to the exiled family, as to have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the rebellion in 1715, as a ſuſpected perſon. He afterwards removed to <hi>London,</hi> where he recommended himſelf to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> by ſome Diſcourſes on the Sexes of Flowers. His ſtay in <hi>London</hi> was not long; he quitted it, and ſettled at <hi>Boſton,</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> where, if I miſtake not, he practiſed phyſic during the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his life. I am not able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the time of his deceaſe; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that it was ſoon after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Seventh <hi>Decad</hi> of his <hi>Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botanologia,</hi> in 1728.</p>
               <p>Dr. BLAIR's firſt publication was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled "Miſcellaneous Obſervations in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, Anatomy, Surgery, and Botanicks." 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, 1718. In the botanical part of this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0179600402:142"/>
work, he inſinuates ſome doubts relating to the method ſuggeſted by PETIVER, and others, of deducing the qualities of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, from the agreement in natural cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; and inſtances the <hi>Cynogloſſum,</hi> as tending to prove the fallacy of this rule. He relates ſeveral inſtances of the poiſonous effects of plants; and thinks the <hi>Echium Marinum</hi> (<hi>Pulmonaria Maritima</hi> Lin.) ſhould be ranked in the genus <hi>Cynogloſſum,</hi> ſince it poſſeſſes a narcotic power. He deſcribes, and figures, ſeveral of the more rare <hi>Britiſh</hi> plants, which he had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a tour made into <hi>Wales.</hi> e. g. The <hi>Rumex Digynus: Lobelia Dortmanna: Aliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Ranunculoides: Pyrola Rotundifolia: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemilla Alpina,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Dr. BLAIR's treatiſe, as far as I can find, was the firſt compleat work, at leaſt in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> language, written on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and the author ſhews himſelf well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, in general, with all the opinions, and arguments of authors, on the matter of each eſſay. The value of theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> muſt not be eſtimated by the meaſure of modern knowledge, though even at this day, they may be read by thoſe not criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally verſed in the ſubject, with inſtruction and improvement. A view of the ſeveral methods then invented, cannot be ſeen ſo connectedly exhibited in any other <hi>Engliſh</hi> author. Dr. BLAIR ſtrengthened the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in proof of the Sexes of Plants, by ſound reaſoning, and ſome new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His reaſons againſt MORLAND's opinion, of the entrance of the <hi>Farina</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Vaſculum ſeminale,</hi> and his refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lewenhoekian theory, have met with the ſanction of the moderns.

               <p>
                  <hi>WILLIAM</hi> SHERARD, or <hi>Sherwood,</hi> the ſon of <hi>George Sherwood,</hi> of <hi>Buſhby,</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> was born in 1659, and educated at Merchant Taylors' School, till he was entered at <hi>St. John's</hi> College, <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the year 1677. Of this college he became a Fellow, and took the degree of Bachelor of Law, Dec. 11, 1683. After this time, he accompanied <hi>Lord Viſcount Townſhevd</hi> in his travels; and diſcharged
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0179600402:149"/>
his truſt with ſo much reputation, that he was prevailed on to take the charge of <hi>Wriotheſly,</hi> grandſon of <hi>William,</hi> firſt <hi>Duke of</hi> BEDFORD; and made a ſecond tour to the continent, with equal ſatisfaction to the noble family who confided in him.</p>
               <p>He returned from this tour, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, about the year 1693; and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Mr. RAY a Catalogue of Plants, which he had remarked on Mount <hi>Jura, Saleve,</hi> and the neighbourhood of <hi>Geneva.</hi> This was publiſhed as a Supplement in RAY's "<hi>Sylloge Stirpium Europaearum.</hi>" About this time we find he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with his friend Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> RAWDON, at <hi>Moyra;</hi> of whom mention has been made in the article SLOANE.</p>
               <p>In travelling, SHERARD gratified his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite paſſion, and formed connections with the moſt celebrated characters on the continent, HERMAN, BOERHAAVE, and TOURNEFORT. He was very early ſkilled in <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany; and although his publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are few, there is no doubt that he had beſtowed great aſſiduity in the ſtudy of <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants. Need I allege any farther
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0179600402:150"/>
evidence, than the obligations, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which Mr. RAY acknowledges for aſſiſtance in his "Hiſtory of Plants." He travelled early into various parts of <hi>England,</hi> and was ever attentive to make diſcoveries. He made the tour of the Weſt as far as into <hi>Cornwall.</hi> He ſearched the iſland of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and communicated a Liſt of Plants to Mr. RAY, to be inſerted in the firſt edition of the <hi>Synopſis,</hi> printed in 1690.</p>
               <p>He is ſaid to have been the author of a book publiſhed under the name of <hi>Samuel</hi> WHARTON, "<hi>Schola Botanica; ſive, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus Plantarum quas ab aliquot Annis in Horto Regio Pariſienſi Studioſis indigitavit Joſ. Pet.</hi> TOURNEFORT." <hi>Amſt.</hi> 1689. 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It was reprinted in 1691, and 1699. If indeed SHERARD was the author of this book, he muſt have attended the lectures of TOURNE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORT three ſeveral ſeaſons. It contains a rude ſketch of TOURNEFORT's Method of Botany, exemplified in a large catalogue of plants; among which are innumerable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, ſome new ſpecies collected by TOURNEFORT himſelf in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0179600402:151"/>
Mountains, and others introduced by the care of M. FAGON.</p>
               <p>It is to SHERARD alſo, that the learned owe the publication of HERMAN's "<hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſus Batavus, continens plus centum Plantas affabre Aere inciſas, et Deſcriptionibus illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratas.</hi>" 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lugd. Bat.</hi> 1698. He wrote a preface to this work, in which he relates the difficulties he met with, in reducing the author's papers into method; and which contains an account of other works of HERMAN. This preface is dated from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> in April 1697; at which time, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, SHERARD was on his third tour, on the continent.</p>
               <p>In the year 1700, Mr. SHERARD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Royal Society a Method of making ſeveral <hi>China</hi> Varniſhes, which were ſent from the Jeſuits in <hi>China</hi> to the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> It was publiſhed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 262. Vol. xxii. p. 525. And the next year he communicated to the Society a paper from Dr. J. DEL PASSA, on the poiſonous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the <hi>Indian</hi> Varniſh on the human Skin; which on the naked Skin of Poultry
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0179600402:152"/>
proved quite harmleſs. How ſoon after this time he was engaged in any public employment, I cannot determine: but, in 1702, he was one of the commiſſioners for ſick and wounded ſeamen at <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> and, I believe, was ſoon after appointed conſul at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> a department, which, it is probable, his deſire of inveſtigating the plants of the Eaſt had no ſmall ſhare in inducing him to accept. But SHERARD's knowledge and taſte was not confined to the ſtudy of botany. Mr. MARTYN in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that, <q rend="inline">"in 1705, with <hi>Antonio</hi> PICENINI, he viſited the ſeven churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> In 1709 and 1716, he tranſcribed the <hi>Monumenta Teia,</hi> and cauſed the <hi>Sigean</hi> inſcription to be copied and ſent to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and the learned Dr. CHISHULL de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates his account of it to him."</q> He alſo ſent an account of the iſland raiſed near <hi>Santorini,</hi> in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> on the 12th of May, 1707; which was printed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 314. Vol. xxii. p. 67.</p>
               <p>During his reſidence at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> he had a country houſe at a place called <hi>Sede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">

It is not yet forgotten as the reſidence of SHERARD. In 1749, HASSELQUIST vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited this retreat, and viewed, with all the enthuſiaſm of a young botaniſt, the ſpot where <q rend="inline">"the regent of the botanic world,"</q> as he ſtiles him, ſpent his ſummers, and cultivated his garden. Here SHERARD collected ſpecimens of all the plants of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and began that famous <hi>Herbarium,</hi> which at length became the moſt extenſive that had ever been ſeen as the work of one man, ſince it is ſaid final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have contained 12,000 ſpecies. And here he is ſaid to have begun the much-celebrated <hi>Pinax,</hi> to which he continued to make acceſſions throughout his life. He returned into <hi>England,</hi> in 1718. Soon after which time, he had the degree of Doctor of Laws conferred upon him by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1721, Dr. SHERARD communicated to the Royal Society an Account of the Poiſon Wood Tree of <hi>New England,</hi> which he had received from Mr. MORE. It does not appear that the ſpecies had been aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till Dr. SHERARD pointed it out as

               <p>In this year he returned to the continent, and made the tour of <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Whilſt at <hi>Paris,</hi> he found VAIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANT in a declining ſtate of health; but, anxious to preſerve his papers from obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, VAILLANT had ſolicited BOER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAAVE to purchaſe, and to publiſh them. SHERARD negociated the buſineſs, and ſpent the greateſt part of the ſummer with BOERHAAVE, in reducing the manuſcripts into order. To SHERARD, therefore, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, the learned owe the <hi>Botanicon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſienſe,</hi> which was publiſhed in 1727. BOERHAAVE prefixed to this work a <hi>Latin</hi> letter, written by Dr. SHERARD, giving an account of this tranſaction; which is alſo more fully explained in the preface. It was in this tour, that, being in ſearch of plants in the <hi>Alps,</hi> he narrowly eſcaped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhot by a peaſant for a wolf.</p>
               <p>On his return, he brought over with him the celebrated DILLENIUS, with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0179600402:155"/>
whom he had before correſponded, and whom he had encouraged to proſecute his enquiries into the <hi>Cryptogamia</hi> claſs, and in publiſhing his <hi>Plantae Giſſenſes.</hi> SHERARD had himſelf been among the earlieſt in <hi>England,</hi> to promote attention to this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto neglected part of nature; and in this DILLENIUS had already excelled all who had written before him.</p>
               <p>Although Dr. SHERARD had acquired a conſiderable fortune in <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet he lived with the greateſt privacy in <hi>London,</hi> wholly immerſed in the ſtudy of natural hiſtory; except when he went to his brother's ſeat and fine garden at <hi>Eltham.</hi> Dr. DIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENIUS aſſiſted him in his chief employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the carrying on his <hi>Pinax,</hi> or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of all the names, which had been given by botanical writers to each plant; being a continuation of <hi>Caſpar</hi> BAUHINE's great plan.</p>
               <p>Dr. SHERARD was, in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the patron of Mr. <hi>Mark</hi> CATESBY; and himſelf affixed the <hi>Latin</hi> names to the plants of "The Natural Hiſtory of <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina.</hi>"</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0179600402:156"/>
He died Auguſt 12, 1728; and, by his will, gave three thouſand pounds, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a ſalary for a profeſſor of botany at <hi>Oxford,</hi> on condition, that Dr. DILLENIUS ſhould be choſen firſt profeſſor. He erected the edifice at the entrance of the garden, for the uſe of the profeſſor; and gave to this eſtabliſhment his botanical library, his <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barium,</hi> and the <hi>Pinax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. SHERARD was among the laſt of thoſe ornaments in <hi>England,</hi> of that aera which LINNAEUS calls <q rend="inline">"the golden age of botany."</q> Having from his earlieſt years a reliſh for the ſtudy of natural hiſtory, and in his youth acquired a knowledge of <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany, his repeated tours to the continent, and his long reſidence in the Eaſt, afforded ample ſcope for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; and the acquiſition of affluence, joined to his learning, and agreeable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rendered him, after his return home, a liberal and zealous patron of the ſcience, and of thoſe who cultivated it<note n="*" place="bottom">VAILLANT firſt devoted the name <hi>Sherardia</hi> to a new genus, which was afterwards aſſimilated with the <hi>Vervain.</hi> About the ſame time, DILLENIUS gave the like appellation, in his <hi>Flora Giſſenſis,</hi> to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> plant of the <hi>Stellated</hi> claſs, in the ſyſtem of RAY, which retains its diſtinction in the <hi>Tetrandrous</hi> claſs of LINNAEUS.</note>.</p>

                  <hi>James,</hi> the brother of <hi>William</hi> SHERARD, was born in 1666. He practiſed phyſic as an apothecary in <hi>London,</hi> and was early and ſtrongly attached to his brother's favourite purſuit. Having become eminent and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in his profeſſion, he cultivated, at his country ſeat, at <hi>Eltham,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> one of the richeſt gardens that <hi>England</hi> ever poſſeſſed. It was alſo the retirement of his brother, the conſul, after his return from <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and is immortalized by the pen of DILLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIUS. Mr. SHERARD is not known as an author; but his name frequently occurs in RAY's <hi>Synopſis,</hi> for his diſcoveries of rare <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants; of which he had great knowledge, as he is ſaid to have had of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hiſtory in general; and his zeal for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0179600402:158"/>
botany was ſingularly great. To theſe he added a reliſh for the elegant and polite arts; and particularly for muſic, in which he was eminently ſkilled.</p>
               <p>He inherited the bulk of his brother's fortune; and, in the latter part of his life, had the degree of Doctor of Phyſic confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him, if I miſtake not, by the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and was admitted a member of the College of Phyſicians.

               <p>AFTER SHERARD, I am led in chronological courſe, as well as by other aſſociations, to a character of the higheſt worth in botanical ſcience. That harmony of taſte, and co-operation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which firſt connected SHERARD and DILLENIUS, hath inſeparably united their names, as long as their works ſhall endure. DILLENIUS, though not an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> born, is gratefully naturalized by a nation,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0179600402:161"/>
to whoſe botanical fame he gave an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence it had not experienced from the time of RAY. It was no mean ſacrifice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his country, his friends, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, and his proſpects from a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is, at leaſt ſometimes, lucrative, that he might devote himſelf to the culture of ſcience, in a foreign land, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his views was moſt probably bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the precarious hope of a profeſſorſhip alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Jacob</hi> DILLENIUS<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a letter extant, written by DILLENIUS, in 1727, in which he tells his correſpondent, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I had once a mind to have ſpelled my name DILLEN, it being eaſier to pronounce; and to make my brother do the ſame: for my great grandfather ſpelled it ſo, and my great great grandfather DILL: but, conſidering that my name and my father's had been ſo often printed DILLENIUS, I have left it as it is."</q>
                  </note> was born at <hi>Darmſtadt,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the year 168<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. It appears that he had his education, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally at the univerſity of <hi>Gieſſen,</hi> a city of <hi>Upper Heſſe;</hi> and where, probably, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily had conſiderable intereſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions; ſince I find two of his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries of the ſame name, of whom, one was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0179600402:162"/>
a profeſſor of medicine, and dean of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of phyſic at that place; and the other, <hi>Poliater,</hi> or public phyſician; an office, I believe, not uncommon in <hi>Germany,</hi> though unknown here; and which DILLENIUS himſelf held in the ſame city. He was very early made a member of the <hi>Academia Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſorum Germaniae.</hi> He communicated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral papers to that ſociety, which were publiſhed in their <hi>Miſcellanea Curioſa.</hi> The earlieſt, that I find, was a Diſſertation, in the <hi>Third Century of Obſervations,</hi> about the year 1715, concerning the plants of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> which are naturalized in <hi>Europe.</hi> This is a ſubject which might again be taken up by a ſkilful hand, to great advantage. The reſult of obſervation, and communication on this matter, would unqueſtionably prove, that a far greater number of plants than we are aware of, which are now thought to be indigenous in <hi>Europe,</hi> were of exotic origin. Beſides the moſt obvious method, from the garden to the dunghill, and from thence to the field, amongſt a variety of other cauſes, the importation of grain has introduced a great number: the package of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0179600402:163"/>
and the clearing out of ſhips, have been the means of diſperſing many. The <hi>Engliſh Flora,</hi> as it now ſtands, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fewer, perhaps, than ſixty <hi>acknowledged</hi> ſpecies; and a critical examination would probably inveſtigate a much greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Fourth Century</hi> of the ſame work, we find a critical diſſertation on the <hi>(Cahve)</hi> coffee of the <hi>Arabians:</hi> and on <hi>European</hi> coffee, or ſuch as may be prepared from grain or pulſe. DILLENIUS gives the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his own preparations made with peaſe, beans, and kidney beans; but ſays, that from <hi>rye</hi> comes the neareſt to true coffee, and was with difficulty diſtinguiſhed from it.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Sixth Century,</hi> he has deſcribed and figured four ſpecies of dubious plants; three of the <hi>Spergula</hi> genus, now <hi>Arenariae;</hi> and a <hi>Veronica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Appendix to this <hi>Century,</hi> DIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENIUS gave the firſt ſpecimen of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate examination of ſome plants of the <hi>Cryptogamous</hi> claſs; which he afterwards purſued ſo greatly to the improvement of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0179600402:164"/>
botany. In this paper, DILLENIUS treats on the propagation of plants in general; but more particularly on that of the <hi>Ferns,</hi> or <hi>capillary</hi> plants; and of the <hi>Moſſes,</hi> which had hitherto been conſidered as deſtitute of flower and ſeed. He deſcribes the flowers of that genus, which he afterwards called <hi>Lichenaſtrum,</hi> and which was named by MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHELI, <hi>Jungermannia.</hi> He delineates two of the <hi>Chara</hi> genus; ſome of the <hi>Confervae;</hi> and ſeveral of the more perfect plants, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Chondrilla.</hi> He fixed the genus <hi>Radiola; Corrigiola,</hi> &amp;c. and particularly the <hi>Centunculus;</hi> and <hi>Cameraria,</hi> which was afterwards called <hi>Montia.</hi> To theſe he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins many curious obſervations on the uſe of the <hi>petals</hi> and <hi>ſtamina,</hi> all tending to confirm the doctrine of the <hi>ſexes</hi> of plants; obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the root of the <hi>Equiſetum;</hi> on the duſt of the <hi>Antherae,</hi> and on the different ſhape of that in the <hi>Orchis,</hi> which he ſays is conical; and of that in the <hi>Ophrys,</hi> which is round.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Ninth Century</hi> of the ſame work, he relates an experiment he made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0179600402:165"/>
the Opium which he prepared himſelf, from the poppy of <hi>European</hi> growth.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Eighth Century,</hi> he appears as a zoologiſt, in a paper on <hi>Leeches;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes two ſpecies of the <hi>Papilio</hi> genus.</p>
               <p>In 1719, he publiſhed his "Catalogue of Plants growing in the neighbourhood of <hi>Gieſſen;</hi>" a work which eſtabliſhed his character as one of the moſt accurate botaniſts of the age. It bears the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing title:</p>

               <p>It is dedicated to the heads of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Gieſſen;</hi> and contains the plants
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0179600402:166"/>
of the neighbourhood, confined to a circuit of not more than a <hi>German</hi> mile and a half. Of this tract he has given a map in his book.</p>
               <p>The author has prefixed "A Critical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Methods of arranging Plants," publiſhed by RAY and KNAUT, who had founded their claſſical diſtinctions on the <hi>fruit;</hi> and of thoſe publiſhed by RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINUS, and TOURNEFORT, founded on the <hi>flower.</hi> In the end, he gave the preference to RAY's ſyſtem, and adhered to it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his life. His criticiſm on RIVINUS brought upon him the reſentment of the author, at that time far advanced in years, who anſwered his objections. DILLENIUS had written in a ſtile that was but too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible; and can only be excuſed, in ſome meaſure, as natural to the warmth of a young author; though it has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged, that he had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the argument.</p>
               <p>Nothing can ſhew the early ſkill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable induſtry of DILLENIUS more ſtrongly, than his being able to produce ſo great a number of plants in ſo ſmall a tract.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0179600402:167"/>
He has not enumerated fewer than 980 ſpecies, of what were then called the more perfect plants; that is, excluſive of the <hi>Muſhroom</hi> claſs, and all the <hi>Moſſes.</hi> DIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENIUS entered minutely into the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this claſs; and, by his diligence and diſcoveries, extended the bounds of that field, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> botaniſts had ſo ſucceſsfully cultivated before him. More had been done in <hi>England</hi> in this way than in any other nation. The <hi>Pinax</hi> of <hi>Caſpar</hi> BAUHINE contains but fifty ſpecies; ſo little had the <hi>Muſci</hi> been regarded before. The firſt edition of RAY's <hi>Synopſis,</hi> printed in 1690, not more than about eighty kinds; whereas by the inveſtigations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> botaniſts, particularly of DOODY, SHERARD, VERNON, LLHWYD, ROBIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, PETIVER, BOBART, and others, this order was ſo far augmented in the ſecond edition of the ſame work, in 1696, as to contain upwards of 170 ſpecies.</p>
               <p>DILLENIUS was, however, the firſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who examined them with a view to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerical characters, and divided the <hi>Moſſes,</hi> and <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> each into ſeparate <hi>genera.</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0179600402:168"/>
It is in this book that we firſt meet with <hi>Bryum, Hypnum, Mnium, Sphagnum, Liche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noides,</hi> and <hi>Lichenaſtrum,</hi> as generical names. The four firſt of theſe, were terms in uſe with the <hi>Patres Botanici,</hi> although neglected by the reſtorers of the ſcience, who had ranked all under the general term <hi>Muſcus;</hi> except the <hi>Lichen, Lycopodium,</hi> and <hi>Polytri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum.</hi> To demonſtrate his accuracy and diligence, it may be obſerved, that, in the environs of <hi>Gieſſen</hi> alone, DILLENIUS diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered more than 200 ſpecies of <hi>Moſſes,</hi> of which 140 were new: of the <hi>Muſhroom</hi> order he enumerates 160, of which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 90 were ſuch as he judged had not been noticed by any author before. The plants in this catalogue are diſpoſed in the order of flowering, throughout all the year. The places of growth are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, with critical obſervations on many of the ſpecies.</p>
               <p>The Appendix contains a liſt of twenty plants, additional to thoſe of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, diſcovered in the immediate environs of <hi>Gieſſen;</hi> and an enumeration of upwards of 100 ſpecies, obſerved by the author, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

the bounds circumſcribed in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue. This renders the book, in a great meaſure, a <hi>Flora</hi> of the plants of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> Then follows a deſcription of the <hi>new</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Catalogue. Theſe are ſucceeded by the eſtabliſhment of his new <hi>genera</hi> of <hi>Moſſes, Fungi,</hi> and a variety of others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to near 100, of which ſome of former authors are here only amended; but the far greater part are of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, and entirely new; and the parts of fructification ſeparately delineated, in 16 copper-plates. This part of his work has been of great authority with ſucceeding writers; and many of theſe characters have ſtood the teſt of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>The merit of this work fixed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the author, as a perfectly ſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic botaniſt, and attracted the notice of all the eminent profeſſors, and admirers of the ſcience: among others, that of Mr. <hi>William,</hi> afterwards Dr. SHERARD, to whom we owe that DILLENIUS was brought to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in the end fixed in the profeſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at <hi>Oxford.</hi> SHERARD was, at that time, among the few who patronized and cultivated the ſcience in <hi>England.</hi> He was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0179600402:170"/>
lately returned from <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and having regretted the neglect of the <hi>Cryptogamia</hi> claſs, he was ſo enamoured with the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of DILLENIUS in that branch, that he entered into correſpondence with him, and procured ſpecimens from him, and afterwards brought him to <hi>England.</hi> No man was more cloſely devoted to a favourite muſe than DILLENIUS was to <hi>Flora;</hi> and, after his arrival in <hi>England,</hi> he purſued his ſtudy with uncommon ardour, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding diligence. The acquiſition of ſo able a man, was probably an additional mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with the Conſul, to attempt the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of botany in the univerſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DILLENIUS came into <hi>England</hi> in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1721, where he had not long reſided before he undertook a work that was much deſired; that of publiſhing a new edition of the <hi>Synopſis Stirpium Britannicarum</hi> of RAY. It had been laſt printed in 1696, and was become ſcarce. DILLENIUS hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly attached himſelf to RAY's ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, and even improved it in ſome parts (though he intimates in one of his letters to a friend, that he was not allowed to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0179600402:171"/>
make all the changes he wiſhed for), and being furniſhed with ample means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the book, by his diſcovery of new ſpecies of <hi>Cryptogamia,</hi> and by the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of new <hi>genera;</hi> being alſo enabled, by the diſcoveries of many ingenious men, whoſe names he enumerates in the preface, greatly to enlarge <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany; and, through the ſkill and aſſiſtance of Dr. RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARDSON, Mr. <hi>James</hi> SHERARD, and others, being ſufficiently qualified to add the old <hi>Britiſh,</hi> if I may ſo ſay, to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> botany, he publiſhed a third edition in 1724, much to the ſatisfaction of all the lovers of the ſcience throughout <hi>Europe.</hi> Twenty-four plates of rare plants were add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this edition; and, beſides many valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able notes, and emendations in the <hi>genera,</hi> the addition of new ſpecies was very great. The accumulation to this book from DIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENIUS's own diſcoveries, and from the communications of others, whoſe names are mentioned in the preface, particularly thoſe of Dr. SHERARD and Dr. RICHARDSON, amounted to near 40 new <hi>Fungi,</hi> as many <hi>Marine</hi> plants, upwards of 150 <hi>Moſſes,</hi> and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0179600402:172"/>
conſiderably above 200 other plants, which had been diſcovered to be natives of <hi>Britain,</hi> ſince the publication of the ſecond edition; the whole number of <hi>Britiſh</hi> plants being about 2200, as they ſtand in this book. But here it may be obſerved, that botaniſts had not at that time ſufficiently eſtabliſhed ſpecific diſtinctions; and this number could not ſtand the teſt of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> rules, which has ſince reduced the number to fewer than 1800.</p>
               <p>DILLENIUS ſeems to have divided his time, before his eſtabliſhment at <hi>Oxford,</hi> principally between the country reſidence of Mr. <hi>James</hi> SHERARD, at <hi>Eltham,</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> the Conſul's houſe in town; and his own lodgings, which, in the year 1728, were in <hi>Barking Alley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1727, Dr. THRELKELD pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his <hi>Synopſis Stirpium Hibernicarum,</hi> in which he had introduced ſome ſevere ſtrictures on DILLENIUS, principally level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the introduction of his new generical names. He alſo inveighs againſt him for unneceſſarily multiplying the ſpecies of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0179600402:173"/>
plants. See the articles, <hi>Anagallis aquatica, Dens Leonis, Lichenoides, Muſcus trichoides, Stellaria,</hi> &amp;c. DILLENIUS, though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the harſh and coarſe language of THRELKELD's criticiſms, had temper enough to forbear entering into any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy on this occaſion. He probably did not think THRELKELD's objections of any force ſufficient to influence men of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſcience, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> botaniſt had but little regarded any true principles of generical diſtinction. In a letter he wrote ſoon after the publication of the <hi>Iriſh Flora,</hi> after complaining of the groſſneſs of THRELKELD's cenſures, he informs his correſpondent that there was but one plant recited in the book, which was not known before as a native of <hi>Ireland.</hi> This, he adds, is the <hi>Pſeudo-ſtachys Alpina</hi> of <hi>Caſpar</hi> BAUHINE (<hi>Stachys Alpina</hi> Lin.); and this he had inſerted on the authority of Mr. HEATON's manuſcript.</p>
               <p>About this time he had it in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to publiſh a new edition of the <hi>Synopſis,</hi> with the addition of the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> names;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0179600402:174"/>
and the times of flowering—an article neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the former editions. This deſign was laid aſide, and an <hi>Appendix</hi> intended, for which ample materials were in hand, received from different quarters, particularly from Dr. RICHARDSON, of <hi>North Bierly,</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and from Mr. BREWER, who had reſided two ſeaſons at <hi>Bangor,</hi> purpoſely to inveſtigate, and collect the plants of <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and the neighbouring parts. BREWER was very ſucceſsful in his reſearches, and ſent at different times great numbers of ſcarce plants to DILLENIUS. This <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> alſo miſcarried. In the mean time, all theſe exertions were favourable to the purpoſe he ever had in view, of completing the <hi>Hiſtoria Muſcorum. Wales</hi> was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive ſource of new ſubjects in this way, and DILLENIUS availed himſelf of BREW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER's reſearches.</p>
               <p>Whatever might be the preciſe nature of his engagement with the <hi>Conſul,</hi> it appears that DILLENIUS, being doubtful of the ſucceſs of the <hi>Oxford</hi> ſcheme, had formed a deſign of reſiding ſome time,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0179600402:175"/>
if not finally ſettling, in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> In a letter to a correſpondent of that county, dated Dec. 16, 1727, he writes thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Pray Sir, how is it to board in that country? if I have done here, and <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> fails, as its likely it may do, I could reſolve to go and live there ſome time, if not for good and all; if any ſmall buſineſs ſhould encourage it."</q> Ever ſince his reſidence in <hi>England,</hi> his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been various, and important, and his aſſiduity as diſtinguiſhed as his abilities. Since his arrival in 1721, he had publiſhed the <hi>Synopſis,</hi> of which he deſigned, if he did not himſelf engrave, all the figures. He ſoon after began the <hi>Hortus Elthamenſis.</hi> He collected materials for a new edition of, or Appendix to, the <hi>Synopſis.</hi> He never loſt ſight of his <hi>Hiſtoria Muſcorum.</hi> Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to all which, the buſineſs of the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> appears to have been purſued with vigour. In a letter dated Dec. 26, 1727, he ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"We have entered almoſt all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; but to put it in order, and to write it fair, will require ſome years ſtill."</q>

               <p>DILLENIUS was now arrived at that ſituation, which had probably been the main object of his wiſhes; and which he conſidered equally as the completion of his hopes, the aſylum againſt future diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and the field of all that grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for which his taſte and purſuits prompted him to wiſh, and qualified him to enjoy. Add to all this, he was placed in the ſociety of the learned, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleteſt ſenſe of that word, and at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of every information, which the ſtores of both antient and modern erudition could diſplay, to an inquiſitive mind.</p>

                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0179600402:178"/>
The plan of the <hi>Hortus Elthamenſis</hi> had been laid ſo early as the year 1724, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after publiſhing the <hi>Synopſis;</hi> and ſome of the plants were figured and deſcribed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dr. SHERARD's death. The work was now carried on with vigour, and was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1732, under the following title:</p>
               <p>"HORTUS ELTHAMENSIS, <hi>ſeu Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rariorum quas in Horto ſuo Elthami in Cantio coluit Vir ornatiſſimus et praeſtantiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Jacobus</hi> SHERARD, <hi>M.D. Soc.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0179600402:179"/>
                  <hi>Welch</hi> plants were included. They are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the alphabetical order. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are of the natural ſize as much as may be. The <hi>ſynonyma</hi> of former authors are quoted and accompanied by copious critical examinations and obſervations, the better to aſcertain the ſpecies. Several new <hi>genera</hi> are eſtabliſhed, many of the new <hi>Gerania</hi> are figured, and a very copious hiſtory of the <hi>genus Meſembryanthemum</hi> given; with a ſynoptical view of all the ſpecies, of which fifty-four are deſcribed and figured in this work<note n="*" place="bottom">The plates of the <hi>Hortus Elthamenſis</hi> were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſold to a <hi>Dutch</hi> bookſeller; who caſt off an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, accompanied with the denominations only of the ſpecies. This was done at <hi>Leyden</hi> in 1774; and many copies have found their way into this kingdom.</note>.</p>
               <p>We find by the liſt of graduates, that DILLENIUS was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Phyſic in <hi>St. John's College,</hi> April 3, 1735.</p>
               <p>In the ſummer of 1736, LINNAEUS viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Profeſſor at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and, although DILLENIUS did not reliſh the ſexual ſyſtem, about that time firſt divulged, yet LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS returned with the higheſt opinion of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0179600402:180"/>
his merit; and, as I have obſerved on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other occaſion, expreſſed himſelf in theſe terms: <q rend="inline">"<hi>In Anglia nullus eſt qui genera cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat vel intelligat praeterquam</hi> DILLENIUS."</q>
               </p>
               <p>LINNAEUS, after this time, correſponded with him, ſent him his <hi>Flora Lapponica,</hi> and dedicated to him the <hi>Critica Botanica.</hi> On which occaſion the Profeſſor ſent his acknowledgments in the following terms, in a letter, dated Aug. 18, 1737: <q rend="inline">"<hi>Vidi, accepi et legi Floram tuam Lapponicam multa cum voluptate; utinam plures iſtiuſmodi nobis proſtarent tali ſtudio, et cura elaboratae, in hac te virum praeſtitiſti.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>During this period, DILLENIUS held fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent correſpondence and communication with HALLER, whom he eſteemed, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the more, on account of the affinity of his ſyſtem with that of RAY, which he had himſelf adopted. It appears, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered HALLER as almoſt the only man qualified to carry on the <hi>Pinax,</hi> and wiſhed him to have been his ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>About this time, he was employed with Dr. SHAW, in reducing to order and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, that learned traveller's collection of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0179600402:181"/>
Oriental plants. As they were all dried ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens, and the collection extenſive, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 640 ſpecies, it required the aid of an able hand to diſtinguiſh and apply ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms to ſo conſiderable a number. This catalogue, therefore, which is annexed, with the engravings of a few of the plants, to the firſt edition of Dr. SHAW's elaborate work, may be conſidered eventually, as the work of the botanical Profeſſor.</p>
               <p>After the completion of the <hi>Hortus El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamenſis,</hi> he purſued his "Hiſtory of Moſſes" with great diligence. It has been obſerved before, that he had extended his reſearches into this part of nature, much further than any preceding botaniſt, having been the firſt diſcoverer of a great number of ſpecies, and having ſeparated thoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore deſcribed together by the general term <hi>Muſcus,</hi> into ſeveral <hi>genera,</hi> under the names of <hi>Sphagnum, Fontinalis, Bryum,</hi> and <hi>Hypnum;</hi> taking his diſtinctions, as well from the <hi>habit</hi> of the plant, (to which the accurate HALLER thought he paid too much regard,) as from the figure and ſituation of that part of the ſructification which is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0179600402:182"/>
now conſidered as the <hi>capſule.</hi> By means of the excellent botanical library of the SHERARDS, and free acceſs to their ample <hi>Herbarium,</hi> and that of Mr. DU BOIS, who had, with Mr. DOODY and ſeveral others, ſignalized themſelves by their diſcoveries this way ſome years before, DILLENIUS enjoyed advantages which perhaps no other ſituation could have afforded. Beſides which, to give himſelf all further opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities that <hi>Britain</hi> allowed of making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in this department, he took a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney himſelf into <hi>Wales,</hi> in the ſummer of 1726. In this excurſion he was attended by <hi>Samuel</hi> BREWER. They examined <hi>Cader Idris,</hi> and took up their reſidence at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor;</hi> ſearched <hi>Snowdon, Glyder,</hi> the <hi>Iſle of Angleſea;</hi> and viſited the <hi>Iſte of Man.</hi> Mr. GREEN, a clergyman of thoſe parts, was uſeful in directing their reſearches, and in aſſiſting DILLENIUS in the <hi>Welch</hi> names of places, and of plants. The Rev. <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> BROWN, M.A. Fellow of the Royal Society, is alſo commemorated, as having communicated many ſpecimens of the <hi>Cryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togamous</hi> tribe to our author, collected by

The uſes of particular kinds, whether in the general oeconomy of nature, or in medicine, or the other arts and conveniences of life.

When we conſider the minuteneſs of the objects of his inveſtigation, the accuracy of his deſcriptions, the critical examination and nice diſcrimination of each ſpecies, the labour and ſkill the author has exhibited in the ſelection of the <hi>ſynonyma,</hi> and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of them into chronological order, which is a highly meritorious part of the plan, "The Hiſtory of <hi>Moſſes</hi>" muſt be conſidered as a very extraordinary perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and, notwithſtanding any ſubſequent improvements in the arrangement of ſpecies, or in the reduction of them in conſequence of more perfect obſervations, or even in the microſcopical diſcoveries of HEDWIG re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the <hi>Genera,</hi> DILLENIUS's work muſt long be the baſis of knowledge in this part of nature, and muſt remain with poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity as an almoſt unexampled inſtance of patience, ingenuity, and ſcience, in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. This work, moreover, poſſeſſes a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over every other botanical publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that I am acquainted with, in having a complete index of the <hi>ſynonyma</hi> at length. An addition of the higheſt utility in works of this kind! and which thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with the writings of LINNAEUS can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but regret the want of, in the <hi>Species Plantarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole impreſſion of DILLENIUS's "Moſſes" was only 250 copies, of which 50 were on imperial paper. The original edition having become extremely ſcarce<note n="*" place="bottom">Poſterity will ſcarcely believe, that at the time of the publication of this work, and during the life of the author, the demand for books of natural hiſtory was ſo ſmall in <hi>England,</hi> that one guinea was thought a ſufficient price for this book. At this period, ten is not deemed too much; and, not long ſince, a copy, with the plates co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured by DILLENIUS himſelf, was ſold for twenty gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, or upwards.</note>, an impreſſion of the plates, with the names only annexed, was taken off in the year 1768, and publiſhed by <hi>John Millan.</hi> I here remark, that this was the firſt book printed in <hi>England,</hi> in which any of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſpecific characters were exhibited. Both the <hi>Flora Lapponica,</hi> and the <hi>Hortus Cliffortianus,</hi> are quoted in this volume.</p>

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0179600402:188"/>
There is little doubt that DILLENIUS intended to have proſecuted the <hi>Funguſſes,</hi> as he had done the <hi>Moſſes;</hi> and he appears to have had this deſign in contemplation early after he came to <hi>England.</hi> In a letter, written in Dec. 1726, he informs his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He was buſy in painting <hi>Fungi;</hi>"</q> and makes this employment an apology for not anſwering his letters in due time. We know that he correſponded with Dr. DEERING on this ſubject; who was himſelf well ſkilled in the knowledge of theſe productions, and had painted a great number, ſome of which he communicated to the Profeſſor.</p>
               <p>I have been informed, that Dr. DILLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIUS was of a corpulent habit of body: this circumſtance, united to his cloſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſtudy, probably tended to ſhorten his days. He was ſeized with an apoplexy in the laſt week of March, 1747; and died on the 2d of April, in the 60th year of his age.</p>
               <p>There is a portrait of him in the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gallery, or ſchool, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in which he is repreſented in the academical habit;

               <p>I have never been able to acquire that information my curioſity hath prompted me to wiſh for, relating to the domeſtic character, habits, temper, and diſpoſitions of Dr. DILLENIUS. Of thoſe whom I have converſed with, who were his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, I have learned, that he was modeſt, temperate, and gentle in all his conduct: that he was known to few who did not ſeek him; and, as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, from the bent of his ſtudies, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0179600402:190"/>
the cloſe application he gave to them, that his habits were of the recluſe kind. If it be allowable to form any opinions of men from the peruſal of their letters, ſome that I have ſeen, written by him, would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that he was naturally endowed with a placid diſpoſition, improved by a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical calmneſs of mind, which ſecured him in a conſiderable degree from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the incidental evils of life.

ſince I am unacquainted with any further circumſtances relating to him, than that he was educated a phyſician, and lived at <hi>North Bierly,</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> There he reſided upon his own eſtate, which was ample enough to render the practice of phyſic totally unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his well-being, from any lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive views.

ſome inſtances he had done in the <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> for the plants of <hi>Mendip</hi> and <hi>Chedder Rocks.</hi>

               <p>He was originally of <hi>Trowbridge,</hi> in <hi>Wilts,</hi> in which county he had a ſmall eſtate. He was engaged at one time in the woollen manufactory of that place; but, I believe, proved unſucceſsful in buſineſs. He attended DILLENIUS into <hi>Wales, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſey,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> in the ſummer of 1726; and afterwards remained the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the greater part of the next year, in that country; making his reſidence at <hi>Bangor,</hi> and taking his excurſions to <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and elſewhere, often accompanied by the Rev. Mr. GREEN, and Mr. <hi>William</hi> JONES. While in <hi>Wales,</hi> it was intended that he ſhould have gone over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to make a botanical tour through that kingdom; but that expedition never took place. So long a reſidence gave him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity not only of ſeeing the beauties of ſummer plants, but of collecting the <hi>Cryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togamia</hi> in winter, when they flouriſh moſt.

rare, or unknown to him before, and ſent them to DILLENIUS, to determine the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and fix the names.

But the ſecond part of the work, in which the author intended to have given the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, was never publiſhed; if indeed it was ever written.</p>
               <p>There is a Mr. <hi>Zanche</hi> SILLIARD, an apothecary of <hi>Dublin,</hi> mentioned by PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINSON, who ſeems to have poſſeſſed ſome botanical knowledge.

of this country. He is thought to have left a manuſcript on the ſubject, which it is conjectured was written about the year 1641, and from which THRELKELD took the <hi>Iriſh</hi> names of plants, who ſays, they were much more copious and exact than he could collect from any living authority. In the number of plants, it greatly exceeds any liſt we have extant of the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> names, or of thoſe in the <hi>Erſe</hi> tongue, among the <hi>Highlanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Towards the latter end of the century, ſome information was received relating to the natural hiſtory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from the tour of Dr. LLHWYD, as recorded in the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Tranſactions;</hi> and Dr. <hi>William</hi> SHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RARD, on his viſits to Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> RAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON, at <hi>Moyra,</hi> noticed many of the rare plants of that region.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0179600402:203"/>
papers are numerous, and are extant in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Thomas</hi> MOLYNEUX was profeſſor of phyſic in the univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to the ſtate, and to the army. About the beginning of this century, he drew up ſome account of the ſpontaneous vegetables of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which evidence, that he had applied to the ſtudy in a ſcientific manner.</p>
               <p>He communicated his papers to Dr. THRELKELD, who incorporated ſome of them into the body of his <hi>Synopſis,</hi> and placed the remainder at the end. Of Dr. THRELKELD I now proceed to give ſome account.</p>

                  <hi>Caleb</hi> THRELKELD, the author of the firſt treatiſe on the plants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was born the 31ſt of May, 1676, at <hi>Keiberg,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Kirkoſwald,</hi> in <hi>Cumberland.</hi> In the year 1698, he commenced maſter of arts in the univerſity of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and ſoon after ſettled at <hi>Low Huddleſceugh,</hi> near the place of his birth, in the character of a diſſenting miniſter. He had acquired a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0179600402:204"/>
taſte for botany and phyſic during his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> and continued to make a conſiderable progreſs in theſe ſtudies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that, in 1712, he took a doctor's degree in phyſic at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and the next ſpring, having a ſtraight income, and a large family, he removed to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſettled there in the united character of the divine, and phyſician. Finding himſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſucceed, in little more than a year, he ſent for his family, conſiſting of a wife, three ſons, and three daughters. His prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice as a phyſician, ſoon increaſed, ſo far as to enable him to drop his other character entirely, and devote himſelf wholly to phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. In 1727, he publiſhed his "SYNOPSIS STIRPIUM HIBERNICARUM;" and died, after a ſhort ſickneſs, of a violent fever, at his houſe in <hi>Mark's Alley, Frances Street,</hi> April 28, 1728; and was buried in the new burial ground belonging to <hi>St. Patrick's,</hi> near <hi>Cavan Street;</hi> to which place his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies were attended by a ſet of children, educated by a ſociety of gentlemen, to which inſtitution he had acted as phyſician. And my memorialiſt adds, that he was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0179600402:205"/>
by the poor, to whom he had been, both as a man, and as a phyſician, a kind benefactor.</p>
               <p>It does not appear that Dr. THRELKELD publiſhed any other work than the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though he meditated a general hiſtory of plants:</p>
               <p>"SYNOPSIS STIRPIUM HIBERNICA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUM, <hi>alphabetice diſpoſitarum; five, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatio de Plantis indigenis, praeſertim Dublinenſibus inſtituta.</hi> Being a ſhort Treatiſe of Native Plants, eſpecially ſuch as grow ſpontaneouſly in the vicinity of <hi>Dublin;</hi> with their <hi>Latin, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Names, and an Abridgment of their Virtues; with ſeveral new Diſcoveries.

               <p>The author, after a dedication to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and a preface, which, though written in a quaint ſtile, proves him to have been a man of ſome
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0179600402:206"/>
erudition in the ſcience, enumerates all the plants he had obſerved in the environs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and of all ſuch as he had gained authentic intelligence, from other parts of the kingdom. He gives, firſt, the old <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> names, generally from <hi>Caſpar</hi> BAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HINE's <hi>Pinax;</hi> then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name; and afterwards the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> ſubjoining ſome account of the quality of the plant, and its uſe in medicine, and oeconomy.</p>
               <p>He has moreover interſperſed ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervations: to inſtance, under the <hi>Betula,</hi> or Birch Tree, he ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The <hi>Iriſh</hi> grammarians remark, that all the names of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> letters, are names of trees."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Under <hi>Braſſica,</hi> he obſerves, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the word is only the <hi>Celtic Praiſſeagh</hi> put into a <hi>Latin</hi> termination; the <hi>Latin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other than the <hi>Celtic</hi> language cloathed with the Aeolic dialect, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> is the <hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> language cloathed with <hi>Normandy French,</hi> as all antiquaries will allow."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that THRELKELD no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices the good effects of the <hi>Lythrum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaria,</hi> in a dyſentery: a ſimple ſince his

He alſo ſpeaks in high terms, and from his own experience, of the powers uſually attributed to the <hi>Meny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes trifoliata,</hi> or Bog-bean. He quotes from Dr. VAUGHAN a caſe of the fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Mackenbay, or <hi>Euphorbia Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berna. Dr.</hi> MOLYNEUX has obſerved, that the <hi>Geniſta ſpinoſa,</hi> or Whins (Ulex euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peus <hi>Lin.</hi>) although common in other parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is not ſeen in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Connaught.</hi> A ſingular fact, if the obſervation be ſufficiently accurate.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Appendix,</hi> printed from the papers of Dr. MOLYNEUX, the reader meets with ſeveral curious obſervations. Among others, an inſtance of the effects of the roots of <hi>common Henbane</hi> upon ſeveral perſons, who having eaten them inſtead of ſkirrets, were affected with vertiginous ſymptoms, and in one caſe a frenzy enſued, which held the perſon two or three days.

               <p>AT the dawn of learning, the ſeeds of botany had been firſt ſown in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by Dr. TURNER, at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> They can ſcarcely, however, be ſaid to have ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, until a century afterwards, under the foſtering care of Mr. RAY. By his cultivation, they took root, although not invigorated by public ſupport. In the mean time, through the munificence of the Earl of DANBY, <hi>Oxford</hi> experienced the benefit of a public inſtitution in aid of this ſcience, and botany flouriſhed under the care of MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RISON.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0179600402:213"/>
After his time, to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of DILLENIUS, it languiſhed; no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication marked its progreſs; and its hiſtory at <hi>Oxford</hi> is void of intereſting facts. Nearly the ſame languor prevailed after the time of Mr. RAY at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and botany attained no ſtrength till the time of Dr. MARTYN, who, under the patronage of the univerſity, gave the firſt public lecture in that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the year 1727.</p>
               <p>Of this learned botaniſt, I am now, in the order of time, to preſent the reader with ſome account: and here I find myſelf agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably anticipated by the relation of his life and writings, prefixed to his "Diſſertations on the Aeneids of VIRGIL," printed in 1770, 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, and drawn up by his moſt reſpectable ſon, and ſucceſſor in the profeſſorſhip; with whoſe friendſhip and correſpondence, I have on this occaſion a ſincere pleaſure in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, I have long been honoured. Hence I ſhall briefly recite from theſe anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, only the leading circumſtances in the life of Dr. MARTYN, as connected with his profeſſorial character; and conclude with a ſhort account of his botanical writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0179600402:214"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> MARTYN was born in the city of <hi>London,</hi> Sept. 12, 1699, and was deſigned by his father for the profeſſion of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; but his early and ſtrong propenſity to learning and ſcience, in the end over-ruled that deſign. He had from his youth an attachment to botany; and this taſte was further excited by his acquaintance with Mr. WILMER, afterwards demonſtrator at <hi>Chelſea</hi> Garden; and confirmed by an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with, and the countenance of, Dr. SHERARD, in the year 1719. In the year 1720, he tranſlated from the <hi>French,</hi> Dr. TOURNEFORT's "Hiſtory of the Plants growing about <hi>Paris;</hi>" and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a like catalogue of the plants about <hi>London,</hi> he collected, with unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the native plants of the environs; making for this purpoſe ſometimes very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive excurſions, and almoſt ever on foot. He had once conceived a ſcheme for form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a method from the <hi>Seed-leaves,</hi> and had ſown a great number of ſeeds in order to obſerve the difference between them. He early became acquainted with DILLENIUS, and co-operated with him in forming a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0179600402:215"/>
of botaniſts, which conſiſted of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen members. This ſociety kept together till the year 1726. He continued, during the years 1723 and 1724, to make his excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in ſearch of plants more frequent, and extended them farther, into <hi>Middleſex, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Kent.</hi> At the ſame time he ſtudied Inſects, continued his obſervations on the Seed-leaves, and made many others on the Sexes of Plants. He had, ſeveral years before this time, tranſlated from the <hi>Latin,</hi> an ode on that ſubject, preſented to CAMERARIUS, and printed in that Author's epiſtle <hi>De Sexu Plantarum.</hi> The tranſlation may be ſeen in BLAIR's "Botanic Eſſays."</p>
               <p>In the ſummer of 1724, he travelled into <hi>Wales,</hi> by <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> returning by <hi>Hereford, Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Oxford;</hi> by which he extended the objects of his ſtudies, and augmented his collection of <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants; inſomuch, that at length it comprehended 1400 ſpecimens.</p>
               <p>In 1725 and 1726, he read lectures in botany in <hi>London,</hi> and was recommended by Dr. SHERARD and Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE to exerciſe the ſame function at <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0179600402:216"/>
where, on the death of BRADLEY, he was choſen Profeſſor of Botany; and continued to give lectures for ſeveral years, until the want of a garden, and his long abſence from the buſineſs of phyſic, which he had engaged in, rendered it incommodious to him.</p>
               <p>In 1727, Dr. MARTYN was admitted a member of the Royal Society; and was ſo active in the committee for regulating the library and muſeum, in 1731, that he had his bond for annual payment cancelled by an order of council, as an acknowledgment of his ſervices.</p>
               <p>In 1730, he was admitted of <hi>Emanuel</hi> College, with an intention to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded regularly with the degrees in phyſic; but his marriage, and his attention to the practice of the profeſſion, prevented him from finiſhing his deſign. In the mean time, he read lectures in Botany and the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> both at <hi>Cambridge</hi> and in <hi>London,</hi> in the years 1730 and 1731. In the beginning of the year 1733, he was elected Profeſſor of Botany by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous voice of the univerſity.</p>

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0179600402:217"/>
Dr. MARTYN had practiſed phyſic for three years in the city, but on account of an aſthmatic complaint, removed in the year 1730 to <hi>Chelſea;</hi> where he continued the exerciſe of that proſeſſion, until his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Streatham,</hi> in 1752. In 1761, he reſigned his profeſſorſhip; and ſoon after, in gratitude for the favour of having choſen him, and his ſon after him, to this poſt, he preſented to the univerſity his botanical li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, conſiſting of upwards of 200 vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; his <hi>Hortus Siccus</hi> of Exotics, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 2600 ſpecimens; near 250 drawings of <hi>Fungi;</hi> his collection of Seeds, and Seed Veſſels; and his <hi>Materia Medica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He removed to <hi>Chelſea</hi> about a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death; which event took place on the 29th of January, 1768.</p>
               <p>The Profeſſor was the author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing publications:</p>

In the year 1720, Dr. MARTYN, as hath been obſerved, had made a Tranſlation of TOURNEFORT's "Hiſtory of Plants about <hi>Paris;</hi>" and at the ſame time meditated a Catalogue of thoſe of the environs of <hi>London.</hi> The latter was never finiſhed; nor was the Tranſlation publiſhed, till twelve years afterwards, when it appeared under the following title: "TOURNEFORT's Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Plants growing about <hi>Paris,</hi> with their Uſes in Phyſic; and a Mechanical Account of the Operation of Medicines. Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and accommodated to the Plants growing in <hi>Great Britain.</hi>" In 2 vols. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1732.</p>
               <p>"The Six Alphabets" of TOURNEFORT are reduced into one; all the uſeful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, both from the edition which came out by the united care of SHERARD and BOERHAAVE, and from that which was publiſhed by <hi>Bernard de</hi> JUSSIEU, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.

               <p>A Remark concerning the Sex of Holly. Vol. xlviii. p. 613. Dr. MARTYN firſt obſerved the Holly Tree to be <hi>Dioecious,</hi> in his own garden at <hi>Streatham,</hi> in <hi>Surry.</hi> Dr. WATSON, Mr. MILLER, and ſubſequent botaniſts, not only found his obſervations true, but diſcovered, that the ſame trees bore alſo hermaphrodite flowers. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the removal of it, in the <hi>Flora An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glica,</hi> to the claſs <hi>Polygamia.</hi> But as it does not appear that the remaining ſpecies of the <hi>Ilex</hi> are ſubject to the ſame change, the genus ſtands in the works of LINNAEUS in the <hi>Tetrandrous</hi> claſs as before.</p>
               <p>It is not without the ſtricteſt juſtice that the term indefatigable is applied to this learned man. His avocations from buſineſs were wholly devoted to the cauſe of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he contributed to ſerve in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ways. The numerous works he was engaged in, and the variety of his manuſcript remains, amply teſtify this truth. At one time he was concerned in a periodical pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. He was a coadjutor with Mr. EAMES,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0179600402:223"/>
in abridging the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions;</hi> and was employed in writing the firſt three volumes of the "General Dictionary," in which the lives of BELLONIUS, BOCCONE, and BRUNSFELSIUS, were written by him. He tranſlated BOERHAAVE's "Treatiſe on the Powers of Medicine;" HARRIS's "Treatiſe on the Acute Diſeaſes of Infants;" and, jointly with Mr. CHAMBERS, gave, in 5 volumes in octavo, in 1742, a Tranſlation, or rather an "Abridgment of Philoſophical Papers, from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at <hi>Paris.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Dr. MARTYN was the author of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen papers, printed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions.</hi> His Tranſlation of the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gics</hi> and <hi>Bucolics</hi> of VIRGIL, with his notes upon this his favourite poet, hath extended his fame among the learned of all nations. To the claſſical reader in general, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ample ſatisfaction; but to thoſe who join to ſuch elegant enjoyment, a knowledge of the learned Editor's favourite ſcience, theſe volumes muſt afford a gratification, which they will in vain ſeek for elſewhere. His great knowledge both of antient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0179600402:224"/>
ſcience, relating to plants, enabled him to appropriate the modern appellations, with a degree of judgment, that has been highly approved of by thoſe who know the difficulty of the undertaking, under that almoſt total want of ſpecific diſtinction, which occurs in the writings of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
               <p>In the year 1737, our Author entered into correſpondence with LINNAEUS. It is one of thoſe notices that can only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to a lover of ſimilar ſtudies, that he was, if not the firſt, at leaſt one of the earlieſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> writers, who announced the northern genius to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> reader. This was done by the Profeſſor's extract from the <hi>Flora Lapponica,</hi> printed in the edition of the <hi>Georgics</hi> in 1741. It was ſome years afterwards, before the ſyſtem of the <hi>Swede</hi> made any progreſs in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only remark further, that beſides the obligations which literature in general owes to this learned Profeſſor, that which I call more ſtrictly <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany, received conſiderable augmentation from his labours; particularly from his methodizing "The

               <p>ALTHOUGH the ingenious author, whom I commemorate in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, does not ſtrictly rank among the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of indigenous botany; yet I cannot paſs over in ſilence, a man, to whom the ſcience owes one of its moſt elegant, and ſuperb productions. Mr. <hi>Mark</hi> CATESBY was, I believe, one of thoſe men, whom a paſſion for natural hiſtory very early al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured from the intereſting purſuits of life; and it led him at length to croſs the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> that he might read the volume of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a country but imperfectly explored, and where her beauties were diſplayed in a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0179600402:227"/>
more extended and magnificent ſcale, than the narrow bounds of his native country exhibited. It is but too true, that the world at large will for ever treat with ridicule and diſdain that man, who, thus deſerting the paths that lead to riches, to preſerment, or to honour, gives himſelf up to what are commonly deemed unimportant and trifling occupations. Few will give him credit for that ſecret ſatisfaction, for that inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure, which the inveſtigation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in all her objects, inceſſantly holds forth to his mind; or believe, that ſuch employment can poſſibly compenſate for the ſolid treaſures of gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mark</hi> CATESBY was born about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of 1679, or the beginning of the next year. He acquaints us himſelf, that he had very early a propenſity to the ſtudy of nature; and that his wiſh for higher gratifications in this way, firſt led him to <hi>London,</hi> which he emphatically ſtiles <q rend="inline">"the center of ſcience;"</q> and afterwards impelled him to ſeek further ſources, in diſtant parts of the globe. The reſidence of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0179600402:228"/>
in <hi>Virginia</hi> favoured his deſign; and he went to that country in 1712, where he ſtaid ſeven years, admiring, and collecting the various productions of the country, without having laid any direct plan for the work he afterwards accompliſhed. During this reſidence, he communicated ſeeds and ſpecimens of plants, both dried, and in a growing ſtate, to Mr. DALE, of <hi>Braintree,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and, ſome of his obſervations on the country, being communicated by this means to Dr. <hi>William</hi> SHERARD, procured him the friendſhip and patronage of that gentleman. On his return to <hi>England,</hi> in 1719, he was encouraged by the aſſiſtance of ſeveral of the nobility, of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, Dr. SHERARD, and other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, whoſe names he has recorded, to return to <hi>America,</hi> with the profeſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of deſcribing, delineating, and painting the more curious objects of nature. <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> was fixed on, as the place of his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where he arrived in May 1722. He firſt examined the lower parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, making excurſions from <hi>Charles Town;</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0179600402:229"/>
and afterwards ſojourned, for ſome time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Indians</hi> in the mountainous regions at and about <hi>Fort Moore.</hi> He then extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his reſearches through <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida;</hi> and having ſpent nearly three years on the continent, he viſited the <hi>Bahama Iſlands,</hi> taking his reſidence in the <hi>Iſle of Providence;</hi> carrying on his plan, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly making collections of fiſhes, and ſubmarine productions.</p>
               <p>On his return to <hi>England,</hi> in the year 1726, his labours having met with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his patrons, Mr. CATESBY made himſelf maſter of the art of Etching; and, retiring to <hi>Hoxton,</hi> employed himſelf in carrying on his great work, which he publiſhed in numbers of twenty plants each. The firſt appeared in the latter end of the year 1730; and the firſt volume, conſiſting of 100 plates, was finiſhed in 1732: the ſecond, in 1743; and the Appendix, of twenty plates, in the year 1748.</p>
               <p>A regular account of each number, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Dr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> MORTIMER, Secretary of the Royal Society, was laid before the

               <p>THOSE who are converſant with the writings of MILLER, will recollect the frequent mention of the name of Dr. <hi>William</hi> HOUSTON; and that the exotic botany of <hi>England</hi> was greatly enriched by his means. If I err not, Mr. HOUSTON went firſt to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> in the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſurgeon; and, upon his return, after two years reſidence at <hi>Leyden,</hi> took degrees in phyſic under BOERHAAVE. This was in 1728 and 1729. At <hi>Leyden,</hi> he inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſet of Experiments on Brutes; ſome
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0179600402:239"/>
of which were made in concert with the late celebrated <hi>Van</hi> SWIETEN.

               <p>It appears that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society ſoon after his return from <hi>Holland;</hi> and that he went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> I am not able to aſcertain his fixed reſidence in that part of the world, although I conjecture, it was principally at the <hi>Logwood Settlement;</hi> from whence he ſent a deſcription and figure of the <hi>Dorſtenia Contrayerva,</hi> which were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> Vol. xxxvii. This was the firſt authentic account received of that drug, although known in <hi>England</hi> from the time of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> DRAKE, or earlier. He alſo ſent to his friend at <hi>Chelſea,</hi> the ſeeds of many rare and

               <p>He fell a ſacrifice to the heat of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and died in July 1733.

            </argument>
            <p>THE increaſing cultivation of exotics in <hi>England,</hi> from the beginning of the preſent century, and the greater diffuſion of taſte for the elegancies and luxuries of the Stove and Green-houſe, naturally tended to raiſe up a ſpirit of improvement and real ſcience in the arts of culture. To preſerve far-fetched rarities, it became neceſſary to ſcrutinize into the true principles of the art, which ultimately muſt depend on the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0179600402:245"/>
knowledge of the climate of each plant, and the ſoil in which it flouriſhes, in that climate.</p>
            <p>Under the influence of ſuch men as SLOANE, the SHERARDS, and other opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent encouragers of the ſcience, gardeners acquired botanical knowledge, and were excited to greater exertions in their art. Hence, I believe, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gardeners have ſhewn themſelves equal, if not ſuperior, to moſt others. My plan does not allow me to deviate ſo far, as to cite authors on the ſubject of gardening, unleſs eminent for their acquaintance with <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany. Some have diſtinguiſhed themſelves in this way; and I cannot omit to mention with applauſe, the names of FAIRCHILD, KNOWLTON, GORDON, and MILLER. The firſt of theſe made himſelf known to the Royal Society, by ſome "New Experiments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the different, and ſometimes contrary Motion of the Sap;" which were printed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Vol. xxxiii. p. 127. He alſo aſſiſted in making experiments, by which the ſexes of plants were illuſtrated, and the doctrine
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0179600402:246"/>
confirmed. Mr. FAIRCHILD died in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1729.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> KNOWLTON was, in the earlier part of his life, gardener to Conſul SHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RARD; but I find him in that ſtation at <hi>Loneſborough,</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> in the ſervice of the Earl of BURLINGTON, in the year 1728; in which place, I believe, he ſpent the greater part, if not the whole, of the remainder of his life. His zeal for <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany was uncommonly great, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him ſucceſsfully to the learned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſts of this country. From Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, he received eminent civilities. He merits notice in theſe memoirs, were it only to record his diſcovery of that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar production, the Globe <hi>Conferva,</hi> or Moor Balls (<hi>Conferva Aegagrophila</hi> Lin.); which he firſt found in <hi>Wallingfen Mere.</hi> I have read a letter from him to a correſpondent, written in the year 1728; and another in 1729: in one of which he relates his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waded near a quarter of a mile into the lake to collect them; which is not done
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0179600402:247"/>
without ſome difficulty, as they lie at the depth of from two to three feet. At an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time he was more ſucceſsful, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected near a buſhel at once. He deſcribes them to his friend, under the name of <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> or globular Balls of Moſs, of the ſize of a tennis ball.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> KNOWLTON was a man of general curioſity and obſervation; and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other matters, not inattentive to the purſuits of the antiquary.</p>
               <p>We find Extracts of Two Letters from him "to Mr. <hi>Mark</hi> CATESBY, F.R.S. concerning the Situation of the ancient Town <hi>Delgovicia,</hi> and of two Men of an extraordinary Bulk and Weight." <hi>Phil.

                  <hi>James</hi> GORDON, of Mile End, eminent for his ſucceſsful cultivation of exotics, was well acquainted with <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany.

               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> MILLER was born in the year 1691. His father was gardener to the Company of Apothecaries at <hi>Chelſea;</hi> and his ſon ſucceeded him in that office, in the year 1722. He raiſed himſelf by his merit, from a ſtate of obſcurity, to a degree of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0179600402:249"/>
eminence, but rarely if ever before equalled, in the character of a gardener. It is not uncommon to give the term of Botaniſt, to any man that can recite by memory, the plants of his garden. Mr. MILLER roſe much above this attainment. He added to the knowledge of the theory and practice of gardening, that of the ſtructure and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of plants, and was early and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally verſed in the methods of RAY and TOURNEFORT. Habituated to the uſe of theſe, from his younger years, it was not without reluctance that he was brought to adopt the ſyſtem of LINNAEUS; but he was convinced, at length, by the arguments of the late Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON and Mr. HUDSON, and embraced it. To his ſuperior ſkill in his art, the curious owe the culture and preſervation of a variety of fine plants, which, in leſs ſkilful hands, would have failed, at that time, to adorn the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His objects were not confined to exotics: few were better acquainted with the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genous plants, of which, he ſucceſſively cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated moſt of the rare ſpecies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0179600402:250"/>
He maintained a correſpondence with many of the moſt eminent botaniſts on the continent: among others, with LINNAEUS, who ſaid of his Dictionary, <hi>Non erit Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Hortulanorum, ſed Botanicorum.</hi> By foreigners he was emphatically ſtiled <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulanorum Princeps.</hi> He was admitted a member of the Botanical Academy of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and of the Royal Society of <hi>London,</hi> in which he was occaſionally honoured by being choſen of the council. Mr. MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER was the only perſon I ever knew, who remembered to have ſeen Mr. RAY. I ſhall not eaſily forget the pleaſure that enlightened his countenance, it ſo ſtrongly expreſſed the <hi>Virgilium tantum vidi,</hi> when, in ſpeaking of that revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth.</p>
               <p>Mr. MILLER's infirmities induced him to reſign his office in the Garden, a little time before his deceaſe, which took place December 18, 1771, in the 80th year of his age. He left a very large <hi>Herbarium</hi> of Exotics, principally the produce of the <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> Garden.</p>

In the year 1728, Mr. MILLER com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Royal Society, "A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of raiſing ſome Exotic Seeds, which have been judged almoſt impoſſible to be raiſed in <hi>England.</hi>" <hi>Phil.

By this method, he ſucceeded with all the hard-ſhelled fruits and ſeeds. He inſtances the Cocoa Nut; the Bonduc, or Nickar Tree (<hi>Guilandina Bonduc</hi> Lin.); the <hi>Abrus precatorius;</hi> the Horſe Eye Bean (<hi>Dolichos urens</hi>); and ſeveral others.</p>

               <p>In 1731, he publiſhed his "Gardener's Dictionary," in folio, which has paſſed through many ſucceſſive editions; in each of which it received ſuch improvements, and augmentations, as have rendered it in the end the moſt complete body of garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extant. It has been tranſlated into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious languages; and the reception it has every where met with, is a ſufficient proof of its ſuperiority. The new edition of it, now under the care of Profeſſor MARTYN, we doubt not, will extend to a late period, the reputation both of the author, and of the editor.</p>
               <p>In the ſame, or the ſucceeding year, he publiſhed "The Gardener's Kalender," in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>;

which has run through numerous edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and has been a manual, in its way, for the whole kingdom. To an edition of this work, in 1761, the author prefixed "A Short Introduction to the Knowledge of the Science of Botany;" in which he explains the <hi>Linnaean</hi> terms of art, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates the characters of the claſſes in five copper-plates.

               <p>Mr. MILLER held an extenſive corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with perſons in diſtant parts of the globe. From the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> from <hi>Siberia,</hi> from <hi>North America,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, by means of Dr. <hi>William</hi> HOUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, from the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> his garden, for a long ſeries of years, received a plentiful and perpetual ſupply of rare, and frequently of new ſpecies, which his ſucceſsful culture ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom failed to preſerve. It was the remark of foreigners, that <hi>Chelſea</hi> exhibited the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of both the <hi>Indies.</hi> Theſe advantages enabled MILLER to execute, what it was in the power of few to attempt—His "Figures of Plants, adapted to his Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary," which he began to publiſh in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0179600402:254"/>
numbers in 1755, and which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted in 300 tables, making two volumes in folio, in 1760, were drawn from plants of his own garden. His original deſign was very extenſive; no leſs than to give one, or more ſpecies, of all the genera: but it was found to be impracticable; and it was therefore confined to ſuch as were the moſt beautiful, uſeful, and uncommon. Each number was accompanied with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pages of letter-preſs, containing the deſcriptions, and an account of the claſſes to which they belong, according to the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of RAY, TOURNEFORT, and LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS. As this work is well known, I ſhall only obſerve, that whether we conſider the rarity of the ſubjects, the ſpeciouſneſs of thoſe he ſelected for his purpoſe, or the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral execution of the whole, <hi>England</hi> had not before produced any work, except the <hi>Hortus Elthamenſis,</hi> and CATESBY's <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> ſo ſuperb and extenſive.

               <p>Theſe letters relate to a diſcovery made by the Abbé MAZEAS, and the Abbé SAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAGES, on the black ſtaining quality of three ſeveral ſpecies of <hi>American</hi> Sumach. Neither the lixivium of wood aſhes, nor boiling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſoap, had any effect in weakening the tinge made by the juices of theſe plants. They were, 1.

(Rhus Toxicoden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum). 3. <hi>Toxicodendrum triphyllum glabrum</hi> (Rhus radicans). Mr. MILLER conſiders the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0179600402:257"/>
Abbe's diſcovery as having been long before anticipated by KAEMPFER; and adduces many reaſons to prove, that the <hi>Sitzdſiu,</hi> or <hi>Arbor vernicifera legitima,</hi> p. 791. fig. 792. of that author, or the Varniſh Tree of <hi>Japan,</hi> is no other than the firſt of theſe ſpecies, of which the ſtaining quality is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by KAEMPFER.

               <p>IT is a ſingular fact, that phyſic is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for the moſt complete ſet of figures of the medicinal plants, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and induſtry of a lady, exerted on an occaſion that redounded highly to her praiſe.</p>
               <p>The name of Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> BLACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL is well known, both from her own
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0179600402:259"/>
merit, and the fate of her unfortunate huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who, condemned for crimes of ſtate, ſuffered death on the ſcaffold in <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the year 1747.</p>
               <p>We are informed, ſhe was the daughter of a merchant in the neighbourhood of <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> of which city Dr. <hi>Alexander</hi> BLACKWELL, her huſband, was a native, and where he received an univerſity educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was early diſtinguiſhed for his claſſical knowledge. By ſome, he is ſaid only to have aſſumed the title of Doctor, after his ſucceſsful attendance on the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> but I believe, the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account is, that of his having taken the degree of Doctor of Phyſic under BOER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAAVE at <hi>Leyden.</hi> After having failed in his attempt to introduce himſelf into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, firſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>London,</hi> he became corrector to a printing preſs, and ſoon after commenced printer himſelf. But being proſecuted by the trade, and at length involved in debt, was thrown into priſon. To relieve theſe diſtreſſes, Mrs. BLACKWELL, having a genius for drawing and painting, exerted all her talents; and,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0179600402:260"/>
underſtanding that an Herbal of Medicinal Plants was greatly wanted, ſhe exhibited to Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, Dr. MEAD, and other phyſicians, ſome ſpecimens of her art in painting plants, who approved ſo highly of them, as to encourage her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a work, by the profits of which ſhe is ſaid to have procured her huſband's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, after a confinement of two years.</p>
               <p>Mr. RAND, an eminent apothecary, was at that time Demonſtrator to the Company of Apothecaries, in the Garden at <hi>Chelſea.</hi> By his advice ſhe took up her reſidence op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite the Phyſic Garden, in order to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate her deſign, by receiving the plants as freſh as poſſible. He not only promoted her work with the public, but, together with Mr. <hi>Philip</hi> MILLER, afforded her all poſſible direction and aſſiſtance in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. After ſhe had completed the drawings, ſhe engraved them on copper, and coloured the prints with her own hands.</p>
               <p>During her abode at <hi>Chelſea,</hi> ſhe was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited by perſons of quality, and many ſcientific people, who admired her
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0179600402:261"/>
performances, and patronized her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
               <p>On publiſhing the firſt volume, in 1737, ſhe obtained a recommendation from Dr. MEAD, Dr. SHERARD, Mr. RAND, and others, to be prefixed to it. And being allowed to preſent, in perſon, a copy to the College of Phyſicians, that body made her a preſent, and gave her a public teſtimonial of their approbation; with leave to prefix it to her book. The ſecond volume was finiſhed in 1739, and the whole publiſhed under the following title:</p>
               <p>"A curious Herbal, containing 500 Cuts of the moſt uſeful Plants which are now uſed in the Practice of Phyſic, engraved on folio copper-plates, after drawings taken from the life. By ELIZABETH BLACKWELL. To which is added, a ſhort Deſcription of the Plants, and their common Uſes in Phyſic. 1739." 2 vol. fol.</p>
               <p>The drawings are in general faithful; and if there is wanting that accuracy, which modern improvements have rendered neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in delineating the more minute parts,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0179600402:262"/>
yet, upon the whole, the figures are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſtinctive of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Each plate is accompanied with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved page, containing the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> officinal names, followed by a ſhort deſcription of the plant, and a ſummary of its qualities, and uſes. After theſe occur the name in various other languages. Theſe illuſtrations were the ſhare her huſband took in the work. This ill-fated man, after his failure in phyſic, and in printing, became an unſucceſsful candidate for the place of Secretary to the Society for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning. He was made Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant of the Works belonging to the <hi>Duke of</hi> CHANDOS at <hi>Cannons,</hi> and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced thoſe diſappointments incident to projectors. He formed ſchemes in agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and wrote a treatiſe on the ſubject, which, we are told, was the cauſe of his being engaged in <hi>Sweden.</hi> In that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he drained marſhes, practiſed phyſic, and was even employed in that capacity for the king. At length he was involved in ſome ſtate cabals, or, as ſome accounts have it, in a plot with <hi>Count</hi> TESSIN, for which
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0179600402:263"/>
he loſt his life, proteſting his innocence to the laſt.</p>
               <p>So reſpectable a performance as Mrs. BLACKWELL's, attracted the attention of phyſicians on the continent. TREW, of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> in the year 1750, engaged an artiſt of that place to copy Mrs. BLACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL's plates, and himſelf ſupplied ſeveral defects in the drawings. He ſubſtituted ſome entirely new figures in the room of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, very conſiderably reformed and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified the text, tranſlated it into <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and planned the addition of a ſixth century of plates. He prefixed a moſt elaborate and learned Catalogue of Botani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authors, but did not live to finiſh the work. The Fifth Century was publiſhed in 1765; and Dr. TREW dying in 1769, the ſupplemental volume, exhibiting plants omitted by Mrs. BLACKWELL, articles newly introduced into practice, and figures of the poiſonous ſpecies, was conducted by LUDWIG, BOSE, and BOEHMER, and printed in 1773. Thus reformed, TREW's edition ſurpaſſes any other work of the ſame deſign. If there are imperfections in it,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0179600402:264"/>
they were unavoidable, ariſing from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of procuring recent ſpecimens in ſome inſtances, and from an almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ignorance of the origin of others, defects ſtill unſupplied in various articles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> DEERING was a native of <hi>Saxony:</hi> He took his degrees in phyſic at <hi>Leyden;</hi> and, as Mr. MARTYN informs us, came to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> firſt, in the train of a foreign ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. This happened, I conjecture, before, or about the year 1720. He practiſed phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and midwifery in <hi>London;</hi> and having a ſtrong bias to the ſtudy of botany, became one of the members of the ſociety eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Dr. DILLENIUS and Mr. MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TYN, which ſubſiſted from the year 1721 to 1726.</p>
               <p>In the year 1736, he removed to <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> under the recommendation of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE. At this time he was married; but his wife did not long ſurvive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval to that place. He was at firſt well received; and is ſaid to have been very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in his treatment of the ſmall-pox,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0179600402:265"/>
which diſeaſe was highly epidemical at that place, ſoon after his ſettling there. But he incurred the cenſure of the faculty, by his pretenſions to a noſtrum. He publiſhed "An Account of an improved Method of treating the Small-pox, in a Letter to Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> PARKYNS, Bart." 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1737. pp. 52. By this tract it appears, that his medicine was of the antiphlogiſtic kind, and his regimen the cool one, which at that time had been adopted by very few, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice.</p>
               <p>Dr. DEERING ſhewed his attachment to his botanical purſuits, by his aſſiduity in collecting ſuch ample materials for his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue in leſs than two years after fixing at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> He publiſhed it under the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing title:</p>
               <p>"A CATALOGUE OF PLANTS naturally growing and commonly cultivated in divers Parts of <hi>England,</hi> more eſpecially about <hi>Nottingham:</hi> containing the moſt known <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Names of the ſeveral Plants; the Tribe they belong to; the Time of their flowering; and of thoſe which are either Officinals or otherwiſe,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0179600402:266"/>
of any known Efficacy, ſuch Virtues are briefly mentioned as may be depended upon. To which is added, a general Diſtribution of Plants according to Mr. RAY; with an Explanation of ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical and phyſical Terms; and an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabetical Liſt of Plants in Flower, for every Month in the Year. By <hi>Charles</hi> DEERING, <hi>M.D. Nottingham.</hi>" 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1738. pp. 264.</p>
               <p>The arrangement is alphabetical, and the number of plants about 850. The author was particularly attached to the ſubjects of the <hi>Cryptogamia</hi> claſs, in which his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches had been very ſucceſsful. Of the number above mentioned, more than 200 belonged to the orders of <hi>Fungi, Muſci,</hi> and <hi>Algae;</hi> among which, we meet with 27 which he conſidered as <hi>nondeſcripts,</hi> and 10 others not to be met with in the third edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of RAY's <hi>Synopſis.</hi> He was aſſiſted in this branch by his correſpondence with the learned Profeſſor at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who conſidered ſome of his diſcoveries as new, and ſpeaks of his knowledge and aſſiduity in terms of applauſe. In page 89 of his poſthumous
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0179600402:267"/>
work, the <hi>Nottinghamia Vetus et Nova,</hi> there occurs a liſt of ſome plants, diſcovered by the author after the publication of this Catalogue. Theſe are principally of the <hi>Cryptogamous</hi> kind. Several of the more rare plants of the environs eſcaped the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this aſſiduous man; among which may be mentioned particularly, that moſt virulent of all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the <hi>Cicuta viroſa,</hi> or, long-leaved Water Hemlock; which I remember to have ſeen growing in the <hi>Leen,</hi> near the <hi>Rock-holes,</hi> in <hi>Nottingham</hi> Park. That the <hi>Addenda</hi> to his "Catalogue" were not more copious may be attributed to his ſubſequent misfortunes, which undoubtedly damped the ardour of his purſuit.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding his early ſucceſs, that <q rend="inline">"adverſe fatality,"</q> which he himſelf alludes to in his "Letter on the Small-pox," ſtill attended him. He was, unhappily, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with that degree of prudence, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quanimity of temper, which are ſo neceſſary to the practice of phyſic; inſomuch, that he very early loſt the little intereſt which his character and ſucceſs had at firſt gained.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0179600402:268"/>
But as I would rather dwell on his merits, than on his failings, I ſhall obſerve, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his acquaintance with the antient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, he was maſter of many of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern tongues. His knowledge of that ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which gives him a place in this ſketch, was very conſiderable, and will be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, ſo long as DILLENIUS's "Hiſtory" ſhall preſerve eſtimation. He had a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of deſigning, and was an ingenious mechanic. After his failure in Phyſic, his friends attempted ſeveral ſchemes to alleviate his neceſſities. They procured him, among others, a commiſſion in the regiment raiſed at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> on account of the rebellion. But this proved more honourable than profitable to him. He was afterwards em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a way more agreeable to his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and talents; being furniſhed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and enabled by the aſſiſtance of <hi>John</hi> PLUMTREE, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and others, to write the Hiſtory of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which he dedicated to the <hi>Duke of</hi> NEWCASTLE. But he did not live to receive the reward of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. He had been troubled with the gout at a very early period, having been afflicted
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0179600402:269"/>
with it in his nineteenth year, and in the latter ſtage of his life, he ſuffered long confinements in this diſeaſe, and became aſthmatical. Being at length reduced to a degree of poverty, and dependance, which his ſpirit could not ſuſtain, oppreſſed with calamity, and complicated diſeaſe, he died April 12, 1749. Two of his principal cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors adminiſtered to his effects, and buried him in <hi>St. Peter's</hi> church-yard, oppoſite the houſe in which he reſided.</p>
               <p>He left an <hi>Hortus Siccus</hi> of the plants of his "Catalogue," conſiſting of upwards of 600 ſpecies, in eight volumes, of the quarto form; beſides ſeparate tables of the <hi>Moſſes,</hi> and a volume of paintings of the <hi>Fungi,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately done by his own hand. Some part, if not the whole, of this collection, was, I believe, purchaſed by the Honourable <hi>Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> WILLOUGHBY, who had been one of his benefactors, while living, and inherited a portion of that taſte, which diſtinguiſhed his family in the time of Mr. RAY.

               <p>The ſubject of this article, like <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> WILLISEL, and <hi>Samuel</hi> BREWER, is another inſtance of that unconquerable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to a favourite branch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which ſometimes engroſſes the minds of thoſe, who, by their lot, have not been exempted from labouring in the lower, and mechanical offices of life.</p>
               <p>From information which I received, more than twenty years ago, concerning <hi>John</hi> WILSON, I learned that he was originally an inhabitant of <hi>Kendal,</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland;</hi> and was employed in the manufacture of knit ſtockings, for which that town was ſo famous. That, at one time, he gave weekly
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0179600402:272"/>
leſſons on botany, alternately, at that place, and at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> That many pupils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him from the neighbouring parts of <hi>Scotland;</hi> inſomuch, that in ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he received ſixty pounds a year, as the premium of his labours.</p>
               <p>I muſt not, however, omit to obſerve, that this account does not coincide with another, which I have ſince met with in the "<hi>Britiſh</hi> Topography;" the reſpectable author of which informs us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON was a ſhoemaker, and by his intenſe application to his favourite ſtudy, lived moſt of his life in a ſtate of indigence. A cow, of which his wife had the care, was the ſole ſupport of his family: and ſuch was his infatuation, that he was once tempted to part with that moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful animal, to purchaſe MORISON's vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous work, had not a neighbouring lady preſented him with the book, and reſcued the poor man and his family from beggary and ruin."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this repreſentation of WILSON's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, while men of ſympathizing minds,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0179600402:273"/>
and ſimilar taſte, muſt deplore that hard fate which reduced him to ſuch neceſſity, they muſt yet more ſtrongly cenſure a raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which could tempt him to riſk, in ſo eſſential a manner, the welfare of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>As WILSON exhibited to the public, a ſingular proof of his knowledge in this his principal object, I am inclined to believe, that he muſt, originally, either have had ſome grammar education, or, impelled by his genius, muſt afterwards have acquired a knowledge of the <hi>Latin</hi> language. How elſe (except on the ſuppoſition of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſſiſtance, of which I have no informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) could he have made uſe of MORISON's "Hiſtory," or have tranſlated RAY's <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſis!</hi> In 1744, he publiſhed "A SY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOPSIS OF BRITISH PLANTS in Mr. RAY's METHOD; with their Characters, Deſcriptions, Places of Growth, Time of Flowering, and phyſical Virtues, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt accurate Obſervations, and the beſt modern Authors; together with a Botanical Dictionary, illuſtrated
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0179600402:274"/>
with ſeveral Figures. By <hi>John</hi> WILSON. <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tyne.</hi>" 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1744. pp. 272.</p>
               <p>Throughout this work, the author has prefixed copious characters to each genus, taken, as it appears, from RAY and TOURNE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORT; into many of which, in conformity to RAY's method, he introduces the form of the leaves, and the habit of the plant. By this means, having added, in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſhort deſcriptions of the ſpecies, his book was an uſeful pocket manual, as far as it extended; for he begins with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary plants, and ends with the Bulbous rooted. He ſubjoins the particular places of the rare plants in the northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> from his own obſervations, and, partly from a manuſcript of Mr. LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON's. His remarks on the properties and virtues, additional to thoſe from RAY, he has principally extracted from MILLER's "<hi>Botanicum Officinale.</hi>"</p>
               <p>WILSON has made ſome tranſpoſitions in the diſtribution of his ſubjects in this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, which prove that he had attentively examined plants, and was well acquainted
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0179600402:275"/>
with the ſyſtem of RAY. Some of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations will ſtand the teſt of modern accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, though others may be leſs happy.</p>
               <p>He has placed all the ſpecies of the <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> genus together, in the <hi>Papilionaceous</hi> claſs; and, agreeably to the hint which DILLENIUS gives in the <hi>Synopſis,</hi> p. 316, has referred the <hi>Plantains,</hi> and <hi>Sponges,</hi> to the <hi>Monopetalous</hi> flowers ſucceeded by dry ſeed veſſels. The removal of the <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae ſiliquoſae,</hi> the two <hi>Papavera corniculata,</hi> the <hi>Chelidonium,</hi> and the <hi>Balſamine,</hi> to the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquoſe</hi> or Tetradynamous claſs of LINNAEUS, is leſs to be approved. By theſe changes, he has nearly annihilated RAY's twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecond claſs of <hi>Britiſh</hi> herbs. In tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of ſpecies, he has made more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous alterations; ſome of which are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently juſtified by modern improvements. Thus he has brought under one genus the <hi>Scordium</hi> and <hi>Scorodonia.</hi> He has referred the <hi>Raphanus ruſticanus</hi> to the <hi>Cochlearia</hi> genus, as TOURNEFORT had done. The <hi>Chelidonium</hi> genus is ſeparated from the <hi>Papaver,</hi> and a new characteriſtic note framed, but the name <hi>Papaver corniculatum</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0179600402:276"/>
preſerved. The only two plants met with in this book, which do not occur in the <hi>Synopſis</hi> of RAY, are ſuch as have a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful title to the appellation of indigenous: they are the <hi>Valeriana rubra,</hi> and <hi>Allium Schaenopraſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe he died about the year 1750, or ſoon after. He left the remaining part of his work, on the <hi>Graminaceous</hi> and <hi>Cryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togamous</hi> tribes, compleat in manuſcript. In the year 1762, a perſon of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> into whoſe hands the manuſcript had paſſed, meditated the publication of it, with a new edition of the work now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which was out of print, and much called for; but the deſign never took effect.</p>

The <hi>Loci natales,</hi> or, as ſome modern botaniſts quaintly ſpeak, the <hi>Habitats,</hi> of a great number of the ſubjects in this little work, were communicated by the friends and correſpondents of the author; of whom, as they hereby contributed to enlarge the bounds of <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany, it is but juſt to record their names.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the author was ſupplied with a great number by Mr. THORNBECK, a ſurgeon and expert botaniſt, at <hi>Ingleton,</hi> a ſpot rich in the choiceſt objects of a curious obſerver.

               <p>In this volume, Mr. BLACKSTONE has introduced a few plants, not before record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as natives of this iſland: ſuch are, the <hi>Epimedium alpinum; Ariſtolochia Clematitis; Limonium reticulatum; Fritillaria Meleagris;</hi> and <hi>Dentaria bulbifera.</hi> Subſequent authors have not allowed complete naturalization to the <hi>Epimedium,</hi> and probably that of ſome of the others is but of modern date.

               </p>
               <p>The author intended another volume of the <hi>Specimen,</hi> for which he had collected materials.

The "<hi>Specimen Botanicum</hi>" of Mr. BLACKSTONE, I conſider as the laſt book publiſhed in <hi>England,</hi> on the indigenous botany, before the ſyſtem of LINNAEUS had gained the aſcendancy over that of RAY: nor, unleſs it were within my plan to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſingle papers, occaſionally printed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> or in other collections, am I able to mention any work of importance on exotic botany, before this revolution took place, which was not built upon, or at leaſt did not exhibit ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of, the new ſyſtem. Whilſt this event was taking place, which cannot be computed at fewer than twenty years, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing from 1740, there were, however, ſeveral eminent and learned men, who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did not diſtinguiſh themſelves by publiſhing ſeparate tracts on the ſcience, were occaſionally improving it, by their

               <p>The queſtion concerning the cauſe of the black colour of the ſkin in Negroes, has exerciſed the pens of many philoſophers and anatomiſts. What has perplexed the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the more is, that theſe ingenious wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (among whom are principally <hi>Malpighi, Boyle, Winſlow, Meckel,</hi> and <hi>Barrere</hi>) have differed about matters of fact that ſhould ſeem to be cognizable by the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>It would be improper in this work to purſue the learned author through all his ingenious details and curious <hi>ſcholia</hi> on this ſubject; it muſt be ſufficient to obſerve, that, on the <hi>Newtonian</hi> doctrine of the cauſes of colours, he deduces the colour of the ſkin of Negroes from the ſtructure, after eſtabliſhing certain propoſitions: 1. That the colour of White People proceeds from the colour which the <hi>epidermis</hi> tranſmits. 2. That the denſity of the ſkins of Negroes allows of no tranſmiſſion of colour. 3. The
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0179600402:287"/>
part of the ſkin which appears black in Negroes, is the <hi>corpus reticulare cutis,</hi> and external <hi>lamella</hi> of the <hi>epidermis.</hi> 4. That the colour does not proceed from any black humour or fluid parts contained in their ſkins. 5. That the <hi>epidermis,</hi> eſpecially its external <hi>lamella,</hi> is divided into two parts, by its pores and ſcales, 200 times leſs than the particles of bodies, on which their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours depend. Hence Dr. MITCHELL con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <q rend="inline">"that the proximate cauſe of the colour of Negroes is threefold; <hi>viz.</hi> the opacity of their ſkins, proceeding from the thickneſs and denſity of the texture, which obſtructs the tranſmiſſion of the rays of light from the white and red parts below them; together with their greater refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, which abſorbs thoſe rays; and the ſmallneſs of the particles of their ſkins, which hinder them to reflect any light."</q> After which, he diſcourſes on the influence of the ſun, and the modes of life among the inhabitants of hot countries, as the remote cauſes of the colour of Negroes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</p>

               <p>AMONG the various contingencies which favoured the introduction of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem into <hi>England,</hi> it is not unimportant to mention the effect of the admirable pencil of the late Mr. EHRET. This ingenious artiſt brought with him, not only a general taſte for botany, but a particular knowledge of the principles, on which the ſyſtem of LINNAEUS was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and was among the firſt who diſplayed it, in the ſpecimens of his art.</p>
               <p>The father of <hi>George Dyoniſius</hi> EHRET was gardener to the Prince of <hi>Baden Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince of <hi>Baden Durlach,</hi> was a patron of botany, and his garden was famous at that time. He ſent his principal ſuperintendant of the garden, on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate expedition with HEBENSTREIT, into <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </note>. <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0179600402:292"/>
 Young EHRET very early ſhewed a taſte for drawing, and painting the flowers of the garden. And although he received no inſtructions, yet ſuch was his proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that, whilſt a very young man, he had painted 500 plants with a ſkill and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that was almoſt unexampled, under the diſadvantages of ſo total a want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as our young artiſt had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced. His merit, however, remained long unknown, or at leaſt ineffectually noticed, until it was diſcovered by a gentleman of curioſity and judgment, who viſited the garden, of which his father was the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant. Fortunately for young EHRET, this ſtranger was a phyſician and a friend of the celebrated Dr. TREW, of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> to whom he juſtly ſuppoſed theſe paintings would be acceptable. EHRET by this means was introduced to TREW, who immediately purchaſed the whole 500 paintings, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly gave him double the price at which the young artiſt had modeſtly valued them.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0179600402:293"/>
The liberality of TREW, by which EHRET put 4000 florins into his pocket, inſpired him with confidence in his own abilities, and ſuch a ſhare of ambition as inclined him to quit his home, and ſeek at once to raiſe his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and to gratify the deſire he had to ſee the world. It appears that he was too much elated with his ſucceſs; and, as the effect of ſome ſhare of vanity, and a want of oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy not unuſual in young men, he ſoon diſſipated this ſum, and, in queſt of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, went to <hi>Baſil,</hi> with the laſt, and thoſe only a few, of his florins in his pocket. Here, ſhutting himſelf up, he, with great diligence, and ſingular exertion, ſtimulated now by preſſing neceſſity, ſoon exhibited numerous ſpecimens of his art; and, though he had learned to ſet a higher value upon them, found a demand beyond his induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſupply. Having thus recruited his finances, he journeyed into <hi>France,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided ſome time at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> where he taught his art to a lady of fortune, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him generouſly, and, on his wiſh to remove, paid his expences to <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> At the latter city he became known to JUSSIEU, and was for ſome time employed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0179600402:294"/>
to paint the plants of the Royal Garden, under that eminent Profeſſor's inſpection. After a certain time, he exchanged his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation at <hi>Paris,</hi> for that of <hi>London;</hi> but not ſucceeding to his mind, he ſoon returned to the continent. The preciſe time of his being firſt in <hi>England,</hi> I cannot aſcertain; but it was, I conjecture, before his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the garden of Mr. CLIFFORD, where LINNAEUS found him in the year 1736. From LINNAEUS himſelf he was taught attention to the parts of the flower, and hence became early inſtructed in the principles of the ſexual ſyſtem. His fine taſte, and botanical accuracy, were, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, firſt publicly manifeſted in the figures of the <hi>Hortus Cliſſortianus,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1737; and, from that time, EH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RET became ſtrongly attached to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Swede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He returned to <hi>England</hi> about the year 1740, or ſoon after that period: and here he ſpent the remainder of his days. His firſt patron in this country was <hi>Taylor</hi> WHITE, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for whom he finiſhed 300 paintings of plants. He ſoon after procured the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of Dr. MEAD, for whom he painted
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0179600402:295"/>
200, and who generouſly advanced his price. In conſequence of this countenance and protection, he obtained encouragement from Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, and many other opulent lovers of his art. Dr. FOTHERGILL pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured large collections from him; and the late eminent patroneſs of natural hiſtory, the <hi>Ducheſs of</hi> PORTLAND, poſſeſſed, beſides near 300 paintings of exotics, upwards of 500 of <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants, done on vellum, and highly finiſhed, by this admirable artiſt.</p>
               <p>Another of his patrons, and to whoſe obliging information I owe great part of the foregoing anecdotes relating to him, was <hi>Ralph</hi> WILLETT, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Merly,</hi> in <hi>Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> at whoſe ſeat Mr. EHRET was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, for many years, to ſpend ſeveral weeks in the ſummer ſeaſon, and in whoſe friendſhip Mr. EHRET repoſed, as executor in the laſt arrangement of his affairs. The library at <hi>Merly</hi> exhibits a copious collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of exotics, done by EHRET: not fewer than 230 finiſhed ſpecimens on vellum; beſides ſeventy on paper; and more than 500 in an unfiniſhed ſtate.</p>
               <p>The firſt publiſhed ſpecimens of his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, after his ſettlement in <hi>England,</hi> that I
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0179600402:296"/>
am acquainted with, were exhibited in the 44th volume of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 478. for January and February 1746; by the figure of the <hi>Keratophyton flabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme</hi> of RAY (Gorgonia verrucoſa <hi>Lin.</hi>) for a paper written by Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE: and by two excellent figures of the <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanthe erocata,</hi> and <hi>Cieuta viroſa,</hi> in the ſame volume, intended to illuſtrate Mr. WATSON's obſervations on the fatal Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of thoſe Plants.</p>
               <p>Very early after his arrival in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he began to paint figures of the rareſt products of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gardens, for his friend and firſt patron Dr. TREW; for whom, in the end, he finiſhed 300. Of theſe, at different periods, 100 were engraved, and publiſhed in <hi>Decads,</hi> under the following title:</p>
               <p>"PLANTAE SELECTAE, <hi>quarum Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines ad exemplaria naturalia Londini in hortis curioſorum nutrita, manu artificioſa pinxit Georgius Dionyſius</hi> EHRET, <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, collegit nominibus notiſque illuſtravit Chr.

               <p>The only publication of any importance in <hi>England,</hi> in which Mr. EHRET was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged throughout, as far as I can find, was BROWN's "Natural Hiſtory of <hi>Jamaica,</hi>" printed in 1756, for which he drew all the figures, amounting to 40 tables. As they were principally taken from prepared and dried ſpecimens, they cannot be numbered among his capital performances.</p>
               <p>Mr. EHRET drew, and himſelf engraved, a ſet of tables of Exotics, two or three on each plate, to the number of fifteen; each table containing alſo a Butterfly of exotic origin.

Whilſt, therefore, juſtice to his character and attainments, in the ſubject of this work, demand conſideration, I feel an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional motive to pay a tribute to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ariſing from a grateful remembrance of the friendſhip and correſpondence with which he honoured me.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON was born in 1715, in <hi>St. John's Street,</hi> near <hi>Smithſield.</hi> His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a reputable tradeſman in that ſtreet, and died, leaving him very young. When he had attained to a proper age, he was ſent to Merchant Taylor's School; and from thence was apprenticed to Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> apothecary, in 1730.</p>
               <p>In his youth he had a ſtrong propenſity to the ſtudy of natural hiſtory, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to that of plants. This led him to make frequent excurſions in a morning, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miles from <hi>London;</hi> ſo that he became early well acquainted with the <hi>Loci natales</hi> of the indigenous plants of the environs of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0179600402:304"/>
                  <hi>London;</hi> and, during his apprenticeſhip, he gained the honorary premium given annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Apothecaries Company, to ſuch young men as exhibit a ſuperiority in the knowledge of plants, in thoſe excurſions made by the Demonſtrator of <hi>Chelſea</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and inſtituted for the purpoſe of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating the apprentices of the Company in a ſcience ſo neceſſary to the profeſſion. This premium, as hath been obſerved in the courſe of the preceding pages, conſiſted of a handſomely bound copy of RAY's <hi>Synopſis.</hi> He continued, at times, throughout his life, to attend on theſe occaſions, and meet his former aſſociates with great pleaſure and delight.</p>
               <p>In 1738, Mr. WATSON married, and ſet up in buſineſs for himſelf. His ſkill, his activity, and diligence in his profeſſion, ſoon diſtinguiſhed him among his acquaintance; as did his taſte for natural hiſtory, and his general knowledge of philoſophical ſubjects among the members of the Royal Society, of which honourable body he was elected a member early in the year 1741; his two firſt communications being printed in the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0179600402:305"/>
41ſt volume of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after his admiſſion into the Royal Society, Mr. WATSON diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a botaniſt. His earlieſt paper on this ſubject was, "An Account of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated HALLER's <hi>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</hi> extracted from the <hi>Latin,</hi> and illuſtrated with a <hi>Conſpectus</hi> of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's method, and with various obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations." This was printed in the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Tranſactions</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Vol. xlii. p. 369-80.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the ſame volume<note n="b" place="bottom">p. 599.</note>, and in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding<note n="c" place="bottom">Vol. xliii. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 473. p. 51.</note>, he excited the attention of the curious in this way, by ſome "Critical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Rev. Mr. PICKERING's Paper concerning the Seeds of Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms," which, that gentleman having ſeen a ſhort time before, conſidered as a new diſcovery; whereas Mr. WATSON ſhewed, that they had been demonſtrated ſeveral years prior to that period, by M. MICHELI, in his "<hi>Nova Plantarum Genera,</hi>" printed at <hi>Florence</hi> in 1729.</p>

               <p>In the ſame volume are inſerted ſome very inſtructive obſervations on the <hi>Cicuta,</hi> or Common Hemlock; occaſioned by the death of two of the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſoldiers, quartered at <hi>Waltham Abbey,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in conſequence of their having eaten this herb inſtead of Greens<note n="e" place="bottom">Ibid.

               <p>The death of two of the <hi>French</hi> priſoners in 1746, occaſioned by their eating the roots of the <hi>Hemlock Dropwort,</hi> produced from Mr. WATSON a paper, which in an eminent manner exemplified his ſkill in the knowledge of plants. It abounds with curious and critical obſervations on that plant, and on the <hi>Sium Erucae folio</hi> of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par</hi> BAUHINE (Cicuta viroſa <hi>Lin.</hi>) with which it had been frequently confounded;

               <p>In the 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi> volume of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> is printed a Tranſlation, by Mr. WATSON, of a Letter to Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, from Dr. GARCIN, of <hi>Neuchatel,</hi> containing a complete hiſtory of the <hi>Cypreſs</hi> of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; the <hi>Henna,</hi> or <hi>Alcanna</hi> of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> called by LINNAEUS <hi>Lawſonia inermis;</hi> a Shrub, famous for its uſe, both in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and as a dye, all over the Eaſt, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the duty on this drug amounts to 18,000 ducats annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note n="g" place="bottom">Ib.

               <p>In 1748, Mr. WATSON had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſhewing attention to M. KALM, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his abode in <hi>England,</hi> which was from February till Auguſt, when he embarked for <hi>America.</hi> He introduced him to the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gardens, and accompanied him in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral botanical excurſions in the environs of <hi>London.</hi> This eminent pupil of LINNAEUS,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0179600402:308"/>
who was a <hi>Swediſh</hi> divine, on his return home, became Profeſſor of Oeconomy at <hi>Abo,</hi> where he died Nov. 16, 1779, aged 63.</p>
               <p>The ſame civilities were manifeſted by Dr. WATSON to the preſent eminent Dr. PALLAS, of <hi>Peterſburgh,</hi> during his abode in <hi>England,</hi> which was from July 1761, to April 1762.</p>
               <p>In 1749, in company with Dr. MIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHELL, Mr. WATSON examined the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the garden, formerly belonging to the TRADESCANTS; of whom, ſee chap. 14. of this work. They found the <hi>Arbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and the <hi>Cupreſſus Americana,</hi> with other exotics, in a vigorous ſtate, after having ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the winters of this climate for 120 years. This ſituation had alſo afforded a proof, not often exemplified, of the large ſize to which the <hi>Common Buck-Thorn</hi> will grow.

               <p>In 1751, were laid before the public, ſome very curious and intereſting particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, relating to the ſexes of plants, which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0179600402:309"/>
tended to confirm the truth of that doctrine in a remarkable manner. Theſe were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a letter from Mr. MYLINS, of <hi>Berlin,</hi> informing Mr. WATSON, that a tree of the <hi>Palma major foliis flabelliformibus,</hi> which, although it had borne fruit for 30 years paſt, had never brought any to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, until the flowers of a male-tree, brought from <hi>Leipſic,</hi> 20 <hi>German</hi> miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, had been ſuſpended over its branches. After this operation, the tree yielded, the firſt year, above 100, and the ſecond, upon repeating the experiment, above 2000 ripe fruit; from which 11 young Palm-trees had been propagated<note n="i" place="bottom">

               <p>In the ſame volume are ſome remarks on the caſe of two women in <hi>Brabant,</hi> who had been nearly poiſoned by eating the leaves of what had been called <hi>White Henbane;</hi> but Mr. WATSON proved, that it muſt have been the <hi>Hyoſeyamas niger,</hi> ſince the <hi>white</hi> does not grow ſpontaneouſly in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

Mr. WATSON paid the ſame tribute, in 1751, to the memory of Dr. <hi>Henry</hi> COMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the friend and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Mr. RAY, as he had done to that of the TRADESCANTS; and gives a liſt of 33 exotic trees, which were then remaining in the garden at <hi>Fulham.</hi> From this cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue may be inferred, not only the original ſplendour of the garden, and the zeal and taſte the Biſhop ſhewed in the cultivation of ſuch numerous curioſities, but the facility with which trees of very different latitudes may become naturalized in <hi>England</hi>

               <p>In the ſame volume, page 301, we find "An Account of the Cinnamon Tree;" occaſioned by a large ſpecimen, equal in ſize to a walking cane, ſent over by Mr. ROBINS to Dr. LETHERLAND, and which was exhibited to the inſpection of the Royal Society. From this Account we learn, that three Cinnamon Trees, which were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been ſent to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> were grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the garden of <hi>Hampton Court</hi> in the reign of King <hi>William.</hi>

In the year 1752, Mr. WATSON laid before the Royal Society two rare <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants; the <hi>Lathraea Squamaria,</hi> and the <hi>Dentaria bulbifera:</hi> the latter unnoticed both by Mr. RAY and DILLENIUS. Theſe were diſcovered by Mr. BLACKSTONE, near <hi>Harefield</hi>

               <p>Mr. WATSON, about this time, was the firſt, as I apprehend, who communicated to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader, an Account of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution which was about to take place among the learned, in Botany and Zoolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, reſpecting the removal of a large body of marine productions, which had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ranked among vegetables; but which were now proved to be of animal origin, and ſtand under the name of Zoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytes, in the preſent <hi>Syſtem of Nature.</hi> It
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0179600402:312"/>
may be eaſily ſeen that this reſpects the Corals, Corallines, <hi>Eſcharae,</hi> Madrepores, Sponges, &amp;c. and although even GESNER, IMPERATUS, and RUMPHIUS, had ſome obſcure ideas relating to the dubious ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this claſs, yet the full diſcovery, that theſe ſubſtances were the fabrications of Polypes, was owing to M. PEYSSONNEL, phyſician at <hi>Guadaloupe.</hi> This gentleman had imbibed this opinion firſt, in 1723, at <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> and confirmed it, in 1725, on the coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi> While in <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe,</hi> he wrote a volume of 400 pages in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. in proof of this ſubject, which he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in manuſcript to the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of <hi>London.</hi> This treatiſe, in which the author ſeemed to have put the matter out of doubt, as to the animal origin of theſe bodies, was tranſlated, analyzed, and abridged, in 1752, by Mr. WATSON; and publiſhed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="bottom">Vol. xlvii. p. 445-469.</note>, at a time when the learned were wavering in their opinions on this matter. M. TREMBLY's inveſtigation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting

the Freſh Water Polypes had pav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way for the reception of PEYSSON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEL's truths; and Mr. WATSON himſelf, in company with M. TREMBLY, had an opportunity, on the coaſt of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> when on a viſit at the Duke of RICHMOND's, in one of thoſe annual excurſions<note n="p" place="bottom">It may gratify the curioſity of ſome, who reverence the name of Mr. RAY, to be informed, that in one of theſe excurſions, Dr. WATSON was led, by his reſpect to the memory of that great and good man, to viſit the ſpot where he had lived at <hi>Black Notley,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> This was in the year 1760. To Dr. WATSON this was claſſical ground. I was informed by him, at that time, that he found Mr. RAY's monument removed out of the church, where it formerly ſtood, into the church-yard, and hardly viſible for brambles: theſe he had removed while he ſtayed. That he found the houſe in a ſtate which indicated no alteration having taken place, except what more than half a century of time might be ſuppoſed neceſſarily to have occaſioned; unleſs that indeed ſome of the windows were ſtopped up to ſave the tax; and that the orchard bore all the appearance of being, as near as poſſible, in the ſtate in which it muſt have been in Mr. RAY's life-time. That the inhabitants of the village knew little of him; and the people of the houſe had only heard that he was a great traveller.</note> which for many years he ſeldom failed to make in the ſummer ſeaſon, of verifying M.

written in <hi>Latin;</hi> in which he takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to acknowledge the candour, and ſkill of the author, in high terms; and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf for having, in his work above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, given to the <hi>Meadia</hi> (a plant ſo called by CATESBY, in honour of Dr. MEAD) a different name.

               <p>Theſe talents, it may be eaſily imagined, rendered him a welcome viſitor to Sir
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0179600402:317"/>
                  <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, who had retired to <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> in 1740. In fact, he enjoyed no ſmall ſhare of the favour and eſteem of that veteran in ſcience; and was honoured ſo far, as to be nominated one of the Truſtees of the Britiſh Muſeum by Sir <hi>Hans</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who died Jan. 11, 1753.</p>
               <p>After its eſtabliſhment in <hi>Montagu Houſe,</hi> Mr. WATSON was very aſſiduous, not only in the internal arrangement of ſubjects, but alſo in getting the garden furniſhed with plants; inſomuch that, in the firſt year of its eſtabliſhment, in 1756, it contained no fewer than 600 ſpecies, all in a flouriſhing ſtate.</p>
               <p>Having given ample ſpecimens of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and abilities of Mr. WATSON, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt, we muſt now conſider his talents in ſome other branches of knowledge. Among theſe, nothing contributed ſo much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his fame, and enlarge his connexions with men of ſcience, as his diſcoveries in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0179600402:318"/>
electricity. He became early enamoured with the phaenomena of this wonderful agent in nature; an attention to which had been ſome time before excited, among the philoſophers of <hi>Europe;</hi> and particularly in <hi>England,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Stephen</hi> GRAY, of the Charter-Houſe; <hi>Granville</hi> WHELER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Dr. DESAGULIERS; and others.</p>
               <p>About the year 1744, Mr. WATSON took it up, and made ſeveral important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in it. At this time, it was no ſmall advancement in the progreſs of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity, to be able to fire ſpirit of wine. He was the firſt in <hi>England</hi> who effected this, and he performed it, both by the <hi>direct,</hi> and the <hi>repulſive</hi> power of electricity. He afterwards fired inflammable air, gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and inflammable oils, by the ſame means. He alſo inſtituted ſeveral other experiments, which helped to enlarge the power of the electrician; but the moſt important of his diſcoveries was, the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the electric power was not created by the globe or tube, but only collected by them. Dr. FRANKLIN, and Mr. WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON,

               <p>Beſides theſe valuable diſcoveries, the Hiſtorian of Electricity informs us, that Mr. WATSON firſt obſerved the different colour of the ſpark, as drawn from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent bodies; that electricity ſuffered no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction in paſſing through glaſs; that the power of electricity was not affected by the preſence or abſence of fire, ſince the ſparks were equally ſtrong from a freezing mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as from red hot iron; that flame and ſmoke were conductors of electricity; and that the ſtroke was, as the points of contact of the non-electrics on the outſide of the glaſs. This inveſtigation led to the coat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of phials, in order to increaſe the power of accumulation; and qualified him emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to be the principal actor in thoſe famous experiments, which were made on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and at <hi>Shooter's Hill,</hi> in the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0179600402:320"/>

Among others, the celebrated VOLTA has given him teſtimony of the excellence and greatneſs of his experiments, in a paper publiſhed within theſe few years. In that paper, he ſhews how ſimple electrical conductors might be ſo conſtructed, as not only to give ſhocks like the <hi>Leyden</hi> phial, but even ſuch as are ſufficiently powerful to kill large animals, and to equal the effects of lightning. He however expreſſes his deſpair of ever ſeeing ſuch put into execution; but adds—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Un</hi> WATSON <hi>forſe ſat ebbe tentato di farlo,</hi> &amp;c. A WATSON perhaps might be tempted to make the experiment: he who for another purpoſe (which was, that he might ſhew the extreme velocity, with which the electrical power communicated itſelf, from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of a conductor to the other, however great its length) extended inſulated iron wires to more than two miles in length; and to whom, on account of theſe very experiments, MUSCHENBROEK took occaſion to addreſs himſelf as follows: <hi>Magnificentiſſimis tuis experimentis ſuperaſti conatus omnium.</hi> See a paper in <hi>Opere Scelti</hi> di Milano date Como 20 Aug. 1778."</q>

Mr. WATSON conducted ſome other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, with ſo much ſagacity and addreſs, relating to the impracticability of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting odours, and the power of purgatives through glaſs; and thoſe relating to the exhibition of what was called the "Glory round the Head," or the "Beatification," boaſted to have been done by ſome philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers on the continent; that he procured, at length, an acknowledgment from Mr. BOSE, of what he called "an Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," in conducting the experiments; a procedure totally incompatible with the true ſpirit of a philoſopher!</p>

               <p>Theſe tracts were collected, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately publiſhed in octavo, and reached to a third or fourth edition. They were of ſo intereſting a nature, that they gave him the lead, as it were, in this branch of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; and were not only the means of raiſing him to a high degree of eſtimation at home, but of extending his fame throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi> His houſe became the reſort of the moſt ingenious and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious experimental philoſophers that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> could boaſt.</p>

               <p>AS Mr. WATSON had conſtantly lived in <hi>London,</hi> he had been a curious obſerver of the wonderful increaſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that vaſt city.

               <p>In the hard winter of 1756, he wrote "Some Obſervations on preventing the freezing of Water in the Leaden Pipes of the City of <hi>London;</hi>" occaſioned by the injudicious and ineffectual method, practiſed frequently, of ſtrewing dung in the ſtreets over the pipes. Theſe were printed in the <hi>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">The method was ſimply by means of two addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional braſs cocks. One to be inſerted into the leaden pipe, two feet before it comes into the air, guarded by a wooden caſe, filled up with horſe litter, and reaching near to the ſurface of the ground, and covered over, even with the ground, by a brick or ſtone. This is to ſerve as a ſtop-cock, and to be turned by the help of an iron key. The other cock is to be faſtened to the leaden pipe in the open air, in any part of its length, provided it be ſomewhat below the level of the ſtop-cock. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſimply to empty the leaden pipe of all its water, after it has been turned off by the ſtop-cock.

out a ſucceſsful method of effecting the purpoſe, which he had himſelf employed in the ſevere winter of 1739-40. Other inſtances, beſides this, occur, of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whatever might advance the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the public.

of Mr. WATSON's knowledge in the practice of phyſic, in natural hiſtory, and experimental philoſophy, were not ſurpriſed to ſee him riſe into the higher line of his profeſſion. This event took place in 1757, previous to which he had been choſen a member of the Royal Academy of <hi>Madrid;</hi> and he was created doctor of phyſic by the Univerſity of <hi>Halle,</hi> under a diploma, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date September the 6th.

               <p>This alteration in his circumſtances and proſpects, hazardous as it might be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by ſome, occaſioned no diminution in his emoluments, but far the contrary.

               <p>We find alſo two zoological articles laid before the Royal Society by Dr. WATSON. The firſt of theſe relates to the inſect called the <hi>Vegetable Fly,</hi> which had impoſed on the credulity of many, under the idea of its being an inſect flying about with a vegetable growing on its back: whereas in fact it was nothing more than a fungus of the <hi>Clavaria</hi> genus, growing from the dead nymph of a <hi>Cicada,</hi> as well as from any other putrid animal ſubſtances<note n="n" place="bottom">

This was a young man, aged twenty-eight, who died after being afflicted with an aſthma only two months. The lungs were found in an extraordinarily emphyſematous ſtate, and the pulmonary

vein varicoſe in a great degree. A ſoreneſs of the cheſt, ſucceeded by a cough and a ſhortneſs of breath, had in this young man's caſe immediately ſucceeded a violent and long-continued vomiting; to which cauſe Dr. WATSON was inclined to attribute the origin of this diſeaſe<note n="t" place="bottom">

               <p>Part of a Letter to Dr. HUXHAM, giving ſome account of the late cold weather, dated <hi>London,</hi> Feb. 14, 1767. By this it appears that the thermometer in <hi>London</hi> ſtood, when at the loweſt, on the 19th, at eight in the morning, at 15″½: and on the ſame day, at <hi>Norwich,</hi> it was obſerved as low as ſeven degrees<note n="u" place="bottom">Ib. Vol. lvii. p. 443.</note>.</p>
               <p>In 1768, Dr. WATSON publiſhed "An Account of a Series of Experiments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted with a view of aſcertaining the moſt ſucceſsful Method of inoculating the Small-pox." 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Theſe experiments were deſigned to prove whether there was any <hi>ſpecific</hi> virtue in preparatory medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: whether the diſeaſe was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable when the matter was taken from
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0179600402:338"/>
the natural, or the artificial pock: and, whether the crude lymph, or the highly-concocted matter, produced different effects. The reſult was, what ſucceeding and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple experience has confirmed, that after due abſtinence from animal food, and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liquors, it is of ſmall importance what kind of variolous matter is uſed; and that no preparatory ſpecifics are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>

               <p>This diſeaſe, on which Dr. WHYTT, Dr. WATSON, and others, have lately writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſo inſtructive a manner, deſerves to be accurately noticed, and the knowledge of it ſtrongly inculcated; as, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at leaſt, it is not unfrequently miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and treated as a putrid and comatoſe fever.</p>
               <p>As Dr. WATSON lived in intimacy with the moſt illuſtrious and learned Fellows of the Royal Society; ſo he was himſelf one of its moſt active members, and ever zealous in promoting the ends of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. For many years he was a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent member of the council; and, during the preſidentſhip of Sir <hi>John</hi> PRINGLE, was elected one of the vice-preſidents; which honourable office he continued to fill to the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0179600402:340"/>
end of his days. He was a moſt conſtant attendant on the public meetings of the Society; and on the private aſſociations of its members, eſpecially on that formerly held every Thurſday, at the Mitre, in <hi>Fleet Street,</hi> and now at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in the <hi>Strand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1784, Dr. WATSON was choſen a Fellow of the Royal College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; and made one of the Elects. In the ſucceeding year, he communicated to the College, "An Account of a diſeaſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by tranſplanting a Tooth." This was inſerted in the <hi>Medical Tranſactions;</hi> and this, I believe, was the laſt paper he wrote<note n="b" place="bottom">P. 325-338.</note>.</p>
               <p>In 1786, he had the honour of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood conferred upon him; being one of the body deputed by the College to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Majeſty on his eſcape from aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>In general, Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON enjoyed a firm ſtate of health. It was ſometimes interrupted by fits of the gout; but theſe ſeldom confined him long to the houſe. In
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0179600402:341"/>
the year 1786, the decline of his health was very viſible to his friends, and his ſtrength was greatly diminiſhed, together with much of that vivacity which ſo ſtrongly marked his character. He died May 10, 1787.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON had a natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity both of mind and body, that never allowed him to be indolent in the ſlighteſt degree. He was a moſt exact oeconomiſt of his time, and throughout life a very early riſer, being up uſually in ſummer at ſix o'clock, and frequently ſooner; thus ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf daily two or three uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted hours for ſtudy. In his younger days, theſe early hours, as I have before obſerved, were frequently given up to the purpoſes of ſimpling; but, in riper years, they were devoted to ſtudy. He read much and carefully; and his ardent and unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting deſire to be acquainted with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of all thoſe ſciences which were his objects, joined to a vigorous and retentive memory, enabled him to treaſure up a vaſt ſtock of knowledge. What he thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, he freely diſpenſed. His mode of conveying information was clear, forcible,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0179600402:342"/>
and energetic, and juſtified the encomium beſtowed upon him by a learned foreigner, in a letter to a correſpondent<note n="c" place="bottom">WATSONIUS <hi>Botanicus et Phyſicus clarus eſt et perſpicax homo, itidemque humaniſſimus.</hi> M. Meckel, of <hi>Berlin,</hi> in Epiſtolis ad HALLERUM <hi>datis.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>His attention, however, was by no means confined to the ſubjects of his own profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or thoſe of philoſophy at large. He was a careful obſerver of men, and of the manners of the age; and the extraordinary endowment of his memory had furniſhed him with a great variety of intereſting and entertaining anecdotes, concerning the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and circumſtances of his time<note n="d" place="bottom">It is to Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON that we owe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervation of an anecdote, which tends further to illuſtrate the character, and exalt the ſincerity and integrity of the excellent Mr. ADDISON. It is inſerted in the <hi>Addenda</hi> to his Life, in the third volume of the <hi>Biographia Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica.</hi> Dr. KIPPIS alſo acknowledges himſelf the moſt indebted to him for the materials of the life of the late <hi>Henry</hi> BAKER, Eſq.</note>.</p>
               <p>On all ſubjects, his liberal and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative diſpoſition, and his courteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, encouraged enquiry; and thoſe who ſought for information from him, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0179600402:343"/>
departed without it. In his epiſtolary correſpondence he was copious and preciſe; and ſuch as enjoyed the privilege and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, experienced in his punctuality another qualification which greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced its value.</p>
               <p>Some of the firſt of Sir <hi>William</hi> WAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON's papers in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> evince his early proficiency in the ſcience of Botany, and eſpecially his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpecies: nor was he leſs ſkilled in exotics in his riper years. That he was very ſoon conſidered on the continent as highly reſpectable in this light, is manifeſt from his having been one of the few in <hi>England,</hi> whom Mr. CLIFFORD gratified with a copy of the <hi>Hortus Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortianus;</hi> a work, at its firſt publication, only attainable by thoſe whoſe ſtudies and acquirements in the ſubject of it, entitled them to receive it from the munificence of Mr. CLIFFORD himſelf. In fact, all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed foreigners, of the ſame bias in their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, brought letters of recommendation to him; and, on their return, failed not, both in their correſpondence and in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0179600402:344"/>
to bear honourable teſtimony to his learning and abilities.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON had learned to know plants by the ſyſtem and nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of RAY, when <hi>trivial</hi> names were unknown; and he was ſo ſingularly happy in a tenacious memory, as to be able to repeat, with wonderful promptitude, the long names which had been in uſe from the times of BAUHINE, GERARD, and PARKINSON; a taſk from which botaniſts are relieved, by the introduction of the <hi>Linnaean trivial</hi> epithets. He lived to ſee the ſyſtem of his much-honoured country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man give way to that of the <hi>Swede,</hi> which began to take place in <hi>England</hi> about this period; and with which alſo he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acquainted. His knowledge of plants, and the hiſtory of them in the various au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, was ſo eminently extenſive, that his opinion was frequently appealed to as deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive on the ſubject; and by ſome of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friends he was uſually called <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The living Lexicon of Botany."</q> Had it been the lot of Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON to have been devoted to Botany as an official em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0179600402:345"/>
or had the more important avocations of his profeſſion allowed a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indulgence to his favourite bias, ſuch an union of natural endowments and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired knowledge as he poſſeſſed, muſt have placed him very high among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts of this age.</p>
               <p>It remains for me to do juſtice to the worth of Sir <hi>William</hi> WATSON as a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and as a member of ſociety. But as theſe parts of his character have been already delineated with great truth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination by my much-reſpected friend Dr. GARTHSHORE, I ſhall conclude this account by ſome extracts from the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial read by him to a ſociety of phyſicians, of which Sir <hi>William</hi> had been the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As a phyſician, his humanity, aſſiduity, and caution, were eminently conſpicuous; and his exact obſervance of the duties of ſocial politeneſs muſt ever be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pleaſure by all thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the happineſs of his acquaintance.

The ſame affability and good humour which adorned his character in public life, were preſerved alſo in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his family, and endeared him to thoſe who were more immediately around him. He was ſcarcely ever out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, was always benignant and kind to his friends and relations—and, it would be injurious to his memory not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an anecdote which equally diſplays his humanity, and the warmth with which he intereſted himſelf in the caſes of his patients—Not many years before his death, he was waked ſuddenly one morning very early by his ſervant, who came to inform him that his houſe had been broken open, and that his plate (which was of conſiderable value) was ſtolen—"Is that all?" ſaid he, coolly—I was afraid you had brought me ſome alarming meſſage from Mr. —, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

               <p>AS I am now arrived beyond the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, when the name of LINNAEUS began to be celebrated throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> it will be neceſſary to recur to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his viſit to this country, that the introduction and full eſtabliſhment of his ſyſtem in this kingdom, may be better illuſtrated. Here, had his reception been
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0179600402:349"/>
more encouraging to his wiſhes, it has been ſaid, he was diſpoſed to have taken up his reſidence. He had been ſome time in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> under the patronage, and in the houſe, of Mr. CLIFFORD. He had taken his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of doctor in phyſic. He had gained the eſteem of BOERHAAVE, and from him brought letters of recommendation to the literati of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fame of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE and his Muſeum, and the eſteem in which LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS held the character of DILLENIUS, added to the deſire of inſpecting the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardian Pinax,</hi> were among the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motives that induced the <hi>Swede</hi> to viſit <hi>England.</hi> This event took place in the ſpring of 1736. I am only able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſeaſon of the year, from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the pleaſure he expreſſed, in meeting in the fields with thoſe produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>England,</hi> that are not ſpontaneouſly growing in <hi>Sweden.</hi> His delight particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in ſeeing under the hedges the <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth</hi> in full flower, can only be conceived by thoſe who poſſeſs ſome ſhare of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical ardour which he poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0179600402:350"/>
At this time, the ſexual ſyſtem exiſted only in its outline. Enough of it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was manifeſted in the <hi>Florula Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponica,</hi> printed in the <hi>Acta Upſalienſia,</hi> for the years 1732 and 1733, and in the firſt ſketch of the <hi>Syſtema,</hi> in 1735, to exhibit its novelty. I know not that the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta Botanica,</hi> the <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> and the <hi>Muſa Cliffortiana,</hi> although they bear date in 1736, had reached <hi>England</hi> before the author: yet, notwithſtanding the warm recommendation of BOERHAAVE, Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, conſidered at that time as the <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of Botany in this iſland, gave the author, and his ſyſtem, an unfavourable reception. At the age of ſeventy-ſix, we need not be ſurpriſed that the veteran ſhould not feel diſpoſed to learn a new ſyſtem, from a young man, whom he could not but conſider as an adventurer, both in fortune, in fame, and in ſcience. SLOANE, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, had never paid ſufficient attention to the improvement of ſcience in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of generical characters; and this circumſtance, probably, ſet him at a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance from embracing the ſyſtem of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0179600402:351"/>
LINNAEUS, which exhibited an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo widely different from the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined aſſemblage of the Hiſtory of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt not however be underſtood, that Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE remained inſenſible to the genius and accompliſhments of LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS: on the contrary, when he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent him his <hi>Flora Lapponica,</hi> Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE wrote him a letter, bearing date Dec. 20, 1737, expreſſive of the great pleaſure he received in the peruſal of it; exhorting him to elucidate the remaining parts of the natural hiſtory of his country, on the ſame plan.</p>
               <p>DILLENIUS was highly ſenſible of his merit, and gave him the moſt polite recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But that he who had been ſo long verſed in the ſyſtems of TOURNEFORT and RAY, and after having given improvement to the latter, by which he had deſerved and received the applauſe, not of <hi>England</hi> alone, but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhould abandon that ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, to embrace the hitherto uncounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced novelties of LINNAEUS, could not reaſonably be expected.</p>

The journey into <hi>England</hi> however, was, on the whole, highly gratifying to LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS. He beheld with aſtoniſhment the collections of SLOANE, and, with rapture, the <hi>Herbaria</hi> of PETIVER, PLUKENET, BU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DELLE, and of many others there repoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe names were familiar to him. At <hi>Oxford</hi> he inſpected, with no leſs ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Pinax</hi> of SHERARD, which he had eagerly wiſhed to ſee publiſhed, and of which DILLENIUS had compleated about a fourth part. But an undertaking of that nature and extent, after the death of the firſt projector of it, demanded a patronage and an expence, not eaſily obtained.</p>
               <p>About the time LINNAEUS made his tour into this country, indigenous botany was on the whole in a languiſhing ſtate. It no longer felt that degree of ſupport, which the SHERARDS, and Sir HANS, had afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The Conſul was dead; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining years of Dr. <hi>James</hi> SHERARD, and of Sir <hi>Hans</hi> SLOANE, began to withdraw them from the buſtle, and almoſt from the buſineſs, of life. After the publication of RAY's <hi>Synopſis</hi> by DILLENIUS, in 1724,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0179600402:353"/>
no work of magnitude on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except the <hi>Hiſtoria Muſcorum,</hi> in 1741, took place for many years; not that there were wanting ſeveral individuals, who were eminent for their knowledge of indigenous botany, and zealous in propagating it: as inſtances, I refer to the names of WATSON, COLLINSON, MILLER, and BLACKSTONE. The arrival however of LINNAEUS in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the conſequent promulgation of his method, excited that curioſity which novelty will ever attract, and, although his ſyſtem might be but little reliſhed at the inſtant, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> naturaliſts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, there were yet a few into whoſe minds his doctrines ſilently inſinuated themſelves, and gained approbation.</p>
               <p>In the year 1737, the next after LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS left <hi>England,</hi> he publiſhed the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera Plantarum,</hi> which compleatly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded the ſexual ſyſtem, as far as related to claſſical and generical characters; and in the ſame year exemplified it in the ſpecies, by the <hi>Flora Lapponica,</hi> and the <hi>Hortus Cliffortianus.</hi> At the ſame time, anxious as it ſhould ſeem above all, to gain the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0179600402:354"/>
of DILLENIUS, he dedicated to him the <hi>Critica Botanica;</hi> in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his reaſons for the change of names, and for the eſtabliſhment of new diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both of which, he well knew, would be conſidered as dangerous innovations.</p>
               <p>Theſe volumes ſoon found their way into the libraries of the curious in <hi>England;</hi> though the <hi>Hortus Cliffortianus</hi> was, at firſt, only diſperſed through the munificence of Mr. CLIFFORD. The ſimplicity of the claſſical characters as the baſis, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the generical notes, confined wholly to the parts of fructification, and that preciſion which marked the ſpecific diſtinctions, advantages, of which all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſyſtems were deſtitute, ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the aſſent of the unprejudiced; and an interval of a few years, gave LINNAEUS's method a decided ſuperiority with <hi>Engliſh</hi> botaniſts.</p>
               <p>After the eſtabliſhment of LINNAEUS in the profeſſorſhip in the year 1741, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the <hi>Theſes,</hi> afterwards, in a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected form, called the <hi>Amoenitates Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micae,</hi> commenced, and, in leſs than ten
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0179600402:355"/>
years, two volumes had been publiſhed. Theſe tracts, by the variety of uſeful and entertaining knowledge, with which they abound, equally extended and augmented the reputation of LINNAEUS. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced his oppoſers, that his knowledge was not bounded by mere nomenclature, and ſyſtematic arrangement, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully objected.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>In <hi>England,</hi> Dr. MARTYN, in his <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> publiſhed in 1740; DILLENIUS, in his <hi>Hiſtoria Muſcorum,</hi> 1741; and BLACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE, in his <hi>Specimen Botanicum,</hi> 1746, had referred to the writings of LINNAEUS; and occaſionally his name had been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> and other periodical works: but, as yet, no tranſlation of any part of his writings, or any publication on his plan, had been made in this country, until, in 1754, a <hi>Swediſh</hi> pupil of the <hi>Upſal</hi> ſchool arranged, by the generic and trivial names only, all the plants of RAY's <hi>Synopſis,</hi> according to the ſyſtem of his maſter. This little tract was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0179600402:356"/>
tranſmitted to the Royal Society, and excited much attention among thoſe profeſſed ſtudents, and lovers of <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany, who obtained the peruſal of it.</p>
               <p>In 1756, Dr. BROWNE claſſed all his <hi>Jamaica</hi> plants, amounting to 1200 ſpecies, in the ſame method. The drawings having been made by EHRET, had the advantage of ſeparate delineations of the flower and fruit.</p>
               <p>In 1759, Mr. STILLINGFLEET pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Tranſlation of ſeveral Tracts from the <hi>Amoenitates;</hi> and, by his own valuable additions, his inſtructive Preface, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and learned notes interſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the book, by his own "Calendar of Flora," confirming and illuſtrating that of the <hi>Swede,</hi> greatly conduced to exalt the reputation of LINNAEUS in <hi>England.</hi> Of this learned and excellent man, the reader will find ſome memoirs in the <hi>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for 1776, which were afterwards incorporated into "Anecdotes of Mr. <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi>" (ſee p. 300), and into the <hi>Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Dramatica,</hi> 2d edition, 1782.</p>
               <p>The next year, Mr. LEE, by his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0179600402:357"/>
of the <hi>Elements</hi> of the Sexual Syſtem, much contributed to facilitate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and extend the progreſs and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of it, among the leſs learned of his countrymen, or ſuch as were unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the <hi>Fundamenta,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophia Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanica</hi> of the author.</p>
               <p>At this juncture, it is material among thoſe circumſtances which accelerated the progreſs of the new ſyſtem, to mention the arrival of the late much-lamented Dr. SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANDER, who came into <hi>England</hi> on the firſt of July, 1760. His name, and the connexion he was known to bear as the favourite pupil of his great maſter, had of themſelves ſome ſhare in exciting a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which led to information; whilſt his perfect acquaintance with the whole ſcheme enabled him to explain its minuteſt parts, and elucidate all thoſe obſcurities with which, on a ſuperficial view it was thought to be enveloped. I add to this, that the urbanity of his manners, and his readineſs to afford every aſſiſtance in his power, joined to that clearneſs and energy with which he effected it, not only brought
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0179600402:358"/>
conviction of its excellence in thoſe who were inclined to receive it, but conciliated the minds, and diſpelled the prejudices, of many who had been averſe to it.</p>
               <p>By all theſe preliminary advances, the learned were prepared to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> botany modelled according to the rules of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſchool. Dr. HILL ſeized the firſt opportunity of attempting it, in his <hi>Flora Britannica,</hi> 1760; but it was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a manner ſo unworthy of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that his work can have no claim to the merit of having anſwered the occaſion: and thus the credit of the atchievement fell to the lot of Mr. <hi>William</hi> HUDSON, F.R.S. who, to an extenſive knowledge of <hi>Engliſh</hi> plants, acquired by an attention to nature, had, by his reſidence in the <hi>Britiſh Muſeum,</hi> all the auxiliary reſources that could favour his deſign: acceſs particularly to the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baria</hi> of almoſt all the aſſiſtants of RAY and DILLENIUS, mentioned in the <hi>Synopſis,</hi> gave him the opportunity of comparing the individual ſpecimens of that work with his own; and thus enabled him to diſpel a multitude of doubts and uncertainties, in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0179600402:359"/>
which, otherwiſe, his application of the <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyma</hi> might have been involved.</p>
               <p>The ſexual ſyſtem was received nearly about the ſame time in the univerſities of <hi>Britain;</hi> being publicly taught by Mr. Profeſſor MARTYN, at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and by Dr. HOPE, at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The adoption of it by theſe learned Profeſſors, I conſider, therefore, as the aera of the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem in <hi>Britain</hi>—a ſyſtem, which, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, had given the author of it a literary domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the vegetable kingdom; which, in the rapidity of its extenſion, and the ſtrength of its influence, had not perhaps been paralleled in the annals of ſcience.</p>
