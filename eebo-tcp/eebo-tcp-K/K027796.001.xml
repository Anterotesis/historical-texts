            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the Nature of Epic Poetry</note> 
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Fables of Poets were originally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in repreſenting the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi>
according to the notion then conceiv'd of
it. This ſublime Subject occaſion'd the
firſt Poets to be call'd Divines, and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<hi>the Language of the Gods.</hi> They divided
the divine Attributes into ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
becauſe the infirmity of a human
Mind cannot ſufficiently conceive, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
ſo much Power and Action in a Simplicity ſo great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible
as that of God. And perhaps they were alſo jealous of
the advantages they reap'd from ſuch excellent and exalted learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of which they thought the vulgar part of mankind was
not worthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0745000101:12"/>
They could not deſcribe the Operations of this Almighty
Cauſe, without ſpeaking at the ſame time of its Effects: ſo that
to Divinity they added <hi>Phyſiology,</hi> and treated of both, without
quitting the umbrages of their Allegorical Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Man</hi> being the chief and the moſt noble of all that
God produc'd, and nothing being ſo proper, or more uſeful to
Poets than this Subject; they added it to the former, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the doctrine of <hi>Morality</hi> after the ſame manner as they
did that of Divinity and Philoſophy: And from Morality thus
treated, is form'd that kind of Poem and Fable which we call
<hi>Epic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poets did the ſame in Morality, that the Divines had done
in Divinity. But that infinite variety of the actions and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Divine Nature, (to which our underſtanding bears
ſo ſmall a proportion) did as it were force them upon dividing
the ſingle Idea of the Only One God into ſeveral Perſons, under
the different names of <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Neptune,</hi> and the reſt.</p>
               <p>And on the other hand, the nature of Moral Philoſophy being
ſuch, as never to treat of things in particular, but in general; the
Epic Poets were oblig'd to unite in one ſingle Idea, in one and
the ſame Perſon, and in an Action which appear'd ſingular, all
that look'd like it in different perſons, and in various actions;
which might be thus contain'd as ſo many <hi>Species</hi> under their
<hi>Genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Preſence of the Deity, and the Care ſuch an auguſt Cauſe
is to be ſuppos'd to take about any action, obliges the Poet
to repreſent this action as great, important, and manag'd by
<note n="*" place="margin">

in an elevated way above the vulgar, and in a ſtyle that may
in ſome fort keep up the character of the Divine Perſons he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces. <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cui mens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinior atque os Magna ſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum, des No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis hujus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norem.</hi> Horat.</note> To this end ſerve the poetical and figurative Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and the Majeſty of the Heroick Verſe.</p>
               <p>But all this, being divine and ſurpriſing, may quite ruin all
Probability: Therefore the Poet ſhould take a peculiar care as to
that point, ſince his chief aim is to inſtruct, and without Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
any action is leſs likely to perſuade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0745000101:13"/>
Laſtly, ſince Precepts ought to be <note n="‡" place="margin">

conceiv'd, and leſs oppreſs the memory; and ſince nothing
can be more effectual to this end than propoſing one ſingle Idea,
and collecting all things ſo well together, as to be preſent to
our minds all at once; therefore the Poets have reduc'd all to
one <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Denique ſit quodvis ſimplex duntaxat, &amp; unum.</hi> bid.</note> ſingle action, under one and the ſame deſign, and in a
body whoſe members and parts ſhould be homogeneous.</p>
               <p>What we have obſerv'd of the nature of the Epic Poem, gives
us a juſt Idea of it, and we may define it thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The Epic Poem is a diſcourſe invented by art, to form
the Manners, by ſuch inſtructions as are diſguis'd under the
allegories of ſome One important Action, which is related in
verſe, after a probable, diverting, and ſurprizing manner."</q>

            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Fable of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </note> IN every deſign which a man deliberately undertakes, the end
he propoſes is the firſt thing in his mind, and that by which
he governs the whole work, and all its parts: Thus ſince the End
of the Epic Poem is to regulate the Manners, 'tis with this firſt
view the Poet ought to begin.</p>
               <p>But there is a great difference between the Philoſophical and
the Poetical doctrine of Manners. The Schoolmen content
themſelves with treating of Virtues and Vices in general: the
inſtructions they give are proper for all States, People, and for
all Ages. But the Poet has a nearer regard to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and the neceſſities of his own nation. With this deſign he
makes choice of ſome piece of morality, the moſt proper and
juſt he can imagin: And in order to preſs this home, he makes
leſs uſe of the force of Reaſoning, than of the power of Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
accommodating himſelf to the particular cuſtoms and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of thoſe, who are to be the ſubject, or the readers, of his work.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee how <hi>Homer</hi> has acquitted himſelf in all theſe
reſpects.</p>
               <p>He ſaw the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for whom he deſign'd his Poem, were
divided into as many States as they had capital Cities. Each was
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0745000101:14"/>
a Body Politick apart, and had its form of government indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from all the reſt. And yet theſe diſtinct States were very
often oblig'd to unite together in one body againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemies. Theſe were two very different ſorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch as could not be comprehended in one maxim of
morality, and in one ſingle Poem.</p>
               <p>The Poet therefore has made two diſtinct Fables of them.
The one is for <hi>Greece</hi> in general, united into one body, but
compos'd of parts independent on each other; and the other
for each particular ſtate, conſider'd as they were in time of peace,
without the former circumſtances and the neceſſity of being
united.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt ſort of government, in the Union or rather
in the Confederacy of many independent States; experience has
always made it appear, <q rend="inline">"That nothing ſo much cauſes ſucceſs
as a due ſubordination, and a right underſtanding among the
chief commanders. And on the other hand, the inevitable
ruin of ſuch confederacies proceeds from the heats, jealouſies
and ambition of the differerent leaders, and the diſcontents of
ſubmitting to a ſingle General."</q> All ſorts of States, and in
particular the <hi>Grecians,</hi> had dearly experienc'd this truth. So that
the moſt uſeful and neceſſary inſtruction that could be given
them, was, to lay before their eyes the loſs which both the
People and the Princes muſt of neceſſity ſuffer, by the ambition,
diſcord, and obſtinacy of the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> then has taken for the foundation of his Fable this
great Truth; That a Miſunderſtanding between Princes is the
Ruin of their own States. <q rend="inline">"I ſing (ſays he) the Anger of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
ſo pernicious to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the cauſe of ſo many
Heroe's deaths, occaſion'd by the Diſcord and Separation of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>
and that Prince."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But that this truth may be compleatly and fully known, there is
need of a ſecond to ſupport it. 'Tis neceſſary in ſuch a deſign, not only
to repreſent the Confederate States at firſt diſagreeing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and from thence unfortunate; but to ſhow the ſame States
afterwards reconciled and united, and of conſequence victorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0745000101:15"/>
Let us now ſee how he has joyn'd all theſe in one general
action.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Several Princes independent on one another were united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a common enemy. The perſon whom they had elected
their General, offers an affront to the moſt valiant of all the
Confederates. This offended Prince is ſo far provoked, as to
relinquiſh the Union, and obſtinately refuſe to fight for the
common cauſe. This Miſ-underſtanding gives the enemy ſuch
an advantage, that the Allies are very near quitting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
with diſhonour. He himſelf who made the ſeparation is
not exempt from ſharing the misfortune which he brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his party. For having permitted his intimate friend to
ſuccour them in a great neceſſity, this friend is kill'd by the
enemy's General. Thus the contending Princes being both
made wiſer at their own coſt, are reconcil'd, and unite again:
Then this valiant Prince not only obtains the victory in the
publick cauſe, but revenges his private wrongs by killing with
his own hands the author of the death of his friend."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt Platform of the Poem, and the Fiction, which
reduces into one important and univerſal Action all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
upon which it turns.</p>
               <p>In the next place it muſt be render'd Probable by the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of times, places and perſons; Some perſons muſt be found
out, already known by Hiſtory or otherwiſe, whom we may
with Probability make the actors and perſonages of this Fable.
<hi>Homer</hi> has made choice of the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> and feign'd that this
action happen'd there. To a Phantome of his brain, whom he
would paint valiant and cholerick, he has given the name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>;
that of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to his General; that of <hi>Hector</hi> to the
Enemies Commander, and ſo to the reſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he was oblig'd to accommodate himſelf to the manners,
cuſtoms, and genius of the <hi>Greeks</hi> his Auditors, the better to make
them attend to the inſtruction of his Poem; and to gain their
approbation by praiſing them: So that they might the better
forgive him the repreſentation of their own faults in ſome of his
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0745000101:16"/>
chief Perſonages. He admirably diſcharges all theſe duties, by
making theſe brave Princes and thoſe victorious people all <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and the fathers of thoſe he had a mind to commend.</p>
               <p>But not being content, in a work of ſuch a length, to propoſe
only the principal point of the Moral, and to fill up the reſt with
uſeleſs ornaments and foreign incidents, he extends this Moral by
all its neceſſary conſequences. As for inſtance in the ſubject
before us, 'tis not enough to know, that a good underſtanding
ought always to be maintain'd among Confederates: 'Tis likewiſe
of equal importance, that if there happens any diviſion, care muſt
be taken to keep it ſecret from the enemy, that their ignorance
of this advantage may prevent their making uſe of it. And in
the ſecond place, when their concord is but counterfeit and
only in appearance, one ſhould never preſs the enemy too cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for this would diſcover the weakneſs which we ought to
conceal from them.</p>
               <p>The Epiſode of <hi>Patroclus</hi> moſt admirably furniſhes us with theſe
two inſtructions. For when he appear'd in the arms of <hi>Achilles,</hi>
the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who took him for that Prince now reconciled and
united to the Confederates, immediately gave ground, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the advantages they had before over the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi>
who ſhould have been contented with this ſucceſs, preſſes
upon <hi>Hector</hi> too boldly, and by obliging him to fight, ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
that it was not the true <hi>Achilles</hi> who was clad in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
but a Heroe of much inferior proweſs. So that <hi>Hector</hi>
kills him, and regains thoſe advantages which the <hi>Trojans</hi> had loſt,
on the opinion that <hi>Achilles</hi> was reconciled.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Fable of the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi>
                  </note> THE <hi>Odyſſey</hi> was not deſign'd, like the <hi>Iliad,</hi> for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of all the States of <hi>Greece</hi> join'd in one body, but for each
State in particular. As a State is compos'd of two parts; the
Head which commands, and the Members which obey; there are
inſtructions requiſite for both, to teach the one to govern, and
the others to ſubmit to Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0745000101:17"/>
There are two Virtues neceſſary to one in authority, Prudence
to order, and Care to ſee his orders put in execution. The Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Politician is not acquir'd but by a long experience in
all ſorts of buſineſs, and by an acquaintance with all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
forms of Governments and States. The Care of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
ſuffers not him that has the Government to rely upon
others, but requires his own preſence: And Kings who are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from their States, are in danger of loſing them, and give
occaſion to great diſorders and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe two points may be eaſily united in one and the ſame
man. <q rend="inline">* "A King forſakes his Kingdom to viſit the courts
of ſeveral Princes, where he learns the manners and cuſtoms
of different nations. From hence there naturally ariſes a vaſt
number of incidents, of dangers, and of adventures, very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a Political Inſtitution. On the other ſide, this Abſence
gives way to the diſorders which happen in his own kingdom,
and which end not till his return, whoſe preſence only can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh
all things."</q> Thus the Abſence of a King has the ſame
effects in this Fable, as the Diviſion of the Princes had in the
former.</p>
               <p>The Subjects have ſcarce any need but of one general max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,
which is, To ſuffer themſelves to be govern'd, and to obey
faithfully; whatever reaſon they may imagine againſt the orders
they receiv'd. It is eaſy to join this inſtruction with the other,
by beſtowing on this wiſe and induſtrious Prince ſuch Subjects,
as in his abſence would rather follow their own judgment than
his commands: and by demonſtrating the misfortunes which this
diſobedience draws upon them, the evil conſequences which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
infallibly attend theſe particular notions, which are entirely
different from the general Idaea of him who ought to govern.</p>
               <p>But as it was neceſſary that the Princes in the <hi>Iliad</hi> ſhou'd be
cholerick and quarrelſome, ſo it is neceſſary in the Fable of the
<hi>Odyſſey</hi> that the chief perſon ſhould be ſage and prudent. This
raiſes a difficulty in the Fiction; becauſe this perſon ought to be
abſent for the two reaſons aforemention'd, which are eſſential to
the Fable, and which conſtitute the principal aim of it: But
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0745000101:18"/>
he cannot abſent himſelf, without offending againſt another
maxim of equal importance; <hi>viz.</hi> That a King ſhould upon no
account leave his Country.</p>
               <p>It is true, there are ſometimes ſuch neceſſities as ſufficiently
excuſe the Prudence of a Politician in this point. But ſuch a
neceſſity is a thing important enough of it ſelf to ſupply matter
for another Poem, and this multiplication of the action would
be vicious. To prevent which in the firſt place, this Neceſſity
and the departure of the Hero muſt be disjoin'd from the Poem;
and in the ſecond place, the Hero having been oblig'd to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
himſelf, for a reaſon antecedent to the action and plac'd
diſtinct from the Fable, he ought not ſo far to embrace this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of inſtructing himſelf, as to abſent himſelf voluntarily from
his own Government. For at this rate, his Abſence would be
meerly Voluntary, and one might with reaſon lay to his charge
all the diſorders which might arrive.</p>
               <p>Thus in the conſtitution of the Fable, he ought not to take
for his action, and for the foundation of his Poem, the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Prince from his own country, nor his voluntary ſtay
in any other place; but his Return, and this return retarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his will. This is the firſt Idea <hi>Homer</hi> gives us of it.<note n="*" place="margin">Odyſſ. 5.</note>
His Hero appears at firſt in a deſolate Iſland, ſitting upon the
ſide of the Sea, which with tears in his eyes he looks upon as
the obſtacle that had ſo long oppos'd his Return, and detain'd
him from reviſiting his own dear Country.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, ſince this forc'd delay might more naturally and
uſually happen to ſuch as make voyages by ſea; <hi>Homer</hi> has ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
made choice of a Prince whoſe Kingdom was in an
Iſland.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee then how he has feign'd all this Action, making
his Hero a perſon in years, becauſe Years are requiſite to inſtruct
a man in Prudence and Policy.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A Prince had been oblig'd to forſake his native Country,
and to head an Army of his Subjects in a foreign expedition.
Having gloriouſly perform'd this enterpriſe, he was marching
home again, and conducting his Subjects to his own State.
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0745000101:19"/>
But ſpite of all the attempts, with which his eagerneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
had inſpir'd him, he was ſtopp'd by the way by tempeſts
for ſeveral years, and caſt upon ſeveral countries differing from
each other in Manners and Government. In theſe dangers
his Companions, not always following his orders, periſh'd
through their own fault. The Grandees of his country ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abuſe his abſence, and raiſe no ſmall diſorders at home.
They conſume his eſtate, conſpire to deſtroy his ſon, would
conſtrain his Queen to accept of one of them for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and indulge themſelves in all violence, ſo much the
more, becauſe they were perſuaded he would never return.
But at laſt he returns, and diſcovering himſelf only to his
ſon and ſome others, who had continu'd firm to him, he is an
eye-witneſs of the inſolence of his enemies, puniſhes them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their deſerts, and reſtores to his Iſland that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
and repoſe to which they had been ſtrangers during
his abſence."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the Truth, which ſerves for foundation to this fiction
is, that the Abſence of a perſon from his own home, or
his neglect of his own affairs, is the cauſe of great diſorders:
So the Principal point of the Action, and the moſt Eſſential
one, is the Abſence of the Heroe. This fills almoſt all the
Poem: For not only this real abſence laſted ſeveral years, but
even when the Heroe return'd, he does not diſcover himſelf;
and this prudent diſguiſe, from whence he reap'd ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
has the ſame effect upon the Authors of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and all others who knew him not, as his real abſence
had before, ſo that he is abſent as to them, 'till the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their puniſhment.</p>
               <p>After the Poet had thus compos'd his Fable, and join'd the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Truth, he then makes choice of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> the King of
the Iſle of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> to maintain the character of his chief Perſonage,
and beſtow'd the reſt upon <hi>Telemachus, Penelope, Antinous,</hi> and
others, whom he calls by what names he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here inſiſt upon the many excellent advices, which
are ſo many parts, and natural conſequences of the fundamental
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0745000101:20"/>
Truth; and which the Poet very dextrouſly lays down in thoſe
fictions, which are the Epiſodes and Members of the entire Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Such for inſtance are theſe advices: Not to intrude one's
ſelf into the Myſteries of Government, which the Prince keeps
ſecret: This is repreſented to us by the winds ſhut up in a bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hide,
which the miſerable Companions of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> would needs be
ſo fooliſh as to pry into. Not to ſuffer ones ſelf to be led away
by the ſeeming Charms of an idle and inactive life, to which the
<hi>Sirens Songs</hi> invited.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Improba Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren deſidia.</hi> Horat.</note> Not to ſuffer ones ſelf to be ſenſualiz'd by
pleaſures, like thoſe who were chang'd into brutes by <hi>Circe:</hi>
And a great many other points of Morality neceſſary for all
ſorts of people.</p>
               <p>This Poem is more uſeful to the People than the <hi>Iliad,</hi> where
the Subjects ſuffer rather by the ill conduct of their Princes, than
through their own miſcarriages. But in the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> 'tis not the
fault of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> that is the ruin of his Subjects. This wiſe
Prince leaves untry'd no method to make them partakers of the
benefit of his return. Thus the Poet in the <hi>Iliad</hi> ſays, <q rend="inline">"He
ſings the anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which had cauſed the death of ſo
many <hi>Grecians</hi>;"</q> and on the contrary, in the <note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> beſtows great Encomiums on <hi>Homer</hi> for the
Simplicity of his deſign, becauſe he has included in one ſingle
part all that happen'd at the ſiege of <hi>Troy.</hi> And to this he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the ignorance of ſome Poets who imagin'd that the Unity
of the Fable or Action was ſufficiently preſerved by the Unity
of the Heroe: and who compos'd their <hi>Theſeids, Heracleids,</hi> and
the like, wherein they only heap'd up in one Poem every thing
that happen'd to one Perſonage.</p>
               <p>He finds fault with thoſe Poets who were for reducing the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the <hi>Fable</hi> into the Unity of the <hi>Heroe,</hi> becauſe one man
may have performed ſeveral adventures, which 'tis impoſſible to
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0745000101:21"/>
reduce under any one and ſimple head. This reducing of all
things to Unity and Simplicity is what <hi>Horace</hi> likewiſe makes his
firſt Rule. <hi>Denique ſit quodvis ſimplex duntaxat, &amp; unum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to theſe Rules, it will be allowable to make uſe of
ſeveral Fables; or (to ſpeak more correctly) of ſeveral Incidents
which may be divided into ſeveral Fables; provided they are ſo
ordered, that the Unity of the Fable be not ſpoil'd. This liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is ſtill greater in the Epic Poem, becauſe 'tis of a larger extent,
and ought to be entire and compleat.</p>
               <p>I will explain my ſelf more diſtinctly by the Practice of <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No doubt but one might make four diſtinct Fables out of
theſe four following Inſtructions.<list>
                     <item>1. Diviſion between thoſe of the ſame Party expoſes them entirely
to their enemies.</item>
                     <item>2. Conceal your Weakneſs, and you will be dreaded as much, as if
you had none of thoſe imperfections, of which they are ignorant.</item>
                     <item>3. When your ſtrength is only feign'd, and founded only in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of others; never venture ſo far as if your ſtrength was real.</item>
                     <item>4. The more you agree together, the leſs hurt can your Enemies
do you.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis plain, I ſay, that each of theſe particular Maxims might
ſerve for the Ground-work of a Fiction, and one might make
four diſtinct Fables out of them. May one not then put all theſe
into one ſingle <hi>Epopea?</hi> Not unleſs one ſingle Fable can be made
out of all. The Poet indeed may have ſo much skill as to unite
all into one Body, as Members and Parts, each of which taken
aſunder would be imperfect; and if he joins them ſo, as that
this Conjunction ſhall be no hindrance at all to the Unity and
the regular Simplicity of the Fable. This is what <hi>Homer</hi> has done
with ſuch ſucceſs in the compoſition of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Diviſion between</hi> Achilles <hi>and his Allies tended to the ruin
of their Deſigns.</hi> 2. Patroclus <hi>comes to their relief in the Armour
of this Heroe, and</hi> Hector <hi>retreats.</hi> 3. <hi>But this young Man puſhing
the advantage, which his diſguize gave him, too far, ventures to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with</hi> Hector <hi>himſelf; but not being maſter of</hi> Achilles<hi>'s ſtrength
(whom he only repreſented in outward appearance) he is killed, and by</hi>
                  <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0745000101:22"/>
                  <hi>this means leaves the</hi> Grecian <hi>Affairs in the ſame diſorder, from
which in that diſguiſe he came to free them.</hi> 4. Achilles <hi>provok'd
at the death of his Friend, is reconciled, and revenges his loſs by the
death of</hi> Hector. Theſe various incidents being thus united, do
not make different Actions and Fables, but are only the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and unfiniſh'd parts of one and the ſame Action and Fable,
which alone can be ſaid to be compleat and entire: And all theſe
Maxims of the Moral, are eaſily reduc'd into theſe two parts,
which in my opinion cannot be ſeparated without enervating the
force of both. The two parts are theſe, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Concordiâ res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parvae creſcunt: diſcordiâ mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae dilabuntur.</hi> Saluſt. de bello Jug.</note> That a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is the preſervation, and Diſcord the deſtruction of States.</p>
               <p>Tho' then the Poet has made uſe of two parts in his Poems,
each of which might have ſerv'd for a Fable, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd:
Yet this Multiplication cannot be call'd a vicious and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
<hi>Polymythia,</hi> contrary to the neceſſary Unity and Simplicity
of the Fable; but it gives the Fable another qualification, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
neceſſary and regular, namely its Perfection and finiſhing
ſtroke.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Epic Poem.</note> THE Action of a Poem is the Subject which the Poet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes,
propoſes, and builds upon. So that the Moral and the
Inſtructions which are the End of the Epic Poem are not the
Matter of it. Thoſe the Poets leave in their Allegorical and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative
obſcurity. They only give notice at the <hi>Exordium,</hi> that

Ulyſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since then the Action is the Matter of a Fable, it is evident
that whatever incidents are eſſential to the Fable, or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a part of it, are neceſſary alſo to the Action, and are parts
of the Epic Matter, none of which ought to be omitted. Such
for inſtance, are the contention of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> the
ſlaughter <hi>Hector</hi> makes in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, the Re union of
the <hi>Greek</hi> Princes; and laſtly, the Re-ſettlement and Victory

               <p>The Unity of the Epic Action, as well as the Unity of the
Fable, does not conſiſt either in the Unity of the Heroe, or in
the Unity of Time: Three things I ſuppoſe are neceſſary to it.
The firſt is, to make uſe of no Epiſode but what ariſes from the
very platform and foundation of the Action, and is as it were a
natural member of the body. The ſecond is, exactly to Unite
theſe Epiſodes and theſe Members with one another. And the
third is, never to finiſh any Epiſode ſo as it may ſeem to be an
entire Action; but to let each Epiſode ſtill appear in its own
particular nature, as the member of a body, and as a part of it
ſelf not compleat.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> not only ſays that the Epic Action ſhould be One,
but adds, that it ſhould be entire, perfect, and compleat, and for
this purpoſe ought to have a <hi>Beginning,</hi> a <hi>Middle,</hi> and an <hi>End.</hi> Theſe
three parts of a whole are too generally and univerſally denoted
by the words, Beginning, Middle, and End; we may interpret
them more preciſely, and ſay, That the Cauſes and Deſigns of
an Action are the Beginning: That the Effects of theſe Cauſes,
and the Difficulties that are met with in the execution of theſe
deſigns, are the Middle; and that the Unravelling and Reſolution
of theſe difficulties are the End.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Action of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Homer</hi>'s deſign in the <hi>Iliad</hi> is to relate the Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of <hi>Achilles.</hi> The Beginning of this Action is the Change
of <hi>Achilles</hi> from a calm to a paſſionate temper. The Middle
is the Effects of his Paſſion, and all the illuſtrious Deaths it is
the Cauſe of. The End of this ſame Action is the Return of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>
to his Calmneſs of temper again. All was quiet in the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Camp, when <hi>Agamemnon</hi> their General provokes <hi>Apollo</hi>
againſt them, whom he was willing to appeaſe afterwards at the
coſt and prejudice of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who had no part in his fault.
This then is an exact Beginning: It ſuppoſes nothing before,
and requires after it the Effects of this Anger. <hi>Achilles</hi> revenges
himſelf, and that is an exact Middle; it ſuppoſes before it the
Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> this Revenge is the Effect of it. Then this
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0745000101:24"/>
Middle requires after it the Effects of this Revenge, which is
the Satisfaction of <hi>Achilles:</hi> for the Revenge had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
unleſs <hi>Achilles</hi> had been ſatisfied. By this means the Poet
makes his Heroe, after he was glutted by the Miſchief he had
done to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> by the death of <hi>Hector,</hi> and the Honour he
did his Friend, by inſulting o'er his Murderer; he makes him, I
ſay, to be moved by the Tears and Misfortunes of King <hi>Priam.</hi>
We ſee him as calm at the End of the Poem, during the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>Hector,</hi> as he was at the Beginning of the Poem, whilſt
the Plague raged among the <hi>Grecians.</hi> This End is juſt, ſince the
Calmneſs of temper <hi>Achilles</hi> re enjoy'd, is only an Effect of the
Revenge which ought to have preceded: And after this no Body
expects any more of his Anger. Thus has <hi>Homer</hi> been very exact
in the Beginning, Middle and End of the Action he made
choice of for the Subject of his <hi>Iliad.</hi>

oppoſed the Return of this Heroe, and againſt <hi>Calypſo</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

doubtleſs, the Reader would know why <hi>Neptune</hi> is diſpleas'd with
<hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> and how this Prince came to be with <hi>Calypſo</hi>? He would know
how he came from <hi>Troy</hi> thither? The Poet anſwers his Demands
out of the Mouth of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> himſelf, who relates theſe things,
and begins the Action, by the Recital of his Travels from the
City of <hi>Troy.</hi> It ſignifies little whether the Beginning of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be the Beginning of the Poem. The Beginning of this
Action is that which happens to <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> when upon his leaving
<hi>Troy</hi> he bends his Courſe for <hi>Ithaca.</hi> The Middle comprehends
all the Misfortunes he endured, and all the Diſorders of his own
Government. The End is the re-inſtating of this Hero in the
peaceable poſſeſſion of his Kingdom, where he was acknowledg'd
by his Son, his Wife, his Father, and ſeveral others. The Poet
was ſenſible he ſhould have ended ill had he gone no farther than
the death of theſe Princes, who were the Rivals and Enemies of
<hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> becauſe the Reader might have look'd for ſome Revenge
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0745000101:25"/>
which the Subjects of theſe Princes might have taken, on him
who had kill'd their Sovereigns: But this Danger over, and the
People vanquiſhed and quieted, there was nothing more to be
expected. The Poem and the Action have all their Parts, and
no more.</p>
               <p>But the Order of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> differs from that of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> in
that the <hi>Poem</hi> does not begin with the Beginning of the <hi>Action.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Of the Cauſes and Beginning of the Action.</note> The <hi>Cauſes of the Action</hi> are alſo what the Poet is oblig'd to
give an Account of. There are three ſorts of Cauſes, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
the Intereſts, and the Deſigns of Men; and theſe different
Cauſes of an Action are likewiſe often the Cauſes of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
every Man taking up thoſe Intereſts in which his Humour
ingages him, and forming thoſe Deſigns to which his Humour

               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> has ingeniouſly begun his <hi>Odyſſey</hi> with the Tranſactions
at <hi>Ithaca,</hi> during the abſence of <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> If he had begun with
the Travels of his Heroe, he would ſcarce have ſpoken of any one
elſe, and a Man might have read a great deal of the Poem, without
conceiving the leaſt Idea of <hi>Telemachus, Penelope,</hi> or her Suitors,
who had ſo great a ſhare in the Action; but in the beginning
he has pitch'd upon, beſides theſe Perſonages, whom he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
he repreſents <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in his full Length, and from the very
firſt opening one ſees the Intereſt which the Gods take in the
Action.</p>
               <p>The Skill and Care of the ſame Poet may be ſeen likewiſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
his Perſonages in the firſt Book of his <hi>Iliad,</hi> where he
diſcovers the Humours, the Intereſts, and the Deſigns of <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
                  <hi>Achilles, Hector, Ulyſſes,</hi> and ſeveral others, and even of the
Deities. And in his Second he makes a Review of the <hi>Grecian</hi>
and <hi>Trojan</hi> Armies; which is full Evidence, that all we have here
ſaid is very neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Middle or Intrigue of the Action.</note> As theſe <hi>Cauſes</hi> are the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Action, the oppoſite
Deſigns againſt that of the Hero are the <hi>Middle</hi> of it, and form
that Difficulty or <hi>Intrigue,</hi> which makes up the greateſt part of
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0745000101:26"/>
the Poem; the Solution or <hi>Unravelling</hi> commences when the
Reader begins to ſee that difficulty remov'd, and the doubts
clear'd up. <hi>Homer</hi> has divided each of his Poems into two Parts,
and has put a particular Intrigue, and the Solution of it, into
each Part.</p>
               <p>The firſt Part of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who is for
revenging himſelf upon <hi>Agamemnon</hi> by the means of <hi>Hector</hi> and
the <hi>Trojans.</hi> The <hi>Intrigue</hi> comprehends the three days Fight,
which happen'd in the Abſence of <hi>Achilles</hi>: and it conſiſts on
one ſide in the reſiſtance of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and the <hi>Grecians</hi>; and on
the other in the revengeful and inexorable Humour of <hi>Achilles,</hi>
which would not ſuffer him to be reconcil'd. The Loſs of the
<hi>Grecians</hi> and the Deſpair of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> prepare for a ſolution by
the ſatisfaction which the incens'd Heroe receiv'd from it. The
death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> join'd to the Offers of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> which of it
ſelf had prov'd ineffectual, remove this Difficulty, and make the
untravelling of the firſt part.</p>
               <p>This death is likewiſe the Beginning of the ſecond Part; ſince
it puts <hi>Achilles</hi> upon the deſign of revenging himſelf on <hi>Hector.</hi>
But the deſign of <hi>Hector</hi> is oppoſite to that of <hi>Achilles</hi>; This
<hi>Trojan</hi> is valiant, and reſolv'd to ſtand on his own defence. This
Valour and Reſolution of <hi>Hector,</hi> are on his part the cauſe of the
Intrigue. All the Endeavours <hi>Achilles</hi> us'd, to meet with <hi>Hector</hi>
and be the death of him; and the contrary Endeavours of the
<hi>Trojan</hi> to keep out of his Reach, and defend himſelf; are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue;
which comprehends the battle of the laſt day. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelling
begins at the death of <hi>Hector</hi>; and beſides that, it
contains the inſulting of <hi>Achilles</hi> over his Body, the Honours
he paid to <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and the Intreaties of King <hi>Priam.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets
of this King and the other <hi>Trojans,</hi> in the ſorrowful Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
they paid to <hi>Hector</hi>'s body, end the unravelling; they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the ſatisfaction of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and demonſtrate his Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is the return of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> into <hi>Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.
Neptune</hi> oppoſes it by raiſing tempeſts, and this makes the
Intrigue. The unravelling is the arrival of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> upon his own
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0745000101:27"/>
Iſland, where <hi>Neptune</hi> could offer him no farther injury. The
ſecond Part is the re-inſtating this Heroe in his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Princes that are his Rivals, oppoſe him, and this is
a freſh Intrigue: The Solution of it begins at their deaths,
and is compleated as ſoon as the <hi>Ithacans</hi> were appeas'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Parts in the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> have not one common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue.
The Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> forms both the Intrigues in the
<hi>Iliad</hi>; and it is ſo far the Matter of this <hi>Epopéa,</hi> that the very
Beginning and End of this Poem depend on the Beginning and
End of this Anger. But let the Deſire <hi>Achilles</hi> had to revenge
himſelf, and the Deſire <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> had to return to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
be never ſo near ally'd, yet we cannot place them under
one and the ſame Notion: For that Deſire of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> is not a
Paſſion that Begins and Ends in the Poem with the Action; 'tis
a natural Habit; nor does the Poet propoſe it for his Subject as
he does the Anger of <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already obſerv'd what is meant by the <hi>Intrigue,</hi> and
the <hi>Unravelling</hi> thereof; let us now ſay ſomething of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of forming both. Theſe two ſhould ariſe naturally out of the
very Eſſence and Subject of the Poem, and are to be deduced
from thence. Their Conduct is ſo exact and natural, that it ſeems
as if their Action had preſented them with whatever they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
without putting themſelves to the Trouble of a farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
               <p>What is more uſual and natural to Warriors, than Anger,
Heat, Paſſion, and Impatience of bearing the leaſt Affront or
Diſreſpect? This is what forms the Intrigue of the <hi>Iliad</hi>; and
every thing we read there is nothing elſe but the Effect of this
Humour and theſe Paſſions.</p>
               <p>What more natural and uſual Obſtacle to thoſe who take
Voyages, than the Sea, the Winds, and the Storms? <hi>Homer</hi>
makes this the Intrigue of the firſt Part of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi>: And
for the ſecond, he makes uſe of almoſt the infallible effect of the
long Abſence of a Maſter, whoſe return is quite deſpair'd of, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Inſolence of his Servants and Neighbours, the Danger of his
Son and Wife, and the Sequeſtration of his Eſtate. Beſides an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of almoſt twenty Years, and the inſupportable Fatigues
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0745000101:28"/>
joyn'd to the Age of which <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> then was, might induce him
to believe that he ſhould not be own'd by thoſe who thought him
dead, and whoſe Intereſt it was to have him really ſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he had preſently declar'd who he was, and had call'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> they would eaſily have deſtroy'd him as an Impoſtor,
before he had an Opportunity to make himſelf known.</p>
               <p>There could be nothing more natural nor more neceſſary
than this ingenious Diſguiſe, to which the advantages his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had taken of his Abſence had reduc'd him, and to which
his long Misfortunes had enur'd him. This allow'd him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
without hazarding any thing, of taking the beſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
he could, againſt thoſe perſons who could not ſo much as
miſtruſt any harm from him. This way was afforded him by
the very Nature of his Action, to execute his Deſigns, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Obſtacles it caſt before him. And 'tis this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
between the Prudence and the Diſſimulation of a ſingle Man
on one hand, and the ungovernable Inſolence of ſo many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
on the other, which conſtitutes the Intrigue of the ſecond
Part of the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the End or Unravelling of the Action.</note> If the <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Intrigue</hi> muſt be natural, and ſuch as ſprings from
the very Subject, as has been already urg'd: Then the <hi>Winding up</hi>
of the Plot, by a more ſure claim, muſt have this Qualification,
and be a probable conſequence of all that went before. As this
is what the Readers regard more than the reſt, ſo ſhould the Poet
be more exact in it. This is the End of the Poem, and the laſt
Impreſſion that is to be ſtamp'd upon them.</p>
               <p>We ſhall find this in the <hi>Odyſſey. Ulyſſes</hi> by a Tempeſt is caſt
upon the Iſland of the <hi>Phaeacians,</hi> to whom he diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and deſires they would favor his Return to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which was not very far diſtant. One cannot ſee any reaſon
why the King of this Iſland ſhould refuſe ſuch a reaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
to a Heroe whom he ſeem'd to have in great eſteem. The
<hi>Phaeacians</hi> indeed had heard him tell the Story of his Adventures;
and in this fabulous recital conſiſted all the advantage they could
derive from his Preſence; for the Art of War which they
admir'd in him, his Undauntedneſs under Dangers, his indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Patience, and other Virtues, were ſuch as theſe Iſlanders
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0745000101:29"/>
were not uſed to. All their Talent lay in ſinging and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and whatſoever was charming in a quiet life. And here
we ſee how dextrouſly <hi>Homer</hi> prepares the Incidents he makes uſe
of. Theſe People could do no leſs, for the Account with which
<hi>Ulyſſes</hi> had ſo much entertain'd them, than afford him a Ship
and a ſafe Convoy, which was of little expence or trouble to them.</p>
               <p>When he arriv'd, his long Abſence, and the Travels which had
disfigur'd him, made him altogether unknown; and the Danger
he would have incurr'd had he diſcover'd himſelf too ſoon,
forced him to a Diſguiſe: Laſtly, this Diſguiſe gave him an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſurprizing thoſe young Suitors, who for ſeveral years
together had been accuſtomed to nothing but to ſleep well, and
fare daintily.</p>
               <p>It was from theſe Examples that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> drew this Rule,
<q rend="inline">"that Whatever concludes the Poem ſhould ſo ſpring from the

               <p>The <hi>Iliad</hi> containing an Action of <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> the

               </p>
               <p>Beſides this <hi>Admiration,</hi> which in general diſtinguiſhes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic

between theſe Poems of the ſame Species. Theſe ſingular
Paſſions correſpond to the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Hero. Anger</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
reign throughout the <hi>Iliad,</hi> becauſe <hi>Achilles</hi> is angry, and the

Paſſions,</hi> becauſe that is the Character of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The Prudence,
Wiſdom, and Conſtancy of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> do not allow him either of
theſe Extremes, therefore the Poet does not permit one of them
to be predominant in the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi> He confines himſelf to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi>
only, which he carries to an higher pitch than in the

good, when one may diſcover the Virtue or Vice, the
good or ill Inclinations, of every one who ſpeaks or acts: They
are poetically bad, when Perſons are made to ſpeak or act out of
Character, or inconſiſtently, or unequally. The Manners of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
and of <hi>Mezentius</hi> are equally good, conſider'd poetically,
becauſe they equally demonſtrate the Piety of the one, and the
Impiety of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Character of the Heroe.</note> 'Tis requiſite to make the ſame diſtinction between a Heroe
in Morality and a Heroe in Poetry, as between moral and poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Goodneſs. <hi>Achilles</hi> had as much right to the latter as
<hi>Aeneas. Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that the Heroe of a Poem ſhould be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good nor bad; neither advanc'd above the reſt of mankind
by his Virtues, or ſunk beneath 'em by his Vices; that he may
be the properer and fuller Example to others, both what to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and what to decline.</p>
               <p>The other Qualifications of the <hi>Manners,</hi> are, that they be
<hi>ſuitable</hi> to the Cauſes which either raiſe or diſcover them in the
Perſons; that they have an exact <hi>Reſemblance</hi> to what Hiſtory or
Fable have delivered of thoſe perſons to whom they are aſcrib'd;
and that there be an <hi>Equality</hi> in them, ſo that no man is made
to act or ſpeak out of his character.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Unity of the Character.</note> But this Equality is not ſufficient for the <hi>Unity of the Character</hi>:
'tis further neceſſary that the ſame Spirit appear in all ſort of
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0745000101:31"/>
Encounters. Thus <hi>Aeneas</hi> acting with great <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Mildneſs</hi>
in the firſt part of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> which requires no other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
and afterwards appearing illuſtrious in Heroic valour
in the wars of the ſecond part, but there without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
either of a hard or a ſoft diſpoſition, would doubtleſs
be far from offending againſt the <hi>Equality</hi> of the Manners:
But yet there would be no <hi>Simplicity</hi> or <hi>Unity</hi> in the Character.
So that beſides the Qualities that claim their particular place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
different occaſions, there muſt be One appearing throughout,
which commands over all the reſt: And without this we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
'tis no Character.</p>
               <p>One may indeed make a Heroe as valiant as <hi>Achilles,</hi> as
pious as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and as prudent as <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> But 'tis a meer
Chimaera to imagine a Heroe that has the Valour of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
the Piety of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the Prudence of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> at one and
the ſame time. This Viſion might happen to an Author, who
would ſuit the character of a Heroe to whatever each part of
the Action might naturally require, without regarding the Eſſence
of the Fable, or the Unity of the Character in the ſame perſon
upon all ſorts of occaſions: This Heroe would be the mildeſt,
beſt-natur'd Prince in the world, and alſo the moſt cholerick, hard-hearted,
and implacable creature imaginable; he would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
tender like <hi>Aeneas,</hi> extreamly violent like <hi>Achilles,</hi> and
yet have the indifference of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> that is incapable of the
two extremes. Would it not be in vain for the Poet to call this
Perſon by the ſame name throughout?</p>
               <p>Let us reflect on the effects it would produce in ſeveral Poems,
whoſe Authors were of opinion, that the chief character of a
Heroe is that of an accompliſh'd Man. They would be all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
all valiant in Battle, prudent in Council, pious in the acts
of Religion, courteous, civil, magnificent; and laſtly endued
with all the prodigious Virtues any Poet could invent. All this
would be independent from the Action and the Subject of the
Poem; and upon ſeeing each Heroe ſeparated from the reſt of the
work, we ſhould not eaſily gueſs, to what Action and to what
Poem the Heroe belong'd? So that we ſhould ſee that none of thoſe
would have a Character, ſince the Character is that which makes
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0745000101:32"/>
a perſon diſcernable, and which diſtinguiſhes him from all others.</p>
               <p>This commanding Quality in <hi>Achilles</hi> is his Anger, in <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>
the art of Diſſimulation, in <hi>Aeneas</hi> Meekneſs. Each of theſe may
be ſtil'd, by way of eminence, the Character in theſe Heroes.</p>
               <p>But theſe Characters cannot be alone. 'Tis abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that ſome other ſhould give them a luſtre, and embelliſh
them as far as they are capable: Either by hiding the defects that
are in each, by ſome noble and ſhining Qualities; as the Poet has
done the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> by ſhading it with an extraordinary
Valour: Or by making them entirely of the nature of a true
and ſolid Virtue, as is to be obſerv'd in the two others. The Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> is a part of his Prudence; and the Meekneſs
of <hi>Aeneas</hi> is wholly employ'd in ſubmitting his Will to the Gods.
For the making up this Union, our Poets have joyn'd together
ſuch Qualities as are by nature the moſt compatible; <hi>Valour</hi> with
<hi>Anger, Meekneſs</hi> with <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> with <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi> This
laſt Union was neceſſary for the Goodneſs of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>; for without
that, his Diſſimulation might have degenerated into Wickedneſs
and Double-dealing.</p>

<hi>Care and Interpoſition of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Machines are of three ſorts. Some are <hi>Theological,</hi> and
were invented to explain the nature of God. Others are <hi>Phyſical,</hi>
and repreſent things of Nature. The laſt are <hi>Moral,</hi> and are the
Images of Virtues and Vices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> and the Ancients have given to their Deities the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Paſſions and Vices of Men. Their Poems are wholly Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical;
and in this view it is eaſier to defend <hi>Homer</hi> than to blame
him. We cannot accuſe him for making mention of many Gods,
for his beſtowing Paſſions upon them, or even introducing them
fighting againſt men. The Scripture uſes the like figures and
expreſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0745000101:33"/>
If it be allowable to ſpeak thus of the Gods in <hi>Theology,</hi> much
more in the Fictions of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> where if a Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
the Deities, he muſt give them ſuch Manners, Speeches,
and Actions as are conformable to the nature of the things they
repreſent under thoſe Divinities. The caſe is the ſame in <hi>Moral</hi>
Deities: <hi>Minerva</hi> is wiſe, becauſe ſhe repreſents Prudence; <hi>Venus</hi>
is both good or bad, becauſe the Paſſion of Love is capable of
theſe contrary qualities.</p>
               <p>Since among the Gods of a Poem ſome are good, ſome bad,
and ſome indifferently either; and ſince of our Paſſions we make
ſo many allegorical Deities; one may attribute to the <hi>Gods</hi> all that
is done in the Poem, whether good or evil. But theſe Deities do
not act conſtantly in one and the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they act inviſibly, and by meer Inſpiration; which
has nothing in it extraordinary or miraculous: being no more
than what we ſay every day, <q rend="inline">"That ſome God has aſſiſted us,
or ſome Daemon has inſtigated us."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At other times they appear viſibly, and manifeſt themſelves to
men, in a manner altogether miraculous and praeternatural.</p>
               <p>The third way has ſomething of both the others: It is in truth
a miracle, but is not commonly ſo accounted: This includes
Dreams, Oracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe ways muſt be <hi>Probable</hi>; for ſo neceſſary as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
is to the Epic Action, as nothing is ſo conducive to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
yet we can on the other hand admire nothing that we
think impoſſible. Tho' the Probability of theſe Machines be of
a very large extent, (ſince 'tis founded upon Divine Power) it
is not without limitations. There are numerous Inſtances of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
and probable Machines in the Epic Poems, where the
Gods are no leſs Actors than the Men. But the leſs credible ſort,
ſuch as <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> &amp;c. are far more rare.</p>
               <p>This ſuggeſts a Reflection on the Method of rendring thoſe
Machines probable, which in their own nature are hardly ſo.
Thoſe which require only <hi>Divine Probability,</hi> ſhould be ſo diſengag'd
from the Action, that one might ſubſtract them from it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſtroying the Action. But thoſe which are eſſential and
neceſſary, ſhould be grounded upon <hi>Human Probability,</hi> and not
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0745000101:34"/>
on the ſole Power of God. Thus the Epiſodes of <hi>Circe,</hi> the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
                  <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> &amp;c. are neceſſary to the Action of the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi>
and yet not humanly probable: Yet <hi>Homer</hi> has artificially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them to human Probability, by the Simplicity and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the <hi>Phaeacians,</hi> before whom he cauſes thoſe recitals to
be made.</p>
               <p>The next Queſtion is, Where, and on what occaſions Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines
may be uſed? It is certain <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> make uſe of
them every where, and ſcarce ſuffer any Action to be perform'd
without them. <hi>Petronius</hi> makes this a Precept: <hi>Per ambages, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orumque
miniſteria</hi> &amp;c. The Gods are mention'd in the very <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>
of their Works, the <hi>Invocation</hi> is addreſt to them, and
the whole <hi>Narration</hi> is full of them. The Gods are the <hi>Cauſes</hi>
of the Action, they form the <hi>Intrigue,</hi> and bring about the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
The precept of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> that the unravelling
of the Plot ſhould not proceed from a Miracle or the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a God, has place only in Dramatic Poetry, not in the
Epic. For it is plain that both in the Solution of the <hi>Iliad</hi> and
<hi>Odyſſey</hi> the Gods are concern'd: In the former, the Deities meet
to appeaſe the Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi>: <hi>Iris</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are ſent to
that purpoſe, and <hi>Minerva</hi> eminently aſſiſts <hi>Achilles</hi> in the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
combate with <hi>Hector.</hi> In the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> the ſame Goddeſs fights
cloſe by <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> againſt the Suitors, and concludes that Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the <hi>Ithacenſians,</hi> which compleats the Poem.</p>
               <p>We may therefore determine, that a Machine is not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
to extricate the Poet out of any difficulty which embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
him: But that the Preſence of a Divinity, and ſome Action ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
and extraordinary, are inſerted into almoſt all the parts of his
work, in order to render it more Majeſtic and more Admirable.
But this mixture ought to be ſo made, that the Machines might be
retrench'd without taking any thing from the Action. At the
ſame time it gives the Readers a leſſon of Piety and Virtue; and
teaches them, that the moſt brave and the moſt wiſe can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and attain nothing great and glorious, without the aſſiſtance
of Heaven. Thus the Machinery crowns the whole work, and
renders it at once, <hi>Marvellous, Probable,</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſhall proceed in the ſame method thro' the
courſe of theſe Annotations upon the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſſey,</hi>
as in thoſe upon the <hi>Iliad</hi>; conſidering
<hi>Homer</hi> chiefly as a Poet, endeavouring to
make his beauties <hi>underſtood,</hi> and not to
praiſe without a reaſon given. It is equally
an extreme, on the one hand to think <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
has no human defects; and on the other
to dwell ſo much upon thoſe defects, as to depreciate his beauties.
The greater part of Criticks form a general character, from the
obſervation of particular errors, taken in their own oblique or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
views; which is as unjuſt, as to make a judgment of the
beauty of a man's body from the ſhadow it happens to caſt, in
ſuch or ſuch a poſition. To convince the Reader of this intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
impartiality, we readily allow the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> to be inferior to the
<hi>Iliad</hi> in many reſpects. It has not that ſublimity of ſpirit, or
that enthuſiaſm of poetry; but then it muſt be allow'd, if it be
leſs noble, it is more inſtructive: The other abounds with
more Heroiſm, this with more Morality. The <hi>Iliad</hi> gives us a
draught of Gods and Heroes, of diſcord, of contentions, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0745000101:68"/>
ſcenes of ſlaughter; the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> ſets before us a ſcene more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the landſchapes of nature, the pleaſures of private life, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of every ſtation, the hoſpitality of ancient times; a leſs buſy,
but more agreeable portrait. The <hi>Iliad</hi> concludes with the ruin,
the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> with the happineſs of a nation. <hi>Horace</hi> was of the
ſame opinion, as is evident from the epiſtle to <hi>Lollius.</hi>

May I be forgiven the arrogance, if I ſhould offer a criticiſm
upon this tranſlation? The <hi>ſufferings</hi> of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> are the ſubject of
the whole <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> and yet <hi>Horace</hi> has omitted the mention of

I muſt alſo refute a criticiſm of <hi>Rapin,</hi> who will have it that the

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> includes a character of craft and low cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
unworthy of a brave ſpirit: But <hi>Euſtathius</hi> admirably vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
the Poet in this reſpect, he ſhews us that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

a man who could accommodate himſelf to every condition of
life; one who in the worſt eſtate had ſtill a reſerve to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from it; it therefore, ſays he, ſignifies a man that thro' expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
has learn'd wiſdom. I have likewiſe the authority of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
for this ſenſe, in the above-cited paſſage,
<q>
                        <hi>Qui domitor Trojae multorum</hi> providus <hi>urbes.</hi>
                     </q>
I take <hi>providus</hi> in this place to ſignify not only a man who noted
the manners of various nations with care, but alſo one who
in calamity could foreſee methods to extricate himſelf from it.
And ſurely nothing can be more unjuſt than what <hi>Rapin</hi> objects
againſt <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> in employing his wiſdom only in his own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
while all his companions were loſt: <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
refutes this objection, and directly tells us, that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his wiſdom in the care of their ſafety, but that they thro'
their folly defeated his wiſdom. The words of <hi>Homer,</hi> ſays <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtathius,</hi>
ſhew that a wiſe man neglects not his friends in adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But, ſays <hi>Rapin,</hi> what could oblige <hi>Homer</hi> to begin with ſo
diſhonourable an action, and place the greateſt weakneſs of his
Heroe in the very frontiſpiece of his Poem? and invoke his Muſe
to ſing the man who with difficulty ſaved himſelf, and ſuffer'd his
companions to be deſtroy'd? There had been ſome weight in this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0745000101:70"/>
objection, if <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> had ſaved his own, with the loſs of their lives;
but I cannot ſee any diſhonour, in his preſerving himſelf by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
when they deſtroy'd themſelves by folly: It was chiefly by
ſtorms that they periſh'd; it can be no imputation to his
character, not to be able to reſtrain the effects of a tempeſt:
he did all that a wiſe man cou'd do, he gave them ſuch admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon every emergency, that if they had purſued them, they
had been preſerved as well as <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi>

for the conduct and policy of a State: Therefore the quality
it requires is <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> but this virtue is of too large an extent
for the ſimplicity which a juſt and preciſe <hi>character</hi> requires; it
is therefore requiſite it ſhould be limited. The great art of Kings
is the myſtery of <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi> 'Tis well known, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the

Whence is it that <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> is ſaid to have overthrown <hi>Troy?</hi> and
not <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was of more remarkable courage than <hi>Ulyſſes?
Euſtathius</hi> tells us, that the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi> ought to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
chiefly to <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> as he not only took away the <hi>Palladium,</hi> but
was the inventor of the ſtratagem of the wooden horſe, by which
that city was conquer'd. <hi>Virgil</hi> in his ſecond book of the <hi>Aeneis</hi>

Poets; or that being a true Hiſtory it had ſpread over many

be, <q rend="inline">"Sing, oh Muſe, to the <hi>Greeks</hi> as well as to other nations, the

moſt natural: the reſt ſeem forced, and conſequently improper

he ſteps at once into the latter end of his actions, and
leaves the preceding ſtory to be told by way of narration. Thus
in his <hi>Iliad,</hi> he dates his Poem from the anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which
happen'd almoſt at the concluſion of the <hi>Trojan</hi> war. From hence

                  <p>This obſervation gives a reaſon why the Poet invokes the Muſe

an indecency in the Poet to have given countenance to that baſe

this reaſon, and tells us, that <hi>Homer</hi> gives <hi>Aegyſthus</hi> this title, to
vindicate <hi>Jupiter</hi> from the imputation of his crimes: He gives
us to underſtand that Heaven is not the cauſe of man's failings;
that he is by Creation able to act virtuouſly, and that it is thro'
his own miſconduct that he deviates into evil; and therefore the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0745000101:76"/>
meaning is this; <q rend="inline">"<hi>Jupiter</hi> calling to mind <hi>Aegyſthus,</hi> that <hi>Aegyſthus</hi>

even while he ſtands, or ſleeps; the firſt being his general character.
It may be further confirm'd by a paſſage ſomething reſembling it

It is the light of Nature, which Heaven implants in the breaſt of
every man: and which, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, is not only more ancient than
the world, but co-eval with the Maſter of the world himſelf. He
writes to this effect. <hi>There was from the beginning ſuch a thing as
Reaſon, a direct emanation from Nature it ſelf, which prompted to
good, and averted from evil. A Reaſon which did not then become
a law, when it was firſt reduced to writing, but was ſo even from
the moment it exiſted, and it exiſted from ever, of an equal date with the
divine Intelligence: It is the true and primordial Law, proper to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

                  <p>That Reaſon of the ſupreme Being, is here call'd <hi>Mercury</hi>; that
Reaſon flowing from God, which is conſtantly dictating to the

It implies either, <hi>one whoſe thoughts are full of terrible
and diſmal things,</hi> or, <hi>one who has infinite knowledge and unbounded
views,</hi> and 'tis doubtful which of them <hi>Homer</hi> means. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
both, may we not think our Author had heard ſomething
of the ancient tradition which makes <hi>Atlas</hi> the ſame perſon with
<hi>Enoch,</hi> and repreſents him as a great Aſtronomer, who prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd
of the univerſal deluge, and exhorted mankind to repentance?
Therefore he nam'd his ſon <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> to ſhow that after his
death the waters ſhou'd overſpread the face of the earth. His
continual lamentations on this occaſion caus'd him to be call'd the
<hi>Weeper,</hi> for the world is always an enemy to melancholy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
Thus <hi>Homer</hi> upon the credit of this Tradition might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well call <hi>Atlas, one whoſe thoughts ran upon diſmal things,</hi> or
<hi>one whoſe views and cares were vaſtly extended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I inſiſt no otherwiſe upon this but as a conjecture, yet it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <hi>ſuſtains thoſe Columns which being fixed upon the earth ſupport the
Heavens.</hi> This is generally interpreted of his great skill in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy
and Geography. But may not the reaſon be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular?
Since <hi>Atlas</hi> or <hi>Enoch</hi> had prophecy'd of the Deluge, and
ſince that prediction was looked upon as the effect of his skill in
Aſtronomy; might it not be ſaid he knew the abyſſes of the Sea,
and ſuſtain'd the pillars of Heaven, to expreſs that he knew how
the fountains of the deep and the waters above the Heavens ſhou'd
unite to drown the earth?</p>
                  <p>As to the image of the <hi>pillars of Heaven,</hi> it is frequent in the

                     </q>
                     <hi>Rapin</hi> has rais'd ſeveral objections againſt this piece of conduct in
<hi>Homer</hi>: He tells us that the action of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is imperfect,
that it begins with the voyages of <hi>Telemachus,</hi> and ends with thoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0745000101:81"/>
of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>: That the four firſt books are all concerning <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus:</hi>
That his voyage bears no proportion to that of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi>
that it contributes nothing to his return, which is brought about
by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Phaeacians</hi>; that this gave
occaſion to <hi>Beni</hi> in his <hi>academical diſcourſes</hi> to aſſert, that the
Fable of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is double, that the four firſt books of it are
neither Epiſode, nor part of an action, nor have any connexion
with the reſt of the work.</p>
                  <p>I am of opinion, that theſe objections are made with too
great ſeverity; The deſtruction of the Suitors is the chief hinge
upon which the Poem turns, as it contributes chiefly to the re-eſtabliſhment
of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in his country and regality; and whatever
contributes to this end, contributes to the principal action, and
is of a piece with the reſt of the Poem; and that this voyage
does ſo is evident, in that it gives a defeat to the Suitors, and
controuls their inſolence; it preſerves <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>'s throne and bed invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate,
in that it gives <hi>Telemachus</hi> courage to reſiſt their attempts:
It ſets his character in a fair point of light, who is the ſecond
perſonage of the Poem, and is to have a great ſhare in the future
actions of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſtathius</hi> judiciouſly obſerves, that <hi>Homer</hi> here prepares the
way for the defeat of the Suitors, the chief deſign of his Poem;
and lays the ground-work of probability on which he intends to
build his Poem, and reconcile it to the rules of credibility.</p>
                  <p>If it be ask'd for what end this voyage of <hi>Telemachus</hi> is made;
the anſwer is, to enquire after <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>: So that whatever Epiſodes
are interwoven, <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> is ſtill in view; and whatever <hi>Telemachus</hi>
acts, is undertaken ſolely upon his account; and conſequently,
whatever is acted, contributes to the principal deſign, the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> So that the Fable is entire, and the Action not
double.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be remember'd alſo, that the ſufferings of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> are
the ſubject of the Poem; his perſonal calamities are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but his domeſtic misfortunes; and by this conduct <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
ſhews us the extent of his misfortunes: His Queen is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,

                     <hi>Rapin</hi> is very ſevere upon this conduct. When <hi>Telemachus,</hi>

his thoughts, and aſſiſts in the execution. Could not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
duty, or nature, have moved his heart toward an abſent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
The Machine, adds he, has not the leaſt appearance of
probability, inaſmuch as the Goddeſs conducts him to every
place, except only where <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> reſides; of which ſhe ought by no
means to be ignorant, upon the account of her Divinity.</p>
                  <p>But ſurely nothing can be be more natural, than for a ſon, in
order to gain intelligence of an abſent father, to enquire in thoſe
places, and of thoſe perſons, where and from whom he is moſt
likely to have information. Such is the conduct of <hi>Telemachus:</hi>
And Poetry, which delights in the Wonderful, becauſe this conduct
agrees with wiſdom, aſcribes it to <hi>Minerva</hi> the Goddeſs of it.
No doubt but <hi>Minerva</hi> knew where <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> reſided: but men
muſt act as men: ſuch an immediate interpoſition as <hi>Rapin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
had ſtopp'd at once the fountain of the Poet's invention.
If what a Poet invents be natural, it is juſtifiable; and he may
give the rein to his imagination, if he reſtrain it from running
into extravagance and wildneſs.</p>

In this the Poet draws the out-lines of what he is to fill up in

We are told by tradition, that <hi>Homer</hi> was ſo ſenſible of friendſhip,
that to do honour to his particular friends, he immortalized their
names in his Poems. In the <hi>Iliad</hi> he has ſhewn his gratitude to
<hi>Tychius</hi>; and in the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> to <hi>Mentes, Phemius,</hi> and <hi>Mentor.</hi> This
<hi>Mentes</hi> was a famous Merchant of the iſle of <hi>Leucade,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Homer</hi> at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and made him his companion in all his
voyages. It is to this <hi>Mentes</hi> we owe the two Poems of <hi>Homer,</hi>

thoſe lights and informations he receiv'd, and the diſcoveries he

add one remark, that tho' he places his Maſter here in no very

that cannot be reduc'd to the rules of conſtruction. It ſhould be

to be uſed inſtead of the nominative? <hi>Mentes,</hi> adds he, may be
ſuppos'd to have intended to have ſaid <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

occurring, that requir'd an accuſative caſe, he falls into a
Soloeciſm.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps this is more ingenious than true; tho' <hi>Mentes</hi> was
in haſte when he ſpoke it, <hi>Homer</hi> was not when he compos'd it.
Might not an errour creep into the original by the negligence

                  <p>What <hi>Euſtathius</hi> adds is very abſurd: he ſays that <hi>Telemachus</hi>

ſend thy Mother away if thou doſt not love her; but if thou art

may be two reaſons why this is inſerted; either the Suitors were
pleas'd with the ſweetneſs of the ſong, or the ſubject of it;
they ſate attentive to hear the death of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> in the proceſs
of his ſtory. This gives us a reaſon why immediately <hi>Penelope</hi>
deſcended to ſtop the ſong; ſhe fear'd leſt he might touch
upon the ſtory of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> and ſay that he dy'd in his return. This
would have reduc'd her to the utmoſt neceſſity, and ſhe could
not have deferr'd to marry. <hi>Phemius</hi> would have certainly found
credit, for Poets were believ'd to be inſpir'd by the Gods; they
were look'd upon as Prophets, and to have ſomething of divinity
in them, as appears from <hi>Demodocus</hi> in the 8th book of the
<hi>Odyſſey.</hi> Beſides there was a further neceſſity to put a ſtop to the
ſong. If <hi>Phemius</hi> had declar'd him to be dead, <hi>Penelope</hi> could not
have avoided marriage; if alive, the Suitors might have deſiſted,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0745000101:94"/>
or arm'd themſelves againſt <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> and then their Deaths, one
of the principal incidents of the Poem, could not have follow'd;
neither could <hi>Telemachus</hi> have gone in ſearch of his father, if he
had foreknown his death, or ſudden return. It is therefore art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Poet to cut the ſong ſhort, he reſerves the ſtory of
<hi>Ulyſſes</hi> for future narration, and brings all this about by a very
probable method, by the interpoſition of <hi>Penelope,</hi> who requeſts
that ſome other ſtory may be choſen, a ſtory that ſhe can hear

                  <hi>Telemachus,</hi> in the aſſembly of the Lords of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> complains of
the injuſtice done him by the Suitors, and inſiſts upon their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from his Palace; appealing to the Princes, and exciting the
people to declare againſt them. The Suitors endeavour to juſtify
their ſtay, at leaſt till he ſhall ſend the Queen to the Court of
<hi>Icarius</hi> her father; which he refuſes. There appears a prodigy of
two Eagles in the sky, which an Augur expounds to the ruin of
the Suitors. <hi>Telemachus</hi> then demands a veſſel, to carry him to
<hi>Pylos</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> there to enquire of his father's fortunes. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS book opens with the firſt appearance
of <hi>Telemachus</hi> upon the ſtage of action. And
<hi>Boſſu</hi> obſerves the great judgment of the
Poet, in beginning with the tranſactions of
<hi>Ithaca</hi> in the abſence of <hi>Ulyſſes:</hi> By this
method he ſets the conduct of <hi>Telemachus,</hi>
                     <hi>Penelope,</hi> and the Suitors, in a ſtrong point
of light; they all have a large ſhare in the
ſtory of the Poem, and conſequently ought to have diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
characters. It is as neceſſary in Epic Poetry, as it is on the
Theatre, to let us immediately into the character of every perſon
whom the Poet introduces: This adds perſpicuity to the ſtory,
and we immediately grow acquainted with each perſonage, and
intereſt our ſelves in the good or ill fortune that attends them
thro' the whole relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Telemachus</hi> is now about twenty years of age: In the eleventh
book, the Poet tells us, he was an infant in the arms of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> ſail'd to <hi>Troy</hi>; that Heroe was abſent near twenty
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0745000101:127"/>
years, and from hence we may gather the exact age of <hi>Telema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
He is every where deſcrib'd as a perſon of piety to the Gods,
of duty to his parents, and as a lover of his country: he is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
temperate, and valiant: and the Poet well ſets off the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of this young Heroe, by giving him the Goddeſs of
War and Wiſdom for his conſtant attendant.</p>

paſſage has not eſcap'd the raillery of the Critics; they look upon
it as a mean deſcription of a Heroe and a Prince, to give him a
brace of dogs only for his guards or attendants: But ſuch was
the ſimplicity of ancient Princes, that except in war they had
rarely any attendants or equipage. And we may be confident,
<hi>Homer</hi> copies after the cuſtom of the time, unleſs we can be ſo

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0745000101:129"/>
is here related: What muſt a kingdom ſuffer in twenty years,

<hi>Telemachus</hi> to this time, in his minority.</p>
                  <p>It is very artful in the Poet to open the aſſembly by <hi>Aegyptius:
Telemachus</hi> was the perſon who conven'd it; and being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
perſonage preſent, it might be expected that he ſhould open
the deſign of it: But to give <hi>Telemachus</hi> courage, who was young

who had ſummon'd them (of whom he ſeems ignorant) gives <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemachus</hi>
to underſtand he has friends among the aſſembly: This
he could no other way ſo ſafely have done, conſidering the

They think it unworthy of <hi>Telemachus</hi> to make the Dower of
<hi>Penelope</hi> an argument againſt her diſmiſſion, and conſequently
aſcribe his detention of her, not to duty, but to covetouſneſs. To
take away this objection they point the verſes in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

                     <hi>Dacier</hi> diſlikes this ſolution, and appeals to the cuſtoms of
thoſe Ages, to juſtify her opinion: If a ſon forc'd away his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from his houſe, he was obliged to reſtore her dower, and all
ſhe brought in marriage to her husband: But if ſhe retir'd volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
to engage in a ſecond marriage, the dower remain'd with
the ſon as lawful heir. This opinion of <hi>Dacier</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
from <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> in his orations, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<hi>Afterwards upon the deceaſe of her husband, leaving his family, and
receiving back her portion,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame Author adds, that the
reaſon why the Suitors are ſo urgent to ſend away <hi>Penelope,</hi> is
that ſhe may chuſe to marry ſome one of them, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Icarius</hi>; ſo that <hi>Telemachus</hi> only takes hold of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for her diſmiſſion, in order to detain her. They addreſs'd
<hi>Penelope</hi> more for the ſake of her riches than her beauty, (for ſhe
muſt be about forty years old) and he tells them, that if he ſends
her away againſt her conſent, he muſt reſtore thoſe riches, which
they covet more than the perſon of <hi>Penelope.</hi> This I confeſs is
very refin'd; and perhaps it may be ſufficient to take off the objection
of covetouſneſs in <hi>Telemachus,</hi> to underſtand no more than what
the words at the firſt view ſeem to imply, <hi>viz.</hi> an abhorrence of
their riots, deſcrib'd by <hi>Telemachus</hi> to have riſen to ſuch a degree
as to have almoſt ruin'd his kingdom, and made their demands
impoſſible. I ſee nothing unnatural or mean in this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
eſpecially if we remember that the prodigious diſorders of
his family enter into the eſſence of the Poem. The greater the
diſorders are, the greater are the ſufferings of <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi>

                  <p>Perhaps it may be objected, that there is not a ſufficient diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

as inſolent voluptuaries. But tho' they agree in this general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
yet there is ſomething diſtinguiſhing in the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
Thus <hi>Antinous</hi> derides, <hi>Eurymachus</hi> covers villany with
mildneſs; <hi>Antinous</hi> is ever the foremoſt in outrage, <hi>Eurymachus</hi>
generally his ſecond: A greater diſtinction is neither neceſſary,
nor poſſible to be repreſented. What the Poet is to deſcribe, is
the inſolence of the Suitors, and the diſorders they create in
his family and kingdom; he is oblig'd to dwell upon theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
becauſe they are eſſential to his deſign: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that general reſemblance of their characters, is not a fault
in the Poet.</p>

Such paſſages as theſe have ever furniſh'd Critics with matter of

I confeſs, ſuch deſcriptions now would be ridiculous in a

It is a true obſervation, that the <hi>Iliad</hi> is chiefly ſuitable to the
condition of Kings and Heroes; and conſequently fill'd with
circumſtances in which the greateſt part of mankind can have
no concern or intereſt: The <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is of more general uſe; the
ſtory of it is a ſeries of calamities, which concern every man, as
every man may feel them. We can bring the ſufferings of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes</hi>
in ſome degree home to our ſelves, and make his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
our own; but what private perſon can ever be in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> or <hi>Achilles?</hi> What I would infer from
this is, that the Reader ought not to take offence at any ſuch
deſcriptions, which are only mean as they differ from the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the latter ages. In the <hi>Iliad, Achilles</hi> when he acts
in the common offices of life, and not as an Heroe, is liable to
the ſame objection. But if the manners of the antient ages be
conſider'd, we ſhall be reconcil'd to the actions of the antient
Heroes; and conſequently to <hi>Homer.</hi>

                  <p>This Book takes up the ſpace of one day and one night: it
opens with the morning; the ſpeeches in the Council, with
the preparations for the voyage of <hi>Telemachus,</hi> are the ſubject of
the day; and the voyage is finiſh'd by the next morning. By
this laſt circumſtance we may learn that <hi>Ithaca</hi> was diſtant from
<hi>Pylos</hi> but one night's voyage, nay ſomething leſs, there being
ſome time ſpent after the ſetting of the Sun, in carrying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
from the Palace to the veſſel.</p>

The book conſiſts chiefly in the ſpeeches of <hi>Telemachus</hi> and
his friends, againſt thoſe of the Suitors. It ſhews the great
judgment of the Poet in chuſing this method: hence we ſee the
cauſes preceding the effects; and know from what ſpring every
action flow'd: we are never at a loſs for a reaſon for every inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
the ſpeeches are as it were the ground-work upon which
he builds all that relates to the adventures of <hi>Telemachus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Iliad,</hi> after the diſſolution of the Council in the firſt book,
and the diſſenſion between <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> we immediately
ſee upon what hinge the fable turns. So in the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> after the
Poet has laid before us the warm debates between the Suitors
and <hi>Telemachus,</hi> we immediately expect them to act as enemies:
The war is declar'd, and we become judges as well as ſpectators
of the ſcenes of action. Thus <hi>Homer</hi> adds the perſpicuity of
Hiſtory to the ornaments of Poetry.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Scene is now remov'd from <hi>Ithaca</hi> to
<hi>Pylos,</hi> and with it a new vein of Poetry is
opened: Inſtead of the riots of the Suitors,
we are entertain'd with the wiſdom and
piety of <hi>Neſtor.</hi> This and the following
book are a kind of Supplement to the <hi>Iliad</hi>;
the nature of Epic poetry requires that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould be left to the imagination of
the Reader, nor is the picture to be entirely drawn at full
length. <hi>Homer</hi> therefore, to ſatisfie our curioſity, gives an
account of the fortunes of thoſe great men, who made ſo
noble a figure at the ſiege of <hi>Troy.</hi> This conduct alſo
ſhews his art: Variety gives life and delight; and it is
much more neceſſary in Epic than in Comic or Tragic Poetry
ſometimes to ſhift the Scenes, to diverſify and embelliſh the ſtory.
But as on the ſtage the Poet ought not to ſtep at once from one
part of the world to a too remote country, (for this deſtroys credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and the auditor cannot fancy himſelf this minute here, and
the next a thouſand miles diſtant) ſo in Epic Poetry, every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0745000101:185"/>
muſt be within the degrees of probability. We have here
a very eaſy tranſition; the Poet carries his Heroe no further than
he really might ſail in the compaſs of time he allots for his voyage.
If he had ſtill dwelt upon the diſorders of the Suitors without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
he muſt grow tireſome; but he artfully breaks the thread
of their Hiſtory with beautiful incidents and Epiſodes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the further recital of their diſorders for the end of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em:
By this method we ſit down with freſh appetite to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
and riſe at laſt not cloy'd, but ſatisfied.</p>

there were nine cities ſubject to the power of <hi>Neſtor</hi>: five in
<hi>Pylos,</hi> the reſt in <hi>Boeotia</hi>; the Poet therefore allots one Bank or
Theatre to every city, which conſiſted of 500 men, the whole
number amounting to 4500: Theſe cities furniſh'd the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of men to <hi>Neſtor</hi> for the war at <hi>Troy</hi>: He ſail'd in ninety
veſſels, and allowing fifty men to each veſſel, they amount to
that number. Hence it appears that this was a national ſacrifice,
every city furniſh'd nine bulls, and by conſequence the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were partakers of it.</p>

offer'd, whether in a Temple, or in the open air. But <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi>

great reverence to <hi>Neſtor:</hi> the modeſty of the one, and

the ſame picture of <hi>Neſtor</hi> in the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> that was drawn of him

It may ſeem at firſt view, that the Poet affirms the night to be an
improper ſeaſon to convene a Council. This is not his meaning;
In the <hi>Iliad,</hi> there are ſeveral councils by night; nay, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

What therefore <hi>Neſtor</hi> here condemns is the calling not a ſelect,
but public aſſembly of the ſoldiers in the night; when they are
in no danger of an enemy, and when they are apt to fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
inſolence thro' wine, and the joy of victory. The night is
then undoubtedly an ill choſen ſeaſon: becauſe the licence of the
ſoldier cannot be ſo well reſtrain'd by night as by day. <bibl>

that all the <hi>Greeks</hi> would riſe in the cauſe of <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> What the Suitors
had ſpoken ſcoffingly in the preceding book, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Telemachus</hi>
was ſailing to <hi>Pyle</hi> or <hi>Sparta</hi> for <hi>ſupplies,</hi> appears in this not to
be impracticable; ſo that it was choice and not neceſſity that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd

It may be added, that the very nature of Epic Poetry, and of
the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> in particular, requires ſuch a conduct: In the <hi>Iliad
Achilles</hi> is the chief agent, and performs almoſt all the great actions;
<hi>Aeneas</hi> is painted after the ſame manner by <hi>Virgil</hi>; the one kills
<hi>Hector,</hi> the other <hi>Turnus,</hi> both which are the deciſive actions: It
was equally neceſſary to exalt the character of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> by bringing
him into difficulties from which he is perſonally to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
This the Poet ſufficiently brings about by refuſing all the
eaſy methods for his re-eſtabliſhment, becauſe the more difficult
ways are moſt conducive to the honour of his Heroe: Thus as
<hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> kill <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Turnus</hi> with their own hands, ſo
the Suitors fall chiefly by the hand of <hi>Ulyſſes:</hi> It is neceſſary for
the Heroe of the Poem to execute the deciſive action, for by this
method the Poet compleats his character, his own greatneſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
all difficulties, and he goes off the ſtage with the utmoſt
advantage, by leaving a noble character upon the mind of the
ſpectators.</p>

'Tis true, the Poet makes <hi>Minerva</hi> herſelf correct it; but yet the
objection remains, <hi>viz.</hi> how could <hi>Telemachus</hi> ſpeak it? I think
ſince the Poet himſelf condemns it, we may give it up as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency
in <hi>Telemachus</hi>; it is natural for men in deſpair (and that
was the condition of <hi>Telemachus</hi>) to uſe a vehemence of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and this might tranſport <hi>Telemachus</hi> beyond the bounds of
prudence. The only poſſible way that occurs to me to take off
the impiety is to have recourſe to Deſtiny: It was the opinion
of the Antients, that the Gods could not alter Deſtiny: and then
<hi>Telemachus</hi> may mean no more, than that it was decreed by the
Deſtinies that <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> ſhall return no more, ſo the Gods themſelves

obſerves upon this paſſage, that he who enquires any thing
of an old man, tho' the old man himſelf has no concern in the
ſtory, wins his heart at once; and incites a perſon, who is upon
all occaſions very willing to diſcourſe. He introduces this as an
inſtance of the art <hi>Telemachus</hi> uſes, in adapting himſelf by his
queſtions to the temper of the perſon with whom he converſes:
He puts together, continues he, ſeveral queſtions upon ſeveral
ſubjects, which is more judicious than to confine his anſwer to a
ſingle interrogatory, and by that method deprive <hi>Neſtor</hi> of one of
the moſt pleaſant enjoyments of old age, I mean the pleaſure of
talking. <hi>Plutarch Sympoſiac.</hi>

which is computed to be about thirty years. I refer the Reader

theſe and other paſſages, we may learn the ſtate of Poetry in
thoſe ages: <q rend="inline">"Poets (ſays <hi>Euſtathius</hi>) were rank'd in the claſs of

'till he baniſh'd the Poet, who was her guide and inſtructor.</p>
                  <p>Various are the conjectures of the Ancients about the name
of the Bard here celebrated: Some, ſays <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> tell us, it was
<hi>Chariades,</hi> ſome <hi>Demodocus,</hi> ſome <hi>Glaucus, &amp;c.</hi> but I paſs them
over, becauſe they are conjectures.</p>
                  <p>There were many degrees of theſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

by Kings and Princes.</p>
                  <p>I cannot omit one remark of <hi>Euſtathius</hi>: he tells us, that ſome

it admirably paints the advantage we draw from wiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
for the improvement of our Virtues: <hi>Clytemneſtra</hi> was

guard to her modeſty. It was long before ſhe yielded;
virtue and honour had a long conteſt: but ſhe no ſooner yielded
to adultery, but ſhe aſſiſted in the murder of her husband; from
whence we may draw another moral, that one vice betrays us
into another, and when once the fences of honour are thrown
down, we become a prey to every paſſion. <bibl>

obſerve that ſea a whole year, he would not ſee one bird flying

an unlawful cuſtom, thro' the fear of falling into any inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies

dealt in incantations perform'd their ſacrifices to the infernal
powers by night, and finiſh'd them before ſun-riſing. Either of
theſe reaſons ſufficiently explains the words of the Goddeſs; and
the former carries in it an excellent moral, that particular care

                     </q> I will
take this opportunity to obviate an objection that may be made
againſt all interpoſition of the Gods in aſſiſting the Heroes of the
<hi>Odyſſey:</hi> It has been thought by ſome Critics a diſparagement to
them to ſtand in continual need of ſuch ſupernatural ſuccour: If
two perſons were engaged in combat, and a third perſon ſhould
immediately ſtep in to the aſſiſtance of one of the parties and
kill the adverſary, would it not reflect upon the valour of his
friend who was ſo weak as to want ſuch aſſiſtance? Why, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſhould <hi>Jupiter</hi> help <hi>Aeneas</hi> to kill <hi>Turnus?</hi> Was not he brave
enough to fight, and ſtrong enough to conquer his enemy by his
own proweſs? and would not <hi>Turnus</hi> have kill'd <hi>Aeneas</hi> with the ſame
aſſiſtance? It is therefore a diſparagement to the actors, thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to ſupply the defects of a Heroe, by the power of a Deity.</p>
                  <p>But this is a falſe way of arguing, and from hence it might
be infer'd that the love and favour of a Deity ſerves only to make
thoſe whom he aſſiſts, and thoſe who depend upon ſuch aſſiſtance,
appear weak, impotent, cowardly, and unworthy to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
Can any doubt ariſe whether the love and favour of a God
be a diſparagement or honour to thoſe whom he favours? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to theſe Critics, we ſhould find the character of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Heroe in an impious <hi>Mezentius,</hi> who acknowledges no God
but his own arm and his own ſword: 'Tis true, the objection
would be juſt if the Heroe himſelf perform'd nothing of the
action; or if when he were almoſt conquer'd by the ſuperior va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of his enemy, he ow'd his life and victory to Gods
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0745000101:206"/>
and Miracles: But the Heroe always behaves himſelf in all his
actions, as if he were to gain ſucceſs without the aſſiſtance of
the Deity; and the preſence of the Gods is ſo order'd, that we
may retrench every thing that is miraculous, without making
any alteration in the action or character of the human perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Thus in the inſtance of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> tho' <hi>Jupiter</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet <hi>Aeneas</hi> is painted in ſtronger colours of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he appears ſuperior, as a man unaſſiſted, and able to conquer
<hi>Turnus</hi>; and conſequently the favour of <hi>Jupiter</hi> makes no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the action or character of <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe a wide difference between the aſſiſtance of a
Man, and of a God: The actions of men belong only to the
performers of thoſe actions, but when a Deity aſſiſts us by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
us with ſtrength and courage, the actions we perform are
really our own, and the more he favours us the more glory he
gives us: ſo that the aſſiſtance of man eclipſes, but the aſſiſtance of
a God exalts, our glory. Thus for inſtance, when <hi>Achilles</hi> is
purſuing <hi>Hector,</hi> he charges the <hi>Greeks</hi> to keep off from <hi>Hector</hi>;
their aſſiſtance might leſſen his glory: but when <hi>Pallas</hi> offers her
aſſiſtance he immediately embraces it as an honour, and boaſts of it
as ſuch to <hi>Hector.</hi> I have been large upon this objection, becauſe
the Reader ought to carry it in his memory thro' the whole Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,
and apply it to every action, in which any ſhare is aſcribed
to any Deity. See <hi>Boſſu</hi> more at large concerning this objection.</p>

ſome act of regality, in the diſpatch of juſtice, or other ſolemn

conſecrated with oil, to draw a reverence to the ſeats of Juſtice,
as by an act of religion; but I rather judge (adds ſhe) that no
more is meant than to expreſs the ſhining of theſe thrones, they
being undoubtedly made of marble.</p>

<hi>Homer</hi> from this objection, in his reflections upon <hi>Longinus</hi>;
this Gilder was a gold-beater; <hi>Neſtor</hi> we ſee furniſh'd the gold,
and he beat it into leaves, ſo that he had occaſion to make uſe of
his anvil and hammer; the anvil was portable, becauſe the work
was not laborious. Our modern travellers aſſure us, that it is at

It is very neceſſary to ſay ſomething about this practice of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
bathing and anointing men; it frequently occurs thro' the
whole <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> and is ſo contrary to the uſage of the moderns as
to give offence to modeſty; neither is this done by women of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
quality, but we have here a young Princeſs, bathing, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and cloathing the naked <hi>Telemachus. Euſtathius</hi> indeed tells us,
it was undoubtedly by her father's command: but if it was a
piece of immodeſty, it does not ſolve the objection, whoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it. I confeſs it would be immodeſt in theſe ages of the
world, and the only excuſe that occurs to me is, to ſay that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
eſtabliſh'd it. It is in manners, in ſome degree, as in dreſs;
if a faſhion never ſo indecent prevails, yet no perſon is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
becauſe it is faſhionable; ſo in manners, if a practice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
univerſally, tho' not reconcilable to real modeſty, yet no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can be ſaid to be immodeſt who comes into it, becauſe it is
agreeable to the cuſtom of the times and countries.</p>

what I have further to obſerve on the concluſion of this book:
It is remarkable that the Poet does not amuſe himſelf in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the preſent he receiv'd from <hi>Neſtor,</hi> or the proviſions for the
journey, or even the journey it ſelf at large; he diſpatches the
whole in a few lines very judiciouſly; he carries his Heroe directly
to <hi>Menelaus,</hi> who is to furniſh many incidents that contribute to
the deſign of the Poem, and paſſes over other matters as unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>We have here likewiſe a piece of poetical Geography, and learn
that it is exactly two days journey from <hi>Pyle</hi> to <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi>

                  <p>This book takes up three days; the firſt is ſpent in the enquiries
<hi>Telemachus</hi> makes of <hi>Neſtor</hi> concerning <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>; the two laſt in the

<hi>Lacedaemon</hi>; ſo that five days have now paſs'd ſince the opening
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0745000101:211"/>

the moſt exact deſcription of the ſacrifices as practis'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
perhaps extant in any Author; I refer to the obſervations
upon the firſt book of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would here remark that the three firſt books are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with the utmoſt ſimplicity, there has been no room for ſuch
exalted ſtrokes of Poetry as are to be found in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> or
in the future parts of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi>: But this is not owing to the
decay of genius in <hi>Homer,</hi> as ſome Critics have affirm'd, (who
look upon the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> as bearing marks of his declining years,)
but to the nature of the ſubject. The characters of <hi>Achilles</hi> and
<hi>Ulyſſes</hi> are both very great, but very different. The <hi>Iliad</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of battles, and a continual commotion; the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Wiſdom: and conſequently the ſtyle of the two Poems
muſt be as different as the characters of the two Heroes. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fountain of Poetry opens in the next book, and flows with
an uninterrupted courſe almoſt through the whole <hi>Odyſſey.</hi>

why ſhould <hi>Minerva</hi> abſent her ſelf from <hi>Menelaus,</hi> when the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the nuptials is the only reaſon of the abſence of
that Goddeſs? and as for muſic and dancing being contrary to
the ſevere manners of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> this is all conjecture:
<hi>Menelaus</hi> lived more than three hundred years before <hi>Lycurgus</hi>;
and becauſe ſuch diverſions were forbid in <hi>Sparta</hi> in the days of
<hi>Lycurgus,</hi> muſt it follow that they were not uſed in thoſe of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus?</hi>
And ſhould it be granted that muſic and dancing were
not uſed in his times, might he not relax a little from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of his times, upon ſuch an occaſion of joy as the marriage
of a ſon and daughter? I am ſure theſe diverſions are not more
contrary to the ſeverity of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> than the magnificence of

imply that they breed in three ſeaſons of the year, and not only
in the ſpring as in other countries; or that the ſheep have at

I fancy there may be a more rational account given of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
The time of feaſting was ever look'd upon as a time of
joy, and thankſgiving to the Gods; it bore a religious venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among the Ancients, and conſequently to ſhed tears when
they ſhould expreſs their gratitude to the Gods with joy, was
eſteem'd a prophanation.</p>

fiction of <hi>Homer,</hi> as <hi>Dacier</hi> obſerves, might be this. <hi>Diodorus</hi>
writes that in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and chiefly at <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> the ſame with

lived women who boaſted of certain potions which not only

But that there may be ſomething more than fiction in this is very

reported by the ancients to have been the inventor of phyſic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

                  <p>It is further ſaid of <hi>Thon,</hi> that he was King of <hi>Canopus,</hi> and

falling in love with her, and offering violence, he was ſlain
by <hi>Menelaus.</hi> From his name the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> gave the name of
<hi>Thoth</hi> to the firſt month of their year, and alſo to a city the
name of <hi>Thonis. Aelian</hi> writes that <hi>Menelaus</hi> when he travell'd

<hi>Thonis,</hi> who receiv'd <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Menelaus. Herodotus</hi> relates, that

ſhews the neceſſity of the appearance of <hi>Helen,</hi> no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

<hi>Perſian</hi> (as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> obſerves) practis'd it, as we learn from
hiſtory. We may reaſonably conjecture that <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Helen,</hi> in hopes that he would diſcover the affairs of the
army more freely to her than any other perſon: for what could
be more agreeable to a <hi>Greek,</hi> than to be committed to the care
of a <hi>Greek,</hi> as <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> was to <hi>Helen?</hi> By the ſame conduct the
Poet raiſes the character of <hi>Helen,</hi> by making her ſhew her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
by an act of generoſity to her countryman. The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſays ſhe gave an oath to <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> not to diſcover him before
he was in Safety in the <hi>Grecian</hi> army: Now this does not imply

to take her oath that ſhe would not diſcover him, 'till he was

is the obſervation of <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> that theſe words are very artful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
introduced to vindicate <hi>Helen</hi>; They imply that what ſhe acted
was by compulſion, and to evidence this more clearly, <hi>Deiphobus</hi> is
given her for an attendant as a ſpy upon her actions, that ſhe might
not conceal any thing that ſhould happen, but act her part well
by endeavouring to deceive the <hi>Greeks</hi> in favour of <hi>Troy.</hi> It is
the Daemon, not <hi>Helen,</hi> that is in fault; this, continues <hi>Euſtathius,</hi>
anſwers many objections that lye againſt <hi>Helen</hi>; for if ſhe was a
real penitent, as ſhe her ſelf affirms, how comes ſhe to endeavour
to deceive the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by the diſguiſe of her voice, into more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
than had yet ariſen from a ten years war? Or indeed is it
credible that any perſon could modulate her voice ſo artfully as
to reſemble ſo many voices? And how could the <hi>Greeks</hi> encloſed
in the wooden horſe believe that their wives who were in <hi>Greece,</hi>
could be arriv'd in ſo ſhort a ſpace as they had been conceal'd
there, from the various regions of <hi>Greece,</hi> and meet together in
<hi>Troy?</hi> Would the wives of theſe Heroes come into an enemy's
country, when the whole army, except theſe latent Heroes, were
retir'd from it? this is ridiculous and impoſſible. I muſt confeſs
there is great weight in theſe objections: But <hi>Euſtathius</hi> anſwers
all by the interpoſition of the Daemon; and by an idle tradition
that <hi>Helen</hi> had the name of <hi>Echo,</hi> from the faculty of mimicking
ſounds; and that this gift was beſtow'd upon her by <hi>Venus</hi> when
ſhe married <hi>Menelaus,</hi> that ſhe might be able to detect him if he
ſhould prove falſe to her bed, by imitating the voice of the ſuſpected
perſon: (but <hi>Menelaus</hi> had more occaſion for this faculty than <hi>Helen.</hi>)
As for the excuſe of the Daemon, it equally excuſes all crimes: For
inſtance, was <hi>Helen</hi> falſe to <hi>Menelaus?</hi> The Daemon occaſion'd it:
Does ſhe act an impoſture to deſtroy all her <hi>Grecian</hi> friends, and even
<hi>Menelaus?</hi> The Daemon compells her to it: The Daemon compells
her to go with <hi>Deiphobus,</hi> to ſurround the horſe thrice, to ſound the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0745000101:289"/>
ſides of it, to endeavour to ſurprize the latent <hi>Greeks</hi> by an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the voices of their wives, and in ſhort, to act like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that was very ſincere in miſchief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dacier</hi> takes another courſe, and gives up <hi>Helen,</hi> but remarks
the great addreſs of <hi>Menelaus. Helen</hi> had, ſaid ſhe, long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
nothing ſo much as to return to <hi>Lacedaemon</hi>; and her
heart had long been wholly turn'd to <hi>Menelaus: Menelaus</hi> is not
at all convinc'd of this pretended ſincerity; but it would have
been too groſs, after he had taken her again to his bed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
her of falſhood: He therefore contents himſelf barely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that ſome Daemon, an enemy to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> had forc'd her to
a conduct diſagreeable to her ſincerity. This (continues <hi>Dacier</hi>)
is an artful, but ſevere Irony.</p>
                  <p>As for the objection concerning the impoſſibility of the <hi>Greeks</hi>
believing their wives could be in <hi>Troy</hi>; ſhe anſwers, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of this objection have not ſufficiently conſider'd human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The voice of a belov'd perſon might of a ſudden, and by
ſurprize, draw from any perſon a word involuntary, before he has
time to make reflection. This undoubtedly is true, where cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
make an impoſture probable; but here is an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
it is utterly impoſſible to believe the wives of theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
could be in <hi>Troy.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Menelaus</hi> himſelf tells us, that
even he had fallen into the ſnare, but <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> prevented it; this
adds to the incredibility of the ſtory, for if this faculty of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickry
was given upon his marriage with <hi>Helen,</hi> it was nothing
new to him, he muſt be ſuppos'd to be acquainted with it, and
conſequently be the leſs liable to ſurprize: Nay it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
but the experiment might have been made upon him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Helen</hi> fled away with <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I think this paſſage wants a further vindication: the

his Poetry been worſe if he had deſcrib'd the real diſtance of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros?</hi>
It is allowable in a Poet to diſguiſe the truth, to adorn his

<hi>Bochart</hi> has fully prov'd that there is no acceſſion to the

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0745000101:292"/>
the violent agitation of the ſeas prohibit it from lodging, and

his ſilence about them is not an argument of his ignorance, for

does not enter fully into the meaning of <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi>: <hi>Eratoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi>
does not mean that <hi>Homer</hi> was ignorant of the mouths of
<hi>Nile</hi> from his ſilence, but becauſe he places <hi>Pharos</hi> at the diſtance
of a whole day's ſail from the Continent. The only way to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
this inconſiſtence is to ſuppoſe, that the Poet intended to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify
the <hi>Peluſiac</hi> mouth of <hi>Nile,</hi> from which <hi>Pharos</hi> ſtands about
a day's ſail: but this is ſubmitted to the Critics.</p>
                  <p>I can't tell whether one ſhould venture to make uſe of the
word <hi>Nile</hi> in the tranſlation, it is doubtleſs an Anachroniſm;
that name being unknown in the times of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Menelaus,</hi>

                  <p>It may not perhaps be diſagreeable to the Reader to obſerve,
that <hi>Virgil</hi> has borrow'd this ſtory of <hi>Proteus</hi> from <hi>Homer,</hi> and
tranſlated it almoſt literally. <hi>Rapine</hi> ſays, that <hi>Homer</hi>'s deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is more ingenious and fuller of invention, but <hi>Virgil</hi>'s more
judicious. I wiſh that Critic had given his reaſons for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
I believe in general, the plan of the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is
allow'd by the beſt of Critics to be more perfect than that of the
<hi>Aeneis. Homer</hi> with reſpect to the unity of time, has the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
very manifeſtly; <hi>Rapine</hi> confeſſes it, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> propoſes
him as an example to all Epic Authors. Where then is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of judgment? Is it that there are more fabulous, I mean
incredible, ſtories in <hi>Homer</hi> than <hi>Virgil?</hi> as that of the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> the
ſhips of <hi>Alcinous, &amp;c. Virgil</hi> has imitated moſt of theſe bold
fables, and the ſtory of the ſhips of <hi>Alcinous</hi> is not more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
than the transformation of the ſhips of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> But this is too
large a ſubject to be diſcuſs'd in the compaſs of theſe Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
In particular paſſages I freely allow the preference to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
as in the deſcent of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in this ſtory
of <hi>Proteus,</hi> I cannot ſee any ſuperiority of judgment. <hi>Virgil</hi> is
little more than a tranſlator; to ſhew the particulars would be
too tedious: I refer it to the Reader to compare the two Authors,
and ſhall only inſtance in one paſſage.

This is the reaſon why <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> (as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> obſerves upon the

<hi>Diomedes</hi>; ſo that the ſame ſpirit of Wiſdom reign'd in <hi>Telema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
that was ſo remarkable in <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> This is the reaſon why
<hi>Menelaus</hi> ſmil'd; it was not at the frankneſs or ſimplicity of
<hi>Telemachus,</hi> but it was a ſmile of joy, to ſee the young Prince
inherit his father's wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>It is the remark of <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> that <hi>Telemachus</hi> is far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
the nature of his country; he confeſſes it to be barren,
and more barren than the neighbouring Iſlands; yet that natural
and laudable affection which all worthy perſons have for their
country makes him prefer it to places of a more happy ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This appears to me a replication to what <hi>Menelaus</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0745000101:300"/>
offer'd concerning the tranſplantation of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> to <hi>Sparta</hi>; this

that this depended upon the uncertainty they were yet

opinion is, that the nature of Epic Poetry requires a contrary
conduct: The Heroe of the Poem is to be the chief agent, and
the re-eſtabliſhment of his fortunes muſt be owing to his own
wiſdom and valour. I have enlarg'd upon this already, ſo that

We have here an imaginary Being introduc'd by the Poet: The
whole is manag'd with great judgment; It is ſhort, becauſe it has
not a direct and immediate relation to the progreſs of the Poem,
and becauſe ſuch imaginary entercourſes have ever been looked
upon as ſudden in appearance, and as ſudden in vaniſhing away.
The uſe the Poet makes of it, is to relieve <hi>Penelope</hi> from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of deſpair, that ſhe may act her part in the future ſcenes
with courage and conſtancy. We ſee it is <hi>Minerva</hi> who ſends this
phantom to <hi>Penelope</hi> to comfort her: Now this is an allegory to
expreſs that as ſoon as the violence of ſorrow was over,
the mind of <hi>Penelope</hi> return'd to ſome degree of tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<hi>Minerva</hi> is no more than the reſult of her own refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and wiſdom, which baniſh'd from her breaſt thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
apprehenſions. The manner likewiſe of its intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
is not leſs judicious; the mind is apt to dwell upon
thoſe objects in ſleep which make a deep impreſſion when
awake: This is the foundation of the Poet's fiction; it is
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0745000101:305"/>
no more than a dream which he here deſcribes, but he cloaths it
with a body, gives it a momentary exiſtence, and by this method
exalts a low circumſtance into dignity and Poetry.</p>

We ought not to reproach <hi>Penelope</hi> for this ſeemingly ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declaration, in preferring a ſon to an husband: Her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is natural and juſt; ſhe had all the reaſon in the world to
believe that <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> was dead, ſo that all her hopes, all her
affection was entirely placed upon <hi>Telemachus:</hi> His loſs therefore
muſt unavoidably touch her with the higheſt degree of ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
if he is loſt, ſhe can have recourſe to no ſecond comfort. But
why may we not allow the reaſon which <hi>Penelope</hi> her ſelf gives
for this ſuperiority of ſorrow for <hi>Telemachus?</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"<hi>Telemachus,</hi> ſays
ſhe, is unexperienc'd in the world, and unable to contend with
difficulties; whereas <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> knew how to extricate himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

fear more for <hi>Telemachus</hi> than <hi>Ulyſſes:</hi> Her affection might be

ask'd what is the reaſon of this conduct, and why ſhould the

all, but chiefly to his wife, as will appear in the proſecution of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0745000101:306"/>
the ſtory: The queſtion is very natural for an affectionate wife
