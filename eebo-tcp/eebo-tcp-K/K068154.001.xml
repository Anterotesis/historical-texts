            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If ever dedication had a legitimate motive, this has.</p>
            <p>The recollection of a friend's having witneſſed the firſt dawnings of my poetical and muſical ideas—his kind partiality to them—his friendſhip and liberality in promoting a ſcheme for my benefit—his handſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in forgetting that, at the inſtigation of unprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled men, I believed him to have been unfaithful to his promiſes: In fine, the variety of inſtances in which he has proved himſelf ſuch a friend as no man but myſelf could ever boaſt of:—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0259200901:6"/>
Theſe not only point out the moſt perfect propriety in my making an acknowledgment of my obligations, but would alſo mark me as very unworthy of them if I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to ſeize ſo becoming an opportunity of inviting the public to bear teſtimony to my high ſenſe of ſuch kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>You, Sir, are the friend thus deſcribed. The facts I have ſpoken of exiſt. And, as I ſlatter myſelf you will allow that ingratitude makes no part of my diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it cannot ſurprize you that I endeavour to do you common juſtice.</p>
            <p>So well, however, do I know you, that you will wonder I ſhould conceive it neceſſary to mention thoſe kindneſſes as a favour which you conferred for your own gratification.</p>
            <p>I beg leave, nevertheleſs, to be excuſed if I put in my claim for a little gratification too; for, as nothing ever gave me more pleaſure than this proper addreſs—the ſpirit of which, I beg leave to aſſure you, is us pure

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>So many opinions have been hazarded, by cavillers, on the ſubject of the following ſongs, that it would be almoſt a tacit acquieſcence in the folly, ignorance, and abſurdity of ſuch opinions, were I to do myſelf and the public ſo much injuſtice as to let this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity paſs without giving them their merited no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>Were I diſpoſed to pleaſantry, I might ſay with my Iriſhman, that <q rend="inline">"the proper notice would be no notice at all:"</q>—and, indeed, were it not for the ſake of ſimple truth and common juſtice, ſuch calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators might as well paſs unregarded; for envy is as natural to dunces as hunger, and what ſhould they ſeek to ſatisfy but the cravings of their appetites?</p>
            <p>As, however, there is ſomething ſeriouſly material in attending to whatever in the ſlighteſt degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the public, I ſhall go a little into this buſineſs,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0259200901:9"/>
if it be only to ſhew how tiny and ineffectual are the yelpings of theſe literary curs, who, like true mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grels, never open but to do miſchief.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable that, throughout my whole public career, I have been nibbled at the heel by theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grels of the muſes, theſe ſlinking ſnarlers, who, the reverſe of the dogs that guarded the fane of Diana, fawn upon vice, and cheriſh every thing but virtue.</p>
            <p>When I compoſed the muſic of the Padlock, the cry was that I employed ſome Italian, for fifty pounds, to do that of which I was incapable. I ſmiled with contempt at the rumour, and the public very ſoon did me juſtice.</p>
            <p>After this I had the temerity to write for myſelf. The villany of ſuch an action was unpardonable; and it was immediately reſolved to brand me with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion as falſe as it was invidious. Here I was obliged to aſſert my claim to a public hearing; and the conſequence was, the town choſe to allow that I
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0259200901:10"/>
had as much right as any other perſon to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of a ſubject, and the feelings of a man.</p>
            <p>This terrible diſappointment to the ſnarlers awed them into a kind of ſulky growl, which has never ſince broke out but very partially; and as petulance and ſoreneſs generally interpret every thing the wrong way, and defeat their own ends, ſo the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their ſarcaſms have not been more remarkable than their folly. They have attributed my ſea ſongs to men who knew no more of nautical terms than an Engliſh ſailor does of art or hypocriſy; they have made more blunders in detecting my Iriſh ſongs than the ſongs contain themſelves; and in the inveſtigation of my hunting ſongs they have been perpetually at fault.</p>
            <p>A friend of mine, one evening, dropt in at a coffee-houſe where a number of theſe literary jurymen were holding an inqueſt over my murdered reputation.—He humoured the jeſt, and, before he had finiſhed, proved, to the ſatisfaction of every one preſent, that
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0259200901:11"/>
Poor Jack was a poſthumous work of Dr. Johnſon, that the Race Horſe was written by the jockey who rode the famous Flying Childers, and that Blow high Blow low was the production of Admiral Keppel, who dictated the words to his ſecretary as he lay in his cot, after the memorable battle of the twenty-ſeventh of July, waiting for the French to try their force with him handſomely the next morning.</p>
            <p>But the miſchief of it is, theſe poor devils cannot diſcern that all they do to injure me gives me real conſequence. The public are always ſure to take up a man at whom the ſhafts of rancour are levelled.—If his efforts be nothing more than inoffenſive, he is ſecure of protection in favour of his intentions; if meritorious, they know too well their own dignity not to rank him according to his deſerts.</p>
            <p>To that public I would make a ſolemn declaration that I am the ſole author of every thing this book contains, but that they too well know the hue of truth
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0259200901:12"/>
to need an elucidation of it by any light I can place it in.</p>
            <p>As however I do not wiſh to cruſh this vermin—on the contrary, I would have them crawl and nibble, for vermin are as neceſſary in the ſyſtem of literature as in the ſyſtem of the creation—I am willing to allow that there are plenty of faults in this work.</p>
            <p>Yet, leſt ſuch reptiles ſhould extend any fang with pleaſure at theſe delicious tidings, I muſt inſiſt that I could very often have written better had it not been for muſical neceſſity, which, in ſome inſtances, precludes nerve, and, in others, requires it, when the reverſe would probably have made the poetry read better.</p>
            <p>All theſe conſiderations are very ſafe with the public at large, to whom I never can addreſs myſelf without confeſſing more incapacity of expreſſion than is attributed to me by the ſourneſs of my heart-burnt enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0259200901:13"/>
To theſe poor creatures, did I wiſh their deſerts, I ſhould be more cruel and injurious than they have it in their power to be to me.</p>

               <l>But I did it to ſee if you jealous would prove,</l>
