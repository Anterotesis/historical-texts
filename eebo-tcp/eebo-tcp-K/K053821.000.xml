            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>KNowing your Ability in Phyſick, as well as your good and great Character in Divinity, and preſuming in the inter-change of your Studies, you had ſometimes met with the Subject, I here preſent you with, I ſubmit it to your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judgment and Cenſure.</p>
            <p>When I came firſt to reſide in theſe Parts, nothing was more nois'd among the Vulgar (in caſe of any Illneſs) than the wonderful Skill ſome Men had, above others, in <hi>Water-judgment,</hi> by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:0206400400:3"/>
            <p>This put me upon the moſt diligent Search I cou'd make, and having conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many Books on that Subject, I found no great Satisfaction in the matter; yet ſometime after, peruſing a ſmall Treatiſe, intitul'd <hi>Tractatus Epiſtolaris de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinis,</hi> &amp;c. (which proving <hi>multum in parvo,</hi> more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, tho' brief, than any I had yet read) I forthwith Tranſlated it, and having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome Collections from other Authors, I ſubjovn'd ſome late Obſervations in my own Practiſe, all which was deſign'd, for my own proper uſe only: but hearing very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, of the many grand Impoſitions, on a better ſort of People, than the meer Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, by ſome bold Quacking <hi>Medicaſters,</hi> I reſolv'd to Print the following Diſcourſe, hoping thereby, that paſſing through many Hands, it might, in ſome meaſure, prevent the too much abus'd Credulity of ſome.</p>
            <p>For indeed, too too many have been ſo long impos'd upon, that their Faith of the matter is grown ſo great, that they believe thoſe bold Pretenders, by the bare inſpection of a little <hi>Piſs,</hi> through a Glaſs, (Conjurer like) can diſcover the greateſt Secrets in Nature, and unfold the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:0206400400:4"/>difficult and moſt intricate Caſes of all Diſeaſes; Nay, I ſuppoſe, by a bare ſhake of the Urinal, they can, as well fore-tell, what number of Corns a Man has on his Toes, or what number of Teeth, an Old Woman has in her Head.</p>
            <p>Yet, I muſt confeſs indeed, ſome gueſs pretty well at the matter; for, 'tis not long ſince a good Woman in out Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood, carry'd her Daughter to a fam'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal-Conquaſſator,</hi> for his advice; who after a demure View of the Virgin-like Water, and a little handling of the tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Damſel, told the poor Woman, her Daughter was Liver-grown, that her Liver was doubled, (had two Livers) which was too true indeed; for, the poor Wench was big with Child, and viſible to almoſt every Eye, but the fond doting Mother's. How great a Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the poor Woman was in, at ſo monſtrous a Relation, I will not here, trouble you with, to recite.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now add no more, but that I may pre-ſuppoſe, that this Piſ-pot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will not ſavour well, in the Noſtrils
<pb facs="tcp:0206400400:5"/>of every buſie Critick; but whether it will, or will not, it's equal to me, if you pleaſe favourably to accept and approve of it, which will further ingage my Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Ancients in the very Infancy of Phyſick made ſtrict Enquiries into the Nature of <hi>Urines,</hi> fetching thence their practical directions; for hence 'twas the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally took the meaſures of his Fore-knowledge and Precepts, in paſſing Judgment on the Sick, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the fitteſt ſeaſons for Phyſick. So that 'twas unlawful not to obſerve that famous, ancient and eſtabliſh'd Maxim among Phyſicians, <hi>viz. to purge Concocteds, without a right conſultation of the Chamber-pot.</hi> And this indeed ſeems moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the moſt common reaſon, that ſince we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not throughly re-ſearch the inmoſt Retirement of a Sick Body, (which is like a Veſſel cloſe ſhut up,) we ſhould take the hints of Judging from the ingeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Liquor, which in its paſſage waſhes over every part, drawing from moſt a Tincture, and carrying off ſome looſe Particles with it. For <hi>Urines</hi> are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Indications of the Conſtitutions and Ill-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments of our Bodies, (when a right Judgment is made) as Waters betray the nature of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, through which they paſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Contemplation of this, tho' the baſeſt Excrement, is become the Subject of a Science, and hath exercis'd the Wits of the moſt Renowned
<pb facs="tcp:0206400400:7"/>Phyſicians, both Ancient and Modern; concerning which are many Books extant, compil'd with the greateſt diligence, in which are enumerated the various differences of <hi>Urines,</hi> of their Colours and diverſities of conſiſtence. The Contents are exactly deſcrib'd, and for every of theſe, diſtinct Precepts of Water judgment are deliver'd, which by ſome are thought ſo certain, as if the bare Inſpection of <hi>Urine,</hi> gave intimation of every Diſeaſe or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Part, nay every minute Accident concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sick. But in this the Vulgar are moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiouſly cheated, and yet are obſtinately wilful to be impos'd upon. For they maintain, none can diſcover the Diſeaſe, nor fore-tell any thing of it, except be conſult the Chamber-pot; and unleſs the Doctor undertakes to Divine by his Urinal, (as 'twere by a Magick Glaſs) they value him not a ruſh. But for what in truth concerns the Precepts and Rules upon which the practice of Water-inſpection is bottom'd, there are many things found out by diligent Obſervation, and then confirm'd by ſound judgment. Yet becauſe the intimation of <hi>Urine</hi> is too largely ſtretch'd by ſome to particular Caſes, very many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainties interwoven, and ſome thing's plainly falſe, beſides what are liable to errour; whoſoever therefore, by this Water guide only, confidently deſcants on the Diſeaſes of the Sick, deſereves the name rather of a <hi>Juggler,</hi> than a fair Practitioner. But this Doctrine of <hi>Urines</hi> is every where ſo full of errors; becauſe its Practical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are ill made, or not well Methodiz'd. It may be juſtly ſuſpected, that the Obſervations are not rightly made, ſince from one or other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſe, a general Rule is drawn.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:0206400400:8"/>
            <p>For example: Becauſe ſome <hi>Dropſical</hi> Perſons make a thin Watery-<hi>Urine</hi> therefore 'tis Canon'd, that ſuch <hi>Urines</hi> are the undoubted Symptoms of a <hi>Dropſy;</hi> when indeed, in ſome other Affects, the ſame kind of <hi>Urine</hi> is made: And ſometimes in <hi>Dropſies</hi> the <hi>Urine</hi> is thick and of a deep Red.</p>
            <p>Again, what is vulgarly moſt receiv'd, is for the moſt part uncertain, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Urine</hi> upon which there ſwims a Scum (like that on Water wherein <hi>Tartar</hi> has been boyl'd doth ſignifie a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> when this ſign is more proper and familiar to <hi>Hypochondriacks,</hi> than <hi>Conſumptive</hi> Perſons, and alſo very many, without this ſign, die of a <hi>Conſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, what is generally affirm'd is altogether falſe, that the nature of any Affect is diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by <hi>Urines;</hi> becauſe, ſometimes thoſe that are diſeaſed make water like ſound Men: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe who ſeem to be ſufficiently in health, by reaſon of ſome accident (perhaps the Food they have eaten) make ſuſpicious <hi>Urine,</hi> and ſuch as are eſtranged from a natural ſtate. As to the Method or Doctrine of <hi>Urines</hi> deliver'd by moſt, it looks altogether Empirick-like, and not at all rational. For the naked differences of <hi>Urines</hi> are recited, as they are uſually diſtinguiſht in their Colour, Conſiſtence and Contents: Then to every of theſe kinds are oppos'd Pathological, <hi>i. e.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deſcribing ſignifications, only collected from more unuſual Obſervations; when in the interim neither the Cauſes of <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> or preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural alterations (as ought to have been) are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, neither is the intimation of <hi>Urines</hi> apply'd
<pb facs="tcp:0206400400:9"/>to the Cauſes of Diſeaſes, but only to the Diſeaſe or its Symptom.</p>
            <p>Therefore 'tis very often deceitful and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by reaſon the Morbifick Cauſe and Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame <hi>Urine,</hi> may indifferently at the ſame time, point at divers Diſeaſes and Symptoms medimely.</p>
            <p>For Example: Thin and watriſh-<hi>Urine</hi> very often unmediately ſignifies want of Concoction in the Bowels: Yet by reaſon of the ſtate of Crudity, oftentimes the <hi>Green-ſickneſs</hi> in Virgins, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Dropſy,</hi> or white and Phlegmatick Swelling of the whole Body, ſometimes the <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach</hi> and many other Affects alſo ariſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>URINE</hi> new made, or after putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by long digeſtion, may be Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally reſolv'd into theſe Principles. By Diſtillation, 1ſt, A ſmall Spirit, like that of Wine diluted with Water, aſcends; but in ſo little a quantity, that 'tis not eaſily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: This is ſucceeded by a watery Liquor conſiderable in quantity, intermix'd with ſome looſer particles of <hi>Salt,</hi> and principally <hi>Sulphur:</hi> 3dly, A very penetrative Water is exhal'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Spiritus Urinae,</hi> which has but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Wine-like Spirit, being generally only a Phlegm very much ſharpen'd with <hi>Salt;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in Vinegar diſtill'd, it aſcends laſt.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Urine</hi> is volatile, and of Vinegar fluid, therefore the diſtill'd Liquor impregnated with the particles of this, is very Acid; but what's incorporated with the ſaline particles of the other, is very ſharp and pungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>'Tis hence evident, That the <hi>Spiritus Urine</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0206400400:13"/>(commonly ſo call'd) owes its ſharpneſs eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Salt;</hi> becauſe tho' moſt ſubtile, it takes not flame; but extinguiſheth it, if preſented to it.</p>
               <p>After Diſtillation, and the remaining moiſture being wholly evaporated, another portion of <hi>Salt</hi> with a little Earth remains in the bottom of the Matraſs, out of which by a ſtronger heat, a <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> may be ſublim'd, leaving the earthy Dregs behind.</p>
               <p>This Anatomy of <hi>Urine,</hi> plainly ſhews, That the Principles whereof it conſiſts, are moſt <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> a little <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and very little <hi>Spirit.</hi> We may diſcern the Saltneſs of <hi>Urines</hi> by Taſte and Touch; in Taſte it comes neareſt a Nitrous Salt, and proceeds from the ſalt Particles of what we eat, which by Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Veſſels, is for the moſt part elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into a Volatile Salt, <hi>i. e.</hi> a <hi>Salt</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spirit, which by their long and mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination are knit together in the cloſeſt tye: hence Salt it ſelf otherwiſe fix'd, is volatiliz'd, and (as 'twere by the Wing of another) becomes not unfit for motion.</p>
               <p>From the different Diſpoſitions of our Bodies, <hi>Urines</hi> contain more or leſs <hi>Salt,</hi> and that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Accidents) more volatile or fix'd, and therefore are different in Colour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
               <p>That there's <hi>Sulphur</hi> in <hi>Urines,</hi> their ſpeedy putrefaction and ſtink ſufficiently prove; and it proceeds from the ſaline-ſulphureous Particles of Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Of this Sulphur there's leſs than in Blood, the Horns of Animals, or Soot; (and therefore in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0206400400:14"/>Diſtillation of <hi>Urine,</hi> nothing almoſt Oily or Fat aſcends) for while the Blood circulates, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous and ſulphureous Bodies which depart from it, for the moſt part evaporate: In the interim, the ſaline and watery reliques make up the <hi>Urine.</hi> Yet <hi>Urines</hi> always have ſome <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities and proportion are diverſly altered, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different degrees of Concoction and Crudity; hence proceed the changes of heat and conſiſtence in <hi>Urines.</hi> That the wine-like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Urine</hi> are but few, 'tis evident from the defect in the Liquor firſt Diſtill'd, as alſo from the ſudden putrefaction of <hi>Urine;</hi> but the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine motion of the Particles in <hi>Urine,</hi> conclude ſome; <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeparation of Thin from Thick, and the ſpontaneous diviſion of ſome parts from others, and the collection of that <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> or thick ſubſtance which generally ſubſides, at the bottom of <hi>Urine;</hi> beſides, the ſaline Particles (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they become volatile) are cloſely wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the ſpirituous, and therefore become more brisk in motion and quick of energy. Yet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different plenty and prevalency of Spirits in <hi>Urines,</hi> there are divers modes of thoſe <hi>Nubeculae,</hi> or Urine-clouds, and alſo of the Sediments, and the <hi>Urines</hi> themſelves, have a more quick or ſlow putrefaction. The watry-part in <hi>Urine,</hi> far exceeds the reſt in quantity, as being almoſt ſix times more than the other: And by Diſtillation 'tis not ſo clearly ſeparated, but that ſome vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> aſcend together with it, which tincture it with an ingrateful ſent.</p>
               <p>This has its original from a plentiful ingeſtion of Liquids with Food, which yet of what kind
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0206400400:15"/>ſoever they be, loſe their proper Qualities, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire others, before their change into <hi>Urine;</hi> for nothing almoſt ſincere of that Liquor we drink, beſides moiſture, barely remains in the Piſs.</p>
               <p>The diſtillation and evaporation of <hi>Urine,</hi> plainly demonſtrate, that there's ſome portion of Earth, as well as ſlimy-muddy Dreggs in it; for when all the liquid parts are exhal'd, the Earth, as a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> remains in the bottom in a moderate quantity.</p>
               <p>For in the Nutritive Juice, beſides the active Principles of <hi>Salt, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> is requir'd ſomething ſolid, whence Bodies have their bulk and magnitude. The Recrements and earthy Dreggs of this, are plentifully diſſolv'd in the ſerous part, making the contents of a more thick conſiſtence; but this is different according to the variable State of Concoction and Crudity.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Principles which make up the Body of <hi>Urine,</hi> into which, by Chymiſtry 'tis eaſily reſolvable.</p>
               <p>From the combinations and various admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of theſe, the other Accidents of <hi>Urine, viz.</hi> Quantity, Colour and Conſiſtence, which are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the moſt obſervable in it, and from hence the eſpecial Objects of Urine-judgment, do ariſe; for when almoſt nothing beſides is diſcernible in <hi>Urine,</hi> thoſe make the firſt <hi>Phaenomenons,</hi> in the right ſolution of which, the whole Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of this Science conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in the next place, I ſhall Treat of theſe; and firſt, concerning the <hi>Urines</hi> of ſound Men, what is their Quantity, Colour, Conſiſtence and Contents; as alſo I ſhall endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0206400400:16"/>upon what mixture of Elements, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Bowels and Veſſels, every one of theſe depend,</p>
               <p>In the next place it ſhall be ſhew'd, how far the <hi>Urines</hi> of ſick Perſons, differ from the Rule and Standard of thoſe who are ſound. And I ſhall endeavour to aſſign the proper Cauſes of their change to each of theſe Differences; and what I have ſaid hitherto, ſhall finiſh the firſt ſcope of my Diſcourſe, to wit, the Anatomy of <hi>Urine.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning the Quantity and Colour in Sound Mens <hi>Urine.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE quantity of <hi>Urine</hi> in Sound Men, ought to be a little leſs, than the Liquids dayly ingeſted; for what is potable and moiſt that is daily taken, is the very matter of which <hi>Urines</hi> primarily conſiſt. But theſe (when hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt urge) are more plentifully requir'd, that they may ſufficiently dilute the Maſs of <hi>Chyle,</hi> for its right Fermentation in the Bowels; as alſo that it may ſerve for a Vehicle, both to convey it into the Maſs of Blood, that the Blood it ſelf may circulate in the Veſſels without Stagnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the Nervous Juice, that it may actuate and moiſten the Organs of ſenſe and motion. Thus the ſerous part having almoſt contributed whatever <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Sulphur</hi> it had, gives place to a new Nutritive Humor, and it ſelf then, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0206400400:17"/>unprofitable, is carry'd off from the Blood, by the ſecluſive help of the <hi>Kidneys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nouriſhing Liquor, which at laſt is chang'd unto <hi>Urine,</hi> is different in its own nature; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wateriſh, ſometimes inpregnated with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſometimes with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different prevalency of this or that Element in it, many Variations happen: but no liquids wholly and unchanged paſs our Bodies, but in diverſe parts, undergo their mutations and looſe ſome portion of their quantities, before they be ultimated into Piſs. For the Liquor to be turn'd into <hi>Urine,</hi> being firſt receiv'd into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and ſtaying there till Concocted, is alſo Impregnated with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> of its own or other diſſolv'd particles, from ſome more ſolid nouriſhment; after this, much of it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Nutritive Juice is mixt with the Blood, with which after long Circulation, and then according to the various temper of the Blood, and its accenſion in the Heart, it receives a further tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur;</hi> hence ſome portion of it, is deriv'd into the Brain and Nerves, and there being render'd weak and non-Nutritive 'tis final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again reduc'd into the maſs of Blood. After that, the more generous part of the <hi>Serum</hi> is ſpent upon the Blood and the Nervous juice, a great part alſo by Sweat and other Emunctories, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, while the Blood continually paſſeth the Reins, is there ſeparated from it, either by Percolation, or the Force of ſome Fermentation, by way of precipitation, paſſing the Ureters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bladder, whence 'tis ejected.</p>
               <p>From the Original and view of this ſerous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0206400400:18"/>part now diſcrib'd, 'tis evident and that clearly, that the <hi>Urine</hi> ought to anſwer the quantity of Liquids ingeſted in a proportion ſomewhat leſs, perhaps about a third, which plainly ſhews the complextion and ſtrength of the Bowels, whoſe Office is Concoction, and likewiſe of the Blood it ſelf, as alſo in ſome ſort, the temper and diſtribution of the <hi>Succus Nervoſus:</hi> Moreover it carries with it the ſigns of the affects of the urinary Paſſages.</p>
               <p>The quantity of the Urine does not always hit this Rule, but ſometimes exceeds, ſometimes comes ſhort, and for a little time, may conſiſt with a State, not much out of tune; but the long continuance of ſuch different Accidents argues a ſickly condition: Concerning theſe, I ſhall ſpeak amongſt the <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> of <hi>Urine</hi> in a craſy Body.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I conſider the Colour of a ſound <hi>Urine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Urine</hi> that is made, after a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in the whole Body, is of a Citron-colour like a <hi>Lixivium</hi> indifferently boil'd, which without doubt proceeds from the Salt and Sulphur of the Nutritive Juice and Blood, diſſolv'd by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition in the <hi>Serum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Colour ariſes not from <hi>Salt</hi> only, (as ſome contend) for any Liquor that is impregnated with Salt (except it be evaporated to a certain thik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) doth not at all grow Yellow: And truly the Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> diſſolv'd by liquation, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains clear.</p>
               <p>To what's objected concerning a <hi>lixivium</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; I anſwer, the whole quantity of <hi>Sulphur</hi> is not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0206400400:19"/>ſpent by burning, but the citron colour ariſes from ſome Salt and other aduſt Sulphureous particles cleaving to the aſhes, infus'd and incocted in the Liquor. Nor has ſound <hi>Urine</hi> this tincture from <hi>Sulphur</hi> only; for Sulphur in a Wateriſh <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> cannot be diſſolv'd without the addition of <hi>Salt;</hi> neither parts with any of its tincture without ſuch addition: and therefore if you digeſt Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> and common <hi>Sulphur</hi> together in Water, or boil Antimony in a Salt <hi>Menſtrum,</hi> both liquors, Urine like, grow Yellow from thence; even ſo the Salt and Sulphureous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Nouriſhment, by digeſtion in the Stomach and Inteſtines, and by circulation with the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, being minutely divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and througly incocted with the <hi>Serum,</hi> make the <hi>Urine</hi> of a Citron-colour.</p>
               <p>The diſſolution of Salt and Sulphur in manner aforemention'd, by which <hi>Urines</hi> become Citron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd, is firſt begun in the Bowels, afterwards perfected in the other Veſſels, much depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Concoction of the Stomach and Inteſtines.</p>
               <p>For here by the help of Heat, and Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Nouriſhments ingeſted are eſpecially fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. The tye of mixture being looſed, the Sulphureous and Saline particles minutely brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, are advanc'd into <hi>Chyle,</hi> and then the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> which is the remainder from the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſtribution of that Milkie Juice, becomes citron colour'd; as when Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Sulphur</hi> are diſſolv'd together in any Liquor, and ſome <hi>Acid</hi> pour'd upon it, it preſently turns milkie, and ſoon after, the contents being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated <hi>per Sabſidentiam,</hi> the remainder of the Liquor grows yellow like a <hi>Lixivium.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0206400400:20"/>
               <p>But if the Nouriſhment, through ſome indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Stomach, be not rightly digeſted in the firſt Concoction, as it often happens in a <hi>Pica, Dropſie,</hi> and other Diſtemperatures of the Bowels, the <hi>Urine</hi> then becomes crude, clear and almoſt inſipid like Fountain Water.</p>
               <p>But by reaſon of the too exalted, or otherwiſe deprav'd Ferments of the Bowels; as in the <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Hypocondriack Melancholy,</hi> or in a <hi>Feaveriſh</hi> conſtitution, the particles of nouriſhment being too much diſſolv'd in the firſt Region, the <hi>Urines</hi> become red and thick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Serum,</hi> which in the firſt Concoction, as is ſaid, had got a tincture like <hi>Lie,</hi> being mixt with the Blood, as long as it circulates with it, is yet further concocted and gets a deeper colour; for tho' the throughly concocted particles of Blood are generally ſeparated into the <hi>Veſicula fellis,</hi> yet partly their incoction in the <hi>Serum</hi> enhances 'its tincture. Hence <hi>Urine</hi> firſt made after Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is moſt pale; the next made ſomewhat red; and after long faſting, yet more deep.</p>
               <p>Where the Blood is more cold, as in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexia,</hi> the colour of <hi>Urine</hi> is below its juſt ſtate; but where the Blood is accended and as 'twere boil'd by a Feaveriſh Heat, 'tis of a high Red.</p>
               <p>'Tis worthy obſervation, that ſome <hi>Urines,</hi> and thoſe ſound, made after large drinking, are not colour'd, but pale and wateriſh.</p>
               <p>Concerning which, the enquiry is, how the <hi>Serum</hi> ſo ſuddenly paſſes the Stomach, (contrary to common belief) and running through firſt the Chylie-paſſages, then the Veins, Arteries, the Ventricles of the Heart, the turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0206400400:21"/>of the Reins and Ureters, in ſo ſhort a ſpace is ſent out of the Body; and beſides, otherwiſe than in moſt other caſes, borrows no colour in its paſſages, but loſes its own.</p>
               <p>'Tis probable, beſides the long circuit of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive juice, wherein after ſome ſtay in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it glides down the Inteſtines, and thence is carry'd through the <hi>lacteal</hi>-Veſſels into new paſſages, and thence into the Veins; (a circuit not to be run in a trice, therefore) 'tis probable, I ſay, that there's another more proper paſſage of the ſame Nutritive Juice, by which 'tis preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey'd to the Maſs of Blood and perhaps to the <hi>Succus Nervoſus.</hi> Wherefore after long hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, immediately upon Eating, but eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Drinking, we find a ſudden refreſhment, which cannot be ſuppos'd to proceed but from Spirits or Vapours; becauſe immediately after ſuch drinking follows piſſing, and that ſooner than the Maſs of Chyle can be thought to be ſent out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Therefore it ſeems not improbable, that forthwith a thinner part of the Nouriſhing Liquor (that's receiv'd into the Stomach) conſiſting of ſome Spirit and eſpeially Water, is imbib'd by its Membranes, like a Spunge, and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd into the Mouths of the Veins, and is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixt with the Blood in its return to the Heart. For many are of this opinion, that the Chyle in ſome meaſure is immediately deriv'd from the Stomach and Inteſtines, through the branches of the <hi>Vena porta</hi> into the Maſs of Blood. And as the lacteal paſſages carry it about in a long Circuit, by which 'tis ſent into the deſcending Branch of the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> ſo by a nearer way,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0206400400:22"/>through theſe Veſſels, may it be carry'd into the aſcending branch of the ſame Vein; for the Blood, being in ſome meaſure impoveriſht with its Circulation, returning both ways, ought to be refreſhed with a new Juice, before it enters the Heart, to enliven the Ferment there.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the far greater part of Blood is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd upward, it ſeems certainly Reaſonable, that ſome part of the Nutritive Juice ſhould as 'twere fewel for a new accenſion in the Heart) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the Blood already ſpent and grown feeble. Many arguments make for this, which to recite, were too large a digreſſion from my preſent ſcope; wherefore I think 'tis in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure after the manner aforeſaid, that we piſs ſuch a pale wateriſh <hi>Urine,</hi> ſo ſoon after drinking.</p>
               <p>That Liquor, which from Nouriſhment is ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily convey'd into the Maſs of Blood, not paſſing through ſo many windings, as the membranes of the Bowells, (as if drawn by diſtillation, the groſſer part rejected) in a manner, is only Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Spirit, whereby it may refreſh the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits and dilute the Blood. In which task, the ſpirituous part being ſpent, the wateriſh part, being weighty and troubleſome by reaſon of its plenty, is continually ſent out by the Kidneys; and ſince it comes from the Stomach, not as yet embrewed with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> nor is not ſo long circulated with the blood, as to acquire from thence, a lixivious tincture, tis piſs'd out thin and clear.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Concerning the Conſiſtence and Contents of the <hi>Urine</hi> of the ſound.</head>
               <p>HItherto have we diſcours'd of the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and Colour of <hi>Urines</hi> in ſound Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but as to the Contents, there ought to be nothing in ſound <hi>Urines,</hi> beſides the <hi>Nubecula</hi> or <hi>Urine</hi>-ſloud; and what this is, and how it is form'd, in the next place remains to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd.</p>
               <p>While the maſs of Blood is commixt with <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> and the Nutritive humour, 'tis continually circulated in the Veſſels; from hence a certain Nutritive Juice, by perpetual digeſtion is elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, which becomes a Nutriment at laſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſupplying the ſolid Parts. This at firſt is concocted into a glutinous Humour, not much unlike the white of an Egg; after that, into ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Filaments, which being interwoven in the pores and little ſpaces of the ſolid Parts, ſupply them with an augmentation always of new Subſtance. And while the <hi>Serum,</hi> that is mixt with the Blood, waſhes over all the regions of the Body, it ſwallows up in it ſelf a ſuperfluous part of this laſt Nouriſhment, deſign'd for the Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſolid Parts, and carries out with it, that which makes the <hi>Urine</hi>-cloud. When this appears (becauſe it ſignifies Concoction and Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition in ſome meaſure) 'tis accounted a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign; but if no ſuch <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> be viſible,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0206400400:24"/>'tis a ſign of Crudity, as in a <hi>Cachexia</hi> and Dyſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in <hi>Feavers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It conſiſts of ſlender Filaments (as aforeſaid) and is diſperſt thro' the whole body of the <hi>Urine,</hi> and then is gather'd together into one Cloud, Thus; the Filaments are long and ſomewhat ſmooth, having ſome aſperities, bramble-like, ſo that being mov'd to and fro, they eaſily take hold one of another, and are complicated in themſelves; as if we ſhou'd caſt many Hairs into a Veſſel full of Water, and there by often ſhaking, and toſſing the Veſſel about, the Hairs, which at firſt Swim on the top, here and there, ſhortly after Mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace, and knit in one knot. After the ſame manner, ('tis probable) the Filaments which make up the <hi>Nubecula</hi> or Urine-cloud, being toſt too and fro by the innate heat and Spirits of the <hi>Urine,</hi> do concur and knit together, till by a mutual complex of each other they Concenter into one little Cloud; and becauſe thoſe Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are more compact and firm, than the reſt of the Contents of the Urine, by reaſon of their Gravity, they fall to the bottom. 'Tis highly probable, that ſuch Filaments, in ſome Perſons make up the Urine-cloud; becauſe the Blood in a good State, and conſequently diſpoſed for Nouriſhment, is interwoven with many Fibres or white threads, which any body may diſcover by phlebotomy, when the Blood is receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hot Water; therefore 'tis probable that ſome divided ſlender parts of thoſe threads, being ſnatch'd along with the <hi>Serum,</hi> are the matter of that Wool-like Subſidence in the Urine: Wherefore in a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> the blood being water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0206400400:25"/>through Crudities, and unfit for Nouriſhment, is diſtitute of thoſe Elaborated ſmall fibrous threads; as likewiſe in great Dyſcraſies, when by an over ebullition of the Blood, the Nutritive Juice is not rightly concocted into ſuch like threads, the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or thick Sediment of the <hi>Urine</hi> is either utterly wanting, or very much confus'd and troubled.</p>
               <p>A good and laudable Urine-cloud is white, round and equal, falling towards the bottom; and to this is requir'd, firſt, that the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be rightly elaborated, whereby the Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may become ſomewhat ſmooth, round and firm, like ſlender threads.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> That the <hi>Urine</hi> be ſufficiently Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Spirits, which (as 'tis evident in the Fermentation of new Wine) may drive and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate the parts to and fro.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> That the Liquor be not too thick, nor its pores prepoſſeſs'd with other little bodies, whereby it may happen, that the motion of the Contents may be hindred; wherefore there ought to be an ample ſpace left, to agitate and hurry about ſuch Particles. If the Urine-cloud be red, 'tis a Sign that the laſt nouriſhment is render'd aduſt, and over concocted by too much Heat; therefore ſuch a Sediment for the moſt part, is in the beginning of <hi>Feavers,</hi> while the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Bowells and Veſſels is not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preverted. If the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> be broken and unequal, 'tis a ſign, that the Nutriment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the ſolid Parts, is not rightly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concocted, that its particles are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Congenerous, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the ſame kind, and of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0206400400:26"/>the ſame Nature, and therefore the Filaments hang not together Uniformly, but as 'twere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Separate and confus'd manner of Implicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; hence ſome that are more craſs, fall to the bottom; others more rare, hang higher. When the ſubſtance, of which the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> is made, doth not altogether fall, but wholly hangs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the top or middle Region, it happens thus, either becauſe 'tis made of Filaments not perfectly Elaborated, firm and compact, but more thin and Spungy, or becauſe the Liquor is more than ordinary Impregnated with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and therefore like a ſtrong <hi>Lixivium,</hi> bears up that weighty matter, which otherwiſe wou'd fall to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Some times the <hi>Nubecula</hi> or Urine-cloud is wholly wanting in ſound Bodies, after long Hunger, immoderate Labours or extraordinary Sweats, the matter being either wholly ſpent in Nutriment; or evaporated by Sweat: And.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Feavers,</hi> becauſe the mixture of the Blood is greatly Deprav'd: in the longing and deprav'd Appetites of Child bearing Women; in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexia</hi> or an ill habit of body, and other ſuch like Affects, by reaſon of the Predominant Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Conſiſtence of ſound <hi>Urines,</hi> not many things worthy obſervation occur. 'Tis commonly like Middle Ale well purify'd by Fermentation, or a <hi>Lixivium</hi> indifferently boil'd: <hi>viz.</hi> The aqueous part of the <hi>Urine,</hi> ought to contain within its pores and ſpaces many particles of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> broke and diſolv'd very ſmall, as alſo a little Earth disjoin'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0206400400:27"/>into the leaſt atomes, and diſperſt throughout the whole body of the <hi>Urine.</hi> If the Conſiſtence be thinner, than it ought to be, as 'tis ſeen in clear and wateriſh. <hi>Urine,</hi> 'tis a Sign of Indigeſtion and Crudity, that the aliment is not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted: but if the <hi>Urine</hi> be more craſs and thick than it ought to be, 'tis a Sign the body of the Liquor is clogg'd with Preternatural Contents; but of theſe elſewhere, when we treat of the <hi>Urines</hi> of ſick Perſons. Hitherto have we ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of <hi>Urine</hi> in a ſound Body, both as the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sign of Concoction rightly perform'd in the Bowells and other Veſſels.</p>
               <p>We muſt take the meaſures of its Quantity from what we drink; its Citron-colour, from <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> diſſolv'd and incocted in the <hi>Serum.</hi> The <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or Contents depend upon the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments elaborated in the maſs of Blood, for the nouriſhment of the ſolid parts. Its Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is from <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> together with ſome particles of Earth, filling up the pores and ſpaces of the ſerous Part. It remains next, that we treat of the <hi>Urines</hi> of ſick Perſons, in which likewiſe the Quantity, Colour, Contents and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, as alſo ſome other accidents, offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our conſideration.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Of the Quantity and Colour of the <hi>Urines</hi> of Sick Perſons.</head>
               <p>IN a deſeaſe or ſickly State of Body, the Quan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Urine</hi> frequently anſwers not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0206400400:28"/>proportion of ingeſted Liquids; for ſometimes there's a Defect, (ſometimes an Exceſſ) in the juſt Meaſure, when the <hi>Urine</hi> is far leſs than the ingeſted Liquors. The reaſon of the Defect is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſerous part Stagnates ſomewhere in the Body, or is diverted ſome other way, than that of the <hi>Urinary</hi> excretion; For 'tis either <hi>1ſt,</hi> lodg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the Bowels and their cavities, and ſometimes alſo ſtays longer, than it ought, in the Stomach, by which means 'tis ſomewhat diſtended, cauſing troubleſome Spitting: but more frequently it is lodg'd in the hollow of the Paunch, ſometimes in the cavity of the Breaſt or Head, and there uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produces <hi>Dropſical</hi> Diſeaſes: or <hi>2dly.</hi> the <hi>ſerum</hi> Stagnates in the Veſſels, and thereby augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Maſs of Blood and Nervous Liquor, greatly perverts their motion: or <hi>3dly.</hi> that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh Humour is thrown upon the habit of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſo creates a ſwelling of the whole or ſome parts: or <hi>4thly</hi> and laſtly 'tis obſtructed in the <hi>Urinary</hi> paſſages, by a Stone or ſome Viſcous matter creating Pain and Convulſions in thoſe parts, and a Superfluity of <hi>ſerum</hi> in the whole Body.</p>
               <p>But when the <hi>ſerum</hi> is diverted otherways, it often diſpoſes the Sick to frequent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sweats, or almoſt a continual Flux. The Affects therefore which the deficient Quantity of <hi>Urine</hi> indicates, are Swellings and aqueous colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſome Bowels, alſo ſometimes Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Pains, ſometimes an ill Diſpoſition of the <hi>genus nervoſum,</hi> ſometimes an univerſal <hi>Dropſy</hi> and <hi>phlegmatick</hi> Tumours, and ſometimes the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0206400400:29"/>Stone in the Reins and Bladder; ſometimes alſo the penury of <hi>Urine</hi> is the effect and ſign of ſome other praeternatural Evacuation, to wit, of Sweat, a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> or ſome other immoderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. To deſcribe every cauſe and mode of the office of the <hi>Serum,</hi> either as it is in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or as it is excern'd thence, were in a manner to bring over hither, the whole matter of all the Affects; for many and diverſe are the Occaſions and Circumſtances, by reaſon of which the <hi>ſerum</hi> is lodg'd in this or that Part, and by ſtaying in the Body, leſſens the quantity of <hi>Urine.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the principal and moſt frequent cauſe of this, is not ſo much the Vice of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen or Reins, as that of the Blood it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Free and plentiful Piſſing, as likewiſe its tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in the Body and penurious Excretion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend eſpecially upon the temper of the Blood and its Accenſion or Fermentation in the Heart: For, if the Blood be impregnated with active principles, (<hi>viz. Spirit, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi>) rightly exalted, and have a lively Ferment in the Veſſels, ſo that the well looſened complex of the Liquor be rightly accended by the Ferment of the Heart, it all in a manner Spiritualizeth, and by its Heat and rapid Motion Tranſmits it ſelf, without obſtruction, through every Part; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is ſuperfluous and volatile evaporates, and while the Blood that is rarify'd and as 'twere boyling with Heat, paſſeth the Reins, that which is the ſerous part, either by reaſon only, the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, is as 'twere its Strainer, or having in them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0206400400:30"/>ſome Coagulated matter, is eaſily ſeparated and as 'twere Precipitated from the reſt of the Maſs of Blood. Tis the ſame in a manner with the Maſs of Blood, what we obſerve in Milke; <hi>viz.</hi> while it grows Hot and almoſt Boyling, it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily Curds or Coagulates, and its <hi>Serum</hi> or Whey ſoon ſeparates by pouring in a little Runnet or any ſharp ſour Liquor; but if it be Cold, though you pour in ſtronger Ferments and a conſiderable quantity of any Acid, ſcarce any Precipitation follows.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the Blood become more Cold and Watery from an ill constitution of Diet, ſo that being leſs impregnated with active Particles, its Ebullition is more ſlow, 'tis accended as 'twere piece-meal in the Heart, and circulates very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with difficulty in the Veſſels, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the courſe of the pores and paſſages in the Fleſh and Bowels, ſticks by degrees, leaving ſomething of it ſelf behind it: whence Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tumours every where accrue.</p>
               <p>By this means alſo, the Blood being Feeble and Viſcous, is conſequently leſs ſit for Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Percolation, and doth not ſo readily convey its ſerous Excrements into the Kidneys, but leaves them every where diſpers'd in the whole Body, by reaſon of the Settlement of ſome Humour and Difficulty of Circulation. Wherefore in this State, thoſe things which much exagitate the Blood, as Exerciſe, ſwift and frequent Motion; or as thoſe things which like Rennet infus'd do precipitate, as Acids and Salt Preparations do, provoke <hi>Urine</hi> more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0206400400:31"/>
               <p>Sometimes ſick Perſons Piſs very copiouſly, ſo that in the ſpace of twenty four hours, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate twice or thrice as much <hi>Urine</hi> as they have taken Liquids. The cauſe of which Effect is divers, and the Signification much different. If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diminution' of its quantity, or ſuppreſſion of <hi>Urine;</hi> if in <hi>dropſical</hi> affects, <hi>Rheumatiſms</hi> or other nervous Paſſions, or the <hi>criſis</hi> of <hi>Feavers,</hi> plenty of <hi>Urine</hi> naturally, or by the uſe of <hi>Diureticks,</hi> freely enſue, for the moſt part it preſages the diſcontinuance of the Diſeaſe and Preternatural Indiſpoſition; or at leaſt, its declenſion. But if (as I have often obſerv'd, without theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going and premention'd effects) the <hi>Urine</hi> far exceeds the ingeſted Liquids, and thence enſue a remarkable Debility, this indeed portends an ill State, an inclination to an <hi>Atrophy</hi> or Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have known ſome Women of a ſlender thin habit of Body, who ſometimes being indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd for many days together, were wont to make in great plenty (above what Liquids they took) a thin Watery <hi>Urine,</hi> without Contents or <hi>Urine</hi>-cloud, at which time, they complain'd of their ſtrength languiſhing, difficulty of Breathing, and an inability to Motion.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe in this caſe, the Blood and <hi>Succus Nervoſus,</hi> by an exalted and fluid <hi>Salt,</hi> became too acid, and conſequently unapt to be in the leaſt diſſolv'd in their mixture, and were too much diſpos'd to Seroſities; for 'tis obſervable, that whatever Liquids, tho' thick and clammy, if kept till ſour, they preſently become more thinn and wateriſh. Further, 'tis manifeſt, that thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0206400400:32"/>accidental overflowings of <hi>Urine</hi> ariſe from ſuch a diſpoſition of the Blood and Humours; for the <hi>Urine</hi> has a Vinegar Smack: and ſuch affects (as aforemention'd) are ordinarily cur'd by <hi>Chalybeat</hi> Medicines, and not always by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aſtringents and Thickners.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Colour of the <hi>Urine</hi> of the Sick, that of ſound Perſons muſt be the rule and Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, by which all the reſt ought to be try'd and judg'd.</p>
               <p>Since then the Colour of theirs who are Sound, ought to be Citron; the <hi>Urine</hi> of thoſe that are ſick, will either be more Pale than Citron, and ſo white like common Water; or more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tinctur'd, and then generally 'twil be either of a Flame or Saffron-colour, Red, Green or Black. In ſhort, I'le endeavour to appropriate the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from which each of theſe Alterations proceed, and what Affects or preparations of Diſeaſes they uſually indicate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Urine</hi> is clear like Water, when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the indigeſtive faculty of the Stomach, the <hi>Saline</hi> and <hi>Sulphureous</hi> particles of our Meat are not ſo well concocted and minutely broke, that they can be volatiliz'd and diſſolv'd in the <hi>Serum</hi> to tincture it ſo deep, as that after all its windings and paſſages it can beſpeak its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
               <p>For Liquids, that are to be chang'd into <hi>Urine,</hi> by reaſon they are preſs'd and driven through ſecret and very narrow Paſſages, as 'twere by Diſtillation, thereby looſe their Colour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence which they had when ingeſted, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0206400400:33"/>nothing from the Chyle (whoſe vehicle they are) but what is volatile. Wherefore if by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of eminent Crudity, <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Contents be not firſt volatiliz'd in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, nor after, diſſolv'd in the Veſſels ſo far, as to run the ſame courſe with the <hi>Serum,</hi> this at laſt, in a manner diveſted of all, is ſent out like clear Water. And that ſuch <hi>Urines</hi> generally want their active Principles, 'tis evident, becauſe they are longeſt preſerv'd from Putrifaction.</p>
               <p>Such <hi>Urine</hi> in Virgins generally ſignifies a <hi>Chlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſis</hi> or the <hi>Green-Sickneſs,</hi> in moſt an ill habit of Body or a <hi>Dropſie;</hi> in ſome 'tis a ſign of great crudity and the want of Concoction; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo, in thoſe who are ſubject to the <hi>Stone,</hi> it Preindicates an approaching Fit, <hi>viz.</hi> while the <hi>Serum</hi> in the Kidneys is coagulated by an acid fermenting Juice, its Contents being condens'd into a Tartarous matter, a thin wateriſh part is only excern'd. They who for a time, (let the Diſeaſe be what it will) Piſs thin and wateriſh, have very often theſe Symptoms; difficult and frequent Breathing after motion, Diſtenſion about the region of the Stomach, and as 'twere a Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or Puffing up, after Meat. The reaſon of which wholly depends upon want of Volatiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Blood: For, becauſe its Liquor is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of active particles rightly exalted, <hi>viz.</hi> (<hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi>) therefore 'tis not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently accended by the ferment of the Heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole ſhould preſently ſally and as 'twere break forth into a Flame; but fermenting with difficulty, and apt to Stagnate, or for the moſt part
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0206400400:34"/>to ſettle in the Heart, 'tis much oppreſs'd by it; wherefore, if the Blood thus diſpos'd, be haſten'd thro' the Ventricles of the Heart, by a motion more quick than ordinary, becauſe it has not free Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it preſently ſallies out, in a manner all at once; therefore there is need of a greater En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and more frequent Agitation of the Lungs to pump it.</p>
               <p>Wateriſh <hi>Urines</hi> therefore, fore-tell ſuch like Crudities in the Blood; becauſe if they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in a manner, no tincture from the <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> 'tis a ſign their particles are leſs diſſolv'd, or leſs volatiliz'd, in the Maſs of Blood.</p>
               <p>As to the Diſtention of the Stomach, of which clear <hi>Urines</hi> are both an effect and ſign; I ſay, for want of a due Fermentation, the Chyle is not all changed into a volatile white Subſtance, but (like Bread not fermented) is alter'd and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into a heavy ponderous Maſs, which is ſlowly, and not without a Viſcous Phlegme ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, ſent from the Stomach, whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques being fixt to the foldings and membranes of the Stomach, obſtruct all its Pores and Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo that nothing can evaporate, and what is more Thin and Spirituous, cannot be carry'd to the Blood forthwith through ſecret Paſſages as it ought. Hence plenty of Flatulencies or Windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is engender'd; which ſpeedily ſtretches the Stomach, blowing it up beyond its proportion. And ſince thoſe dreggs, by long reſidence in the Stomach, abound with a fixt <hi>Salt,</hi> they ſometimes degenerate into an Acid, ſometimes into a Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline or other baſe Heterogeneous matter, whence
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0206400400:35"/>Violent pains in the Stomach, deprav'd Appetite, violent heat with frequent Thirſt, ſometimes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Vomitings and other very grievous Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms ariſe. Some of which, tho' they argue heat, and that in a great degree, lurke and lye hid within: yet thoſe who are thus affected for want of Concoction, often make Crude and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh <hi>Urine.</hi> We have thus now largely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of clear <hi>Urine,</hi> becauſe the reaſons of the reſt, may be had hence, which are Pale and thin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Colour or Conſiſtence, in thoſe who are Sound. For the <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> of Pale ſtraw-colour'd or other Colours below Citron, ariſe, and may be explicated after the ſame manner we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid of the Water-like, clear <hi>Urine,</hi> from the greater or leſs Diſſolution and Concoction of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> in the <hi>Serum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another kind of <hi>Urine,</hi> more Pale than Citron, yet remains, not at all Thin but Thick, of a ſullied whitiſh Colour, which is commonly obſerv'd, Children make, when their Bowels are much troubled with Wormes; the reaſon of which ſeems to be, becauſe the matter of which Wormes are ingender'd, is a viſcous Phlegm through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion of Chyle and want of Volatilization, heapt up in the Bowels, which doth not readily tranſmit any tincture to the <hi>Urine,</hi> becauſe the matter is fixt; after that, the ſame matter putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, is exalted and volatiliz'd in a manner, and then partly by Heat and Spirit is form'd into Wormes, and that phlegmatick matter, being unfit for nouriſhment, 'tis ſeparated from the Blood with the <hi>Serum</hi> and mixt with the <hi>Urine;</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0206400400:36"/>hence that white Colour and whitiſh Sediment.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in <hi>Feavers,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Urines</hi> of Children grow white; the reaſon of which is, becauſe the ſupply of Nutritive Juice coming from the Chyle to the Maſs of Blood, is not rightly aſſimilated, but degenerates into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Humour, a part of which being incocted in the <hi>Serum,</hi> gives it a more thick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and milkie-colour, otherwiſe than in <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of the Adult, where when the Heat is more ſtrong and vigorous, the mixture of ſuch Juice tinctures the <hi>Serum</hi> with a deep Red.</p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo <hi>Urines</hi> appear white, from a <hi>Gonorrhaea, Flour albus, Ulcers</hi> of the Kidneys, Ureters, or Urinary paſſage, by reaſon of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of Matter or corrupted Seed. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, the white colour of the <hi>Urine,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by its Contents, which falling to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the Liquor for the moſt part becomes of a yelowiſh-pale Colour, like as 'tis ſeen in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> where the Milkie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance falling to the bottom, the Liquor ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming above, is commonly of a Citron colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urines</hi> whoſe Colour is more Intenſe, than Citron, owe not their appearances only to the more than ordinary diſſolution of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> but in ſome meaſure, to the more craſs Contents in the Liquor.</p>
               <p>The plentiful diſſolution of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> is perform'd in the Veſſels containing the very Maſs of Blood, and thence is the Tincture deriv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Serum,</hi> and this for the moſt part, comes to paſs two ways.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> either by reaſon of a Feaveriſh Heat, in as much as the Blood boyling in the Veſſels, and being more accended in the Heart, is much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in its mixture; and therefore the particles of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which are ſeparated by Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, plentifully impregnate the <hi>Serum.</hi> Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> without a <hi>Feaver,</hi> when ſuch like Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and Saline little Bodies, which were wont to be ſent out at other Emunctories, are detain'd; therefore being heapt up, by little and little in the Blood, they are commixt with the <hi>Serum:</hi> Of which, there are two particular Caſes or Modes for either the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Blood, which eſpecially partake of an aduſt <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and ought to be ſent forth by the <hi>Veſicula Fellis,</hi> are retain'd and ſo mixing with the <hi>Serum,</hi> tincture it with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Or the <hi>Effluviums</hi> which are eſpecially of a Saline nature, and were wont to evaporate by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Tranſpiration are retain'd, and by them is the <hi>Urine</hi> tinctur'd, like a <hi>Lixivium</hi> or with a Lye-like colour.</p>
               <p>All Perſons in the <hi>Jaundiſe</hi> have <hi>Urine</hi> of the friſt ſort; but that of the latter, is familiar to the <hi>Scurvy;</hi> for in a Scorhutick Habit, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> Particles of Blood fall ſhort of Volatilizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and become fluid, wherefore by reaſon of fixation, they evaporate leſs, and being plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heap'd up in the Maſs of Blood, they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevent its Mixture, and eſpecially impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnate the <hi>Serum</hi> with <hi>Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Contents which augment the colour of <hi>Urine</hi> are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Either the aduſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0206400400:38"/>Recrements, which are the reliques of the Blood's Inflammation: Or the Particles of the Nutritive Juice, degenerated into an unknown Matter; of which, in their proper place hereafter: Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Task is, a particular decyphering every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that is above Citron.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, The Flame-colour'd <hi>Urine</hi> appears like the yellowiſh red Vapours in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation of <hi>Spiritus Nitri,</hi> and this is very often found in <hi>Intermitting Feavers,</hi> frequently in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> This Colour ariſes from a ſmall portion of thin yellow <hi>Choler,</hi> mix'd with the <hi>Serum,</hi> while 'tis in motion; for in this <hi>Feaver</hi> there is a ſharp and hot Diſtemperature of the Blood, which burnes and in a manner torrifies all the Humours, and therefore plentifully produceth <hi>Choler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' this for the moſt part, is ſent out by the <hi>Ductus bilarius;</hi> notwithſtanding, ſince it abounds in the Veſſels, part of it, or (what's equivalent) the aduſt Particles of Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours being incocted in the <hi>Serum,</hi> tincture it with a deep yellowiſh-red. This <hi>Urine</hi> is Thin and Shining, becauſe in this Diſeaſe, almoſt a continual Sweat forces out the Excrements of the Nutritive Juice and the more groſs part of the <hi>Serum,</hi> to the circumference of the Body. The Saffron-colour'd <hi>Urine,</hi> which dies Linnen-cloth with the ſame colour, is an undoubted Sign of the <hi>Jaundiſe;</hi> and 'tis thus tinctur'd from yellow Choler, or <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> aduſt and plentifully mix'd with the <hi>Serum,</hi> For that Yellow is neceſſarily produc'd by the more than
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0206400400:39"/>ordinary continual motion and over-heat of the Blood: And Nature has deſign'd the <hi>Veſicula Fellis</hi> and its paſſages which are radicated in the Liver, for diſcharging the Choler from the Maſs of Blood. But if this Office of the <hi>Ductus Bila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> in conveying the Gall, be any ways hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that Humour ſtagnating in the Blood and plentifully heap't up there, dies the Skin, Blood, and Urine eſpecially, with a yellow Tincture.</p>
               <p>A Safftron-colour'd, differs from a Flame-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd <hi>Urine;</hi> becauſe in the laſt, only ſome part of the thinner, in the firſt, a more craſs and plentiful part of the <hi>Gall</hi> is incorporated with the <hi>Urine:</hi> Farther, in yellow <hi>Choler, Sulphur</hi> being long circulated with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying <hi>Salt,</hi> is fully diſſolv'd by it, and becomes like Paint, colouring any Subject with a Saffron tincture, like as when common <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and the Oil of <hi>Tartar</hi> are diſſolv'd together.</p>
               <p>But that Redneſs which is in <hi>Urine,</hi> without the ſtagnation of <hi>Choler,</hi> happens after the ſame manner, as in a <hi>Lixivium</hi> or Lie of Aſhes, where the Particles of <hi>Sulphur</hi> without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, from thoſe of <hi>Salt,</hi> together with them are imbib'd in the Liquor.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we will Treat of Red <hi>Urines,</hi> which are of a different Nature, depend upon different Cauſes, and many times ſignify differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds of Affects; the chief of which, and their proper ſignifications we'll briefly deſcribe. Firſt of all, the Liquor grows red of it ſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the ſame Condition, neither is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of any part of it alter'd by Subſidence. Or,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0206400400:40"/>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> the deep dye of <hi>Urine</hi> proceeds eſpecially from what's contain'd in it; and after its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the bottom, it becomes Yellowiſh, or leſs Red than before. The Affects which ſuch <hi>Urines</hi> are wont to ſignify, are eſpecially, <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Scurvy,</hi> and a confirm'd <hi>Conſumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let's conſider the Reaſons of each. When the <hi>Urine</hi> which is made Red, continues ſo. 'Tis either <hi>1ſt,</hi> of an indifferent Conſiſtence and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent, and then it owes its Colour to <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> more than ordinarily aduſt and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plentifully incocted in the <hi>Serum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, <hi>2dly,</hi> Such an <hi>Urine</hi> is Red, as alſo Dark and Muddy and beſides what particles of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> it hath, ſome earthy Particles are emboyl'd in it, which ſticking in the Pores and Paſſages of the <hi>Urine,</hi> do not all precipitate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Liquor of the <hi>Urine</hi> diveſted of its fit Spirits, which wou'd ſeparate and precipitate all parts of a different diſpoſition, as it uſually happens in Wine that hath loſt its Head, or been ſower'd by Thunder; in which Caſe, the Liquor is impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnated with thick and muddy Dreggs, and for want of due Spirits cannot finally clarify and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come limpid as before.</p>
               <p>Hence ſuch <hi>Urine</hi> is the worſt of ſigns in <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> becauſe it ſignifies ſuch a confuſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt matter in the Blood, that ought to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and yet the Vital Spirits cannot bring it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and overcome it. The <hi>Urine</hi> is ſometimes made Red, becauſe of its Contents, which falling to the bottom, the Liquor becomes of another Colour</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0206400400:41"/>
               <p>Now this, as 'tis ſaid above, is two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes thin, which is the matter or remaind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the aduſt Recrements from the deflagration of the Blood: Sometimes thick, <hi>viz.</hi> from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Particles of the Nutritive Juice; both theſe being torrify'd by the Blood's Ebullition and being ſeparated, are partly ſent out by Sweat, and partly mix'd with the <hi>Serum,</hi> whoſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence they thicken, and enhance its Colour, to wit, as long as thoſe Contents are held up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enclos'd in the Pores and Paſſages of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, the Colour appears more deep, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence more thick; but theſe being fallen to the bottom, the Redneſs and Thickneſs of the Liquor are abated: The reaſon of both which ſhall be aſſign'd hereafter, when we aſſert the Cauſes of Clearneſs, Darkneſs, and other Colours of <hi>Urines.</hi> Now let's enquire What's the Reaſon of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that Red <hi>Urines</hi> are wont to be made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>As likewiſe in <hi>Feavers,</hi> the Contents of <hi>Urine</hi> often advance its Colour, that is, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Intemperature and Deflagration of the Blood; for then both the degenerate Particles of the Nutritive Juice, as alſo another matter (like Aſhes remaining from the Calcination of Blood) are burnt, as 'twere into a red <hi>Calx,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut up in the Pores of the <hi>Urine,</hi> render its Colour higher; and afterwards falling to the bottom, becomes a red Sediment, like Painter's <hi>Oaker</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> In an inveterate <hi>Scurvy,</hi> the <hi>Urine</hi> is often ſo high colour'd, that 'tis not exceeded in a violent burning <hi>Feaver,</hi> which (if evaporated or diſtill'd) yields plenty of <hi>Salt</hi> with ſlimy Dreggs, wherefore it ſeems evident by this Experiment. that this high Colour, owes its original to <hi>Salt</hi> Principles, as was hinted before; becauſe in <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Caſes, thoſe <hi>Salt</hi> Particles, which ought to be Volatiliz'd, and ſent forth by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tranſpiration, are fix'd and reſtrain'd from their uſual Motion, and therefore are more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully heap'd up in the affected Body. This <hi>Salt</hi> (afore-ſaid) remaining within, with <hi>Sulphur</hi> and Earth, is diverſly coagulated, and then plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully reſolv'd. And from this different Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Re-diſſolution, follows wonderful Symptoms of this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe from theſe <hi>Saline</hi> Particles, plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſſolv'd with ſome <hi>Tartarous</hi> Dreggs, and diluted with the <hi>Serum, Urines</hi> become tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd with adeep and high Red. Beſides in this Affect, when inveterate, the courſe and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0206400400:43"/>of the Liver and <hi>Veſicula Fellis</hi> being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and deprav'd, they perform their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice worſe, in ſeparating the aduſt Particles of Blood from the reſt of the Maſs, which being plentifully loaded with it, and diſſolv'd in the <hi>Serum,</hi> do the more dye it with a Lie-like Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. And if thoſe Particles of aduſt <hi>Sulphur,</hi> over-ballance thoſe of a fix'd and <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Salt, the <hi>Jaundiſe</hi> is in complication with the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and the <hi>Urine</hi> then dyes Linnen with a Saffron-colour.</p>
               <p>But if they be exceeded by the <hi>Saline</hi> Particles, only a <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Affect is produc'd, in which the <hi>Urine</hi> is highly red; but yet will not make yellow Linnen. That 'tis thus, it is highly probable; for, in Diſſecting many of thoſe, who had frequently made red <hi>Urine</hi> and dy'd of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> it has has been obſerv'd, that their Liver or the <hi>Veſicu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>

               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Salt</hi> ſo diſſolv'd, the <hi>Urines</hi> are ſometimes Red in <hi>Gouty</hi> Diſeaſes for beſides the <hi>Arthritik</hi> Fits (in which ſuch <hi>Urine</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made) I have obſerv'd, in ſome very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Affects, imitating, in a manner, a <hi>Feaver,</hi> with a deep red <hi>Urine,</hi> wandring Pains, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times raging in this, ſometimes in that Part; ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0206400400:44"/>that the afficted Patient could ſcarce ſtand upon his Feet, or move a Member; troubled alſo with Watchings and frequent Sweats, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Thirſt, great dryneſs of the Jaws, the <hi>Urine</hi> very red, with a plentiful Sediment; yet in the interim, 'twas not evident, that there was any great Ebullition in the Blood, that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was under any great Languor of Spirits, or <hi>Head-ach,</hi> whereupon I ſuſpected this Affect was eſpecially from the <hi>genus Nervoſum,</hi> chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Exorbitances of a Saline, rather than a Sulphureous Principle.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4ly,</hi> Likewiſe the <hi>Urine</hi> is Red in a confirm'd <hi>Conſumption,</hi> eſpecially if a <hi>Hectick</hi> (as 'tis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally) be join'd with it. The reaſon of which is, if at any time an <hi>Ulcer</hi> has ſeiz'd the <hi>Lungs;</hi> from thence, a putrid Matter being mix'd with the Blood in it's Circulation, cauſes almoſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Ebullition; whereby the <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and <hi>Saline</hi> Particles, being more plentifully diſſolv'd and incocted in the <hi>Serum,</hi> render its Liquor Red: Beſides, by reaſon the Blood is thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated, almoſt all the Nutritive Juice dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates into Putrefaction, and with thoſe Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the <hi>Urine</hi> being impregnated, grows more Red, and is plentifully ſtuſſ d with its Contents. An evidence of which is, that <hi>Conſumptive</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are for the moſt part, hot after Meat, their whole Body being put into a <hi>Feaveriſh</hi>-heat, which is ſucceeded by <hi>Nocturnal</hi> Sweats. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there is in the <hi>Urines</hi> a thick and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sediment, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nutritive Juice being mix'd with the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0206400400:45"/>Blood, and not rightly aſſimilated, cauſeth an Ebullition in it, and degenerating into ſome ſtrange Matter, is partly driven through the Skin, partly tranſmitted by <hi>Urine,</hi> and partly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments its Colour and Conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Hitherto have we Treated of Red <hi>Urines;</hi> and every kind of 'em now hinted at, have many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of intenſion and remiſſion; for as the Cauſes change in them, ſo in the Colour and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence they are either weaker or ſtronger.</p>
               <p>As for Green or Black <hi>Urine,</hi> I confeſs, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw any that was either exactly green as Leeks, or black as Ink. But I think, from a very high yellow, with a dark or ſomewhat Inky mixture, the appearances of greeniſh or blackiſh <hi>Urine</hi> may ariſe, which Authors uſually call green or black <hi>Urine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe <hi>Urines</hi> which are thus colour'd, do either conſtantly remain in the ſame ſtate for ſome time, and are ſigns of the <hi>Black-Jaundiſe,</hi> or the Blood affected with ſome Virulency; or the <hi>Urines</hi> are occaſionally diverſly chang'd, and are ſometimes of that, and ſometimes preſently of another Colour; ſo that I have known <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriacal</hi> Perſons wont firſt to make ſuch <hi>Urines,</hi> and then a little after, like thoſe of ſound Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>As to the former, when the <hi>Jaundiſe</hi> grows very high, ſo that the aduſt portion of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> have a longer continuance in the Maſs of Blood, theſe ſame by long incoction, acquire a Colour more deep than yellow; <hi>viz.</hi> at firſt Greeniſh, and then afterwards ſomewhat Black,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0206400400:46"/>with which the <hi>Serum</hi> is in like manner tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd. For if yellow Gall be taken out of the <hi>Veſicula Fellis,</hi> and put into a Bolt-head, and expos'd to the gentle heat of a warm Bath, it waxes ſhortly green, and afterwards by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will appear almoſt as black as Ink. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>Black-Jaundiſe,</hi> which is only the Yellow, by longer continuance advanc'd into a greater degeneracy, there's nothing more uſual than an Inky-<hi>Urine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, ſuch <hi>Urines</hi> ſometimes appear in a malignant <hi>Feaver</hi> and the <hi>Plague,</hi> as alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently after the drinking of Poyſon, and in theſe Caſes, are commonly a deadly Sign; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they argue the Blood much corrupted, and as 'twere mortify'd, the Spirits being vanquiſh'd, and the bond of mixture loos'd, juſt as when a part in our Bodies is Ulcerated, and afterwards perverted into a <hi>Gangrene</hi> or Mortification, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Piſs, which before was wateriſh, white or yellow, becomes black. Wherefore in the aforeſaid Affects, when the <hi>Urine</hi> grows black, the <hi>Serum</hi> and Blood being wholly vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the outward Skin is likewiſe darkned with ſuch a Colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urines</hi> that are tinctur'd with a greeniſh, or eſpecially a black Colour, at certain times which often happens to <hi>Hypocondriacks</hi>) very likely proceed from the Dregs of the <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> or the black Choler entreaſur'd in the <hi>Spleen;</hi> and then through too plentiful congeſtion, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing at ſometimes, mix with the Maſs of Blood: For ſuch Matter being often effunded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0206400400:47"/>the Stomachs of ſome Men, produces greeniſh or inky Vomits: As likewiſe in others, the ſame Matter being ſuck'd up by the Blood, in its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, may tincture the <hi>Urine</hi> with ſuch like Colours.</p>
               <p>Hitherto have we ſpoken of the Colours of <hi>Urines:</hi> Thoſe that are Pale, proceed from too much Crudity; almoſt all thoſe that are High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd, ariſe either from <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Sulphur</hi> too plentifully diſſolv'd, and ſometimes, from the aduſt Recrements throughly incocted in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> or from the more craſs Contents of the <hi>Urine,</hi> whether they be the very <hi>Calx</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Aliment degenerated in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, or the Liquations and mouldrings of the Conſumptive Body, or ſome ill-affected Part thereof; which expreſſions will be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if we explain the manner, how ſuch-like Diſſolutions and Contents may diverſly change the Colour of <hi>Urine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cauſes of different Appearances and changeable Colours, as alſo of Darkneſs and Tranſparency in <hi>Urines</hi> (as in other Liquors) depend wholly on the different immiſſion and emmiſſion of the Rays of Light.</p>
               <p>For, if the body of the Liquor be thin, with open Pores and Paſſages, that the Rays of Light may be eaſily tranſmitted, 'tis then Tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and Clear, like Fountain-water: But if the Pores of the Liquor be ſtuff'd with Contents, or little Bodies ſwimming in it, ſo that the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating Rays be refracted and broken in the tranſmiſſion, at laſt when they appear accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0206400400:48"/>to the different Modes of Refraction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, in the (as yet) diaphanous Liquor, the Colour will appear either Citron, Saffron, or Red.</p>
               <p>But if the ſpaces of the Pores, be yet more poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, ſo that the Light be not at all tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from thence Darkneſs will proceed: But then if the Rays once receiv'd, be but little or not at all reflected, the Liquor will appear of a dusky or blackiſh Colour. But if they be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected according to the different modes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, the appearance will be White, Aſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd, or of another kind; upon this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that as the Liquor of the <hi>Urine</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a manner, almoſt devoid of <hi>Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and other Diſſolvables, it eaſily tranſmits the Light. Sometimes being moderately, or much ſtuft'd with ſuch-like Contents, it either diſtorts the incident Rays in their paſſage, or wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibes them, or laſtly reflects them: So that from hence, 'tis eaſy to unfold all the <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> of Colours and Conſiſtence in <hi>Urines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It happens frequently, that the Colour of the ſame <hi>Urine</hi> is much chang'd; for that which is made Red, being expos'd to the Air, becomes White or of a Darkiſh-colour, and then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after of a Citron colour; the reaſon of which appearance ſeems to be this:</p>
               <p>This <hi>Urine</hi> when made is red, becauſe the Pores of the Liquor are much poſſeſs'd with the Contents: Yet as long as thoſe Pores are kept open by Heat, they tranſmit the Rays of Light in ſuch manner (tho' diverſly diſtorted) that they by way of Reflection, rebound again.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0206400400:49"/>
               <p>But this <hi>Urine,</hi> is no ſooner expos'd to the cold Air, but the Pores being ſhut up, the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parts are chang'd in the Contents, and therefore the tranſmiſſion of the Rays of Light is hinder'd, wherefore the Liquor becomes preſently dark, and as thoſe Rays are reflected this or that way, the Colour becomes white, dusky, or ſome other Colour. But at laſt the Contents, by their weight, falling to the bottom, the Pores being freed, eaſily tranſmit the Rays of Light, and do leſs diſtort them; wherefore the Colour appears not high, but Citron.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid concerning the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Urines,</hi> it may appear what's the Cauſes of the different Conſiſtence of <hi>Urines:</hi> For as the Particles of <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> or aduſt Matter, or the Nutritive Juice depriv'd of a right Aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, are more or leſs incocted in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the <hi>Urines</hi> become more or leſs Thick or Thin in their Conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>In the next place it remains, we ſpeak of the Preternatural Contents in <hi>Urine.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning the Contents in the <hi>Urines</hi> of the Sick.</head>
               <p>WE acknowledge the Contents to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, in the <hi>Urine</hi> of the Sick, <hi>viz.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Univerſal,</hi> which proceed from the Maſs of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0206400400:50"/>Blood and <hi>ſuccus Nervoſus,</hi> and reſpect the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the whole Body: Or Particular, which are the Excrements and refuſe of ſome Bowel or Part ill-affected; concerning which, by and by.</p>
               <p>Theſe of the former kind, which proceed from the Habit of the whole Body, are either Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to wit, the Filaments making up the <hi>Nube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> or Urine-cloud, as in ſound Perſons: Or Preternatural, which eſpecially are the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Nutritive Juice degenerated in Aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, making up thoſe more craſs Bodies of the Sediments in <hi>Urines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly (in a <hi>Feaver</hi>) ſome aduſt Matter from the Inflammation of the Blood, diluted with the <hi>Serum,</hi> is added, which augments the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Contents.</p>
               <p>But theſe, as well Natural as Preternatural Contents of <hi>Urines,</hi> are very different, as the Blood is more or leſs diſorderly or unduly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe, as the Aliment in the Bowels and Veſſels is diverſly concocted; and either the ſuperfluities or refuſe of the Chyle, which is made thence, are waſh'd off with the <hi>Serum:</hi> And if the Nutritive Juice ſent to the Blood, be not wholly perverted, but a great part chang'd into Nouriſhment, for the augmentation of the ſolid parts; then likewiſe a part of this being mix'd with the <hi>Serum,</hi> leaves ſome foot-ſteps of an Urine-cloud. And if that Preternatural Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, which is made up of a degenerate or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt Matter, be yet but little and thin, it doth not, as yet, wholly obliterate the appearance of this, which is Natural.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0206400400:51"/>
               <p>Hence, in the beginning and declenſion of <hi>Feavers,</hi> and ſometimes in a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> or in a <hi>Cachexia</hi> or an ill Habit of Body, the <hi>Nube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> or Urine-cloud is ſeen, tho' not ſo perfect. But if the greater part of the Chyle, boiling with the Blood, through its immoderate heat, be perverted into an heterogeneal Matter, which afterwards, as hurtful and unprofitable, is ſent out with the <hi>Serum,</hi> the Urine-cloud forthwith becomes obſcure and imperfect: Alſo beſides that, there are many Contents in the <hi>Urines</hi> which enhance their Colour and Conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Such <hi>Urine</hi> which has in it a Urine-cloud, tho' imperfect, if it be kept in a hot place, the <hi>Nube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> only is viſible, and the reſt of the Contents, being kept in the Pores of the <hi>Urine,</hi> while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd by Heat, become utterly inviſible; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſame Contents (the little ſpaces of the Pores being ſtraitned by Cold) are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated, and thereupon changing their place and ſituation, rendet the <hi>Urine</hi> dark and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, obliterating the appearance of the Urine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud. Such <hi>Urines</hi> are commonly made in the better ſtate of <hi>Feavers,</hi> a <hi>Catarrh, Cough,</hi> want of Tranſpiration, a <hi>Caccchymia</hi> (or the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Ill-humours in the Blood) and in moſt of the higher ſort of <hi>Dyſcrafies, i. e,</hi> evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion or Temperature.</p>
               <p>But if the Sickneſs be ſo far advanc'd, that the Concoction and Nutritive Juice be wholly chang'd into Putrefaction, ſuch like, are plainly viſible in the <hi>Urine,</hi> and that without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an Urine cloud, and do ſignify a great
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0206400400:52"/>diverſity in Diſeaſes, as they are precipitated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways, and make a Sediment of divers kinds, as there is a ſudden, ſlow, or no Separation at all of Parts, and as the Matter falling is Little or Much; White, Red, or Dusky: I ſhall briefly run through all the material or chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations concerning this Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Urine</hi> Impregnated with ſuch Contents, ſometimes is not precipitated at all, (unleſs it be after a long time, the body of the Liquor dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Putrefaction) but remains a long time troubled and ſomewhat dark, the little Bodies floating all over it. The reaſon of this is, either becauſe theſe Contents are too deeply incocted in the <hi>Serum,</hi> ſo that the Innate Spirits cannot ſeperate the Pure from the Impure, the Thick from the Thin; as is ſeen in the Brewing of Beer, in which if too much of the Mealy-part of the Malt be commixt, the Liquor will ſcarce ever after become Clear: Or likewiſe the <hi>Urine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains troubled, becauſe 'tis utterly deſtitute of Spirits which might ferment the parts of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; as 'tis wont to happen in Beer that grows ſour by reaſon of Thunder, or immoderate Heat, and being loaded with muddy Dreggs, is ſeldom or ever, rightly depurated again. Such like <hi>Urine</hi> in <hi>Feavers,</hi> is for the moſt part, very dangerous: Sometimes alſo it denotes an irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable <hi>Cachexia,</hi> and always intimates a very ill Sign.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> It ſometimes happens that the <hi>Urine</hi> is ſo impregnated with Contents, that they begin to precipitate while it's yet hot. I have often
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0206400400:53"/>obſerv'd it thus in a lingring <hi>Feaver,</hi> where the Heat is more mild and remiſs, in which, the Particles of the Thick Nouriſhment are deprav'd, and being leſs conquer'd by that Heat, or leſs incocted in the <hi>Serum,</hi> do more eaſily fall from its Pores; like as when common <hi>Sulphur</hi> is boyl'd in a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> if it be remov'd from the Fire before a perfect diſſolution, the Liquor that is at firſt clear and red, becauſe of the ſudden pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitation of the diſſolv'd Contents, forthwith becomes turbid, obſcure, and of a whitiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> What uſually happens: The <hi>Urine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much impregnated with ſuch like Contents, as long as 'tis hot, and ſometime after, appears clear and tranſparent; but when it grows cold by degrees, it waxeth turbid, and (as if ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd <hi>Coagulum,</hi> or curdling Matter had mix'd with all its parts) is precipitated, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if it be kept at the Fire, or in a hot place, grows clear again. The reaſon of which, is ſufficiently Explain'd before, where we ſpoke of the Cauſes of Darkneſs and Tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> After the <hi>Urine</hi> expos'd to cold is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated in manner aforeſaid, it may be obſerv'd how its Contents fall to the bottom. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they fall in a ſhort time, and if in the ſpace of two or three Hours the Liquor grows clear, 'tis a Sign the <hi>Urine</hi> is not ſtuff'd, nor much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur;</hi> hence in the beginning and declenſion of <hi>Feavers,</hi> when the Heat is remiſs, ſuch <hi>Urine</hi> is often made. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0206400400:54"/>except in the ſpace of many Days, ſuch a ſubſidence of Contents will not enſue; becauſe the conſiſtence of the <hi>Urine</hi> is thicker than it ought to be; therefore it cannot let go its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents out of its embraces ſo eaſily, that by their gravity they may find the bottom.</p>
               <p>Such <hi>Urines</hi> are generally made in the ſtate of <hi>Feavers,</hi> and are the fore-runners of an ill <hi>Criſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> The Sediments which fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, are not leſs differing; in this place, paſſing by Corruption and Blood, Sand and Gravel, and certain other depoſited parts.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that are the products of the whole Body, are for the moſt part white, dusky or like red <hi>Oker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Urine,</hi> after it has ſtood long, be filter'd through Cap-paper, ſuch Contents are retain'd, and may be plainly examin'd. I have often ſeen white Sediments like <hi>Chalk;</hi> ſometimes red, like <hi>Armenian</hi> Bole, and without doubt, the matter of all is the ſame; <hi>viz.</hi> the Recrements of the Blood after its Inflamation, and the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive Juice deprav'd in Aſſimilation, which as they are concocted in our Bodies by Heat and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly perverted, they appear likewiſe in <hi>Urine,</hi> under a different Colour and Form. As <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> mix'd with <hi>Nitre,</hi> and more or leſs Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd, produceth a <hi>Calx</hi> ſometimes red, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Saffron-colour'd, ſometimes yellow and ſometimes dusky.</p>
               <p>The like Reaſon, as it ſeems, may be render'd concerning the Sediments of <hi>Urines,</hi> which are,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0206400400:55"/>as 'twere the <hi>Calx</hi> of a Sulphureous and Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Matter over-burnt by the heat of a <hi>Feaver</hi> in the Bowels and Veſſels.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6thly,</hi> Beſides ſuch uſual Contents in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> of the Sick, I have often obſerv'd, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> had ſtood ſometime in a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, ſome Sand-like Matter cleav'd to the ſides thereof, and that under a different figure; For ſometimes theſe little Bodies are like Sands with a rough and unequal Surface.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they grow together with ridge and furrow like the Chryſtals of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and are ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and gliſtring like Ice; ſometimes I have ſeen ſuch-like Chryſtals ſtick to the ſides of the Pot, from thoſe who had labour'd under a <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteria</hi> or <hi>Bloody-flux.</hi> Sometimes in <hi>Urines,</hi> when they have ſtood a while, there appears a Scumm ſwimming at top, juſt like <hi>Tartar,</hi> when boyl'd in Water. That whitiſh Cruſt, coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſurface of the <hi>Urine,</hi> is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be both Fat and Oily, and is accounted a Liquation or melting away of the ſolid Parts; thoſe therefore, who make this <hi>Urine,</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently pronounc'd Conſumptive and very deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>But this Concretion is only <hi>Saline,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expos'd to the Fire, is not at all diſſolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but is condens'd into a cruſty Subſtance. Moreover, both theſe and the reſt of the Incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of <hi>Urines,</hi> are a kind of <hi>Tartar,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in them by a certain coagulation. Such a Concretion wholly depends on the Particles of a fluid and acid <hi>Salt,</hi> combin'd with thoſe of a fixt or Alkaliz'd <hi>Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0206400400:56"/>
               <p>For, in any Subject, where this commixture of <hi>Salts</hi> of both kinds doth happen, whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Naturally, or by Artificial Operation, there enſue diverſe kinds of Coagulations and Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizations.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſuch kind of <hi>Urine,</hi> on which there ſwims a <hi>Tartar</hi>-like Scum, or in which, Cryſtals cleave to the ſide of the Pot or Urinal, ſhew that the Blood is degenerated from its Sweet Balſamick Nature (ſuch as is the reſult of <hi>Salt</hi> Volatiliz'd) into an Acid and Corroſive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the fludity and fixation of a <hi>Saline</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: Such <hi>Urine,</hi> if evaporated, leaves great ſtore of <hi>Salt</hi> in the bottom of the Veſſel. The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which, as 'tis often obſervable (as I have experienc'd) are ſpitting of Blood, an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophy</hi> and an <hi>Hypocondriacal</hi> Diſpoſition. 'Tis worthy Obſervation, Whether the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines</hi> of Sick Perſons, give a Tincture to the Chamber-pot, or not; for ſometimes in <hi>Feavers,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is no ſooner put into a Glaſs, but preſently it darkens its ſides with a whitiſh-cloud, yet, at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, 'twill not happen ſo. I think, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that ſully'd dye on the Glaſs, is, becauſe the <hi>Urine</hi> is more impregnated with a diſſolv'd <hi>Sulphur,</hi> than its Pores can contain in them. For every Liquor, that is too much impregnated with <hi>Sulphur</hi> doth the ſame. As 'tis ſeen in a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> in which common <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> hath been boil'd.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe every <hi>Urine,</hi> if it ſtands in a Glaſs till it putrefies, it tinctures its ſides with a Clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyneſs, or ſome cruſty Matter, ſometimes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0206400400:57"/>or red, or ſometimes of another Colour. For the Fabrick of the <hi>Urine</hi> being loos'd by Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, the Particles being freed from the bond of mixture, are faſten'd and adhere to the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>Now further, in the <hi>Urines</hi> of Sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, this happens forthwith, becauſe the <hi>Sul phar</hi> is more plentifully diſſolv'd in the <hi>Serum,</hi> than can be contain'd in the Pores.</p>
               <p>Now as for the particular Contents of <hi>Urine,</hi> thoſe indeed are manifold, and may proceed from divers Places and Parts: Yet very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from Diſeaſes ſeated about the Kidneys, Bladder, and Urinary Paſſages; ſometimes happening from an <hi>Ulcer</hi> in the Liver, Spleen, Lungs or other Bowels; or becauſe ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Humours are heap'd up in thoſe Places and over-flow, through their Superabundancy; hence ſome extraneous or foreign Matter is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Maſs of Blood and thence into the <hi>Serum;</hi> yet this happens but ſeldom: For when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n <hi>Impoſtume</hi> is broke within, for the moſt part, it ſends its Matter into the Cavity of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, from which there are no paſſages to the Urinary Conduits.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Maſs of Blood being impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Impurities, Nature doth not preſently endeavour to ſend them out by <hi>Urine,</hi> but often by Swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, <hi>Expectoration,</hi> throwing out of Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Wheals or Tumours, and by other ways of Excretion. 'Tis hence commonly obſerv'd, that other Contents of <hi>Urines</hi> (beſides what we have ſpoken of above) are especially ſent from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0206400400:58"/>the Kidneys, or their Appendages. The chief of which are Sand, Stones, Blood, purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, little pieces of Fleſh, ſmall Skins, or mealy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; which for the moſt part ſignifie either ſome great <hi>Ulcer,</hi> or the <hi>Stone,</hi> or both together ſeated beyond the Emulgent Veſſels.</p>
               <p>'Tis uſual with ſome, to piſs little Grains of Sand of a red Colour, in great quantity: Some of thoſe are troubled with the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and often have thoſe <hi>Nephritick</hi> Fits: Yet I have known others void Gravel a long time without Pain, or any other grievous Symptom.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Urines,</hi> if they ſtand long in an earthen glaz'd Veſſel, ſometimes leave ſuch a Gravel ſticking to the ſides or bottom, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile-ſalt of <hi>Urine,</hi> is coagulated with the ſix'd-ſalt of the Metal. So when <hi>Sal Armoniacum,</hi> mix'd with the ſilings of Steel, <hi>Vitrioline</hi> or Sea-ſalt, is ſublim'd, the elevated Flowers grow eminently red.</p>
               <p>Wherefore 'tis probable, that ſuch-like Red grains of Sand, are produc'd in the Kidneys; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of <hi>Urine,</hi> is coagulated with the dregs of ſome Tartarous matter, left about the Meanders or windings of the Reins, and thereupon is that Sandy matter made, which forthwith, is waſht away by the <hi>Serum,</hi> in its paſſage; therefore thoſe grains of <hi>Sand,</hi> which are ſo often made, are not the piece-meal moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings of ſome greater Stones, (as 'tis Vulgarly believ'd) but the extemporary products of the Blood and <hi>Serum,</hi> while they paſs the Chanels of the Kidneys.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0206400400:59"/>
               <p>How Stones are produc'd in the Bladder and Reins, is not the enquiry of this place, fully to diſcuſs; yet beyond all peradventure, rather by Coagulation, than Exſiccation or Calefaction.</p>
               <p>I have obſerv'd ſome Men afflicted with the Stone in the Bladder, who after they had made Water, were wont with much Labour and Grief to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Leſſer ſtones paſs the Urinary paſſages, and are ejected with little or no difficulty; but 'tis better, that thoſe, that are great, reſt quietly in their Dens.</p>
               <p>The places in which they are uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, are the crooked Paſſages and Winding Meanders of the Reins, from whence thoſe that are leſs, fall into the Bladder, and if they be not ejected from thence, grow very great.</p>

Theſe without doubt, while leſs, were ſent from the Reins and detain'd in the paſſages of the Ureters that creep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tunicks of the Bladder, and there by degrees were augmented in bulk. The poor Gentlewoman who was thus troubled, long before her Death, avoided a Membrane thick and

               <p>'Tis ordinary with thoſe who have the <hi>Stone,</hi> to emit both Blood and purulent Matter fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with their <hi>

               <p>HItherto concerning the Anatomy of <hi>Urines,</hi> in which their Elementary and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Principles, together with their chief Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: to wit, Colour, Conſiſtence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as well thoſe that might be in them Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and Eſſentially, as thoſe that are wont Preternaturally to happen to them, by reaſon of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0206400400:64"/>the Body being ill-affected. Hence 'tis not very difficult for any to bring this Hypotheſis to Practice, and to paſs Judgment upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines,</hi> by a right Examination of the Urinal; for by what has been ſaid, 'tis manifeſt, of what Parts the Diſeaſes are diſcoverable by Inſpection of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and what the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> ſignifies in every Particular of them. Concerning this Subject, ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have ſufficiently Treated; wherefore I ſhall paſs over this Matter more briefly.</p>
               <p>Although the principal Matter of the <hi>Urine, viz.</hi> the <hi>Serum,</hi> doth paſs by every Region of the Body, and Circulates together with the Blood through every part, yet it diſcovers not the State and Diſeaſes of them all, but of thoſe only to which it owes its natural Perfection and Original, or from which it receives ſome Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; wherefore in ſome ſort it diſcovers the Action and Temper of thoſe Bowels which ſerve for Concoction: And beſides, it hints at the Motion and Temper of the Blood and Humours in the Veſſels. But that any ſhould pretend to gueſs, and pronounce a Pain in the Head, an <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> in the Throat, or any other Affect, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part (from whence nothing is communicated to the <hi>Serum</hi>) by the Urinal only, he will rather ſuggeſt to us, a Symptom of his Ignorance, than one of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Urines</hi> that are brought from ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſometimes perfectly reſemble thoſe of the Sound, and then they give no light to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or Part affected. But upon inſpection, ſomething Negatively may be ſaid, That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0206400400:65"/>is free from a <hi>Feaver,</hi> and that as to his Stomach and Concoction of Nouriſhment, they are not very bad: Wherefore except he be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> or labour under an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> or ſome other Diſeaſe of Solution of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity: the Affect whatever it be, is not very dangerous or difficult to Cure. But yet, I would not have him ſay any thing raſhly, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo far, from whence he can have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Retreat: For it has ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the moſt grievous Affects, to wit, in a <hi>Malignant Feaver,</hi> when the Patient lay very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly Sick, his ſtrength greatly dejected, the Pulſe weak and unequal, an Eruption of Spots, and other very ill Symptoms accruing, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Accidents, the <hi>Urine</hi> has been laudable, like that of Sound Perſons, as to the Colour, Conſiſtence and <hi>Hypoſtaſis;</hi> ſo that in ſuch a Caſe the Phyſician having only a ſight of the <hi>Urine,</hi> will err groſly, as to the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick: Wherefore except other Symptoms coindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, Credit is ſcarcely to be given to the ſingle Teſtimony of the <hi>Urine.</hi> That ſometimes it thus happens in the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Malignant Feavers,</hi> proceeds from this Reaſon, becauſe the Blood is corrupted in thoſe Diſeaſes, many times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great Ebullition, and as 'twere ſilently; ſo that although its <hi>Serum</hi> be affected with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of Coagulation, yet becauſe at the ſame time, the Blood doth not produce any heap of aduſt Matter, by its intenſe Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is little, or not at all altered from its wonted Craſis or Tenor; hence (I ſay) the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0206400400:66"/>
                  <hi>Urine</hi> that ſometimes cannot carry with it any ſuch aduſt Recrements, in the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Affects, becomes a perfect Cheat. Beſides, many times in ſuch an Inflammation, when the Ebullition of the Blood is very great, whatever Excrementitious Matter is heap'd together in its Maſs, it's preſently carry'd to the Brain, and <hi>genus Nervoſum;</hi> wherefore the <hi>Serum</hi> is uſually freed from Preternatural Contents: Therefore except in theſe Caſes, when the <hi>Urines</hi> are high-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, Turbid, and without any Sediment, there's no reaſon why the <hi>Water-Prophet</hi> ſhould much ſtick in making his Prognoſtick</p>
               <p>As often as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines</hi> of Sick Perſons, are not like thoſe of Sound Men, either ſomething Natural is Deficient, or ſomething Preternatural is Superfluous, or both together may happen. Firſt, Colour, Conſiſtence, Contents, and Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity may be defective; if the Colour be more remiſs, than what it ought to be; if very Pale, it diſcovers Crudity and want of Spiritualizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Nutritive Juice is neither ſo rightly concocted or exalted in the Bowels and Veſſels, that the <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphureous</hi> Particles in Sublimation together, may follow the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the <hi>Serum</hi> (as 'twere in Diſtillation) ſo far as wholly to cleave to it, and tincture it. Wherefore upon the ſight of ſuch an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> thou may'ſt (and that without folly) gueſs at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Symptoms; to wit, that there is an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Heavineſs in the Stomach, want of Appetite, hardneſs of Digeſtion, Drowſineſs, a difficulty of Breathing, frequent Palpitation of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0206400400:67"/>the Heart, (in any Exerciſe more than ordinary) a pale Countenance, ſwelling of the Feet and Belly, and that there is danger of falling into (if he is not already in) a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> or elſe a <hi>Dropſie;</hi> and if the Perſon is one of the Fair Sex, that ſhe is, or will be affected with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of Appetite or the <hi>Green-ſickneſs.</hi> But if in a <hi>Feaver,</hi> the Colour of <hi>Urines</hi> be abated without a Criſis, 'tis a ſign that the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Matter, or the aduſt Recrements of the Blood are excluded from its reception, and fix'd ſomewhere elſe, which happens for the moſt part in the Brain; and then ſuch <hi>Urines</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Prognoſticate a <hi>Delirium;</hi> or ſometimes, a <hi>Pleuriſie:</hi> In <hi>Nephritick</hi> Perſons, a ſudden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the <hi>Urine</hi> into a pale-colour, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh, fore-tells an approaching Fit of the <hi>Stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A pale and plentiful <hi>Urine,</hi> often declares a too great diſſolution of <hi>Salts,</hi> by which Seroſities are ſent from the whole Body, and eſpecially from the Nervous Parts, as 'twere in a certain Inundation. Such an Excretion is ſometimes wholeſome, as 'twere Critical, when the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities happen only to be ſent forth; Sometimes Symptomatical, and brings a great Weakneſs, becauſe then, the Nutritious Juice and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Humours, are ſent out together with it.</p>
               <p>If the Conſiſtence be thin, and the Liquor pale, it argues Crudity and want of Spiritualiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or a Diſpoſition to a <hi>Nephritick</hi> Paroxſym, (as afore-mention'd) or elſe, it proceeds from too large a potation of Drink. But if the Colour be flaming, 'tis a ſign of an Intermitting, <hi>Tertian.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0206400400:68"/>
               <p>If there be no Contents and the <hi>Urine</hi> pale, 'tis a ſign of Inconcoction and a Cachectick Affect of the Body; but if the Colour be Citron, and the <hi>Urine</hi> of an indifferent Conſiſtence without any <hi>Nubecula,</hi> or Urine-cloud, you may ſuſpect the ſick Perſon to have accuſtom'd himſelf to too much Excerciſe and hard-labour; or is frequently troubled with Nocturnal Sweats; or paradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in a <hi>Conſumption</hi> or inclinable to it. But if the <hi>Urine</hi> be daily made in a leſs quantity than is meet, unleſs there be a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary plentiful Sweating, 'tis a ſign the Blood is not ſufficiently diſcharg'd of lis <hi>Serum,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity it becomes more pale and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and at laſt a <hi>Cachectick</hi> Diſpoſition, or elſe an <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> or <hi>Dropſy</hi> of the whole Body fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. But if it be ſtop'd ſuddenly and voided with pain and difficulty, 'tis a ſign of ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect belonging to the Kidneys or Bladder.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Something Superfluous is ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Urine; viz.</hi> The Colour is ſometimes augmented, when, in the mean time, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and Contents are in their due order, and then there's a ſuſpicion of a diſpoſition to a <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> or an <hi>Hectick</hi> begun: Perhaps ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſe fore-runneth, as great Heat from Bathing, Drunkenneſs, or immoderate Exerciſe, which might over-heat the Blood; or ſome great Cold was unwarily taken, whereupon enſu'd a cloſure of the Pores, and conſequently want of Tranſpiration. If the <hi>Urine</hi> be Saffron-colour'd, and give that dye to Linnen cloth, the Diſeaſe is undoubtedly the <hi>Jaundiſe.</hi> But if it be of an
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0206400400:69"/>intenſe Red without a <hi>Feaver,</hi> for the moſt part it argues a <hi>Scorbutick</hi> or <hi>Hypocondriack</hi> Affect. Although the Colour and <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> be both as they ought, yet Preternatural Contents are often lodg'd in the <hi>Urine;</hi> therefore, when it grows cold, 'tis turbid, and leaves a Sediment, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times White, and then there's a ſuſpicion that the Blood is fill'd with many Impurities; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Stomach is loaded with an Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Matter, or troubled with Worms. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Sediment is Red, which commonly happers by reaſon that Tranſpiration is hinder'd and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtructed; to which a <hi>Feaver,</hi> if not a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> may owe its original. Although the <hi>Urine</hi> be in a Natural State, yet ſometimes more than ordinary thick Contents are in it, which argues, that ſome Parts about the Urinary Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, are either Ulcerated, or ſuffer ſome other way; whence purulent Matter, <hi>Fluxus albus,</hi> contaminated Seed, or ſuch like, are mix'd in the <hi>Urine.</hi> You may therefore eaſily diſcover by asking the Patient, How he is in this or that Place, which is the Place affected; and ſo you may be aſcertain'd of the Nature of the Affect, by recollecting what Diſeaſe the Sediment of ſuch <hi>Urines</hi> will ſhew.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Urine</hi> has ſtood for ſome time, and a white and plentiful Sediment appears in it, 'tis not eaſy at the firſt ſight to diſcover whence it proceeds, whether from the whole Maſs of Blood, or from ſome particular Bowel appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Preparation of the <hi>Serum</hi> or <hi>Sperma.</hi> For, the Impurities of the Blood <hi>ſuccus Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſus,</hi>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0206400400:71"/>Accidents are depoſited in their room; and then 'tis a ſign the whole Body is diſtemper'd, and the Concoction is deprav'd in the Bowels and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Then may you ſay, the ſick Perſon is in a <hi>Feaver;</hi> and alſo by asking Queſtions, you may learn, and forthwith pronounce, That he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Thirſt, great Heat, want of Appetite, Watchings, and other Symptoms deducible from hence by conſequence.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> falls ſhort of its natural State, yet doth not at all indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Affect of which the Patient complains, and it either ſhews the Cauſes of the Diſeaſe, or the conſent of another Part with the affected Part. As if any one ſhould complain of a violent <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,</hi> or Trembling of the Heart, and ſhould make a wateriſh <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> this doth not denote the very Affects, but only the Crudity of the Stomach, as alſo an Obſtruction of the <hi>Spleen</hi> and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bowels, which may be the Cauſe of thoſe Affects. I ſay in this Caſe, the primary Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Method of Cure, are to be taken from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine; viz.</hi> We muſt uſe neither <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick</hi> not <hi>Cardiack</hi> Remedies, but either <hi>Emetick, Cathartick,</hi> or <hi>De-oppilative</hi> Medicines, and eſpecially <hi>Chalybeats.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is vitiated, yet its Indication utterly diſagreeth with the Affects of which the ſick Perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains. For Example, If any in a <hi>Coma,</hi> or a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> make Red <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> fill'd with Preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Contents, its Inſpection excellently ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts Coindications; to wit, that we uſe not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies too hot; but temperate. The principal
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0206400400:72"/>uſe of Water-Judgment, is, in obſerving the State and Progreſs of every Diſeaſe, as alſo the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Alterations towards Health or Death. For in Chronical Affects, where the Phyſician ſees the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> every Day, he may know, from hence, by what degrees the Diſeaſe or Sickneſs is every Day augmented; what time Purgatives or Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives will be moſt fit, and what other Medicaments will be moſt ſuitable: Hence may he obſerve, Whether Nature prevails over the Diſeaſe; or no; and hence may the moſt certain Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks be made, of the hope or danger of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; <hi>viz.</hi> how the Signs of Concoction or Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity appear in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines:</hi> Hence in Acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes may the ſtate and height of a <hi>Feaver</hi> be beſt fore-ſeen; at what time the Criſis, and with what Succeſs it may be hop'd for; when ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Evacuate, and when to give Reſtoratives and Cordials.</p>
               <p>Phyſicians ought to obſerve, with as much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and diligence, the <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi> for the fit Seaſon and moſt proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of adminiſtring Phyſick, as Mariners their Sea-compaſs, to ſteer their Courſe by. Let this which is already deliver'd, concerning <hi>Urine</hi>-judgment ſuffice, which is not a Collection from the empty Traditions of <hi>Mountebancks,</hi> but conſonant to right Reaſon and Truth. I know beſides, that <hi>Quacks</hi> and other bold Pretenders, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where ſcatter innumerable Rules and falſe Preceps of <hi>Water-propheſy,</hi> inſomuch that if they look but on the <hi>Urinal,</hi> they pretend, as if they could divine whether it be a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0206400400:73"/>that is ſick; how long the Patient has been ill; what Diſeaſe, he is ſick of; whether the Diſeaſe, will end in Life or Death; whether the Party, be Amorous or Sad; whether a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, be with Child or no; and if with Child, fore-tell whether Boy or Girle, and many other ridiculous Stories. In which, by uſing theſe empty Conjectures, and by their Confidence, they impoſe on Credulous Minds; or, what's more frequent with them, make private and ſubtle Inquiry other ways, into the State of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and then falſly aſcribe that Knowledge to the Inſpection of <hi>Urine.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Concerning the examination of <hi>Urines</hi> and the different manner of Trial.</head>
               <p>THO' commonly the Trial and Inſpection of <hi>Urine</hi> be but ſimple; <hi>viz.</hi> moſt <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> immediately after they have put the Water into a Glaſs, ſhake it and then forthwith paſs their Judgment: Yet the matter ſeems a little more intricate, to thoſe who har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſign the Well-fare and Health of the Sick. And concerning this Water-Inſpection, there are ſome obſervable Circumſtances, which if omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nothing certain, or that may be indeed a Directory in Practice, can be learnt from the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinal.</hi> Moreover in ſome Affects, beſides In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0206400400:74"/>of the Glaſs, there are other Methods of Trial, by which what is hidden and in the dark in relation to <hi>Urines,</hi> is made manifeſt; whence ſome, who endeavour'd a more accurate Water-judgement, have ſucceſsfully brought in faſhion, the Evaporation and artificial Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Urines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore we will briefly ſpeak of the right manner of <hi>Urine</hi>-inſpection, and in ſome Caſes, bow they may differently be reſolv'd into their firſt Principles.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Urine</hi> of the Sick Perſon is offer'd to the Phyſician, if it has ſtood ſometime before in the Glaſs, and if the Liquor be Tranſparent, the <hi>Nubecula</hi> form'd, and if the reſt of the Contents fall to the bottom, there's nothing further wanting, but that forthwith the Prognoſtick be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But if the Water be newly pour'd out into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal,</hi> or be before troubled by ſhaking together, you muſt ſtay till the confus'd parts be again ſeparated, and recover their due places of Settlement. But if the Liquor being fill'd with Contents, its Pores being ſhut up with cold, become Turbid and Muddy, let the Glaſs be kept in a hot place till the <hi>Urine</hi> clear again, and afterwards let it be plac'd for ſome time near the Fire, ſo long till the preternatural Contents, to wit, either the Thinner be re-imbib'd by the Pores, when enlarged by Heat, or the more Thick fall to the bottom: And if the Filaments which make the <hi>Urine</hi>-cloud (if there be any) be collected together in the Middle Region or a little beneath, then from hence 'twill appear,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0206400400:75"/>what's the Nature of, and what kind of predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy the Diſeaſe has; and likewiſe in <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> the degree of Heat and Effervency, the Concoction of the nutritive Juice, or its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation, as alſo the heaping up of Aduſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Blood, and its Separation begun or wholly fruſtrated, will alſo be ſomewhat more manifeſt by intimation from the <hi>Urine:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after this manner, muſt you proceed, when <hi>Urine</hi> is brought from far, whole Particles being greatly troubled by ſuch ſhaking, except they be kept ſometime in a hot Place, will not eaſily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their right Poſition. But if you Viſit the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent often at his own Houſe, 'twill be convenient that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> newly made be put into an Urinal and plac'd near ſome Heat, and while it leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grows hot, every Part without any Perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be diſpos'd of, after the beſt manner of Settlement.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Urine</hi> is thus nakedly, and as 'twere without its Vail preſented to the ſight, the next Caution is, leaſt that ſome of its <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> only accidentally contracted, and not properly belonging to it, impoſe upon the Phyſician, which is wont to happen ſometimes through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Alterations, proceeding from the Food that's eaten, of which this eſpecially conſiſts; and then the Colour and Scent are variouſly changed beyond Nature and the Phyſician's expectation. For indeed, there's an Error ſufficiently common, when the <hi>Urine,</hi> by <hi>Ruburb, Saffron</hi> or the Seed of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vender-Cotton</hi> and other things of the like Tincture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ingeſted by the Mouth, growing yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0206400400:76"/>and giving that dye to Linnen, is thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be an undoubted ſign of the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> Sometimes we likewiſe ſuppoſe, tho' falſely, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> ſhews a <hi>Feaveriſh</hi> Diſtemper when highly tinctur'd wirh a deep Red, by the broth of Peaſe, or a decoction of <hi>Madder,</hi> or other Liquids of the like nature.</p>
               <p>It often happens, that the high Colour of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> by a thin ſmall Liquor copiouſly drank, is abated; and by a ſtronger Drink and more hot Nouriſhment, is rais'd; which accidental Cauſes, except a Phyſician know, he is neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to paſs a falſe Judgment upon the bare ſight of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore, without any manifeſt Cauſe the Colour of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines</hi> is chang'd, the manner of Diet muſt be inquired into, ſo that when the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration proceeds from what's ingeſted, it may not raſhly be aſcrib'd to the Diſeaſe. A Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be rais'd here, Why ſince moſt things taken in at the Mouth, before they be tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Urine,</hi> wholly loſe their innate Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; there are yet ſome others, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten, bequeath ſuch a laſting Tincture to the <hi>Serum,</hi> that they run through the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all the paſſages without any alteration?</p>
               <p>The reaſon of which, is ſolely this: Some mixt Bodies have Particles of immutability of Colour, which make up their compoſition ſo ſubtile and exceeding volatile that theſe Bodies ingeſted, tho' in a 1ittle quantity, colour the whole maſs of <hi>Chyle,</hi> and then the Nutritive Juice, that's convey'd to the Blood, aſcends colour'd, and its vehicle, to wit,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0206400400:77"/>the ſerous Part, is ſent out always Tinctur'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis obvious to every one, who ſometimes ſmells his own, to know what Scent, ſound <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> have: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe when newly made, the <hi>Sulphureous,</hi> and <hi>Saline</hi> Particles are cloſely bound together in the Liquor, and then 'tis not very ingrate. But when it has ſtood ſometime, ſo that from the ſolution of the mixture, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> edg'd with <hi>Salt</hi> begins to exhale, it has a very noiſom ſtinking Scent. Beſides we may obſerve, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines</hi> new made ſometimes ſmell ſweet like <hi>Violets;</hi> and ſometimes ſmell very ſtrong and ſtinkingly.</p>
               <p>The firſt, depends neither upon a ſound nor unſound State of the Body; but is only produc'd by thoſe things that are ingeſted. <hi>Turpentine, Nutmegs</hi> and ſome other Aromaticks, tho' of a different Nature or Operation, taken inwardly give a ſweet ſcent equally alike to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this ſeems to be the reaſon: In ſuch like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, very many Particles of a purer <hi>Sulphur</hi> (that is, more Spirituous) have the Predominancy in the mixture, and tho' blended with the <hi>Serum,</hi> cannot be contain'd in it, but forthwith when the <hi>Urine</hi> is made, break their bond of mixture, and thoſe alone, not accompany'd with other ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particles of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> ſally forth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon diffuſe a Scent ſufficiently grateful, which tho' it be the reſult of different Ingeſtibles yet always ſmells Violet-like; becauſe all thoſe <hi>Sulphureous</hi> Particles are freed in Digeſtion from other adjuncts of the ſame concrete Body, neither are they infected with others from the <hi>Urine.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0206400400:78"/>
               <p>As for a very ingrate ſtinking <hi>Urine,</hi> that, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceeds from an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> about the Kidneys, Bladder, or Urinary Paſſages: Sometimes it likewiſe proceeds from a more than ordinary hot Diſtemperature of the Reins, or the whole Body; for when <hi>Sulphur</hi> is too deeply incocted in the <hi>Serum,</hi> its Particles being edg'd with thoſe of <hi>Salt</hi> (becauſe leſs cloſely combin'd) do forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with exhale, and very offenſively ſmite the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Smelling. Beſides, <hi>Urine</hi> ſometimes has its graveolent or ſtinking Scent, from what's eaten; for <hi>Garlicky Sparrowgraſs,</hi> the Balſom of <hi>Sulphur, Syder, Rheniſh</hi>-Wine and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ingeſtibles cauſe a ſtinking <hi>Urine.</hi> If the reaſon of theſe be requir'd, I anſwer, Thoſe things that cauſe a ſtinking Scent in <hi>Urine,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provoke it in a more plentiful manner; wherefore it appears and is hence demonſtrable, that the Aſſumption or taking of ſuch things, precipitates the Blood, and abundantly haſtens the emiſſion of the <hi>Serum,</hi> and when that, after this manner, is abruptly diſ-united from the Maſs of Blood, the compage of the Liquor is render'd looſe, neither are the parts exactly mix'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the compage of the <hi>Urine</hi> before 'tis ſent out of the Body, being thus loos'd and diſſolv'd, as ſoon as it is made, the more craſs and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous</hi> Particles (which are link'd together with <hi>Salt</hi>) do preſently exhale or breath forth, and ſo diffuſe a very ill S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent: For, the <hi>Urine</hi> that is thus alter'd by what is taken inwardly, ſeems very like a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> in which <hi>Antimony,</hi> or common <hi>Sulphur</hi> is boyl'd, and an Acid after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0206400400:79"/>inſtill'd; for in this Decoction, as alſo in ſuch an <hi>Urine,</hi> the compage of the Liquor being deſtroy'd, the Sulphureous little Bodies break forth and attaque the Organs of Senſation with a noiſome Savour.</p>
               <p>But if any curious Searcher of <hi>Urines,</hi> will go beyond the Trial of Sight and Smell, he may readily by ſeveral Operations, reſolve them into their ſeveral Parts, and at 'twere Anatomize them to the Life; and thence deduce Phyſical Directions of great Conſequence.</p>
               <p>For, in ſome Chronical Diſeaſes, where the ill Contemperaments of the Blood are exactly to be ſearch'd, that the Proportion and Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> in it, may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out, 'twill be convenient ſometimes to evaporate or diſtil the <hi>Urine;,</hi> as alſo ſomething may be learn'd by precipitating or ſeparating them by Putrifaction. I knew an honeſt Woman grievouſly afflicted with a perfect <hi>Lepra</hi> or ſcaly Deformity of her Skin, who uſually every Day ſcrap'd off a great quantity of Bran-like or Scaly Matter; her <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> being evaporated, left behind it a cruſty <hi>Salt</hi> Sediment, very much like that Excrement of the Skin, ſticking to the ſides of the Veſſel. Formerly I evaporated the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> of a Gentlewoman, who was greatly afflicted with Convulſive Motions, and diſtenſion of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; the quantity of the <hi>Saline</hi> and <hi>Tartarous</hi> Matter that remain'd in the bottom, did exceed the half of all the Liquor in weight. By theſe means it appears, we may eaſily find out the proportion of a <hi>Saline</hi> Principle in the Blood and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0206400400:80"/>Humours. Now whether that <hi>Salt</hi> is volatiliz'd or fix'd above meaſure, the Diſtillation of the <hi>Urine,</hi> will manifeſt. For if the <hi>Spirit</hi> (ſo call'd) be plentifully exhaled from the <hi>Urine,</hi> and if the <hi>Salt</hi> alſo aſcends in the Glaſs-Alembick, 'tis a viſible ſign of Volatilization; but if the contrary, it argues the fixation of the <hi>Salt.</hi> As the Evaporation and Diſtillation of <hi>Urine</hi> ſhews the power of a <hi>Saline</hi> Principle, ſo the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Putrefaction diſcover the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and more craſs Contents of <hi>Urines,</hi> as 'twere in Weight and Meaſure.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt, tho' the <hi>Urine</hi> be a Salt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and full of Contents, yet becauſe its <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> Particles, are not (as 'tis uſual in other <hi>Menſtruums</hi>) either wholly in a ſtate of Fixati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Fluidity, but for the moſt part Volatile, therefore 'tis not preſently precipitated by the pouring in of any thing that's Salt; the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and other Acids do nothing; the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> makes a little perturbation; but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of <hi>Allom</hi> in it (becauſe it very much binds its ſpaces) preſently and that very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the whole Liquor, forcing all the Contents of the Liquor or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> out of their places, and renders them viſible; whereupon by this means, without the tedious proceſs of ſettling, you may know how much <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and terrene Matter the Maſs of Blood, as its Dregs, imparts to the <hi>Serum.</hi> The putrefaction of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines</hi> is wont to exhibit every Particle of every kind, yet more diſtinct, and as 'twere ſeparately rang'd. For if the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> ſtand in a Glaſs unmov'd for many
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0206400400:81"/>Days, 'tis much alter'd in Colour, Scent and Conſiſtence; for the Colour is more intenſe and high, the Smell ingrate and very ſtinking, the Conſiſtence more thick, and very often it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in its ſurface a dark, and ſometimes a blackiſh-blew colour; as alſo a thick and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Sediment in the bottom of the Veſſel, and often a ſandy Cruſt on the ſides, or a whitiſh or Aſh-colour'd <hi>Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſuch <hi>Phaenomenons,</hi> ſince <hi>Urines</hi> putrify ſooner or later, and thereupon are more or leſs alter'd from their former State, we may gueſs, what is the proportion of <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and which predominates: Likewiſe a true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may hence be made, concerning the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Terrene or Earthy Matter.</p>

The cauſe of them, is a thick and viſcous Flegm, dryed and knit together in the Veins by heat, which in its long paſſage through the narrow Veins of the Kidneys and Ureters, is extended to ſo great a length.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Thin Sediment.</note>A Thin Sediment, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Diſeaſe, which in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Malady, thickens daily by Degrees, is good. For, it ſhews that Nature endeavour'd a Concoction at the beginning, and doth daily labour to bring its work to perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Thick Sediment.</note>A Thick Sediment, cauſed by thick and crude humors is very bad; for, as thoſe thick and crude humours are very hard to be o'recome by Nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do threaten much danger, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the ſtrength of the Body be decay'd; but if there be any ſtrength of Nature, they do only ſignifie a prolongation of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe crude and thick humors ſettling at the bottom of the Chamber-pot, may deceive a young Practitioner, who may perhaps think them to be a good and true Settlement; and therefore they are to be exactly diſtinguiſh'd.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, thoſe crude and thick humours u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually appear at the beginning of a Diſeaſe, but the good and true Settlement never till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0206400400:97"/>thereof. And it happens, that after the beginning of the Diſeaſe, that thick and crude Humour being attenuated, there appears no more ſettlement in the bottom, but only in the place thereof, a Cloud or Matter hanging in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or the <hi>Urine,</hi> which as the Concoction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds falls down daily from the upper part of the Chamber-pot, to the lower part; which is the true ſign of Concoction, when the Cloud changes into that Matter, (which hangs in the middle of the Pot) called <hi>Enaeorema,</hi> and that <hi>Eraeorema</hi> into the Sediment: but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when the Sediment changes into the <hi>Enaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rema</hi> or Cloud, that Settlement is not laudable, but a crude and thick humour which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attenuated by Concoction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This crude Humour doth not ſtick cloſe together, neither is it altogether ſmooth and equal: but the laudable Sediment is ſmooth, equal and moderately thick. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This crude Humour is heavier and reſides altogether to the bottom of the Chamber-pot; but a good Sediment doth not cloſe, but rather reſts in the bottom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little raiſed from it, and as it were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a kind of Globe, which the crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour doth not do, but remains a little more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and ſcattered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urines</hi> in malignant and Peſtilent <hi>Feavers</hi> in Subſtance, Colour and Contents like the <hi>Urine</hi> of found People, are pernicious. For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, Urines <hi>concocted ſuddenly and without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, are evil; and whatever appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the</hi> Urine, <hi>not Concocted according to Nature, is worſe.</hi>

                  <p>Si verò intermiſerit, atque interdum mingatur ſine Sedimento, &amp; aliqando habeat Sedimentum album, laeve &amp; aequale, morbum diuturnum, &amp; minùs ſecurum oſtendit.</p>
                  <p>Iterum idem in Coacis praenotionibus ſcribit. Urina bonum Sedimentum habens, quod derepente evaneſcit, laborem, mutationemque ſignificat.<hi>Item:</hi> Si Urina fuerit ſubrubra, &amp; Sedimentum ſubrubrum, ac laeve, diuturnior haec quidem eſt, quàm prior, valdè tamen ſalubris.</p>

               </q>
               <p>From hence it appears, That <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is beſt which hath its Sediment White, Smooth, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and doth alſo continue ſo all the while, till perfect Judgment be made of the Diſeaſe. This well concocted Matter, is a ſign of a ſpeedy <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> and perfect Recovery:</p>
               <p>But if it do intermit, and that ſometimes the Water be made without any Sediment, it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that the Diſeaſe will be longer and leſs ſafe. Again, that <hi>Urine</hi> which hath a good Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, if it ſuddenly diſappear, it fore-tells a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0206400400:99"/>great change, and that the Diſtemper will prove dangerous. Alſo if the <hi>Urine</hi> be ſomewhat Red with a Sediment of the ſame Colour and Smooth, ſuch indeed, is more continual than the former, yet greatly profitable and very healthful; <hi>i. e.</hi> it ſhews the Diſeaſe will be of long continuance, but free from danger. Thoſe which have a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in their <hi>Urines,</hi> within a few Days after their Illneſs, have Judgment ſoon made on the Diſeaſes; for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines</hi> concocted ſuddenly are judged very had.</p>
               <p>In a Word, as a good ſound <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> ought to be of a middling Subſtance, that is, neither too Thick nor too Thin, of a Citron-colour, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inclining to Red; and thoſe other differences that come neareſt to this, are to be accounted beſt: So likewiſe thoſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines,</hi> which in any degree, appear contrary, either in Subſtance or Colour, are to be adjudg'd naught; of both which, a right Prognoſtication may be made, by an Accurate <hi>Uroſcopia</hi> or diligent Inſpection of the <hi>Urine.</hi>
