            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Reflections contained in the following Pages, are the Reſult of an Enquiry to which my Duty led me, wherein the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0575600500:3"/>
of an Alteration is ſuggeſted in a Branch of the Statute-Laws of great Importance to the internal Intereſts of this Nation; and a Propoſal for an Amendment of thoſe Laws, is humbly ſubmitted to that Authority, in which alone the Power of enacting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing Statutes reſides.</p>
            <p>It is not in Behalf of a Book, but as the Advocate of the induſtrious Poor, the Sinews, the Muſcles of the Body politic, and as the Friend of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Manufactures, the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and laudable Means of national Greatneſs, that I preſume to addreſs your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>The Relation which your Lordſhip, by an Office of great Truſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, bears to a County, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0575600500:4"/>
any invidious Compariſon, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to none in the Kingdom for Wealth and Grandeur, and which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Reſidence of his Majeſty and the Royal Family, had afforded a plauſible Excuſe for this Trouble; but the Conſideration of that Benevolence and Zeal for the Intereſts of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which you have exerted in many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, too recent to be forgotten, left no Room to doubt but that any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for its Service would be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably received.</p>
            <p>Permit me therefore, my Lord, ſo far only as it ſhall ſeem likely to produce any Benefit to the Public, to intreat your Lordſhip's Protection for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propoſal; as I am firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that if it meets with Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <p>THE Bill to which the following Obſervations are an Introduction conſiſts,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of thoſe Clauſes in the ſeveral Acts of Parliament now in Force which have been found moſt uſeful, with ſome few Variations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of ſuch new Clauſes as ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for anſwering the Ends now propoſed: Theſe latter are printed in a different Character from the Reſt of the Bill, and are recommended to the Conſideration, in the approaching Receſs of Parliament, of thoſe Members of either Houſe, who whether in Buſineſs or Retirement are equally ſolicitous to promote the public Good, and who knowing that the Meaning and Operation of legal Language is one of the moſt evaneſcent Subjects that the human Mind is converſant with, will employ their Talents in detecting any of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formal Expreſſions which often defeat the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the beſt intended Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0575600500:7"/>
The general Form of the <hi>BILL</hi> was ſuggeſted by a caſual View of an anonymous Pamphlet, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed almoſt Thirty Years ago, under the Title of <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A Scheme for reducing all the Laws relating to the common Highways into one Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;"</q> and ſaid in the Preface to have been written by a Gentleman in the Commiſſion of the Peace, who had made the Amendment of the Highways his principal Care for many Years. But this Scheme conſiſting merely of a Draught of a Bill for that Purpoſe, not very artificial in its Conſtruction, very little Aſſiſtance could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from it more than regarded the Selection and Arrangement of the Clauſes in former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, proper to be retained in any future Law; and as not only the Method of impoſing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning the Statute-Duty, now recommended, is widely different from that Author's, but every Section contained in his Scheme has been both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and ſubſtantially varied, and the Preamble, and almoſt every one of the additional Clauſes new drawn, the Author of the preſent Publication fears he has made himſelf anſwerable for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be found amiſs in the Bill as it now ſtands.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, in eſtimating the Price of a Day's Labour at one Shilling and Six-pence, he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the uſual Rate; if this ſhould be the Caſe, let it be remembred that he had an Eye to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0575600500:8"/>
Counties adjacent to the Metropolis, and that any other Eſtimation, tho' it may occaſion ſome ſmall Alteration in the Penalties, will not affect the general Reaſoning contained in the Propoſal.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be thought eligible, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſons within given to the contrary, to annihilate the Statute-Duty, the Bill may be eaſily adapted to that End: But this the Public may be aſſured of, that every Attempt to amend the Highway-Laws by additional or explanatory Acts, will produce great Confuſion among thoſe whoſe Duty it is to execute them; and that nothing can remedy the Evils at preſent complained of, but the Conſolidation into one Act of the moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Clauſes contained in thoſe now ſubſiſting.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE Attention of the Public, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it has been engaged by an Object of the utmoſt Importance, has of late Years been employed to a very extraordinary Degree in the Repair and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Public Roads in this and the neighbouring Kingdom. Perſons of all Ranks and Profeſſions, the Philoſopher and the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, have, with a laudable Emulation, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who ſhould moſt promote the Intereſt of this Country, by facilitating the Methods of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Produce from one End to the other.</p>
            <p>Nor is this to be looked upon as any other than a particular Mode of that Benevolence,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0575600500:10"/>
which, if we do not greatly flatter ourſelves, is at preſent the diſtinguiſhing Characteriſtic of the Inhabitants of this Iſland; a Principle which we have beheld operating in various Ways, and which even now, ſeeks and ſolicits Occaſion for its Exertion.</p>
            <p>A Diſpoſition more favourable to any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal calculated either to remove a public Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or produce any poſitive Good, is not to be wiſhed for; and it is hoped, that that contained in the following Pages may be thought to have a Tendency to promote one or other of thoſe Ends.</p>
            <p>It is too obvious to need inſiſting on, that very little of the Concern which has of late been ſhewn about the Roads in general, has been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to thoſe which lead from Pariſh to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and are not the ordinary Channel of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to Cities and Towns of great Trade. The Invention of Turnpikes is manifeſtly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for great Roads; which, as they are made in Favour of Commerce, produce a Revenue ſufficient to keep them in Repair; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have been left to the Care of the Surveyors of the Highways in their reſpective Pariſhes, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Direction and Controul of the Juſtices of Peace, whoſe Authority in this Branch of their Juriſdiction is of ſuch a Nature, that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Appearance of great Oppreſſion, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0575600500:11"/>
can ſeldom be exerted to any beneficial Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>In what Manner, and by whom, the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways were anciently repaired, does not at this Time clearly appear: it is probable, that while the Feudal Law ſubſiſted in its greateſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and the Number of Vaſſals was greater than it has been at any Time ſince the Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Manufactures and Commerce amongſt us, that the baſer Tenures, particularly that of Villenage, might oblige the inferior Claſs of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this Duty; and this Opinion ſeems to be warranted by a Paſſage of an Author of very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Authority, whereby it appears, that the Judges had in Charge to enquire, among other Things, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"of common Highways deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or otherwiſe in bad Repair, who is bound to repair and amend them; and ſuch as are preſented ſhall be attached by perſonal Diſtreſs to appear; and if it be found on their Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Court, that they hold certain Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the King upon Condition that they repair ſuch Way, the ſaid Tenements are to be ſeiſed into the King's Hands, and the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs are to anſwer for the Iſſues, and to cauſe the Repairs to be done: and where there is no Tenement held of the King by the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch Perſons as are bound to repair the Ways, and have not diſcharged their Duty, are to be in the King's Mercy; and the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff

            <p>The Statute of <hi>Winton,</hi> 13 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. ſeems to have been made but in Affirmance of this Law, for thereby the Lord is <q rend="inline margQuotes">"to abate certain Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances in the Highways leading from one Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Town to another, or be fined at the King's Pleaſure; he is alſo to fell the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods in ſuch Highways, and for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to have the Aid of the Country.</q>

            <p>The Statute above cited was to continue in Force for Seven Years, but being ſuffered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it was revived by 5 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 13. and by 29 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. it was made perpetual.</p>
            <p>There is great reaſon to think that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the Law fell very far ſhort of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Ends propoſed by them, ſince we find that the Repair of Bridges, Cauſways, and Highways, even after the Time of <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> was deemed a laudable Exertion of public Spirit. <hi>Sutton,</hi> the Founder of the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed by his Will great Sums for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of this Sort. The Teſtaments of wealthy People, who died before the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, afford many other Examples of the like Nature; and many Corporations are Feoffees of Lands charged with the perpetual Repair of public Roads in different Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that the Beneficence of this Nation, has, at ſucceſſive Periods, been directed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0575600500:16"/>
to very different Objects. The Building of Churches, and the Endowment of Monaſteries, were the firſt Inſtances of public Charity of which we have any Memorials. The Diſſolution of Religious Houſes, and the Reformation which immediately followed, furniſhed Motives to the Erection of Seminaries for Learning. To this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Foundation and Endowment of Alms-Houſes, after that the Building of Charity Schools, and laſt of all Hoſpitals; ſo that for this Reaſon, and perhaps, becauſe the Law has taken them under its Care, we now ſeldom hear of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Donations for repairing the Highways.</p>
            <p>We ſee that by the Statute of <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> the Perſons bound to contribute, either by Labour or in Money to the Amendment of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are divided into two Claſſes; the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſiſts of</p>
            <p>Such as occupy a Ploughland in Tillage or Paſture within the Pariſh, and</p>
            <p>Every other Perſon keeping there a Draught or Plough.</p>
            <p>Theſe are to ſend, at every Day and Place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, one Wain or Cart, with Oxen, Horſes, or other Cattle, and two Men, on Pain of every Draught making Default, 10<hi>s.</hi>

The ſecond Claſs conſiſts of</p>
            <p>Every Houſholder, Cottager, and Labourer, able to labour, and being no hired Servant by the year, who are required by themſelves, or one ſufficient Labourer for every of them, on every of the ſaid Days, to work in the Amendment of the Highways, upon Pain to loſe for every Day 12<hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may obſerve every Individual in the Kingdom, from the yearly hired Servant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is required to contribute to this neceſſary Work; and that thoſe Land-Holders, who, by occupying leſs than a Ploughland, and keeping no Draught or Plough, are not comprehended within the firſt deſcriptive Clauſe, are yet reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſecond; and we may very reaſonably infer, that had there been, at the Time of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Statute, as there is now, any Rank of Men equally capable in reſpect of their Wealth, of contributing to the Amendment of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with thoſe deſcribed by the firſt Clauſe, and yet not included in it; that in that Caſe the Legiſlature would, by a few Words, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that Clauſe to them, and not tacitly have ranked ſuch Perſons with Houſholders, Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Labourers able to labour.</p>

It is true, that even at the Time of making this Statute, it was not univerſally agreed what Quantity of Land a Ploughland contained, and that the Antiquaries and Lawyers entertained different Opinions about that Matter. My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> has ſaid, that a Carve or Hide of Land, or a Ploughland, which is all one, is not of any certain Content, but ſo much as one Plough may plough in one Year; and ſo in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries it is more, and in others leſs, according to the Heavineſs of the Soil. 9 <hi>Coke's Rep.</hi> 124. <hi>Lowe's Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others aſſert a Difference between a Hide and a Carve or Ploughland; for they ſay, that a Hide of Land contains four Ploughlands, or 480 Acres; whereas a Carve or Ploughland contains but 120 Acres, or four Yardlands of thirty Acres each: others again maintain a Carve or Ploughland to be an indefinite Meaſure, <hi>quantum aratrum arare poteſt in oeſtivo tempore.</hi> Vide <hi>Skene, Minſheu,</hi> and <hi>Norden's Surveiour's Dialogue.</hi> However, this Controverſy is now at an End, the Statute of 7 <hi>Will.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. having ſettled that 50<hi>l.</hi> a Year ſhall be deemed a Ploughland.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtood the Law till the Time of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the 5th, 18th, and 39th of whoſe Reign three ſeveral Statutes were made for the Repair of Highways. By that of the 5th, <hi>cap.</hi>

Indeed one of theſe Statutes, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the 18th of the Queen, <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. enacts, that every Perſon (except ſuch as dwell in <hi>London</hi>) that ſhall be aſſeſſed to any Subſidy, to 5<hi>l.</hi> in Goods, or 40<hi>s.</hi> in Land or above, being none of the Parties chargeable for the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Highways by any former Law, but as a Cottager, ſhall find two able Men yearly to labour in the Highways at ſuch Times as by the ſaid Statute are appointed.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0575600500:20"/>
Method of raiſing Money by Subſidy is diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, is Matter of Queſtion.</p>
            <p>But afterwards, upon Conſideration, it was found, that in many Places of the Kingdom there was no Uſe for Carts and Teams, but that the Practice was to carry Materials on Horſes Backs, or by other Kinds of Carriage; it is therefore by 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8. enacted,</p>
            <p>That in ſuch Places the Inhabitants ſhall ſend in ſuch their Horſes as are accuſtomed to that Labour, and their other Carriages as by any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Statute is appointed for Carts.</p>

a Poſſibility that a Coach, Chariot, or Poſt-Chaiſe and two Horſes, might be deemed a Draught, yet that they ſhould ever be reckoned a Team, no one can imagine.</p>

            <p>Upon a very tranſient Retroſpect to the Laws above cited, we ſhall ſee that the Legiſlature ſeem to have thought it juſt, that the Burthen of repairing the Highways ſhould be borne by the ſeveral Claſſes of People into which it had arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, in Proportion to their reſpective Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and the Uſe they might each of them be ſuppoſed to make of the Highways. And inaſmuch as theſe Laws are not in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, which, as ſome fanciful Legiſts have aſſerted, execute themſelves, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to appoint proper Officers, whoſe Duty ſhould be in general to take Care of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0575600500:27"/>
and ſee that the ſeveral Laws enacted for their Preſervation and Amendment from Time to Time were complied with. And with regard to the Manner in which theſe Laws are executed, we alſo find, that in purſuance of the Authority given them by the Statutes above-mentioned, particularly that of 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Will. &amp; Mar.</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Pariſh Officers and Inhabitants of every Pariſh throughout the Kingdom, do yearly at the ſtated Time for that Purpoſe, make Returns of a complete Number of Inhabitants qualified as the Act directs, to the Juſtices in their Seſſions, who thereout do, by their Warrant, appoint the Surveyors of every Pariſh within their reſpective Diviſions.—That the Money remaining in the Hands of their Predeceſſors is paid over to the new Surveyors.—That ſome Time in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer a general Notice is publiſhed in the Pariſh Church, of the Six Days on which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are required to work on the Highways.—That on thoſe Days ſome attend, and others make Default.—That about St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Day in every Year a Return is made of the Defaulters to the Juſtices, who, if no Cauſe is aſſigned on a Summons iſſued by them for that Purpoſe, execute Diſtreſs Warrants, upon which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Penalties are levied; which it is ſuppoſed are applied in hiring Perſons to do that Labour, which the Law in the firſt Inſtance impoſes on the Defaulters themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0575600500:28"/>
Before we proceed to point out the various Ways by which the ſalutary Purpoſes of the Legiſlature may be, and are defeated; it will be neceſſary to enquire how far the Laws now under Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration do at this Day conſiſt with that Juſtice and Equality with a View to which they were originally framed. The intelligent Reader need not be told, that the frequent Uſe, if not the Invention of Coaches, and all thoſe various Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Wheel-Carriage, the ſole End whereof is the Conveyance of Perſons from one Place to another, is of far leſs Antiquity than the firſt of the Statutes above cited; and it is far from being Matter of abſolute certainty, that a Cart drawn by <hi>two</hi> Horſes only, is in Conſtruction of Law a Draught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dalton,</hi> who wrote before the Year 1619, ſeems to make it a Queſtion whether it is or no, when he ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I find that a Draught for the King's Carriages heretofore hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with two Horſes, as it ſeemeth by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 21."</q> (The Words of the Statute be <q rend="inline margQuotes">"No Sheriffe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall take the Horſes or Carts of any Perſon for Carriage, except he pay for one Cart with two Horſes Ten-pence by the Day, and for a Cart with three Horſes Fourteen-pence by the Day); and therefore I think him that uſually goeth to Cart for his own Buſineſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0575600500:29"/>
with two Horſes, to be chargeable to find a Cart and two Horſes for the Amending of the Highways, and to carry ſuch Loads as his two Horſes are well able to draw."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee the Author above quoted driven to the Neceſſity of reaſoning from Analogy, in Order to ſhew that a Cart which is conſtantly uſed for the Purpoſes of Huſbandry, and was an Implement in uſe ſo long ago as <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> if drawn but with two Horſes, is a Draught within the Meaning of the Statute of <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> and after all, his Opinion does not ſeem (as ſome others of his have) to have been adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any ſubſequent Statute, or eſtabliſhed by any Judicial Determination.</p>
            <p>If this then is the Caſe in the Inſtance above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, what are we to think of that of <hi>Coaches, Chariots,</hi> and <hi>Poſt-Chaiſes,</hi> which have no Relation to Agriculture or Huſbandry, and were ſcarcely known at the Time of making the Statute? Or indeed, if we conſider that the Occupiers of ſuch Carriages are, throughout the Kingdom, exempted from the greater Statute-Duty, what can we think, but that there is no Law in Being, which, in reſpect to the Statute-Labour required of each of them, does diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the higheſt and loweſt Rank of Subjects?</p>
            <p>

It has indeed been aſſerted, though on very ſlender Authority, that this Matter did once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Determination of Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> whoſe Opinion is ſaid to have been, that Coaches and Chariots were included under the Appellation of a Draught, and that ſuch as kept them were liable to do Statute-Duty in like Manner as thoſe who kept Teams: but we have no authentic Report of any ſuch Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; and the Practice throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is to conſider ſuch Perſons merely as Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Propoſitions ſo evident, that they are incapable of Demonſtration; for which Reaſon it is ſufficient to ſay, that as the Law now ſtands, a Nobleman of the higheſt Rank that does not occupy 50<hi>l.</hi> a Year in Land, or keep a Team, (and there are many who do neither) and who is continually wearing the Highways with his Horſes and his Carriages, is legally chargeable with Six Days Labour in a Year, or the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nine Shillings in Lieu thereof; and that the poor Day-Labourer, the Cottager, who has a Wife, and perhaps three or four Infant Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to feed and clothe, whoſe only uſe of the public Highway is the walking on it to and from his daily Labour, is chargeable preciſely to the ſame Amount.</p>

My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſomewhere obſerves, that thoſe Laws which impoſe a Penalty diſproportionate to the Offence, are very ſeldom executed; and the Reaſon is, that in all ſuch Caſes, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Humanity both of thoſe that ſhould inform, and thoſe that ſhould convict, interpoſes; and ſo the Offender eſcapes with Impunity. The ſame may be ſaid of every Law that ſeems to be either unneceſſarily or inadequately ſevere; and to apply this Obſervation to the Caſe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we find that the lower Claſs of thoſe who are charged with Six Days manual Labour, from a Senſe of the Hardſhip of ſuch a Burthen, either do it partially, or not at all; and in the latter Caſe, being Contuments, they are liable to the Penalties, and ſo become amenable to the Juſtices for their Neglect.</p>
            <p>The Power of the Juſtices in mitigating the Severity of the Law, is reſtrained to very few Caſes; the <hi>reaſonable Excuſe</hi> which the Statutes of 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. and 1 <hi>Geo. cap.</hi> 52. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. allow, cannot operate in the Caſe of a Perſon whom the Law has expreſsly charged, and ſuch as are unable to labour are ſpecifically diſcharged. To whom then are the Juſtices to extend this their Clemency? perhaps after all, to thoſe few Perſons only, whoſe ſhort Reſidence in a Pariſh would make it unreaſonable to charge them with any Statute-Duty. If then the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0575600500:32"/>
are bound to iſſue their Warrant againſt every poor Defaulter for the whole of the Nine Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and if every Commutation or Compoſition be, as undoubtedly it is, illegal; let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how reluctantly this Power muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be executed, and how much it is the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of every poor Man, rather than conform to the Law to diſobey it, and truſt to all the Chances in his Favour that it will never be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted againſt him.</p>
            <p>With all due Deference, therefore, to the Wiſdom of thoſe concerned in framing them, we may venture to aſſert, that the Laws now under Conſideration, are at this Day, at leaſt, inconſiſtent with thoſe general Principles of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Equity, from which every Law in the Eſtimation of good Men, is ſuppoſed to derive its Authority.</p>
            <p>Nor does the Statute of <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> appear at all more defenſible, if we conſider it in a <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> View: A Law without a Sanction is but a dead Letter, and ſuch does that appear to be, which we are now conſidering. Suppoſe a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is required by the Statute, as occupying a Ploughland, or keeping a Draught, to ſend a Team to work Six Days on the Highways, and that he is averſe to the Performance of this Duty, what is the legal Motive to Obedience in this Caſe? The Anſwer is, the Fear of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0575600500:33"/>
the Penalty; but perhaps it may be more his Intereſt to incur the Penalty, than to avoid it. Let us conſider whether it is or not.</p>
            <p>The Labour of a Cart, a Team, and one Man, is in moſt Places eſtimated at Ten Shillings a Day; If the Farmer lets them out to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Gentleman, they will earn the Owner that Money; but if he ſends his Cart and Team with two Men to work on the Highways, the Labour of them all will excuſe him from the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of no larger a Sum: ſo that if he lets out his Team and incurs the Forfeiture, he ſaves the Labour of one Man, and the Statute is ſo far from being penal in this Reſpect, that it is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a Motive to Diſobedience; and this is certain, that no Man will ever ſend his Cart and Team to Highway-work, if he can either let them out or find Employment for them at Home.</p>
            <p>In like Manner may the Day-Labourer argue with himſelf, and conclude, that if he muſt either actually perform, or forfeit the Price of Six Days Labour, the latter is as eligible as the former; with this Difference, that if he does his Work, it is a certain Loſs to his Family of a whole Week's Subſiſtence; whereas, if he omits it, the Payment of the Penalty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0575600500:34"/>
This Defect, it muſt however be confeſſed, is owing ſolely to the Diminution in the Value of Money ſince the enacting the Statute now under Conſideration. Biſhop <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon Pretioſum, cap.</hi> V. has ſhewn, that in 1514. which was not a great many Years before this Statute was made, the Wages of a Labourer from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> except in Harveſt, were Four-pence; and from <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> to <hi>Eaſter,</hi> Three-pence by the Day: and though he has not mentioned it expreſly, we may there find Reaſons to conclude, that the Labour of a Waggon and Team with two Men, was worth about Two Shillings and Eight-pence by the Day. And by the Statute it appears, that at that Time, as it is now, the Penalty for every Day's Default of thoſe who were to ſend a Team, was Ten Shillings, and of thoſe who were to labour, One Shilling: now, if we compare theſe Forfeitures with the reſpective Duties they were intended to enforce, we ſhall find them to have been penal to a ſufficient Degree at the Time of making the Statute; but the Caſe is otherwiſe at preſent.</p>
            <p>It has been urged, that whether the Perſon charged does actually perform, or pay the Price of his Duty, the Caſe is the ſame to the Public; inaſmuch as the Forfeiture will purchaſe juſt as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0575600500:35"/>
much Labour and Aſſiſtance as was originally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him; and if that is done, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Public what Hands were employed in it.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this, it may be ſaid, that it ſeems as if the Makers of the Statute thought otherwiſe when they made the Penalty in both Caſes more than treble the Value of the Duty required. Beſides, is it of no Conſequence to a State whether the Laws are obeyed or not? we all know, that the increaſe of penal Laws is one of the moſt inflaming Topics of popular Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and that every additional Statute of that Sort, is an Addition to the Power of factious and deſigning Men to diſtreſs a Government. Is it not, therefore, of ſome Importance to the State whether a Law, which has ſolely the public Good for its Object, is conſtantly to wear the Face of a remedial or a penal one?</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee in what Manner the Law at preſent under Conſideration is obſerved in thoſe few Pariſhes, where the Inhabitants are diſpoſed to yield Obedience to the Letter of it; the Days for performing the Statute-Duty are ſo far from being conſidered as Days of Labour, that as well the Farmers as the common Day-Labourers, have long been uſed to look on them as Holidays, as a kind of Receſs from their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0575600500:36"/>
Labour, and devoted to Idleneſs and its concomitant Indulgences of Riot and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Beſides, as this Labour, where it is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may in ſome Degree be ſaid to be voluntary, we are not to wonder, if ſuch as employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it are leſs obedient to the Directions of thoſe whom the Law has appointed to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, than is conſiſtent with the due Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Duty. What is the Benefit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the Labour of twenty Men and as many Horſes, occupied in four or five different Stations within an extenſive Pariſh, compared with that of half the Number of each, working under the immediate Direction of an Officer, and executing a Plan which he himſelf has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed and ſees the Tendency and Advantages of?</p>
            <p>And this naturally leads us to reflect a little how inadequate in reſpect of its Duration, is the Authority of the Surveyors, to the Ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Inſtitution of the Office: we will ſuppoſe a Surveyor to be, as the Statute of <hi>Will. &amp; Mar.</hi> requires, a Man of Subſtance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to execute the Office faithfully; and that he is what no Statute can make him, a Judge of Roads, and the Art of making and repairing them: whatever Schemes he ſhall form on his taking on him the Office, he has in Effect but Six Days to execute; we muſt therefore ſuppoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0575600500:37"/>
that he will hardly think of any Repairs, Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or Amendments, but what may be done in that Time, by ſuch of the Inhabitants as have uſually preferred the doing their Statute-Duty to paying the Forfeiture. Beſides this inevitable Reſtraint on the Officer in reſpect to the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Operations, we ſee he can have no Dependence on thoſe who ſhould execute them; and in Caſe they ſhould fail to aſſiſt, he, as will be immediately ſhewn, is deſtitute of a Reſource. For,</p>
            <p>Suppoſe him deſirous of mending a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Way, and that, in Purſuance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the Statute of 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and with a View of getting it done before Harveſt, on the firſt Day of <hi>May,</hi> which is as ſoon as in many Places the Falling of the Waters will permit the Digging of Gravel, he gives Notice in the Church of the Six Days, and requires the Inhabitants to do their Statute-Work; and ſuppoſe alſo, that all thoſe whom he expects to attend do not come in; and that, in Favour of his Neighbours, he repeats this Notice, indulging them with further Time, and that after all they make Default, what is to become of the intended Repair, and how is the Way to be amended?</p>
            <p>Why, it will perhaps be ſaid, Let the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor apply the Forfeitures incurred by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0575600500:38"/>
Defaults in the Hire of Teams and Men, and go on with his Work; very true, but firſt he is to receive them; in Order to which he is to enter upon a new Work; namely, to bring the Defaulters to Juſtice. And firſt he is to make out a Liſt of their Names, which when completed, is to be returned to the Seſſions, which may poſſibly be to be held either in a Week or in four Months after the Offence; the Juſtices upon this Return, of Courſe iſſue Summonſes for the Defaulters to ſhew Cauſe in a reaſonable Time, why they will not pay; after this, if they do not comply, Diſtreſs-Warrants are iſſued, before the Execution whereof the wet Weather ſets in, and there is an End of Road-Work for that Year. The Surveyor is then buſied in making up his Account againſt the <hi>January</hi> Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or perhaps in defending Actions grounded on ſome Irregularity in the Notice, the due Publication whereof, or of the reſpective De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, not one in Fifty of them is ever prepared to prove: when <hi>January</hi> comes, his Account is paſſed, and he pays the Balance to the new Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor, who will have juſt the ſame Difficulties to encounter as his Predeceſſor.</p>
            <p>And yet, perhaps, the worſt Conſequences are behind; every one knows, that the Law in general requires, that the Highways through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom ſhall be kept in Repair by the ſeveral Pariſhes of which they are Part. The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0575600500:39"/>
Law has eſtabliſhed a Form of Proceeding by Way of Indictment againſt the Pariſhioners, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, if the Defendants are found guilty, they ſhall not be diſcharged by ſubmitting to a Fine, but a <hi>Diſtringas</hi> ſhall go <hi>in Infinitum</hi> till they repair. This Remedy may ſeem to have been founded on the Statute of <hi>Winton;</hi> yet by the Paſſage above quoted from <hi>Britton,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been Part of the antient Common Law of the Realm, of which the Statute is but a Recognition.</p>
            <p>The Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8, 9. has preſcribed another Method of Proceeding, which, though ſeemingly different, is in Effect much the ſame as that of an Indictment, which is by a Preſentment of the Surveyors to the next Juſtice, who is to certify the ſame at the next General Seſſions, and the Seſſions is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to enquire of the Defaulters. Now, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſeeming Efficacy of the Word <hi>immediately,</hi> yet the general Opinion on that Clauſe of the Statute is, that the Certificate of the Juſtice in this Caſe, has not the Effect of a Preſentment, but muſt be turned into an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; to which, by the Rules of Law, the Offender may enter his Traverſe, and no Trial can be had, till the Seſſions after.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe Methods of Proceeding ſeems liable to great Objection; for as to the firſt, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0575600500:40"/>
Law does not diſtinguiſh thoſe who have done, from thoſe who have refuſed to do their Statute Work, but pronounces its Judgment indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately againſt the whole Pariſh; from whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows this apparent Injuſtice, that the Innocent and the Guilty are involved in the ſame Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>As to the Method of proceeding by Preſentment under the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> we ſhall ſoon ſee that it is not productive of that expeditious Juſtice which the Statute gives Reaſon to expect; for ſuppoſe twenty or thirty perſons are required to work on the Highways the Week after <hi>Eaſter</hi> Seſſions, and that they make Default, or refuſe to work when they are out, the Surveyor in ſuch Caſe is by the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to preſent the Defaulters to the next Juſtice of the Peace, who is to certify this Preſentment to the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quarter-Seſſions of the Peace, that is the Summer Seſſions following, when we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Defaulters are indicted; now, if it ſhould be <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Seſſions before this Indictment can be tried, and ſooner it cannot well be, here is a whole Summer loſt, and nothing is done to the Repair of the Highways: for, from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Proſecution is commenced, a total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is ſure to follow, and there is an End of all legal Obedience; and if any Miſtake in the Manner of conducting it, or any Defect of Proof ſhould occaſion a Failure, the Offenders are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0575600500:41"/>
ſuppoſed to have triumphed over the Law, and it is odds if they ever after do any Duty.</p>
            <p>The Delay and Expence of theſe Methods of proceeding are Objections common to them both, and it is moſt ardently to be wiſhed, that as well for theſe Reaſons, as becauſe of their Inefficacy, they were either totally aboliſhed, or ſo regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to be more effectual.</p>
            <p>And here it may be proper to take Notice of the Difficulty that the Juſtices are under, with reſpect to the Meaſure of their Authority in the Caſe of Non performance of the Statute-Duty; for though it has been ſaid, that by the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Surveyors are to preſent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulters to the next Juſtice, who is to certify the Preſentment to the Seſſions, yet the ſubſequent Statute of 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. requires the Juſtice on the Oath of one Witneſs to levy the Penalties of 10<hi>s.</hi> and 1<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, <hi>ſect.</hi> 12 of the ſame Statute directs the ſame Method of Proceeding at the Seſſions as is preſcribed by the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Statute of 3 <hi>Will. &amp; Mar. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. enacts, that all Offences and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects reſpecting the publick Roads be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Surveyor on Oath to ſome Juſtice of the Peace within the Diviſion: but the Act does not direct what is to be done with the Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0575600500:42"/>
nor can any one conclude that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is to certify it, unleſs from the Second Section of the Statute, which enacts, that all the former Laws relating to the Highways ſhall be executed according to the Tenor of thoſe Laws.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the Statute of 1 <hi>Geo. cap.</hi> 52. is ſo worded, that it ſeems doubtful whether all the Authority given by former Acts, as to theſe Matters, is not taken away, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction veſted in the Special Seſſions.</p>
            <p>There is an Inconvenience that attends the Diſcharge of the Surveyor's Office, different from thoſe already enumerated; for, whereas they are ſuppoſed to ariſe from Diſobedience to the Law, this is the Conſequence of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with it. The Statutes direct, that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notice be publiſhed in every Pariſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Inhabitants to come in and perform their Statute-Work on the Six ſeveral Days mentioned in ſuch Notice; ſuppoſe then that they all attend and declare their Readineſs to Work, how are the Surveyors to employ them? In moſt Places the getting ready the Materials is a Step neceſſarily previous to working in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of the Highways; Gravel muſt be dug be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be ſpread; and till that is done, not only Teams, but more than a few Hands are of no Uſe; and the Surveyor, by calling out the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0575600500:43"/>
whole Pariſh at once, puts himſelf in the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Situation of a Magician, who, according to the vulgar Notion, having raiſed a Spirit whom he cannot employ, is immediately in his Power, and in Danger of being torn in Pieces. There are a few Inſtances of local Statutes obtained on the Application of particular Pariſhes, whereby the Labour is converted into a Rate; and this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, if it were univerſally practiſed, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly take away this and many other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Law as it now ſtands: but as all the Acts of Parliament ſince that of <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> have proceeded to enforce the Statute-Duty, and as none of the many various Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals for amending the Highways, which have from Time to Time been ſubmitted to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, have ventured to aſſert the Expediency of annihilating that Duty, we may very juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Reaſons in Favour of it lie deeper than is generally thought; and it would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be great Preſumption in any private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, that the ſame Advantages are to be expected from any Rate or Aſſeſſment, as are capable of being produced by a juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Apportionment of the Statute-Duty.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Duty of the Surveyor; it has hitherto been admitted, that he is what every one would wiſh him to be, a ſkillful Man in the Buſineſs of Road-making; but what muſt be the Conſequence if we ſuppoſe him to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0575600500:44"/>
be otherwiſe? A Farmer, or if he is an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of a Town, a Tradeſman, as ignorant of this kind of Buſineſs as Ninety nine Men in every Hundred throughout the Kingdom are found to be, what bleſſed Effects are like to follow from a Conteſt between Ignorance armed with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on the one Side, and invincible Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, to call it perhaps by a worſe Name than it deſerves, on the other!</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome, and but a few of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that attend the Execution of the Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's Office; but what are theſe, compared to thoſe of the Magiſtrates, who are to execute the Law in this Reſpect, as it now ſeems to ſtand? Imagine a Hundred or more of the moſt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Inhabitants of a Pariſh attending to aſſign Reaſons for not doing what in natural Juſtice they ought never to have been required to do. Imagine theſe Reaſons to be Poverty, a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family, a Wife, and four, five, or more ſmall Children; Sickneſs, Lameneſs, and an Income of Nine Shillings a Week to provide for them all Food, Raiment, and other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and think whether that Authority is to be envied, which the Magiſtrates are ſworn to exert in the enforcing Obedience to perhaps one of the moſt oppreſſive Statutes that ever yet received the Sanction of public Aſſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0575600500:45"/>
In the Courſe of the above Reflections it has been aſſumed, that the Surveyors are in general diſpoſed to purſue the Directions of the Law in the Execution of their Office; but in Truth it is very ſeldom that they do ſo: one Error into which they almoſt univerſally run, is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the reſpective Forfeitures for every Day's Default as a <hi>Tax</hi> or <hi>Rate,</hi> than which nothing can be more abſurd; in Conſequence whereof their Practice is, as ſoon as they enter into their Office to aſſeſs <hi>ex Officio</hi> every Inhabitant in a Sum proportionable to the Labour required of him, which they proceed to collect with as little He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation as the proper Officers do the Poor's Rate; whereas it is evident, that theſe ſeveral Sums are not due till the Perſons on whom they are charged have made Default. And this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror naturally induces a general Inattention to the Manner of publiſhing the Notice, which they ſuppoſe is to operate againſt only a few, and therefore is but little more than Matter of Form.</p>
            <p>There are two Miſchiefs that attend this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the one of a private, and the other of a public Nature; the one is, that every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual of whom Money has been collected in this Manner, has undoubtedly his Action at Law againſt the Surveyor for the Sum ſo collected of him; the other is, that when the Notice has
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0575600500:46"/>
been ſo negligently given, as that the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof cannot be proved by an unintereſted Witneſs, a Perſon not himſelf liable to do Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Work in the Pariſh, who can ſwear to the Reading it by the Clerk, and is prepared with a Copy of what he heard read, it is odds but every Shilling of the Money forfeited is loſt to the Pariſh.</p>
            <p>This Behaviour of Surveyors, as alſo that Corruption which we ſee daily practiſed by them in garbling the Inhabitants of a Pariſh, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them for their Duty, receiving of ſome five, of others four Shillings, half a Crown, or what many of them like better, a Bowl of Punch, are puniſhable by a Fine of 5<hi>l.</hi> which the Juſtices in their Seſſions have Power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; though a much ſeverer Puniſhment-would await an Officer who ſhould dare to abuſe his Truſt in ſuch a Manner.</p>
            <p>But this, and many other Evils of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are in a great Meaſure owing to the Practice of electing Tradeſmen, and Perſons in a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſarily dependent and ſubject to Influence, into parochial Offices. There are many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in this Kingdom, where all the Offices of Churchwarden, Overſeer of the Poor, Surveyor of the Highways, and Conſtable, are borne by a few of the Inferior Inhabitants in a Rotation ſo quick, as hardly to allow of a ſingle Year's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0575600500:47"/>
for any one of them; while the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, perhaps from a Contempt of an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which requires little more than to be able to write and keep a Year's Account, or for other Reaſons, ſit by and ſee the Public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded and the Law eluded. There is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which every Man is under, who parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates in the Benefits that accrue to Society from Government and Laws, which will render it very difficult for thoſe who are qualified, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged in Trades or Profeſſions, to find an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for ſuch Supineneſs, thoſe who can do it are welcome to all the Satisfaction it can afford them. A Method which has been practiſed in ſome Pariſhes, and is conſtantly purſued in a very conſiderable one adjacent to the Metropolis, of joining a Gentleman of large Fortune, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Nobleman, with a Tradeſman, in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Office, has been found to produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Advantages; and were it to become univerſally a Faſhion, the Public would ſoon be ſenſible of its good Effects.</p>
            <p>Such are the Inconveniencies the Public feel, and the Hardſhips that the lower Claſs of People endure in the ſeveral Particulars above inſiſted on; the repeated Complaints of thoſe who are moſt affected by the Inequality of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Laws, have never yet prevailed further than to produce ſuch Amendments and Alterations from Time to Time as the immediate Exigencies
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0575600500:48"/>
of the Caſe ſuggeſted. How far the Laws in this Reſpect are even now ſhort of that Degree of Perfection which they are capable of being wrought up to, we may in ſome Meaſure col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from the Sentiments of Mr. <hi>Burn,</hi> who ſays that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Moſt of the Books are remarkably confuſed under this Title, occaſioned by a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Statutes ſtanding unrepealed, and yet altered perhaps five or ſix Times or oftener, by ſucceeding Statutes."</q> 
               <hi>Burn's Juſtice,</hi> Tit. <hi>Highways,</hi> at the Beginning.—He afterwards gives his Senſe of this Matter more at large in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Terms; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Notwithſtanding that the Wiſdom of the Nation hath been employed for above Two hundred Years in redreſſing the great Evil of bad Roads, yet, excepting in ſome Caſes, where Turnpikes have been erected, the Roads are as bad now as they were in the Days of <hi>Philip &amp; Mary;</hi> and the Defect is in many Places not ſo much the Want of Hands, as of proper Direction. The ſame Multitudes which aſſemble to demoliſh a Turnpike at the Hazard of their Liberty and Lives, are able, and I doubt not would be willing, if rightly inſtructed, to make the Roads good without paying Turnpike-Tolls: but the Misfortune is this, although the Laws have provided that the Surveyors ſhall be choſen out of the more ſubſtantial Inhabitants, yet when that is done, ſcarce one of them in Five hundred knows how to make a good
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0575600500:49"/>
Road; and if he does, his Power continues in Effect but Six Days, and his Succeſſor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hath other Schemes and Notions, and the Road is made never the better. Hence it is, that when the People aſſemble to repair the Highways, if indeed they do aſſemble, they ſpend the Time in Diverſions and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Bargains, and other idle Amuſements, and why ſhould they not? they may as well meet and do nothing, as work hard, and to no Purpoſe. And from ſo many Years Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the Caſe will never be any otherwiſe unleſs the Juſtices of the Peace, or others in like Manner, as the Turnpike-Truſtees, ſhall have Power given to them by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to appoint general Surveyors within pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Diſtricts, with Salaries, to lay out the Roads, and attend and direct the Work, and ſee the Statute-Labour well performed. And this may be effected without any new Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Charge: half the preſent Aſſeſſment of Six-pence in the Pound, or even leſs than half, would be ſufficient in many Places both to find Salaries, and to widen and purchaſe Roads where needful; and the People, when they ſhould find the Benefit of their Labour, would work with Chearfulneſs.</q>

            <p>There is nothing in the Paſſage above cited that indicates a Neceſſity for annihilating the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0575600500:50"/>
Statute-Duty; on the contrary the Author's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal for an Alteration of the Laws ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Continuance of it; and indeed it is well worthy the Attention of Parliament how far it may be prudent to indulge the People in their preſent Belief of the Omnipotence of Wealth. The Practice of commuting with Money for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Services and manual Labour will ever tend to render them Scandalous. <hi>Homer,</hi> whoſe Writings are ſuppoſed to exhibit a very juſt Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the antient Modes of Living, ſeems to have thought it no Degradation of a Hero to make him his own Cook; on the contrary, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent refined State of human Manners, it would be reproachful for a Perſon of but ordinary Rank to perform many of the Functions neceſſary to his own Support; the Time may come when Agriculture and other rural Employments will be as diſhonourable in <hi>England</hi> as they have long been in <hi>Spain;</hi> and when the Evil of bad Roads will be more tolerable than the Diſgrace of having contributed any otherwiſe to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of them than by a Diſplay of that Opulence which ſeems now to be the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Diſtinction between Man and Man. With good Reaſon therefore did the antient Policy of our Conſtitution render the baſeſt Services ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, by converting them into feudal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, and requiring the Nobility to do that for their Sovereign which they would now diſdain to do for themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0575600500:51"/>
The Objections which Mr. <hi>Burn</hi> makes are in Truth reducible to two, the Multiplicity of the Laws in the Inſtance now under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ill Direction of the Power given by them; the latter of theſe Inconveniencies may undoubtedly be remedied, by committing that Power to thoſe who have no Temptations to abuſe it; but the former is an Objection of Weight, is of general Importance; and requires a very ſerious Attention.</p>
            <p>The Statutes relating to the Amendment and Repair of the Highways are not fewer than twelve in Number, made at different Times as Neceſſity required, and abounding with Clauſes which the utmoſt Skill in the Modes of legal reaſoning will not enable us to reconcile. Clauſes in the older Statutes have been ſuffered to ſtand unrepealed, though ſuch Clauſes were altered and amended by ſubſequent Acts; different Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties have been inflicted for the ſame Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion by different Statutes, all of which are yet ſuffered to ſubſiſt; and thus the Highway Laws have inſenſibly accumulated to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to become a Subject of univerſal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
            <p>It is true, that the Multiplicity of our Statute Laws has been ſo long lamented, that Objections of this Sort are looked on as trite; and as they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0575600500:52"/>
contain nothing but what has been urged before, unworthy the public Attention. It is near twenty Years ſince <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> endeavoured to palliate this Misfortune by remarking, that the Multiplicity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws is the Price that the People of that Country pay for their Liberty; but what Equivalent can they expect for that Premium, when the Laws become ſo numerous, that they cannot be executed; and thoſe whom they were intended to bind are thereby in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abſolved from their Obedience? what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is to fear that this may one Day be the Caſe, will appear on reflecting on the enormous Increaſe in the Volume of our Statute Book within theſe few Years. Six Years after the Revolution two Folio Volumes contained the public Statutes in Force from <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> By the Seventh Year of the late King they were grown to Six; and at the Expiration of the Thirtieth Year of his Reign, which was Twenty three Years after, they amounted to Nine; during which Period not a ſingle Seſſion paſſed that did not add ſeveral Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to that incredible Number which the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces already had in Charge to ſee executed.</p>
            <p>What a tremendous Proſpect then has the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate before his Eyes, who reſolves to diſcharge his Duty by the legal and conſcientious Exertion of his Authority! <hi>Lambarde,</hi> that learned and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Writer, and faithful Servant of the Public, in his <hi>Eirenarcha,</hi> written ſo long ago as the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0575600500:53"/>
Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> enumerates but eight Statutes that concerned the Juſtices of the Peace; which, in his quaint Way of expreſſing himſelf, were then thought, a Load ſufficient to break the Back of any Juſtice, and now thoſe Statutes are encreaſed to a Number not far ſhort of Two hundred.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Legiſlature have in ſome few Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces yielded to the preſſing Neceſſity of the Times, and conſolidated ſeveral Statutes relating to one common Subject, particularly in the Caſes of the Navy and Militia Acts, into one general Law: this Method was originally ſuggeſted by the great Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> to his Maſter <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, and we find in the <hi>Journals of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> 18 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. a Vote <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That a Committee be appointed to confer with ſuch of the Lords the Judges and other Perſons of the Long Robe, who have already taken Pains and made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in peruſing the Statute-Laws, and to conſider of repealing ſuch former Statute-Laws as they ſhall find neceſſary to be repealed, and of Expedients of reducing all Statute-Laws of one Nature under ſuch a Method and Head as may conduce to the more ready underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and better Execution of ſuch Laws."</q> 
               <hi>Journals of the Houſe of Commons, Octob.</hi> 4. 18 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. The ſame Propoſal has been often reiterated with Reſpect to the Laws relating to the Poor, but without Effect; and, except the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0575600500:54"/>
Inſtances above-mentioned, it has never yet been carried into Execution.</p>
            <p>Whoever has been uſed to turn over our Statute Book will have other Reaſons than thoſe above aſſigned, to wiſh that ſome ſuch Regulation as this may ſoon take Place in the Inſtance now before us; for, not to mention the Confuſion that neceſſarily follows from the frequent mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Clauſes to be met with in many of them, the very Language of ſome of our Statutes is very inartificial, and reflects but little Honour on thoſe that framed them. There is a Statute of 4 <hi>Geo. cap.</hi> 7. relating to <hi>Button-making,</hi> which <hi>Burn</hi> calls a <hi>looſe, injudicious,</hi> and <hi>ungrammatical</hi> Act and adds, that it may well enough ſeem to have been drawn up by <hi>Taylors</hi> or <hi>Button<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi> themſelves: the Perſpicuity and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many of our old Statutes are ſtanding Evidences how much our Anceſtors exceeded us in the Science of Legiſlation. <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> allowing for ſome Barbariſms made inevitable by the Uſe of a Language extinct long before the Objects of that Law had any Exiſtence, is in theſe Reſpects a model of Perfection; and the Statute <hi>De donis conditionalibus,</hi> the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>Uſes,</hi> and of <hi>Frauds and Perjuries</hi> are admirable Efforts of human Wiſdom and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
            <p>For the Reaſons above ſtated, it is with all due Deference apprehended, that the ſeveral Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0575600500:55"/>
now in Force relating to the Highways ſtand in need of a Review; and that thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes may be ſo altered, amended, and improved, as to be clear of moſt of the Difficulties that at preſent obſtruct their Execution, that half the Labour and Expence which the Public are at preſent at, would ſuffice to keep the Highways in as good Condition as the Turnpike-Roads are now in; and that the Burthen of amending them from Time to Time might be impoſed in ſuch a Manner as to do no Injury to the Rich, and take away all Poſſibility of Complaint from the Poor; and laſtly, that an Act of Parliament calculated with theſe Views, might be ſo framed as to be as eaſy in its Execution, as laudable in its Deſign.</p>
            <p>The principal Objects to be attended to in the framing a Law for theſe Purpoſes, are, that the Burthen thereby to be laid on the Public be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the reſpective Circumſtances and Abilities of thoſe who are to bear it, and that thoſe who make the greateſt Uſe of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhould contribute moſt to keep them in Repair. More particularly Care ſhould be taken to extend the Qualification of 50<hi>l.</hi> a Year to Houſes, Lands, and every other Species of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement and Hereditament lying, as the Law phraſes it, in <hi>Livery.</hi> The Tax on Gentlemen of large perſonal Eſtates, and who keep Coaches, Chariots, and other Wheel-Carriages ſhould be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0575600500:56"/>
adjuſted in a Compound <hi>Ratio</hi> of their Wealth, and the Uſe they are ſuppoſed to make of the Highways. Thoſe who ſhall have the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendence of the Highways ſhould be Perſons of greater Property than are uſually appointed to that Office; and, perhaps it might be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to inveſt the Juſtices with an Authority to appoint ſome one Perſon ſkilled in the Buſineſs of Road-making as a Kind of perpetual Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, removeable nevertheleſs at Pleaſure, and whoſe Buſineſs it ſhould be for a Salary to lay out the Roads and attend and direct the Work, as thoſe do who are appointed by Turnpike Truſtees, and who ſhall be amenable to the Juſtices, and anſwerable at Law in like Manner as the Surveyors at preſent are.</p>
            <p>The above Obſervations ſufficiently ſhew the Neceſſity and the Juſtice of inſtituting a new Claſs of Contributors to the Repair of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; namely, Perſons who keep Coaches, Chariots, or other Wheel-Carriages. When that is done, the Proportions in which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to contribute may be adjuſted thus:</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Ten</hi> Days be appointed for the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Highways inſtead of <hi>Six,</hi> and let every Perſon occupying two or more Ploughlands ſend a Draught on every of thoſe Days, and let him that occupies only one Ploughland ſend a Draught five Days only, on Pain to forfeit in the firſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0575600500:57"/>
Caſe, and alſo in the other 30<hi>s.</hi> for every Day's Default. Perſons occupying divers Ploughlands in divers Pariſhes, ſhould ſend a Draught five Days for each Ploughland. Thoſe who are not to ſend a Draught may be charged according to the following Scheme. <table>

            <p>But as all the Inhabitants are not to work on every one of the Ten Days, and to prevent the aſſembling of more of them than the Surveyors can employ, the Surveyors, beſides publiſhing Notice in the Church, ſhould have Power given them to call out by Summons in Writing the ſeveral Perſons by ſuch Numbers at a Time as they ſhall find neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Perſons who keep Coaches, Chariots, or Poſt-Chaiſes for their own Uſe, and not for Hire, and are not charged as Land-holders, ſhould pay 10<hi>s.</hi> if with four Horſes 15<hi>s.</hi> and if with ſix Horſes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0575600500:58"/>
20<hi>s.</hi> a Year, over and above their Proportion of Labour.</p>
            <p>This Mode of Taxation, it is to be obſerved, is calculated rather to preſerve the Highways in a continual State of Repair, than to anſwer immediate Exigencies; it will therefore be neceſſary to continue the Power of making Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſments in the Manner preſcribed by the Laws now in Force, which Power may be exerciſed either for immediate Improvements, or in Aid of the Statute-Duty.</p>
            <p>Something alſo ſhould be done with Reſpect to Evidence. It is an unconteſted Rule in Law, that no Perſon can be a Witneſs to a Fact which will either directly or conſequentially affect his own Intereſt: The Law in a general View is doubtleſs very reaſonable that thus diſqualifies a Man, and yet his Intereſt may be ſo ſmall or ſo remote in a particular Inſtance, as to contribute no more towards determining his Evidence than a ſingle Hair does to the Trepidation of a Scale-Beam capable of ſuſpending a Ton Weight; notwithſtanding which the Law knows no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Degree, and its Care to prevent the Operation of inſenſible Prejudices is uniformly the ſame in all Caſes. How great that Care is ſuppoſed to be, we may infer from the Conduct of the late Lord <hi>Raymond,</hi> in an Inſtance yet in the Memory of Perſons now living, who, being Lord Chief Juſtice of the Court of King's Bench,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0575600500:59"/>
becauſe he lived in the Pariſh of <hi>Abbot's Langley</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford,</hi> went off the Bench when an Order relating to that Pariſh came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court. See <hi>Strange's Reports</hi> 1173. It is doubtleſs for Reaſons of this Kind, that a Freeman of a corporate Town is no legal Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a local Cuſtom within that Town, and the Practice is for ſuch a one in that Caſe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be diſenfranchiſed before he gives his Evidence. In the Caſe now under Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a Pariſhioner who ſhould ſwear to any of the Facts which make a Part of that Chain of Evidence requiſite to juſtify a Diſtreſs on a Defaulter, ſuch as the Publication of Notice of the Six Days appointed for doing the Statute Work, the Non-Attendance of the Defaulter, the Service of the Summons to ſhew Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would by ſuch his Evidence contribute to exonerate the Pariſh and himſelf as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioner, from an Aſſeſſment which the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of the Statute-Labour might make neceſſary; it is therefore apprehended, that no Pariſhioner is a competent Witneſs in this Caſe, and that even the Pariſh-Clerk could not be examined to prove the Publication in his Church of Notice of the Six Days, even though he read it himſelf, nor in ſhort can any one be a Witneſs for this Purpoſe but a Stranger in the Pariſh, or a Servant, or other Perſon not liable to do Statute-Duty. We know, that in Favour of Juſtice, the Law has frequently interpoſed to remove legal Diſabilities of Witneſſes and others:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0575600500:60"/>
By a late Statute, the Teſtimony of Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Eſtabliſhment of a Will is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſable to prove the Execution of it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes. By a Statute of 16 <hi>Geo.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. Juſtices may execute the Laws for puniſhing Vagrants, repairing the Highways, and the other Laws concerning parochial Taxes, Levies, or Rates, notwithſtanding they are rated or chargeable with the Rates within any Place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by ſuch their Acts. And by 26 <hi>Geo.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. for licenſing Ale-Houſes, any Perſon ſhall be a competent Witneſs upon any Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or Complaint for any Offence againſt that Act, notwithſtanding ſuch Perſon be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of, or charged to the Payment of any Rates for the Relief of the Poor of any Pariſh or Place where ſuch Offence ſhall be committed, and a Clauſe of Two or three Lines would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Defect here complained of, ſave conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sums, and prevent vexatious Suits in many Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>The Advantages ariſing from the Uſe of broad Wheels are ſo apparent, that it would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to inſiſt on them; this is certain, that by means of them the Price of Carriage from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>London</hi> has been reduced 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not practicable to render the Uſe of them ſtill more general, may be worthy Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. At preſent they are found not to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo well in croſs Ways as in the great
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0575600500:61"/>
Roads; the former are in moſt Countries ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Incloſures on each Side, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of but one Track; whereas, were Power given to the Juſtices to widen thoſe Ways enough to allow of quartering, the Uſe of broad Wheels would become univerſal, and produce the ſame Benefit as in the great High Roads; where, as has often been obſerved, they do the Office of a Roller.</p>
            <p>The miſchievous Practice of riding in Carts is not yet ſufficiently checked by the many Laws lately made to prevent it: certainly there is as much Reaſon to empower a Juſtice to convict on a View of this Offence, as in any other Caſe where this Power is given.</p>
            <p>In the penning of ſuch a Statute as is here propoſed, Regard ſhould be had to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Courts, particularly of the King's Bench on Appeals from Seſſions upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Points, and thoſe Clauſes that have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by any ſuch Determinations, ſhould be carefully preſerved; as on the contrary, thoſe that have been condemned or adjudged nugatory ſhould be amended or totally rejected.</p>
            <p>It has been urged as a general Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Alteration of the Highway-Laws, with Regard to the Proportion of the Statute-Labour, that the ſeeming Inequality of the Law is at laſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0575600500:62"/>
ſet right by the Advantages accruing to the Poor from the Cheapneſs and Plenty which reſult from good Roads, and a ſpeedy Conveyance of the Neceſſaries of Life: But are theſe Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges peculiar to the Poor? do not the Rich par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of them? nay, have they not by much the greateſt Share? A poor Labourer, who earns 9<hi>s.</hi> a Week pays yearly a two-and-fiftieth Part of his Year's Income for theſe Advantages, whatever they are; does a rich Man pay after that Rate? Is there any Gentleman of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds a Year in the Kingdom, though he keeps a Coach, and wears the Roads more in a Week, than ſuch a Man can poſſibly do in ten Years, who pays Nineteen Pounds a Year to the Highways?</p>
            <p>There are, it muſt be confeſſed, ſome Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of a different Nature againſt the inferior Claſs of People in this Kingdom, which ſeem to ſtand in the Way of any Regulations of this Sort in their Behalf; namely, their extreme Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs beyond what is ſeen in other Countries, their Contempt of Religion and the Laws, their Want of Reſpect for their Superiors, their Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Profaneneſs, Intemperance, and a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Vices.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed to refute the Arguments commonly deduced from theſe Premiſſes, let us enquire whether the Fact has any Foundation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0575600500:63"/>
or not. It is certain, that the lower Sort of People amongſt us are neither ſo diſſolute nor ungovernable as they have been in Times which we have been taught to look on with more Reverence than perhaps is due to them. Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Inſurrections are much leſs frequent than they were formerly; and thoſe who mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Vices of the common People, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them as leſs obedient to Government than heretofore, forget that they have within theſe very few Years ſeen Thouſands of theſe People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by ſome one common Principle, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it has been, forſaking their Relations and Friends, expoſing their Lives in Defence of their Country, and extending the Reputation of its Courage and Humanity beyond that of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World.</p>
            <p>As to their Intemperance, it has never been ſo great as to be beyond the Power of Laws to reduce it within tolerable Limits: thoſe lately made to reſtrain the Uſe of ſpirituous Liquors are Inſtances how much it is in the Power of a Legiſlature to effect.</p>
            <p>But admitting the Juſtice of the above Charge, and that the lower Sort of People are ever ſo diſſolute, ſhall we therefore deny them Juſtice? for that as far as it concerns them, is all that is now contended for; ſhall we refuſe to diſcharge them from a greater Load of public Duty,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0575600500:64"/>
than they are able to bear, at the ſame Time that we are, with a Zeal unequalled in any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Age, and with a Charity as ſincere as it is wild and injudicious, anticipating their Wants, ſetting their ſelfiſh and ſocial Affections at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and even laying in their Way Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Idleneſs, and thoſe other Vices of which we accuſe them?</p>
            <p>The Truth of the Matter is, that Subjects of this Nature, ſtrictly ſpeaking, are Part of the grand Science of Politics, the very firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples whereof very few are able to conceive, and which ſtill fewer are able to reaſon about, who can pretend to ſay how much the Immorality of any People exceeds that Degree of it which ſeems to be interwoven in the Conſtitution of the moral World? All that concerns us as Men, is to diſcourage it as much as poſſible, for which Purpoſe it has ever been the Practice of wiſe Legiſlators to conſider human Nature as it really is, rather than as what they would wiſh it to be, to encourage Virtue, and keep down Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by proper Sanctions, and ſo to temper the various and conflicting Appetites and Humours of Mankind, as to produce good upon the whole.</p>
            <p>There are various Cauſes which contribute to produce that Licentiouſneſs of which we ſo much complain; one of the moſt prevailing ſeems to be the little Attention that Men at this Day are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0575600500:65"/>
diſpoſed to pay to Virtue as it reſults from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; our very Modes of Expreſſion imply our Diſregard of it; we no longer ſay of a Man, that he is a Man of Integrity, or Probity, or that he is beneficent or charitable, but that he has a <hi>good Heart,</hi> is a <hi>good Sort</hi> of Man, or a <hi>good Creature;</hi> for which cant Phraſes we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the fertile Invention of a deceaſed Wit, whoſe Writings, paltry and flimſy as they are, it is to be feared, may do more Miſchief to Society than thoſe of <hi>Hobbes</hi> or <hi>Spinoza.</hi> The inevitable Conſequence of that looſe Syſtem of Morality by which the real or ſuppoſed Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Man's Intention, and not the Dictates of thoſe who have a Right to govern, is made the Rule of his Conduct, is the Contempt of all poſitive Inſtitutions, of Law, of Religion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Law, conſidered as a Rule of Action, and as calculated to extend and improve the Bleſſings of ſocial Life, is, next to Religion, an Object the moſt venerable; but ſuch is the Temper of Mankind, that they look on it with Abhorrence, and form Confederacies to defeat its Purpoſes: neceſſary Penalties to enforce the moſt beneficial Statutes are conſidered as Infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of private Liberty, and it is much leſs criminal in the Eye of the Public to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a Law, than it is to aſſiſt in bringing the Offender to Juſtice; the Man who inſtead
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0575600500:66"/>
of driving, rides in his Cart, in Contempt of the Law, and at the Riſque of the Lives of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects, is far leſs odious to the Populace than he who ſhall inform againſt him; and thus it may be ſaid that the Laws and the People are in a State of perpetual Hoſtility.</p>
            <p>The State of Magiſtracy is therefore <q rend="inline">"a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pre-eminence,"</q> in which a Man becomes odious by doing Good; and he whoſe public Spirit would induce him to take upon himſelf the trouble of procuring Obedience to the Laws of his Country, muſt relinquiſh the Endeavour if he has not alſo Fortitude enough to deſpiſe the ſecret Malevolence of thoſe who have formed an erroneous Judgment of the Extent of civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the clamourous Invectives of others who conſider the ſlandering and traducing the Characters of all in Authority, as the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Reaſon we ſee ſo many Perſons whoſe Knowledge and Abilities enable them to promote the Quiet, Safety, and Happineſs of Mankind as Magiſtrates, decline that Service, and a Truſt of the greateſt Importance to the Lives and Liberties of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects executed in ſome Inſtances by Mercenaries; but it is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wiſhed, that inſtead of indulging a ſelfiſh Indolence and Timidity, they would exert themſelves in the common Cauſe, and endeavour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0575600500:67"/>
to avoid the Obloquy, which ſo generally attends the producing remote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd general good, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the immediate and particular Evil of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, not by eluding the Duty, but by ſhewing that they diſcharge it upon Principles of true Benevolence, and that while they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh themſelves in their public Capacity, by their Diligence and Activity to mark and to puniſh Offences, they would alſo recommend themſelves in private Life, by the Exerciſe of thoſe milder Virtues, which give Luſtre to the moſt exalted Station.</p>
            <p>The Service of the Public is indeed declined in ſome Inſtances, which admit of no Apology. Can it be thought that our early Forefathers ever imagined that a Time would come when nearly all the Freeholders of a whole County ſhould ſubmit to an annual Contribution, levied by the meaneſt of its Servants, the legal Retinue of a Sheriff, to avoid ſerving on Juries? or that the Legiſlature would ever find it neceſſary to hire Men of Eſtates to do that Duty which every Friend to Liberty ſhould rejoice at being called to?</p>
            <p>Inſtances of public ſpirit, however, are not wanting among us. What Difficulties, what Diſcouragements, have thoſe Gentlemen ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, who, from the nobleſt Motives have laboured in the Eſtabliſhment of a national Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0575600500:68"/>
a Meaſure to which, next to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, this Country may be ſaid to owe its Salvation!</p>
            <p>But whatever are the Faults of the Times, it certainly behoves every Government to provide that the Laws are at leaſt free from Oppreſſion or Inequality: thoſe which are here examined are manifeſtly not ſo; and whoever has Weight and Intereſt enough to procure ſuch Alterations and Amendments of them, as upon a careful Review may be found to be neceſſary, will by exerting his Endeavours for that End, perform for his Country a moſt acceptable Service, and endear his Memory to lateſt Poſterity.</p>
