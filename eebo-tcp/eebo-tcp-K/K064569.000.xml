            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

make a Dedication of this
Diſcourſe to your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi>
than to ſubmit it to your acute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
expecting ſoon to hear of your
Approbation or Diſlike of it. If it
ſo happen, that you highly approve
of it, I beg of you to be ſparing of

               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1207700100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In my <hi>Moderator,</hi> ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
dropt from ny Pen about the
Miracles of our Saviour, which, for
want of Illuſtration then, gave your
<hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſome offence, and brought
upon me more Trouble: But, having
now fully and clearly explain'd my ſelf
out of the Fathers, I hope you'll be
reconciled to me; and as you are a
Lover of Truth, will, againſt Intereſt
and Prejndice, yield to the Force
of it.</p>
            <p>Whether your Proſecution of me,
for the <hi>Moderator,</hi> was juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
I'll not diſpute here, having
already expoſtulated that matter with
you, in ſeveral Letters, to which you
would not condeſcend to give me any
Anſwer. For what Reaſon you was
ſilent is beſt known to your ſelf. But
in my own Vindication, I hope, I
muy publiſh without Offence, that your
taking me for an <hi>Infidel</hi> was ſuch a
Miſtake, as I thought no <hi>Schoar</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:1207700100:4"/>
could have made; and the Injury done
to my Reputation and low Fortunes,
by the Proſecution, ſo conſiderable, that
the leaſt I expected from your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
was a courteous Excuſe, if not an
ample Compenſation for it.</p>
            <p>As to the Expediency of proſecuting
<hi>Infidels</hi> for their writings (in whoſe
Cauſe I am the fartheſt of any Man
from being engaged) I will here ſay
nothing. The Argument, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi>
has already, by one or other, been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
handled. And I don't know,
but I might be, with your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi>
on the perſecuting ſide of the Queſtion;
but that it looks, as if a Man was
diſtruſtful of the Truth of Chriſtianity,
and conſcious of his own Inability to
defend it; or he would leave that good
Cauſe to God himſelf, and the Sword
of the Spirit, without calling upon
the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> for his Aid and
Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1207700100:5"/>
That Scurvy <hi>Writer</hi> of the <hi>Scheme
of litteral Prophecy, &amp;c.</hi> which your
<hi>Lordſhip</hi> muſt have heard of, would
inſinuate, that they are only Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> who, for fear of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
in the Church, ſet Perſecutions
on foot: But after your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> has
publiſh'd a Strenuous Defence of
Chriſtianity to the Purpoſe of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Controverſy, I'll have no ſuch
ſuſpicions of you.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s perſecuting (or if
you will proſecuting) Humour is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putedly
all pure Zeal for God's Glory;
and, with all my Heart, let it be ſo
accounted, whether it be according to
Knowledge or not. Againſt Popery
and Infidelity you are all Ardency!
Who do's not commend you? Who can
queſtion the ſincerity of the Zeal of a
Proteſtant <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and of a Proſteſtant
<hi>Clergy,</hi> when they perſecute the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys
of their Church, that conſiders
their own ſteadineſs to Principles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Intereſt, under all Changes,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1207700100:6"/>
ſince the Reformation; and their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of Extortion upon the People,
for the Dutys of their Function, in and
about this City. Such Honeſty and
Conſtancy in their Profeſſion is a Proof
of the Integrity of their Hearts, or I
know not where to find one.</p>
            <p>But that your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Zeal for
Religion is very remarkable and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
I could prove by many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
one is, <hi>that</hi> of your routing a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
Sect of <hi>Peripateticks</hi> our of St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Cathedral; and if you could
as effectually clear <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church, of
<hi>Infidels,</hi> what a Glorious Biſhop
would you be!</p>
            <p>And what Pitty is it, that <hi>Infidels</hi>
likewiſe are not to be quell'd with your
Threats and Terrors? which (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Weapons of ſharp Reaſonings
and thumping Arguments, that others

I have no doubt of, his <hi>Meſſiahſhip</hi> ſhall be
clearly made out by it.</p>
            <p>And the way in Prophecy, that I would
take for the Proof of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s <hi>Meſſiahſhip</hi>
ſhould be by an Allegorical Interpretation,
and Application of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to him; the very ſame Way, that all
the Fathers of the Church have gone in;
and the very ſame Way, in which all the
Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> ſay their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the Law and the Prophets: But this
Way does not pleaſe our Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
in this Controverſy, neither will they
at preſent give any Ear to it.</p>
            <p>The Way in Prophecy, that they are for
taking is by a Litteral Interpretation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plcation
of ſome Prophecys of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but they are hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful

them with their Objections againſt this Way
of Proof, ſo far as, being ſenſible, I ſay, of
almoſt inſuperable Difficultys in it, they are
flying apace to the Miracles of our Saviour,
as to their ſole and grand Refuge.</p>
            <p>But to ſhow, that there's no Sanctuary
for them in the Miracles of our Saviour, I
write this Diſcourſe: And this I do, not
for the ſervice of Infidelity, which has no
Place in my Heart; but for the honour of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1207700100:10"/>
the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to reduce the <hi>Clergy</hi>

be the Converſion of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Opinion, that there is no Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
in the Miracles of our Saviour, I chanc'd
to ſay in the <hi>Moderator,</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Page 44.</note> 
               <hi>That Jeſus's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as they are now a days underſtood, make
nothing for his Authority and Meſſiahſhip</hi>; and
again, <note n="2" place="bottom">p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>that I believe upon good Authority,
ſome of the Miracles of Jeſus, as recorded by
the Evangeliſts were never wrought, but are
only related as Prophetical and Parabolical
Narratives of what will be myſteriouſly and
more wonderfully done by him:</hi> Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
gave offence to ſome of our <hi>Clergy,</hi>
and brought upon me their Indignation and
Diſpleaſure. I ſee no Reaſon to depart
from the ſaid Expreſſions, or ſo much as
to palliate and ſoften them, much leſs to
retract them; but in maintenance of my
Opinion, to the Honour of our <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and
and the Defence of Chriſtianity, I write
this Treatiſe on Jeſus's Miracles, and take
this method following.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I will ſhow, that the Miracles of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all manner of Bodily Diſeaſes, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1207700100:11"/>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> was juſtly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> neither are
they ſo much as a good Proof of his Divine
Authority to found a Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the litteral Hiſtory of many of
the Miracles of Jeſus, as recorded by the
Evangeliſts, does imply Abſurditys, Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
and Incredibilitys, conſequently,
they, either in whole or in part, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wrought, as they are commonly believed
now a days, but are only related as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
and Parabolical Naratives of what
would be myſteriouſly and more wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done by him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I ſhall conſider what Jeſus means,
when he appeals to his Miracles as to a
Teſtimony and Witneſs of his Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and ſhow, that he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and ultimately referr to thoſe, he then
wrought in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but to thoſe Myſtical
ones, which he would do in the <hi>Spirit</hi>; of
which thoſe wrought in the Fleſh are but
mere Types and Shadows.</p>
            <p>In treating on theſe Heads, I ſhall not
confine my ſelf only to Reaſon, but alſo to
the expreſs Authority of the Fathers, thoſe
holy, venerable and learned Preachers of
he Goſpel in the firſt Ages of the Church,
who took our Religion from the Hands
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1207700100:12"/>
of the Apoſtles and of Apoſtolical Men,
who dy'd, ſome of them, and ſuffer'd for
the Doctrine they taught; who profeſſedly
and confeſſedly were endew'd with Divine
and Extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit; who
conſequently can't be ſuppoſed to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters
of Chriſtianity, or teachers of falſe
Notions about the Miracles of our Saviour,
of ſo much as miſtaken about the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
and Evangelical Senſe and Nature of
them. I know not how it comes to paſs,
but I am a profound Admirer and an almoſt
implicit Believer of the Authority of the
Fathers, whom I look upon as vaſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophres,
very great Scholars, and moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Divines. Whatever they concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
aſſert, I firmly believe. And tho'
they are, for the moſt part, myſterious
Writers out of the Reach of the Capacitys
of many, who ſlight them; yet I, who have
had the Honour and Happineſs of much of
their Acquaintance, fancy my ſelf well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
of their meanings. If at any time
I read a Paſſage in them, which I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
apprehend, I ſalute it with Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for all that; till my Underſtanding is
open'd to receive the ſenſe of it. If I meet
with but a ſingle Opinion in any one of
them, I pay my Reſpects to it; but where
there is an Harmony and Agreement of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
amongſt them, it is with me and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1207700100:13"/>
ought to be with all Chriſtians, of ſuch
Weight as to bear down all Prejudice,
Oppoſition, and Contradiction before it; or
the Authority of no Man, whether Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or Modern is to have any Regard paid
to it; and of what ill Conſequence to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ſuch an utter Rejection of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will be, I need not ſay.</p>
            <p>This I thought fit to premiſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Authority of the Fathers, to abate
of the Prejudice beforehand, which ſome
may conceive againſt the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
about the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> I don't
queſtion, but ſome may be ſtartled at the
foregoing Heads, as if, what is the fartheſt
of any thing from my Heart, the ſervice
of Infidelity was in View; but craving
the Temper and Patience of ſuch Readers
for a while, and they ſhall find, that it's no
other than juſt Reaſoning, clear Truth, and
Primitive Doctrine about <hi>Jeſus's</hi> Miracles,
that I advance; or if it ſhould ſo happen,
that none beſides my ſelf ſhould diſcern the
Reaſoning and Truth of the Argument;
yet I hope it will not be thought a Crime
to revive Primitive Doctrine, which none
will be able to deny it to be, whether they
like it or not. If I err, I err upon Choice
with the Fathers, of whoſe Faith I am.
And if any are offended at what follows
about the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> let them turn
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1207700100:14"/>
their Diſpleaſure and Indignation againſt the
Fathers, for whoſe expreſs or implicit O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
I can be deſerving of no Blame.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry for the occaſion of ſuch a
Preface againſt Offence, which the Apoſtacy
of the Age, and its Unacquaintedneſs with
the Fathers has made neceſſary. So I enter
upon the particular Handling of the Heads
foregoing. And</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <p>I. I will ſhow that the Miracles of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all manner of Bodily Diſeaſes, which
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was juſtly famed for; are none of the
proper Miracles of the Meſſiah, nor are
they ſo much as a good Proof of <hi>Jeſus's</hi>
Divine Authority to found and introduce
a Religion into the World.</p>
               <p>And to do this, let us conſider firſt in
general, what was the Opinion, of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
about the Writings of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi>
in which the Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is recorded.
<hi>Eucherius</hi> ſays, <note n="3" place="bottom">Univerſam porro Sacram Scripturam tam Novi quam Veteris Teſtamenti ad allegoricum ſenſum eſſe ſumendam, admonet nos vel illud, Aperiam os meum in Parabolis. <hi>In Praſat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

his Opinion, is no other, than the common
one of the firſt Ages of the Church, as
might be proved by many the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1207700100:15"/>
of other Fathers. As in ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
they do not except the Writings
of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi>; ſo they muſt include the
Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Miracles, which as well
as other Parts of the Hyſtory of his Life is
to be allegoriz'd for the ſake of its true
meaning; conſequently the litteral Story of
Chriſt's Miracles proves nothing.</p>
               <p>But let's hear particularly their Opinion
of the Actions and Miracles of our Saviour.
<hi>Origen</hi> ſays, that <note n="4" place="bottom">Si quidem Symbola quaedam erant quae tunc ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebantur eorum, quae Jeſu virtute ſemper preficiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>In</hi> Mat. <hi>C.</hi> xv.</note> 
                  <hi>whatſoever Jeſus did in

the Works of Jeſus import farther Myſteries;
and with them, the reſt of the Fathers agree,
making the Miracles, that Jeſus did then,
no more than the Shadow of ſome more
powerful and myſtical Operations to be done
by him; as I could ſhow by more Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of them, if it was needful. But
from the foregoing Citations out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
it is plain, in their Opinion, that our
modern <hi>Divines</hi> are in the wrong of it to
lay much Streſs on any of the Operations
of Jeſus, which he did in the Fleſh, for the
Proof of his Divine Authority and <hi>Meſſiah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
which is only to be proved by his
more myſterious Works, of which thoſe
done in the Fleſh were but Type and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p>But to come cloſer to the Purpoſe, let's
ſee how indifferently, I had almoſt ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly,
the Fathers ſpeak of the Miracles
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and particularly of his Power of
Healing all bodily Diſeaſes, which by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>Writers</hi> is ſo much magnified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd.
St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſays, <note n="9" place="bottom">Si enim temporalis erat ab eo Utilitas, nihil grande praeſtitit iis, qui ab eo curati ſunt, <hi>L.V.</hi> c. 12. <hi>S.</hi> 6.</note> that if <hi>we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
only the then temporal Uſe of Jeſus's Power</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1207700100:17"/>
                  <hi>of Healing, he did nothing grand and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi>;
conſequently <hi>Irenaeus</hi> could not hold,
that Jeſus's Miracles then wrought, were
a ſufficient Proof of his Divine Authority
much leſs of his <hi>Meſſiahſhip. Origen</hi> ſays, <note n="10" place="bottom">Contra Celſum, <hi>L.</hi> 11.</note> that <hi>tho' many were brought to believe in
Jeſus upon the fame of the Miracles, which he
did once among the</hi> Jews, <hi>yet</hi> (what implies
the inſufficiency of them for the Converſion
of Men) <hi>he intimates that his greater and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Works do prove his Authority.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſays, <note n="11" place="bottom">Coecum curavit magnum quidem eſt, quod fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, ſed niſi quotidie fiat, quod olim factum, nobis quidem magnum eſſe ceſſavit, <hi>Homil.</hi> 30. <hi>in</hi> Marc. 9.</note> that <hi>Jeſus's cures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd

and great, but unleſs he do daily as
mighty Works in his Church, we ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
our Admiration of him.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
not only ſays, <note n="12" place="bottom">Si humano captu &amp; ingenio conſideremus Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum facientem, &amp; quod ad poteſtatem non magnum aliquid fecit, &amp; quod ad benignitatem, parvum ſecit, <hi>in</hi> Johan <hi>cap.</hi> v. Tract. 17.</note> that <hi>if we examine into
Jeſus's Miracles by humane Reaſon, we ſhall
find he did nothing great, conſidering his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power, and conſidering his Goodneſs,
what he did was but little,</hi> but he tells us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that <note n="13" place="bottom">Etſi atteſtabantur Miracula, non defuiſſent (ſicut &amp; nunc muſſitant) qui magicae potentiae cuncta illa tribuerent. <hi>Cont. Fauſt.</hi> L. XII. c. 45.</note> 
                  <bibl>such Works as Jeſus did, might</bibl>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1207700100:18"/>
                  <hi>be imputed to, and effected by magic Art.</hi>
And accordingly <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Saviour
himſelf confeſs, that falſe Prophets and falſe
Chriſt's will do Miracles; and <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi>
himſelf, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> will do them
to the Deception of Mankind. Nay, the
Fathers <note n="14" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Sanctum Auguſtinum</hi> de <hi>Anti-chriſto.</hi>
                  </note> ſay, what I believe, that
<hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> will imitate and equal <hi>Jeſus</hi> in
all his Miracles, which he wrought of old.
How then can we diſtinguiſh the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
from the falſe, the true Chriſt from the
Anti chriſt by Miracles? Our Divines will
find it hard to do it, if what the Fathers
ſay of <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> be found true. Moreover
Hiſtory affords us Inſtances of Men, ſuch as
of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus, Veſpaſian,</hi> and of the
<hi>Iriſh Stroker, Greatrex,</hi> who have miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
cured Diſeaſes to the Admiration of
Mankind, as well as our Jeſus; but if any
of them, or any other greater Worker of
Miracles, than they were, ſhould withal
aſſume to himſelf the Title of a Prophet,
and Author of a new Religion, I humbly
conceive, we ought not to give heed to
him.</p>
               <p>Neither is there the leaſt Reaſon, that
we ſhould; for the Power of doing Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
is no certain, nor rational Seal of the
Commiſſion, and Authority of a Divine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1207700100:19"/>
Lawgiver. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays <note n="15" place="bottom">i Corinth. C. xii.</note> there is a
<hi>Diverſity of the Gifts of the Spirit, for to
one is given by the Spirit, the Word of
Wiſdom; to another the Word of Knowledge;
to another the Gift of Healing; to another
the working of Miracles; to another Prophecy;
to another Diſcerning of Spirits; to another
Divers Kinds of Tongues; to another the
Interpretation of Tongues.</hi> Theſe Gifts may
be given a part and ſeparately. One of
them may be conferr'd on this Man, and
another of them on his Neighbour. There
is no neceſſity, that any two or more of
theſe Gifts ſhould meet in one Man. To
argue then, that a Man, who has one of
theſe Gifts, muſt needs have the other,
that is, that he muſt needs have the Gift
of Wiſdom, or of Prophecy, or of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
of Spirits, or of Divers kinds of
Tongues, becauſe he has the Gift of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and of working Miracles, is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive
and falſe Reaſoning: And yet
this is the Reaſoning of our modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
who would prove <hi>Jeſus's</hi> Authority,
to found a Religion, from his Miracles.
I don't queſtion, but <hi>Jeſus</hi> had all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Gifts, and Powers of the Spirit in a
moſt ſuperlative Degree; but then it is
unreaſonably inferr'd, for all that, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1207700100:20"/>
a Man, becauſe he of certainty has ſome
of them, muſt of conſequence have the other.

                  <note n="16" place="bottom">Atque illud ad Rem maxime partineat, ne decipiamur tendentes ad Contemplationem Veritatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbitrantes ibi oſſe inviſibilem ſapientiam, ubi Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum viſibile viderimus. <hi>In Sermon.

being deceived into a good Opinion of a
Man's Wiſdom, becauſe of his Power to

that we may as well ſay, that the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Man is the wiſeſt; or that a good
Phyſician muſt needs be a good Caſuiſt; or
that the beſt Mathematician is the ableſt
Stateſman, as that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he was a
worker of Miracles, ſuch as his are, and
a Healer of all manner of Diſeaſes, ought
to be received as the Guide of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
the Director of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the Ruler of our Hearts, and the
Author of a Religion.</p>
               <p>What then will the Writers againſt
the <hi>Grounds</hi> do to prove <hi>Jeſus's</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Meſſiahſhip from his Miracles?
Or how by his Miracles will they be
able to diſtinguiſh him from an Impoſtor,
a falſe Prophet, and the <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> Why
they will ſay perhaps</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1207700100:21"/>
1. That beſides Greatneſs of Power, there
was nothing but Goodneſs, Kindneſs, and
Love to Man-kind ſhewn in <hi>Jefus's</hi> Miracles.
As to the Miracles of falſe Prophets and
Impoſtors, if they be, many of them, of a
kind and benevolent Aſpect, yet the <hi>Devil's</hi>
Foot, if we look well to it, will diſcover it
ſelf in ſome ludicrous and miſcheivous
Pranks: But <hi>Jeſus's</hi> Miracles were all of a
beneficent Nature, He went about doing
good, healing all manner of Diſeaſes among
the People, and did no wrong to any one;
which is a good Argument they ſay, of
his Divine Authority, or God would not
have ſuffer'd, nor the Devil have work'd
ſuch a Teſtimony in behalf of it. On
this Head our <hi>Divines</hi> are copious and
rhetorical, and many notable and florid
Harangues have they made on it. But</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to them, they don't ſeem to
have their Memories at Hand, when they
declaim at this Rate. The Fathers, upon
whoſe Authority I write, will tell ſuch
Orators, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if his Miracles are to
be underſtood in the litteral ſence, did not
only as fooliſh Things, as any Impoſtor
could do, but very injurious ones to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
I ſhall not here inſtance in the
ſeemingly fooliſh and injurious things which
Jeſus did for Miracles, intending under the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1207700100:22"/>
next Head to ſpeak to ſome of them. But
they are ſuch, if litterally true, as out
Divines do believe, as are enough to turn
our ſtomachs againſt ſuch a Prophet; and
enough to make us take him for a <hi>Conjuror,</hi>
a <hi>Sorcerer</hi> and a <hi>Wizard</hi> rather, than the
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> and Prophet of the moſt High
God. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove the Meſſiahſhip of the
Holy Jeſus from his Miracles, our <hi>Divines</hi>
urge the Prophecys of the Old Teſtament,
ſuch as that of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> C. XXXV. v. 5, 6.
<hi>Then the Eyes of the blind ſhall be opened,
and the Ears of the Deaf ſhall be unſtopp'd,
then ſhall the lame Man leap as the Hart,
and the Tongue of the Dumb ſing</hi>; and ſay
that theſe Prophecys were accurately ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd
by our <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the ſeveral ſpecifical
Cures of Blindneſs, Deafneſs, Lameneſs
and Dumbneſs, which he often perform'd
upon one or other; and, in aſmuch as
our Saviour ſeems to appeal to ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecys,
do conclude this his Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them to be no leſs than a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>
that great Prophet, who was to came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World. To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Accompliſhment of
Prophecys that can neither be given forth
by human Foreſight, nor fulfill'd in a
Counterfeit, are good Proofs of <hi>Jeſus's</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1207700100:23"/>
                  <hi>Meſſiahſhip</hi>; But then, what ſhall we ſay
if others beſides <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould do the like
Cures and Miracles? It is ſaid of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi>
and I believe it, that he will
not only, do all the Miracles, that Jeſus
did, but will appeal to the like Prophecys
too. How then we are to diſtinguiſh the
true Chriſt from the falſe Chriſt by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and Prophecys in this Caſe, is the
Queſtion, which I leave with our Divines
to conſider of an Anſwer to, againſt the
Time, that it is proved that <hi>Antichriſt</hi>
does all thoſe Miracles, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the
Fleſh wrought. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The foreſaid Prophecys and
others mention'd in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> neither were,
nor could be Prophecys of the miraculous
Cures of bodily Diſeaſes which Jeſus <hi>then</hi>
did. And this may be made appear not
only from the Context of thoſe Prophecy's,
which received then no Accompliſhment
from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who ought to have fulfill'd one
Part of the Prophecy as well as the other,
or is not to be taken for the Fulfiller of
either; bur from the Opinion of both <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Fathers,</hi> who adjourn the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe Prophecys to Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Advent; But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the Place
above cited, ſpeaks not of bodily Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ
which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is to heal, but of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1207700100:24"/>
the ſpiritual Diſtempers of the Soul, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically
ſo call'd; as may be eaſily
proved, not only from the Prophecys
themſelves, but from the old <hi>Jews,</hi> who
were Allgorical Interpreters of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
and from the antient Fathers,

Prophecys, and to make his Cure of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

Spiritual Diſeaſes is the Proper and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Work of the true Meſſiah; for

               <p>II. I ſhall prove, that the litteral Story
of many of Jeſus's Miracles, as they are
recorded in the Evangeliſts and commonly
believed by Chriſtians, does imply Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities,
and Incredibilities and the
groſſeſt Abſuidities, very diſhonourable to
the Name of Chriſt; conſequently, they,
in Whole or in Part, were never wrought,
but are only related as Prophetical and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Naratives of what would be Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and more Wonderfully done by him.</p>
               <p>The reading of this Head will, I doubt
not, ſtrike with Horror, ſome of our
ſqueamiſh <hi>Divines,</hi> who, notwithſtanding
they will Sacrifice almoſt any Principles to
their Intereſt, will not bear that our Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Evangelical Hiſtory of ſuch renown'd
Miracles ſhould be thus call'd in Queſtion,
and contemptuouſly ſpoken of. What does
this <hi>Author</hi> mean, will ſome ſay, thus to
do ſervice to Atheiſm and Infidelity? Away
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1207700100:27"/>
with him! Our Indignation is moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him! No Cenſure and Puniſhment
can be too ſevere for ſuch Impiety, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs,
and Blaſphemy, as is aim'd at, and
imply'd in this Propoſition.</p>
               <p>To calm therefore the Spirits and abate
the Prejudices of ſuch Accuſers, I muſt
proceed with the greater Caution; and with
Reaſon and Authority well fortifie my ſelf
before and behind, or I ſhall feel the Weight
of the Diſpleaſure of our <hi>Divines,</hi> who are
prepoſſeſs'd of the Belief of the Litteral
Story of all Jeſus's Miracles.</p>
               <p>Before then I enter upon the particular
Examination of any of his Miracles, I will
premiſe two or three general Aſſertions of
the Fathers about them. And firſt <hi>Origen</hi>

of the writings of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi>

many Inſtances to this Purpoſe. St. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>

ſtudying Brevity, I think the three Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys
above enough to cool the Rage
and aſſuage the Prejudices of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
againſt the Propoſition before us,
which I now come to a particular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of, that is, to ſhew that the ſtory of
many of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles is literally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, improbable and incredible. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſpeak to that Miracle of Jeſus's
<hi>driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the</hi>

make Mention of.</p>
               <p>I have read in ſome modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whoſe Name dos not occur to my
Memory, that this was, in his Opinion,
the moſt ſtupendous Miracle, that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
wrought. And in truth it was a moſt
aſtoniſhing one, if literally true, and <hi>Jeſus</hi>
muſt appear more than a Man, he muſt
put on an awful and moſt Majeſtick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to effect it. It is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how any one in the Form of a Man,
and of a deſpiſed one too, (and we don't
read that <hi>Jeſus</hi> chang'd his human ſhape)
with a Whip in his Hand could execute
ſuch a Work upon a great Multitude of
People; who were none of his Diſciples,
nor had any regard for him. ſuppoſing he
could, by his divine Power infuſe a <hi>Pannick</hi>
Fear into the People; yet what was the
Reaſon, that he was ſo <hi>eaten up</hi> with zeal
againſt the Profanation of that Houſe,
which he himſelf came to deſtroy, and
which he permitted, I may ſay command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be filthily polluted not long after.
Put not to form by my ſelf an lnvective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the letter of this Story, let's hear what
the Fathers ſay to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1207700100:30"/>
                  <hi>Origen</hi> makes the whole but a <note n="25" place="bottom">In Comment: in Matt. C. xxi.</note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
His allegorical Expositions of it
are frequent; and one time or other he
gives us the myſtical meaning of every
Part of it. By the Temple he underſtands
the Church. By the ſellers in the Temple,
he means ſuch Preachers, who make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
of the Goſpel, whom the Spirit
of Chriſt ſome Time or other would rid
his Church of. He is ſo far from believing
any Thing of the Letter of this Story, that
he has form'd a <note n="26" place="bottom">Porro cui curae eſt accuratior Inquiſitio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderabit, an juxta dignitatem praeſentis Vitae erat, ut Jeſus rem talem auderet facere, extrudere vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet Mercatorum Multiudinem, qui ad Diem feſtum aſcenderant, Diſtributuri boves ditioribus, et tanto populo oves mactandas per domos familiarium, quae multorum millium complerent numerum; atque eos qui in rebus talibus gloriantes producturi erant in medio Columbas, quas multi empturi erant, ceu in Conventu celeberrimo convivaturi. Conſiderabit hic etiam, an Nummulariorum erat non accuſare Jeſum contumelioſe propter ſuas ipſorum effuſas pecunias et menſas ſubverſas. Quis antem flagello e funiculis verberatus et expulſus ab eo, qui penes eos habebatur vilis, hunc adortus non inclamaſſet totis viribus ſeſe ulciſcens? Cum praeſertim haberet tantam multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem eorum, qui ſibi aeque contumeliam fieri credebant, faventem ſibi adverſum Jeſum? Inſuper cenſideremus, Dei filium funiculos ſumentem; ſibique flagellum tenentem ad extrudendum e templo, annon reprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentet Praeter audaciam &amp; temeritatem, inordinatum etiam quiddam? In <hi>Johan.</hi> Tom. XI.</note> large Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it: The ſubſtance of which is, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1207700100:31"/>
if Jeſus had attempted any ſuch Thing,
the People would have reſiſted, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
their Revenge on him; If he had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it, the Merchants of the Temple
might have reproach'd him with Damage
done to their Wares; and would have juſtly
accuſed him of a Riot againſt Law and
Authority. Whether there is not Reaſon
in this Argument of <hi>Origen,</hi> let any one
judge.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Hilary</hi> is of the ſame Mind with <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi>
He ſays that this Story is only a <note n="27" place="bottom">Praefiguratio futurorum dictis praeſentibus continetur. In Matt. C. xxi.</note> 
Praefiguration of what will be done in
Chriſt's Church upon another Occaſion. And
he admoniſhes <note n="28" place="bottom">Admonemur altius Verborum Virtutes in iſtius modi ſignificationibus contuendas, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> us to ſearch into the
profound and myſtical Import of every Part
of it. Particularly he hints that <note n="29" place="bottom">In Cathedra eſt ſacordotii ſedes; et eorum qui Spiritus ſancti Donum Venale habent, Cathedras evertet. Ibid.</note> by
the Seats of thoſe, who ſell Doves, may
be underſtood the Pulpits of Preachers,
who make ſale of the Gifts of the Spirit,
which is repreſented by a Dove. As to the
Letter of the Story, he is plain enough,
that there was no ſuch <note n="30" place="bottom">Non habebant Judaei quod venire poſſent, neque erat quod emere quis poſſet. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> Market kept
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1207700100:32"/>
in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and if any
Hiſtorians beſides the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> had
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it, I know of none, who would have
been ſo fooliſh as to believe, that Oxen
and Sheep and Goats were there ſold.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> too is for the Myſtery and
againſt the Letter of this Story, ſaying,
 <note n="31" place="bottom">Cathedra autem Vendentium Columbas cur everterit? ſecundum Litteram non intellgo. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet. Typo ejectorum de Templo hujuſmodi Mercatorum, in Eccleſia Dei Couſortium eos habere non poſſe, qui ſancti Spiritus Gratiam nundinentur. <hi>In Loc. Luc.</hi>
                  </note> what ſhould be the Reaſon that Jeſus
ſhould overturn the Seats of thoſe that ſold
Doves? This muſt be, ſays he, a Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Story, and ſignifies nothing leſs than
the future Ejection of Prieſts out of his
Church, who ſhall make Gain and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> as his manner is in other
Caſes, firſt gives us a Litteral Expoſition
of this Miracle, as far as it will bear it:
But then corrects himſelf again, ſaying,
there are <note n="32" place="bottom">Juxta ſimplicem Intelligentim—quod pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus abſurdum—caeterum ſecundum Myſticos In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus Jeſus ingreditur Templum Patris et ejicit omnes Epiſcopos, Presbyteros et Diaconos, &amp;c. <hi>In Loc. Mat.</hi>
                  </note> Abſurditys in the Letter;
but, according to its Myſtical Meaning,
Jeſus will enter his Temple of the Church,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1207700100:33"/>
and caſt out of it Biſhops, Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
who make a Trade of Preaching.
and in another Place he tells us of the
Myſtical <note n="33" place="bottom">Faciet Dominus Flagellum de Scripturarum Textuum Teſtinoniis. <hi>In Zechar:</hi> C. xiv.</note> Whip, that Jeſus will make uſe of to this Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> alſo is againſt the Letter
of the Story of this Miracle ſaying, <note n="34" place="bottom">Non magnum Peccatum, ſi hoc vendebant in Templo, quod emebatur, ut offerretur in Templo. <hi>In Loc. Johan.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>where could be the great Sin of ſelling
and buying things in the Temple, that were
for the Uſe of it, and offer'd as Sacrifice in
it?</hi> We muſt therefore, ſays he look for
the Myſtery in this <note n="35" place="bottom">Qui ſunt tamen qui boves vendunt? ut in figura quaeramus Myſterium facti. qui ſunt qui Oves vendunt et Columbas? ipſi ſunt qui ſua quaerunt in Eccleſia, non quae Jeſu Chriſti. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> Figurative Story,
and enquire what is ment by the Oxen and
Sheep and Doves, and who are the ſellers
of them in Chriſt's Church; and he is very
poſitive that Eccleſiaſticks, who are ſelfiſh
and make Worldly Gain of the Goſpel,
are here meant. And as to the Expreſſion
of turning the Temple into a Den of
Theives, he ſays it has Reſpect: to the <note n="36" place="bottom">Vox enim feciſtis Domum meum, Domum Negotiationis etſpeluncam Latronum, ſignificat fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turos in Eccleſia. L. ii. <hi>Evang. Quaeſt. Quaſt.</hi> 48.</note> 
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1207700100:34"/>
Clergy in Time to come, who would make
ſuch a Den of Chriſt's Church.</p>
               <p>Laſtly with the foregoing Fathers agrees
St. <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who is, an Allegoriſt too
upon this Miracle, ſaying that thoſe, <note n="37" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>In Johan.</hi> C. ii.</note> 
who ſell Doves, are the Prieſts, who ſell
Spiritual Gifts, and that Chriſt ſometime
or other would overturn their Seats, and
clear his Church of them. In another Place
he intimates, what are meant by Oxen
and Sheep, <hi>viz.</hi> the litteral Sence of the
Scriptures. And if the litteral Sence be
irrational and nonſenſical, the Metaphor we
muſt allow to be proper, in as much as
now-a-days, dull and fooliſh and abſurd
ſtuff we call Bulls, Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lings and Blunders.</p>
               <p>Behold a wonderful Harmony among the
Fathers in their Rejection of litteral
and eſpouſal of the myſtical Senſe of this
Miracle. It is ſaid of the Church in her firſt
Ages, that ſhe was inſpir'd; and ſo ſhe
was, or, before an Hire for the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
was eſtabliſhed, and pleaded for, ſhe
could never have written in this faſhion.
If the Fathers had lived now, and written
thus, we ſhould have thought the Spirit
of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> was gotten amongſt them,
or they would never have given ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1207700100:35"/>
of this Story of favour an Enmity
to an Hireling Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>How and when Chriſ'sts Power according
to the Figure and Parable before us, will
enter his Church, and drive out of her theſe
Eccleſiaſtical Merchants, is not the Queſtion.
But when ever it dos ſo effectually, it will
be a ſtupendous Miracle, Much greater
than the Typical one is ſuppoſed to be,
and not only a Proof of Chriſt's divine
Power and Preſence in his Church, but an
abſolute Demonſtration of his <hi>Meſſiahſhip,</hi>
from his Accompliſhment both of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Prophecys of the Fathers, and of other
remarkable Ones of the Old Teſtament,
which will be then clearly underſtood, and
which it is not my Buſineſs here to apply
or mention.</p>
               <p>Againſt the aforeſaid Expoſition of this
Miracle perhaps it may be Objected, that
(excepting a little Reaſoning againſt the
Letter of it) this is only the chimerical and
whimſical Dream of the Fathers, whoſe
Notions are obſolete, and who <note n="38" place="bottom">Chandler's Vindication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 145.</note> 
                  <hi>have
adulterated Chriſtianity with their Cant and
Jargan,</hi> and that none of our Proteſtant and
Orthodox <hi>Divines</hi> have ever given into their Opinion.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, that that none of our Proteſtant
<hi>Divines,</hi> whom I know, do embrace the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1207700100:36"/>
foreſaid Expoſition of the Fathers, but it
may be nothing the worſe for all that:
And tho' their Expoſition may be very
diſagreeable to the Prieſthood of this Age;
yet I can tell them of the greateſt Man
of theſe laſt Ages, and that was <hi>Eraſmus,</hi>
who, cautiouſly expreſſing himſelf for fear
of giving Offence to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> is of the
ſame Mind with the Fathers; or he would
not ſay that <note n="39" place="bottom">Hoc facto longe aliud ſignificabat Jeſus, nec enim illum tantopere commovebat Templum illud mercimoniis Boum, Ovium, Hircorum et Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum profanatum; ſed oftendere voluit Avaritiam et Quaeſtum fore capitalem Peſtem Eccleſiae, quam Templum, cujus Religio mox erat abolenda, figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat—In nullum Hominum Genus acrius ſaeviit Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſed hos ipſe ſibi ſervavit ejiciendos, cum videbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>In Loc. Matt.</hi> C. xxi.</note> 
                  <hi>that Work of Jeſus did
prefigure ſomewhat elſe. For Jeſus could not
be zealous againſt the Profanation of that
Temple of the Jews, which was ſoon to be
deſtroy'd but meant to ſhew his diſlike and
hatred of Eccleſiaſtical Covetouſneſs, which,
after the Way of the Type, he would take his
Opportunity to rid the Church of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I diſmiſs this Miracle I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that if the Fathers are right above,
then out <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Tranſlations
of the place in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> err in a main
Point. Inſtead of reading, <hi>and Jeſus caſt
out them, that ſold and bought,</hi> it ſhould be,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1207700100:37"/>
                  <hi>thoſe who ſold and preach'd,</hi> that is, ſold
what they preach'd. For the Word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
do's more properly ſignifie to <hi>preach</hi> than
to <hi>buy</hi>; and in this ſenſe here, according
to the Fathers, it ſhould be conſtrued.</p>
               <p>Again, I muſt obſerve, that our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
are a little perplex'd to know
who and what thoſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Money-Changers</hi>

old Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
But it is very agreeable to our

                  <hi>Pulpits,</hi> who can help it?</p>
               <p>So much then on the Miracle of Jeſus's
driving the Sellersand Buyers out of the
Temple. And now I appeal to our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
whether it be not an abſurd, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
and incredible Story according
to the Letter, and whether it be any other,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1207700100:38"/>
than, as the Fathers ſaid of it, a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and parabolical Narative of what
would be myſteriouſly and more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
done by Jeſus. And ſo I come to
ſpeak to a</p>
               <p n="2">2. Second Miracle of Jeſus, and that is, that
of his <note n="42" place="bottom">Matt. C. viii. Mark C. v. Luke C. viii.</note> 
                  <hi>casting the Devils out of the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or Madmen, and permitting them to
enter into the Herd of Swine, which thereupon
ran down a Precipice and were all choaked
in the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To exorciſe or caſt Devils out of the
Poſſeſs'd, without conſidering the Nature
of ſuch a Poſſeſſion, or the Nature and
Power of the Devil, we'll allow to be not
only a kind and beneficent Act, but a
great Miracle. But then, be the Miracle
as great as can be imagin'd, it is no more,
than what falſe Teachers, <note n="43" place="bottom">Luke C. xiii. v. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Workers of
Iniquity,</hi> and even ſome Artiſts amongſt
the <hi>Jews</hi> have before done, conſequently
ſuch a Work of <hi>Exorciſm</hi> in our Saviour
could be no Proof of his Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And if there was no more to be
ſaid againſt this Miracle; this is enough
to ſet it aſide, and to ſpoil the Argument
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Divine Power from it. But
there are many Circumſtances in the Story
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1207700100:39"/>
litterally conſider'd, that would induce us
to call the Truth of the Whole into Queſtion.
How came thoſe Madmen to have their
dwelling amongſt the Tombs of a Burying
Ground? where was the Humanity of the
People, that did not take Care of them
in Pitty to them, as well as for the Safety
of others? Or if no Chains, as the Text
ſays, which is hardly credible, could hold
them, it was poſſible ſurely as well as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to diſpatch them, rather than their
Neighbours and Paſſengers ſhould be in
Danger from them. Believe then this Part
of the Story who can? But what's worſe,
its not credible, there was any Herd of
<hi>Swine</hi> in that Country. If any Hiſtorians
but the <hi>Evangiliſts</hi> has ſaid ſo, none would
have believed it. The <hi>Jews</hi> are forbidden
to eat Swines Fleſh; what then ſhould they
do with Swine which are good for nothing
till they are dead) who eat neither Pigg,
Pork nor Bacon? Some may ſay that they
were kept there for the Uſe of Strangers:
But this could not be; becauſe that after
the Time of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who polluted the
Temple with the Sacrifice of an Hog, the
<hi>Jews</hi> 
                  <note n="44" place="bottom">Spencer. de Legibus Hebrae.p.117.</note> forbid, under the Pain of an
<hi>Anathema,</hi> the keeping of any Swine in their
Country. Perhaps is may be ſaid, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1207700100:40"/>
the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> ſo call'd from the Place of
their Abode, were not <hi>Jews</hi> but neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> with whom it was lawful to
eat, and keep <hi>Swine.</hi> We will ſuppoſe ſo,
tho' it is improbable; but then, it's unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(without better Reaſon than at preſent
we are appriſed of) that our Saviour would
permit the Devils to enter into a Herd of
them to their Deſtruction. Where was
the Goodneſs and Juſtice of his ſo doing?
Let our <hi>Divines</hi> account for it, if they can.
It is commonly ſaid of our Saviour, and I
believe it, that his Life was entirely Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
that his Miracles were all uſeful and
beneficial to Maniind, and that he did no
Wrong to any one. But how can this be
rightly ſaid of him, if this Story be litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
true? The Proprietors of the Swine
were great Loſers and Sufferers; and we
don't read that <hi>Jeſus</hi> make them amends,
or that they deſerv'd ſuch Uſage from him.
The Proprietors of the Swine, it ſeems, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Damage done them by <hi>Jeſus.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
him to depart out of their Coaſts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
farther Miſchief, which was gentler
Reſentment, than we can imagine any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would have made of the like Injury.
I know not what our Divines think of this
Part of the Story, nor wherefore Jeſus
eſcaped ſo well; but if any <hi>Exorciſt</hi> in this
our Age and Nation had pretended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1207700100:41"/>
the Devil out of one poſſeſs'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to enter into a Flock of Sheep,
the People would have ſaid, that he had
bewitch'd both; and our Laws and Judges
too of the laſt Age, would have made him
to ſwing for it.</p>
               <p>Without Offence, I hope, I have argued
againſt the Letter of this ſtrange Story of
the Holy Jeſus; I ſhould not have dared
to have ſaid ſo much againſt it, but upon
the Encouragement of <hi>Origen</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who ſay, we ought to expoſe the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
of the Letter, as much as may
be, to turn Men's Heads to the myſtical and
true meaning.</p>
               <p>Let's hear then, what the Fathers ſay to
this Miracle. <hi>Origen</hi>'s Commentaries on
this Part of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s
Goſpel are loſt; otherwiſe unqueſtionably
he would not only have told us, that he
believed no more of the Letter of this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
than he did of the Devil's <note n="45" place="bottom">L. IV. <hi>De Principiis.</hi>
                  </note> taking
our Saviour to the Top of a Mountain,
and ſhewing him all the Kingdoms of the

would have given us curious Light

of the Letter</hi> are included, <note n="52" place="bottom">Littera eſt Palea, &amp; frequenter evenit, ut ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines hujus ſoeculi myſtica neſcientes, ſimplici Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turarum Lectione paſcuntur. <hi>Hieron. in</hi> Iſa. c. xi.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1207700100:44"/>
part, and to conſider, whether there's not
a Neceſſity for ſuch an Interpretation to
make the Story credible.</p>
               <p>And thus have I given you the Opinion
and Expoſition of the Fathers upon this
Miracle, which they turn all into Myſtery.
If our <hi>Divines</hi> are ſtill for adhering to the
Letter of this Story, let them Account for
the Difficulties, it is involv'd with. To
cure Men violently diſtracted, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
with <hi>Devils</hi> is, whether it be mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
or not, a good and great Work;
but to ſend the <hi>Devils,</hi> who without <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s
Permiſſion could not go, into the
<hi>Herd of Swine,</hi> was an Injury done to the
Proprietors, and unbecoming of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Holy Jeſus. Neither is there
any other Way to ſolve the Difficulty,
than by looking upon the Whole, with
the Fathers, as Type and Figure.</p>
               <p>If this Miraculous Story had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and not of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; our
<hi>Divines,</hi> I dare ſay, would have work'd
it up to a Confutation, of <hi>Mahometaniſm.
Mahomet</hi> ſhould have been, with them,
nothing leſs than a Wizard, an Enchanter,
a dealer with familiar Spirits, a ſworn ſlave
to the Devil; and his <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> would
have been hard put to it to write a good
Defence of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1207700100:45"/>
When our Saviour was brought before
<hi>Pilate</hi> to be arraign'd, try'd, and condem'd,
<hi>Pilate</hi> put this Queſtion to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaying
<hi>what evil hath Jeſus done</hi>? If both or either
of the Stories above had been litterally
true of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> there had been no need of
falſe Witneſſes againſt him. The Merchants
of the Temple were at hand, who could
have ſworn "that he was the Author of
an Uproar, and Riot, the like was never
ſeen on their Market-day; that they were
great Sufferers and Loſers in their Trades;
and, whether he or his Party had ſtolen
any of their Goods or not, yet ſome
were embezzled and others damag'd;
and all through the outragious Violence
of this unruly Fellow againſt Law and
Authority," If ſuch Evidence as this
was not enough to convict him of a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Crime; then the <hi>Swine-Herds</hi> of the
<hi>Gadarenes</hi> might have depoſed, how they
"believed him to be a <hi>Wizard</hi> and had
loſt two thouſand Swine through his
Falcinations. That he bid the Divels
to go into our Cattle is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd.
And if he cured one or two of
our Countrymen of a violent Poſſeſſion;
yet in as much as he did us this Injury
in our Swine, we juſtly ſuſpect him of
Diabolical Practiſes upon both."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1207700100:46"/>
Upon ſuch Evidence as this, <hi>Pilate</hi> asks
the Opinion of Jews, ſaying, <hi>what think
you</hi>? If they all had condemn'd him to
be guilty of Death, it is no wonder, ſince
there is not a <hi>Jury</hi> in <hi>England</hi> would
have acquitted any one arraign'd and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
in the like Caſe.</p>
               <p>It is well for our litteral <hi>Doctors,</hi> that
ſuch Accuſations were not brought againſt
<hi>Jeſus</hi>; or their Heads would have been
ſadly puzzled to vindicate his Innocence,
and to prove the Injuſtice and Undeſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Death and Sufferings. But
for this Reaſon, if no other, that no ſuch
Crimes were laid to his Charge, I believe
little or nothing of either of the ſeemingly
miraculous Storys before us; but look upon
them both, as Prophetical and Parabolical
Narratives of what would myſteriouſly and
more wonderfully, and conſiſtently with
the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> be done
by him. And ſo I paſs to a</p>

this is the darkeſt and blindeſt Story of the

whether the Conceptions of any two
thinking <hi>Doctors</hi> do agree about it. To ſay
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1207700100:47"/>
there is nothing in the Letter of this Story,
we Believers muſt not; becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note n="54" place="bottom">ii Peter Cap. i. v. 16, 17, 18.</note> ſays, he was an Eye-witneſs of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Majeſty, ſaw his Glory on the Mount, and
heard the Voice out of the Cloud. But as
Infidels will be prying into the Conduct of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Life and forming their Exceptions
to the Credibility or Probability of this or
that Part of it; ſo we Chriſtians ſhould
be ready at an Anſwer, that might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
ſatisfy them; and not forcibly bear
down their Oppoſition, which will make
no ſincere Converts of them. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they would eaſily diſtreſs us with
Difficultys and Objections to the Letter
of this Story.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelf <note n="55" place="bottom">Poſſunt Infideles iſtam Vocem delatam de Caelo, per conjecturas humanas et illicitas Curioſitates ad magicas Artes referre. <hi>In Sermon.</hi> xliii. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5.</note> owns, that the
whole of it might be perform'd by Magic
Art; And we know, in theſe our Days
that ſome Jugglers are ſtrange Artiſts at

too into different forms and ſhapes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Miracle, to the Surpriſe and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of ſpectators.</p>
               <p>But what, I trow, do our <hi>Divines</hi> mean
by <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s <hi>Transfiguration.</hi> We read that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1207700100:48"/>
his Countenance did ſhine like the Sun,
and his Rayment was made as white as
Snow, and that's all. And is this enough
can we think to demonſtrate that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
a Miraclous <hi>Transfiguration?</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
will tell us, that the Reflections
of the Light of the Sun will change the
Appearance of Colours, and to none more
than whiteneſs; And <hi>Sceptics</hi> will ſay that
its no wonder if the Countenance of Jeſus
look'd <hi>Rubicund</hi> when the Sun might ſhine
on it.</p>
               <p>The Word in the Original for transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, he was meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed,
transform'd or if you will
transfigured. And what is to be underſtood
by a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> we are to learn not only
from the natural Import of the Word but
from the ancient uſe of it. Accordingly
it ſignifies nothing leſs than the Change
or Transformation of a Perſon into the
Forms, Shapes and Eſſences of Creatures
and Things of a quite different Species,
Size and Figure. But <hi>Jeſus,</hi> it is conceived,
was not ſo <hi>transfigured.</hi> Our Divines, I
ſuppoſe would not have him thought ſuch
a <hi>Poſture-Maſter</hi> for the whole World. If
I or any one elſe ſhould aſſert, that Jeſus
upon the Mount transform'd himſelf into
a Calf, a Lyon, a Bear, a Ram, a Goat,
an Hydra, a Stone, a Tree, and into many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1207700100:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other things of the animate and inanimate
World, I dare ſay there would, among our
Orthodox Divines, be ſuch Exclamations
againſt me for Blaſphemy, as the like were
never heard of. They, to be ſure will not
hear of ſuch a Transfiguration; nor, like good
plain Believers, will bear any thing more
than that Jeſus's <hi>Countenance did ſhine</hi> like
the Sun, and the Colour of his Countenance
was changed; which whether it comes up
to the import of a <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> or not,
they dont care.</p>
               <p>But to cloſe with our Divines, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that the glorious Change of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Countenance, and of the Colour of
his Veſtments was a true and proper Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiguration,
and that it was as real and
wonderful a Miracle as could be wrought;
But then we may, I hope, ask them, what
was the particular Reaſon and Uſe of this
Miracle? Was it a Miracle only for the
ſake of a Miracle? That's an Abſurdity in

Uſe of this Miracle? Of that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Hiſtory is ſilent; and our Divines
with all their Reaſoning Facultys can ſay
nothing to it.</p>
               <p>And what did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> on the
Mount with Jeſus? was it in their own
proper Perſons that they appear'd? or were
they only ſome Specters and Apparitions
in Reſemblance of them? It is ſaid, that
they were talking with <hi>Jeſus</hi>; what then
did they talk about? The three greateſt
Prophets and Philoſophers of the Univerſe
could not poſſibly meet and confer together,
but on the moſt ſublime, uſeful, and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Subject. It's ſtrange, that the Apoſtles,
who over-heard their Confabulation, did
not make a Report of it, and tranſmit it to
Poſterity for our Edification and Inſtruction.
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation has it,
ſeems to ſay that they talk'd together of
Jeſus's <hi>Deceaſe which he ſhould accompliſh

in the dark, as to the Subject, that
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with Jeſus about.</p>
               <p>But further, why could not this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
have been wrought in the Valley as
well as upon a Mountain, whither Jeſus
and his three Apoſtles aſcended for the
Work of it? Naughty Infidels will ſay, it
was for the Advantage of a Cloud, which
often moves and reſts on the Tops of
Mountains, to diſplay his Pranks in. And
why was it not done in the Preſence of
the Multitude, as well as of his three A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſtles?
The more Witneſſes of a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the better it is atteſted, and the more
reaſonably Credited; and there could not
ſurely be too many Witneſſes of this, any
more than of others of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles, if
real ones. Ought not the unbelieving
Multitude, for many Unbelievers unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably
were amongſt them, to have had
a Sight and Hearing of this Miracle, as
well as the Apoſtles? Who ſhould rather
ſee the Miracle, than thoſe who wanted
Conviction? Were they to take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Miracle upon the Word of
the Apoſtles, who were Partys in the

               <p>After this Faſhion do the Fathers, one or
other of them, Copiouſly Treat on every
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1207700100:55"/>
Part of this Transfiguration of Jeſus. I
could collect an almoſt infinite Number of
Paſſages out of their Writings to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
But from theſe few it is plain, they
look'd on the Story of Chriſt's Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but as a Figure and Parable; and
they were certainly in the right on't, in as
much as this their Senſe of the Matter and
no other, will ſolve the Difficultys before
ſtarted againſt the Letter, as any one may
diſcern if he attentively review and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
one with the other; As for Inſtance;
this their Senſe and Interpretation lets us
into the Reaſon of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias's</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
on the Mount with Jeſus; and
gives us to underſtand what they talk'd
about, and that was, not on Jeſus's <hi>Deceaſe
which he would accompliſh at Jeruſalem,</hi> as
our Tranſlation has it, but on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the old Teſtament; particularly,
as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, on Moſe's <hi>Book of Exodus,</hi>
                  <hi>and how he would fulfill it</hi> at the New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
               <p>Whether any, beſides my ſelf, do's really
apprehended and is willing to underſtand this
Story of Chriſt's Transfiguration, as I do, I
neither know nor care. I am not bound to
find others, Ears, Eyes, and Capacitys. What
I have ſaid is enough to ſhew the Senſe of
the Fathers about this Matter. If any diſlike
their concurrent Opinions of Jeſus's Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuraton's
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1207700100:56"/>
being an Emblem, an Enigma,
and Figurative Repreſentation of a Future
and moſt Glorious Transfiguration, ſuch a
one as they ſpeak of; let him account for
the Difficultys and Objections, which I have
before raiſed againſt the Letter of this Story.
In the mean Time I ſhall think it, litterally,
an abſurd, improbable, and incredible one,
and no other than a Prophetical and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Narrative of what will be Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and more wonderfully done by <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have conſider'd Three of the
Miracles of our Saviour, and ſhewn how
they are Abſurdities, according to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
conſequently do make nothing for his
Authority and Meſſiahſhip. I can and will
do as much by his other Miracles; for I
would not have any one think, I am got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the End of my Tedder, but for ſome
Reaſons beſt known to my ſelf, I publiſh
theſe Remarks on theſe three firſt. After the
Clergy have chew'd upon theſe a while, I
will take into Examination ſome others of
<hi>Jeſus's</hi> Miracles, which for their litteral Story
are admired by them. As for Inſtance
I will take to task his Miracle <note n="65" place="bottom">John Cap. ii.</note> 
                  <hi>of
changing Water into Wine at a Marriage in
Cana of Galilee</hi>; which was the beginning of
<hi>Jeſus's</hi> Miracles, and ſhould by right have
been firſt ſpoken to; but I am almoſt too
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1207700100:57"/>
grave to handle the Letter of this Story as I
ought; and if I had treated it as ludicrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it deſerves, I don't know, but at ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out, I ſhould have put the <hi>Clergy</hi> quite
out of all Temper I would not now for the
World be ſo impious and prophane, as to
believe, with out <hi>Divines,</hi> what is contain'd
and imply'd in the Letter of this Story. If
<hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> and not <hi>Jeſus,</hi> had been
the Author of this Miracle, we ſhould often
have reproached his Memory with it. It
is ſaid of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> that a Table
was all on a ſudden, at his Command, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
ſpread with variety of nice Diſhes
for the Entertainment of himſelf and his
Gueſts; which Miracle, our <hi>Divines</hi> can
tell him makes not at all to his Credit, in
as much as it was done for the ſervice and
pleaſure of luxurious Appetites. But if <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi>
had done, as our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did at this
Wedding, they would have ſaid much
worſe of him; and that modeſtly ſpeaking,
he delighted to make his Friends thoroughly
merry, or he would not be at the Pains of
a Miracle to turn ſo much Water into
Wine, after they had before <hi>well drank.</hi>
If the Fathers then don't help us out at
the myſtical and true meaning of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
ſuch farther Objections may be
form'd againſt the Letter, as may make
our Divines aſham'd of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1207700100:58"/>
I will alſo take into Examination <hi>Jeſus's</hi>
Miracles <note n="66" place="bottom">Matt. c. xiv. and xv, &amp;c.</note> of <hi>feeding many thouſands in
the Wilderneſs with a few Loaves and Fiſhes,</hi>
which according to the Letter are moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
Tales. I don't in the leaſt queſtion
<hi>Jeſus's</hi> Power to magnifie or multiply the
Loaves, and, if he pleas'd to meliorate the
Bread. But that many thouſands of Men,
Women and Children ſhould follow him
into the Wilderneſs, and ſtay with him
three Days and Nights too, without eating,
is a little againſt Senſe and Reaſon. Whether
the Wilderneſs was near to, or far from
the Peoples Habitations, the difficultys at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the Story are equally great. I
wonder how <hi>Jeſus</hi> amuſed them all the
while, that they had the Patience to ſtay
with him without Food; But I much more
wonder, that no Victualers beſides the <hi>Lad</hi>
with his Loaves and Fiſhes, of whom, and
his Occupation, whether it was that of a
<hi>Baker</hi> or <hi>Fiſhmonger</hi>; and of his neglect of
his Maſter's Buſineſs here; and of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that he met with no hungry Chapmen
for his Bread before, we ſhall make ſome
Enquiry; but particurly why he alone, I
ſay, and no other Victualers, no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talers
of Cakes and Gingerbread followed
the Camp. In ſhort, for all the imaginary
greatneſs of the Miracle (which there is a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1207700100:59"/>
way to reduce and leſſen) of Jeſus's feeding
his thouſands with a few Loaves, there muſt
be ſome Faſcination or Enchantment (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by the Laws of the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as
of other Nations) in the Matter; or the
People, if they had ſtay'd one Day, would
not two, much leſs three <hi>to faint,</hi> but
would, eſpecially the Women and Children
have been for returning, the firſt Night,
home. We muſt then ſeek to the Fathers
(who ſay the five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> are the five
Barley Loaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſeptiform'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the ſeven Loaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for a good No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Miracle, and if they don't make
it a Parable; do what our Divines can, it
will turn to the diſhonour of the Holy Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I will alſo conſider the Miracle of Jeſus's
 <note n="67" place="bottom">Mark Cap. ii. Luke C. v.</note> 
                  <hi>curing the Man ſick of the Palſy, for
whom the Roof of the Houſe was broken
up, to let him down into the Room where
Jeſus was, becauſe his Bearers could not enter
in at the Door for the Preſs of the People.</hi>
This Litterally is ſuch a <hi>Rodomontado,</hi> that
were Men to ſtretch, for a wager, againſt
Reaſon and Truth, none could out-doe it.
Where was the Humanity of the People,
and wherefore did they ſo tumultuate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Door of the Houſe? It's
<hi>ſtrange</hi> they had not ſo much Compaſſion
on the <hi>Paralytick,</hi> as to give Way to him:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1207700100:60"/>
It's <hi>more ſtrange,</hi> that his Bearers could get
to the Top of the Houſe with him and
his Bed too, when they could not get to
the Door, nor the Sides of it: It's <hi>yet
ſtranger,</hi> that the good Man of the Houſe
would ſuffer his Houſe to be broken up,
when it could not be long, 'ere the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
of the People would be appeas'd:
But moſt <hi>ſtrange,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who could
drive his thouſands out of the Temple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and draw as many after him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Wilderneſs, did not, by Force or
Perſwaſion, make the People to retreat, but
that ſuch needleſs Trouble and Pains muſt
be taken for the miraculous Cure of this
poor Man. Let's think of theſe Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Time, that out of the Fathers I
prove this Story to be a Parable.</p>
               <p>I will alſo take into Conſideration the
Miracle of <hi>Jeſus's</hi> curing <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="68" place="bottom">John Cap. ix.</note> 
                  <hi>Blind
Man, for whom Eye-Salve was made of Clay
and Spittle</hi>; which Eye-Salve, whether it
was balſamick or not, do's equally affect
the Credit of the Miracle. If it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
medicinal, there's an End of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
and if it was not at all medicinal,
it was fooliſhly and impertinently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
and can be no otherwiſe accounted
for, than by conſidering it, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as a figurative Act in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1207700100:61"/>
I will alſo take into Conſideration the
ſeveral Stories of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s raiſing of the dead;
and, without queſtioning his actual bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Dead to Life again, will prove
from the Circumſtances of thoſe Storys,
that they are parabotical, and are not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
to be apply'd to the Proof of Jeſus<hi>'s</hi>
Divine Authority and Meſſiahſhip; or, for
Inſtance, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he raiſed <hi>Jarius's</hi> 
                  <note n="69" place="bottom">Mark. Cap. v.</note> 
Daughter from the dead, would never have
turned the People out of the Houſe, who
ſhould have been his beſt and propereſt Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>I will alſo Conſider the Miracle of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus'<hi>s</hi>
                  <note n="70" place="bottom">Matt. Cap. xxi. Mark. Cap. xi.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſing the Fig-Tree,</hi> for its not
bearing Fruit out of Seaſon; which, upon
the bare mention of it, appears to be a
fooliſh, abſurd, and ridiculous Act, if not
figurative.</p>
               <p>I will alſo conſider the <note n="71" place="bottom">Matt. Cap. ii.</note> Journey of the
Wiſemen out of the Eaſt, with their (litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally)
ſenſeleſs and ridiculous Preſents of
<hi>Frankincence</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe</hi> to a new-born
Babe. If with their <hi>Gold,</hi> which could be but
little, they had brought their Dozens of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
Soap, and Candles, which would have
been of uſe to the Child and his poor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Straw, they had acted like
wiſe as well as good Men. But what, I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1207700100:62"/>
pray, was the Meaning and Reaſon of a
Star, like a <hi>Will a Whiſp,</hi> for their Guide
to the Place, where the Holy Infant lay.
Could not God by Divine Impulſe, in a
Viſion or in a Dream, as he ordered their
Return Home, have ſent them on this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Errand; but that a Star muſt be
taken or made out of Courſe to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
I wonder what Communication paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
between theſe Wiſe Men and the Star,
or how they came to know one another's
Uſe and Intention. But the Fathers ſhall
ſpeak hereafter farther to the ſenſeleſneſs
of this Story litterally; and make out the
Myſtery and true meaning of it.</p>
               <p>I will alſo, by the Leave of our <hi>Divines,</hi>
take again into Conſideration the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
and the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the
Dead. I do believe, if it may ſo pleaſe
our <hi>Divines,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born of a
pure Virgin, and that he aroſe from the
Dead; but ſpeaking too briefly, in the
<hi>Moderator,</hi> to theſe two Miracles, they took
Offence. I will therefore give them a
Review, and ſpeak Home to them; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to Chriſt's Reſurrection, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Story of which litterally, is
ſuch a Complication of Abſurditys, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherences,
and Contradictions, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Fathers can help us to a better
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1207700100:63"/>
Underſtanding of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> than we
have at preſent, we muſt of Neceſſity give
up the Belief of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many <note n="72" place="bottom">Alia quam plurima his ſimilia in Evangeliis inveniet, quicunque attentius legerit. <hi>Origen. de Principiis,</hi> L. iv.</note> other of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
and miraculous Parts of Jeſus's
Life, will I take into Examination, and
ſhew, that none of them litterally do
prove his Divine Authority, ſo far from
it, that they are full of Abſurdities, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities
and Incredibilities; but that
his whole Life in the Fleſh, is but <note n="73" place="bottom">Quae Enarratio erit Evangelii ſenſibilis, niſi accommodetur ad intelligibile &amp; ſpirituale? Nulla ſane. <hi>Origen. in Praefat. ad Johan. Evang.</hi>
                  </note> 
Type, Figure and Parable of his myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and ſpiritual Life and Operations in
Mankind.</p>
               <p>In the end of this Head, it will be a
curious and diverting Subject to examine
the Miracles of Jeſus, as they are litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
underſtood, by the Notions, which
our <hi>Divines</hi> have advanced about Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
and to ſhew, that even their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
compared with Chriſt's Miracles, are
deſtructive of his Authority, and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of Chriſtianity. This, I ſay, would
be a moſt diverting Undertaking, and it
will be ſtrange, if ſome <hi>Free-Thinker,</hi> that
loves Pleaſure of this kind, do's not take
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1207700100:64"/>
the hint and ſnatch the Work out of my

Eſſay on Miracles, on which the more
Remarks will be made, if it be but to pay
my Reſpects to the <hi>Arch Biſhop</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

good and right Notion of a Divine Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
and I don't doubt, but according to
it, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> think,
they can juſtifie the litteral Story of our
Saviour's Miracles, againſt the Charge of
<hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>Romance:</hi> But whether they are
able to do it or not; I ſhall go on, in
ſome Diſcourſes hereafter to be publiſh'd,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1207700100:65"/>
to prove, that our <hi>Divines,</hi> by eſpouſing

themſelves into the Belief of the moſt
arrant <hi>Quixotiſm,</hi> that can be deviſed and
palm'd upon the Underſtandings of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
I ſay they have deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
for neither the Fathers, nor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
nor even <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf meant that
his Miracles, as recorded in the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi>
ſhould be taken in a litteral Senſe,
but in <note n="76" place="bottom">Dominus noſter ea quae faciebat corporaliter, etiam ſpiritualiter volebat intelligi, <hi>&amp;c. Auguſt. Serm.</hi> xcviii. Sect. 3.</note> a myſtical, figurative and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical

them to prove, that no Ignorance and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
can be greater, than the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>Jeſus</hi> really appeal'd to his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
ſuppoſed to have been wrought by
him in the Fleſh, as to a Witneſs and
Teſtimony of his Divine Authority, and Meſſiahſhip.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time our Divines may go
on in their own Way, if they think fit,
and admire <hi>Jeſus</hi> of old, and celebrate his
Power and Praiſes for healing of bodily
Diſeaſes, and doing other notable Feats
according to the Letter of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Story; but I am for the ſpirirual <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>
who cures the worſe <note n="77" place="bottom">Quos in corporibus morbos ſanavit Chriſtus, hi in animabus exiſtunt, &amp; ſupernam ejus opem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirunt. <hi>Johan. Nepot. Hieroſ.</hi> Hom. LXI.</note> 
Diſtempers of the Soul, and do's other myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and moſt miraculous Works, of which
thoſe recorded in the Evangeliſts are but
Figure and Parable. This is the Primitive
and concurrent Opinion about the true
Meſſiah, which the Fathers univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd
to. Whether our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> at this Day,
be ſuch a ſpiritual <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to his Church,
or whether ſhe do's not ſtand in need of
ſuch a one, is the Queſtion that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
are to ſee to. But I will add here,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1207700100:67"/>
what I believe, and ſhall have another Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to prove, that God on purpoſe
ſuffer'd or empower'd <hi>falſe,</hi> as well as <hi>true</hi>
Prophets; <hi>bad</hi> as well us <hi>good</hi> Men, ſuch as
<hi>Apollonius, Veſpaſian,</hi> and many others to
cure Diſeaſes, and to do other mighty
Works, equal to what are literally report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not only to defeat us of all
Diſtinction between true and falſe Miracles,
which are the Object of our bodily Senſes,
but to raiſe and keep up our Thoughts to
the conſtant Contemplation of <hi>Jeſuſ</hi>'s ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
myſterious, and moſt miraculous
Works, which are the Object of our
Underſtandings, and loudly beſpeak the
Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, and
which are to be the abſolute Demonſtration
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Divine Authority and Meſſiahſhip
to the Converſion of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have no more to do at preſent, but,
like a <hi>Moderator,</hi> to conclude with a ſhort
Addreſs and Exhortation, to <hi>Infidels</hi> and
<hi>Apoſtates,</hi> the two contending Partys in
the preſent Controverſy. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> I mean the Writers
againſt the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Scheme.</hi> Whether
you, <hi>Grave Sirs,</hi> who account your ſelves
Orthodox <hi>Divines,</hi> tho' there is little but
Contradiction and Inconſiſtency amongſt
you, do like the Name of <hi>Apoſtates</hi> which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1207700100:68"/>
is given you, I much Queſtion: But it is
the propereſt, I could think of, for your
Deſertion of Primitive Doctrine about Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
and Miracles. I could, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
have given you a worſe <hi>Title,</hi>
but I was willing to Compliment you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Reproach you wish this.</p>
               <p>But ſetting aſide the Title of <hi>Apoſtates,</hi>
whether it be, in your Opinion, opprobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or not; you may plainly perceive,
that I am, <hi>Sirs,</hi> on your ſide, as to the
Truth of Chriſtianity, and if you'll accept
of my Aſſiſtance, for the Proof of <hi>Jesus</hi>'s
Meſſiahſhip from Prophecy, upon the Terms
of the Allegorical Scheme propoſed in my
<hi>Moderator,</hi> you ſhall find me your hearty
Abettor. Upon the Allegorical Scheme I
don't doubt, but we ſhall ſoundly drub and
maul <hi>Infidels,</hi> and beat them out of the
Field of Battle. If you, being wedded to
the litteral Scheme, will not accept of
my Aſſiſtance, you may go on in your
own Way, and ſee the Event of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
which in the End will turn to
your Diſhonour.</p>
               <p>You, <hi>Sirs,</hi> can't but be ſenſible, how
thoſe two great Generals, Mr. <hi>Grounds,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Scheme,</hi> with their potent Armies
of Reaſons, and Authorities againſt your
litteral Prophecies, have greivouſly diſtreſs'd
and gall'd you; and, if you don't make an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1207700100:69"/>
honourable Retreat in Time, and ſeek to
<hi>Allegoriſts</hi> for help, will gain a compleat
Victory, and Triumph over you.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of the help of <hi>Allegoriſts,</hi> you,
I find, under the Diſappointment of your
litteral Scheme, chuſe rather to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles: But what little
Dependance there is upon his Miracles, in
your Senſe, I have in <hi>Part</hi> proved in this
Diſcourſe; and this I have done (give me
leave repeatedly to declare it) not for the
Service of your unbelieving Adverſaries,
but to reduce you to the good old Way of
interpreting Oracles, which, upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of the Fathers, will, one Day, be
the Converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether you, <hi>Sirs,</hi> will be pleas'd with
this ſhort Diſcourſe on Chriſt's Miracles,
I much Queſtion. But before you put
your ſelves into a Rage againſt it, I beg of
you to read St. <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
St. <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and other occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ancient Pieces on one Part or other of
the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi>; and you'll find, how they
countenance ſuch a Diſcourſe as this on
Miracles, and will abundantly aſſiſt me in
the Proſecution of it.</p>
               <p>I expect, <hi>Sirs,</hi> that ſome of you will be
ready to rave againſt me for this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1207700100:70"/>
but this is my Comfort, that if
your Paſſion ſhould ariſe to another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of me, you can't poſſibly ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
any of mine from the Opinions of the
Fathers to ground a Proſecution on: And
what Diſhonor in the End will redown to
Proteſtant and pretendedly learned <hi>Divines</hi>
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to perſecute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Fathers for primitive Doctrine,
I deſire you to think on.</p>
               <p>But as I ſuppoſe you'll have more Wit,
<hi>Sirs,</hi> than to proſecute me again for this
Diſcourſe; ſo I hope you'll have more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
than odiouſly (after your wonted
manner) to repreſent me to the Populace,
for Profaneneſs, Blaſphemy and Infedelity.
If you diſlike the whole or any Part of
this Diſcourſe, appear like Men and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
from the <hi>Preſs</hi> againſt it. Uſe me as
roughly in Print as you think fit, I'll not
take it ill.</p>
               <q>Veniam petimus, dabimuſ<expan>

               <p>I deſire nothing more than to be furiouſly
attack'd from the <hi>Preſs,</hi> which, if I am not
much miſtaken, would give me a long'd for
opportunity to expoſe your Ignorance to
more Advantage.</p>
               <p>Be not longer miſtaken, <hi>Good Sirs.</hi> The
Hiſtory of <hi>Jeſus's</hi> Life, as recorded in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1207700100:71"/>
                  <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> is an emblematical Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Spiritual Life in the Soul of
Man; and his Miracles are Figures of his
myſterious Operations. The four Goſpels
are in no Part a litteral Story, but a Syſtem
of myſtical Phyloſophy or Theology.</p>
               <p>If you are reſolv'd not to come into this
Opinion, I beg of you again, before you
break forth into a Paſſion, to try to viudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the litteral Story of the three Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
ſpoken to in this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe
of Jeſus's <hi>driving the Buyers and Sellers out
of the Temple; of his exorciſing the Devil
out of the Madman; and of his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
on the Mount</hi>; which if you are able
to defend againſt the Fathers and my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
I'll give up the Cauſe to you,
and own my ſelf (what I am ſarr enough
from being) an impious Inſidel and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,
and deſerving of the worſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In the mean time I make bold
again to aſſert, that the litteral Story of
Chriſt' Life and Miracles is an abſurd and
incredible Romance, full of Contradictions
and Inconſiſtencys; and that modern Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes
are not only a conſequential Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on the Intellects of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi>
and their Divine Gifts of the Spirit, as if
they could not write an intelligible and
coherent Piece of Biography without your
Help at this Diſtance of Time; but have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1207700100:72"/>
are like an <hi>high-mettal'd blind Horſe,</hi> that,
were they not ridden by the Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with a ſtrait Rein, would be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and trampling upon all, that ſtood in
the Way of their Intereſts, to the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of <hi>Civil Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> to do's the <hi>Biſhop</hi> charge
me with. But why ſo? Becauſe I ridicule
the Nonſenſe and Abſurditys of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Miracles according to the Letter, which
he venerates. Very fine indeed! The
<hi>Biſhop</hi> would worſhip the <hi>Head</hi> of an <hi>Aſs,</hi>
and a wiſer Man than himſelf, without
the Charge of Profaneneſs, muſt not laugh
at his fooliſh Superſtition.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> laſtly does the <hi>Biſhop</hi>
accuſe me of: And this is a ſad <hi>Bugbear</hi>
Word, that has frighted Abundance of
People into dreadful Apprehenſions of my
Guilt, even to the Abhorrence of me. But
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhould firſt have defined, what
is meant by <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and have proved
one guilty of it, before he made his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations:
Or the <hi>Turks</hi> may ſay that
a Jeſt upon their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in which there
are no Contradictions, is as much a <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi>
as any Ludicrouſneſs upon the
<hi>Goſpels,</hi> which are full of Inconſiſtencies.
That there is ſuch a Sin or Error, call'd
<hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> according to the Scriptures, is
certain: But our <hi>Divines</hi> are undetermined
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1207700100:73"/>
about the Nature of it. I intend to take
my Opportunity to treat on the Sin of
Blaſphemy, and to prove, <hi>Miniſters</hi> of
the <hi>Letter</hi> are the only Perſons, that can
be guilty of it. <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi>
upon the Authority of the Fathers are
the Worſhippers of the <hi>Apocalyptical Beaſt</hi>;
and anti-allegorical Expoſitions are that
Blaſphemy, St. <hi>John</hi> writes of, which the
<hi>Beaſt</hi> and his Worſhippers, will open their
Mouths in, againſt the moſt High. This
ſhall be proved as clear as the Light.
But when I do it, I would not have any
think, it is with an Intention, to bring
the Biſhops of <hi>London, Litchfield,</hi> and St.
<hi>Davids</hi> or any other <hi>Divines,</hi> under Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
for that heinous Sin: No, my God
is omnipotent, omniſcient and omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
and knows how and when to reckon
with ſuch Blaſphemers, without calling
upon the civil Magiſtrate to do it for
him. Should I importune the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to execute Vengeance upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I ſhould make a fooliſh <hi>Calf</hi> or a Senſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Idol</hi> of my God, that was unable
or knew not how, nor when to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his own Cauſe. Surely the <hi>Biſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Work out of his Hands, and committing
it to the Care of the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Biſhop</hi> moreover ſhould conſider,
that the Words <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>blaſphemous</hi>
are of no uſe and ſignificaiton among
Philoſophers, who in Diſputation never
caſt them at each other, however they
may differ in Opinion. Philoſophers are
all ſuppoſed to be ſuch profound Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
of the Deity, as they would not
be guilty of <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>
for the whole World. If any of our
School of <hi>Free-Thinkers</hi> ſhould ſay of his
Opponent that he's <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi>
he would be reprimanded for want
of Wit, Temper and good Manners; and
be told that he's like a <hi>Billing ſgate Scold,</hi>
who had Recourſe to impertinent bad Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
when her Reaſon fails her for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Rhetorick.</p>
               <p>But it may be, for ought I know, the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> has ſome Deſign in his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt me for <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi>;
but I hope it is a better than to
prejudice the Civil Magiſtrate, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
the Populace.</p>
               <p>According to the Fathers I am ſo far
from being a Blaſphemer, that they ſay,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the litteral interpretation of his
Miracles is metamorphoſed into the falſe-Chriſt,
call'd <hi>Anti-Chriſt.</hi> Whether there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1207700100:75"/>
is any Truth in this their Opinion I can't
be poſitive, till the Experiment is fully
made. But if our <hi>Clergy</hi> will keep their
Temper, and grant me a clear Stage of
Battle, I'll try it out; and ſee whether I
I can't, by the Club of Reaſon and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Authority give their <hi>Anti-Chriſt</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Blow: Who knows but I may give
Peace to the Church, and reconcile all
Partys by it?</p>
               <p>However this may be; I am ſure, no
Man can wiſh for a greater Advantage
over his Enemy, than I have over the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> in this Controverſy: But he ſhall
find me a generous Adverſary, who will
make no worſe uſe of my Advantage
over him than now and then to put him
in Mind of his <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> and of the
Proſecution; unleſs I ſhould be tempted,
ere long, to publiſh my <hi>Moderatorial</hi>
Letter, like his <hi>Paſtoral</hi> one, to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with <hi>Ten</hi>
wholeſome Rules in it, not only to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them againſt falſe Prophets and falſe
Teachers, without forgetting the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of
the <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> but to direct them to the
Eccleſiaſtical Fountain of the growing
Sins, Errors and Infidelity of the Age,
which the <hi>Clergy</hi> know I am of Ability
to lay open.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1207700100:76"/>
When I began the Publication of theſe
<hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> I own, I laid a <hi>Trap</hi> for ſome
conſiderable <hi>Clergyman</hi>; but little ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
the great <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> would
be caught in it. But now I have taken
hold of him, I'll not releaſe him out of the
Controverſy, till he has ſorely repented of
his Ignorance or Malice in calling me a
<hi>Writer, in Favour of Infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much at preſent for the Biſhop of
<hi>London.</hi> I have been the quicker of late
in the printing of <hi>this</hi>; becauſe I am given
to underſtand, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of St. <hi>Davids</hi>
ſtays for it, intending to make but one
Work of it, and anſwer all <hi>ſix Diſcourſes</hi> together. I hope my <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s Letter here
will be thought by him, a good Payment
for his Patience, And now I ſhall be in
Expectation of his Mountainous Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and where I ſhall hide myſelf from
the terrible Strokes of his Pen, I have not
as yet conſider'd.</p>
               <p>I am not a little pleas'd to ſee a <hi>Couple</hi>
of Diſſenting Preachers, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Harris</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> liſted into the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
againſt me. If they had kept their
Necks out of the Collar, they might have
diſſembled and pretended, that, upon the
Concluſion of the Battle, when it would
have appear'd, I am a real Contender for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1207700100:77"/>
Primitive Chriſtianity, they had a better
Underſtanding of the Fathers, and a
clearer View of my Deſign, than to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
me of Blaſphemy and Infidelity:
But now they are engaged with equal
Spite, Ignorance and Defamations againſt
me, they muſt take their ſhare of the Fate
and Shame, with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> upon the
Concluſion of the Controverſy</p>
               <p>There's no Body can think it worth my
while to beſtow a Sixpenny <hi>Pamphlet</hi> upon
either of theſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> but for all that,
they ſhall not be altogether ſlighted and
neglected by me. I have made a Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Rhetorical Flowers, which
occaſionally ſhall be preſented to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
to the Admiration of their Wit,
Reaſon, Learning and Eloquence. And
at preſent only take Notice, that they
are <hi>both</hi> for the Perſecution of me; but
not ſo much for my Opinions, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency,
Irreverence, and Immorality of
my Stile; forfooth ! which is ſuch a
Diſtinction, as may be eaſily Stretch'd to
the Juſtification of the Perſecution of all
Authors, whom the Prieſthood in Power
ſhall not like. Mr. <hi>Atkinſon's</hi> Argument
for the Preſecution of me, is much the
ſame with that, which <hi>John Calvin</hi> uſed
for the Perſecution of that great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Servetus</hi>; the Injuſtice and Cruelty of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1207700100:78"/>
whoſe death and ſufferings is a greater
Reproach to the Name of <hi>Calvin,</hi> than the
Martyrdom of any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can be to
the Memory of any Popiſh Prelate.</p>
               <p>To conclude, what I have written, in
theſe <hi>Six Diſcourſes,</hi> is with a View to
the Glory of God, the Advancement of
Truth, the Happineſs of Mankind, the
Demolition of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Edification
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Demonſtration of the
Meſſiahſhip of our Spiritual <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to
