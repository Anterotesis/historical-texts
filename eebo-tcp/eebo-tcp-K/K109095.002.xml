            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE Chriſtianity appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World, there reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Bohemia</hi> a King, named <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> who was married to a Princeſs of exquiſite Beauty and conſummate Virtue, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bellaria.</hi> The Harmony that ſubſiſted between this royal Couple gave the greateſt Satisfaction to all their Subjects, whoſe Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was greatly increaſed by the Felicity of their Sovereigns.</p>
               <p>At the End of the firſt Year of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage <hi>Bellaria</hi> was delivered of a Son, who was named <hi>Garrinter.</hi> The <hi>Bohemians</hi> upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0451201402:4"/>
this Occaſion made great Rejoicings over all the Kingdom. And the King, as well to expreſs his own Satisfaction at this happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, as to comply with the Deſires of the People, appointed Juſts and Tournaments in Honour of the young Prince; to which not only many foreign Noblemen reſorted, but alſo ſeveral neighbouring Kings and Princes came to exerciſe their Valour and Judgment at theſe martial Entertainments.</p>
               <p>The Sports laſted twenty Days, during which Time the King made a general Feaſt for all his Subjects; and the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who had been royally entertained, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to their reſpective Countries, full of Admiration of the great Magnificence of <hi>Pandoſto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Smiles of Fortune are ſeldom ſincere or laſting; the fickle Goddeſs, weary of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing Favours upon <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> while he was wholly taken up in the Enjoyment of them, prepared a ſad reverſe of Fate for him and the lovely <hi>Bellaria. Pandoſto,</hi> from his earlieſt Youth, had contracted and maintained a ſtrict Friendſhip and Correſpondence with <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> the young King of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Prince being deſirous of ſhewing that neither Time nor Diſtance of Place could weaken the Force of his Affection for <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſto,</hi> reſolved to viſit him in his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to congratulate him upon his Marriage and the Birth of a Son. For this Purpoſe he ordered a ſmall Fleet to be prepared, and with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0451201402:5"/>
a ſmall but ſelect Number of Attendants ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto</hi> and his Queen, with a numerous Retinue, went to meet <hi>Egiſtus</hi> at his landing, and carried him to the Palace in the midſt of moſt expenſive Shows and magnificent Arches, which had been prepared and erected for his Reception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> whoſe Heart overflowed with grateful Tranſport for this Demonſtration of Friendſhip in <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> intreated his Queen to ſhew all imaginable Reſpect and Eſteem to a Prince whom he loved ſo much, and to whom he was ſo highly obliged.</p>
               <p>The ſweet <hi>Bellaria,</hi> who had no other Will but that of her Huſband, was eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to comply with a Requeſt to which her own Inclinations naturally incited her, for the noble Qualities ſhe obſerved in <hi>Egiſtus</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced ſuitable Effects in a Mind, that being virtuous and ſenſible to the higheſt Degree itſelf, could not chuſe but love thoſe Perfections in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellaria</hi> therefore, as well in Obedience to her Huſband's Commands, as in Conſequence of the Friendſhip ſhe had conceived for <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> gave him every Day a thouſand innocent Marks of her Eſteem, which that Prince, who admired and loved her Perfections with all the Warmth of a diſintereſted Friend, did not fail to return with every Inſtance of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0451201402:6"/>This mutual Eſteem gave riſe to an eaſy Confidence and familiar Intercourſe between them; ſo that <hi>Pandoſto</hi> being often engaged with his Miniſters in Affairs of State, <hi>Bellaria</hi> and <hi>Egiſtus</hi> paſſed away the Time in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in various Diſcourſes and innocent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, all which at firſt was very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pandoſto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that unhappy Prince, either becauſe he was conſcious of the ſuperior Merit of <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> or through the natural Bent of his Diſpoſition, began to look with ſuſpicious Eyes on a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Familiarity which he had been ſo ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to form: Doubtful and uneaſy Thoughts aroſe in his Mind, he reflected on the irreſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Charms of <hi>Bellaria,</hi> and the manly Beauty and noble Qualities of <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> and thought it impoſſible that two Perſons ſo formed to pleaſe ſhould be inſenſible to each others Merit.</p>
               <p>Theſe Doubts having entered his Mind, he fed his growing Jealouſy with continual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the Looks and Words of his Friend and Wife; and prejudiced as he now was, their innocent Familiarity appeared to him to be a convincing Proof of their guilty Paſſion; Suſpicion was now changed to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Certainty; he no longer looked upon <hi>Egiſtus</hi> as his Friend and Gueſt, but as the Deſtroyer of his Honour, and the Violater of his Queen.</p>
               <p>A violent Hatred ſucceeded the tender Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he once bore to <hi>Egiſtus;</hi> and thoſe Smiles of Love with which he had always
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0451201402:7"/>
been accuſtomed to behold the charming <hi>Bellaria,</hi> gave Place to ſullen Reſerve and gloomy Frowns: Racked with the torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remembrance of his fancied Wrongs, the Deſire and Hope of Revenge afforded him ſome Intervals of Eaſe.</p>
               <p>He reſolved therefore to poiſon <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> and while his Mind was labouring how to execute his cruel Purpoſe with Security, his Words and Behaviour ſtill wore an Appearance of Friendſhip and Reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto</hi> had a Cup-bearer, named <hi>Franion,</hi> whom, becauſe he had always ſhewn an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attachment to his Perſon, he believed it would be eaſy to perſuade to execute his purpoſed Vengeance on the King of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Man therefore the jealous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch communicated his ungenerous Deſign, and promiſed him a large Reward, if when the next Time that <hi>Egiſtus</hi> called for Drink at his Table, he would put Poiſon in his Cup.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franion</hi> ſhuddered with Horror at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Propoſition; and with all the Freedom of a good Man and a faithful Subject he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſſuade his King from his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Purpoſe. He repreſented to him that Murder was an unpardonable Offence to the Gods, and abhorred by all Mankind, that ſuch unnatural Crimes not only drew down the Wrath of Heaven upon the Perpetrators of them, but the Revenge of Men. He urged to him the ſacred Laws of Hoſpitality,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0451201402:8"/>
that <hi>Egiſtus</hi> was his Gueſt, his Friend and Ally; that any Cruelty committed upon his Perſon would brand his Name with perpetual Infamy, and ſow the laſting Seeds of Diſcord and Hatred between the <hi>Sicilians</hi> and <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and that even his own Subjects would murmur at ſuch an unexampled Piece of Cruelty and Treachery.</p>
               <p>Theſe Arguments had no Force with the determined <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> who, perſiſting ſtill in his cruel Reſolution, gave <hi>Franion</hi> his Choice either to poiſon <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> and be rewarded with Riches and Honours, or to ſuffer Death for his Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franion,</hi> ſtaggered by theſe dreadful Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings on one Hand, and allured by thoſe great Promiſes on the other, told <hi>Pandoſto</hi> that he would obey him, and as ſoon as a fair Opportunity offered he would poiſon <hi>Egiſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King was very well pleaſed with this Promiſe, and reſolved as ſoon as his deſigned Vengeance on <hi>Egiſtus</hi> was executed, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>Bellaria</hi> in the ſame Manner, to his abuſed Love and injured Honour.</p>
               <p>When the King was departed, <hi>Franion</hi> having no longer that dreadful Object before his Eyes, threatening Death and Torments if he did not murder the innocent Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reflect ſeriouſly upon the horrid Deed he had engaged to perform: Murder he thought, however ſecretly and ſecurely committed, might for a Time avoid Danger, but never wholly eſcape Puniſhment; that no Balm, no Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0451201402:9"/>
could heal the Stings of a wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the Guilt of innocent Blood would always be accompanied with Remorſe and Horror.</p>
               <p>He reflected that, though he was a Subject, his King had no Right to his Obedience when his Commands were contrary to the expreſs Will and Pleaſure of the Gods, to whom he owed a higher Duty.</p>
               <p>He conſidered, that the peaceful Calm of a contented Mind in an humble Condition was preferable to the reſtleſs Turbulence of Dignity and Riches, when purchaſed with Crimes and ſtained with Blood, and that honeſt Poverty was infinitely better than ſhameful Grandeur.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that he muſt either die with a clear Mind, or live with a foul and ſpotted Conſcience; his Soul was ſo perplexed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Extremes that he could take no Reſt; at laſt he determined to diſcover the Affair to <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> and for that Purpoſe he went to his Apartments, and deſiring a private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> he was admitted to his Preſence, and in a few Words laid open the whole Conſpiracy againſt him.</p>
               <p>The Brave and Generous are not eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe thoſe they love are capable of Baſeneſs and Ingratitude. <hi>Egiſtus</hi> judging of <hi>Pandoſto</hi>'s Heart by the Rectitude of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s own, told <hi>Franion</hi> with a ſevere Countenance, that he would not entertain a Thought to the Prejudice of the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>'s Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Pandoſto,</hi> continued he, is my Friend and Ally, no Suſpicion has ever yet interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0451201402:10"/>
our mutual Affection, I did not come here to invade his Territories, to ſeduce his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Allegiance, or to conſpire with his Enemies. Since therefore I have given him no Cauſe to ſeek my Death, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe him guilty of ſo unjuſt and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous a Deſign; but rather ſuſpect the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation you have given me to be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a Combination among the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> to create a Variance between me and their King."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franion</hi> replied, "that it was dangerous to dally with the Rage of an incenſed and ſecret Enemy; that if the <hi>Bohemians</hi> had intended any Harm to him they might eaſily accompliſh it without revealing their Conſpiracy; that it was unkind therefore in his Majeſty to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue his Zeal for his Preſervation into a treacherous Deſign, for that his Intention was to prevent Treaſon, not to become a Traitor."</p>

                  <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> weighing the Matter thoroughly in his Mind, gave many Thanks to <hi>Franion,</hi> and promiſing if he arrived ſafe in <hi>Sicily</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him royally; he deſired him to contrive the Method of their Eſcape.</p>

                  <hi>Franion</hi> went immediately to conſult with the Admiral of <hi>Egiſtus</hi>'s Fleet, and it was agreed between them, that it ſhould be put in Readineſs to ſail as ſoon as a fair Wind and Opportunity offered.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time <hi>Franion</hi> amuſed <hi>Pandoſto</hi> with Hopes of ſoon having his ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Revenge accompliſhed, telling him that he was employed in preparing and compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſubtle a Poiſon, that the Moment it was ſwallowed would procure immediate Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto</hi> received this News with a malignant Joy, every Hour ſeeming an Age to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Fury till His Revenge was ſatiated with the Death of thoſe who had offended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egiſtus</hi> being informed that a favourable Gale had ſprung up, conveyed himſelf and his <hi>Sicilians,</hi> by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Franion,</hi> out of a Poſtern Gate of the City, with ſuch Secreſy and Expedition, that they got on board their Ships without the leaſt Suſpicion, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Sails to the Wind ſoon loſt Sight of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Pandoſto</hi> was informed that <hi>Egiſtus</hi> had fled away in the Night, and that <hi>Franion</hi> was gone with him, he let looſe all his Rage upon his Queen, whom he accuſed of conſpiring with <hi>Egiſtus</hi> and the Traitor <hi>Franion,</hi> and commanded ſhe ſhould be led to Priſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> were all alarmed, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſome Treaſon; and the furious <hi>Pandoſto</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0451201402:12"/>
believing the Queen not only guilty of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring his Bed, but of projecting the Flight of <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> ſent his Guards with Orders to ſeize her.</p>
               <p>The innocent <hi>Bellaria</hi> not expecting the impending Storm, was playing with her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Son <hi>Garrinter,</hi> when the Guards, with much Reluctance, came to execute the King's Demands.</p>
               <p>The Queen was at firſt aſtoniſhed and turned pale, but recollecting herſelf, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming all the noble Pride of conſcious Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and affronted Virtue, ſhe gave her Hand to the Captain of the Guard, and without murmuring, ſuffered him to lead her to her Priſon, where ſhe ſpent the Time in patient Sorrow and abſolute Reſignation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> mad with the Diſappointment of his Revenge upon <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> reſolved it ſhould fall doubly heavy on the Head of the injured <hi>Bellaria,</hi> he therefore cauſed it to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout all his Dominions, that the Queen had committed Adultery with <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> and with his Cup-bearer, <hi>Franion,</hi> had conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Death.</p>
               <p>Though the Queen's Life had hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared blameleſs, yet this confident Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Flight of the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Franion,</hi> raiſed many Suſpicions againſt her in the Minds of the People, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily offered up Prayers for her Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
               <p>Her Youth, her Beauty, the Sweetneſs of her Manners, but above all her Misfortunes, excited every one's Compaſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0451201402:13"/>But the cruel <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> in whoſe rocky Boſom Pity could find no Acceſs, reſolved to load the unfortunate <hi>Bellaria</hi> with every Kind of Infamy and Hardſhip; he would not allow her to be treated in the Priſon with the Reſpect due to the Rank ſhe once held, but cauſed her to be ſerved and attended with the moſt cruel Neglect.</p>
               <p>The Cruelties he exerciſed on the Queen did but in Part ſatisfy his Revenge, he longed to make <hi>Egiſtus</hi> feel the Weight of his Fury: But this Monarch was ſo powerful by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, having married the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia</hi>'s Daughter, that he deſpaired of ever being able by open Force to accompliſh his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
               <p>The unhappy Queen being informed of the vile Accuſation againſt her ſo openly proclaimed, conſcious of her own ſpotleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and the Integrity of <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated that ſhe might be brought to a public Trial, confronted with her Accuſer, and allowed to anſwer for herſelf.</p>
               <p>But the King was ſo inflamed with Rage and Jealouſy that he would not receive her Petition; and while the poor Queen was thus languiſhing under the Weight of her Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and hopeleſs of Redreſs, ſhe perceived herſelf to be quick with Child.</p>
               <p>So affecting an Incident in her melancholy Condition drew Complaints from her, which ſoftening the rugged Temper of her Keeper;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0451201402:14"/>
he cauſed the King to be immediately inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, not doubting but the News would induce him to ſet her at Liberty.</p>
               <p>The Queen's Pregnancy however produced quite a contrary Effect; for the King no ſooner heard of it than ſtarting up in a violent Fury, he ſwore <hi>Bellaria</hi> and her Baſtard ſhould die, even though the Gods themſelves ſhould ſay no.</p>
               <p>The Queen, notwithſtanding ſo many cruel Afflictions, was happily delivered of a Daughter; and <hi>Pandoſto</hi> immediately declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Reſolution to have both the Mother and Child burnt.</p>
               <p>The Noblemen of his Court uſed all the Arguments their Reaſon and Humanity could furniſh them with, to prevail upon him to change his barbarous Purpoſe, but all they could do was to prevent the Murder of the Child.</p>
               <p>The Queen's Doom he told them was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably fixed, but though at the earneſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of his Nobles, he promiſed the Child ſhould not be put to Death, yet the Reſolution he took concerning it was little leſs cruel, ſince by it he only meant to protract its Faté.</p>
               <p>He ſent a Perſon to the Priſon with Orders to take the Infant from its wretched Mother, and putting it into a Boat and launching it into the Sea, leave it to the Mercy of the Wind and Waves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0451201402:15"/>The Guards who aſſiſted at this barbarous Deed, moved by the ſweet Countenance of the innocent Babe, could not help accuſing the King of great Cruelty; nevertheleſs Fear of his Reſentment obliged them to execute his Commands.</p>
               <p>They put the Child into a Boat, covering it with Boughs to preſerve it from the Incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Weather, and ſet it into the Ocean, when immediately ſo great a Storm aroſe, that it was with much Difficulty they got to ſhore again.</p>
               <p>This horrid Deed accompliſhed, the King aſſembled his Nobles and Counſellors, and <hi>Bellaria</hi> was brought into Court, where ſhe heard the Charge againſt her read.</p>
               <p>The Queen, who ſaw nothing but her Death would ſatisfy the incenſed King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in her own Innocence, aſſumed all the Courage her unhappy Condition required, and with a noble Haughtineſs demanded to have Law and Juſtice; "for Mercy, ſaid ſhe, I do not expect; let my Accuſers therefore appear in Court, and give their Evidences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Face."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto</hi> replied, "that the Witneſſes were of ſuch Credit that their Words alone were ſufficient; that for her, indeed it was her Part to deny ſuch a monſtrous Crime, and forſwear herſelf, ſeeing that ſhe had overcome all Senſe of Shame and Remorſe in committing it; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0451201402:16"/>
added he, you ſhall die, and die a moſt cruel and ignominious Death."</p>
               <p>The Queen, not terrified by theſe Threats, replied without any Emotion, "that to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Puniſhment without Proof, was Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, not Law."</p>
               <p>The Nobles approved of what ſhe ſaid, and required that her Accuſers ſhould be ſworn and openly examined; and if the Queen's Guilt was fully proved, his Majeſty might condemn her to ſuffer the Puniſhment ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law for ſuch Offences.</p>
               <p>The King anſwered, "that in this Caſe he could and would diſpenſe with the Law, and that the Nobles ſhould take his Word for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence, otherwiſe he would make the proudeſt of them repent it.</p>
               <p>This Threat ſtruck them all dumb, but <hi>Bellaria,</hi> who deſpaired of Life, and dreaded Infamy more than Death, ſaid, "if his Will muſt be the Law, the Jury's Verdict will be uſeleſs: Then falling on her Knees, ſhe conjured the King by the Love he bore to the young Prince <hi>Garrinter</hi> his Son, that he would grant her one Requeſt, which was to ſend ſix of his Nobles, in whom he placed the greateſt Confidence, to the Iſland of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and there conſult the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Crimes ſhe was accuſed of."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto</hi> could not refuſe ſo reaſonable a Requeſt, and having named ſix Embaſſadors to be diſpatched with all Speed to <hi>Delphos,</hi> he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0451201402:17"/>
committed the Queen to cloſe Impriſonment till their Return.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors performed their Voyage in three Weeks, and as ſoon as they landed at <hi>Delphos,</hi> they went to the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and with great Devotion offered Sacrifices to the God, and Gifts to his Prieſts, according to Cuſtom, and then humbly beſought an Anſwer to their Demands.</p>
               <p>They had not kneeled long at the Altar, when <hi>Apollo</hi> with a loud Vice ſaid, <hi>"Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> what you find behind the Altar take and depart;" they obeyed the Oracle, and found a Scroll of Parchment, which the Prieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to open but in the Preſence of the King.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors aſſured him of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Obedience to his Injunctions, and their Devotions being finiſhed they left the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſailed with a fair Wind for <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where they ſoon arrived, and haſtened to Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandoſto</hi> received them very graciouſly, and they after giving him an Account of their Voyage, preſented the divine Scroll to him, intreating him at the ſame Time, ſince the Queen's Life or Death, her Innocence or Guilt, was contained in that ſacred Writing, that he would ſummon the Nobility to meet in the Judgment Hall, and before them and the accuſed Queen cauſe the Oracle to be read.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0451201402:18"/>The King approved of their Advice, and on the Day appointed the King and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles being all aſſembled in the Court, the Queen was brought to the Bar, and thus ſpoke.</p>
               <p>"How I have led my Life before <hi>Egiſtus</hi> came into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> I appeal, <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> to thy Conſcience, and to the immortal Gods; they only know whether I am guilty of the Crimes whereof I am accuſed; for me, I here proteſt my Innocence, and for the Truth of what I ſay, I refer myſelf to the divine Oracle.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Bellaria</hi> being ſilent, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one of his Nobles to open the Scroll, which he did, and read aloud the following Words, which were written in Letters of Gold.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The ORACLE.</head>
                  <p>"Suſpicion is no Proof; Jealouſy is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judge; <hi>Bellaria</hi> is chaſte, <hi>Egiſtus</hi> blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <hi>Franion</hi> a true Subject; <hi>Pandoſto</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous; his Babe innocent, and the King ſhall die without an Heir, if that which is loſt be not found."</p>
                  <p>After the Oracle was read the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded with joyful Acclamations; the Queen's Innocence thus manifeſted, filled every Heart with Tranſport.</p>
                  <p>The King beginning now to be aſhamed of his raſh Jealouſy and unjuſt Suſpicions, not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0451201402:19"/>
daring to approach the wronged <hi>Bellaria,</hi> deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Nobles to implore her to forgive the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries he had offered her; and ſtung with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and Horror at his paſt Actions, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly confeſſed his Deſign againſt the Life of <hi>Egiſtus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While he was thus laying open his own Treachery, a Meſſenger came haſtily into the Court, and informed the King that the Prince <hi>Garrinter</hi> was dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellaria,</hi> whoſe Soul had been overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Joy by the divine Oracle, which had declared her Innocence, was ſeized with ſuch an Exceſs of Sorrow at theſe dreadful Tidings, that her tender Heart, not able to ſupport the Force of theſe contrary Extreams, burſt with the mighty Weight, and ſinking down ſhe expired in a Moment.</p>
                  <p>The King became ſenſeleſs at this dreadful Sight, and being carried to the Palace, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Endeavours of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans he lay ſpeechleſs three Days.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> were in the utmoſt Deſpair, nothing but Mourning and Complaints were to be ſeen and heard; the Death of the Queen and Prince, and the extream Danger the King was in, filled the whole City with Grief and Conſternation; at length he recovered his Senſes and his Speech, and this News in ſome Meaſure revived the drooping <hi>Bohemians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the King's Deſpair was ſo violent that he attempted to murder himſelf, and was with

Difficulty prevented by his Nobles, who uſed all the Arguments they could think of to calm his Mind and perſwade him to bear his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes patiently.</p>
                  <p>Their dutiful Cares at laſt ſucceeded, the King grew more patient and reſigned, and gave Orders for the Interment of his Queen and Son, which was performed in the moſt ſolemn and ſplendid Manner.</p>
                  <p>Once in every Day he went to <hi>Bellaria</hi>'s Tomb, and with Tears of Penitence and Sorrow lamented her unhappy Fate, and his own Misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>Here we muſt leave this diſtreſſed Prince for a while, to relate what befell the Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant whom we left floating on the Ocean.</p>
                  <p>The Boat in which it was laid being toſt for two Days with the Wind and Sea, and every Moment ready to periſh in the Waves; it pleaſed the Gods to direct it at laſt to the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where it was drove on Shore.</p>
                  <p>It fortunately happened that a Shepherd who had miſſed one of his Sheep, not finding it in any of the Covers hard by, came to the Sea-ſide in Hopes it was there browſing on the Sea-Ivy, and hearing the Voice of a Child, which he at firſt miſtook for the Bleating of a Sheep, went to the Sands and ſaw a Boat driven on Ground; he immediately waded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and diſcovered a moſt beautiful Babe lying at the Bottom, wrapt in a Scarlet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0451201402:21"/>
Mantle embroidered with Gold, and a Chain of rich Jewels about its Neck.</p>
                  <p>The Shepherd, aſtoniſhed at this Adventure, beholding the Beauty of the Infant, and the Riches that were about it, began to think it was ſome little Divinity, and was going to adore it; when the weak Cries of the Child, who ſeemed to be juſt periſhing with Cold and Hunger, perſuaded him it was a meer Mortal.</p>
                  <p>Compaſſion took the Place of Reverence; he approached the Child, took it into his Arms, and ſuppoſing by the extraordinary Magnificence of its Dreſs that it was of noble Birth, he reſolved to carry it to the King.</p>
                  <p>As he was wrapping the Mantle cloſe about it to preſerve it better from the Cold, a Bag of Money fell from it at his Feet; which he take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, was ſo captivated with the Sight, that changing his Deſign he determined to breed up the Infant himſelf, and apply the Money to his own Uſe; then returned a bye Way to his Cottage leſt any one ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what he carried in his Arms.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he entered the Door the Child began to cry; which alarming his Wife, who ſuppoſed he was bringing home a Baſtard to nurſe, ſhe rated him very ſeverely for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
                  <p>The Shepherd begged her to be pacified, and told her if ſhe would be ſecret and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous their Fortunes were made for ever; then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0451201402:22"/>
putting the Child in her Arms he produced the Gold and Jewels he found with it, which ſo pleaſed the poor Woman that ſhe reſolved to nurſe the Child carefully, and make their Neighbours believe it was their own.</p>
                  <p>The Gold and Jewels they concealed, and the Shepherd returned to the Care of his Flocks, while his Wife employed herſelf in nurſing the Foundling, to whom they gave the Name of <hi>Fawnia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a few Years after the Shepherd purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good Farm, and from tending the Flocks of other People became Maſter of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable one himſelf.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Fawnia</hi> arrived at the Age of ten Years, <hi>Porrus</hi> and <hi>Mopſa,</hi> for ſo her ſuppoſed Father and Mother were called, committed the Care of their Flocks; to her, and the young Shepherdeſs, whoſe Beauty at thoſe early Years was the Aſtoniſhment and Admiration of all that beheld her, applied herſelf with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Diligence to her paſtoral Employment, ſo that every Thing proſpered under her Hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Porrus</hi> now purchaſed Land, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to leave <hi>Fawnia</hi> at his Death; and ſhe growing to fifteen Years old, many of the rich Farmer's Sons made their Addreſſes to her.</p>
                  <p>The fair Shepherdeſs was not the only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Wonder of the Country, her Wit and Judgment was equal to her Beauty, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0451201402:23"/>
thoſe uncommon Charms of Mind and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon made her even be talked of at Court.</p>
                  <p>She who believed herſelf to be the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Porrus,</hi> was not elated with the Praiſes that were beſtowed on her, but with a ſweet Humility conformed to the Lowlineſs of her Condition, and tended her Flocks with the utmoſt Diligence and Care.</p>
                  <p>Though ſhe was not vain of the Graces of her Perſon, yet her rural Habit was always exactly neat, her lovely Hair was bound up with a graceful Negligence, and ſhe took Care to chooſe the freſheſt and moſt becoming Flowers to compoſe the Garland which ſhaded her charming Face from the Sun.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Sicily</hi> had only one Son, named <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> a beautiful and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Youth, of whom the <hi>Sicilians</hi> had great Hopes.</p>
                  <p>The King, deſirous of ſeeing him married before he died, ſent an Ambaſſador to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to demand the Princeſs <hi>Euphania</hi> his Daughter, and the Heir to his Dominions, in Marriage for the Prince of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> agreeing to the Propoſal, <hi>Egiſtus</hi> acquainted his Son with the Treaty he had entered into; he enlarged on the Beauty and Virtues of the Princeſs <hi>Euphania,</hi> on the Advantages of an Alliance with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and concluded with praiſing the Gods for the happy Succeſs of his Negociation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0451201402:24"/>
                     <hi>Doraſtus</hi> heard all this with ſuch apparent Indifference that the King was amazed, and aſked him if he had any Objection to the Match?</p>
                  <p>The Prince anſwered coldly, "That his Heart was yet a Stranger to Love, that all Women were indifferent to him, and that Marriage was an Engagement he had no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to enter into."</p>
                  <p>The King, extremely offended with this Reply, threatened him with the ſevereſt Effects of his Diſpleaſure if he did not endeavour to conform to his Will; and finding the Prince continued in a ſullen Silence, and would give him no Satisfaction, he quitted him in great Diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doraſtus</hi> was ſenſibly afflicted at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Anger, and ardently wiſhed he could conquer that Repugnance he felt in his Soul to Marriage, that he might not offend him by an abſolute Refuſal; but the more he ſtruggled to overcome that Diſlike which forced him to ſeem diſobedient to his Father, the deeper he found it rooted in his Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort Time after this Diſcourſe had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the King and the Prince, there happened to be a Meeting of all the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Daughters in <hi>Sicily.</hi>

Evening approached they ſeparated, and <hi>Fawnia</hi> deſiring a neighbouring Sheperdeſs to go with her to ſee if her Flock was folded, <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> who was returning from Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, met the two Virgins as they were going home, and ſtruck with Admiration at the Beauty of <hi>Fawnia,</hi> he ſtopt and aſked her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral trifling Queſtions, in order to have an Opportunity of gazing on her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fawnia</hi> aſwered him with ſo much ſprightly Wit and ſo graceful an Air, that the Prince already half vanquiſhed by the Charms of her Perſon, was wholly ſubdued by thoſe of her Mind. Love, offended at the former Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of this young Rebel, reſolved now to make him feel the utmoſt Effects of his Power, and with the keeneſt Arrow in his Quiver, pierced that once inſenſible Heart.</p>
                  <p>The Prince ſighed with Pain and Pleaſure; he could not remove his Eyes from the lovely Face of <hi>Fawnia,</hi> which was all overſpread with a roſy Bluſh; he ſaw her Confuſion, and aſhamed of his own Weakneſs he reſolved to force himſelf away, and clapping Spurs to his Horſe he haſtily bid the Shepherdeſſes farewel, and rode home to the Palace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fawnia,</hi> who had ſurveyed the Prince with a curious Eye, began as ſoon as he was gone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0451201402:26"/>
full of the Prince's Perfections, ſhe could not find Words ſufficient to expreſs her Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe perceived at length, and bluſhed at, her Indiſcretion, and remained ſilent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed during the reſt of their Walk.</p>
                  <p>She took Leave of her Companion at the Door of her Cottage, and retired to Bed full of a pleaſing Anxiety for which her inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Innocence could not yet find a Name.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, whoſe Mind was ſtill more reſtleſs and uneaſy than <hi>Fawnia</hi>'s, becauſe he better underſtood the nature of his Diſtemper, paſſed the Night in various and tormenting Thoughts: Fain would he have baniſhed the ſweet Image of <hi>Fawnia</hi> from his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but Love had engraved it too deeply in his Heart, and finding his Endeavours to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her fruitleſs, he ſought to excuſe and juſtify his Paſſion, by reflecting on the inevitable Charms of her that cauſed it.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, cruel! oh, injurious Fortune! cried he, tranſported with the bright Idea, to hide ſuch Perfection in a Cottage, and laviſh Crowns and Scepters often on Deformity."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! <hi>Fawnia,</hi> was that inchanting Form made only to grace the Fields? were theſe bright Eyes ordained to ſhine in humble Vales, and only bleſs rude Swains with their Love darting Beams? was that ſprightly Wit and thoſe native Graces of thy Mind given thee to be for ever clouded in a Cottage?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! no, it cannot be, the Gods are juſt and equal in their Diſpenſations, and though they did not make you born a Princeſs, they did more, and made you deſerving to be one;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0451201402:27"/>
I am their Inſtrument to raiſe you to the Rank for which Nature deſigned you, and which no other can ſo worthily fill.</p>
                  <p>The amorous Prince pauſed at theſe Words, then ſuddenly giving Way to new Reflexions, "How would it pleaſe my Father, cried he, to know that my Heart is capable of Love? oh! divine Law, feared by all Men, becauſe honoured by the Gods themſelves."</p>
                  <p>"But alas! <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> added he, breathing a deep and dreadful Sigh, who is it that is the Object of thy Paſſion? a rural Maid, the Daughter of a ſimple Shepherd. Does this Match ſuit with the Dignity of thy Birth? thou who art the Son of a King, and Heir to a powerful Kingdom. Ah! let me rather die than poorly ſubmit to ſuch a ſhameful Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for 'tis better to periſh nobly than to live with Contempt."</p>
                  <p>The wavering Prince, reſting a while upon this thought, endeavoured to collect his whole Force of Reaſon to ſupport a Reſolution which ſeemed worthy of himſelf; but Love, who laughed at all his vain Attempts to elude his Power, again impreſt the lovely Image of <hi>Fawnia</hi> upon his Fancy.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Beauty, ſaid the ſighing Prince, how abſolute is thy Empire over the Heart! ſweet and imperious Tyrant thou ſhalt be obeyed, I yield to thy irreſiſtable Force; yes <hi>Fawnia,</hi> lovely and adorable <hi>Fawnia,</hi> thou ſhalt be mine, thy humble Birth ſhall be no Obſtacle to my Deſires."</p>

                  <p>The Prince having thus taken his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Mind grew eaſy and compoſed, but it was far otherwiſe with the charming Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs, ſtrange and unuſual Dreams perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her roving Fancy the whole Night.</p>

                  <p>She awaked, but not as uſual refreſhed with her Repoſe; her renewed Spirits ſparkling in her chearful Eyes, and eager to begin the rural Labours of the Day, but heavy, languiſhing, and full of uneaſy Perturbations, ſhe roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her wonted Hour, and thinking to baniſh the various Thoughts which tormented her by induſtrious Toils; ſhe drove her Flocks to the Field, ſhifted the Folds, and doubled her Morning's Work; at laſt fatigued and breathleſs ſhe ſat down at the Foot of a Tree, and thus began to accuſe the Folly and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of her new Paſſion.</p>

                  <p>Weary at length of the intolerable Reſtraint his Pride had forced him to lay upon his Wiſhes, he reſolved to ſatisfy his longing Eyes with another Sight of the ſweet, but dangerous <hi>Fawnia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this Purpoſe he ſtole ſecretly out of the Palace, and without any Attendants took his Way to the Fields where he had firſt ſeen the beauteous Shepherdeſs <hi>Fawnia.</hi>

                  <p>The paſſionate Prince ſtood at a little Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſome Moments, contemplating her with an Exceſs of Wonder and Delight, when <hi>Fawnia</hi> happening to look up, ſhe met

his ardent Gaze, and this ſudden and unexpected Sight gave her ſo much Emotion, that her fair Face was in an Inſtant dyed with a roſy Bluſh.</p>

                     <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> who thought this Converſation the moſt pleaſing of any he ever had, would have perhaps drawn it out to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Length, but perceiving ſome of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants approaching, he was willing to know a little more of her Heart before he parted from her.</p>

                  <p>The Prince, after a little Pauſe, replied, "It ſeems then, <hi>Fawnia,</hi> that you cannot love <hi>Doraſtus."</hi>

                  <p>She ſeated herſelf again at the Foot of the Hill, revolving in her Mind all the Prince had ſaid to her, and this ſecond View of him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Affability of his Behaviour, and ſome flattering Hopes ſhe began to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, entirely compleated the Conqueſt of her Heart.</p>
                  <p>For ſome Moments ſhe reſigned herſelf up to the moſt ſoothing Reflexions, but when the Lowneſs of her Condition ruſhed upon her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0451201402:35"/>
Thoughts, and broke the ſweet Deluſion ſhe was ſo fond of, then ſhe began to blame the Extravagance of her Wiſhes, and tried to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect her ſcattered Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! <hi>Fawnia,</hi> whiſpered ſhe, why doſt thou gaze at the Sun and graſp at Wind?

But what then? added ſhe after a little Pauſe, muſt all fall who endeavour to riſe becauſe ſome do? no, Happineſs comes by Chance, and Fortune winds thoſe Threads which the Deſtinies ſpin. Alas! what ſtrange Perplexity am I in, favoured by a Prince, yet obliged through Prudence to reject that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Denial in my Words, and Deſire at the bottom of my Heart; I love <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> yet I ſeem diſpleaſed with his Courtſhip.

                  <p>While Love made this Havock in the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Breaſt of <hi>Fawnia,</hi> he raged with ſuch Violence in the Heart of the paſſionate Prince, in which the Pride of royal Birth maintained an unequal Conflict, that ſinking under the Force of thoſe contrary Paſſions, he became a Prey to Melancholy and Deſpair; he loathed his Food, Sleep fled from his Eyes, he grew pale and wan, and fell into a languiſhing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                  <p>The King, amazed at the Alteration in his Son, and trembling for his Life, ordered the Attendance of the ableſt Phyſicians in his Kingdom; but their Art was all in vain.</p>
                  <p>The Prince himſelf grew apprehenſive of the Danger he was in, he found he could not live without <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and thought it great Folly to die for what it was in his Power to obtain; Honour long oppoſed the Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Deſires, but Love, reſiſtleſs Love, at Length prevailed.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, wholly abandoning himſelf to the Power of this ſweet Tyrant, procured a Shepherd's Habit and a Crook, and making them to be conveyed to a ſecret Place, he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0451201402:37"/>
went privately out of the Palace, and attiring himſelf in thoſe rural Weeds, took his Way to the Place where his charming Shepherdeſs fed her Flocks.</p>
                  <p>As he went along ſome uneaſy Reflexions aroſe in his Mind when he ſurveyed his homely Dreſs.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> ſaid he to himſelf, what a ſtrange Alteration is here, a Prince transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Peaſant! does this wild Folly ſuit with the Dignity of thy Birth? but indeed thy Habit ſuits well with thy groveling Thoughts; this is thy proper Dreſs, thou wert always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed before. Oh! Gods, for what Crime am I aſſigned this Penance? Oh! Love, what a fond Ideot haſt thou made of me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yet why ſhould I bluſh at this Diſguiſe? have not the heavenly Deities deſcended to Earth, and changed their glorious Forms for Love?

If they who were Gods ſubmitted to that all-compelling Power, ſhall I, who am a Mortal, dare to rebel againſt it."</p>
                  <p>While the Prince was thus juſtifying the ſtrange Effects of his Paſſion by thoſe great Examples, he ſpied <hi>Fawnia</hi> at a Diſtance, running after one of her Sheep which had ſtrayed from the reſt: The Sight of that lovely Face ſuppreſt in a Moment all other Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but thoſe of Love and Joy.</p>
                  <p>He flew towards her, and ſhe, who did not know him in that Diſguiſe, but thought
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0451201402:38"/>
it was ſome genteel young Shepherd coming to meet her, ſecretly wiſhed it had been her Lot to have placed her Affections upon ſuch a one, whom with Reaſon ſhe might have loved, and hoped to have obtained.</p>
                  <p>The Prince's nearer Approach convinced her of her Miſtake, ſhe ſighed and bluſhed with Pleaſure and Surprize, and ſtopping curt'ſied to him with her uſual Gracefulneſs.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Egiſtus</hi> perceiving the unfeigned Simplicity with which ſhe told her Tale, diſmiſſed her; but reflected ſo deeply upon the diſhonourable Action his Son had committed, that he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fever, and continued ſo weak and ill that his Phyſicians had no Hopes of his Recovery.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> who regarded neither Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Country nor Crown, now he was in Poſſeſſion of his beloved <hi>Fawnia,</hi> never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf about the Grief his ſtrange Flight would occaſion the King and all the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> but reſigned himſelf wholly up to the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his preſent Happineſs, which he would not have quitted for all the Empires in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Winds for ſome Time ſeemed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their Flight, and they ſteered their Courſe to <hi>Italy</hi> without any Interruption; but one Morning the Sky began to be over-caſt with Clouds, the Winds grew high, the Sea ſwelled, and at laſt a Storm enſued, which raged during three Days with ſuch unceaſing Fury that the Ship was ſo much damaged the Sailors expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Moment it would ſink.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0451201402:51"/>Poor <hi>Fawnia</hi> was almoſt dying with her Fears, but the Sight of <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> who never left her a Moment, yielded her ſome Comfort amidſt the Horrors of approaching Death: On the fourth Morning the Storm abated, and the Sailors diſcovered Land, which they ſoon knew to be the Coaſt of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>

                  <p>Their confuſed Shouts of Joy gave <hi>Doraſtus</hi> to underſtand they were in Sight of ſome Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and with Tears of Joy and Tenderneſs he congratulated <hi>Fawnia</hi> on their Safety.</p>
                  <p>But when he was told it was the Coaſt of <hi>Bohemia</hi> upon which they were driven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering the Enmity there was between the King of that Country and his Father, whom he had ſought to poiſon, he was greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, not knowing what to do; or whether it was better to truſt to the Fury of the Winds and Waves than the Treachery and Cruelty of the inhuman <hi>Pandoſto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Capnio,</hi> who ſaw it was impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any Safety at Sea, adviſed the Prince to conceal his Name and Country and take up his Reſidence in ſome ſmall Village till they could procure a Ship to carry them to <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doraſtus</hi> approved this Scheme, and ordered <hi>Capnio</hi> to bid the Ship's Crew give out that his Name was <hi>Meleagrus,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palonia,</hi> and aſſure them in his Name of a large Reward for their Secrecy.</p>
                  <p>This done they went on Shore, and hired Lodgings at a Farm Houſe in a Village, a Mile diſtant from the chief City of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; as ſoon as they were recovered from the Fatigues

they had endured at Sea during the Storm, <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> impatient to be united to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Fawnia,</hi> gave <hi>Capnio</hi> Orders to make Preparations for their Marriage.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean time the Fame of <hi>Fawnia</hi>'s Beauty was ſpread through all the Village, and from thence reached the City, and at laſt the Court; nothing was talked of but the lovely Stranger, whoſe wonderful Beauty was the Subject of general Admiration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> though at that Time above ſixty Years old, was fired with the Reports he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually heard of this young Miracle, and was reſolved to ſee her; and being informed they affected great Privacy, and lodged in a very mean Houſe, he determined to have them ſeized on Suſpicion of their being Spies, and brought before him in order to be examined by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly he ſent a ſmall Party of his Guards to apprehend them, who coming to the Houſe where they lodged, informed them that they muſt come before the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> not in the leaſt daunted by this Meſſage, took <hi>Fawnia</hi> by the Hand, and leaving <hi>Porrus</hi> to take Care of the <hi>Treaſure,</hi> followed the Guards together with <hi>Capnio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being introduced to the King, they paid their Obeiſance to him with a reſpectful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that might have perſuaded him of their Innocence had he really ſuſpected them to have come into his Country with any bad Intention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0451201402:53"/>But the King, at the firſt Glance of <hi>Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed at her wonderful Beauty, that, forgetting what he had to do for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Minutes, he ſtood motionleſs like a Statue, not able to remove his Eyes from that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Object; recovering himſelf at laſt, he turned to <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> and aſked him ſternly who he was, of what Country, and with what Intent he had landed in <hi>Bohemia?</hi> "Sir, ſaid <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> with a Countenance unchanged, and a reſolute Tone of Voice, my Name is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagrus,</hi> a Knight, born and bred up in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palonia;</hi> this young Woman, whom I intend to make my Wife, is a Native of <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence I brought her; the Reaſon I have ſo ſmall a Train, is, that her Friends being unwilling to conſent to her Marriage, I took her away privately with an Intent to carry her to <hi>Trapalonia;</hi> as we were ſailing a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm aroſe which drove us upon this Coaſt, and I propoſe to ſtay no longer here than till our Ship is refitted, and put into a Condition to purſue her Voyage."</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> either not ſatisfied, or pretending not to be ſatisfied, with this Account, roſe from his Seat in a Rage; <hi>"Meleagrus,</hi> ſaid he, I am not to be impoſed upon by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely Tale; this Lady appears to be of a much higher Quality than you repreſent her, and by the graceful Lovelineſs of her Perſon, fitter to be the Wife of a great Prince, than a ſimple Knight, as you declare yourſelf to be."</p>
                  <p>"You have ſtolen away this young Lady from her unhappy Parents, like a falſe Traitor,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0451201402:54"/>
and as you have made them miſerable by your Theft, will, no doubt, ſhortly make her ſo too; therefore, till I can be thoroughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of her Birth, and till you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Certificate from <hi>Trapalonia</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Account you have given of yourſelf, I will detain ye all in <hi>Bohemia."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The noble Mind of <hi>Doraſtus</hi> could but ill brook the baſe Suſpicions and injurious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> and almoſt forgetting the Character he aſſumed he looked on him with a Frown of Anger and Diſdain, and with a haughty Accent thus replied:</p>
                  <p>"It is unworthy the Honour and Dignity of a Prince to reproach any Man with having committed ſcandalous Crimes without any Proof of his Guilt, or even Suſpicion to form a Belief on; inoffenſive Strangers ought to be treated with Kindneſs and Benevolence, not with Diſtruſt and Cruelty, which is contrary to the Laws of Nations, and the Cuſtoms of all civilized People; but the Gods will ſeverely revenge the Cauſe of thoſe, who, through In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to right themſelves, are obliged to put up with Wrongs and Injuries."</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pandoſto</hi> was ſo enraged at this bold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Language, that he immediately ordered his Guards to carry the audacious Stranger to Priſon, and likewiſe ordered all the Ship's Crew to be put in a cloſe Dungeon. For <hi>Fawnia</hi> he ordered an Apartment in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to be prepared, and recommended her to the Care of ſome of the Court Ladies.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Fawnia</hi> replied, "that ſhe would not purchaſe his Liberty, ardently as ſhe loved him, with the Loſs of her Honour," and <hi>Pandoſto</hi> ſeeing her ſo fixed in her Reſolution not to forſake <hi>Meleagrus,</hi> would preſs her no further at that Time, and left her to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Fawnia</hi> having thus given Vent to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sorrows of her Soul, retired to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment in the Palace, and paſt the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Hours in bewailing the Confinement of her beloved Prince, and offering up Prayers to the Gods for his Deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Mean Time <hi>Doraſtus</hi> in a cloſe Priſon, loaded with Irons like a common Criminal, and now a thouſand bitter Reflexions roſe in his Mind; Rage and Shame at the unworthy Treatment he received, made him ſometimes regret his ill placed Paſſion, which had brought him into ſo wretched a Condition.</p>
                  <p>But this Thought ſeldom dwelt long upon his Mind, and he was more ready to accuſe the Gods of Cruelty and Injuſtice for divide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and ſubjecting him to ſuch Miſeries, than to repent the Folly that had cauſed them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fawnia,</hi> with great Reluctance, ſuffered herſelf to be conducted to his Preſence, and the King, as ſoon as he ſaw her, ordered all his Attendants to withdraw, and with a ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Look and Voice thus ſpoke to her.</p>
                  <p>"Well, charming <hi>Fawnia,</hi> have you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon the Purport of my laſt Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you, when we walked together in the Park? are you become leſs obſtinate, and more wiſe?

                  <p>"My Lord, replied <hi>Fawnia,</hi> I am ſenſible that I am in your Power, and have indeed ſeverely felt the arbitrary Exertion of it; is it juſt, is it reaſonable, my Lord, to inflict upon innocent Perſons ſuch Puniſhments as are only due to guilty ones? What Crime has <hi>Meleagrus</hi> committed againſt you that he muſt be loaded with Chains and confined in a horrible Priſon? And what Right have you over my Perſon, that you detain me here in your Palace, and force me to liſten to your infamous Propoſals? <hi>Meleagrus</hi> has never attempted to ſeduce your Subjects from their Allegiance to you; why then do you attempt to allure me from the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity I owe to him? but know, unjuſt Prince, though Fortune has put my Perſon in your

                     <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> enraged at her unalterable Love for <hi>Meleagrus,</hi> and fixed Reſolution to refuſe his Offer, ordered her, with Eyes ſparkling with Fury, to quit his Preſence, ſwearing at the ſame Time that unleſs ſhe diſpoſed herſelf ſoon to yield to his Deſires, he would force her to comply, whatever might be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fawnia,</hi> not in the leaſt terrified at his Menaces, quitted his Apartment and retired to her own, arming her Soul with Fortitude to eſcape his threatened Force by Death, if Heaven afforded her not ſome other Means of Relief.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> was informed by ſome <hi>Bohemian</hi> Merchants, who had diſcovered <hi>Meleagrus</hi> to be <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> that his Son was in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and confined in Priſon by the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> though extremely offended with his Son for his Diſobedience and Deſertion of him, yet could not hear of the ſhameful Treatment he received from <hi>Pandoſto</hi> without feeling great Affliction; and reflecting that <hi>Bellaria</hi> and himſelf had been cleared by the Oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi> of the Crime the King ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them guilty of, he did not doubt but <hi>Pandoſto</hi> would ſend back his fugitive Son, at the Requeſt of his Ambaſſadors.</p>
                  <p>He therefore ordered a ſmall Fleet, well manned to be prepared, and giving a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſome of his principal Nobles to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

the Prince of <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> they embarked and ſet ſail for <hi>Bohemia.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pandoſto</hi> received the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Ambaſſadors with great Reſpect, which filled them with Hopes of returning to their Maſter with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and ſoon after their Arrival related to them the Adventure of the <hi>Trapalonian</hi> Knight, who he ſaid had come into his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in a very ſuſpicious Manner, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him a young Lady, named <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and no Attendants but a Shepherd, and an old Man.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſadors immediately perceived this <hi>Trapalonian</hi> Knight was no other than their Prince <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> but they diſſembled the Matter for the preſent till the King granted them a public Audience, and then in the Name of their Sovereign they demanded the Prince of <hi>Sicily</hi> of him, who was in his Dominions under the Name of <hi>Meleagrus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They then proceeded to acquaint his <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Majeſty that the Prince of <hi>Sicily</hi> had contrary to the Will of the King his Father, quitted the Kingdom, and carried with him a young Maid, named <hi>Fawnia,</hi> the Daughter of an old Shepherd, called <hi>Porrus,</hi> and that <hi>Capnio,</hi> one of the Prince's Attendants, had accompanied him in his Flight.</p>
                  <p>They concluded with telling the King that it was the Requeſt of their Sovereign <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> that Prince <hi>Doraſtus</hi> ſhould be freed from his Confinement and ſent home with them, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0451201402:65"/>
that <hi>Capnio, Porrus,</hi> and his Daughter, <hi>Fawnia,</hi> ſhould be put to Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pandoſto</hi> heard this Embaſſy with great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment, and willing to reconcile himſelf to <hi>Egiſtus,</hi> and to ſhew how much he deſired to renew their long interrupted Friendſhip, he reſolved punctually to execute his Will, and to ſacrifice <hi>Fawnia</hi> both to his Policy and his injured Love.</p>
                  <p>He therefore ſent Orders immediately for the Releaſe of <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> who was greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this unexpected Favour, but he was ſtill more ſo, when being conducted into the King's Preſence, he ſaw ſeveral Noblemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Father's Court, who, as ſoon as he appeared, approached, and paid their Duties to him with the utmoſt Reſpect.</p>

                     <hi>Pandoſto</hi> riſing from his Chair of State em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him with many Expreſſions of Tender-and Reſpect, mingling Apologies for what had paſſed, while his Birth and Quality were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, then ſeating him on his right Hand, he declared to him the Purport of the Embaſſy, he had received from the King, his Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> in great Confuſion to find the Cauſe of his Flight was thus publickly known, held down his Head to hide the Bluſhes which overſpread his Face, but when the King went on to relate the Puniſhment that he was required to inflict upon <hi>Fawnia</hi> and that other Partners of his Flight, he was not able to conceal the ſtrong Emotions of his

Soul, but in the moſt paſſionate Terms he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt the Cruelty and Injuſtice of his Father, and earneſtly conjured <hi>Pandoſto</hi> not to execute ſo inhuman a Sentence.</p>
                  <p>The King, without being moved by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, ordered <hi>Fawnia, Capnio,</hi> and <hi>Porrus</hi> to be brought before him, and giving Way to the Fury of his Reſentment againſt <hi>Fawnia,</hi> whoſe noble Reſiſtance had changed the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Love he bore her into Hatred, he accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the trembling Maid with theſe reproachful Words.</p>
                  <p>"Mean and contemptible Wretch, ſaid he, how durſt thou raiſe thy dazled Eyes to Honour, and in thy baſe born Soul nouriſh the Flames of Ambition. Was it for thee, thou Beggar, to entertain Hopes of marrying a Prince? and practiſe Arts to induce the Son of a great King to forſake his Country to gratify thy inſolent Deſires? but know, thou dangerous Syren, Death ſhall be the Reward of thy daring Ambition; and thou old doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fool, ſaid he, to the pale trembling <hi>Porrus,</hi> whoſe inſolent Folly has prompted thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to this raſh Undertaking, thy Life ſhall pay for thy Preſumption."</p>
                  <p>"But for thee, <hi>Capnio,</hi> added the enraged King, Death is too eaſy a Puniſhment, thy Treaſon and Falſhood merits ſomething worſe, I therefore condemn thee to have thy Eyes put out, and till thou dieſt grind continually in a Mill, like a blind Horſe."</p>

                     <hi>Doraſtus,</hi> whom the Sentence that was paſt on <hi>Fawnia,</hi> had thrown into a ſilent Agony of Grief, Rage, and Deſpair, perceiving they were about to lead her away, roſe up to ſpeak in her Defence, but overcome with the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe different Emotions, he ſunk down again in his Chair, without any Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Life.</p>
                  <p>By the timely Aſſiſtance of the King's Phyſicians he recovered, his Senſes, and at their Inſtances, he was removed from the Sight of <hi>Fawnia,</hi> who, as ſoon as he was taken out of the Room, ſpoke in this Manner.</p>

certain Day, one of my Sheep ſtraying down to the Sea-ſide, I went to look for it, and ſaw a little Boat driven upon the Sands, wherein I found a Babe, about ſix Days old, wrapt in a ſcarlet Mantle, with a Chain about its Neck: Compaſſion moved me to take Care of the Child, and being covetous of the Treaſure I had found with it, I carried it home to my Wife, who nurſed it as her own, and when it grew up ſet it to keep Sheep; this Lady, <hi>Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> is the Child whom I found, and here is the Chain and the Jewels that were about her; who ſhe is, and of what Parentage, I know not, but I ſolemnly declare ſhe is not mine."</p>

               </p>
               <p>It has been mentioned as a great Praiſe to <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> that the old paltry Story of <hi>Doraſtus</hi> and <hi>Fawnia</hi> ſerved him for a Winter's Tale, but if we compare the Conduct of the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the Play with the paltry Story on which it is founded, we ſhall find the Original much leſs abſurd and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> had even improved the Story, and cleared it of great Part of its Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, yet he would ſtill have been accountable for what remained, for why indeed did he chuſe a Subject ſo faulty for the Story of a Play; his Claim to Praiſe would have been but very ſmall, by making what was bad bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince he was free in the Choice of his Subject; but certainly he can have no Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to it at all by changing bad to worſe; that he has done ſo will be eaſily proved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining ſome of the principal Incidents, as they are differently managed by the Noveliſt and the Poet.</p>
               <p>The King's Jealouſy is the Foundation of all the Adventures that followed, but extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant as its Conſequences are in both, yet the Riſe and Progreſs of this terrible Paſſion is better accounted for in the Novel than the Play: In the firſt we are told that <hi>Pandoſto,</hi> charmed with the friendly Viſit <hi>Egiſtus</hi> paid him in his Dominions, deſired the Queen to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0451201402:77"/>
treat her royal Gueſt with, the Reſpect and Eſteem that was due to his Merit and the Friendſhip he had for him; the Queen, like an obedient Wife, complies with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Directions, and perhaps over-acts her Part. The King begins to think he has been too officious; the innocent Familiarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Wife and Friend creates Suſpicions, which meeting with a Mind prepared by a natural Diſtruſtfulneſs to receive them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces thoſe Sparks of Jealouſy which his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Obſervations on all their Looks, Words, and Actions, afterwards blew into a Flame.</p>
               <p>This Account of the King's Jealouſy does not abſolutely claſh with Probability. But let us ſee how <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> manages it in the Play; the two Kings make their firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the ſecond Scene in high Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Confidence; <hi>Polixenes</hi> reminding his Friend of the Length of his Viſit, tells him he is now reſolved to be gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leontes,</hi> not able to part with him, preſſes him earneſtly to ſtay longer, <hi>Polixenes</hi> urges the Neceſſity of his ſpeedy Departure, and truly, as he obſerves, nine Months is a great while for a good King to be out of his own Dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leontes,</hi> after many fruitleſs Intreaties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches his Queen for not endeavouring to detain <hi>Polixenes,</hi> ſhe, in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, preſſes him to gratify her Lord by a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0451201402:78"/>
little longer Stay; <hi>Polixenes</hi> complies at her Requeſt, and certainly he muſt be a very ill bred Monarch had he done otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>All this Converſation paſſes in the Preſence of <hi>Leontes,</hi> who from hence takes Occaſion to be jealous, and paſſes in an Inſtant from the greateſt Confidence, Security, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip imaginable, to the laſt Extremity of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and Rage. What wonderful Contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is here? The Legerdemain, who ſhews you a Tree that buds Bloſſoms and bears ripe Fruit in the Space of five Minutes, does not put ſo great a Cheat on the Senſes, as <hi>Shakeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> does on the Underſtanding; for this Jealouſy of one Minute's Growth we ſee take Root before our Eyes, and ſo far from there being the ſmalleſt Progreſſion in the ſeveral Actions of budding, bloſſoming, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ripe Fruit, that we have the firſt and the laſt at one and the ſame Inſtant.</p>
               <p>The extravagant Effects of the King's Rage and Jealouſy are carried far enough in all Conſcience in the Novel, and <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> is not a Whit more moderate; only he has altered a Circumſtance which entirely deſtroys the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Probability the Noveliſt had preſerved in the Relation.</p>
               <p>In the Story, the King being in his own Mind firmly perſuaded of the Queen's Guilt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>She inſiſts upon being confronted with her Accuſers, whereupon ſhe is brought to a Tryal; but finding ſhe was likely to meet with no Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in a Court over-ruled by the Power of her Huſband, ſhe on her Knees proteſts her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and intreats the King to conſult the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> concerning the Crimes of which ſhe was accuſed. This ſo reaſonable a Requeſt being made in open Court, the King could not refuſe it, and therefore ſends Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to <hi>Delphos;</hi> who return with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the God; which being read, declares her Innocence, and the King is ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes the King in the Heighth of his Frenzy of Jealouſy ſend himſelf to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and in the mean Time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the moſt barbarous Cruelties on his Queen and Child. How inconſiſtent is this! why does he conſult the Oracle if he is reſolved to proceed to Extremities before the Anſwer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives? The Requeſt comes very naturally from the Queen in the Novel, and the King's Compliance with it is very well accounted for, but in the Play nothing can be more abſurd than that the King ſhould be reaſonable enough to conſult voluntarily the Gods concerning the Infidelity of his Wife; and while the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was expected, and her Guilt yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, puniſh her with as much Rigour as if the Oracle had declared her an Adultreſs.

again the paltry Story has the Advantage of the Play. Let us go on to examine a few more of the Incidents.</p>

               <p>In the Play, it is a Nobleman of high Rank, who had Courage enough to reprove the King for his violent and unjuſt Jealouſy, yet baſely ſubmits to take an Oath to perform his Commands, though he had Reaſon to think they would not be very mild, and ſtill more baſely keeps that Oath, though it enjoins him to carry the innocent Babe to a Deſert, and there leave it to the Mercy of the wild Beaſts.</p>
               <p>In the Novel, the Accidents that happen to the expoſed Infant are governed by Chance; the Boat into which it was put being left in the midſt of the Ocean, is driven by the Winds to the Coaſt of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and being ſpied by a Shepherd is drawn to Land.</p>
               <p>In the Play, <hi>Antigonous,</hi> who is bound by Oath to leave the Child in ſome deſert Place quite out of its Father's Dominions, is warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Dream by its unhappy Mother to call the Infant <hi>Perdita,</hi> and carry it to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and there leave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antigonous</hi> obeys, and this done, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary he ſhould never return to <hi>Sicily,</hi> otherwiſe it may be diſcovered where the Princeſs is left, and all the future Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would fall to the Ground, therefore a Bear ruſhes out of the Woods and devours
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0451201402:81"/>
him; the good-natured Bear, as it ſhould ſeem, reſolved not to ſpoil the Story, paſſes by the little Princeſs, who is to make ſo great a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure hereafter, and a convenient Storm ariſing, ſplits the Ship in which ſhe was brought thither, ſo that all the Sailors periſhing, though they were near enough the Shore to have ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, no one is left to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry back any Account of the Affair to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and thereby prevent the Adventures which are to follow.</p>
               <p>All this is very wonderful: <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies Miracle upon Miracle to bring about the ſame Events in the Play, which Chance, with much more Propriety, performs in the Novel.</p>
               <p>The Loves of the young Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and the royal Shepherdeſs are carried on much in the ſame Manner by the Poet as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſt; <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has even borrowed ſome of the Thoughts from the latter in this Speech of <hi>Florizel</hi> to <hi>Perdita.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>The Gods themſelves,</l>
                  <l>Humbling their Deities to Love, have taken</l>
                  <l>The Shapes of Beaſts upon them. <hi>Jupiter</hi>

                  <l>Golden <hi>Apollo,</hi> a poor humble Swain,</l>
                  <l>As I ſeem now. Their Transformations</l>
                  <l>Were never for a Piece of Beauty rarer,</l>
                  <l>Nor in a Way ſo chaſte. Since my Deſires</l>
                  <l>Run not before my Honour, nor my Luſts</l>
                  <l>Burn hotter than my Faith.</l>

               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0451201402:82"/>
                  <hi>Doraſtus</hi> ſpeaks almoſt the ſame Words in the Novel, "The Gods themſelves have not diſdained to love: <hi>Jupiter</hi> was enamoured of <hi>Danaë,</hi> and the bright <hi>Apollo</hi> woo'd the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable <hi>Daphne;</hi> theſe were mortal Beauties, and they were Deities; why then, though a Prince, may not I love a Shepherdeſs, but their Paſſions were diſhonourable, mine is pure and chaſte, 'tis true, and herein I ſurpaſs the Gods; be ſtill then, O my Soul, for 'tis decreed, <hi>Fawnia,</hi> the adorable <hi>Fawnia,</hi> ſhall be mine."</p>
               <p>The Eſcape of the two Lovers is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently managed in the Novel and Play; in the firſt, the Prince being preſſed by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to marry, reſolves to leave <hi>Sicily</hi> with <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and fly into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live concealed till his Father's Death, or that he could reconcile him to his Marriage with the beautiful Shepherdeſs; having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a Ship, and a ſufficient Quantity of Money and Jewels, he meets <hi>Fawnia</hi> early in the Morning and carries her to the Port, they embark, and ſteer their Courſe for <hi>Italy,</hi> but are driven by contrary Winds to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where they are obliged to land.</p>
               <p>In the Play, <hi>Florizel</hi> diſguiſed in the Habit of a Shepherd for the Sake of <hi>Perdita,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts at a Sheepſhearing Feaſt. The King, his Father, being informed of his Son's Reſort to the Houſe of a Shepherd, goes there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed with his Confidant, <hi>Camillo,</hi> and comes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0451201402:83"/>
very opportunely to hear the Prince, his Son declare his Paſſion for the Fair Shepherdeſs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly, and his Intentions of marrying her; nay he carries his Indiſcretion ſo far as to join Hands with her before all the Country People who are preſent; can any Thing be more abſurd?</p>
               <p>The King, ſufficiently informed of his Son's Deſigns, diſcovers himſelf, and forbids the Bans: this is indeed a terrible Stroke; one would be puzzled to think how the Lovers will eſcape; for is it not natural to ſuppoſe that the enraged King will keep his Son in a ſtrict Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement to prevent this unequal Match; but it happens quite otherwiſe; for the King, after ſome ſevere Menaces, goes back to his Palace, and leaves his Son at Liberty to run away with the Country Girl, which he accordingly does.</p>
               <p>The Part <hi>Camillo</hi> acts in this Affair is not more conſiſtent; he longs to ſee again his old Maſter <hi>Leontes</hi> and his native Country <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia,</hi> which he had quitted to preſerve <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixenes,</hi> and becauſe this Monarch loved him ſo well that he could not bear his Abſence, and gently denied him Permiſſion to go, <hi>Camillo</hi> betrays the Confidence he repoſed in him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the Prince's Flight, and adviſes him to take Refuge in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> in Hopes that <hi>Polixenes,</hi> to whom he intended to diſcover where the Prince was gone, would follow him, and thus he might again return to his own Country.</p>
               <p>This double Treachery and ſelf-intereſted Views are very inconſiſtent with the Character
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0451201402:84"/>
of ſo honeſt a Man as <hi>Camillo</hi> is repreſented to be; beſides the Contrivance is abſolutely ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; for what Reaſon had the Prince to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Leontes,</hi> who paſſionately deſired to be reconciled to the King his Father, whom he had ſo greatly injured, would offend him anew by protecting his Son, who had fled from him in order to marry a poor Shepherdeſs, for he could not expect the Story, however he diſguiſed it, would be long concealed from him; and why ſhould <hi>Camillo</hi> ſuppoſe that <hi>Polixenes,</hi> when he was informed of his Son's Flight, would quit his Dominions to follow him, and put his Perſon again in the Power of a King who had once deſigned to murder him: was it not more likely that he would ſend Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to demand the Prince of <hi>Leontes,</hi> who would then have an Opportunity of ſhewing if his Penitence was ſincere by ſending him back again; but <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has fallen into all theſe Abſurdities in order to bring the chief Characters in his Play together at <hi>Sicilia,</hi> tho' for ſome of them there was not the leaſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral Incidents that lead to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Fawnia</hi> are conducted with ſome Shadow of Probability in the Novel, but are much the worſe for <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Alterations.</p>
               <p>In the Novel <hi>Capnio,</hi> the Prince's Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as he is haſtening after him to the Port, meets the Father of <hi>Fawnia</hi> going to Court,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0451201402:85"/>
and ſuſpecting his Deſign, he artfully perſuades him to follow him, and, partly by Stratagem, and partly by Force, carries him on board the Veſſel in which the Prince and <hi>Fawnia</hi> were embarked; the old Man had taken with him when he left his Houſe the Chain and Jewels he found with <hi>Fawnia</hi> in order to ſhew them to the King and relate the Manner in which he found her; but being prevented in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by <hi>Capnio,</hi> who obliged him to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of their Flight, he very prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to conceal from <hi>Fawnia</hi> the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her Birth; and, to ſecure to himſelf a reſpectful Treatment from the Prince and her, ſuffers her ſtill to believe him her Father; but when at <hi>Bohemia</hi> the King of <hi>Sicilia</hi>'s Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors diſcover who they are, and the old Shepherd and <hi>Fawnia</hi> are by the King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> ordered to be put to Death for deluding the Prince of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he then declares that <hi>Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> is not his Daughter, and produces the Chain and Jewels he found with her as Proofs that her Birth was not mean; the King at the Sight of theſe Tokens knows and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his Daughter.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe Circumſtances are altered by <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>—The Prince having changed Cloaths with a cheating Pedlar, eſcapes with his Miſtreſs to the Ship; the Pedlar imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately over-hears a Converſation between the reputed Father of <hi>Perdita</hi> and his Son, in which it is reſolved that he ſhall carry the Jewels to the King and declare how he found <hi>Perdita;</hi> the Pedlar ſuppoſing it would be an
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0451201402:86"/>
Advantage to the Prince to know this, decoys the old Shepherd and his Son aboard; now one would imagine that all muſt come out; but ſee what ſtrange Accidents conſpire to hinder it.</p>
               <p>The Pedlar, though he over-heard the old Shepherd ſay that <hi>Perdita</hi> was a Foundling and not his Daughter, neglects to tell the Prince this important Circumſtance, though it was with that very Deſign he came and forced the two Clowns along with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perdita,</hi> though her Father and Brother are in the ſame Veſſel with her, never ſees or ſpeaks to them: the old Shepherd and his Son make no Attempts to ſpeak to her; and the Prince has ſo little Conſideration for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Brother of his Beloved that he takes no Notice of them; how wonderful is all this! the moſt unlikely Things imaginable fall out to poſtpone the Diſcovery of <hi>Perdita</hi> till their Arrival at <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Novel makes the Wife of the jealous King die through Affliction for the Loſs of her Son; <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſeems to have preſerved her alive for the ſake of her repreſenting her own Statue in the laſt Scene; a mean and abſurd Contrivance; for how can it be imagined that <hi>Hermione,</hi> a virtuous and affectionate Wife, would conceal herſelf during ſixteen Years in a ſolitary Houſe, though ſhe was ſenſible that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

away with Grief and Remorſe for her Death; and what Reaſon could ſhe have for chuſing to live in ſuch a miſerable Confinement, when ſhe might have been happy in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her Huſband's Affection and have ſhared his Throne: how ridiculous alſo in a great Queen, on ſo interreſting an Occaſion, to ſubmit to ſuch Buffoonery as ſtanding on a Pedeſtal, motionleſs, her Eyes fixed, and at laſt to be conjured down by this magical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Paulina.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Muſic, awake her; ſtrike;</l>
                  <l>'Tis Time, deſcend; be Stone no more; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;</l>

                  <l>I'll fill your Grave; up ſtir; nay, come away;</l>
                  <l>Bequeath to Death your Numbneſs, for from him</l>
                  <l>Dear Life redeems you.</l>
               </q>
               <p>After this ſolemn Incantation, her Majeſty comes down from the Pedeſtal and embraces her Huſband, and her new found Daughter, for whoſe Sake ſhe declares ſhe had preſerved her Life.</p>
               <p>To bring about this Scene, ridiculous as it is, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has been guilty of many Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, which would be too tedious to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which are too glaring to eſcape the Obſervation of the moſt careleſs Reader.</p>
               <p>The Novel has nothing in it half ſo low and improbable as this Contrivance of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0451201402:88"/>
Statue; and indeed wherever <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has altered or invented, his <hi>Winter</hi>'s <hi>Tale</hi> is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferior to the old paltry Story that furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the Subject of it.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer,</hi> in his Edition of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> has this Note at the Beginning of the <hi>Winter Tale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Country, here called <hi>Bithynia,</hi> hath in all former Editions been printed <hi>Bohemia,</hi> an inland Kingdom, ſituated nearly in the Center of <hi>Europe</hi>; whereas many of the great Incidents of the Play turn upon its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a maritime Country, of which <hi>Polixenes</hi> was the King. This is a Blunder and an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, of which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> in Juſtice ought not to be thought capable, and as he hath turned quite anew the Story contained in the old paltry Book of <hi>Doraſtus</hi> and <hi>Fawnia,</hi> changing moſt of the main Circumſtances, and all the Names of the Perſons; it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he removed this Impropriety, and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scene in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> which the Ignorance and Negligence of the firſt Tranſcribers, or Printers, might corrupt and bring back again to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by a leſs Variation in the Letters than they have been guilty of in numberleſs other Places of this Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> in his Two Gentlemen of <hi>Verona,</hi> makes <hi>Protheus</hi> travel from <hi>Verona</hi> to <hi>Milan</hi> by Sea. Yet both thoſe Cities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and both more than eighty Miles diſtant from the Sea. Unleſs this Blunder can be alſo charged upon the Tranſcribers, or Printers, 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe that <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> who was guilty of the one, might be ſo of the other.</p>

                  <p>I Begin, Gentlemen, with telling you that I wiſh you all as well as myſelf; here is a Comedy of <hi>Plautus</hi> which I bring you, and intreat you will give it a favourable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; liſten now to the Subject of the Play, and be ſilent, I ſhall endeavour to compriſe it in as few Words as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>'Tis cuſtomary with Poets in their Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to make one believe that all paſſes at <hi>Athens,</hi> to the End that the Subject may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear entirely <hi>Grecian,</hi> and may be more eſteemed by the Spectators; as for me I ſhall not pretend to ſay that what we are going to repreſent here to Day happened in any other Place than where it really did.</p>
                  <p>The Subject of this Piece is truly <hi>Grecian,</hi> yet notwithſtanding that it is not <hi>Attick,</hi> but <hi>Sicilian,</hi> and what I have hitherto ſaid is only the Introduction to it.</p>
                  <p>In explaining the Argument to you I ſhall not amuſe myſelf with ſhewing you Patterns only, but preſent you with the whole Piece, for it is my Intention to be very full in the Expoſition of this Intrigue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0451201402:92"/>There was formerly at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> a good plain ſimple Man, a Merchant by Profeſſion, his Wife was delivered of two Sons at one Birth, who ſo perfectly reſembled each other, that the Nurſe who ſuckled them, and the Mother who bore them were not able to diſtinguiſh the one from the other. This I was told by a Perſon who ſaw them; for my own Part I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſee them, and I tell you ſo that you may not be deceived.</p>
                  <p>When theſe two Children arrived to the Age of ſeven Years, their Father took one of them with him on board a Veſſel which he had loaded with Merchandize, and carried him to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> whither he went to trade, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other at home with his Mother.</p>
                  <p>It happened that when they arrived at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum</hi> they were celebrating Games, which, as it is uſual with public Spectacles, drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether great Numbers of People.</p>
                  <p>The little Boy ſtraying from his Father was taken up by a Merchant of <hi>Epidamnum,</hi> who carried him into his own Country; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Affliction for the Loſs of his Son was ſo great that it deprived him of his Senſes, and a few Days after of his Life.</p>
                  <p>This News being carried to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> the Grandfather of the two Children underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one of them was taken away at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi> and that the Father was dead, changed the Name of his Grandſon who remained with him, and gave him that of his Brother that was loſt, whom he had loved extremely and was deſirous of preſerving the Remembrance
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0451201402:93"/>
of; he called him therefore <hi>Menaechmus,</hi> a Name that was common to himſelf as well as to the Twins.</p>
                  <p>This Circumſtance I remember very well, having heard it proclaimed by the public Criers; and that you may avoid Miſtakes, I inform you beforehand, that theſe twin Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have both the ſame Name.</p>

                           <p>IN my Opinion, my dear <hi>Meſſenion,</hi> theſe Sea-fearing Men know no greater Pleaſure in the World than when after a long Voyage, they firſt diſcover Land.</p>

                           <p>We are come hither in Search of a Brother, a Twin Brother, whom I look upon as one half of myſelf.</p>

Had we been ſeeking for a Needle in a Bundle of Hay we ſhould have found it by this Time, provided it was not inviſible. In vain do we hope to find a dead Man amongſt the Living, for if he were ſtill in Being, ſhou'd we not have met with ſome one e'er now who cou'd have given ſome Intelligence of him?</p>

                           <p>I am determin'd never to give over my Search till I have found my Brother, or met with ſome Perſon, who having known him, can certainly inform me that he is dead. This pining Anxiety will then be at an End, and I will return to <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> but till I have that Satisfaction, while Life animates this Body I will not ceaſe to wander about the World, and ſeek him every where; too ſenſibly do I feel the Force of fraternal Affection to quit eaſily the Hope of ſeeing my Brother again.</p>

                           <p>DURING theſe thirty Years, which I have lived, I have never been guilty of ſo wicked, ſo unhappy an Action as this Day; my cruel Deſtiny led me into an Aſſembly, where, while I loſt my Time in gaping and ſtaring about me, <hi>Menaechmus</hi> eſcaped me. Ah! without Doubt he is gone to the Houſe of his Miſtreſs, and was not willing that I ſhou'd accompany him, and be a Witneſs of his Pleaſures: May the Gods pour down their fierceſt Wrath upon him who firſt introduced Aſſemblies, and thereby hindered People who have important Affairs upon their Hands from purſuing their Buſineſs. Aſſemblies ought only to be compoſed of indolent and idle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch ought to be ſummoned to appear, and when they don't obey, be puniſhed by large Fines. A great many of the Inhabitants of this City eat always alone, and in private. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, wholly uſeleſs to their Country, who
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0451201402:136"/>
have never performed the leaſt Service to the Commonwealth, mean ſordid Wretches, that invite no Perſon to their Table, and are never invited to others. Such as theſe ought regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to aſſiſt at Aſſemblies and public Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                           <p>If this excellent Order, this uſeful Cuſtom had been obſerved, I ſhou'd not to Day have had the Misfortune of loſing ſo plentiful and delicious a Repaſt, for I am as well aſſured that <hi>Menaechmus</hi> had once a Deſign to treat me this Day, as I am among the Number of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. However I will go to him as late as it is, I have always Hopes of finding ſome Remains of the Feaſt; this Thought alone conſoles me, and raiſes my depreſs'd Spirits; but is not that <hi>Menaechmus</hi> himſelf that I ſee? he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with a Crown of Flowers on his Head, ah! miſerable that I am, the Feaſt is finiſh'd, they are riſen from Table, by all the Furies!

                           <p>We have a Cuſtom here that is no leſs fooliſh than troubleſome, and yet the wiſeſt and beſt of us continue to obſerve it exactly, we are extremely deſirous of having a great Number of Dependants, and of being perpetually ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited

by Clients, but never give ourſelves the Trouble to enquire whether they are good or bad; we never concern ourſelves about their Probity, their Integrity, or the Merit of their Cauſe; all we deſire to know is if they are rich. If the Client is poor, though his Behaviour be ever ſo unexceptionable, yet he paſſes for a Man who has very bad Principles; if he be rich, however wicked and baſe his Life and Manners, yet we extol him for a Man of great Virtue; there are ſome who regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law or Equity, who are continually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting their Patrons, who deny to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what has been given them, and who having acquired large Fortunes by Uſury and ſwearing falſely, delight in continually involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves and others in Lawſuits; when they have determined on a Day to have their Cauſes pleaded, they acquaint their Advocates or Patrons with it, and whatever Crimes they have committed, they muſt defend them whether the Cauſe be pleaded before the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, before the Pretor, or before the Judge.</p>
                           <p>A Client of this Sort has been the Cauſe of all my Mortification to Day; he diſappointed me in all my Deſigns, and robb'd me of thoſe Hours I had reſolved to dedicate to Pleaſure, I have pleaded for him before the Ediles, and after a great deal of wicked Diſputation I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the adverſe Party Conditions equally cruel and unjuſt, and mindful of my Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, went no farther in my Pleading than what was juſt neceſſary to form an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement

upon<note n="§" place="margin">The Pleaders on both Sides were obliged to lay down a certain Sum of Money, which each Party looked upon as the Reward of Victory, this Money was called a Fine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the deſign'd Puniſhment of a Law-ſuit unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaken.</note>. Well what did my Client? Why he gave Security. I proteſt I never ſaw a Man ſo clearly, ſo manifeſtly convicted; the Crimes he was accuſed of were proved upon him by three Witneſſes.

                           <p>I ordered a good Repaſt to be prepared, and I know my Miſtreſs waits for me with great Impatience, I could not help this Delay, I left the Aſſembly as ſoon as poſſible, I do not doubt but <hi>Erotia</hi> will be extremely offended, but ſhe will be appeaſed by reflecting on the fine Robe I ſtole from my Wife to preſent to her.</p>

If my Wife is offended I have the Conſolation to think that my <hi>Erotia</hi> will receive me with open Arms; ſhe will not baniſh me from her, no, ſhe will welcome me with Tranſport—I will go to her immediately, and intreat her to give me back this curſed Robe which has occaſioned ſo much Noiſe, and I will buy her a better. Hollo, who is there, what neither Porter nor Portreſs? open the Door, I ſay, and tell your Miſtreſs I am here.</p>

                        <head>SCENE II.</head>
                        <stage>The Old Man, Father-in-law of MENAECH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUS of <hi>Epidamnum,</hi> the Wife of the ſame, and MENAECHMUS SOSICLES.</stage>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
                           <p>I am going to my Daughter's Houſe as faſt as my great Age will permit me, but well I know this Walk will be very difficult, for every Step is ſlower than the former, I ſink under the Weight of Years, and drag a heavy Body, which my Limbs are hardly able to ſupport; my Strength is almoſt gone, I carry my Years on my Back like bad Merchandize, for this wicked old Age, whenever it comes, brings with it a great many Followers, a Croud of Inconveniencies and natural Defects; in ſhort, old Age is ſubject to ſo many Miſeries that if I undertook to recount them I ſhou'd die before the Detail was ended. But beſides the Pain of being old, which is not ſmall, I am aſſaulted by a new Affliction that touches me ſenſibly; my Daughter has ſent for me in a violent Hurry, ſhe intreats that I will come immediately; what can be the occaſion of this Meſſage? what Accident has happened? my Imagination repreſents a thouſand different Things to me, all equally tormenting.</p>
                           <p>But what I am moſt ſurpriſed at is, that my Daughter has ſent only a general Meſſage, which gives me no Light into the Affair. Ah! ſhe wou'd have done better to have ſpared
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0451201402:171"/>
me this Anxiety by informing me exactly what the Buſineſs is. Mean Time I conjecture, I divine, and I am much deceived if I am not right, ſome new Family Storm, ſome domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Hurricane has occaſioned this Meſſage. Women who bring large Portions to their Huſbands expect to make them wear the Yoke; theſe Women I ſay are generally very bad, and if the poor Huſband endeavours but ever ſo little to maintain his Right of Superiority, the Houſe will be always full of Noiſe; the Huſbands indeed often abuſe their Power, and then 'tis they who are in the wrong. To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conjugal State happy, 'tis neceſſary that the Authority of the Huſband ought to be exerted with Prudence; and the Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wife be bounded by Reaſon; by <hi>Pollux!</hi> it certainly is not for any trivial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that my Drughter has ſent for me, 'tis ſomething of Conſequence, but whatever it is I ſhall know preſently. Ha! do I not ſee this Couple before the Door of their Houſe; the Huſband has a diſcontented Air, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs is painted in his Countenance, how well have I gueſs'd! they are quarrelling, ah! I am ſeldom deceived. I muſt begin my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition by firſt ſpeaking to the Wife.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0451201402:172"/>
does your Huſband look ſo angrily on you? you have certainly had a Battle between you, at leaſt with your Tongues; tell me truly, Daughter, which of you two is moſt in Fault? and merits moſt the paternal Cenſure? tell me in few Words all I ought to be acquainted with, either as Judge or Mediator.</p>

                           <p>Is he ſo! faith I like him the better for it, and to reward you for your Diligence in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering this Intrigue, I will do my beſt to forward it, and engage your Spouſe in new Gallantries.</p>

                           <p>But alas, Sir! his Debaucheries are not confined to Women alone, he drinks there to Exceſs, and buries himſelf in Voluptuouſneſs in this infamous Brothel.</p>

                           <p>What is it to you where he drinks? how far will you carry your Inſolence? why do you not forbid him to go abroad, or to invite any Perſon to his Table? Do you expect that Huſbands will relinquiſh their Authority, and take Pleaſure in ſerving their Wives, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Slaves to their unreaſonable Wills; you might with equal Juſtice expect your Huſband to ſit amongſt your Maids and ſpin.</p>

                           <p>Alas, Father! you did not come I find to be my Patron; my Meſſage has procured a good Advocate for my Huſband? you are here indeed at my Requeſt, but you plead only againſt me.</p>

ſeverely than I have done you, from his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate I ſhall become his Accuſer; but ſince I find that he ſupplies you with every Thing you want, and maintains you in Elegance and Splendor, in my Opinion, a Woman of Senſe ought to be contented with theſe Proofs of Affection, and endeavour to merit them by Sweetneſs and Complacency.</p>

                           <p>Oh! if he does ſo he does very ill, but on the other Side, if this ſhould be a Falſhood, a Calumny, you are guilty of a moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crime, in thus aſperſing the Innocence of your Spouſe.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0451201402:193"/>
Symptoms of this Diſtemper. Is this black Suſpicion owing to Malice or Miſtake? 'Tis ſtrange! 'tis unaccountable! ſurely I am not mad. I neither inſult, quarrel with, or ſtrike any Perſons that come in my way; my Mind is calm, my Thoughts are reaſonable; my Behaviour is not different from other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; when I ſpeak to them they reply, when they ſpeak to me I anſwer them again, and with as much Judgment as ever I did before.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am always ready to obey my Maſter's Commands, I execute his Orders punctually, I ſerve him with Diligence and Alacrity, and I find myſelf in a very happy Situation, with theſe my ſervile Maxims.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe Slaves, who becauſe of their good Behaviour have nothing to fear, and yet are naturally timid, thoſe Slaves, I ſay, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally moſt uſeful to their Maſters; on the contrary, thoſe who are bold, determined, and arrogant, are the greateſt Tremblers in the World, when by their Faults they have drawn the Indignation of their Maſters upon them.</p>
                           <p>Thanks to the Gods, I have no Reaſon to be afraid, my Maſter will in a little Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me for my faithful Service; in the mean Time this is my governing Principle, to do always what is moſt for the Eaſe of my Back.</p>
                           <p>After having ſecured my Maſter's Servants and Baggage in the Inn, as he commanded me, I came back to wait his Orders, 'tis fit I knock at the Door, that he might be informed that I am here. Oh! that I may be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to ſee him come out ſafe and ſound from this damn'd Houſe; but I fear I am come too late, and that it will be after Death the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>

to all the Furies in Hell, that he is my Slave, and therefore I muſt give him Freedom; the Madman has promiſed me a Purſe full of Money, if he keeps his Word I ſhall very chearfully take Leave of him, I will throw the Reins over his Neck, and ſuffer him to go where he pleaſes; for to be plain, I ſhall be afraid that when he is reſtor'd to his Senſes he will remember the Money he has given me, and demand it back again, perhaps with Intereſt too: My Father-in-law and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician treat me like a Madman; from whence can it proceed? I am wrapt in Wonder at it. —Let me conſider; am I awake, or is all this a Viſion?—No, 'tis but too certain; what then ſhall I do? after ſo many Storms I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I cannot do better than to go to this Courtezan, and by Prayers and Flatteries pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon her to give me back the Robe; if I ſhould have the Good-luck to ſucceed with this Woman, who like all the reſt of her Trade is true to her own Intereſt, I will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it home immediately, and do not doubt but with ſuch a Paſſport I ſhall gain Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and reſtore Peace again to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SHAKESPEAR</hi>'s <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi> has been generally allowed to be founded on the <hi>Menaechmi</hi> of <hi>Plautus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langbain,</hi> in his Account of the Dramatic Poets, ſays that if it be not a juſt Tranſlation of it, it is at leaſt a Paraphraſe, and in his Opinion far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a Tranſlation, called <hi>Manaechmus,</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>London,</hi> 1593.</p>
               <p>From this Tranſlation of <hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naechmi, Shakeſpear</hi> certainly borrowed his <hi>Comedy of Errors;</hi> but not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Copy of it, and being wholly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, I have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monſieur <hi>Gueudiville</hi>'s <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation of the <hi>Menaechmi</hi> into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as I am informed, it be not very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral as to the Dialogue, yet the Plot, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and Characters, being exactly the ſame with the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet's, it will ſerve to ſhew how much of the Plot <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has borrowed in his <hi>Comedy of Errors.</hi>

               <p>The Cities of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> and <hi>Epheſus</hi> being at War with each other, a Law was made in both, by which it was provided, that if any <hi>Epheſian</hi> Merchant was ſeen to traffic in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> or any <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Merchant in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> his Goods ſhould be confiſcated, and himſelf condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Death.</p>

               <p>The Story, though borrowed from <hi>Plautus,</hi> is yet very different; the Circumſtance of two Brothers being ſo extremely like each other, that it was impoſſible to diſtinguiſh them, is highly improbable in the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> however doubles the Miracle, and preſents us with two Pair of Twins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of one, with the ſame wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plautus</hi> accounts very naturally for the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers having both the ſame Name; the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father upon the Loſs of the eldeſt, whom he loved beſt, to preſerve the Remembrance of him, gives his Name to the youngeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> without aſſigning any Reaſon for it, makes the Twin Sons of <hi>Aegeon</hi> be both called <hi>Anthipholis,</hi> and the Twin Brothers, their Slaves, both <hi>Dromio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Separation of the Huſband and Wife, and their Children, from whence all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Miſtakes in the <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi> ariſe, is brought about without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Probability.</p>

               <p>When the Storm ariſes the Merchant and his Wife, who, as it ſhou'd ſeem, have a View to the diverting Perplexities which are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, faſten one <hi>Antipholis,</hi> and one <hi>Dromio</hi> together, ſo when the Ship ſplits they are very conveniently ſeparated. Had they, like other fond Parents, been more ſollicitous for the Preſervation of their own Offspring than their little Slaves, and uſed their joint Endeavours for that Purpoſe only, the Father and Mother, and their Twin Sons, might have been all taken up together by the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Veſſel, but thus equally dividing their Affection between their Children and their Slaves, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Contrivance of faſtening a Twin of each Sort together, occaſioned their falling into different Hands, and gave to each <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholis</hi> his <hi>Dromio,</hi> for the future Buſineſs of the Play.</p>
               <p>The Mother and the elder <hi>Antipholis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated, he and his little Slave <hi>Dromio</hi>

are carried to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where in Proceſs of Time he is married to a rich Lady, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles there: Here the younger <hi>Antipholis</hi> comes to ſeek for his Brother, and his Father after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for him; the old Man is immediately ſeized, and condemned to die, as has been mentioned, but the Duke reſpites him for the Space of one Day, in order to try if he can raiſe the Sum of one Thouſand Marks to buy his Life.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Scene <hi>Antipholis</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> makes his Appearance with the Merchant of the City, who informing him of what had happened to the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Merchant, adviſes him to give out that he came from <hi>Epidam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Antipholis,</hi> deceived by the Reſemblance, ſuppoſes this <hi>Dromio</hi> to be his Slave, reproves him for his ill timed Jeſts, and aſks him where he had left his Money? <hi>Dromio</hi> talks of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence he had given him two or three Days ago.</p>

                  <hi>Antipholis</hi> aſks for his Thouſand Marks? <hi>Dromio</hi> tells him of his Dinner, his Houſe, his Wife, and preſſes him to come home. <hi>Antipholis</hi> at laſt, in a Fury, ſtrikes him, <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio</hi> runs off, and <hi>Antipholis,</hi> full of Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about his Money, returns to his Inn to look after it.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Act the Scene is the Houſe of <hi>Antipholis</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> his Wife complains to her Siſter of her Huſband's long Stay, and wonders the Slave ſhe ſent for him is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. <hi>Dromio</hi> then enters, and humorouſly repeats what had paſt between his ſuppoſed Maſter and him, declaring that he believes him to be mad, the Wife frets, and orders him to go back again and fetch him.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Scene changes again to the Street,</l>

The Jeweller, the Merchant, the Courtezan, his Wife, and her Siſter, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been all deceived by the Reſemblance of the two <hi>Antipholis</hi>'s, charge the one they are ſpeaking to with all that had paſſed between them and the other; his occaſions a great deal of Confuſion and Perplexity. Old <hi>Aegeon,</hi> on ſeeing <hi>Antipholis</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and taking him for his Son <hi>Antipholis,</hi> whom he had parted from ſeven Years before in the Port of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> tells the Duke that he has now found a Friend who will pay his Fine, and ſave his Life, and accordingly goes up to him, and naming him, aſks him if he does not know his Father.</p>

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0451201402:236"/>
                  <hi>Antipholis</hi> proteſts he never ſaw him before; the old Man reminds him that it is ſeven Years ſince they parted at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and deplores his own Miſery in having been ſo ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by his own Son. <hi>Antipholis</hi> tells him he never ſaw his Father in his Life, nor was ever in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> which the Duke confirmed.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of this new Perplexity the Abbeſs enters with <hi>Antipholis</hi> and <hi>Dromio</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> all ſtand amazed at the exact Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the two Gentlemen, and their Slaves; the Abbeſs ſpying <hi>Aegeon,</hi> owns herſelf to be <hi>Emilia,</hi> his Wife, the Mother of thoſe two <hi>Antipholis</hi>'s and informs him that ſhe and the elder <hi>Antipholis,</hi> with the Twin <hi>Dromio,</hi> were taken out of the Sea by Men of <hi>Epidamnum,</hi> but that ſome Fiſhermen of <hi>Corinth</hi> took away her Son and <hi>Dromio,</hi> and left her with the <hi>Epidamniens,</hi> that what became of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe never knew, but that herſelf ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the Fortune of being Abbeſs of that Priory.</p>
               <p>The two <hi>Antipholis</hi>'s being now diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the Miſtakes which aroſe from their Reſemblance are cleared up, <hi>Aegeon</hi> has his Life given him by the Duke, and they all go into the Priory to diſcourſe more at large up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſeveral Fortunes.</p>
               <p>The Unity of Time is exactly obſerved in the <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi>; the Incidents of this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0451201402:237"/>
Play take up the Space of one Day like thoſe of the <hi>Menaechmi;</hi> but the Action which in the laſt is ſingle, and the moſt ſimple that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be, is by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> multiplied into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, ſome of which are far from being either probable or neceſſary. He has taken all the Characters in the <hi>Menaechmi,</hi> except <hi>Peniculus</hi> the Paraſite, and the old Man, Father-in-law to <hi>Menaechmus</hi> of <hi>Epidamnum,</hi> and has added ſeveral others; every one of the Incidents he has likewiſe made Uſe of, but varied and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Circumſtances ſo freely, that his Play ſeems to be rather an Imitation, than, as <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bain</hi> calls it, a Tranſlation or Paraphraſe of the <hi>Menaechmi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Addition of the two <hi>Dromio</hi>'s increaſes the Buſineſs of the Play, but renders the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſtill more improbable, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſo in the <hi>Menaechmi,</hi> where but half the Degree of Credulity is neceſſary to make it be reliſhed.</p>
               <p>The Miſtakes which ariſe from the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Twins, are conducted with much leſs Art by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> than <hi>Plautus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet all appears the Effects of Chance, in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> of Deſign; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his Drama are hardly ever introduced with Propriety; they appear on the Stage, and go off again, evidently for no other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to give Occaſion for the Blunders which enſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0451201402:238"/>Thus <hi>Antipholis</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> being reſolved to leave <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſends <hi>Dromio</hi> to the Port to ſee if any Veſſel is ready to ſail, and bids him come to him to the Mart, where he will wait his Return, accordingly they ſeparate, and it may now be reaſonably ſuppoſed that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholis</hi> is gone thither, but inſtead of that we find him a Scene or two afterwards ſtanding in the ſame Place, where he is met either by the Wife, the Friends, or the Servants of the other <hi>Antipholis;</hi> and after having with great Difficulty diſengaged himſelf from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of perplexing Adventures, again he declares he is going to the Mart, and goes off for that Purpoſe, and again he is found in the ſame Place to give Riſe to new ones.</p>
               <p>In this Manner the whole Buſineſs of the <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi> is conducted. Thoſe Errors do not as in the Play, which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from, ariſe out of a natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Succeſſion of Incidents, but every Thing is put out of its Courſe to introduce them, and each Error is produced by an Abſurdity.</p>

               <p>The Encounter of theſe Heroes, with the extraordinary Manner of their Meeting each other alone in the Receſſes of a Wood, with other Circumſtances as improbable as any in Romance, are related in the true Stile of ſuch Writings, by <hi>Saxo-Grammaticus,</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Hiſtory.</p>

                  <hi>Fengo,</hi> fired with Envy at his Brother's Happineſs, is reſolved, by Treachery, to ruin him. So that Virtue is not always ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Deſigns of ſuch as are the neareſt to, and the moſt intimate with us. For when an Opportunity offered to commit Fratricide, he with bloody Hand ſatiates the dire Luſt of his Heart, poiſoned with Envy; and enjoying the Wife of his murdered Brother, adds foul Inceſt to his Fratricide. He who ſubmits to one Offence too readily offends again, for one Crime is often the Provocation to another.</p>
               <p>He contrived this Villany with ſuch Art and Impudence as to frame an Excuſe for his Guilt from counterfeit Benevolence, and give to Fratricide the Colour of Love. <hi>Geruth</hi> was of ſo mild a Diſpoſition as never to give the leaſt Offence, and yet he ſaid ſhe had incurred the ſevereſt Hatred of her Huſband, and that he had killed his Brother for her ſake, and to ſave her, thinking it ungenerous ſo gentle a Lady, and without Gall, ſhould endure the extream Moroſeneſs of that Man.</p>
               <p>His Succeſs was equal to his Wiſhes, for Princes may be deceived, and made to believe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0451201402:241"/>
Untruths in Courts where Buffoonery is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times favoured, and malicious Detraction ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. <hi>Fengo</hi> heſitated not with murderous Hands to embrace a Brother's Wife, and with equal Villany commits a double Impiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amleth</hi> ſees this, but that he might not raiſe Suſpicions in his Uncle by an over prudent Care for his own Safety, puts on the Guiſe of Folly, and feigns himſelf diſtracted, and by this Sort of Device he not only covers his Deſign, but ſaves himſelf. He lazily ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf out every Day before his Mother's Hearth, rolling on the Ground, and covering himſelf with Filth; his Face diſcoloured and beſmeared with Gore and Naſtineſs, preſented the ridiculous Extravagance of a Natural. Whatever he ſaid was like the Ravings of a Madman; whatever Action he performed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of extream Ignorance. In ſhort, you would not ſay he was a Man, but a ridiculous Monſter, produced by Fortune in a Frenzy.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſitting by the Fire, and raking the Embers with his Hand, he would make wooden Hooks, and harden them in the Fire, and faſten the Ends within one another, that they might hold more firmly together; and when aſked what he was about, would ſay he made ſharp Spikes to revenge his Father.</p>
               <p>He was not a little laughed at for this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The Vanity of ſuch a ridiculous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance was treated with Contempt by all,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0451201402:242"/>
though it afterwards was of Uſe to him in the Proſecution of his Deſign.</p>
               <p>This Ingenuity gave to thoſe of better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the firſt Suſpicion of his Subtilty. The latent Ability of the Workman for greater Matters was ſeen by his Skill in leſſer ones. Nor could it be thought that his Senſes were impaired, who by the Work of his Hands diſcovered ſuch ingenious Artifice. Beſides, he preſerved his Heap of Brands that he had burnt at the Points to make them hard with the greateſt Care.</p>
               <p>There were thoſe, who aſſerting that he was of uncommon Strength and Quickneſs of Parts, that he hid his good Senſe under the Pretence of Folly, and covered the deep De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his Mind with crafty Invention, and that his Advice could not be more readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered than by introducing to him at any Time in his Receſſes a beautiful Woman, who might call forth his Mind to the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Love.</p>
               <p>So prone is Nature to the Paſſion of Love, that no Artifice can diſguiſe it, and it is too violent to be interrupted by Policy. And therefore, if his Ignorance were counterfeit he would, when Occaſion offered, yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Power of Love.</p>
               <p>Certain Companions therefore are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who ſhould engage him to ride to diſtant
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0451201402:243"/>
Parts of the Foreſt, and try him with that Temptation.</p>
               <p>Amongſt them there happened to be a Youth, who had the ſame Nurſe with <hi>Amleth,</hi> and ſtill preſerved in his Heart the Regard that naturally ariſes in thoſe who are brought up together.</p>
               <p>He preferring the Remembrance of former Fellowſhip to the preſent Charge, attends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Amleth,</hi> with the reſt of his appointed Comrades, with a Purpoſe to inform rather than betray him; which he could not doubt would happen at laſt if he diſcovered the leaſt Sign of a ſound Mind, and eſpecially if he ſhould openly indulge the Paſſion of Love.</p>
               <p>Which was no Secret to <hi>Amleth</hi> himſelf; for when commanded to get on Horſeback he purpoſely ſeats himſelf ſo as to turn his Back to the Horſe's Head, and face his Tail, to which he began to apply the Bridle, as if he was by that Part to govern the Speed of his Horſe. By means of this Contrivance he baffles the Deſign of his Uncle, and defeats his Arts. It was very ridiculous to ſee the Horſe go forward without the uſual Check of the Reins, the Rider directing only the Tail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amleth</hi> in the Way met with a Wolf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Trees; his Companions ſaying they had met with a young Horſe, he replied there were few ſuch in <hi>Fengo</hi>'s Troops; by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0451201402:244"/>
this modeſt and witty Prevarication he rallied the Riches of his Uncle.</p>
               <p>When they added that he had made a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anſwer; he affirmed that he intended that he might ſo to do, not in any Degree ſeem to favour a Falſhood. For deſiring to be thought incapable of lying, he blended Craft and Truth together that he might not ſeem entirely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from Veracity in whatever he ſaid, nor diſcover the Richneſs of his Parts by too much Exactneſs.</p>
               <p>Paſſing along the Shore, when his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions found the Rudder of a ſhip-wrecked Veſſel, they ſaid they had found a Knife of prodigious Size: It is therefore fit, ſays he, to cut up a large Ham, meaning the Sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to which the Size of the Rudder did well agree. Paſſing alſo by the ſandy Clifts, and being directed to look upon the Beach, as if it were Corn, he ſaid the ſame was ground by the foaming Billows of the Sea. This Anſwer being commended by his Attendant, be aſſured them it was diſcreetly ſaid by him.</p>
               <p>Being left by them on Purpoſe, that he might with greater Freedom indulge his Luſt, in a private Place he meets a Girl, ſent by his Uncle, as if it were by Chance, and would have lain with her, had not the Foſter-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warned him of the Snare by a ſecret kind of Information.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0451201402:245"/>For he, conſidering how he might beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Office of an unknown Monitor to his Friend, and prevent the Danger of his wanton Appetite, fixed a Straw he found on the Ground in the Tail of a Buzze, or Bee, flying by, and drove him towards the Place where he knew <hi>Amleth</hi> was. By this Act he conferred the greateſt Benefit on the unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Youth.</p>
               <p>Nor was this Notice more cunningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed than readily underſtood; for <hi>Amleth</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fly, and the Straw that he carried in his Tail, and having carefully conſidered it to be a tacit Admonition to beware of Frauds: Alarmed therefore with the Suſpicion of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deſigns againſt him, that he might more ſecurely indulge his Wiſhes, he catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Girl in his Arms, carries her a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Diſtance into a Marſh, and unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and after Enjoyment earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats her not to declare it to any one.</p>
               <p>With equal Concern therefore is Silence urged and obtained. For their being brought up together under the ſame Guardians from their Infancy, produced the greateſt Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity between her and <hi>Amleth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon his Return home, being aſked by every one whether he had gratified his Luſt, he owned he had lain with the Girl. Being aſked again in what Place he had done it, or what Pillow he had uſed, anſwered, The Hoof

of an Animal that carries a Burthen, <note n="§" place="bottom">Oeſtrus or Oeſtrum has a double Signification, either a Gad-bee as above, or a Coxcomb, as in this Place.</note> the Comb of a Cock, and under an arched Roof. He had put all theſe Particulars, when under Trial, that he might avoid the telling a Lie. This Account excited much Laughter in thoſe about him, although, for the Jeſt ſake, he did not diminiſh any Thing of the Truth.</p>
               <p>The Girl alſo being queſtioned (kept her Word with him) and declared he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Credit is given her, and the rather, as it appeared that his Guards knew nothing of the matter. Then he who had marked the Buzze for a Token, to ſhew that the Safety of <hi>Amleth</hi> was owing to his Conceit, ſaid that he was lately the only one who took Care of him, and that the young Man's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was to the Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Nor was the Merit of the Token forgot: he related how he ſaw the little Carrier of the Straw with haſty Flight paſſing near him, and that the Straw was ſtuck in the hinder Parts of his Body. As this Relation excited greater Laughter in the reſt, the Friend of <hi>Amleth</hi> was no leſs delighted with his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>All of them being defeated, and unable to gain Admittance into the Secrets of this young Man's Stratagems; one of the Friends of <hi>Fengo,</hi> more preſumptuous than politic, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0451201402:247"/>
that this unextricable Scheme of Subtilty could be unravelled by common Artifice; for he was too obſtinate to be moved by Trials of little Moment: An ordinary manner of Trial would not reach ſuch Variety of Craft. But he had diſcovered by ſuperior Sagacity a more ſubtle Manner of trying him, not improper for Execution, but moſt effectual for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Thing propoſed.</p>
               <p>The Scheme was this, "That <hi>Fengo</hi> ſhould under the Pretence of Buſineſs of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence withdraw himſelf, and <hi>Amleth</hi> be ſhut up with his Mother alone in her Apartment, Care being taken to have a Man, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to either of them, ſhould be placed in ſome ſecret Part of the Room unſeen, to hear attentively whatever paſſed in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them. For if the Son was really in his Senſes he would have no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſpeaking freely to a Mother's Ear, nor miſtruſt the Fidelity of her that bore him. And that he might not ſeem more forward to adviſe than ready to execute, he deſired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Spy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fengo</hi> approved the Scheme, and ſets out with the Pretence of taking a long Journey.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Projector having privately ſtole to the Chamber where <hi>Amleth</hi> and his Mother were, lay hid under the Matt of the Bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0451201402:248"/>But <hi>Amleth</hi> was not the Dupe of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. For ſuſpecting that he might be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard by ſome officious Liſtener, he has at firſt Recourſe to his accuſtomed Folly, and imitates the crowing of a Cock, and flapping his Arms as if they were Wings, he jumps up and down upon the Bed to try if any Thing lay hid there. And when he found a Maſs under his Feet he examined the Place with his Sword, and ſtabs the Man who was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and dragging him forth put him to Death. Cutting the Body in Pieces, he boils them, and pours them out through the Sewer to be devoured by the Hogs.</p>
               <p>And thus was the miſerable Body rendered undiſtinguiſhable from the Dung of the Stye.</p>
               <p>Having eſcaped this Snare, he returns to his Mother's Apartment, and when ſhe with great Lamentation and Tears began to bemoan the want of Underſtanding in her Son now preſent, "Why; O! worſt of Women, ſays he, doſt thou endeavour to diſguiſe the fouleſt Crime under a falſe Species of Wailing? Thou, who ſporting with the Wantonneſs of a Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and yielding to the vile and impious Condition of your ſecond Marriage, embrace in your inceſtuous Boſom the Murderer of your Huſband, and fawn upon, and pleaſe with lewdeſt Tranſport the very Man who put to death the Father of your Offspring; ſo Mares are coupled with Horſes that ſubdued their Foremates. It is for Beaſts alone to be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0451201402:249"/>
dragged to any, and to every Male. By this Example it appears that you have loſt all Memory of your former Huſband. It is not without Reaſon that I bear the Reſemblance of a Fool; for I cannot doubt that he who could deſtroy a Brother would with like Cruelty rage againſt his other Kindred. It is ſafer to wear the Garb of Folly than of Senſe, and I muſt borrow a Safeguard from the loweſt Species of Madneſs. Yet the Care of revenging my Father is ever preſent to my Mind, but I wait for Times and Seaſons. The ſame Place ſuits not with every Scene or Purpoſe againſt a dark and cruel Mind, much Thought is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. But for you to lament my Madneſs is vain, when you ought rather to deplore your own Infamy; you ſhould therefore not lament another's but your own Failing, for the reſt be on your Guard and keep the ſtricteſt Silence. By ſuch Reproach did he endeavour to recall his Heart-rent Mother to the Practice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Habits of Virtue, and to teach her to prefer the former Flames of chaſter Love to the preſent criminal Tranſports."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fengo</hi> returns, and of every one, and every where enquires for his injudicious Spy; but he is no more to be found, nor does any one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen him. <hi>Amleth,</hi> in jeſt, is aſked whether he could diſcover any Tracts of him; and replies, "that he went in at the Sewer, fell to the Boſtom, was kept down by the Mud, and devoured by the Hogs, who thronged to the Draught." Which Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0451201402:250"/>
though true, ſeeming idle and fooliſh, was treated as ridiculous.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Fengo</hi> no longer doubted of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of his Son-in-law, he reſolved to deſtroy him, but was afraid to execute his Purpoſe on account of his Grandfather, <hi>Roderic,</hi> and the Diſpleaſure of his own Wife. To cover his Guilt by the Service of another, he purpoſes to have him deſtroyed by means of the King of <hi>Britain.</hi> Thus deſirous of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his Cruelty, he chuſes rather to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute his Friend than to be thought infamous himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amleth,</hi> departing in ſecret, directs his Mother to furniſh the Hall with Hangings well knotted together, and at the Expiration of a Year to report him dead, and celebrate his funeral Obſequies, and at that very time he promiſes to return.</p>
               <p>He is attended by two of <hi>Fengo</hi>'s Officers, bearing Letters inſcribed on Wood (for that was once a famous Manner of Writing) by which it was given in Charge to the King of <hi>Britain</hi> to deſtroy the young Man that was ſent to him.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe Officers ſlept, <hi>Amleth</hi> examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Baggage diſcovers theſe Tablets; having read them, he rubs out what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten therein, and inſerting other Characters, changes the Tenor of the Mandate from his own Deſtruction to the Death of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0451201402:251"/>
Nor ſatisfied with this Alteration, whereby he ſaves his own Life and expoſes that of his Guards, he adds, as the earneſt Entreaty of <hi>Fengo,</hi> that the King of <hi>Britain</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his Daughter in Marriage upon that Youth he had ſent him, who was moſt wiſe and prudent.</p>
               <p>When they came to <hi>Britain</hi> the Envoys waited on the King, and preſented the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for their own Deſtruction, though they thought it threatned not them but their Companion.</p>
               <p>The King, taking no Notice to them of the Inſtructions delivered him, entertains them with great Magnificence and Hoſpitality, when <hi>Amleth,</hi> deſpiſing the Splendor of the royal Tables as if they contained but common Food, abſtains in a ſurpriſing Manner from the richeſt Exhibition of Dainties, both in Meats and Drinks.</p>
               <p>All admired that a Youth of foreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſhould nauſeate the choiceſt Dainties of the royal Board and moſt excellent Luxury, as if it were coarſe and homely Fare.</p>
               <p>The Banquet ended, the King diſmiſſed his Friends that they might retire to Reſt, but took Care, by one ſent privately and hid in their Apartments, to be informed of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of his Gueſts. When <hi>Amleth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked by his Comrades why he abſtained from the Entertainment of Yeſterday as from
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0451201402:252"/>
Poiſon? "replied that the Bread was ſprinkled with the Contagion of Blood, that the Wine taſted of the Sword, that the animal Food ſavoured of the Corpſe of a dead Man, and was as offenſive as the Smell of a Sepulchre."</p>
               <p>He added "that the King had mean Eyes, that the Queen in three Inſtances reſembled a Servant;" railing not only at the Feaſt but at the Authors of it.</p>
               <p>His Companions, upbraiding him with his former want of Underſtanding, began to abuſe him for having found Fault with approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good Things, blamed what was proper, and ſlandered with indecent Language a great King, and a Queen of refined Manners, and treated with Diſgrace and Indignity thoſe who really deſerved Applauſe.</p>
               <p>Which Circumſtances being related to the King by his Officer, he declared the Wiſdom or Madneſs of him who had related ſuch Things of more than mortal Growth in ſo few Words to ſhew ſuch Extent of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. He ſent for the Steward, and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him where he had the Bread, and when he was told that it was made by the Baker to the Houſhold, he aſked again where the Corn grew, and if there was any Sign of human Slaughter in that Place?</p>
               <p>He anſwered "that there was a Field not far off covered with the Bones of Men long ſince ſlain, yet manifeſtly exhibiting the Remains
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0451201402:253"/>
of ancient Slaughter, which he, with Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of greater Plenty, as the richer Soil had ſown with Spring Corn, and therefore he did not know whether the Bread might not have contracted a diſagreeable Taſte."</p>
               <p>When the King heard this, believing <hi>Amleth</hi> had ſpoken Truth, he took Care to know whence the Bacon came.</p>
               <p>The Man owned that the Swine, ſtraying from his Care, had fed upon the Carcaſe of a Thief, and ſo perhaps the Meat might taſte ſomething like Corruption.</p>
               <p>When the King found that his Opinion was true, demanded in this Inſtaece likewiſe with what Liquor he had mixed the Drink? as he knew it to be made of Corn and Water; the Situation of the Spring being ſhewn him he ſet about digging, and found many Swords eaten with Ruſt, from whence he ſuppoſed the Water had contracted that Smell.</p>
               <p>Others ſaid the Drink was found fault with becauſe in the Draught he had met with Bees that had been bred in the Belly of a dead Man, and taſted of Comb. By which the King, ſeeing there was ſufficient Reaſon to complain of the Taſte of theſe Things, finding that he himſelf was reproached on account of his Eyes, and knowing that this muſt allude to Baſeneſs of Birth, taking his Mother aſide, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her who was his Father, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring ſhe knew no other than the King, by
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0451201402:254"/>
threatning her with Death unleſs ſhe confeſſed; he diſcovered himſelf to be the Son of a Servant.</p>
               <p>Thus by the extorted Confeſſion he came to underſtand that his Origin, which had been reflected on, was at leaſt ambiguous. He is confounded with Shame at this Diſcovery of his Condition, but no leſs charmed with the young Man's Wiſdom; and aſked him why he had reproachfully ſlurred the Queen as one of ſervile Manners? But whilſt he laments that the gentle Diſpoſition of his Wife was attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Diſcourſe of his Gueſt in the Night, he learns that her Mother was a waiting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and whereas he ſaid ſhe exhibited three Defects of a ſervile Nature, they are theſe. One, "that ſhe dreſſed her Head in the ſame Manner as Servants do, another, that ſhe tucked up her Gown in walking, the third was, that ſhe picked her Teeth with a Skewer, and eat the Pickings of them. He took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that her Mother was reduced to Servitude by becoming a Captive, ſo that ſhe was not leſs ſervile in her Birth than her Manners."</p>
               <p>Such Sagacity being reverenced by the King, as if it were divine, he gave him his Daughter in Marriage, and received his Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of any Thing as if it bore the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Heaven. But as for his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he might perform the Beheſt of his Friends, he hanged them up the next Day, which, though an Advantage, <hi>Amleth</hi> ſeemed to reſent as an Injury, feigning a Diſtreſs of Mind, and received Money by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0451201402:255"/>
from the King; which he afterwards took Care ſecretly to melt down and pour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hollow Staves.</p>
               <p>Having ſtay'd with him a Year, he obtains Leave to depart, and returns home again, taking nothing out of the Magazine of royal Treaſure but the hollow Staves, in which he had poured the Gold. When he arrived at <hi>Jutland,</hi> he reſumed his old Behaviour, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his late Elegance for the ridiculous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he had before employed. And when he entered the Hall, covered with Naſtineſs, where the Funeral Rites were celebrated, he threw every body into great Amazement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a falſe Report had been ſpread of his Death. At length their Aſtoniſhment was turned into Laughter, and the Gueſts rallied each other upon the Preſence of him alive, to whom they had performed Honours as dead.</p>
               <p>When queſtioned concerning his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſaid, ſhewing the Staves he held, "Here is both the one and the other;" which was ſaid with equal Wit and Truth, for though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared an unmeaning Speech to moſt who heard it, yet ſwerved not from his cuſtomary regard to Truth, ſhewing the Compenſation inſtead of the Men that were executed.</p>
               <p>Then mixing with the Waiters, that he might heighten the Mirth of the Table, he ſupplied them with Liquor with more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Diligence, and that his flowing Habit might not obſtruct his moving up and down,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0451201402:256"/>
he girt it round him with his Belt, and often with Deſign, drawing his Sword, he cut his Fingers with the Point; Care therefore was taken by thoſe about him to faſten his Sword in the Scabbard with a Nail.</p>
               <p>That he might the more ſecurely effect his Purpoſe he charged the Nobility with Exceſs of Liquor, till all were overcame with Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, unable to walk, were obliged to take up their Reſt in the Hall, and ſleep where they had been feaſting. And when he obſerved them in a Condition fit for his Deſigns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Execution of it was in his Power, he puts the Brands he had formerly prepared into his Boſom, and then re-entering the Hall where the Nobles lay ſtretched on the Ground, oppreſſed with Sleep and Surfeit, he let fall the Curtain his Mother had wove, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lines that held it round the ſides of the Room, which he drew over them, and faſtened with the Hooks in ſo artful a Manner, that not one of them, though he ſtrove with never ſo much Strength, could poſſibly get up.</p>
               <p>After this he ſets fire to the Room, which ſpreading far and wide, ſoon ſet the whole Houſe in a Blaze, deſtroyed the Palace, and burnt all, both thoſe that continued aſleep, and thoſe who laboured to riſe but in vain. Thence haſting to <hi>Fengo</hi>'s Apartment, who had been before conducted thither by his Attendants, he took his Sword that hung
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0451201402:257"/>
by his Bed, and put his own in its room; then rouſing his Uncle, he told him that his Nobles were deſtroyed by Fire, that <hi>Amleth</hi> was there, and furniſhed with the Hooks he had formerly made, and was now preſent with him eager to inflict the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance due for his Father's Death.</p>
               <p>On hearing this, <hi>Fengo</hi> jumps from his Bed, and was murdered, while diſappointed of his own he vainly endeavours to draw <hi>Amleth</hi>'s Sword. O! brave Man! and worthy everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Renown, who, furniſhing himſelf wiſely with counterfeit Folly, covered more than human Wiſdom under the Guiſe of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, not only ſecured his own Safety by that Artifice, but obtained the Means of compleatly revenging his Father, and having ſo done, it is left for every one to judge which was greater, his Bravery or Wiſdom.</p>

                  <hi>CLAUDIUS,</hi> the reigning King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> having ſecretly murdered his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to poſſeſs himſelf of his Throne afterwards, married his Widow; the Ghoſt of the deceaſed King appears to ſome Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, who were poſted on the Platform before the Palace; theſe Soldiers tell <hi>Marcellus,</hi> their Officer, what they had ſeen, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting <hi>Horatio,</hi> the Friend of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> Son to the deceaſed King, with it; theſe two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen watch one Night on the Platform, with an Intention to ſpeak to the Apparition if it ſhould appear. The Ghoſt at the accuſtomed Hour appears. <hi>Horatio</hi> ſolemnly conjures it to ſpeak, and unfold the Cauſe of its Appearance, but the Ghoſt continues ſilent and ſtalks away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horatio</hi> thereupon reſolves to tell <hi>Hamlet</hi> what had happened; the Prince, full of Grief
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0451201402:260"/>
for his Father's Death, diſpleaſed at his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's inceſtuous Marriage, and diſcontented with the Behaviour of his Uncle, immediately concludes from this Account of his Father's Spirit appearing that all was not well, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to his two Friends that he will watch with them that Night on the Platform, and ſpeak to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Accordingly at Midnight he meets them at the appointed Place, and the Ghoſt ſoon after appearing, <hi>Hamlet</hi> in a moſt earneſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Manner conjures it to ſpeak, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the Cauſe of its appearing. The Ghoſt beckens him to follow it; his Companions, apprehending ſome Danger might happen to his Perſon, endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him, hut in vain, <hi>Hamlet</hi> breaks from them and follows the Ghoſt, who bringing him to a remote Place declares that he is the Spirit of his Father, that he was poiſoned in his Garden by his Brother, who luſted for his Wife and Crown; he then charges him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his Murder, and vaniſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamlet</hi> vows to fulfil his Commands, and to conceal the Grief and Indignation which prey upon his Heart, and his vowed Purpoſe of Revenge, counterfeits Madneſs; which alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the guilty King, and troubling his Mother, they ſend for two of his School-fellows to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe him, and engage him in Diverſions to abate the Force of his Melancholy.</p>

                  <hi>Polonius,</hi> an old Lord, very faithful to the King's Intereſts, and whoſe Daughter, <hi>Ophelia, Hamlet</hi> is in Love with; from her Report of a frantic Viſit he made her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes he is mad for her; ſhe having, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Orders, returned his Letters and Preſents, and refuſed to hear his Profeſſions as uſual. <hi>Pollonius,</hi> having as he thought diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Cauſe of <hi>Hamlet</hi>'s Madneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the King and Queen with his Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Ophelia</hi> is deſignedly thrown in his way, while the King and <hi>Polonius</hi> conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves to hear their Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamlet,</hi> after uttering a great many ſenſible Extravagancies, leaves <hi>Ophelia</hi> firmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Madneſs, which ſhe affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately deplores; but the King, who had heard all his Diſcourſe, being perſuaded that Love was not the Cauſe of his Melancholy, and that there might be Danger in it, reſolves to ſend him to <hi>England</hi> to demand the Tribute, the Payment of the Tribute which had been long neglected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polonius,</hi> to whom he communicates this Scheme, approves of it, but adviſes that the Queen ſhould firſt ſend for him, and in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Converſation intreat him to diſcover the Cauſe of his Uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>The King conſents, mean Time <hi>Hamlet</hi> having engaged ſome Players to repreſent a Piece ſomething like the Murder of his Father,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0451201402:262"/>
invites the King and Queen to the Play; and he doubting that the Spirit that appeared to him might be a lying Spirit, reſoves to make the Play the Teſt of the King's Conſcience; he therefore deſires his Friend, <hi>Horatio,</hi> to join with him in carefully obſerving the King's Countenance during the Repreſentation of one particular Scene, which reſembles the Circumſtance of his Father's Death, adding,
<q>
                     <l>——If his occult Guilt</l>
                     <l>Do not itſelf unkennel in one Speech,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly the King is ſo much ſtruck with that Scene that he riſes abruptly and goes out, by which <hi>Hamlet</hi> is convinced that the Ghoſt had told him nothing but Truth. The Queen then ſends for <hi>Hamlet</hi> with an Intention to queſtion him concerning his late Behaviour, and <hi>Polonius,</hi> with her Conſent, conceals himſelf behind the Arras to hear their Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The Queen being frighted at her Son's rude Treatment of her, cries out for Help, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> behind the Arras echoes her, and <hi>Hamlet,</hi> ſuppoſing it was the King who had concealed himſelf there, kills him.</p>
               <p>After a ſevere Lecture to his Mother, he charges her not to diſcover that his Madneſs is feigned, declares that he ſuſpects ſome Treaſon in the Embaſſy he is ſent on to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0451201402:263"/>
yet reſolves to go, and madly takes Leave of the King and her for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ophelia,</hi> at the News of her Father's being murdered by <hi>Hamlet,</hi> grows diſtracted; her Brother, <hi>Laertes,</hi> fired by Rage and Grief, raiſes a Mutiny to revenge his Father. The King declares that he is innocent of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Death, informs him of the Manner of it, and joins with him in conſpiring the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Hamlet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamlet,</hi> ſuſpecting the Letters his two Schoolfellows carried to <hi>England</hi> contained ſome dangerous Inſtructions concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſteals them, and upon examining them finds therein an earneſt Requeſt from his Uncle to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to put him to Death on his Arrival at his Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamlet</hi> ſuppreſſes this Letter, and writes another in the Name of his Uncle to the ſame King, in which he deſires him to put the Bearers of that Letter to Death; this Packet he lays in the Place from whence he had taken the other.</p>
               <p>The next Day they are attacked by a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they fight, and <hi>Hamlet</hi> boarding it alone, is taken Priſoner, and his two Companions continue their Voyage to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamlet</hi> prevails upon the Pirates to land him in <hi>Denmark</hi>; the King hearing of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, urges <hi>Laertes,</hi> who breathes nothing but

Revenge againſt him, to kill him treacherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are fencing with Foils, to which he will engage him, by pretending to lay a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on his ſuperior Skill at that Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laertes</hi> conſents, and adds that he will anoint the Point of his Sword with a ſtrong Poiſon, that if he draws Blood he may be ſure to kill him.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time the diſtracted <hi>Ophelia</hi> is accidentally drowned; the King, the Queen, and her Brother attend her Funeral: As ſoon as ſhe is laid in the Earth, <hi>Laertes,</hi> in a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport of Grief, leaps into her Grave. <hi>Hamlet,</hi> underſtanding that it is <hi>Ophelia</hi> whom they had buried, wildly aſſerting his Claim as a Lover to ſuperior Sorrow, leaps into the Grave like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, where <hi>Laertes,</hi> quite overcome with Rage and Grief, furiouſly faſtens on him; they are with Difficulty parted by the King's Command, and ſome time after the King, as if nothing had happened, ſends a Meſſage to <hi>Hamlet,</hi> requeſting him to fence with <hi>Laertes</hi> for a conſiderable Wager; <hi>Hamlet</hi> obeys, they meet in a Hall, the King and Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent.</p>
               <p>The King, to make ſure Work, after drinking <hi>Hamlet</hi>'s Health, poiſons the Wine, and offers the Cup to <hi>Hamlet</hi>; he refuſes it, and the Queen, not knowing that the Wine is poiſoned, drinks, though the King endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prevent her. <hi>Laertes</hi> wounds <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> with the poiſoned Rapier, in the Scuffle

they change Weapons, and <hi>Hamlet</hi> wounds <hi>Laertes,</hi> they both bleed; the Queen is ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Agonies of Death, ſhe tells her Son that the Wine is poiſoned, and expires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laertes,</hi> full of Remorſe for the Treachery he had been guilty of, confeſſes the whole Contrivance, and the Part the King had in it. <hi>Hamlet</hi> ſtabs the King with the poiſoned Sword that had wounded both him and <hi>Laertes,</hi> and upon the King's calling for Help obliges him to drink of the Wine he had poiſoned.</p>
               <p>The King dies, and <hi>Hamlet</hi> and <hi>Laertes</hi> exchanging Forgiveneſs with each other, both expire. <hi>Hamlet</hi> with his laſt Breath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Friend, <hi>Horatio,</hi> who would have killed himſelf, to live and do Juſtice to his Fame, by declaring his Story to the World.</p>
               <p>The Tranſlation of the Story of <hi>Amleth</hi> from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Saxo-Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> I was favoured with by a Friend; the Story itſelf is full of ridiculous Fancies, wild and improbable Circumſtances, and as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, has more the Appearance of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance than an Hiſtorical Fact.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> founded his <hi>Tragedy of Hamlet</hi> upon it is very plain, but is it uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether he ſaw a literal Tranſlation of it, or met with the Incidents dreſt up like a Novel, and perhaps with thoſe Alterations which he has adopted in his Play. All the principal Circumſtances are the ſame in the

Play as the Hiſtory. In both a Prince mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Brother, uſurps his Dignity, and marries his Widow: The Son of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Prince reſolves to revenge his Father; for that Purpoſe he feigns himſelf mad, and at laſt accompliſhes his Deſign; ſeveral of the leſſer Circumſtances are alſo as exactly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, and others have afforded Hints for new ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amleth</hi> has a private Interview with his Mother, and kills the Spy who had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to overhear their Converſation. <hi>Hamlet</hi> likewiſe viſits the Queen in her Apartment, and kills <hi>Polonius,</hi> who had concealed himſelf behind the Hangings.</p>
               <p>When the Spies are removed the Diſcourſe of the two Princes is much the ſame; they reproach their Mothers with their inceſtuous Marriage, ſharply reprove them for their Crimes declare their Madneſs to be feigned, and enjoin them to Secreſy.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſy to <hi>England</hi> is deſigned after the Hiſtory. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> indeed makes <hi>Hamlet,</hi> after two Days Abſence, be ſet on ſhore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at <hi>Denmark;</hi> and <hi>Amleth</hi> in the Hiſtory arrives in <hi>England,</hi> has his Companions hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and marries the King's Daughter before he comes back. But <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Plan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the immediate Return of <hi>Hamlet;</hi> however the Contrivance of changing the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are the ſame, and of puniſhing the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Bearers of them. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0451201402:267"/>
thoſe Bearers the Schoolfellows, and profeſt Friends of <hi>Hamlet;</hi> a Circumſtance which heightens their Baſeneſs, and juſtifies the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice he uſes to procure their Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The Deſign of entrapping <hi>Amleth</hi> by means of a Girl, has not been wholly neglected by <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> though he manages this Incident much more decently. <hi>Ophelia,</hi> with whom he is in Love, is ordered to throw herſelf in his way, and the King and his Confident liſten to their Converſation. 'Tis very eaſy to ſee he took the Hint of this Stratagem from the Story, though it is very differently conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for <hi>Ophelia</hi> is not a looſe Wanton as in the Hiſtory, but a Woman of Honour, with whom he is in love. The accidental killing of her Father, and her Diſtraction, which was cauſed by it, is all his own Invention, and would have made a very affecting Epiſode if the Lady had been more modeſt in her Frenzy, and the Lover more uniformly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for her Death; for at his firſt hearing it he expreſſes only a ſlight Emotion; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he jumps into her Grave, fiercely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be buried with her, fights with her Brother for profeſſing to love her, then grows calm, and never thinks of her any more.</p>
               <p>The Ghoſt is wholly the Invention of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> as is likewiſe the King's concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scheme with <hi>Laertes,</hi> to kill <hi>Hamlet</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly as they fenced, or if he failed to poiſon the Wine. The King is killed by <hi>Hamlet</hi> both in the Hiſtory and the Play, but
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0451201402:268"/>
in the Play he is ſtabb'd in the midſt of his Friends, Guards, and Attendants; in the Hiſtory as he is riſing in Confuſion from his Bed, and unable to draw his Sword to defend himſelf.</p>
               <p>Here the Hiſtorian, romantic as his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeems, has the Advantage of the Poet in Probability. After <hi>Amleth</hi> has ſecured his Uncle's Attendants, taken away his Sword from him, and placed his own, which was faſtened to the Scabbard, in its ſtead; it was not difficult for him to kill him diſarmed, and without any Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes <hi>Hamlet</hi> execute his Vengeance on the King in a public Hall, crouded with his Attendants and Guards, and ſurrounded by his Friends; none of theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to aſſiſt him, and <hi>Hamlet</hi> has leiſure enough after he has ſtabbed him to make him drink ſome of the Wine he had poiſoned, leſt his Sword had not compleated the Work.</p>
               <p>The Queen's Death, by drinking ignorantly of the poiſoned Wine is a beautiful Stroke of the Poet's. The Hiſtory ſhews her unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> makes the ſame Man who ſeduced her to Wickedneſs be her invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Murderer, and at once the Cauſe and Puniſher of her Guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has with Reaſon been cenſured for the Cataſtrophe of this Tragedy. The brave, the injured <hi>Hamlet</hi> falls with the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0451201402:269"/>
he puniſhes; one Fate overwhelms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the innocent and the guilty. In the Hiſtory we find he did not live long after the ſevere Revenge he took for his Father's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but was unfortunately killed in Battle. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> would not ſo far deviate from the Hiſtory as to leave him happy and in Peace, though he has haſtened his Death as well as changed the Manner of it. He is killed by the treacherous Contrivance of the King, and <hi>Laertes</hi> is the Inſtrument of that Treachery, which is afterwards turned upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Laertes</hi> is a ſubordinate Character in the Play, it ſeems to be a Fault in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> to ſhew him with a Similitude of Manners, under the ſame Circumſtances, and acting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Principles as <hi>Hamlet,</hi> his Hero. <hi>Laertes</hi> is brave and generous; his Father is murdered baſely as he is informed; Duty and Honour incite him to revenge his Death, and he does ſo.</p>
               <p>This Sameneſs of Character, and Parity of Circumſtances with the Hero, leſſens his Importance, and almoſt divides our Attention and Concern between them; an Effect which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> certainly did not intend to produce, nor can it be leſſened by the Conſideration of the treacherous Meaſures <hi>Laertes</hi> was prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to enter into againſt <hi>Hamlet,</hi> who had murdered his Father. In this he does not differ much from <hi>Hamlet,</hi> who did not attempt by open Force to revenge his Father's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0451201402:270"/>
on his Uncle, but deſigned to accompliſh it by Subtilty and Craft.</p>
               <p>The ſame Equality is preſerved in their Deaths, and in their Actions throughout the Play. <hi>Laertes</hi> wounds <hi>Hamlet</hi> with the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Weapon, in the Scuffle they change Rapiers, and <hi>Hamlet</hi> wounds <hi>Laertes,</hi> and they exchange Forgiveneſs with each other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they die.</p>
               <p>Thus has <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> undeſignedly, no doubt given us two Heroes inſtead of one in this Play; the only Difference between them is that one of them is a Prince, the other a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, and but for this ſlight Diſtinction the Play might have been as well called the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of Laertes</hi> as <hi>Hamlet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ought to be obſerved that <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has not been led into this Error by the Hiſtory; the Character of <hi>Laertes,</hi> and all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relating to him is his own, which he has introduced by making the Spy, who is killed, Father of <hi>Laertes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Madneſs of <hi>Hamlet</hi> ſeems to be leſs eſſential to the Play than the Hiſtory; in the latter it affords him the Means of executing a Contrivance, which, abſurd as it is, ſecures the Accompliſhment of his Revenge; but in the Play it is of no other Uſe than to enliven the Dialogue, unleſs its Uſefulneſs may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from its bringing on ſuch Accidents as it was aſſumed to prevent; for <hi>Hamlet</hi>'s Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0451201402:271"/>
alarms the King's Suſpicion, and that produces the treacherous Embaſſy to <hi>England,</hi> which failing, the Contrivance of the poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rapier followed, and that does the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>But ſince the King's conſcious Guilt and Terror might reaſonably have created a Diſtruſt of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> and that Diſtruſt, and a Deſire of Security induced him to ſeek his Death, what need had <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> to make his Heroe's Senſe and Diſcretion appear doubtful, by ſhewing him feigning a Madneſs, deſtructive to his Safety, and which he himſelf knows to be ſo, and yet perſiſts in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has indeed followed the Hiſtory in making <hi>Hamlet</hi> feign himſelf mad; but that Madneſs being of no Conſequence to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Deſign of the Play, as it is in the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or if of Conſequence it hurts the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Hero, 'tis certainly a Fault; for at leaſt he only produces the ſame Events by a Blunder, which might have happened without it.</p>
               <p>The Violation of poetical Juſtice is not the only Fault that ariſes from the Death of <hi>Hamlet;</hi> the revenging his Father's Murder is the ſole End of all his Deſigns, and the great Buſineſs of the Play, and the noble and fixed Reſolution of <hi>Hamlet</hi> to accompliſh it, makes up the moſt ſhining Part of his Character; yet this great End is delayed till after <hi>Hamlet</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0451201402:272"/>
is mortally wounded: He ſtabs the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Information of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery to himſelf! thus his Revenge becomes intereſted, and he ſeems to puniſh his Uncle rather for his own Death, than the Murder of the King, his Father.</p>
