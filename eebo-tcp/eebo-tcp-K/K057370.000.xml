            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>1ſt. [51—70]</hi> From Sympathy we rejoice in the pleaſures of others, and our affection is conciliated to their author;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1118400500:4"/>relation to him heightens that pleaſure; conſequently its greateſt ſtrength is, when that happineſs ſprings from our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and our own Virtue.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2d. [75—88]</hi> From Pride. The natural excellencies of the body or mind, when ſurveyed, neceſſarily give a ſpecies of pleaſure which we call ſelf-complacency or pride: this emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtronger on the perception of thoſe degrees of perfection, which we give birth to in ourſelves, by acts of the will; and is ſtill augmented in proportion of the dignity of the end by which it is put in action; the higheſt gratification of this inſtinct is therefore, the contemplation of thoſe of our own actions, to which ſome virtue was the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[89—92]</hi> From Shame. The converſe of the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holds good, as vice is attended with the greateſt degree of ſhame.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3d. [93—206]</hi> From Self-love. Self-love actuates our hopes and fears from a conſideration of—<hi>1ſt,</hi> our preſent, and—<hi>2dly,</hi> our future ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[93—134]</hi> From the preſent State.—Thoſe actions which promote the felicity of Society, (or the moral virtues) natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bring their own rewards with them: Thoſe which obſtruct it, (or vices) their reſpective puniſhments. Whence according to the nature of our actions, we are filled with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1118400500:5"/>the hopes of theſe rewards, or the fear of theſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and as the mind is always more employed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the future, than either the preſent or the paſt, theſe future expectations (which contribute to compoſe that moral ſenſe, named Conſcience) form the greater part of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happineſs or miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[135—206]</hi> From a future State.—Our hopes are ſtrongly excited by the views of that eternal happineſs, our fears by the repreſentation of the divine juſtice revelation has given us. Digreſſion. Deſcription of the divine juſtice; her infinity; her almighty power to protect—or puniſh. She deſcends upon earth to chaſtiſe the ſins of men; the effects of her vengeance. The terror a conſideration of this muſt inſpire in the breaſt of the wicked, and more particularly on the point of death.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V. [207—648]</hi> The <hi>FINAL CAUSES</hi> of <hi>CONSCIENCE.—1ſt,</hi> to excite repentance—<hi>2dly,</hi> to counterpoiſe the paſſions—<hi>3dly,</hi> to render the happineſs of individuals more propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their moral merits.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt. [213—220]</hi> Conſcience excites us by repentance to appeaſe the divine juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly. [221—262]</hi> It counterpoizes the paſſions, by making them ſubſervient to the general good; which otherwiſe would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1118400500:6"/>engage us in exceſſes the moſt deſtructive to ſociety. It introduces the fineſt moral harmony in the mind; and reconciles all the various purſuits of life to univerſal happineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly. [263—648]</hi> Vice is frequently ſucceſsful, and virtue depreſt in the world: Conſcience, by being the ſecret puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former, and the ſupport of the latter, renders the happineſs of each, more proportioned to the moral merit of individuals: and thus forms a neceſſary ſupplement to the external adminiſtration of providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[273—578]</hi> Hence unreſtrained Avarice, Ambition, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and other crimes derive their ſecret puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[579—610]</hi> And from hence the man of virtue when diſtreſt, experiences a ſupport, enabling him to triumph over or deſpiſe the afflictions of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[611—648]</hi> While its influence gives new pleaſure to all its finer enjoyments, and exalts proſperity into happineſs.</p>

The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of life are ſurveyed with pleaſure; the means by which theſe are procured are therefore pleaſing, by the operation of the mind aſſociating the pleaſure ariſing from the contemplation of the end, with the idea of the means: the foremoſt among theſe we reckon the natural excellencies of the body or mind: thus 'tis proved, there muſt exiſt ſuch a pleaſure as ſelf-complacence or pride, from a view of our natural perfections; if nature has not given us an original primary inſtinct, which makes the natural advantages neceſſarily and per ſe give pleaſure to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors. Ours is not the only language which wants a term which may expreſs ſelf-complacency, without the danger of being miſunderſtood without ſome explanation. Since the writing the above I have happened of the following obſervation on the word <hi>orgueil,</hi> which one of the beſt modern French poets wanted to have introduced in the ſenſe I have uſed the term Pride.—"J'aurois ſubſtitué le mot d'orgueil a ces mots, ſentiment de nos forces, de nos qualités, &amp;c. mais dans notre langue le mot d'or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueil ſe prend toujours en mauvaiſe part."
