            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I was indeed at firſt deterr'd from my Deſign, by a Thought that it might be accounted unpardonable Rudeneſs to obtrude a Trifle of this Nature to a Perſon, whoſe ſublime Wiſdome moderates that Council, which at this Critical Juncture, over-rules the Fate of all <hi>Europe.</hi> But then I was encourag'd by Reflecting, that <hi>Lelius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> the two greateſt Men in their

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
               <p>Why there 'tis now! a Man that wants Money thinks none can be unhappy that has it; but my Affairs are in ſuch a whimſical Poſture, that it will require a Calculation of my Nativity to find if my Gold will relieve me or not.</p>

               <p>Ha, ha, ha, never conſult the Stars about that; Gold has a Power beyond them; Gold unlocks the Midnight Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; Gold out-does the Wind, becalms the Ship, or fills her Sails; Gold is omnipotent below; it makes whole Armies fight, or fly; it buys even Souls, and bribes the Wretches to

               <p>Not a Souſe out of his Pocket, I aſſure you?

               <p>I am always ready, but what do's he intend to do with <hi>Miranda?</hi> Is ſhe to be ſold in private? or will he put her up by way of Auction, at who bids moſt? If ſo, Egad, I'm for him; my Gold, as you ſay, ſhall be ſubſervient to my Pleaſure.</p>

               <p>To deal ingenuouſly with you, Sir <hi>George,</hi> I know very little of Her, or Home; for ſince my Uncle's Death, and my Return from Travel, I have never been well with my Father; he thinks my Expences too great, and I his Allowance too little; he never ſees me, but he quarrels; and to avoid that, I ſhun his Houſe as much as poſſible. The Report is, he intends to marry her himſelf.</p>

               <p>Yes faith, ſo they ſay; but I tell you, I am wholly ignorant of the matter. <hi>Miranda</hi> and I are like two violent Members of a contrary Party; I can ſcarce allow her Beauty, tho' all the World do's; nor ſhe me Civility, for that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: I fancy ſhe plays the Mother-in-law already, and ſets the old Gentleman on to do miſchief.</p>

                  <p>What in the Balcone agen, notwithſtanding my poſitive Commands to the contrary!—Why don't you write a Bill upon your Fore-head, to ſhow Paſſengers there's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be let—</p>

                  <p>What harm can there be in a little freſh Air, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jeal.</speaker>
                  <p>Is your Conſtitution ſo hot, Miſtreſs, that it wants Cooling, ha? Apply the virtuous <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Rules, baniſh your Taſte, and Thoughts of Fleſh, feed upon Roots, and quench your Thriſt with Water.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Jeal.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Miſtreſs, 'tis your High-fed, Luſty, Rambling, Rampant Ladies—that are troubled with the Vapours; 'tis your Ratifia, Perſico, Cinnamon, Citron, and Spirit of Clary, cauſe ſuch Swi—m—ing in the Brain, that carries many a Guinea full-tide to the Doctor. But you are not to be bred this way; no Galloping abroad, no receiving Viſits at home; for in our looſe Country, the Women are as dangerous as the Men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patch.</speaker>
                  <p>So I told her, Sir; and that it was not Decent to be ſeen in a Balcone—But ſhe threatned to ſlap my Chaps, and told me, I was her Servant, not her Governeſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jeal.</speaker>
                  <p>Did ſhe ſo? But I'll make her to know, that you are her <hi>Duenna:</hi> Oh that incomparable Cuſtom of <hi>Spain!</hi> why here's no depending upon old Women in my Country—for they are as wanton at Eighty, as a Girl of Eighteen; and a Man may as ſafely truſt to <hi>Aſgill</hi>'s Tranſlation, as to his great Grand-Mother's not marrying agen.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jeal.</speaker>
                  <p>Dare to ridicule the cautious Conduct of that wiſe Nation, and I'll have you lock'd up this Fortnight without a Peep-hole.</p>

                  <p>If we had but the Ghoſtly Helps in <hi>England,</hi> which they have in <hi>Spain,</hi> I might deceive you if you did.—Sir, 'tis not the Reſtraint, but the Innate Principles, ſecures the Reputation and Honour of our Sex—Let me tell you, Sir, Confinement ſharpens the Invention, as want of Sight ſtrengthens the other Senſes, and is often more pernicious, than the Recreation innocent Liberty allows.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jeal.</speaker>
                  <p>Say you ſo, Miſtreſs; who the Devil taught you the Art of Reaſoning? I aſſure you, they muſt have a greater Faith than I pretend to, that can think any Woman innocent who requires Liberty. Therefore, <hi>Patch,</hi> to your Charge I give her; Lock her up till I come back from <hi>Change:</hi> I ſhall have ſome ſauntring Coxcomb, with nothing but a Red Coat and a Feather, think, by Leaping into her Arms, to Leap into my Eſtate—But I'll prevent them; ſhe ſhall be only Signeur <hi>Babinetto</hi>'s.</p>
