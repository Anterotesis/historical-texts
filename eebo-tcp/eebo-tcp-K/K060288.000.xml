            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is a Diſtemper of that inveterate and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Nature, as to be a continual Foil and Reproach to the beſt Phyſicians of all Ages: No Method of Phyſic, Diet or Habit, however regular, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and orderly, no Preſcriptions, tho' bearing the ſpecious and plauſible Sanction of Academic Graduate, and Collegate Learning, being able to give a Turn to this Diſtemper, or reach its ſecret Receſſes; for, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into the Extremities of the fine Capillary Veſſels, where, by reaſon of the unequal Celerity and languid Motion of the Blood in thoſe Parts, its venemous Particles are ſuffer'd to attract one another with great Violence: It bids Defiance to all their Art, and will oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yield to one lucky Noſtrum, than all the repeated Aſſaults of what they call Regular Practice, which is never more ineffectual and at a Loſs, than in this Caſe; and more eſpecially, if that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum be prepared as Theſe DROPS are, for ſuch a Species of Simples as are capable of being render'd, by ſuch Preparation, fit to pierce the very inmoſt nervous Colls, increaſe the Impetus of the Vital and Animal Fluids, and follow the Particles of the morbific Matter thro' all the fine Meanders of the Blood, till having diſturb'd their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and broke them, by repeated Colliſions, one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, into the minuteſt Parts, it forces moſt of them thro' the Pores of the Body by Perſpiration, obtunding, abſorbing, and carrying the reſt away with it in its Courſe, till arriving at the Kidneys, they are ſecreted there from the Blood, and paſs away by Urine. All which Operations, Theſe DROPS to a Miracle perform, by Virtue of their Diaphoretic, Abſorbent, and Detergent Qualities; opening at once all the Emunctories of the Body, and forcing off, through them, the very Root and Baſis of the Diſtemper they are to cure; and that this is the only effectual, rational Method of treating this obſtinate Diſtemper the Gout, I appeal to that great Searcher of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Dr. Sydenham, who ſays, Whatſoever is aſſiſtant in diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foul, vicious Humours, out of the Body, can never fail of anſwering the Intention of Cure for which it is deſign'd, whether in the Gout, Rheumatiſm, or any other Cronic Diſtemper. And his Authority, I ſhould think, ought not reaſonably to be diſputed in the Cure of this Diſtemper, whom, not only a vaſt Stock of acquir'd Learning, together with a prodigious natural Capacity, improv'd by long and great Practice, and Experience upon Others; but alſo a continued and unconquerable Gouty Habit in his own Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in this Opinion, That there was no other Method of treating this terrible Diſtemper; which is alſo confirm'd by what thoſe two admiral Phyſicians, Dr. Keile, and Dr. Quincey, have told us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Cauſe of it; which, ſay they, is created by the mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0962300900:5"/>Glands in the Joints becoming gritty and ſtiff, by Means of a ſharp acid Humour flowing thereon, which, coagulating the oily Liquor ſecreted by them for lubricating the Ends of the Bones at their ſeveral Articulations, to render them apt and ready for Motion, makes it, inſtead of promoting and aſſiſting that Motion, impeed, and prevent it, by clogging the Interſtices ſo that they cannot move at all, at leaſt, not without very great Pain, hard'ning, by Degrees, into white, chalky, gritty Stones, which are forced to be cut, or otherwiſe taken out by Art, from the Joints of the Hands and Feet of the miſerable Patient, as daily Experience manifeſts.</p>
            <p>Now you are to obſerve, That the Particles which compoſe this ſharp acid Humour, are ſurrounded with little pointed Needles, which wound and irritate the Veſſels thro' which they move, and the very Globules of the Blood itſelf, beating and coagulating thereby any Fluid with which they mix; but theſe being either obtunded and blunted, and the Points of them, as it were, ſheath'd and wrap'd up in ſome of the Particles of this Medicine, or elſe drove violently againſt one another with a Force ſufficiently to break off thoſe little pointed Spears, and render them capable of flying off by Perſpiration by others; or elſe ſo diſturb'd and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by this new Auxillary Force, that they cannot attract one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but un willingly diſperſe themſelves in the Blood, and are many of them ſecretted and carried off by Urine; This, I ſay, muſt neceſſarily anſwer the Intention of Cure; for by this Means they are render'd incapable of irritating, loading, or coagulating any of the Fluids; and then, on Courſe, the Diſtemper before caus'd by them, muſt by Degrees abate, and at length abſolutely ceaſe. To which Ends and Purpoſes, Theſe DROPs are ſo excellently adapted and prepar'd, and are in their Nature ſo very Abſorbent, Detergent and Diaphoretic, that it is morally impoſſible they ſhould fail of working a Cure, which can only be perform'd by the joint Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe three Qualities, which are ſcarce to be met with, in any conſiderable Degree, in any one Medicine in the World, but THIS alone.</p>
            <p>But, perhaps, ſome who underſtand no more of this Diſtemper than the Pain and Torture it gives them, will ſay, That, probably in the former Stage of this Diſtemper, theſe Drops may be effectual; but, ſay they, mine is in my Stomach, Bowels, &amp;c. and they will not be able to reach it there. But how weak and trivial an Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this is, will appear from a Reflection upon this Phaſe of the Gout, which is only caus'd by a Weakneſs and debility of Nature, thro' frequent Debauches, hard Drinking, long Courſes of uſeleſs Phyſic, &amp;c. whereby the Impetus of the Blood becomes ſo weak and languid, and its Motion ſo ſlow and irregular, as to permit the morbific Particles to attract one another in the Blood Veſſels of thoſe Parts, which can only be remedied by ſuch Things as warm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Blood's inteſtine Motion, ſo breaking and diſturbing the Attraction of the venemous Particles, and ſending them back again to the extream Parts, where they are to be treated as before: For which Purpoſe, nothing in Nature can be better fitted than Theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0962300900:6"/>Drops, which have ſuch a fine invigorating Alexiterial Property in them, as to render them one of the beſt Cardiacs in the whole Materia Medica.</p>
            <p>THE Doſe, in the former Phaſe of the Diſtemper, is a large Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in any warm Vehicle, as Mountain Wine, ſtrong Ale, &amp;c. made as hot as you can drink it, repeated three Nights ſucceſſively, going to Bed, and, by the Bleſſing of GOD, you need not fear Eaſe.</p>
            <p>But in the latter Phaſe, where the morbific Matter is not only to be repelled, but the faint and languid State of Nature enliven'd, and invigorated, it is neceſſary that you increaſe your Doſe as the Cauſe may require, in any warm Vehicle, as before; compoſing your ſelf after it, and encouraging the Sweat by all proper Methods.</p>
            <p>After this, in order effectually to rout this moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>errible Enemy; it is neceſſary you continue to take a ſmall Doſe of about 100, or 150 Drops, every. Three Nights alternately; taking three Nights, and miſſing three Nights; till ſuch time as you find the Strength of the Diſtemper to abate, which it will ſenſibly do in a ſmall time, and at length quite go off.</p>
            <p>Inſtances of the Cure of this Diſtemper, by Theſe DROPS, might be given in great Numbers, from Perſons of undoubted Credit, and Reputation, on enquiry, would ſatisfy the Curious of their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effect in that Intention; but not being willing to tire the Reader; and theſe Drops by their continual Succeſs, ſo ſtrongly recomending themſelves; I ſhall out of a very great multitude only trouble you with a few, as you will find at the end of this Treatiſe.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0962300900:7"/>are, inſtead of being aſſiſted therein by that lubricating Oil, impeeded and confin'd by the ſtiffneſs of the Coagulum, and the Rigidity and Harſhneſs of the ſurounding Membrance, 'till, by force of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fluid flowing into the Fibres, and extending them in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, they force it to give way; which is not without great Pain, and conſequent Weakneſs and Soreneſs of that Part: Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Pains cauſed by the unnatural Diſtentions of the Veſſels, from the Quantity of Viſcid Serum obſtructing them and hindring the free Circulation of the Blood; eſpecially in the fine Capillary Channells, without a conſiderable Dilatation; from whence, not ſeldom proceed Aſtma's, Pleuriſyes, Peripneumonys, Inflamations, Fevers and Death.</p>
            <p>This is only to be remedy'd by Diluents and Evacuating Medicines, as in the Gout; but not by any common Evacuators; many or moſt of which weaken Nature too much in their Operations, and being us'd without proper Diluents, will evap'rate all the real natural Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and leave nothing but a ſort of Serous Jelly in the Blood; which thereupon will either immediately Stagnate, or Efferveſce in ſuch a manner, as to cauſe a violent putrid Fever, and, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a Miracle, the certain Death of the Patient: It is true, they may eaſe the violent Pains of this Diſtemper, but if at the ſame time they increaſe the Inflamation, and Efferveſcence of the Blood, the Fever proportionably increaſes, and the poor deluded Patient dies; as too many do by common Practice: Whereas theſe DROPS dilute and expel what is redundant; whereby the Blood is reſtored to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Craſis, it's due Velocity, and Impetus recover'd, the Pains ceaſe, the Fever abates, perfect Health enſues. Beſides which by their Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterial, Cardiac Qualities, at the ſame time that they thus encreaſe the Impetus and Moment of the Fluids to the Diſcharge of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific Matter in Preſpiration; they alſo warm and comfort the whole nervous Siſtem, aſſiſt mightily in repairing the Waſte of the animal Spirits, occaſion'd thereby; which is evident in what has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid of them concerning the Gout in the Stomach, and Bowels, proceeding from a real Weakneſs and Decay of Nature.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, no Preparation was ever yet found out ſo ſuitable to the very Nature of this Diſtemper as theſe DROPS; which will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear from the vaſt number of Certificates of Cures wrought by them every Week, out of which I have thought fit to trouble you with but a few.</p>
            <p>THE Doſe and manner of ordering your ſelf, is the ſame as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed in the Gout; to be varied according to the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, and ſtrength of the Patient's Conſtitution, from 80, to 150 or 200 Drops, in any convenient Vehicle; which need not be ſo ſtrong and ſpiritous as in that Diſtemper; but muſt be drank as warm as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble going to Bed, and Covering your ſelf up warm, as before.</p>

            <p>This Diſtemper ariſes from obſtructions in the Glands of the Liver thereby preventing a due Secretion of the Gall from the Blood, by them, in that Viſcus, which Bilious Particles circulating therewith gives a Yellow Tiucture to the Mucus or Corpus Reticulare ſpread under the Cuticula, which from thence appears of that Colour: This is the firſt and common Phaſe of this Diſtemper; but it will ſometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE prodigious Variety of Cauſes from whence this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per proceeds, in different Conſtitutions, gives it ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Species and Degrees, as to render it one of the moſt difficult Diſorders to be skilfully manag'd of any affecting the human Syſtem. But the chief ſorts are, the Humid, the Dry, and the Nervous Aſthma; of each of which I will ſeparately give a few Hints concerning their Cauſes and Syſtems, and then proceeding to the Deſcription of the Effects of theſe Drops in all thoſe Intentions.</p>
            <p>But firſt, it is neceſſary to premiſe what an Aſthma is in general; That it is a frequent, difficult, and ſhort Reſpiration, or Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, join'd with a hiſſing Sound, and a Cough; eſpecially in the Night, in cold Weather, and in a prone Poſture, or lying down: The former becauſe the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere is greater in the Night than in the Day, when the noxious Vapours are exhal'd and diſpel'd by the Force of the Sun Beams. In the Night, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Pores of the Body being contracted by the circumambient Cold, our Tranſpiration is leſſen'd, and conſequently a Gravedo or Weight of perſpirable Matter enſues; which being flung upon the Lungs, clogs them, and renders them leſs apt to perform their Office; and in the laſt Caſe, from the Preſſure which the Contents of the Abdomen, when the Body is in that Poſture, make upon the Diaphragm, thereby leſſening the Capacity of the Thorax or Breaſt, ſo that the Lungs are too much confin'd, and cannot dilate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficient to receive a due Quantity of Air.</p>
            <p>This being premis'd, it will be eaſily underſtood, how theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kinds of Aſthmas are produc'd: The firſt or Humid, call'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Pleuretic Aſthma, ariſes from the Redundance of Rheumatic Serum, and viſcous Humours in the Blood, which being too thick to paſs through the ſmall Fibres of the Lungs ſtick cloſe to the Sides of thoſe Veſſels, and obſtruct the Blood in its Circulation; the Parts ſwell and often ulcerate, with great Pain, feveriſh Habbits, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing: Or elſe the pituitous Particles are ſpewed out into the Bronchiae, eſpecially if not impregnated with a due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0962300900:10"/>of Salts, cauſing a continual irritating Cough: In both which Caſes all inciding Pectorals are good, all Diaphoretics, and whatever attenuates and leſſens the Quantity of Serum; by that means depleting the extended Veſſels, and working a Revulſion of the ſtagnating Humours: Which nothing can better effect than theſe DROPS, which evacuate both by Perſpiration and Urine, and are certainly, at the ſame time, one of the very beſt Cardiacs in the whole World.</p>
            <p>The next Species of this Diſtemper, is the dry or plethoric Aſthma, caus'd either by too great a Repletion of a cachochy mious Blood call'd a Plethora, or elſe by too great a Rarefaction of that Fluid in its Veſſels; ſo that the fine Canalls of the Lungs are too far diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and conſequently there is not room enough for the Air to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flate the Veſſels, which produces an Inability of Reſpiration, for want of a due Degree of Expanſion in that Viſcus: Such Perſons are generally crying out for Air; they always ſeem as if girted hard upon their Cheſt, and are almoſt become Victims to a long Scorbutick Cachetic Habit; of which this is the laſt, and oftentimes, for want of proper Remrdies apply'd in time, fatal Symptoms; for in this Caſe there is no time to uſe Alteratives, which work but ſlowly in the Maſs of Blood; whereas, here we want an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Aſſiſtance; which can only be obtain'd by a Conjunction of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacs and Diapheretics, both which Qualities are eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable in theſe DROPS; which can therefore never fail the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cure in this Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>The Third and laſt Sort of Aſthma I ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on'd, was the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; which is occaſion'd by a Deficiency of the Pectoral Muſcles, for want of a ſufficient Quantity of Spirits to nouriſh and contract them; and is the dire Effect of a nervous Atrophy; and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd by high, and vigorous Cardiacs; to rouſe and invigorate decaying Nature, and, as it were, re-enkindle the almoſt extinguiſh'd Lamp of Life; which nothing can perform more effectually than theſe DROPS, which have a prodigious Influence in reviving the drooping Spirits, warming and comforting the Nerves, encreaſing the Moment of the Blood, and doing every other Office requiſite to call back the almoſt fleeting Life, by their admirable Cardiac Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; inſomuch that many have been reſtor'd to a Miracle, from even Death's Door by them alone, both in this and other Caſes.</p>
            <p>THE Doſe in all theſe three Caſes, is as before in the Gout, in any convenient Vehicle, but good Mountain Wine is beſt, if it can be procur'd, made very warm, as before; and taking Care you do not get Cold after it.</p>

            <p>I Put theſe Diſtempers all in one Claſs, becauſe they have a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Relation the one to the other, as the Cauſe has to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, &amp; Econtia, and as different Effects produced from the ſame Cauſe have to one another; for it may generally be allow'd,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0962300900:11"/>that what we call Colds are the Baſis, or Groundwork of moſt of thoſe Epedemic Fevers, which ſo commonly rage in this Kingdom: for perſpiration being diminiſh'd thro' a Contraction of the pores, caus'd by the perception of external Cold, the perſpirable Matter flies off in a leſs Quantity than when the pores are more relax'd; and that part thereof which cannot get out, returns back into the Blood, which it heats and irritates more or leſs, according to the Quantity of Matter retain'd, forcing it to diſtend it's Veſſels, and producing thence frequently a Solutio continui, whence follows the Idea of pain in that part, with a Gravedo or He wineſs of the whole Frame, but eſpecially of the diſeas'd part; or elſe, a Coryza or Defluxion of ſerous, ſharp Humours from the Glands of the Head, thro' the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, &amp;c. from whence, if ſpeedy Care is not taken, are engender'd Aſthma's, Conſumptions, Fevers, &amp;c. and a whole Train of Evils which may be eaſily and certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by a timely Uſe of ſome proper Evacuator, which ſhall by its Diaphoretic Quality, diſcharge the Blood of its Load of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign deleterious Matter; and force off the offending Particles thro' the Pores; which we call Sweating: To which Purpoſe, there is no one Thing in Nature more effectual than theſe Drops, which are a moſt powerful Diaphoretic, and never fail of Succeſs in the moſt ſtubborn Cold whatever.

            <p>And ſo 'tis here, a ſingle Doſe ſeldom or never fails curing a Cold, whereas if you let that Cold grow into a Fever, it may be the Work of ſeveral to compleat the Cure; and glad you may be to come off ſo; for nothing corrupts the Blood more than a Cold, by irritating, and inflaming it to the higheſt Degree; whence proceed Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which if not evacuated by proper Remedies, increaſe the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and often generate acute, putrid, and malignant Fevers, whoſe dire Effects daily Examples ſufficiently demonſtrate to every one's Experience.

            <p>As for Agues they are only the Intermiſſions of Fevers, the cold Fit being only an accidental, and not an eſſential Property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; ſo that as they are properly a Species of a Fever, they are to be treated after the ſame Manner, and the Method and Intention of Cure, is the very ſame; and if ſo then conſequently the ſame Remedy that prevails againſt one, cannot fail in the other.</p>
            <p>And here, I cannot omit mentioning one peculiar Property in theſe Drops, ſufficient of its ſelf to recommend them effectually to all the reaſonable Part of Mankind; who are not wedded to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical Error; and that is, their moſt powerful Energy in clearing the Blood from the Dregs of that faſhionable (but in many Caſes pernicious) Drug the Bark of Peru; commonly call'd, The Jeſuites Bark. This is the publick Aſylum of Mankind, the Panacea of the World, the ſovereign and univerſal Orvietem againſt all the Diſeaſes of Pandora's Box, and what not, in the Opinion of thoſe valetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarian Wretches, who dare not eat a Meal's Meat, open a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Window, or ſo much as go to Stool, without the Leave of their Phyſician; whoſe conſtant Preſcription is ſtill the Bark, in ſome Form or other: If Madam has got a Fit of the Vapours, the Bark will chear her Spirits; If ſhe has taken too plentiful a Doſe of Ratifea, the Bark will make her as ſober as a Nun; If ſhe is Loveſick, the Bark is to moderate her Deſires; and if ſhe's in the raging Fever of Jealouſy, the Bark is to make her believe that her Husband is as conſtant as a Turtle: In ſhort, whenever the Privy-Counceller of Health is at a Loſs what to do for his Guinea, he perſuades his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhe has an Intermitting Fever, and Bark is the Word to ſave the Expence of further thinking. Now by this you may judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this gigantic Protean Drug, which is whimſically apply'd to ſo many chimaerical Evils, is of any valuable Uſe, any ſubſtantial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to Mankind in real Diſorders, and Maladies, ariſing from a vitiated State of the Fluids. We ſeldom play with ſerious Matters, nor make Children Rattles of Diamonds. One learned Practitioner ſays, the Bark is a violent Styptic, and Aſtringent; another, it is ſolutive, and will of it's ſelf, without proper Alteratives, paſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately downwards; One ſays it conſiſts of a fix't Salt. another of a volatile, and a third that it is a Compoſite of both: One that it gives a Spur to the inteſtine Motion of the Blood; another that it locks up every Thing in the Blood, Some and thoſe of Note too aſſert, that if given in large Quantities, it will by 'tis attenuating Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty create an Anaſarca, or Dropſy; others that it is itſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if taken in Time to cure a Dropſy: One forbids the Uſe of it in Rheumatick Fevers, for fear it's attenuating Virtue rarely the Maſs of Blood, and thereby enlarge the Dimenſions of it's Veſſels, ſo far, as to occaſion an Aneuriſma or Rupture, or at leaſt greatly encreaſe the Idea of pain, of which Opinion, are no leſs Men then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Morton and Sydenham; whereas another later practitioner, no ways inferiour to either, by all means indicates the Bark in this Caſe, grounding his Notion upon Reaſon, and to uſe his own Words, conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now if this be the Caſe, that theſe great and learned Men cannot agree among themſelves, neither as to the Nature, nor Effect of this magical Drug; is it not greatly to be fear'd, and that with very good Reaſon, that if one is miſtaken, they may all of them be ſo; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof will be, that this famous panacea, like the Jay in the Fable, ſtrip't of all it's borrow'd pomp, will appear to be of no other Uſe, but to fill up the Variety of Nature's Works; receiving a value only from Opinion, grounded on the Weakneſs of one part of the World, and the Wileyneſs of the other.</p>
            <p>But if there be ana Virtue in this Drug, the Taſt itſelf ſeems to point it out to be Styptic, and Aſtringent, which is alſo generally allow'd by all who have any Skill in it; while for Faſhion ſake they admit of other Qualities, as it were by preſcriptive Right; and for Intereſt invent new ones to authorize it's Adminiſtration in ſome preſent Neceſſity: Now, if once it is allow'd, the Bark is Styptick and Aſtringent, it points out directly to the Manner of it's Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Effect; in ſeemingly giving a Turn to ſome certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical Exacerbations; for which it is more generally adminiſſer'd, as intermitting Fevers, Hemicranea's, Haemoptoes, Epilepſies, and Hyſteries; which ſays a great and learned Author, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by the Cortex only; but what Way is this Relief to be had? why, ſays the ſame Author, the Cortex locks up the febrile Ferment in the Blood; and, ſays he, in another Place, If Catharticks be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſoon after it they make the Type of the Fever return in it's old Shape, for when the Bark is carried off, what locks up the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? From whence I conclude, that this mighty Medicine, like a cunning Mountebank, deludes us with plauſible Appearances, and inſtead of really working a Cure, only poſtpones the Exacerbation, it may be for a Week, or a Fortnight, by locking the Cauſe up in the Veins; which upon any accidental Cold, little Irregularity, or imprudent Management, breaks out again with double Violence; the Conſequence whereof is not ſeldom attended with the Death of the Patient, as common Experience daily confirms; unleſs with Morton you continue doſing your Patient with it every ten Days, till the next Syzygy; or elſe with another gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
