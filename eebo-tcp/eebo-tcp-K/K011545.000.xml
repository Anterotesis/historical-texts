            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To Mr. <hi>POPE.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am ſo little inclin'd to trouble even Men of Merit, with the Addreſs of ſuch Trifles as Theſe, that it was impoſſible I ſhou'd ſo much as have thought of Yourſelf with that View, if Honeſt <hi>Bernard,</hi> your Bookſeller, had not inform'd me, That You (I ſuppoſe it was out of the Fulneſs of your known Zeal for our Church and Conſtitution) had taken upon you to aſſert, that Printing any thing in Praiſe of the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> wou'd be receiv'd as a Satyr on the Government.</p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible, that under this Diſguiſe of Opinion, Your Exceſs of Good-breeding may have conceal'd your Diſlike of the Performance; for I find it a Difficulty to conceive, how ſo whimſical an Objection cou'd come into a Head, ſo well ſtor'd with Judgment, as we are to conclude Yours to be, from Your <hi>Eſſay on Criticiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let either of theſe ſage Caſes be the Right, I conſider their Importance as Equal; and take this Occaſion, with a Frankneſs, like Your own, to aſſure You, that my Eſteem for Your <hi>Genius</hi> as a Poet, is ſo very conſiderable, that it is hardly exceeded by my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Your Vanity.</p>
            <p>What led me to embrace an Opportunity of knowing Your Opinion, was a Diſpoſition which two Lines in Your <hi>Eſſay</hi> above-mention'd ſhall explain for me;</p>
            <l>Truſt not Your-ſelf; but Your Defects to know,</l>
            <l>Make Uſe of Ev'ry Friend:—And Ev'ry Foe:</l>
            <p>I cou'd not, I confeſs, conſider you as a <hi>Friend,</hi> having that very great Misfortune to languiſh under, of not being reckon'd in the Number of Your Acquaintance: But in the <hi>Laſt</hi> of the two Lights, I preſum'd, I might regard You, ſince Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> for whoſe Skill in Judging I profeſs an Eſteem, has aſſured us, that You are a Kind of <hi>Foe</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body but Your-ſelf, and on that Foundation, ſupports his rough Attempt <hi>to pull the Lyon's Skin from a certain little Aſs</hi> he there mentions, and I fear he means You, Sir.</p>
            <p>When I conſider'd You in this Character, I made no doubt but any Poem wou'd have had the Good Fortune to come out of Your Hands well examined, that I ſhou'd have heard of <hi>Rough Verſe,</hi> improper <hi>Sentiments,</hi> and a World of <hi>Poetical</hi> Errors: But I profeſs Your Penetration over-ſhot all my Fears, and I cannot find Words to expreſs my Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Your Capacity, when Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> liſp'd out, That Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſaid, <hi>there were ſeveral good Things in the</hi> Northern-Star, <hi>BUT, it would be taken for an Inſult on the Government: FOR, tho' the</hi> Czar <hi>is King</hi> George <hi>'s Ally; yet we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to quarrel with</hi> Sweden; <hi>and</hi> Muſcovy, whiſper'd Bernard, <hi>lies, he ſays, in the North!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this pleaſant Diſcovery was Your Real Opinion, we muſt, I'm aſraid, learn to <hi>pity</hi> the Weakneſs of a Judgment, which, I know, is Heroic enough to wiſh rather for <hi>Envy, tho' a ſturdier Paſſion, and agree with You heartily, that,</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <hi>A</hi> Little Learning <hi>is a dangerous Thing.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>But if you diſlik'd the Poem, as a Poem, why did you not fairly avow the Diſreliſh? I could have own'd a Conviction of Error, with the ſame Satisfaction, I feel, when I repay a Civility. Shall I put you in Mind, that Diſlike not own'd openly, ſtands condemn'd by a Judge, whoſe Sentence Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> of all Mankind, will be the laſt to appeal from,</p>
            <l>Be Niggards of Advice, on no Pretence,</l>
            <l>For the worſt Avarice is that of Senſe:</l>
            <l>With mean Complacence ne'er betray your Truſt,</l>
            <l>Nor be ſo civil, as to prove unjuſt:</l>
            <p>Pope <hi>'s Eſſay on Criticiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt, by no Means, imagine, that a ſupercilious Reſult, from Neglect of examining into the Merits of a Cauſe, he pretends to decide, can he charg'd with any Juſtice on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the following Lines, unleſs he was religious enough to write them, with Deſign to laſh himſelf by Way of Penance.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Of all the Cauſes, which conſpire to blind</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Man's Erring Judgment, and miſguide the Mind;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>What the weak Head, with ſtrongeſt Byaſs, rules,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Is,</hi> Pride, <hi>the neverfailing Vice of Fools.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Whatever Nature has, in Worth, deny'd,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>She gives. in large Recruits, of needful Pride:</hi>
            </l>
            <p>In ſhort, if I writ Verſe often enough to make my Vanity Rampant; I ſhould ſhrewdly ſuſpect, that you were mightily taken with this Poem, ſince you thought it worth your while
<pb facs="tcp:0160702700:3"/>
to give it an ill Charàcter; for You<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who rever iie, have told the World, and I ſuppoſe you aſſert Nothing but from Your own Knowledge,</p>
            <l>That ſtill the Worſt with moſt Regret, Commend,</l>
            <l>And each bad Writer is as bad a Friend.</l>
            <l>And while Self-Love each jealous Writer rules,</l>
            <l>Contending Wits become the Sport of Fools:</l>
            <p>But. if I was not afraid, that You wou'd think me Ill-natur'd, I wou'd obſerve in your Favour, on this Occaſion, that tho' all theſe foregoing Verſes are Your own Words, they way poſibly be very different from Your Sentiments; for I remember, that, among the reſt, You, tell us, by Way of Warning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Men of Wit may their own Rules invade,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As Kings diſpenſe with Laws, themſelves have made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will therefore take Advantage, from my having been pretty converſant with your Writings, to ſeek a better Reaſon yet, for the Oddneſs of your Notion, that this <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern-Star</hi> is a Satyr on the <hi>Government.</hi> Your abovemention'd Cabinet of Sentences is ſo well furniſhed, that, like a Maſquerade-ſhop at <hi>Venice.</hi> it will give a Man what Face he pleaſes in a Twinkling; but I preſume, I have hit the Right Nail, when I ſtop at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Simile.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>All ſeems infected, that th' infected Spy,</l>
            <l>As all looks Yellow to the Jaundic'd Eve:</l>
            <p>But however, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Teague</hi> in the Comedy, finds his Mouth run from one Side to the other, and cannot for his Life ſay <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> to Mrs. <hi>Day,</hi> without laughing in her Face, I cannot without much Difficulty grow Grave, when I compare the Judge with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; yet to allow all poſſible fair Quarter, let us ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Czar,</hi> as He is not; were now actually our Enemy—Are his Merits leſs ſhining? Does His Glory depend on His Friendſhip for <hi>Britain?</hi> Contemptible Meanneſs of Thought! Is it neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards becoming a <hi>Patriot,</hi> among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that every Thing muſt be hated, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Foreign?</hi> At that Rate the <hi>toto diviſos orbe Britannos</hi> wou'd be more applicable to our Humour than it is to our Sitvation.</p>
            <p>Next to deſerving well ourſelves, it is the nobleſt Perfection of Nature, to admire and applaud thoſe, who do ſo; But to have no Ear open to Renown at a Diſtance, were baſe, vain and brutal, equally diſtaſteful to Humanity and Wiſdom. We may talk what we pleaſe of our <hi>Natural Advantages.</hi> There is one <hi>Natural Defect,</hi> which will ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow them All; and which makes it impoſſible to widen our Power, till we enlarge our Conceptions.</p>
            <p>I am apt to believe that Nothing has contributed more to this Narrowneſs of Mind, than the Flatteries of our Poets: who generally writing for a precarious Subſiſtance, can no Way ſo eaſily ſucceed, as by falling in with the Weakneſs and Byaſs of Mens Natures; and hence all our Women are Nymphs, Angels, or Goddeſſes; our Men, Demi-Hero's; all our Soldiers are invincible; all our Generals beyond <hi>Caeſar;</hi> all our Kings like <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> and every Lord who has a Penny in his Pocket, and a Crotchet in His Imagination, a very <hi>Mecaenas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Poet ſhou'd ſometimes ſtand high, and look wide for a Subject; If He is always Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, He will be often unnatural. <hi>Virgil's</hi> celebrated Praiſe of his <hi>Italy,</hi> had been Falſhood and F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>attery, apply'd to <hi>Great Britain.</hi> He knew and admired the Delights of His Country, and acted as became Him, when he juſtly commended them. But our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Poets, whoſe utmoſt Reach of Skill is a <hi>Poor Imitation,</hi> forget that they make <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> contemptible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtead of ornamenting their Subject, when Peace in <hi>our</hi> Climate is dreſs'd in her <hi>Olives;</hi> when <hi>Pan</hi> fills our Woods, and <hi>Tritons</hi> our Seas; and our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds <hi>ſit Piping,</hi> like the Swains of <hi>Arcadia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A meer Poet, that is to ſay, a Wretch, who has nothing but the Jingle in his Brain to ring Chimes to his Vanity, and whoſe whole Trade is Rhyme-jobbirg; ſuch a Creature is certainly the moſt worthleſs Incumbrance of his Country. His Arrogance is the only Thing more Remarkable than his Ignorance. The fantaſtical Merit that ſwells him, is, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ill-Humors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more noxious for its Thinneſs. Uſeful Science is an Air much too Groſs for His Intellects: Biting Scorn, and Univerſal Neglect turn their Points on His Conceitedneſs, and while the whole World ſtrives in vain to correct him by Diſgrace and Reproaches, All that Tempeſt to Him is no more, than Blowing Wind in a Bladder, the ſtronger the Puff, the more boiſterous the Swelling.</p>
            <p>All this, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> muſt reeds know, between his double Capacity, of <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Critic;</hi> and, if ſo, He has given a Judgment, as well corrupt, as ridiculous, in attributing to <hi>Party</hi> the Endeavours of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> But if after all, it was not the <hi>Subject,</hi> but the <hi>Poem,</hi> that found no Favour in His Eyes, I will take upon me to aſſure Him, it ſues not for the Bleſſing: Let him like it as ill as He pleaſes, I dare at leaſt, undertake, it ſhall eaſily defend it ſelf againſt any Attack, of His making; which, pray Sir, inform Him, ſince you are His greateſt Admirer, and oblige</p>

            <p n="1">(1) I Call <hi>Ruſſia The Land of Night,</hi> not only <hi>Literally,</hi> as its general Diſtance from the Sun occaſions tedious and uncomfortable Winters, but alſo in a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical</hi> Senſe, becauſe an almoſt total Abſence of the Arts (till this <hi>Czar</hi>'s Reign) had wrapt the Country in a Night of Ignorance.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>In that Contracted Name. Czar</hi> is a Contraction of the Word <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and is us'd to ſignify a King, or Emperor, not only in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Tongue, but the <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian,</hi> and ſome others; and, no doubt, deriv'd its Riſe from that Title of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors. Nor is there any other Difference in the Words than the Contraction only, ſince the antient Latin Pronunciation was not <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as we ſpeak it, but the <hi>C</hi> being pronounc'd as a <hi>K,</hi> made <hi>Kaiſar,</hi> and, in that Manner, it was undoubtedly ſpoken by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Germans have no other Title for the Emperors to this Day, than <hi>Kaiſar,</hi> which the ſmalleſt Variation changes into <hi>Czar,</hi> according to the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Appellation.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Almoſt ow'd Diſtinction to his Hand.</hi> Tho' the <hi>Czars</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> have for many Ages been poſſeſs'd of very large Dominions, and a Power as extenſive, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, as moſt other Princes; yet, partly by their diſtant Situation, and partly by their Want of Skill in Arms and Arts, it is certain that they are but lately become Known to theſe Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and were never formidable, 'till they ow'd it to the Genius of their preſent Monarch.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>Gave their ſcatter'd Limbs a Head.</hi> Every Body knows that <hi>Theſeus</hi> gather'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> into a Body, from a diſpers'd and ſolitary Way of living; and founded and peopled the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> which was before but a little Village, tho' a Kingly Seat, where he brought them to a Reliſh of Society, and uſefully, inſtructed them in the Knowledge of improving their united Power.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) <hi>Nations, Numberleſs as Lybian Sands.</hi> The <hi>Hyperbole</hi> may plead more than Poetical Licence to excuſe it; for, if, according to the Practice of Great Part of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> each diſtinct <hi>Tribe</hi> or <hi>Herd,</hi> may be indulg'd in their Ambition to be thought a particular <hi>Nation,</hi> as moſt Writers have practis'd, Then may the petty <hi>Herds</hi> of <hi>Tartars,</hi> almoſt every where ſurrounding <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> added to the wild Variety of Inhabitants in <hi>Siberia, Samoieda, &amp;c.</hi> who depend upon the <hi>Czar,</hi> be call'd <hi>Numberleſs,</hi> without much Help from the <hi>Hyperbole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6) <hi>The Shaggy Samoid.</hi> The <hi>Samoiedes</hi> are a People ſubject to the <hi>Czar,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting a large Tract of Land, from <hi>Nova Zemla,</hi> to the Neighbourhood of <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,</hi> and extending along the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Sea. They neither Plough nor Sow, their Country being too cold to produce Corn; ſo that they live chiefly on dry'd Fiſh and Turneps, and the Fleſh of a Kind of Deer, which feeds on the Moſs of their Heaths: And, with the Skins of theſe Deer, having a very thick, warm Fur, they cloath and defend themſelves from the Sharpneſs of the Froſt, and covering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all over, keep the Snow from blowing in at their Necks; and live three Months, in the Year, without Sight of the Sun.</p>
            <p n="7">(7) <hi>O'er Lands, where ſcarce the Ruſſian Name has paſt.</hi> Notwithſtanding the juſt Notion, which <hi>Europe</hi> has conceiv'd for ſome Years paſt, of the formidable Power of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Arms, yet is their Country ſo little known, to the Generality of other Nations, that it is almoſt Univerſally called <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> tho' that is only the Name of its old Capital <hi>Muſcow:</hi> And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might, with the ſame Juſtice, in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, be called by no other Name than The <hi>Londoners.</hi>
            </p>

The Terror this Defeat occaſion'd at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ſo great, that they built new Caſtles on the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> and took all poſſible Precautions to prevent ſome future Attempt that Way, by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Navy; but ſo much in Vain, that I am convinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d and could juſtify it by Reaſon and Demonſtration, that, if the <hi>Czar</hi> ſhou'd, as it is now likely he will, declare War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> he may, with the ſmalleſt Expence, or Hazard, imaginable, begin his Succeſs by laying <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in Aſhes, or poſſeſſing it, if he pleaſes, and maintaining it againſt all poſſible Efforts of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power.</p>
            <p n="11">(11) <hi>Yok'd Helleſpont.</hi> The Paſſage of this famous Chanel is guarded, and made as the <hi>Turks</hi> falſly believe, impoſſible to be forc'd, by two old Caſtles, called the <hi>Dardanelles;</hi> one ſeated on the <hi>Aſian</hi> Side, the other on the <hi>European,</hi> about three Quarters of a Mile aſunder; and having each a Platform of prodigious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of-Size Artillery, carrying Stone Bullets of two or three Foot Diameter.</p>
            <p n="12">(12) <hi>Now greet their</hi> Ruſſia <hi>by an untry'd Way.</hi> If <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were in the Hands of the <hi>Czar;</hi> and the <hi>Helleſpont;</hi> by that Means ſubject to Him, His Ships from the South Parts of His Dominions, bordering on <hi>Circaſſia,</hi> might, thro' the <hi>Boſphorus, Propontis, Helleſpont,</hi> and <hi>Aegean,</hi> paſs into the <hi>Mediterran an,</hi> and coming thro' the Streights Mouth, ſail <hi>Northward,</hi> and reach <hi>Ruſſia</hi> again, at the Port of <hi>Archangel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">(13) <hi>Feel their Pride ſhake,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Chineſe,</hi> tho' vaſtly diſtant from <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> have been warr'd upon by that Nation, and made to conceive very different Idea's of them, from thoſe which their Pride had before ſuggeſted to them: And the <hi>Czar</hi> duely ſenſible of the many Advantages, which may ariſe from a perfect Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that Immenſity of Deſart, which divides Him from <hi>China,</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated that Deſign, and built Forts and large Towns, all the Way, at proper Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for the Defence, and Entertainment of His Subjects, who travel, every Year from one Empire to the other by Land, carrying out and bringing back ſuch Commodities, as are moſt in Demand by the Merchants of both Nations. They ſet out, when the Winter has cover'd all the Country with Snow, and the Surface of that Snow is ſo harden'd by Froſt, that they are drawn with great Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over it, in Sleds, by a large Kind of Deer; they, who ride in the Sled, being cover'd with thick, and warm Furs, for Defence againſt the Severity of the Cold.</p>
            <p n="14">(14) <hi>Where Proud Diſcov'ry has ſo oft been loſt.</hi> Abundance of Ships have been loſt, and great Numbers of excellent Mariners been frozen to Death, in the Search of a North Eaſtern Paſſage to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> by the Way of <hi>Nova Zemla,</hi> and the great Sea of <hi>Tartary.</hi> If there is ſuch a Paſſage, as there muſt be, unleſs the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Dominions are join'd on the North, to <hi>America,</hi> The <hi>Czar</hi> has a Deſign to diſcover it; and will undoubtedly ſucceed in it, becauſe His Situation affords him an Advantage, which no other Monarch is Maſter of.</p>
            <p n="15">(15) <hi>Prophetic Greece re-hopes Her own.</hi> There has, long, been a Prophecy among the <hi>Greeks.</hi> that their Redemption from the <hi>Turkiſh Yoke,</hi> ſhall be owing to a fair, white hair'd People from the North; and they are ſtrongly, and univerſally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> are the People, meant in the Prophecy.</p>
            <p n="16">(16) <hi>And, when eight hundred lab'ring Tears were paſt.</hi> Tho' the <hi>Romans,</hi> aſſiſted by the Strength of their National Virtue, in the Infancy of their Power, grew ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly Glorious, yet they reach'd not the Height of their Empire, till the Days of <hi>Trajan;</hi> which Summit of Authority is hinted at by the <hi>Aſpiring to Rule,</hi> and <hi>Panting after Fame,</hi> in the Poem.</p>
